## 📝 Reflecting on Values - LLMs
**Date**: 2023-08-07 | **Source**: chatgpt

> can you help me rewrite this so that the UAE wont be offended by sensitivities about using the word God and mentioning religious things? 
Article ideas:
Personal and private LLMs connected and fine tuned on your life data - including biometric data from watches, and audio transcription of your surrounding environment.
Evening Muraja3a / muhasaba conversation ends the day with:
What’s one way how you lived your values today
What’s one way you’ve let yourself down by not upholding your values.
The information about which name of God would be most helpful for you is broadcast locally on bluetooth, encrypted and anonymized. Local mosques act as nodes which can collect and an aggregated set of custom prayers are offered to their local imams to use to pray for them during the group prayers, particularly fajir. Hearing their specific needs expressed without needing to “out” themselves bonds the people in the prayer hall. 
Pervasive AR highlights areas in your visual field that relate to the current name of God the person seeks to manifest. A subtle extra glow.

Cities and parks are designed with different areas representing and attempting to imbue the atmosphere with the different names of God.
These areas are wisely designed to overlay multiple synergistic names, like Al Muqsit and Al Ghaffar (The Just and The Forgiver) to bring balance and allow for serendipitous encounters of opposite seekers meeting.
People looking to bring in Al Halim might go and city volunteers and officials are trained to support people in exploring this aspect. 
This designs for serendipity and chance encounters 
Based on attendance in parks, and names sent to local mosques. Municipalities get a deeper understanding of citizen needs while preserving privacy. These municipalities can then strategically replace billboards with reminders of divine qualities, incentivise local cultural activities and guide the local imams.
Fundamentally though, there real change is orienting a life around knowledge of God, making that a common conversation with oneself, our neighbors, and local community. 
The person is still responsible to act, the machines can’t give us “the right thing” they must only nudge ever so slightly and help direct attention. 


Exploring using LLMs to craft custom thikrs based on  current life challenges:

Frustrated with my own judgment against my father, he is sick yet is also using his sickness to be lazy and demanding- or at least it seems like that. So I’m angry with him and also angry at myself for being g angry 


Better voices:
It sounds like you're experiencing a difficult emotional situation. In Islamic tradition, "Al-Halim" might be an appropriate name of God to reflect on in this case. "Al-Halim" means "The Forbearing" or "The Patient", representing God's infinite patience and forbearance.

Your dhikr could be: "Ya Halim," which means "O Forbearing One." This repetition could help you strive for patience, understanding, and forgiveness, both for your father and for yourself.

As you perform this dhikr, it might be helpful to contemplate on the quality of forbearance in your own life. Think of how God is patient with all of His creations and how you might bring that quality into your relationship with your father and with yourself. This is a journey, so be patient and kind to yourself as you work through these feelings.

In addition to the repetition of the name "Ya Halim," there are several ways you can incorporate this dhikr into your life to remind yourself of the virtue of forbearance:

Reflection and Prayer: You can use the name "Al-Halim" during your prayers or quiet contemplation. Reflect on the meaning of this name and ask God to grant you the forbearance it signifies.

Writing: You might find it helpful to write down "Ya Halim" in places where you'll frequently see it, such as a personal journal, sticky notes on your desk, or a digital reminder on your phone. This will serve as a constant reminder to embody forbearance.
Mindfulness: Try to practice mindfulness and when you find yourself feeling angry or frustrated, remind yourself of "Ya Halim." This could help to calm your mind and refocus your emotions.

Discussion and Learning: You could also consider discussing the concept of Al-Halim with other people, such as in a study group or an online forum. This could offer new perspectives and deepen your understanding.

Service: Serving others, particularly those who are difficult to deal with, can be a practical way to cultivate forbearance. As you interact with others, keep the dhikr "Ya Halim" in mind.
Remember, the goal is not just to repeat the name, but to let it shape your thoughts, feelings, and actions towards greater patience and understanding. The more you incorporate it into your daily life, the more naturally it will come to you in difficult moments.

## 📝 Challenge: Name Remembrance
**Date**: 2023-08-06 | **Source**: chatgpt

> I would like you to look at the Islamic tradition of all of the 99 names of God and the different quote-unquote antidotes that different mystics and Sufis and teachers would give to people in terms of reminders that use God's name in the Muslim tradition. So for instance, al-Sabur is for patience. There have been books about this. I'm going to tell you a challenge that I'm facing and then I want you to identify a remembrance or dhikr spelled t-h-i-k-r for me to perform, to remember a name of God and support me based on the values that I would like to express. So if my challenges need me to access more of a confident sort of posture, what name or remembrance will help me bring that into being?
I will give you a challenge once you ask me then send me my thikr

For some reason I see a circle and I don't see the sun svg anymore can you explain why crique the code and help me fix it

> it seems to be being overlapped or covered by the 
          <PrayerArcs prayerTimes={prayerTimes} width={width} height={height} />
In this code:
 <View style={styles[currentPrayer || '']}>
      {prayerTimes && (
        <>
          <PrayerArcs prayerTimes={prayerTimes} width={width} height={height} />
                    <Sun prayerTimes={prayerTimes} />

        </>
      )}
    </View>  );
};
because when I remove it I see it. Maybe we can change z index or make one transparent or something?

I like the simpler code

type PrayerTimes = {

const transformPrayerTimes = (data: any): PrayerTimes => {
  return {
    Fajr: data.Fajr,
    Sunrise: data.Sunrise,
    Dhuhr: data.Dhuhr,
    Asr: data.Asr,
    Maghrib: data.Maghrib,
    Isha: data.Isha
  };
};

export const getCurrentPrayerName = (prayerTimes: PrayerTimes): string | undefined => {
  return Object.keys(prayerTimes).find(
    key => new Date() < new Date(prayerTimes[key])
  );
};

export const getCurrentTimeIn24HourFormat = (): string => {
  const currentTime = new Date();
  return currentTime.toTimeString().split(' ')[0];
};

export const fetchPrayerTimesForDay = (date: Date, lat: number, lon: number): Promise<PrayerTimes> => {
  const url = `${BASE_URL}/${date.getDate()}-${date.getMonth() + 1}-${date.getFullYear()}?latitude=${lat}&longitude=${lon}&method=2`;
  return axios.get(url)
    .then(res => transformPrayerTimes(res.data.data.timings));
};


export const getCurrentPrayerTime = (currentTime: Date, times: PrayerTimes): { name: string, className: string } => {
  const prayerTimes = [
    { name: 'Fajr', className: 'fajr' },
    { name: 'Sunrise', className: 'dawn' },

  ];
  for (let i = 1; i < prayerTimes.length; i++) {
    const checkingTime = new Date();
    if (prayerTimes[i].name === 'Late Night') {
      const [hours, minutes] = times['Fajr'].split(':');
      checkingTime.setHours(+hours - 1);
      checkingTime.setMinutes(+minutes);

Fajir is at 18 degrees, which is the wrong side
and then sunrise is -4 which seems to be inverted. How can i get what I expect
Fajr on the left at 198 and then the arc going to the right - so between 18 and -4 is 22 so the next "sunrize" should be at: 198-22 = 176 degrees I think, no?

> the specific angles for each day should be derived by finding the starting point fo the day at fajir and ending point of the day at isha and finding the proportion of that full angle that the current prayer takes
for instance fajir is at 9am and isha is at 10pm and the angles will always be 198 to -18 - so the total is 216 degrees. This means that if thuhur is at 12 and asr is at 4 that's 4 hours and 4/13 hours(9 am for fajir to 10pm for isha) means it'll be 4/13*216 degrees which is about 66 degrees in total. Does that make sense?

 doesn't seem to work, here's the function:


  
  export const mapTimeToAngle = (time, times) => {
    const start = parseTime(times.Fajr);
    const end = parseTime(times.Isha);
    const current = parseTime(time);

where does current-start come from?

  return (

      <Text x={position.x} y={position.y - 30} textAnchor="end">{text}</Text>
       {/* If anchor state is not used, you can hardcode the value */}
    </Svg>

export default Sun;

Should i make a new component? If so what should the code be inside and how should i update the other files?

## 📝 D3.js Islamic Prayer Arcs
**Date**: 2023-07-28 | **Source**: chatgpt

> I would like to build an HTML webpage that uses D3.js and fetches Islamic prayer times data from the AlAdhan API for Lille, France. The design should be modern, minimalist, blocky, and designer-styled, using a sans-serif font.

The page should feature a centered horizon line with a small blue circle representing Earth. Above this, create a large arc covering 216 degrees from -18 to 198 degrees in Cartesian coordinates. This arc represents the time from the start of Fajir prayer (astronomical twilight) to the end of Isha prayer.

Each prayer time (Fajir, Sunrise, Thuhur, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) will be represented on the arc, their positions calculated based on the total hours from Fajir to Isha. Each section of the arc should be colored according to the sky's color at that prayer time, transitioning from the color of one prayer time to the next.

Please note that Thuhur is at high noon when the sun is at its zenith, not at 12 PM. Sunrise represents the end of Fajir prayer time. Each prayer time begins at the specified time and ends just before the next prayer time begins.

Mark the boundary of each prayer time with a dot. A hover effect over each dot should display the prayer name and a short description of the astronomical calculation for that prayer time.

If the API fails, use the following times as fallback:

Fajr: 4:34 AM
Sunrise: 6:09 AM
Duhr: 1:54 PM
Asr: 6:06 PM
Maghrib: 9:41 PM
Isha: 11:16 PM
Finally, the visualization should automatically update at midnight to reflect the new day's prayer times.

This is the html, give me just the js file:

Use      D3's   const arc = d3.arc()

Draw the horizon line on the bottom and center it. Draw a blue ball representing the earth on the bottom centered and use         const arc = d3.arc()
 to draw the arcs around it

> For calculateArcDegrees let's do some math and walk through step by step and then make the function, we have 180+18+18=216 Degrees in total for all the prayers from nautical sunrise(fajir to nautical sunset(isha), once you figure out the total number of hours between isha and fajir you should be able to figure out where each prayer lands on that 216 degree curve, walk me through your logic adn then write the function

> let's do some math and walk through step by step and then make the function, we have 180+18+18=216 Degrees in total for all the prayers from nautical sunrise(fajir to nautical sunset(isha), once you figure out the total number of hours between isha and fajir you should be able to figure out where each prayer lands on that 216 degree curve, walk me through your logic and then update the following function

function timeToRadians(time, fajrTime, ishaTime) {
    const timeMoment = moment(time, 'HH:mm');
    const fajrMoment = moment(fajrTime, 'HH:mm');
    const ishaMoment = moment(ishaTime, 'HH:mm');

    if (timeMoment.isBefore(fajrMoment)) {
        timeMoment.add(1, 'day'); // if the time is before Fajr (i.e., after midnight), consider it as next day
    }

    const totalMinutes = ishaMoment.add(1, 'day').diff(fajrMoment, 'minutes'); // consider Isha as next day
    const minutesFromFajr = timeMoment.diff(fajrMoment, 'minutes');

    const degreesFromFajr = minutesFromFajr / totalMinutes * 216; // map onto a 0 to 216 degrees range
    const degrees = degreesFromFajr - 18; // shift the range to -18 to 198 degrees

    const radians = degrees / 180 * Math.PI; // convert degrees to radians
    return radians; // 0 radians is at the right
}

> ok i want a dark line representing night time  by drawing a connecting arc from isha back to fajir in the original day. We don't need to use the prayer times because it will always be from from -18 back to -162 degrees. The new "prayer" time will be called "Late Night" and will be inky black.

## 📝 Islamic Prayer Arcs.
**Date**: 2023-07-28 | **Source**: chatgpt

> i want a Javscript webpage that draws an arc across that starts from about -18 degrees below near the 8pm range to start for the islamic prayer of Fajir on the left hand side and a different color representing each prayer as it goes through a circle and all the prayers and ends at about 4pm or -18 on the right hand side. There should be an arc underneath from isha (around -18 under the right horizon or around 4pm on a clock) back to the original fajir(around -18 under the left horizon or around 8pm on a clock) The length of each arc in between should relate to the number of hours for that prayer. So if there is 10 hours from fajir to isha, and from fajir to sunrize there is 2 hours, there should be 2/10th of the arch colored between fajir and isha, place a dot at the boundaries between prayers. Time will have to move differently, we are drawing a full circle. At the top part between fajir and isha time will move at a certain speed, then on the bottom from  -18 below the horizon on the right (near isha) or about 4pm to -18 below the horizon on the left or about 8pm (near fajir) because the time between isha and fajir the next day is often quite short. Ask any clarifying questions, then tell me the best way to make a simple javascript and html one page website that can do this, and then once it's clear write the code.

> It's not rotated appropriately, the arc should: -18 degrees below the horizon on the left hand side near the 8pm range to start for the islamic prayer of Fajir on the left hand side and a different color representing each prayer as it goes through a circle and all the prayers and ends at about 4pm or -18 on the right hand side. There should be an arc underneath from isha (around -18 under the right horizon or around 4pm on a clock) back to the original fajir(around -18 under the left horizon or around 8pm on a clock) add the prayer time labels

> prayer times are off, the dots are a bit random. Think through step by step, why is fajir in the wrong location. It could be due to coordinate system mismatch. Remember our goal:

Center the whole thing on the page

---

> I want you to summarize the code project and don't write any code. After the summarization ask me clarifying questions until you understand perfectly the task, then give me a vanilla javascript / HTML webpage using d3 and pulling prayer times with this function call of an API:
function fetchPrayerTimesForDay(date) {
    return fetch(`http://api.aladhan.com/v1/timings/${date.getDate()}-${date.getMonth()+1}-${date.getFullYear()}?latitude=${lat}&longitude=${lon}&method=2`)
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(data => data.data.timings);
}
Think through step by step, consider the different coordinate systems between d3 and svgs 
Remember our goal:
Draw a horizon line across the bottom middle of the page and place a small blue circle on the center representing the earth. Center the whole thing on the page, make it artsy and bold and iconic. Get the prayer times from the api on aladhan.com for the current date in lille france. Then draw a larger arc that starts from about 198 degrees cartesian coordinates near the 8pm as if on a clock range to start for the islamic prayer of Fajir on the left hand side. The arc should end with the last prayer at -18 degrees cartesian, about 4pm on a clock face) on the right hand side for isha prayer.  Color the different sections of the arc representing each prayer as it goes through a circle, the color should represent the color of the sky at that time. It should draw all prayers between Fajir and Isha from 198 degrees cartesian and going clockwise and then ending beyond 0 cartesian at -18 degrees cartesian for isha. The length of each arc in between should relate to the number of hours for that prayer. So if there is 10 hours from fajir to isha, and from fajir to sunrize there is 2 hours, there should be 2/10th of the arch colored between fajir and isha, place a dot at the boundaries between prayers and the name of the prayer. 

Also don't write code till you clarify with me and have me approve your understanding

---

> 1. colors for the arc and the entire background which should be a gradient representing the previous prayer on the bottom and the next prayer color on the right.
2. fajir (sunrise - it' s not a prayer, but it's important for it to show), thuhur, asr, maghrib, isha. Fajir starts at astronomical twighlight just below the horizon on the left, and isha starts at astronomical twilight just 18degrees below the horizon on the right. THuhur is at high noon so when the sun is pointed directly upward. The rest you can figure out from the athan app and adding hours from fajir. If you have 180+18+18=216 Degrees in total for all the prayers, once you figure out the total number of hours between isha and fajir you should be able to figure out where each prayer lands on that 216 degree curve
3. fallback should be just to use these times for today:
Friday, July 28, 2023
Prayer	Time
Fajr	4:34 AM
Sunrise	6:09 AM
Duhr	1:54 PM
Asr	6:06 PM
Maghrib	9:41 PM
Isha	11:16 PM
4. Once the next prayer "comes in" it's that prayer time. So if asr prayer is 5:30 pm, it's thuhur prayer time until 5:29 and then asr comes in immediately when it becomes 5:30 
5. hover over on the dot should display the name of that prayer. and make a box that gives a short description of the astronimical calculation for that prayer.
6. make it modern, minimalist, blocky, sans serif font, designery
7. yes

---

> Please write the code, remember Set up the basic HTML structure: This would include a main container for the visualization and elements for displaying the API response status, any errors, and fallback data.

Fetch the prayer times: Create a method within a class or standalone function to fetch prayer times from the AlAdhan API, and handle any errors that might occur during the process.

Parse and format the data: After fetching the prayer times, create a function to transform the data into a format that is easy to work with for your visualization. This function should calculate the length of each prayer time segment and convert the times into the corresponding degrees on the circle.

Create the visualization: With your data ready, use D3 to create the visualization. This would involve creating a main svg container, drawing the arc for each prayer time, and filling each section with the appropriate color.

Handle interactivity: Add event listeners for the hover effect on each prayer time segment. When a user hovers over a segment, display the name of the prayer and the astronomical calculation for that prayer time.

Update the visualization: Finally, create a function that runs at midnight each day to fetch the new prayer times and update the visualization accordingly.

Remember to separate your concerns: keep your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files or distinct sections of your code, and comment your code to explain the purpose of each section and function. Write small, single-purpose functions and aim for clear, readable code rather than trying to make it overly concise. Be consistent with your naming conventions and file structure, and handle any potential errors to make your application robust and maintainable.

> remember to add Sunrise because that's when Fajir prayertime ends and that thuhur isn't noon/12pm it's high noon when the sun is directly overhead at its zenith.

## 📝 React Native Prayer Chart
**Date**: 2023-07-28 | **Source**: chatgpt

> fetches Islamic prayer times data from the AlAdhan API for Lille, France. The design should be modern, minimalist, blocky, and designer-styled, using a sans-serif font. 

Draw the horizon line on the bottom and center it. Draw a blue ball representing the earth on the bottom centered and use  const arc = d3.arc() for the arcs
to draw the arcs around it

The page should feature a centered horizon line with a small blue circle representing Earth. Above this, create a large arc covering 216 degrees from -18 to 198 degrees in Cartesian coordinates. This arc represents the time from the start of Fajir prayer (astronomical twilight) to the end of Isha prayer.

Each prayer time (Fajir, Sunrise, Thuhur, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) will be represented on the arc, their positions calculated based on the total hours from Fajir to Isha. Each section of the arc should be colored according to the sky's color at that prayer time, transitioning from the color of one prayer time to the next.

Please note that Thuhur is at high noon when the sun is at its zenith, not at 12 PM. Sunrise represents the end of Fajir prayer time. Each prayer time begins at the specified time and ends just before the next prayer time begins.

Mark the boundary of each prayer time with a dot. A hover effect over each dot should display the prayer name and a short description of the astronomical calculation for that prayer time.

## 📝 Modern Prayer Times Visualization for Lille
**Date**: 2023-07-28 | **Source**: claude

> I would like to build an HTML webpage that uses D3.js and fetches Islamic prayer times data from the AlAdhan API for Lille, France. The design should be modern, minimalist, blocky, and designer-styled, using a sans-serif font.

The page should feature a centered horizon line with a small blue circle representing Earth. Above this, create a large arc covering 216 degrees from -18 to 198 degrees in Cartesian coordinates. This arc represents the time from the start of Fajir prayer (astronomical twilight) to the end of Isha prayer.

Each prayer time (Fajir, Sunrise, Thuhur, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) will be represented on the arc, their positions calculated based on the total hours from Fajir to Isha. Each section of the arc should be colored according to the sky's color at that prayer time, transitioning from the color of one prayer time to the next.

Please note that Thuhur is at high noon when the sun is at its zenith, not at 12 PM. Sunrise represents the end of Fajir prayer time. Each prayer time begins at the specified time and ends just before the next prayer time begins.

Mark the boundary of each prayer time with a dot. A hover effect over each dot should display the prayer name and a short description of the astronomical calculation for that prayer time.

If the API fails, use the following times as fallback:

Fajr: 4:34 AM

Sunrise: 6:09 AM

Duhr: 1:54 PM

Asr: 6:06 PM

Maghrib: 9:41 PM

Isha: 11:16 PM

Finally, the visualization should automatically update at midnight to reflect the new day's prayer times.

Sure, I can add a connecting arc from -18 back to -162 degrees. Here is the code:

function drawSunPath(prayerTimes) { const segments = \[ { start: prayerTimes.Fajr, end: prayerTimes.Sunrise, color: 'pink', offset: -18 }, { start: prayerTimes.Sunrise, end: prayerTimes.Dhuhr, color: 'lightblue', offset: 0 }, { start: prayerTimes.Dhuhr, end: prayerTimes.Asr, color: 'yellow', offset: 0 }, { start: prayerTimes.Asr, end: prayerTimes.Maghrib, color: 'orange', offset: 0 }, { start: prayerTimes.Maghrib, end: prayerTimes.Isha, color: 'purple', offset: 0 }, { start: prayerTimes.Isha, end: "40 degrees below horizon", color: 'darkblue', offset: 18 }, { start: "40 degrees below horizon", end: -162, color: 'darkblue', offset: 18 }, { start: -162, end: -18, color: 'darkblue', offset: -18 } \]; const line = d3.line().x(d => -d.x).y(d => d.y);

    segments.forEach(segment => {
        const startAngle = mapTimeToAngle(segment.start, prayerTimes);
    
        let endAngle;
    
        // Special case for when the sun is 40 degrees below the horizon
        if (segment.end === "40 degrees below horizon") {
            const ishaTime = parseTime(prayerTimes.Isha);
            // Add 2 hours and 40 minutes to the Isha time
            ishaTime.setHours(ishaTime.getHours() + 2, ishaTime.getMinutes() + 40);
            endAngle = mapTimeToAngle(ishaTime, prayerTimes);
        } else {
            endAngle = mapTimeToAngle(segment.end, prayerTimes);
        }
        console.log(startAngle, endAngle);
        // Start at the offset angle, and decrease the angle (for clockwise direction)
        const points = d3.range(startAngle, endAngle, -0.1).map(angle => {
            const radians = angle * Math.PI / 180;
            return { x: radius * Math.cos(radians), y: radius * Math.sin(radians) };
        });
        svg.append('path').attr('d', line(points)).attr('stroke', segment.color).attr('stroke-width', 2).attr('fill', 'none');
    });
    
    const timePoints = ['Fajr', 'Sunrise', 'Dhuhr', 'Asr', 'Maghrib', 'Isha', 'Late Night'];
    
    timePoints.forEach(prayerName => {
        const angle = mapTimeToAngle(prayerTimes[prayerName], prayerTimes);
        const radians = angle * Math.PI / 180;
        const x = -radius * Math.cos(radians);
        const y = radius * Math.sin(radians);
        const textAnchor = ["Dhuhr", "Asr", "Maghrib"].includes(prayerName) ? "start" : "end";
        const textX = ["Dhuhr", "Asr", "Maghrib"].includes(prayerName) ? x - 10 : x + 10;
        const textY = y < 0 ? y - 10 : y + 10;
        svg.append('text').attr('class', 'timeText').attr('x', textX).attr('y', textY).attr('text-anchor', textAnchor).text(prayerName + ' ' + prayerTimes[prayerName]);
    });
    

}

This code will add a connecting arc from -18 back to -162 degrees. The new prayer time will be called "Late Night".

## 📝 GNG - Invitation Accepted!
**Date**: 2023-07-27 | **Source**: chatgpt

> Fix the grammar and keep the crazy enthusiasm:
What a beautiful invitation to receive. I am honored to be invited and remember that moment, pre-so-many-things back in 2018, and the sense of the sacred that being with such heart-full people in such a beautiful location unviels. Come end of October, insha'allah, I will be a first time father. Josephine has given me her blessings to attend without her, although my initial instinct was to see if it was possible to bring my niece to babysit and make a family trip out of it! Josephine said that I might be getting a bit carried away. I'm not exactly sure how to do this dad thing, any parents on this thread know if it's ridiculous to bring a 2 month old on a trip like this?
In any case, I'm definitely interested and if you're of the praying sort, let's pray for some new grants before Jan. Otherwise I might have to raise my hand for those flight tickets. +BG

> -18 is degrees below the horizon that counts as when fajir comes in on the left and -18 is the same for when isha prayer is on the right 

 2 because asr maghrib and isha had overlapping text - open for a better solution  than just moving them so they don't overlap outside the blue circle "sky"

3. the sun indicator matches the sun in real life. When it is at the zenith in the app it is at the zenith in real life, sunset there sunset here, etc

4. a longer day will have more chunks of the arc which represents every second of the day 86400 - so the full circle has 86400 seconds for the sun to move once each second. i'd like the gradients to also change smoothly once each second. the total length of the circle should be correlated to 86400 so the sun falls at the right second of the day. For instance if the circumference is 4400pixels in total length the sun would move about .0509 pixels every second and would move only once every 19 seconds because 19*.0509 is about 1pixel
5 yeah let's make it so the gradient moves smoothly once each second

Showing that it seems to be adding one second to the prayer time for each prayer, that doesn't make sense. It should only get the prayer time once each session and only update the current time

> Critique this code and I have an idea
Start the circle  with fajir at at 198 degrees (-18 below the horizon on the left) with fajir, and then draw line segments by minute based on the time between each prayer. We don't need the final time "fajir day 2" instead we can say draw an arc after isha back to 198 degrees. Makes sense? let's rewrite the code with this in mind  

// Define the sky and its dimensions
const sky = document.getElementById('sky');
const width = sky.offsetWidth;
const height = sky.offsetHeight;

// Define the default location (Lille)
let lat = 50.6292;
let lon = 3.0573;

// Get today's date
const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];

// Create the SVG container
const svg = d3.select('#sky').append('svg')
    .attr('width', width)
    .attr('height', height)
    .append('g')
    .attr('transform', `translate(${width / 2}, ${height / 2})`);

// Create the earth circle
const earth = svg.append('circle')
    .attr('id', 'earth')
    .attr('r', 40)
    .attr('cx', 0)
    .attr('cy', 0);

// Create the horizon line
const horizon = svg.append('line')
    .attr('id', 'horizon')
    .attr('x1', -width / 2)
    .attr('y1', 0)
    .attr('x2', width / 2)
    .attr('y2', 0);

// Create the sun circle// Create the sun circle
const sun = svg.append('circle')
    .attr('id', 'sun')
    .attr('r', 20)
    .attr('cx', 0)
    .attr('cy', 0)
    .attr('fill', 'yellow')
    .attr('stroke', 'orange')
    .attr('stroke-width', 3);

// Create the sun text
const sunText = svg.append('text')
    .attr('id', 'sunText')
    .attr('x', 0)
    .attr('y', -30)
    .text('');


// Create the sun text

 can you rotate the drawsunpath so fajir starts at -18 degrees, the idea of when the sun rises it's just 18 degrees below the horizon. In Degrees its probably 198 degrees. Also the path should go "in reverse" to how the angle grows normally around a circle so that it flows from left to right

## 📝 Prayer Times Visualization App
**Date**: 2023-07-26 | **Source**: chatgpt

> you are a professional modern javascript web developer. convert this app description to a single page javascript app: 
Title: Prayer Times Visualizer

Description:

We are looking to develop a web application to visually represent Muslim prayer times over the course of a day. The application will represent Earth as a central circle, with a sun moving along a circular path around it.

The sun's position should correspond to the time of day, and it should move to visualize the transitions between different prayer times. The prayer times are based on different positions of the sun, and the app should visually emphasize these transitions by altering the sun's path color and the background color accordingly.

Background: The background color should smoothly transition between various colors corresponding to different times of the day:

Midnight to Fajr (pre-dawn): Dark Blue
Fajr to Sunrise: Light Blue
Sunrise to Dhuhr (midday): Yellow
Dhuhr to Asr (afternoon): Orange
Asr to Maghrib (sunset): Red
Maghrib to Isha (evening): Dark Blue
Isha to Midnight: Black
Sun Path: The sun should move along a dotted line that represents its path around the Earth. Each segment of the sun's path will correspond to the prayer times and should be colored as per the time of day, consistent with the background.

Sun Position: The sun's position along the path will indicate the current time. At the start of the day, the sun should be positioned at the Fajr position on the left, and it should move right across the circle, setting at the Maghrib position.

Interactivity: Include buttons to "Simulate a Day" which starts the sun at the Fajr position and moves it across the sky to Maghrib over the course of 60 seconds. Also, include buttons to "Stop Simulation" and "End Simulation" which stop the simulation and return the sun to the current real-world time, respectively.

Ask any clarifying questions first and then give me an entire file to copy/paste into a .html file

For some reason the prayer time  are all over the circle arc and the arc segments are not colored 
it's just a black circle
fajir should be -18 degrees below the horizon to the left and isha -18 degrees below the horizon on the right 
and let's do these improvements so we don't make mistakes:

Use more semantic variable names like sunriseRadians instead of just angle
Extract out helper functions like getSunPosition to make the code more modular
and 
  const sunriseRadians = mapTimeToRadians(times.sunrise, times)  etc

---

> can we make the improvements and fix things by splitting functions into all these helper functions:
// Helper functions

function getPrayerTimesForDay(date) {
  // Fetch prayer times for given date 
}

function getPrayerDayBoundaries(times) {
  // Calculate fajr to fajr time boundaries
} 

function mapTimeToRadians(time, times) {
  // Map time string to radians along arc
}

function getSunPosition(radians) {
  // Calculate x, y coords for sun position  
}

// Main logic

function update(date) {

  const times = getPrayerTimesForDay(date);
  
  const {start, end} = getPrayerDayBoundaries(times);  

  const currentTime = // get current time

  // Calculate sun position
  const sunriseRadians = mapTimeToRadians(times.sunrise, times)  
  const {x, y} = getSunPosition(sunriseRadians)

  // Update visualization
  sun.attr('cx', x)  
  // etc

}

update the background color, make the bigger circle empty on the inside and have a fat stroke dots arc with each section of the arc colored by the prayer time. at the end of the section label it with a floating prayer name in a padded text box translucent with white so it's legible. add a gradient background depending on the prayer/time of day so in the dawn goes from bottom being dark rosey to lighter rose to white by the time it becomes thuhur mid day it should be yellow white shifting to yellow white and then yellow for asr then orange and orange red for maghrib and then darker midnight blue and purple as it goes to isha and then darker blue purple night at the opposite zenith at the darkest night all as gradients shifting from one color to the next and have the sun follow the path of the larger circle with thick dots. starts on the right for fajir and then moves one second at a time to the right, so the larger circle is 86400 seconds long and each segment is colored and is mirrored in the sky

Give me the entire code back. the gradients don't seem to be working - make it centered and responsive. Do a complete refactor and commenting after critiquing the code

> There's a blue background circle that's not needed, be sure to color the whole background with the add a gradient background depending on the prayer/time of day so in the dawn goes from bottom being dark rosey to lighter rose to white by the time it becomes thuhur mid day it should be yellow white shifting to yellow white and then yellow for asr then orange and orange red for maghrib and then darker midnight blue and purple as it goes to isha and then darker blue purple night at the opposite zenith at the darkest night all as gradients shifting from one color to the next  

Fajir is on the right - it should be on the left, thuhur is on the left it should be straight up. and isha is overlapping with fajir on the right when it should be below the horizon line. Reassess your calculation of the horizon line and the prayer arcs- maybe do the prayer arcs first and then draw a horizon line from fajir to maghrib. That might make it easir to do.

> Ok well there are some issues: I want to add another larger circle around the earth circle and place the sun on it. The larger circle should represent the suns path around the earth. The circle should be transparent gray dotted line. The sun should be dark yellow not red. The suns placement above the horizon line should be determined by how many "sunlight" hours there are in the day. So the ratio of the number ofhours between fajir and maghrib (sunrise and sunset) and 24 hours. How should we move the sun around the earth to visualize this appropriately. It's related to the lat/long. at the equator it would be 12 hours dark and light so the horizon line can be exactly in the middle of the earth circle and fajir would be just to the left and maghrib should be just to the right. The further north you get I think the horizon line (in the summer) should move down so there are more "daylight" hours where the sun is above the line. Think through this with me and write psudo code for how to visualize this well

## 📝 Prayer Times Visual Clock
**Date**: 2023-07-26 | **Source**: claude

> Can you make the project described in this text: The purpose of this code is to create an interactive web-based clock that shows the current time, the prayer times for the current day based on the user's location, and the motion of the sun across the sky over the course of the day.

**1\. Objective:**

The goal of the application is to accurately visualize the passage of time in a way that reflects the natural progression of a day, including the movement of the sun and changing sky colors corresponding to different times of day. This includes:

*   Visualizing the sun's movement across the sky, using a circle to represent the path.
    
*   Adjusting the position of the horizon line depending on the number of daylight hours in the day.
    
*   Showing the current prayer times.
    
*   Changing the background color of the sky according to the time of day.
    
*   Creating a clock face that represents a full 24-hour cycle.
    

**2\. Structure of the Code:**

The code is written in JavaScript and uses the p5.js library for drawing graphics and animations, and the SalahTimes API for fetching the prayer times.

2.1 **Setup function**:

This function is used to initialize the canvas and the elements to be drawn. It sets the size of the canvas, defines the drawing style for the sun, horizon line, and prayer times.

2.2 **FetchPrayerTimes function**:

This function is used to fetch the prayer times from the SalahTimes API. These prayer times are stored in a global object for use elsewhere in the program.

2.3 **Draw function**:

This is where the main visualization occurs. In p5.js, the draw function is called once per frame, creating an animation. It does the following things:

*   Clears the previous frame.
    
*   Draws the sky by changing the background color based on the current time of day.
    
*   Draws the sun at its current position.
    
*   Draws the prayer times.
    
*   Updates the sun's position.
    

2.4 **DrawPrayerTimes function**:

This function is used to display the prayer times at their corresponding positions on the outer circle. It calculates the position of each prayer time by converting the time into an angle, and then uses that angle to draw the prayer time on the outer circle.

**3\. Key Principles:**

3.1 **Sun's Position Calculation**:

The position of the sun is calculated based on the current time of day. The code divides the circumference of the circle into 86400 parts (the number of seconds in a day) and calculates the position of the sun for each second of the day.

3.2 **Horizon Line Adjustment**:

The horizon line's position is determined by the number of daylight hours in the day. The more daylight hours there are, the lower the horizon line is drawn.

3.3 **Prayer Times Display**:

The prayer times are fetched from the SalahTimes API and displayed at their corresponding positions on the outer circle. The position of each prayer time is calculated by converting the time into an angle and drawing it at that angle on the circle.

3.4 **Sky Color Changes**:

The sky's color is determined by the current time of day. The code defines several segments of the day, each with its own color. The background color is then set based on the current segment of the day.

**4\. Potential Improvements:**

4.1 **Error Handling**:

The code could benefit from more robust error handling. For instance, it currently doesn't handle the case when the SalahTimes API is unavailable or returns an error.

4.2 **User Interface Enhancements**:

More user interface enhancements could be made. For instance, it could include features like allowing users to enter their location manually, showing the current date, or adjusting the visualization based on the user's local sunrise and sunset times.

4.3 **Code Structure**:

The code structure could be improved by breaking down the larger functions into smaller ones, each with a single responsibility. This would make the code more readable and maintainable.

Overall, this is an interesting project that combines data from an API with graphics drawn using p5.js to create a visualization of the passage of time and prayer times. It's a good example of how programming can be used to create unique and interactive visualizations.

also There's a blue background circle that's not needed, be sure to color the whole background with the add a gradient background depending on the prayer/time of day so in the dawn goes from bottom being dark rosey to lighter rose to white by the time it becomes thuhur mid day it should be yellow white shifting to yellow white and then yellow for asr then orange and orange red for maghrib and then darker midnight blue and purple as it goes to isha and then darker blue purple night at the opposite zenith at the darkest night all as gradients shifting from one color to the next Fajir is on the right - it should be on the left, thuhur is on the left it should be straight up. and isha is overlapping with fajir on the right when it should be below the horizon line. Reassess your calculation of the horizon line and the prayer arcs- maybe do the prayer arcs first and then draw a horizon line from fajir to maghrib. That might make it easir to do.

Can you describe the code and understand why these issues arise and tell me what to do

> I don't want to place things by angle of when the prayer is, i want a circle that starts from about -18 near the 8pm range to start for Fajir on the left hand side and a circle that goes through all the prayers and ends at about 4pm or -18 on the right hand side. The length of each arc in between should relate to the start of fajir till the end of isha. And then on th ebottom side of the arc time should move at a different speed to go from -18 on the right or 4pm to -18 on the left or about 8pm because the time between isha and fajir the next day is often quite short. Do you see what I want, can you refactor this code to do that?

With the Covid outbreak and the subsequent economic crisis, and after the Beirut Blast, Lebanon has been experiencing unprecedented unemployment rates, and a serious economic crisis that is affecting everyone in the country. Poverty rates have been increasing exponentially in such highly populated areas and farmers and local producers have been suffering from high cost of inputs and limited sales due to transportation costs and limited consumer capacity.
Nature by Marc Beyrouthy since its establishment 7 years ago has been committed to helping the rural communities. During this time, NoGarlicNoOnions NGNO, with Anthony Rahayel, founder of Souk El Akel have been promoting Lebanese food and its culture. Together we organized MenKelLebnenLaKelLebnen to support MenKelLebnen initiative for Lebanon & Lebanese producers. This initiative buys vegetables, fruits, and Mouneh from remote areas, making sure to distribute them to families in need, hopefully on all the Lebanese territory.
In the beginning of 2020, Nature by Marc Beyrouthy and NGNO joined efforts in “La Campagne en Ville”, producer’s market which took place each month. The aim was to support the local producers, women cooperatives, and small artisans, by providing marketing support. 

we believe that “ALONE, WE CAN DO SO LITTLE;TOGETHER, WE CAN DO SO MUCH”"	"we are trying to create a safe and healthy atmosphere in which all members of the community can participate;as gathering places where families can bond with neighbors and visit with friends. 
A place where producers contribute to local food security and diversity. Creating a full support between local population and the producers. This place can also provide a medium by which people can get closer to their food sources. Many consumers feel good about supporting local producers. They also tend to distinguish the food offered at farmer’s markets as higher in quality, more flavorful, fresher, and healthier than the produce typically found in other outlets. 
We are also a space for exchange of ideas, workshops and sessions. Not to mention, how many national and international conferences and meetings are choosing this place of positivity to nurture their groups while they also access the products and the community."	Team building activities, learning experience, markets or festive gatherings have the perfect location within our hub. Our assets include experts in different fields are ready to support and assist the growth and blooming of our community. We also have a team of dedicated people committed to supporting small producers from local rural and surrounding communities while aiming to achieve an enhanced and sustainable livelihood. Our team includes social media, organization, customer service, etc.	.	2023-06-15 8:50:38 AM

## 📝 Prayer Circle in Paris
**Date**: 2023-07-25 | **Source**: chatgpt

> can you generate a javascript webpage code for the following natural language description? 
Goal: I want to see a circle going around inside a larger circle split into 5 segments which represent the different times of day for prayer.
Detailed description of how I would do it, first I would get the latitude and longitude, let's use Paris France for the location and jul 25, 2023 for the date. Next I would understand the islamic principals for the times of prayer, Fajir starts at dawn, Thur at high noon, etc. 
Finally I would create the prayer times, and then split up the 24 hours with that ratio. 
Finally I'd move the indicator circle (the smaller circle within the larger circle) at 1 radian per minute per day, then I would draw the lines to dissect the larger circle into five depending on how many radians(or minuets) it is between each prayer. 
Tell me first a natural language summary, then tell me in code how to do that.

---

> the red ball represents the sun right? so fajir is dawn, when the fajir prayer time is here it should be at the horizon on the left and the time should be displayed, thuhur is when the sun is overhead, asr is when your shadow is your length, maghrib is sun set so again the ball goes into the horizon and isha is when there is no light at all so when the sun is at a specific angle below the horizon. You should know the different angles, you have access to that right?

---

> great getting all the information, here is what i see on the page:
Location: Paris, France
Prayer Times: Fajr: 04:45, Sunrise: 06:15, Dhuhr: 13:57, Asr: 18:06, Sunset: 21:39, Maghrib: 21:39, Isha: 23:08, Imsak: 04:35, Midnight: 01:57, Firstthird: 00:31, Lastthird: 03:23
and a circle with a thin line and 1/4th of the red "sun" in th eupper left corner. THe sun should be near sunset right now, we need the current time and for the sun to be updated to that location

---

> add another button, end simulation go back to current time and update the sun to show current prayer time, make the text for the prayer time a little smaller. it's also incorrectly assuming that it's thuhur time it says the right current prayer time: Current Time: 20:10:56
 yet the sun is in the wrong position and it says it's thuhur

---

> Please review and assess the code according to best practices, walk through how it works step by step function by function and describe how the "sun" moves second by second and how it will know which section of the "sky" is the time for prayer. I really like the way it looks now with a big circle with the horizon being on the bottom of the screen with just enough on the bottom to display when the sun sets and when the "sky" above will become dark because the sun is too far below

---

> Can we change how the sun is in the sky based on the current time instead of getting current prayer time and figuring out the elapsed time since Fajir. And let's color the sky based on the sun. The sky is the "background" of the page. Dawn should be a rosy pink, sun straight up should be a white yellow, sunset should be a orange purple and isha should be a midnight blue. Text should go white when the sky is dark colored and black when its light colored.

> give me just the script now, before you do so explain how the dotted line represetnts the suns path across the earth and how each part will be colored for each prayer time and how the sun will be following it, explain how that now it's almost noon and where the sun should be on the path and then give me just the script code

> we have the api in our code, merge this psudocode with the code we have. First compare the two, critique it and explain how it will work. Do not give me the code yet till I ask for it, 
Once you figure it out, critique where things might go wrong and ask me clarifying 
questions. Then only when I ask send me the entire file

> As for issue 1. The speed should be fixed. Determine the length of the circle and then divide it into 86400 seconds which is the number of seconds in the day and move it one second at a time and each second should fall into one of the prayer times.
issue 2: daylight hour accuracy seems ok
issue 3 computers are good at knowing date and time
Resolve the issue and merge the code and give me the entire file

---

> i think it might be flipped upside down, also can you draw the earth as a blue ball in the center and bring back the sky chaning colors and putting the prayer time inside the sun - also can you see if the athan API gives you a degrees - perhaps we can use that to show where things are

---

> can you place the different prayer times along the outer circle? and color the path the sun follows according to the current time of day (just before fajir to fajir is dawn with a pink white orange clow, fajir to thuhur is early day is bright yellow white, then yellow, yellow to orange to red/purple for maghrib to isha midnight blue to dark midnight blue/black during the darkest hours

---

> that's not the path, you made a stroke on the sun, the path is the larger outside circle that's currently black. Also where did the horizon line go? and I only see one prayer time, the next one visible. Place all the prayer times around the circle at the appropriate location. Thuhur straight above, fajir and maghrib on the left and right respectively by the horizon line that makes a chord across the larger path circle the sun takes

---

> remember these points: Compute the number of daylight hours: The existing code does not compute the number of daylight hours. It assumes that daylight is from Fajr to Maghrib, which is not necessarily the case throughout the year due to seasonal changes.

Adjust the horizon line: In the existing code, the horizon line is fixed. According to your pseudocode, we need to adjust the horizon line based on the number of daylight hours. The higher the number of daylight hours, the lower the horizon line should be and vice versa.

Move the sun considering Fajr as the starting point: The existing code starts the sun at the rightmost point of the sun path, which does not correspond to the Fajr prayer time. The pseudocode takes into account the Fajr prayer time as the starting point of the sun.

Fajir is on the right - it should be on the left, thuhur is on the left it should be straight up. and isha is overlapping with fajir on the right when it should be below the horizon line. walk through step by step your calculation of the horizon line and the prayer arcs. A solution may be to do the prayer arcs first and then draw a horizon line from fajir to maghrib. That might make it easir to do. 

Fajir should be about 18 degrees below the horizon line on the left from the center of the point of the circle and isha should be about 18 degrees below the horizon line on the right from the center of the point of the circle

> nice, ok, now let's work on the styling! There's a blue background circle that's not needed, that should be the entire background - lets remove it. Lets color the whole background with the add a gradient background depending on the prayer/time of day so in the dawn goes from bottom being dark pink to lighter rose from bottom of the page to top as a gradient and then as it goes to thuhur it goes from lighter rose to light whiteish yellow for thuhur and then from thuhur to asr it goes from whiteish yellow to saturated yellow for asr than as it approaches maghrib it should go from saturated yellow to orange and then red for maghrib and then darker midnight blue from maghrib to isha and then from isha to late night it goes from midnight blue to dark purple at the mid point between isha and fajir and then as it approaches fajir it goes from dark purple to light pink as a gradient

> right now the prayer name by the time by the sun says "undefined" can you also make the all the text have a light padding and a light gray translucent background so you can read the time and different z indexes so that when the sun passes it has a higher z index so you can read when the text overlaps at least the one forthe sun's prayer time?

> I don't want to place things by angle of when the prayer is, i want a circle that starts from about -18 near the 8pm range to start for Fajir on the left hand side and a circle that goes through all the prayers and ends at about 4pm or -18 on the right hand side. The length of each arc in between should relate to the start of fajir till the end of isha. And then on th ebottom side of the arc time should move at a different speed to go from -18 on the right or 4pm to -18 on the left or about 8pm because the time between isha and fajir the next day is often quite short. Do you see what I want, can you refactor this code to do that?

There was a big shift for me when I finally opened up to you and did… 2019-06-23 17:02:26 EThere was a big shift for me when I finally opened up to you and did my best to share as much as I /could/: what I remembered when I remembered. I understand hearing several things at different times was a lot to handle&c;a& and scary. It made you wonder how much more there was to reveal&c;a& if it would ever end.

I can't change the past&c;a& my mistakes&c;a& nor how I shared&c;a& when and how much. I can assure you that the shift was real though.

The night I broke down and felt like I was dying&c;a& dreaming of you handing me a razor blade was absolutely terrifying. I can't prove to you the fact that it changed me profoundly. I can simply say it. It broke me open for the best&c;a& as in: being really and completely honest&c;a& facing my darkness&c;a& choosing what to do with that&c;a& and setting my intentions for the rest of my life.

Eventually I chose to forgive myself and understand what led me to do such disgusting things. All our discussions helped me a lot to draw and understand a clear picture of the large context in which these mistakes took place.

I know you're never done growing&c;a& learning and refining. I also know this time was a stepping stone.

Part of me is proud of where I stand today&c;a& for not killing nor hating myself&c;a& but being able to forgive and love better.

All of me is deeply sad and disappointed for hurting you so badly.

Despite all this&c;a& I chose with my whole heart to want to be in a relationship with you&c;a& this time knowing much more precisely what I can/cannot handle&c;a& what I need&c;a& and what I want to build together.

Despite time being rather short between the revelation and the proposal&c;a& I thought this was a good way to get a feel for how you want to move forward. I felt comfortable with asking - I actually felt at peace and inspired.

I know for a fact that being chosen wholeheartedly is crucial to me. I know I will lose interest in our relationship by being tolerated rather than loved and cared for.

In the very beginning&c;a& the new me would have left or spoke up. I am choosing to accept the last five years for what they are: unsuccessful attempts at loving.

When you create something&c;a& you go through iterations&c;a& you throw away the first attempts (or keep it on the shelf because you actually care about seeing the work in progress!) and eventually come closer to the ideal you have.

I think our ideals were not aligned. Are they today?

Can we craft together with the same/a similar definition of what beauty and love are?

First and foremost: how engaged are we today?

——————————————————————-

It’s not just how/when you unfolded things&c;a& I am surprised that you knew how hurt I was from the time with Chris

How hard it hit me

I don’t think anything besides my nervous breakdown last summer about the hundreds of thousands of dead people in Iraq has ever hit me that hard. Kind of selfish I guess

Anyway&c;a& it hurts.

And what sometimes comes into my mind is - she saw me like that&c;a& and did things //again// after that. Many times. I know you were different then&c;a& and the first time (that you told me) probably was some sort of special situation. And knowing that and knowing that it happened again within a year&c;a& just does not compute for me.

I understand your transformation probably feels real to you. I also know that change is hard. And people don’t really change a whole lot&c;a& not after a certain age. It’s possible&c;a& lots of people have transformations when they convert or leave their homes&c;a& and I see myself at least when I watch myself&c;a& I’m a goofy creative person and I fall back to that always.

It’s interesting&c;a& you’re giving me what you want most&c;a& to be in a relationship with me. In terms of revelations and moving forward&c;a& I wanted to be engaged and live together (closer) for a year before getting married because I knew my feelings take about a year after each previous revelation to come to some sort of steady state. I guess we’re halfway through this time&c;a& although it’s not getting calmer&c;a& I’m feeling more and more upset. I’m feeling betrayed in a way that something I desperately wanted&c;a& to feel deeply in love and to be able to articulate it honestly&c;a& each time is taken away from me&c;a& and it makes me feel quite angry&c;a& surprised&c;a& and helpless. It’s what I want too&c;a& to be honestly able to say loving things&c;a& and love you&c;a& and hold you and be happy and it takes me a long time to let go of fear (first time) let go of disgust (second time) and now my anger and disgust and fear is feeling less hot and doesn’t shake me. It just feels pointless. In my mind I can hear things like&c;a& she can do whatever she wants&c;a& I don’t care. I am feeling apathetic&c;a& rather than hurt&c;a& unless I thin about it or talk about it then I’m surprised and angry again&c;a& more surprised by the fact that I haven’t left and angry that my rare moments of honest expression of love were stolen from me.

This is what’s happening now for me and I said yes to the proposal because I wanted to move forward and ease in after the second series of revelations that happened in Beirut. And then the third the day before felt like a trap&c;a& because there was no turning back.

It doesn’t seem to bode well for our marriage. What a start&c;a& huh?

I wonder what it would be like&c;a& or if it’s possible to break the rock crusted anger and surprise and resentment I feel and get to the core of the living parts again. At least when the lava was flowing I could see I also cared. Now I just want to cry at my loss. I’m not closing the door to forgiving you and not feeling upset towards you&c;a& it is a bit mixed up when you want me to do things to help you feel safer in life and in the relationship and I feel trapped in this position&c;a& and one day I can feeling no hard feelings between us. Is it possible for me to get to the point of loving again? Well&c;a& I know empathy is required&c;a& and each time I was so sorry for how things were going and the hurt you must have felt and I remember being able to understand and temper my hurt by understanding you. As hurt as I was I also cared. I’m not sure why that empathy is so much harder to feel. Maybe because the last revelation was earlier? Before I had a chance to hurt you so it was random? Perhaps because they kept coming&c;a& and the last one was sort of like a trap. Perhaps because now it just doesn’t even seem comparable anymore and I gave you enough excuses. I don’t know I’m trying to understand right now while writing…. I’m not attempting to be mean&c;a& and I don’t mean to come off as hopeless&c;a& I’m just opening up my mind to see what I don’t let myself sometimes even say to myself so perhaps we can find a way forward.

I think I had no idea that I wanted to be chosen (openly so&c;a& clearly) and that my partner wouldn't have romantic/deep/time consuming relationships with other women.

Also didn't think it was that important for my partner to commit clearly&c;a& to know what he wants&c;a& and to act on it with no hesitation.

I knew a feeling of settling was and is important to me&c;a& and that was lacking from the start in all aspects of our relationship. I was aware of that&c;a& and I didn't know if/when you'd want to be more settled. Hence: the marriage proposal as an opportunity to really find out.

What made you say "you're giving me what you want most: to be in a relationship with me"?

Let me correct something: What I want most (in terms of relationships) is to be with someone who dedicates him/herself to being loving and caring. To be there no matter what.

This is what I am trying to give you&c;a& and it doesn't feel like you want it - makes sense&c;a& today.

I think I could have set my Sway profile as "only looking for long term exclusive relationships"&c;a& had I known that's what I wanted. As you say: I am surprised I didn't leave. I care about you too&c;a& but that's not what made me stay: I can recognize now I was simply too scared to leave. I had found something exciting and meaningful&c;a& even if it was painful. The thrill was worth it apparently.

Do you really think I wanted to be a mean person? I know you are not&c;a& I think no one really wants to be mean&c;a& except rare occasions maybe&c;a& but that's not us. I hurt you because I was hurt&c;a& with no intention to hurt you. The only time I hurt you intentionally was in Berlin&c;a& after spending time with Lisa and we were in that hotel room at night. I felt so disrespected and hurt I remember hitting your leg. I was very angry&c;a& and immediately regretted.

I am not evil. I care for you&c;a& and I am damn clumsy. I have a hard time being articulate and understanding my needs and emotions. And I am also brave and willing to make things nice no matter what it takes&c;a& as long as there is respect. Maybe we're simply too different&c;a& incompatible in terms of what we need and have to offer. Maybe timing was off all along.

dual background - the waste studio 2019-04-26 14:24:40 Rdual background - the waste studio

Consultancy in geology and environmental science

Industrial 4500 licensed companies

Developed industrial sectors - paper&c;a& food/beverage

Chemical industries&c;a& Pharma

Food> impact in industrial output

Effluent being dropped without feeling pressure of legislation

Problem of enforcement of legislation

Industry does not pollute

Industrialist pollutes because he stops the process before it’s completely rehabilitated to save money

Consumers have a huge roll very soon

Everyone’s connected to everyone VIA social media

Preparing a platform to know about polluting industrialists to boycott their products

Does your favorite lebnah come from the factory that dumps WHEY in the litanyeh river?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litani\_River

What drives industries is environmental law and regulation of environmental law and ENFORCEMENT

Law: Environmental compliance law Class 1->3 industries need to carry out environmental audits and an environmental compliance plan with a deadline for compliance

First three classes are classified as most polluting

They should not be making as much profits as they are if they are incorporating the costs of environmental damage

Unfair advantage globally -> countries which don’t care for the environment they will not add that cost

\-Awareness will help because we can understand the total costs

Cumulative effect of pollution - if you want to sustain an industry

You can dump a few tons of waste for a while

Poluters who have been sued by the Litany river authority

Dumping whey into the river

Rich in protein

We can make whey powder - one of the essential ingredients of ice cream

ice cream manufactures:

They’re importing whey powder

And carob beans

We dump the whey powder and the carob beans without taking advantage of making ice cream

Industry and organic agriculture - most promising way to create jobs 5-10 year plans jobs to create - new economic activities we can generate

Policy and enforce it - or make it appealing to the businesses?

Demonstrating the industrial company can be both win win - show that it works for both environment and industrial companies

UNDOUGH - funded by EU - regional project sustainable consumption / production. How does a consumer identify which products find sustainable products VS

Circular economy

Integrated pollution prevention and control

Half a billion dollars sitting in the central bank for industries and cleaning industries

500&c;a&00&c;a&000$ dollars 2% rate

Banks are calling and asking if you have things coming up in the pipeline to build

Competitiveness of green products

You can pollute and save money

And your products will be more expensive

The gap between 4&c;a&000 and 5&c;a&000 LL -> is the cost difference between a “environmentally friendly” and non environmentally friendly product

TINY bit more expensive product that does a lot of good

We can comply with environmental standards - ant not at a high cost

By helping companies preventing pollution at source - 6 months

No&c;a& we’re not an NGO - we’re a responsible business

And the companies weren’t willing to sell them the waste banners

After two years and they came back to them&c;a& to take their banners and make products for the company as a part of their CSR program.

Awareness and legislation -

Some industries have toxic byproducts

You’re not supposed to be that much money because people and the environment will be impacted

Waste studio - part of our DNA - and we don’t promote ourself as

Being responsible is a part of our mission

And we focus all our efforts on making a great product

In a few years everyone is going to have to do it

Green&c;a& impact&c;a& blah&c;a& If people are aware of the interconnections of our activities and pollution and how they affect us

Health- organisms they eat&c;a& animals and wildlife - things they value&c;a& a heavy cost and they will change behaviors

All these come together: Environmental law&c;a& corporate awareness&c;a& consumer awareness

EPR

Extended producer responsibility

2-3 schools decided 5-15&c;a&000 students in the schools

They decided to ask all the students to collect all the Frito lays

Pepsico indonesia - EPR - promised to start looking into what to do with the bags

Amsterdam

2025 - fritolay is promising that their bags will be environmentally friendly and they will prove it.

Don’t panic organize

Combined organized small fishes and let’s go after the big polluters

We do have big polluters who don’t have alternatives

No environmentally sound cement products

Instigate the

Nothing is created - nothing is lost

Whatever you save by being a polluter someone else is paying for that.

2015 - trash crisis triggered things

Although Europe has done this earlier - EU / UN to a certain extent

Are we late? Can we catch up? Europe has a head start?

Go ahead. - is there anything we can do to start to save the planet?

There are ways we can change the manufacturing to become more inline with circular economy

Legislation can be more enacted - the ministries need to be more on top of enforcement

There is a future and it’s not hopeless&c;a& effort from everyone (gov&c;a& consumer&c;a& corporations&c;a& industrial companies - need to be more active&c;a& Civil society (NGO’s)) Situation is so bad&c;a& we need to work on all

Consumers can create a demand.

Govornance - fix that and all our problems will be solved

(Takes too long -> so lets’ start doing things on our own)

Everyone will stand in line and do what needs to be done. Bridges are not going to be built twisted

Polluting water&c;a& no more

Most of the laws are there&c;a& lack of enforcement.

Awareness is important

Incentivizing the consumer to show appreciation to the industries/entrepreneurs who are doing the (NOT EXTRA) effort.

Other parties who are trying to raise awareness and are independent and objective so that the companies themselves don’t have to

It is driven by the market - we are all connected - we have high definition cameras video machines recorders. Anything you claim now - you better back it up.

Eventually someone will find out. Record and upload.

Sound business/industry - see changes

When they say the inspector comes over - the issue with the river for 30 years

The people who were inspecting were getting paid - azmet akhlaq before azmet govornance

Dummy fronts of buildings to cover the inspector - fake rather than real factory so they get the OK

We used to lack 25 years

Now that gap is reducing

CNC technologies - 3D printing - transfer of technology is reducing in time and we have a very dynamic very educated workforce

Percapita production of technicitions and engineers - they all go to khalig fo now

We have an educational infrastructure that can educate brains

Education is essential from a young age - home/schools

Fake infrastructure - that money could have been put into cleaning things up

Inactive dams - treatment plans abandoned -

Waste of money

Invested in wastewater treatment plant

Bu didn’t operate - because there’s a governance issue

There is no us or them&c;a& it’s just a we -

Paying the inspector

No one cares&c;a& big money projects

We’re not getting what we’re paying for

Design phase - has to pay someone to win the job

Lebanon still has a chance because we’re not a heavily industrialized country

Because we can more easily change our path forward

Quarries - geological challenge - our peaks our less high 30 years on

Transcription 2019-02-12 09:49:37 Transcription

Loïc Bussières:  21h in Paris&c;a& 1h less in universal time&c;a& the time of your Journal in French easy. It is Aurélien Devernois who presents with me this edition. Good evening Aurélien.

Aurélien Devernois:  Good evening.

LB:  In the headlines tonight: Venezuela and the ultimatum of European countries coming to an end. 7 countries&c;a& including France&c;a& had given Nicolas Maduro this evening to call for a new presidential election.

AD:  In El Salvador&c;a& the presidential election is precisely this Sunday. 5 million voters go to the polls. For the first time&c;a& he is a centrist who is a favorite of polls.

LB:  And then we'll come back to this announcement from Benyamin Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister says he is ready to use force against Iran&c;a& which has just announced the test of a long-range missile.

\-----

AD:  First of all&c;a& Venezuela&c;a& where President Nicolas Maduro has once again proposed legislative elections. While several countries of the European Union are asking for a presidential election.

LB:  This is Germany&c;a& Spain&c;a& France&c;a& Netherlands&c;a& Portugal&c;a& United Kingdom and Austria. In contrast&c;a& Russia&c;a& China&c;a& North Korea&c;a& Turkey or Cuba support Nicolas Maduro who rejects the ultimatum of European countries that had given him until tonight to organize the election otherwise they recognize self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido. Moreover&c;a& this crisis in Venezuela has significantly reduced the return to the country of the currencies. This weekend&c;a& the company Noor Capital&c;a& based in Abu Dhabi&c;a& has finally confirmed having conducted a gold exchange for foreign exchange on behalf of the Republic of Venezuela. An operation carried out in the legality and in the respect of the international law according to this company&c;a& but which raises many criticisms from the part opposed to the power in place. The explanations of  Romain Lemaresquier.

It is the American senator Marco Rubio&c;a& a great critic of the regime of Nicolas Maduro&c;a& who had revealed the affair on social networks. And after a long silence: Noor Capital has finally confirmed having purchased 3 tons of gold reserves of the Venezuelan central bank&c;a& in exchange for foreign currency. An operation much criticized by the slayers of the Chavista regime who accuse Noor Capital of allowing the survival of a financially depressed regime. After recognizing this transaction&c;a& Noor Capital announced that it would no longer conduct any such transactions with the Venezuelan State until the situation stabilized. An announcement that puts an end to two other operations that were to be conducted soon according to Reuters. A total of 29 tons of gold were to be sold. 15 tons were expected to be shipped to the United Arab Emirates soon&c;a& while another 11 tons were to be sold in mid-February. Operations scrutinized especially by the United States who warned the banking institutions not to do business with Venezuelan gold. The flight of capital is one of the recurring themes in this Venezuelan crisis. And even within the Venezuelan central bank a resistance seems to be put in place. Some employees refuse that Venezuelan assets be squandered. Moreover&c;a& two of them were fired last week because they refused to let the gold out of the banking institution.

LB:  I would add that Donald Trump reiterated that recourse to the US military in Venezuela was "an option" considered in the face of the political crisis that is shaking the country.

AD:  In El Salvador&c;a& some 5 million voters have gone to the polls to elect their next president.

LB:  Since the end of the civil war in 1992&c;a& two parties share the power: the ARENA&c;a& right&c;a& the ARENA&c;a& and the left party the FMLN&c;a& but today it is a candidate who is positioned rather in the center which is widely favored polls. His name is Nayib Bukélé&c;a& the GANA coalition candidate. He has campaigned on social networks&c;a& and his anti-corruption speech seduces&c;a& in a country largely affected by violence and poverty. Carlotta Morteo.

Jean&c;a& cap and leather jacket&c;a& impeccable beard&c;a& at 37&c;a& Nayib Bukele is the candidate for change. His credo: the fight against corruption. Its slogan: the end of impunity for elites who steal public money. The former mayor of San Salvador&c;a& who is of Palestinian origin and a professional publicist&c;a& enjoys a reputation as a good manager&c;a& and is known for securing and revitalizing the capital. In addition to his position neither left nor right&c;a& Nayib Bukele appealed to the youth and the urban middle class by his speeches on education&c;a& and his ideas to revive the economy: investment in industry&c;a& digital and agriculture by fiscal incentives and public subsidies&c;a& or tourism development&c;a& through the creation of a surf industry for example. All this&c;a& to stem the emigration of thousands of Salvadorans to the United States&c;a& and reduce the influence of criminal gangs. Gangs that have always had the means to influence the elections&c;a& and especially the participation rates. But given the huge gap in the polls between Nayib Bukele and his right-wing rival&c;a& millionaire Carlos Calleja&c;a& there is every chance that we will actually witness the end of bipartisanship in El Salvador.

AD:  Electoral news again&c;a& but in Senegal with the beginning of the presidential campaign today.

LB:  It will last three weeks&c;a& the first round is scheduled for February 24th. The outgoing Macky Sall&c;a& who is facing four other candidates&c;a& was holding a public meeting this Sunday in Touba. He hopes to be reelected in the first round as his predecessor Abdoulaye Wade in 2007.

AD:  22h in Tel Aviv. Also in the news&c;a& this announcement of Benjamin Netanyahu to the attention of Iran.

LB:  The Israeli prime minister warned this Sunday at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting that his country will not hesitate to use force against Tehran&c;a& including during the election campaign. This threat comes the day after the test of a new cruise missile with a range greater than 1350 km&c;a& a test announced as a "success" by the Iranian regime. Listen to  Benjamin Netanyahu.

"Today Iran celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and boasts of a new missile. Iran openly declares its intention to destroy the State of Israel. I have a clear message for the tyrants of Tehran: we know what you are doing and we know what you are about to do. We will continue to act against Iran with all the means at our disposal&c;a& so as to ensure the security of Israel and its future. "

AD:  In short&c;a& Theresa May reaffirms this Sunday her determination to execute Brexit on time.

LB:  And with a revised divorce agreement with its European partners&c;a& this is what the British Prime Minister explains. While "lingering uncertainty" on this issue has pushed the Nissan car firm to give up an investment in England.

AD:  In France&c;a& Emmanuel Macron in Paris suburbs on Monday. The Head of State will participate in a meeting in the context of the big debate.

LB:  In Evry-Courcouronnes&c;a& precisely&c;a& this is the first time that the President carries the subject in the suburbs. Immediately you have an appointment with  Yvan Amar.

A General of the Venezuelan Air Force has just sworn allegiance to Guaido. Not surprising information&c;a& but it revolves around this expression "to make allegiance". His meaning is very simple and very clear: General Yanez Rodriguez no longer recognizes the authority of Maduro and sided with Guaido. He changes his leader! He was under the authority of the President of the Republic. He places himself deliberately&c;a& that is to say on purpose&c;a& under that of the one who disputes him the power. He affirms his loyalty to the man who presents himself as the new head of state. The word&c;a& in French&c;a& comes from the Middle Ages and feudal practices&c;a& that is to say&c;a& which regulates the relations between the different lords. It is a hierarchy&c;a& that is to say an organization of powers&c;a& quite precise: each lord is under the authority of another&c;a& and that goes back to the king&c;a& who is only under the authority of God. He who has authority is the suzerain. He who obeys him is the vassal. And each noble is suzerain of him to whom he commands&c;a& and vassal of him to whom he obeys. And to make allegiance is to recognize someone&c;a& officially and solemnly&c;a& as his overlord. The expression can be used&c;a& as is the case here&c;a& if one changes sides: one shows it by designating the one one accepts as his superior. But we often hear the formula if someone has decided to have no leader at all&c;a& to be on his own&c;a& to admit no one's authority. And then things do not work as expected. The rebel does not escape&c;a& and he decides to return to the rank and again to obey a tutelage: he pledges allegiance to the one who represents this authority. -

Makeup.

A potential enhancer&c;a& a filter with "imperfections"&c;a& a subterfuge of seduction&c;a& a creative and theatrical adornment&c;a& a social cover ...

For me&c;a& makeup has long been a set of unknown products reserved for "women". A term that seemed to me then excluding for the girl little feminine and flirt that I was.

First&c;a& my personal quest for truth forced me to exclude the wearing of a mask. But how to determine what is a personal choice of what is social convention? The border was thin&c;a& and the reasons for my refusal of makeup more numerous.

The societal consensus around a feminine ideal is&c;a& of course&c;a& binding for women in the first place&c;a& but also for men&c;a& who unconsciously integrate this model of beauty - which I do not wish to perpetuate.

In a second time&c;a& I questioned the usefulness of make-up in a context of personal confidence. If such a small detail can contribute to the improvement of personal well-being&c;a& is not it worth it to pay attention to it?

After a few months of use&c;a& I developed a psychological dependence on this seemingly precarious apparatus. This thin layer of pigments alone had inhibited my ability to accept some of my appearance - my skin&c;a& my face! - and developed in parallel an addiction to - not a feeling of well-being - but the absence of malaise.

Because wearing this makeup that hides a few buttons and highlights my blue eyes&c;a& it was not a way to accentuate my confidence and my strengths&c;a& it was now a necessity to make them exist.

Conscious of this discomfort&c;a& I proceeded by step to detox me gently. My cure was to remove one ingredient at a time&c;a& then choose a "no" day&c;a& until you reach a majority of "no" days a week.

Of course the days of greatest importance were those where I exposed myself to the greatest number of social interactions&c;a& and those days represented huge steps to be taken for my personal self-esteem.

Because if my confidence in me is far from being reduced to my mere appearance&c;a& the environment in which I evolve does not deprive myself of judging me on this criterion "at first sight".

Arabic rap from Basra 2014: 2017-08-11 15:15:21 Arabic rap from Basra 2014:

Wrote a song with my bud Murtadha today and rapped it at Startup Weekend Basra. Sorta "One Love" meets Basra. English translation after the arabic: جوستين من بيروت و تليفون من tamimi  Basra is the city in which we are meeting و - بلبل طير صاير فترة  يا موعود ليش جاي هسة  يجولون الوضع كلش خطرة  كل العراق one big messa  بسa

نحن أعشاب العالم نحتاج أمطار العالم فريدلى كلامك - اردلك كلامي  نتعلم معا علما عميق و بيها طعم

ما تتصور كيف نطور  مع بعض نجهد  مع بعض نصور

صور نفسك نايم حليم إن العليم سير واحد إفتح عيناك باوع إن العالم حقا واحد  أنا أنت مسيحي و بنت كلنا عند قلبن واحد

قصتي قصتك - يحاتي يخصك  فرصة سعيدة أن أعتبرك  أخ أو أخت من نفس الأم

شاهدت أل علم شمال للجنوب  تغير بال شكل بس نفس القلوب

Translation: Justine is from Beirut and a phone call from Tameeemi Basra is the city in which we are meeting Wa bulbul(my nickname) is flying - it's been a while what the hell are you doing coming right now? they say the situation is horrible and it's really dangerous the whole country is one big mess but we're the weeds / plants of the world we need the water of the knowledgeable (or something weird like that&c;a& haha) so speak to me and I'll speak to you we'll learn together - knowledge that is deep and robust (or flavorful)

you would never guess how we'd grow and develop together we put effort and together we take pictures (or imagine)

imagine yourself sleeping dreaming that the world is one open your eyes and see that truly the world is one me&c;a& you&c;a& a christian and his daughter&c;a& we each have one heart

my story is your story and my life is important for you to pay attention to it's been really great to consider you a brother or sister from the same mother

I've seen the world north to south and there's a change in appearance&c;a& but the same heart. +BG I think it sounds better in Arabic. Haha! Hope you enjoyed it!

Hands on activities that they care about -> 3 months of working with them in a garden. This guy is like me -> start a relationship and empathy. To feel what they feel. What we are together.

Project needs to start with:

Empathy&c;a& relationship

Then doing projects of us

Curiosity first step to get momentum

Found a place to start a space

They asked for three workshops: Handcraft&c;a& Crochet&c;a& Community radio

The whole space is a designed project

Only get tools after people ask for tools. Don’t load up a space before people may not understand and be uneasy about the tools. Important point.

There was a big shift for me when I finally opened up to you and did… 2019-06-23 17:02:26 EThere was a big shift for me when I finally opened up to you and did my best to share as much as I /could/: what I remembered when I remembered. I understand hearing several things at different times was a lot to handle&c;a& and scary. It made you wonder how much more there was to reveal&c;a& if it would ever end.

I can't change the past&c;a& my mistakes&c;a& nor how I shared&c;a& when and how much. I can assure you that the shift was real though.

The night I broke down and felt like I was dying&c;a& dreaming of you handing me a razor blade was absolutely terrifying. I can't prove to you the fact that it changed me profoundly. I can simply say it. It broke me open for the best&c;a& as in: being really and completely honest&c;a& facing my darkness&c;a& choosing what to do with that&c;a& and setting my intentions for the rest of my life.

Eventually I chose to forgive myself and understand what led me to do such disgusting things. All our discussions helped me a lot to draw and understand a clear picture of the large context in which these mistakes took place.

I know you're never done growing&c;a& learning and refining. I also know this time was a stepping stone.

Part of me is proud of where I stand today&c;a& for not killing nor hating myself&c;a& but being able to forgive and love better.

All of me is deeply sad and disappointed for hurting you so badly.

Despite all this&c;a& I chose with my whole heart to want to be in a relationship with you&c;a& this time knowing much more precisely what I can/cannot handle&c;a& what I need&c;a& and what I want to build together.

Despite time being rather short between the revelation and the proposal&c;a& I thought this was a good way to get a feel for how you want to move forward. I felt comfortable with asking - I actually felt at peace and inspired.

I know for a fact that being chosen wholeheartedly is crucial to me. I know I will lose interest in our relationship by being tolerated rather than loved and cared for.

In the very beginning&c;a& the new me would have left or spoke up. I am choosing to accept the last five years for what they are: unsuccessful attempts at loving.

When you create something&c;a& you go through iterations&c;a& you throw away the first attempts (or keep it on the shelf because you actually care about seeing the work in progress!) and eventually come closer to the ideal you have.

I think our ideals were not aligned. Are they today?

Can we craft together with the same/a similar definition of what beauty and love are?

First and foremost: how engaged are we today?

——————————————————————-

It’s not just how/when you unfolded things&c;a& I am surprised that you knew how hurt I was from the time with Chris

How hard it hit me

I don’t think anything besides my nervous breakdown last summer about the hundreds of thousands of dead people in Iraq has ever hit me that hard. Kind of selfish I guess

Anyway&c;a& it hurts.

And what sometimes comes into my mind is - she saw me like that&c;a& and did things //again// after that. Many times. I know you were different then&c;a& and the first time (that you told me) probably was some sort of special situation. And knowing that and knowing that it happened again within a year&c;a& just does not compute for me.

I understand your transformation probably feels real to you. I also know that change is hard. And people don’t really change a whole lot&c;a& not after a certain age. It’s possible&c;a& lots of people have transformations when they convert or leave their homes&c;a& and I see myself at least when I watch myself&c;a& I’m a goofy creative person and I fall back to that always.

It’s interesting&c;a& you’re giving me what you want most&c;a& to be in a relationship with me. In terms of revelations and moving forward&c;a& I wanted to be engaged and live together (closer) for a year before getting married because I knew my feelings take about a year after each previous revelation to come to some sort of steady state. I guess we’re halfway through this time&c;a& although it’s not getting calmer&c;a& I’m feeling more and more upset. I’m feeling betrayed in a way that something I desperately wanted&c;a& to feel deeply in love and to be able to articulate it honestly&c;a& each time is taken away from me&c;a& and it makes me feel quite angry&c;a& surprised&c;a& and helpless. It’s what I want too&c;a& to be honestly able to say loving things&c;a& and love you&c;a& and hold you and be happy and it takes me a long time to let go of fear (first time) let go of disgust (second time) and now my anger and disgust and fear is feeling less hot and doesn’t shake me. It just feels pointless. In my mind I can hear things like&c;a& she can do whatever she wants&c;a& I don’t care. I am feeling apathetic&c;a& rather than hurt&c;a& unless I thin about it or talk about it then I’m surprised and angry again&c;a& more surprised by the fact that I haven’t left and angry that my rare moments of honest expression of love were stolen from me.

This is what’s happening now for me and I said yes to the proposal because I wanted to move forward and ease in after the second series of revelations that happened in Beirut. And then the third the day before felt like a trap&c;a& because there was no turning back.

It doesn’t seem to bode well for our marriage. What a start&c;a& huh?

I wonder what it would be like&c;a& or if it’s possible to break the rock crusted anger and surprise and resentment I feel and get to the core of the living parts again. At least when the lava was flowing I could see I also cared. Now I just want to cry at my loss. I’m not closing the door to forgiving you and not feeling upset towards you&c;a& it is a bit mixed up when you want me to do things to help you feel safer in life and in the relationship and I feel trapped in this position&c;a& and one day I can feeling no hard feelings between us. Is it possible for me to get to the point of loving again? Well&c;a& I know empathy is required&c;a& and each time I was so sorry for how things were going and the hurt you must have felt and I remember being able to understand and temper my hurt by understanding you. As hurt as I was I also cared. I’m not sure why that empathy is so much harder to feel. Maybe because the last revelation was earlier? Before I had a chance to hurt you so it was random? Perhaps because they kept coming&c;a& and the last one was sort of like a trap. Perhaps because now it just doesn’t even seem comparable anymore and I gave you enough excuses. I don’t know I’m trying to understand right now while writing…. I’m not attempting to be mean&c;a& and I don’t mean to come off as hopeless&c;a& I’m just opening up my mind to see what I don’t let myself sometimes even say to myself so perhaps we can find a way forward.

I think I had no idea that I wanted to be chosen (openly so&c;a& clearly) and that my partner wouldn't have romantic/deep/time consuming relationships with other women.

Also didn't think it was that important for my partner to commit clearly&c;a& to know what he wants&c;a& and to act on it with no hesitation.

I knew a feeling of settling was and is important to me&c;a& and that was lacking from the start in all aspects of our relationship. I was aware of that&c;a& and I didn't know if/when you'd want to be more settled. Hence: the marriage proposal as an opportunity to really find out.

What made you say "you're giving me what you want most: to be in a relationship with me"?

Let me correct something: What I want most (in terms of relationships) is to be with someone who dedicates him/herself to being loving and caring. To be there no matter what.

This is what I am trying to give you&c;a& and it doesn't feel like you want it - makes sense&c;a& today.

I think I could have set my Sway profile as "only looking for long term exclusive relationships"&c;a& had I known that's what I wanted. As you say: I am surprised I didn't leave. I care about you too&c;a& but that's not what made me stay: I can recognize now I was simply too scared to leave. I had found something exciting and meaningful&c;a& even if it was painful. The thrill was worth it apparently.

Do you really think I wanted to be a mean person? I know you are not&c;a& I think no one really wants to be mean&c;a& except rare occasions maybe&c;a& but that's not us. I hurt you because I was hurt&c;a& with no intention to hurt you. The only time I hurt you intentionally was in Berlin&c;a& after spending time with Lisa and we were in that hotel room at night. I felt so disrespected and hurt I remember hitting your leg. I was very angry&c;a& and immediately regretted.

I am not evil. I care for you&c;a& and I am damn clumsy. I have a hard time being articulate and understanding my needs and emotions. And I am also brave and willing to make things nice no matter what it takes&c;a& as long as there is respect. Maybe we're simply too different&c;a& incompatible in terms of what we need and have to offer. Maybe timing was off all along.

dual background - the waste studio 2019-04-26 14:24:40 Rdual background - the waste studio

Consultancy in geology and environmental science

Industrial 4500 licensed companies

Developed industrial sectors - paper&c;a& food/beverage

Chemical industries&c;a& Pharma

Food> impact in industrial output

Effluent being dropped without feeling pressure of legislation

Problem of enforcement of legislation

Industry does not pollute

Industrialist pollutes because he stops the process before it’s completely rehabilitated to save money

Consumers have a huge roll very soon

Everyone’s connected to everyone VIA social media

Preparing a platform to know about polluting industrialists to boycott their products

Does your favorite lebnah come from the factory that dumps WHEY in the litanyeh river?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litani\_River

What drives industries is environmental law and regulation of environmental law and ENFORCEMENT

Law: Environmental compliance law Class 1->3 industries need to carry out environmental audits and an environmental compliance plan with a deadline for compliance

First three classes are classified as most polluting

They should not be making as much profits as they are if they are incorporating the costs of environmental damage

Unfair advantage globally -> countries which don’t care for the environment they will not add that cost

\-Awareness will help because we can understand the total costs

Cumulative effect of pollution - if you want to sustain an industry

You can dump a few tons of waste for a while

Poluters who have been sued by the Litany river authority

Dumping whey into the river

Rich in protein

We can make whey powder - one of the essential ingredients of ice cream

ice cream manufactures:

They’re importing whey powder

And carob beans

We dump the whey powder and the carob beans without taking advantage of making ice cream

Industry and organic agriculture - most promising way to create jobs 5-10 year plans jobs to create - new economic activities we can generate

Policy and enforce it - or make it appealing to the businesses?

Demonstrating the industrial company can be both win win - show that it works for both environment and industrial companies

UNDOUGH - funded by EU - regional project sustainable consumption / production. How does a consumer identify which products find sustainable products VS

Circular economy

Integrated pollution prevention and control

Half a billion dollars sitting in the central bank for industries and cleaning industries

500&c;a&00&c;a&000$ dollars 2% rate

Banks are calling and asking if you have things coming up in the pipeline to build

Competitiveness of green products

You can pollute and save money

And your products will be more expensive

The gap between 4&c;a&000 and 5&c;a&000 LL -> is the cost difference between a “environmentally friendly” and non environmentally friendly product

TINY bit more expensive product that does a lot of good

We can comply with environmental standards - ant not at a high cost

By helping companies preventing pollution at source - 6 months

No&c;a& we’re not an NGO - we’re a responsible business

And the companies weren’t willing to sell them the waste banners

After two years and they came back to them&c;a& to take their banners and make products for the company as a part of their CSR program.

Awareness and legislation -

Some industries have toxic byproducts

You’re not supposed to be that much money because people and the environment will be impacted

Waste studio - part of our DNA - and we don’t promote ourself as

Being responsible is a part of our mission

And we focus all our efforts on making a great product

In a few years everyone is going to have to do it

Green&c;a& impact&c;a& blah&c;a& If people are aware of the interconnections of our activities and pollution and how they affect us

Health- organisms they eat&c;a& animals and wildlife - things they value&c;a& a heavy cost and they will change behaviors

All these come together: Environmental law&c;a& corporate awareness&c;a& consumer awareness

EPR

Extended producer responsibility

2-3 schools decided 5-15&c;a&000 students in the schools

They decided to ask all the students to collect all the Frito lays

Pepsico indonesia - EPR - promised to start looking into what to do with the bags

Amsterdam

2025 - fritolay is promising that their bags will be environmentally friendly and they will prove it.

Don’t panic organize

Combined organized small fishes and let’s go after the big polluters

We do have big polluters who don’t have alternatives

No environmentally sound cement products

Instigate the

Nothing is created - nothing is lost

Whatever you save by being a polluter someone else is paying for that.

2015 - trash crisis triggered things

Although Europe has done this earlier - EU / UN to a certain extent

Are we late? Can we catch up? Europe has a head start?

Go ahead. - is there anything we can do to start to save the planet?

There are ways we can change the manufacturing to become more inline with circular economy

Legislation can be more enacted - the ministries need to be more on top of enforcement

There is a future and it’s not hopeless&c;a& effort from everyone (gov&c;a& consumer&c;a& corporations&c;a& industrial companies - need to be more active&c;a& Civil society (NGO’s)) Situation is so bad&c;a& we need to work on all

Consumers can create a demand.

Govornance - fix that and all our problems will be solved

(Takes too long -> so lets’ start doing things on our own)

Everyone will stand in line and do what needs to be done. Bridges are not going to be built twisted

Polluting water&c;a& no more

Most of the laws are there&c;a& lack of enforcement.

Awareness is important

Incentivizing the consumer to show appreciation to the industries/entrepreneurs who are doing the (NOT EXTRA) effort.

Other parties who are trying to raise awareness and are independent and objective so that the companies themselves don’t have to

It is driven by the market - we are all connected - we have high definition cameras video machines recorders. Anything you claim now - you better back it up.

Eventually someone will find out. Record and upload.

Sound business/industry - see changes

When they say the inspector comes over - the issue with the river for 30 years

The people who were inspecting were getting paid - azmet akhlaq before azmet govornance

Dummy fronts of buildings to cover the inspector - fake rather than real factory so they get the OK

We used to lack 25 years

Now that gap is reducing

CNC technologies - 3D printing - transfer of technology is reducing in time and we have a very dynamic very educated workforce

Percapita production of technicitions and engineers - they all go to khalig fo now

We have an educational infrastructure that can educate brains

Education is essential from a young age - home/schools

Fake infrastructure - that money could have been put into cleaning things up

Inactive dams - treatment plans abandoned -

Waste of money

Invested in wastewater treatment plant

Bu didn’t operate - because there’s a governance issue

There is no us or them&c;a& it’s just a we -

Paying the inspector

No one cares&c;a& big money projects

We’re not getting what we’re paying for

Design phase - has to pay someone to win the job

Lebanon still has a chance because we’re not a heavily industrialized country

Because we can more easily change our path forward

Quarries - geological challenge - our peaks our less high 30 years on

Financials if it’s cheaper to bring cement or not

DO we have a strategy inlace?

////

We do have a strategy

Khutat istislah al aridi - in the law

Only this location are we allowed to have a kassarah

//

Why would I come to Lebanon - when you’re not competitive

How can you say

//

Cheaper to import cement from abroad

It’s going to be a perfect location

What each plot of land

What is it best used for

With the least environmental impact

The most amount of economic gain

Management of the field (in french)

Use public transport

Call RIM - write a comment on their page

Every week figure out what you’re using - ask them what they’re doing to be environmentally friendly

We are going to face a new garbage crisis - we will have practiced sorting and dumping Aramco

When will we figure out who is what and the where and the how

Huge legal repercussions here. When you go shame someone online&c;a& you’d better have a super solid case against them

platform needs building - they can sue us

Idea of platform is very important

Environmental experts and consultants with academia with instututions and ministries&c;a& all know each other and share information. We work in a scattered way and it’s time to unite and help each other. And bring academia into the mis

It’snot bad to benefit from doing the write thing. If they want to market it&c;a& let them have the credit.

Once a month

Once every two weeks

Once every 9 days

People just need the infrastructure is in place.

Area A has a 15 year lifespan of recycling plant - recycled&c;a& treated&c;a& composted&c;a&

Rmhala - built a biological treatment system using asab - and it works

Transcription 2019-02-12 09:49:37 Transcription

Loïc Bussières:  21h in Paris&c;a& 1h less in universal time&c;a& the time of your Journal in French easy. It is Aurélien Devernois who presents with me this edition. Good evening Aurélien.

Aurélien Devernois:  Good evening.

LB:  In the headlines tonight: Venezuela and the ultimatum of European countries coming to an end. 7 countries&c;a& including France&c;a& had given Nicolas Maduro this evening to call for a new presidential election.

AD:  In El Salvador&c;a& the presidential election is precisely this Sunday. 5 million voters go to the polls. For the first time&c;a& he is a centrist who is a favorite of polls.

LB:  And then we'll come back to this announcement from Benyamin Netanyahu. The Israeli prime minister says he is ready to use force against Iran&c;a& which has just announced the test of a long-range missile.

\-----

AD:  First of all&c;a& Venezuela&c;a& where President Nicolas Maduro has once again proposed legislative elections. While several countries of the European Union are asking for a presidential election.

LB:  This is Germany&c;a& Spain&c;a& France&c;a& Netherlands&c;a& Portugal&c;a& United Kingdom and Austria. In contrast&c;a& Russia&c;a& China&c;a& North Korea&c;a& Turkey or Cuba support Nicolas Maduro who rejects the ultimatum of European countries that had given him until tonight to organize the election otherwise they recognize self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido. Moreover&c;a& this crisis in Venezuela has significantly reduced the return to the country of the currencies. This weekend&c;a& the company Noor Capital&c;a& based in Abu Dhabi&c;a& has finally confirmed having conducted a gold exchange for foreign exchange on behalf of the Republic of Venezuela. An operation carried out in the legality and in the respect of the international law according to this company&c;a& but which raises many criticisms from the part opposed to the power in place. The explanations of  Romain Lemaresquier.

It is the American senator Marco Rubio&c;a& a great critic of the regime of Nicolas Maduro&c;a& who had revealed the affair on social networks. And after a long silence: Noor Capital has finally confirmed having purchased 3 tons of gold reserves of the Venezuelan central bank&c;a& in exchange for foreign currency. An operation much criticized by the slayers of the Chavista regime who accuse Noor Capital of allowing the survival of a financially depressed regime. After recognizing this transaction&c;a& Noor Capital announced that it would no longer conduct any such transactions with the Venezuelan State until the situation stabilized. An announcement that puts an end to two other operations that were to be conducted soon according to Reuters. A total of 29 tons of gold were to be sold. 15 tons were expected to be shipped to the United Arab Emirates soon&c;a& while another 11 tons were to be sold in mid-February. Operations scrutinized especially by the United States who warned the banking institutions not to do business with Venezuelan gold. The flight of capital is one of the recurring themes in this Venezuelan crisis. And even within the Venezuelan central bank a resistance seems to be put in place. Some employees refuse that Venezuelan assets be squandered. Moreover&c;a& two of them were fired last week because they refused to let the gold out of the banking institution.

LB:  I would add that Donald Trump reiterated that recourse to the US military in Venezuela was "an option" considered in the face of the political crisis that is shaking the country.

AD:  In El Salvador&c;a& some 5 million voters have gone to the polls to elect their next president.

LB:  Since the end of the civil war in 1992&c;a& two parties share the power: the ARENA&c;a& right&c;a& the ARENA&c;a& and the left party the FMLN&c;a& but today it is a candidate who is positioned rather in the center which is widely favored polls. His name is Nayib Bukélé&c;a& the GANA coalition candidate. He has campaigned on social networks&c;a& and his anti-corruption speech seduces&c;a& in a country largely affected by violence and poverty. Carlotta Morteo.

Jean&c;a& cap and leather jacket&c;a& impeccable beard&c;a& at 37&c;a& Nayib Bukele is the candidate for change. His credo: the fight against corruption. Its slogan: the end of impunity for elites who steal public money. The former mayor of San Salvador&c;a& who is of Palestinian origin and a professional publicist&c;a& enjoys a reputation as a good manager&c;a& and is known for securing and revitalizing the capital. In addition to his position neither left nor right&c;a& Nayib Bukele appealed to the youth and the urban middle class by his speeches on education&c;a& and his ideas to revive the economy: investment in industry&c;a& digital and agriculture by fiscal incentives and public subsidies&c;a& or tourism development&c;a& through the creation of a surf industry for example. All this&c;a& to stem the emigration of thousands of Salvadorans to the United States&c;a& and reduce the influence of criminal gangs. Gangs that have always had the means to influence the elections&c;a& and especially the participation rates. But given the huge gap in the polls between Nayib Bukele and his right-wing rival&c;a& millionaire Carlos Calleja&c;a& there is every chance that we will actually witness the end of bipartisanship in El Salvador.

AD:  Electoral news again&c;a& but in Senegal with the beginning of the presidential campaign today.

LB:  It will last three weeks&c;a& the first round is scheduled for February 24th. The outgoing Macky Sall&c;a& who is facing four other candidates&c;a& was holding a public meeting this Sunday in Touba. He hopes to be reelected in the first round as his predecessor Abdoulaye Wade in 2007.

AD:  22h in Tel Aviv. Also in the news&c;a& this announcement of Benjamin Netanyahu to the attention of Iran.

LB:  The Israeli prime minister warned this Sunday at the opening of the weekly cabinet meeting that his country will not hesitate to use force against Tehran&c;a& including during the election campaign. This threat comes the day after the test of a new cruise missile with a range greater than 1350 km&c;a& a test announced as a "success" by the Iranian regime. Listen to  Benjamin Netanyahu.

"Today Iran celebrates the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and boasts of a new missile. Iran openly declares its intention to destroy the State of Israel. I have a clear message for the tyrants of Tehran: we know what you are doing and we know what you are about to do. We will continue to act against Iran with all the means at our disposal&c;a& so as to ensure the security of Israel and its future. "

AD:  In short&c;a& Theresa May reaffirms this Sunday her determination to execute Brexit on time.

LB:  And with a revised divorce agreement with its European partners&c;a& this is what the British Prime Minister explains. While "lingering uncertainty" on this issue has pushed the Nissan car firm to give up an investment in England.

AD:  In France&c;a& Emmanuel Macron in Paris suburbs on Monday. The Head of State will participate in a meeting in the context of the big debate.

LB:  In Evry-Courcouronnes&c;a& precisely&c;a& this is the first time that the President carries the subject in the suburbs. Immediately you have an appointment with  Yvan Amar.

A General of the Venezuelan Air Force has just sworn allegiance to Guaido. Not surprising information&c;a& but it revolves around this expression "to make allegiance". His meaning is very simple and very clear: General Yanez Rodriguez no longer recognizes the authority of Maduro and sided with Guaido. He changes his leader! He was under the authority of the President of the Republic. He places himself deliberately&c;a& that is to say on purpose&c;a& under that of the one who disputes him the power. He affirms his loyalty to the man who presents himself as the new head of state. The word&c;a& in French&c;a& comes from the Middle Ages and feudal practices&c;a& that is to say&c;a& which regulates the relations between the different lords. It is a hierarchy&c;a& that is to say an organization of powers&c;a& quite precise: each lord is under the authority of another&c;a& and that goes back to the king&c;a& who is only under the authority of God. He who has authority is the suzerain. He who obeys him is the vassal. And each noble is suzerain of him to whom he commands&c;a& and vassal of him to whom he obeys. And to make allegiance is to recognize someone&c;a& officially and solemnly&c;a& as his overlord. The expression can be used&c;a& as is the case here&c;a& if one changes sides: one shows it by designating the one one accepts as his superior. But we often hear the formula if someone has decided to have no leader at all&c;a& to be on his own&c;a& to admit no one's authority. And then things do not work as expected. The rebel does not escape&c;a& and he decides to return to the rank and again to obey a tutelage: he pledges allegiance to the one who represents this authority. -

So you think I’m weak because I forgave?

disrespected me - did you even think about me? Washing the sheets?

Maybe I asked for it by asking god to bring you closer through our relationship

Invite angel and people to wedding

It’s not all her fault - she had lots of help&c;a& let’s discuss in public the messed up things society asks of people and sets them up to fail

Makeup.

A potential enhancer&c;a& a filter with "imperfections"&c;a& a subterfuge of seduction&c;a& a creative and theatrical adornment&c;a& a social cover ...

For me&c;a& makeup has long been a set of unknown products reserved for "women". A term that seemed to me then excluding for the girl little feminine and flirt that I was.

First&c;a& my personal quest for truth forced me to exclude the wearing of a mask. But how to determine what is a personal choice of what is social convention? The border was thin&c;a& and the reasons for my refusal of makeup more numerous.

The societal consensus around a feminine ideal is&c;a& of course&c;a& binding for women in the first place&c;a& but also for men&c;a& who unconsciously integrate this model of beauty - which I do not wish to perpetuate.

In a second time&c;a& I questioned the usefulness of make-up in a context of personal confidence. If such a small detail can contribute to the improvement of personal well-being&c;a& is not it worth it to pay attention to it?

After a few months of use&c;a& I developed a psychological dependence on this seemingly precarious apparatus. This thin layer of pigments alone had inhibited my ability to accept some of my appearance - my skin&c;a& my face! - and developed in parallel an addiction to - not a feeling of well-being - but the absence of malaise.

Because wearing this makeup that hides a few buttons and highlights my blue eyes&c;a& it was not a way to accentuate my confidence and my strengths&c;a& it was now a necessity to make them exist.

Conscious of this discomfort&c;a& I proceeded by step to detox me gently. My cure was to remove one ingredient at a time&c;a& then choose a "no" day&c;a& until you reach a majority of "no" days a week.

Of course the days of greatest importance were those where I exposed myself to the greatest number of social interactions&c;a& and those days represented huge steps to be taken for my personal self-esteem.

Because if my confidence in me is far from being reduced to my mere appearance&c;a& the environment in which I evolve does not deprive myself of judging me on this criterion "at first sight".

Today&c;a& -

Arabic rap from Basra 2014: 2017-08-11 15:15:21 Arabic rap from Basra 2014:

Wrote a song with my bud Murtadha today and rapped it at Startup Weekend Basra. Sorta "One Love" meets Basra. English translation after the arabic: جوستين من بيروت و تليفون من tamimi  Basra is the city in which we are meeting و - بلبل طير صاير فترة  يا موعود ليش جاي هسة  يجولون الوضع كلش خطرة  كل العراق one big messa  بسa

نحن أعشاب العالم نحتاج أمطار العالم فريدلى كلامك - اردلك كلامي  نتعلم معا علما عميق و بيها طعم

ما تتصور كيف نطور  مع بعض نجهد  مع بعض نصور

صور نفسك نايم حليم إن العليم سير واحد إفتح عيناك باوع إن العالم حقا واحد  أنا أنت مسيحي و بنت كلنا عند قلبن واحد

قصتي قصتك - يحاتي يخصك  فرصة سعيدة أن أعتبرك  أخ أو أخت من نفس الأم

شاهدت أل علم شمال للجنوب  تغير بال شكل بس نفس القلوب

Translation: Justine is from Beirut and a phone call from Tameeemi Basra is the city in which we are meeting Wa bulbul(my nickname) is flying - it's been a while what the hell are you doing coming right now? they say the situation is horrible and it's really dangerous the whole country is one big mess but we're the weeds / plants of the world we need the water of the knowledgeable (or something weird like that&c;a& haha) so speak to me and I'll speak to you we'll learn together - knowledge that is deep and robust (or flavorful)

you would never guess how we'd grow and develop together we put effort and together we take pictures (or imagine)

imagine yourself sleeping dreaming that the world is one open your eyes and see that truly the world is one me&c;a& you&c;a& a christian and his daughter&c;a& we each have one heart

my story is your story and my life is important for you to pay attention to it's been really great to consider you a brother or sister from the same mother

I've seen the world north to south and there's a change in appearance&c;a& but the same heart. +BG I think it sounds better in Arabic. Haha! Hope you enjoyed it!

3 - 4 months creating relationship:

First doing their projects for them

Email&c;a& meeting&c;a& conversations&c;a& calls&c;a& lectures?

Nah

Hands on activities that they care about -> 3 months of working with them in a garden. This guy is like me -> start a relationship and empathy. To feel what they feel. What we are together.

Project needs to start with:

Empathy&c;a& relationship

Then doing projects of us

Tacit knowledge&c;a& Curiosity

Curiosity first step to get momentum

Found a place to start a space

They asked for three workshops: Handcraft&c;a& Crochet&c;a& Community radio

The whole space is a designed project

Only get tools after people ask for tools. Don’t load up a space before people may not understand and be uneasy about the tools. Important point.

 Shaykh Hisham recently reminded us that when the mother of believers gave to those in need they would have there hands low and out in giving and the one receiving took from above their hands. —because in giving you are the one that is actually receiving—so who really is giving and receiving than? Ya Allah&c;a& subhanAllah 

From Me to Nia Malika Dixon: (Privately) (9:25 PM)

 Yeah&c;a& totally&c;a& the idea of empathy I found really struck me when I realized the Hadith about how god feels when a person repents&c;a& like a woman who has lost her child and then sees it in the battle field&c;a& rushes to take it to her breast. That anxious longing and love and worry and rahma - that’s how god feels for people who are sinners who are just beginning to repent.

Cover 1kg of sand with water and place in a crockpot at 90-95oC for 6 hours continually stirring

https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07D6K47HT?aaxitk=rnL.nb9DEpIHo-MmgScAfQ&pd\_rd\_i=B07D6K47HT&pf\_rd\_p=b9d09903-589f-4d25-a664-7518f8307b01&hsa\_cr\_id=6065168840802&sb-ci-n=productDescription&sb-ci-v=Crock%20Pot%20CSC051X-01%20Multi-Cuiseur%20Express%2C%20Mijoteuse%2C%20Cuiseur%20Vapeur%20et%20Saut%C3%A9%20Programmables%2012%20en%201-5%201000%20W%206%20L%20Argent&sb-ci-a=B07D6K47HT

Take it out and heat it to 200oC in a conventional oven or toaster oven

Slowly heat it up and stir it start at 90&c;a& take it out and stir it

100o take it out stir it

120 take it out stir it

140 take it out stir it

150o we start to approach the caramelization point of sugar so we need to take it out and stir more frequently

155 160 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200

And so on till you get to 200oC

At 200o leave it for an hour

Take it into a stainless steel bowl and cover with a piece of paper and on top of the paper add activated carbon to create a non reactive atmosphere

Final stage is to add 96-98% sulfuric acid soak it for 30 mins

Pour out extra acid and dry it at

120o for about an hour to make ultrasand

TADA!

Poem: 2019-11-19 12:20:23 Poem:

Love is a creative act - an intense thing to being together two universes

Entire meaning making machines

And asking them to sing together asking about the possibility that we are not lonely

Not Lone in our manifestingbof meaning from void

Beyond all the superficial

Everyone has a mind - a consciousness

And our actions are both and

The sudden springing of action off the top of the water when you rub your finger on its rim

That feeling we have of maybe him

Her

Maybe together

I am more than complete in my aloneness

I am completion

Yet perhaps we

Is better than me

In my greatness I see that I am everything

In my humility I see that everything is everything

And in the tension of emerging possibility

Of collapsing waveforms influenced by people's mastery of mind

That maybe loving another

And bringing them close

To be in awe of the show we are creating

Will allow softness to become strength

And

Perhaps it's more than true

That love concurs all

Starts with a portal into another self

Another uni verse

Another word smith

Forging meaning from concepts wrought from the thoughts before time

In a rare space&c;a& not due to any specialness of being - simply a consequence of time. Being alive is special

Being human is absurdly unlikely

Being a human with the ability to consider ones thoughts - a fleeting chance to be born as such

Being brave enough to peruse and accept what you think - timeless

I am not a messenger because the mediums we live in transmit all we need to know - I am an agent who's learning the ropes of mastery of my own mind

And thus and through this and with love - identifying the levers to play with society - that is till my embodied experience is over then it's back to the hummmmmm the unspoken&c;a& back to the bottom of the cup&c;a& to let another dreamer rise - to take shape - to dance after me - my children&c;a& I hope - will have my words not first in mind

But in back of their minds

Creating possibility

Encouraging bravery

Seeing uncertainty truly as the potential air beneath their wings

To breath the air of a better future not as I see it&c;a& simply as a matter of fact

New truths

New rules to break

Because my dreams of potentials are limited

Yet my source is unlimited

So when it's time to step back

I build one layer of the coral reef

I've done my art

In creating a worthy narrative

The art of gods

Don't judge a person by the color of their skin

by the strength of their imagination for hope

By their faith and courage in the face of uncertainty

By their clarity of purpose and knowing

By their generosity of "listening which is love"

These are a few of the ideas are worth weaving into the narrative of human kind

I may be creator of my meaning

I am still created

And my inspiration still is beyond me

That gravity

That law to which I chose to obey s

That is the unpointable mystery

Not in mind

Not in world

Felt in what I can only describe as the soul

Perhaps mastery of mind has only one output

To put us in service of our soul

Once our mind is mastered we see the nature of our soul

And its inclination towards values

And that when we incline our minds

And that when we incline as well our bodies

That when we use our stories and chanting and programming to reinforce those values

We feel uplifted and good

The reward is the transmission

Can this be a deception?

Are there values that my soul will disagree with

Or that the machine which marches forward - the human evolution to goodness machine haha

Will see as a setback?

> notes:

Don't judge a person by the color of their skin

by the strength of their imagination for hope

By their faith and courage in the face of uncertainty

By their clarity of purpose and knowing

By their generosity of "listening which is love"

These are a few of the ideas are worth weaving into the narrative of human kind

It takes a whole and open life to ping all the ports

Haha

To see which responds with knowledge

And it takes a lifetime of implementing to see the fruits of wisdom

To build from an inkling of goodness

Of values

The platform of wisdom

Which becomes the "knowledge" of future generations

Of more openness acceptance love and possibility

Yes

I see joe

Values are a big deal

They are from which emerges legends

Values are the granite from which legends are hewn / chiseled

And values are whispered at first if one is quiet and can listen

Something like

This is a better way

Hansel and gretel cookie crumbs to a future

We have free will - sure

And the source has a plan

There is something bigger than grand in the recognizing and perusing of ones values

I don't want my values to align with someone else's

I want my love to be a path towards better embodied values

Better ways of living

To create a platform for our children to stand upon

Where skin color doesn't matter - it's transparent in their eyes

The world and the narratives we've woven for them are one step closer

One cookie crumb closer to where god is calling us

I may be creator of my meaning

I am still created

And my inspiration still is beyond me

That gravity

That law to which I chose to obey s

That is the unpointable mystery

Not in mind

Not in world

Felt in what I can only describe as the soul

Perhaps mastery of mind has only one output

To put us in service of our soul

Once our mind is mastered we see the nature of our soul

And its inclination towards values

And that when we incline our minds

And that when we incline as well our bodies

That when we use our stories and chanting and programming to reinforce those values

We feel uplifted and good

The reward is the transmission

Can this be a deception?

Are there values that my soul will disagree with

Or that the machine which marches forward - the human evolution to goodness machine haha

Will see as a setback?

Timelines ar the start which we update

Culture is a noun

Islam is a verb

Mala 3ynun raat

Learning was the main goal

Not winning

Once you realize that do something different

It was a training program not a winning competition

Military psychology pilot

Decrease temperature

Repetitive loud music

They expected us to look around corners

See the end

Connect cases with real-time experiences and apply lessons

Jay Pottharst true and do you think the value we give it is an social award to people willing to dedicate the hours. Sort of an “I’m proud there exists humans who can do this and it part of that pride is knowing I can’t and so here’s my pride as $” - that’s the process part of the whole time it takes to practice&c;a& experiences to conceive the idea&c;a& and in the moment execution. Thoughts?

Otherwise it’s just pretty pixels. I’ve been exploring some part of this with https://wayway.ai - still in data gathering phase

Dear anxiety

I’m sorry you’re around&c;a& there’s nothing you can do about the situation so just let it go

I’m not sure what you expect will happen if you keep sqeaking

hurting my stomach&c;a& making me all twisted and tied up.  Chill it out already

I am working on all the things we need

Dear Gratitude

I’m glad you’re here&c;a& I think you can be an antidote

What am I grateful for

What did I do to deserve this life. It’s a total gift

Like such a miracle we even exist at all&c;a& right? What a wild world this is&c;a& I have money to do experiments with&c;a& I have something like a ton of minerals to make paints with

It’s a good day to be happy

I have a lovely wife who’s talented

And she loves me and wants to be happy so why not? I wonder if I really realized how surprising it is (entirely a gift) this everything is that perhaps i will be more willing to be happy

Why am I unwilling&c;a& who knows&c;a& generosity you might want to come and sprinkle the good stuff you have.

Hope/despair

What does it take to lean into hope for me&c;a& how long does one need to hope till it’s ok to despair. What’s the relationship between despair

Age is a thing

Just because you’re doing some practices&c;a& doesn’t mean you’re ok

Core funding is critical

I’m lost fund and bootcamp&c;a& geezer gap year

What can bring aliveness is an important question

Leadership is also a thing&c;a& a skill

Work we’re doing already based on a direction that’s already been set. 
Intentionally setting results and deliverables then it could work

Leader:	Name
Note taker:	Kaisu
___________________________________________________________________________

Notes:
Topics, structures topics that help us to move from Horizon 1 to Horizon 2. Generating specific ideas. 
A little bit more structure and guidance would help a lot. Towards where are we heading? 
If we have ideas to share ideas to implement in wellbeing curriculum, which is the platform to enable collaboration. Open, visible, easy to use. 
An element of leadership is needed to be strengthened. 
It is useful to have the conversation of what people want to turnh that to clear actions. 
What is the prelog of the network? Would be nice to know the narrative from the past to build the narrative of the future. 
For instance in this gathering everything that has been done has been enjoyable but sometimes missing which are the bigger purposes of things. 
We need to get down to the basics; articulating the point of the network, to be able to figure out what are our goals. We could have a better onboarding plan. 
If you ask people what this network is about they may be related but there are many definitions. 
Disciplinary or interdisciplinary outcomes of what we want to have 
Ideas from others and see how to apply in ones own different context
Once having clear goals we can also measure wins and losses and share them, learn from them. 
Knowing the end goal is critical to know how to build the path. 
For new members or the ones that did not necessary drive their participation in the network its not being clear on how to see or build a clear direction. Need of understanding which is the framework/playground. 
How could we reach into a stonger leadership model to show direction. 
How could we come up with a blueprint for our process. 
To have a resource of what people have been doing and showcase – receive feedback, other ideas. 
Ability to connect more and more on an individual level outside of the encounterings and forums. Projects or working groups but also ways to connect in an individual level. 
It may be also a reflection of the network that the 
Past – small amout of institutions coming together, putting their blueprints together, editorial work of what this network may mean. Suddenly a huge growth in the network – somehow seeing what each one does and who we really are. The workgroups were built – documentation, barriors to wellbeing (commonalities and barriers), curriculum group broke up into multiple subgroups – building curriculum wide spectrum; specific to wellbeing, community; divided in to students faculty and different schools trying to find funding together. After all that we took the first day to see what was good on looking into the working groups, stage two where are we now and where do we want to head, and now trying to see what can be needed in concrete to take the next steps. 
Best practises and/or renaissance in higher ed with wellbeing at the core; how could we help each other to get that by convincing policy makers, presidents and funding…
90 members, different levels of participation; we have 2 years to get ourselves on the track, that is the time that Wellbeing is sustaining much of the coordination. 
How can this serve everyone in a way that is important. 




Action Steps:
Building a clear vision and goals → robust plan of involvement
Sharing best practises and seeing the best way to do so – Monthly conversations and themes to work on, or dividing based on projects. This requires more organizational ledership
Goals that unite, even if there can be different priorities. 
Onboarding plan – clarity in what is going on and how can you be part and take advantage of it
Focus and dynamics
Commonalities and working areas to work on
Directory of people their interests and their willing to be contacted for….

Based on direction - co-woning and codirection. Not ready for that yet. Some form of leadership. Someone who has authority of direction. Someone who says ‘this is the point, this is direction” - based on that we make a year plan.

When a person comes in after that establishment - people can start working because there is a structure.

General need: curriculum. Design session.

Codesigning curriculum then coming back and contextualizing.

Knowledge sharing: It’s now the job of each member to contextualize. This is what we designed/contextualized and share.

Everyone is beautiful and nice and food is good…. What’s happening?

Q. Do we need specific goals for the network? Do we need to set specific goals for the network?

Concern is to add work on top of our work. Set a different work plan w/different goals / priorities would people do it?

O: Goal number 1, who is leadership/authority of direction. Articulate that and disseminate.

We were working in groups but largely unproductive because we were not directed.

Work we’re doing already based on a direction that’s already been set.

Intentionally setting results and deliverables then it could work

Bahare:

I’m so sleepy.

I didn’t get to talk to everyone here and there are more people who are not here.

Make the community and give us more instruction and framework to do our own parts in it.

Elisa:

DB to filter and search who might be interesting to talk to a mandatory spotlight on who they are and a challenge they are facing.

See the projects people are working on.

Bilal

If you liked someone call them.

Doughnut put availability and schedule chats with people

Onboarding - easier when there is clarity.

Foster engagement, subcircles, regional events.

Banking of talents.

Estefania - nature growth? Facilitation guide for wellbeing ambassadors.

Identify existing wellbeing definitions for higher education institutions.

Resonate w/xy or z

Working groups, call to clarify purpose. Overarching purpose. Set expectations and milestones.

Mapping what we have - not constructing new things. Pep already has working group.

Leave here with something we are interested in developing with other members.

What’s working / not working .

Choosing the right technology.

Notion could be applied for everyone.

Spotlight moments.

Notes:

Topics, structures topics that help us to move from Horizon 1 to Horizon 2. Generating specific ideas.

A little bit more structure and guidance would help a lot. Towards where are we heading?

If we have ideas to share ideas to implement in wellbeing curriculum, which is the platform to enable collaboration. Open, visible, easy to use.

An element of leadership is needed to be strengthened.

It is useful to have the conversation of what people want to turnh that to clear actions.

What is the prelog of the network? Would be nice to know the narrative from the past to build the narrative of the future.

For instance in this gathering everything that has been done has been enjoyable but sometimes missing which are the bigger purposes of things.

We need to get down to the basics; articulating the point of the network, to be able to figure out what are our goals. We could have a better onboarding plan.

If you ask people what this network is about they may be related but there are many definitions.

Disciplinary or interdisciplinary outcomes of what we want to have

Ideas from others and see how to apply in ones own different context

Once having clear goals we can also measure wins and losses and share them, learn from them.

Knowing the end goal is critical to know how to build the path.

For new members or the ones that did not necessary drive their participation in the network its not being clear on how to see or build a clear direction. Need of understanding which is the framework/playground.

How could we reach into a stonger leadership model to show direction.

How could we come up with a blueprint for our process.

To have a resource of what people have been doing and showcase – receive feedback, other ideas.

Ability to connect more and more on an individual level outside of the encounterings and forums. Projects or working groups but also ways to connect in an individual level.

It may be also a reflection of the network that the

Past – small amout of institutions coming together, putting their blueprints together, editorial work of what this network may mean. Suddenly a huge growth in the network – somehow seeing what each one does and who we really are. The workgroups were built – documentation, barriors to wellbeing (commonalities and barriers), curriculum group broke up into multiple subgroups – building curriculum wide spectrum; specific to wellbeing, community; divided in to students faculty and different schools trying to find funding together. After all that we took the first day to see what was good on looking into the working groups, stage two where are we now and where do we want to head, and now trying to see what can be needed in concrete to take the next steps.

Best practises and/or renaissance in higher ed with wellbeing at the core; how could we help each other to get that by convincing policy makers, presidents and funding…

90 members, different levels of participation; we have 2 years to get ourselves on the track, that is the time that Wellbeing is sustaining much of the coordination.

How can this serve everyone in a way that is important.

Action Steps:

Building a clear vision and goals → robust plan of involvement

Sharing best practises and seeing the best way to do so – Monthly conversations and themes to work on, or dividing based on projects. This requires more organizational ledership

Goals that unite, even if there can be different priorities.

Onboarding plan – clarity in what is going on and how can you be part and take advantage of it

Focus and dynamics

Commonalities and working areas to work on

Directory of people their interests and their willing to be contacted for….

Leader: Name

Note taker: Ed Stevenette

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Notes/Possible projects:

Round 1

Project to Map the assets of members in the network => skills workshop or questionnaire to map skills / expertise / tools of members in the network to avoid duplication, maximise our efforts, and shape projects based on these assets

E.g. LearningPlanet projects and events platforms were developed over many years due to needing spaces to key track of the initiatives / resources / events in communities, adapted to needs of social impact networks and institutions. Could be used by the Wellbeing network. Also experience on crowdsourcing resources / funders / policy connected to a topic : example of the gallery here.

Project to design holistic Wellbeing strategy to guide institutions

\- Guidance to build the holistic strategy to improve the wellbeing in the university. E.g. Whole University Approach (has been used in the UK, early days, could be interesting to adapt this to the needs of the global education community)

\- How to impact the strategies of Director generals to bring wellbeing at the center. Elaborating the concept of holistic wellbeing so it is not just ‘another service’.

Project to help students to discover and develop their vocation as a network =>

E.g. Ikigai+ working group (Pep, Pascal, Claire…)

Project to create regional immersion programmes e.g. members spending ¾ days at Koc University, or Oxford, or LPI… Could make this regionally focused (e.g. 3 to 4 local institutions coming together), or available for the whole network. Maximising the benefits of place-based, and feeding this into the weaving of the network. Creating a goal of some output of these exchanges.

Project to document tools => If we (the network) were to die in 5 years, what are we leaving behind for the good of the planet?

\- Resources, project examples, toolkits. To make ourselves accountable to leave behind value for the world even when we might not be here in our current form

Example here from AIME mentoring of why they have created a ‘death strategy’ : https://aimementoring.com/2023/01/20/the-aime-intentional-death-strategy/

Project : interactive newsletter to share offers / needs

https://superhive.is/

Project to create Wellbeing certification/labelling? E.g. B-Corp for wellbeing

\- Case making for institutions to become ‘Wellbeing institutions’

\- example : Okanagan charter : https://wellbeing.ubc.ca/okanagan-charter . Focused on wellbeing within policy. Our charter could be commitment to inner development of individuals/communities?

\- Could be done in 3 days! e.g. ‘ In June 2015, UBC co-hosted the International Conference on Health Promoting Universities and Colleges at the Okanagan campus, bringing together participants from 45 countries, representing both educational institutions and health organizations, including the World Health Organization and UNESCO. Over three days, these organizations collaborated on the development of the Okanagan Charter: An International Charter for Health Promoting Universities and Colleges.’

Project to share the stories and challenges institutions face in becoming wellbeing institutions

E.g. Said Business School : one indicator for going high in uni rankings is salary of students post-graduation. Leads to those championing the corporate futures getting high up. Issue in the system. Important these stories are shared.

Write here..

Round 2

+2 for project for easy documentation of projects / tools / knowledge/ expertise, and making it easy to sift through this info based on needs. Can be also a way of building inner communities based on whoever has shared needs/projects>

\- ‘Marketing to everyone is marketing to no-one’ => Get a group of people together with a shared interest. Building from there.

+1 for project building the Wellbeing project network definition of wellbeing / criteria and or core values to unite the way we do things.

+1 for project sharing case studies of the local realities (makes the case for setting up regional collaborations / immersions)

+1 for project to reflect on responsibility to know what we are leaving behind for future ‘generations’

NEW : Project to make / connect groupings in the network based on similar backgrounds. Making sure these people discuss/collaborate as priority, and that then weaving can occur across these audience.

3 groupings seem to exist in the wellbeing project. Setting up specific working sessions between members of these different groups.

1\. Pioneering institutions

Those who are already living and breathing wellbeing.

E.g. Mondragon University

2\. Faculty in established institutions

Those advocating / running wellbeing projects/programmes/research within large institutions

E.g. Member of Harvard, Stanford

3\. The network / community builders / social entrepeneurs

Those advocating / connecting / leveraging wellbeing projects in the social impact space e.g. LearningPlanet

Notes: Ana Celia,

Part of the mission of the program: take care of the changemakers - share wellbeing practices with those around us. Build momentum – a movement

Advocate for formalized wellbeing programs in higher education institutions

Lacking a strategic plan - need to generate umbrella priorities – with specific projects

Develop skills to manage projects in different group - timelines, identify clear indicators - then reflect, shift for iterative process.

Structure for documentation

Need a clear definition of well-being – an umbrella (universal?) definition / framework that can be translated, adapted in the range of institutional contexts. Should members of the network review Dr. Richard Davidson’s 4 Pillars of Wellbeing: Awareness, Connection, Insight, Purpose – as a starting point

Common curated research hub – building research (pilot studies, collaborative research between universities)

Hub for wellbeing in higher ed projects - template for institutions to complete (info about mission, objectives, etc.)

Establish an online platform for social connecting, peer learning/inquiry, mentoring, research, projects - for cross-pollination

Directory with members’ respective areas of expertise

During the year, have meetings with step-back consultation - about dilemma re: wellbeing in higher education - one person presents a dilemma, then “steps back” to listen as the group discusses the dilemma, ways to address via wellbeing framework, etc.

Working groups need a reboot - restructuring, protocol, with timeline, goals,

Community of practice - library of resources (videos, etc.) - on a platform - to help us have more voice and sense of agency - shift in mindset

Identify and develop collaboration possibilities across/between institutions

North star, values, strategic planning (manual, templates, etc.) - more clearly define re: wellbeing in higher education

Syed Jamaluddin 

Slow down business:

Candle
Bukhur
Tea

Psychological / spiritual 

Earthy / fitri 

Not all about making money - oud 

Passionate about it. 

I’d prefer to be a partner - building with things is a part of what I want to do.
Building movements / NGOs 

Now I want to build entrepreneurial things. 

Big interest in Oud 
Jamaluddin’s position is we should partner up. Not necessarily all at once. Starting with writing down what does a partnership look like. 

Roles of each person and how much time
Aim of the venture

What are the economical expectations so we can be sure to be sustainable. Not necessarily 

Doing something that gives me the connection to Allah (SWT) 

Nur = nur Mohammed (S) 

How can we make it more straightforward 

No brand that connected with the sunnah of the prophet (s) - 
Sandals on the packaging 

Ethical Silver: https://www.ft.com/content/493b2668-5d00-11e3-a558-00144feabdc0
Ethical Bullion Company,
https://theecologist.org/2009/mar/01/can-silver-ever-be-ethical


In person stuff - testing 

Japanese tea ceremonies 

Kuala lampur 
London
Orjiva 


lectures/workhshops how to create tea
Producers of oud - lectures of the work - Tajul Bakhshi 
Become a partner . feel an ownership of it

Costs vs expenses. 
For the big events 

Marketing. In person marketing / events / interested in it. 
Social media marketing - clueless. 

Lots of connections in Istanbul / Kuala lampur / London lots of connections

Spiritual / psychological event 

Sustainable business 

How to sell it in a sustainable way. 

Story we can share:
TRT - selling products 
Sharing the oils and the producers 


Combine oils . 

How to be successful: Make other people successful 

Train locals to do the events themselves 

Franchise models - sell vitamins 

Gradual working together?
SJD: I know I want to be a part of it. I want to market it as - I want to feel like I want to build things / I want to create things. 
The ratio really depends. 

Freelancer - better feeling / process orientation.

Yearning for writing lyrics. 

Allowing SJD to invest in it

Partnership doesn’t need to be 1/3rd right now
Could be 10% in time. 

Another way could be to consider a new business that’s about workshops utilizing the oils
Send you some teas to sample

What $ investment leads to what % of the company. 
BG: we’re not really in a need for investment to grow right now, so I don’t know

Milia: Wellbeing is everything in the workspace being stable. 
Everything stable economically, physically and socially. 
Sarah: Well-being is an ongoing process, and it's important to adapt your approach based on the unique needs and challenges of our stakeholder with the environment 
the environment = various parties that may have an effect on our behavior
Amanda: added, And to live whenever and wherever we are in a friendly environment surrounded by nature, love, family and team work
Annie: Wellbeing can be collective and individual
Rim: well-being stems from the knowledge of having a safe space, a safety net, in your environment
Dara: wellbeing means feeling safe in my body, mind and heart in harmony with my surroundings
Aya: the state of mind due to internal and external factors, that helps us feel at peace inside 
Rida: Physical well-being → good diet and regular exercise; Mental Wellbeing; aligning thoughts, words, and actions + moderate rest :)
Munir: Having a “personal toolkit” for how to respond when stressful or challenging situations arise, both as individuals and as a group / community 
Peter: Have a sustainable and flexible working place that allows the employee have their freedom and flexibility to achieve their duties and goals. 
Dima: It is a balance between work and personal life. They complement each other and reflect on our well-being

How to prioritize: Health/Mental Health/Financial Health. 
Massive demands - everyone wants to talk to you, demands on your knowledge and experience. 
Few times per day I divide my day - 2 hours I focus on writing articles. 2 hours on campus 2 hours being with family. 
Dara taught me how to put my cellphone on do not disturb. 
It’s not available, people demand us to be available 24/7. We need to sleep at some point. 
One of my students called me at 11PM - Dr. you’re online can I ask a question!

Annie Seferian - 
Anecdote during corona: Lots of fear of corona, management was realizing it’s important to talk about wellbeing and mental health for the orgnaization. 
It went beyond our KPIs. 
If employees are in trouble, talk to eVPs - suddenly it became top priority. Even above other KPIs.
Mckinsey article: social financial, educational, financial and freedom. 
Takes effort to focus on the culture of getting work done and doing it in a peaceful way rather than “clocking in 9-5” - without engagement / caring. Wellbeing should be directed towards getting things done in a collaborative setup.
Ask them if they’re doing this role/task. What if I’m doing it on my own time/expense. 

Mohammed Alafifi - 
When we talk about stress we think it should be more for the smaller companies. It’s interesting that it’s larger for the larger organizations.
It’s easier to work with and help adapt the culture in smaller companies.

Aya JYIF - 46% of the causes of stress is the workload 28% other - family/social life.
Work is the main cause of stress worldwide

Talking about stress and how we can address that. 
Aya is open to talk with people about stress management at work as well as with the teams we train. 
Managers have a responsibility - AND - individuals have a responsibility 
Lots of factors managers can work
We must focus on the human side - 
There are a lot of benefits - If this is what it takes to convince employers to consider wellbeing

Bilal Question: **Startups and our early stage entrepreneurs - (including myself) - how do I allow myself to rest and have a balanced day with family / break / and work while still making sure the company doesn’t collapse.

You need to sett the boundaries … you need to say that to your self 1st, you are important as much as the team … you are important as much as the enterprise ! if you collapse the team will collaps as well, and so the enterprise ! 
You set boundaries … set the list of priorities on your agenda ( your agenda is your fram work! Its, your road toward your goal); get to say NO, you can’t please all people arround ! have a clear working hours ! (from 9am to 5pm per exemple ) ….  

Rim: How do you set boundaries?
Participants might call in the evening, calls/emails, etc. 
All teams are in an emergency state - they have 100000 tasks and your response is needed IMMEDIATELY. 
Make boundaries and set it so it’s clear that we’re available only during workhours. 

Other team members shouldn’t interrupt during break days. 
BG: How do you set boundaries when we may be understaffed/underresourced? 
Rim: Sometimes we have to.. We establish a support system. 
Whenever you’re free you can rest. When there’s rush time-rush, and when you can rest you can rest. 
Rim: Support each other across departments. 

Mohammed/Layla: Agency really cares about the wellbeing of their staff. We are FORCED to take days off. Contractors are paid by hour and the organization pushes people to take time off.

We are two of us. We don’t overload ourselves. We have a wheel of life chart 

IQ - Intelligence quotient
EQ - Emotional quotient 
BQ - Body quotient 
SQ - spiritual quotient 

Sometimes we have to GO TO THE BEACH with our two little girls. 

This is a great sign of how to influence culture!

Mohammed/Layal: Checkin channel - some people come in and say “I don’t feel well, I can’t work today.” 

Dara: Bloom takes a break twice a week a year so EVERYONE is off at the same time. That way it really helps people really relax because there is no work that’s “piled up” when people come back 
We can checkin with our whole self. 
Cosmic Centaurs Blueprint for an Intentional Summer

DMN: Reflecting is not a takeaway from work time. It’s an enabler for effective work time.
We are all the entrepreneur of our own lives. Make the smart decisions over short/medium/long to go towards the direction we want to go is critical.  
When you’re a founder, you have an effect on other people’s lives as well. Good decisions on prioritization is really important. We only have 24 hours a day. 


Aya: 
Work/life balance - impressive. We have to remind ourselves to speak up. 
Sometimes managers just DON’T KNOW - d


Once you know the vision / purpose of what you’re doing - it helps with feeling fine/comfortable because your vision is aligned.

Consider personal/professional goals. What about personal development goals? 
What do //you// desire to learn to develop in terms of skills. 

Universal Skills? Public speaking skills. I want to keep learning - my own 

Mohammed and Layal: Reflection quote: "I am not who you think I am; I am not who I think I am; I am who I think you think I am"

How does this relate to how we design our entrepreneurial programs? 

When you understand yourself and see how you are a part of the systems you’re a part of helps you act skillfully. 

Peter Abdel Karim: Entrepreneur, a part of many programs, digital marketing/graphic design/many hats.

From my learning journey. Being in a supportive community / learning from others / hear from other people’s feedback. <3 working with people who give constructive feedback.


Essentialism - The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown

The businessman and the fisherman - The Storytellers

Layal: All of my favorite projects were probono projects, causes were amazing. Made by people who can’t afford to do it. Yet they were the projects I LOVED the most. 
Makes you feel good to know you’re working for a cause that’s contributing to a community. Sometimes it’s much better than being paid a ton that you don’t enjoy or doesn’t do any good. 

What if we can do more of the ones that align most with our values.

Mental stress can manifest in the body
Interesting concept: EnterTraining
Workload and Stress Management - is how to manage with well-being at work!! … stressful environment can be hard to handl ! and to coop with ! (that’s why all research highlight the importance of time management)




Dr. Sarah Makhoul- 
Head of finance department at LU faculty of science
Career center at LU.
How to combine psychology in science/ financial aspects. 
How to prioritize: Health/Mental Health/Financial Health. 
Massive demands - everyone wants to talk to you, demands on your knowledge and experience. 
Few times per day I divide my day - 2 hours I focus on writing articles. 2 hours on campus 2 hours being with family. 
Dara taught me how to put my cellphone on do not disturb. 
It’s not available, people demand us to be available 24/7. We need to sleep at some point. 
One of my students called me at 11PM - Dr. you’re online can I ask a question!

Annie Seferian - 
Anecdote during corona: Lots of fear of corona, management was realizing it’s important to talk about wellbeing and mental health for the orgnaization. 
It went beyond our KPIs. 
If employees are in trouble, talk to eVPs - suddenly it became top priority. Even above other KPIs.
Mckinsey article: social financial, educational, financial and freedom. 
Takes effort to focus on the culture of getting work done and doing it in a peaceful way rather than “clocking in 9-5” - without engagement / caring. Wellbeing should be directed towards getting things done in a collaborative setup.
Ask them if they’re doing this role/task. What if I’m doing it on my own time/expense. 

Mohammed Alafifi - 
When we talk about stress we think it should be more for the smaller companies. It’s interesting that it’s larger for the larger organizations.
It’s easier to work with and help adapt the culture in smaller companies.

Aya JYIF - 46% of the causes of stress is the workload 28% other - family/social life.
Work is the main cause of stress worldwide
300 billion dollars of losses - absenteeism 
Financial Costs of Job Stress | CPH-NEW | ResearchUniversity of Massachusetts Lowellhttps://www.uml.edu › ... › Stress@Work

Managers have a responsibility - AND - individuals have a responsibility 
Lots of factors managers can work
We must focus on the human side - 
There are a lot of benefits - If this is what it takes to convince employers to consider wellbeing

Bilal Question: **Startups and our early stage entrepreneurs - (including myself) - how do I allow myself to rest and have a balanced day with family / break / and work while still making sure the company doesn’t collapse.

You need to sett the boundaries … you need to say that to your self 1st, you are important as much as the team … you are important as much as the enterprise ! if you collapse the team will collaps as well, and so the enterprise ! 
You set boundaries … set the list of priorities on your agenda ( your agenda is your fram work! Its, your road toward your goal); get to say NO, you can’t please all people arround ! have a clear working hours ! (from 9am to 5pm per exemple ) ….  

Rim: How do you set boundaries?
Participants might call in the evening, calls/emails, etc. 
All teams are in an emergency state - they have 100000 tasks and your response is needed IMMEDIATELY. 
Make boundaries and set it so it’s clear that we’re available only during workhours. 

Other team members shouldn’t interrupt during break days. 
BG: How do you set boundaries when we may be understaffed/underresourced? 
Rim: Sometimes we have to.. We establish a support system. 
Whenever you’re free you can rest. When there’s rush time-rush, and when you can rest you can rest. 
Rim: Support each other across departments. 

Mohammed/Layla: Agency really cares about the wellbeing of their staff. We are FORCED to take days off. Contractors are paid by hour and the organization pushes people to take time off.

We are two of us. We don’t overload ourselves. We have a wheel of life chart 

IQ - Intelligence quotient
EQ - Emotional quotient 
BQ - Body quotient 
SQ - spiritual quotient 

Sometimes we have to GO TO THE BEACH with our two little girls. 

This is a great sign of how to influence culture!

Mohammed/Layal: Checkin channel - some people come in and say “I don’t feel well, I can’t work today.” 

Dara: Bloom takes a break twice a week a year so EVERYONE is off at the same time. That way it really helps people really relax because there is no work that’s “piled up” when people come back 
We can checkin with our whole self. 
Cosmic Centaurs Blueprint for an Intentional Summer

DMN: Reflecting is not a takeaway from work time. It’s an enabler for effective work time.
We are all the entrepreneur of our own lives. Make the smart decisions over short/medium/long to go towards the direction we want to go is critical.  
When you’re a founder, you have an effect on other people’s lives as well. Good decisions on prioritization is really important. We only have 24 hours a day. 


Aya: 
Work/life balance - impressive. We have to remind ourselves to speak up. 
Sometimes managers just DON’T KNOW - d


Once you know the vision / purpose of what you’re doing - it helps with feeling fine/comfortable because your vision is aligned.

Consider personal/professional goals. What about personal development goals? 
What do //you// desire to learn to develop in terms of skills. 

Universal Skills? Public speaking skills. I want to keep learning - my own 

Mohammed and Layal: Reflection quote: "I am not who you think I am; I am not who I think I am; I am who I think you think I am"

How does this relate to how we design our entrepreneurial programs? 

When you understand yourself and see how you are a part of the systems you’re a part of helps you act skillfully. 

Peter Abdel Karim: Entrepreneur, a part of many programs, digital marketing/graphic design/many hats.

From my learning journey. Being in a supportive community / learning from others / hear from other people’s feedback. <3 working with people who give constructive feedback.


Essentialism - The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown

The businessman and the fisherman - The Storytellers

Layal: All of my favorite projects were probono projects, causes were amazing. Made by people who can’t afford to do it. Yet they were the projects I LOVED the most. 
Makes you feel good to know you’re working for a cause that’s contributing to a community. Sometimes it’s much better than being paid a ton that you don’t enjoy or doesn’t do any good. 

What if we can do more of the ones that align most with our values. 
So cool to not pass on. Put their heart in. 

BG: Values - Creating values - Exchanging values - Creating economies. 

Mohammed Sikka: Values and Beliefs - we need to talk about this.

Bilal answers questions about challenges and needs: What are your top three personal and professional learning goals at this stage in your career? How would you describe your current strengths and areas for improvement? Which aspects of Bloom.pm's growth and development are you most directly involved in or responsible for? What are the main challenges or obstacles you and Bloom.pm are currently facing? How do you see your role evolving within Bloom.pm in the near future? Are there any specific skills or knowledge areas you'd like to develop further to enhance your contributions to Bloom.pm? Based on your assessment results and the information provided so far, which activities from the list resonate the most with you and why? Do you have any preferences for the type of learning activity, such as reading, workshops, or online courses? 1) I would like to become more of an expert in something rather than a generalist. I feel like I'm all over the place and I have a hard time being seen as a professional both for my own self image and externally. I need to make more money as. my wife is pregnant and we'll need to manage larger expenses. Professional learning, I would like to learn transferrable skills that make me competitive in the job market while also being a rockstar at my own organization, Bloom. 2) I'm nerdy, great at research, I get lost on questions when they capture me like how should I use ChatGPT for work. And I ignore lots of important things that don't, which is a weakness. 3. I am responsible at Bloom for our curriculum and training. I'm a facilitator of a new program. I am also attempting to identify new program styles that we can run faster and for different audiences. We run training programs that use assessments and libraries of interventions to help people grow personally and professionally. If you have ideas about how to use chat GPT in that instance, give me a prompt showing that. 4. obstacles are that we need more clients, we are a nonprofit accelerator and our budgets are capped and we have a small amount of overhead for creativity, well-being activities at work, etc. We want corporate clients, or to sell the software we're making 5. I see myself stabilizing the organization and being focused on research, creative work, values alignment, working on new financial models to support social enterprises, new program design to bring those financial models to life, etc. 6. I want to learn more about economics and human values and international policy. I wonder if we can have a beautiful future of people living their values at work and also have the sort of scalable growth we have. Lots of question about meaning and money and life and death. 7. I'm interested in practical things I can do that involve others, reading a book or doing an activity alone won't captivate me. I should do something where we can work together - perhaps online on a zoom call that will help me share my research and also help the team connect and overcome my problem of procrastination and continual research by allowing myself to work with people who have a different mindset, the fishing sort of mindset that turns ideas into done. That's the problem I'm facing, how to stop innovating and get things to done, especially get things to done that we can sell. I'm also scared to call people - that fear leads to procrastination. 8. I prefer online courses and activities with great facilitation around areas I'm interested in. I also have a problem where I love reading yet I don't take good enough notes and even if I do I don't know how to turn notes into productive action for Bloom.

Avery answers: What specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process? Answer: I think that Bilal should work on qualitative analysis concepts so that he can guide Bloom's data collection and research efforts towards more actionable data outcomes. I think collaborating with our new M&E expert and taking on small data visualization projects would help him work towards this goal. Are there any challenges or opportunities within Bloom where you think Bilal’s strengths and expertise could be particularly valuable, and what actions should he take to address them? Answer: Bilal's emerging expertise with GPT and AI tools could help Bloom jump ahead of competitors. He should have space and support to implement new tools when possible.

Answer: Bilal works best in conversation with other people, and he is inspired by experts and people who have thought deeply about subjects.

Bloom colleague, Dara, answering questions about Bilal: Questions: What specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process? Are there any challenges or opportunities within Bloom where you think Bilal’s strengths and expertise could be particularly valuable, and what actions should he take to address them? Based on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth? Dara short profile: Dara, programs lead, sanguine personality, deep thinker, she was Bilal's previous mentee, the organized person creating lots of documentation and better at time management Dara's answers: Data analysis and research skills: We’ve been doing this in a bit of an ad-hoc way, and now, with Ghina’s skills and your brains (specifically imagination, ability to think abstractly and connect the dots in the bigger picture, and how you leverage technology), we can take it to the next level, and that can feed into our experiments and help us develop case studies, publish research, etc. This can also be a great combo because China is methodical and systematic and can help organize your experiments. Having you lead more scientifically designed research more systematically and consistently can help us identify more effective ways to develop our programs and be more responsive to the needs of participants. This also makes sense because you’re always the first to share and distill external research so we can try new things. And it puts you back on the conference trail: as we publish more, you can go around and present findings, leading to more projects. Based on my experience working with you, I know you enjoy exploring new ideas and experimenting with new approaches. I also know that you think better in dialogue. So you may benefit from having a research buddy (Ghina) and an experimentation buddy (me and the PMs) to help put things into the action.

Answers by Habib: What specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process? Being Realistic (in the sense of what could be achieved and at what level) Planning Are there any challenges or opportunities within Bloom where you think Bilal’s strengths and expertise could be particularly valuable, and what actions should he take to address them? Yes, helping everyone staying aligned on the core value of what we are doing. Bilal = Compass. (leading the towards the core value) I’m thinking, how would improving your planning skill and your being realistic skill would affect this role. How much when we are drawn to the plan and to the reality would prevent us from focusing on the core? V/S how much when we are too much focused on the core value would keep us stuck in a loop of iteration. Sounds like we have some interesting material to discuss. Based on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth? Getting busy with new ideas and work with people directly.

Time management

2.

Bilal is great at public speaking. Would be great if he can present Bloom more to the public to increase our visibility and access to opportunities.

When it comes to the tech side of our work, Bilal is a master in that. It would be helpful for the team if Bilal could document his knowledge on how to best utilize the different tools, and how they're connected to each others. So that can be a reference doc for the team.

3\. I feel that Bilal is busy most of the time, so what would be most efficient and effective for him is to have a mentor supporting him on the areas/skills he wants to master. In addition to self learning.

Data analysis and research skills: We’ve been doing this in a bit of an ad-hoc way, and now, with Ghina’s skills and your brains (specifically imagination, ability to think abstractly and connect the dots in the bigger picture, and how you leverage technology), we can take it to the next level, and that can feed into our experiments and help us develop case studies, publish research, etc. This can also be a great combo because China is methodical and systematic and can help organize your experiments.

> Pick from the following list of activities available, identify those that align with the identified growth areas, strengths, and interests of the individual. The activities should cater to the individual's preferences and learning style, as well as their specific areas of interest such as research, technology, economics, and human values.

For Bilal, consider activities that involve mentorship or coaching, team-based learning and projects, developing research and technology skills, improving time management and follow-through, and increasing cross-team collaboration. The activities should also be adaptable to suit Bilal's specific needs and preferences.

For example, if an activity involves reading a book or watching a movie, ensure that the content aligns with Bilal's interests and can contribute to his growth areas. If an activity involves a business process or a module, ensure that it can help Bilal develop his professional skills and capacities.

🤔 Think about three key messages or subjects that you would like to talk about

with your customers.

A “subject” is not one post idea; it’s something you can build many posts on.

Some examples include:

🍼 Suppose I sell baby products, then one of my post subjects would be giving

parenting tips.

🌹 Suppose I sell plants and flowers, then one of the subjects would be how to

take care of a plant, or DIY flower arrangements.

What post “themes” or “subjects” can you think of that you feel would add

value to your community?

🌻 What are the different types of HR policies that are necessary for a healthy

workplace?

🌻 What is something that surprises you? Anything you hadn't thought of before?

Take notes! Reflecting on this material will help you build a strong HR

foundation ⚒️

Welcome to the last session with Andre! Practice these tips before your pitch

day. If you are able to do all these things, you will be relaxed, and your

audience will be able to connect with you as if you are pitching face-to-face.

As you watch, ask yourself:

🌻 What is one tip Andre gave that is new to you?

🌻 Which video platform (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, etc.) are you most

comfortable using? Which should you be more prepared for? How are they

different?

\## Let's get started!

It's time to create a Cultural Fit Assessment for your company 🥳 Many samples

are available online, however, it is key that this document reflect your own

unique culture.

1\\. Now that your values are clear, write 3 behaviors that support each value

(must be an action sentence). For example:

Value: Social Awareness

Behavior 1: Analyze the internal and external social environment before taking

action.

2\\. Draft a culture fit questionnaire encompassing not more than 10 questions

(you can add more questions later).

Make sure you cover the 2 parts we discussed in the video:

\* Questions to bring personal values and behaviors to the surface.

\* Questions to benchmark and assess alignment with the core values of the organization.

🙌 Great work! Save this document with your team's HR library. When the time

comes to recruit new team members, incorporate it into your interview process.

🎓 Training Activity 3: Highly Performing Team Dynamics & Development

\## Welcome!

Welcome to the final 🎓 Training Activity with Christine Francis! This activity

will help you understand the different stages of team culture and the role of

a strong team culture in achieving your goals 🏆

👫 A highly performing team is a group of people who work together harmoniously

to achieve an outcome much bigger than the number of people on the team if

they were to work individually. Direction is key to clarity, alignment is what

makes the team coherent, and commitment is what ensures success. The diversity

of the team members is important when it comes to thinking, skills sets,

expertise, and points of view. Diversity fuels innovation, but values and

cultural fit are key components of a successful enterprise.

As you watch the video, consider these questions:

🌻 What are the four stages of the Tuckman Team Development Model?

🌻 What are the communication and strength profiles of your team?

🌻 What will it look like when your team starts "performing?"

\## Let's get started!

\## Explore some more...

\* \[discprofile.com\](https://www.discprofile.com/) offers a workplace personality profiling service.

\## Apply your knowledge!

The 4 key components of highly effective teams when it comes to performance

and results are:

1\. Shared values and clear vision of KPI’s - **The What**!

2\. Who are our team members? What are their roles? How do their roles link to KPIs? - **The Who!**

3\. What is the plan to execute or achieve your vision? - **The How!**

4\. What is the timeline, the phases, etc.? - **The When**!

Briefly reflect on each of these points, then continue onto the Worksheet

🎓 Training Activity 1: Structuring Your Program Team

\## Welcome!

This first activity of covers people operations for your program 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏻

This video will cover the following topics:

🌻 The things that motivate different types of members of accelerator teams and

how to assess if you can add activities to ensure that your team is well

motivated to achieve the company goals.

🌻 The company goals, the KPIs used to measure them, and how to ensure that

each is well looked after by well-assigned and communicated responsibilities.

🌻 How to use this knowledge as you make changes to your program so that

responsibilities and people are updated effectively.

Let's get started!

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737822995)

\## Explore some more...

Even though this list was created for Startup Weekend, this page contains a

great list of roles and responsibilities for accelerators as well - you can

use it as a starting point for your own list.

📝 As you fill it in, take note of any areas where you have difficulty filling

it in and why. This will help you initiate discussions with your team about

(creative and rewarding) ways to motivate your team members. It will also help

you distribute responsibilities among your team.

🎓 Training Activity 2: Collecting and Protecting Your Company Data

\## Welcome!

This activity covers processes related to gathering data for your accelerator

programs.

The EU has the most comprehensive and up-to-date regulations for data

compliance, so Anna's recommendations are based on these standards. However,

they can be adapted to any legal context with the help of a data compliance

expert. The topics include:

🌻 Why data matters to accelerator programs.

🌻 How to collect the right data for our needs.

🌻 Where and how to collect it and how to process it, including the

responsibilities of the person on your team who looks after your data

collection and protection process.

🌻 Further information about processing data, covering how to work with it in a

responsible and secure way.

📝 There's lots of valuable information here, so feel free to pause, take

notes, rewatch, or any other strategies that help you process.

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737823777)

\## Explore some more...

The actions stated in the EU's \[GDPR Checklist\](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/)

are the main things that a business needs to do in order to stay compliant.

Four important processes you need to have are:

\* The EU's \[Data Processing Agreement template\](https://gdpr.eu/data-processing-agreement/)

\* The EU’s \[template Privacy Policy\](https://gdpr.eu/privacy-notice/) for a website

\* Here is the EU’s \[advice on a Cookie Policy for a website\](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/), but they do not have a template. There are lots of companies today providing a service of being the pop-up on your website to deal with cookies permissions.

\* Here is a \[template of a GDPR register\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U71Qwtvt3gqXJUl3XvRkm9Wy28cSiRxo5f9V2farldo/edit?usp=sharing), which should be updated regularly in order to remain compliant with GDPR law. This template is only a guideline and should be checked with a local legal advisor before being implemented.

With these four things - a Data Protection Agreement, a Privacy Policy, a

Cookie Policy, and a GDPR Register - you are making good progress toward being

GDPR compliant. In all of your agreements, you should make sure that you add a

GDPR clause, but for this, you will need to seek local legal advice. Just ask

a local expert or data lawyer for the appropriate paragraphs to add.

\## Apply your knowledge!

Using \[this

spreadsheet\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TCEMeP2iYcVpM9\_u221xlURHdWIudueY6dm9UsewtLY/edit?usp=sharing),

make a list of what kind of digital data you currently collect and what other

data you want to collect and why.

Share this list with other accelerators to see what data they think is

important to collect and why. Discuss together the challenges of collecting

data and how to overcome these challenges.

Finally, complete this \[example Risk & Asset

Register\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-fqQhL2Z8UGahiiQS\_gUUFfkkLhFCiCrYw71Z-Huj8E/edit?usp=sharing)

🎓 Training Activity 3: Building a Responsible and Sustainable Program

\## Welcome!

This final video will help you run your program responsibly and sustainably -

legal policies, financial processes, and, since many people think that these

are the ‘non-exciting parts’ of accelerators, how to set the right attitude

when working in these areas.

Anna will guide you through the following topics:

🌻 The legal agreements and policies that you should consider having and how to

make them applicable to your team.

🌻 Meetings and ways of working that will help you keep on top of your

financials.

🌻 Looking at the bold idea of publicizing all your efforts and how this can

positively impact your program.

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737824322)

\## Explore some more...

Here are some recommended resources from Anna:

\* \[How to outsource some of your HR obligations\](https://www.gan.co/blog/hiring-remote-employees-hard/) to focus your energy on what you do well.

\* Workable has \[this resource\](https://resources.workable.com/employee-handbook-policies) to help create an employee handbook and accompanying policies.

\* Here is \[a nice article about great examples of Employee Handbooks\](https://blog.airmason.com/the-10-best-employee-handbook-examples/).

\## Apply your knowledge!

This video has a lot of small tips in it, with lots of things to research and

check. Security and financial processes can seem urgent, but you only have

limited time to dedicate to these details. So, create a checklist and

prioritize the list.

📝 Here is \[a template

checklist\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/135mxucH7FmGHoAjl0RV1dqejAVynMz58Q7XJoAu7Mv0/edit?usp=sharing)

of things you should do to attain good compliance. Use this checklist to see

what you have already completed, have not finalized, or have not even thought

about! Create a list of your top 3 priorities to complete this month. You can

discuss with your colleagues what they think are the high-priority items.

If a document is referred to here, but a template has not been provided,

either this is because you should seek local advice. Health and safety laws,

employment laws, and IT security laws differ greatly from region to region.

report/) of a survey covering 128 accelerators spread across more than a

hundred cities and six continents. The full report is available to subscribed

members, but the public version also has valuable information and statistics.

applications, so this should be remembered when setting your communications

plan targets.

Pick one of the Communications activities you filled into the first tab in the

previous activity in the Marketing Campaign Planner document.

🚀 Start to fill in the following tabs:

Goal tab, Plan Overview, and Budget for the chosen campaign.

🎓 Training Activity 3: Growth Hacking Mindset

\## Welcome!

Now you have a landing page and the right tools to drive and convert traffic,

it's time to think about your marketing strategy as a whole, and this begins

with some creative thinking. The modern entrepreneurs of today are able to

push their thinking beyond traditional methods (e.g. the usual Facebook post

or a simple Google display ad) and find ways of truly maximizing both budget

and effort. And the primary way to do this? Testing and experimentation 🔬

In this video, Rayan introduces the 'Growth Hacking Mindset', what it is, how

it compares to traditional digital marketing, and how to use testing and

optimization to drive more sales/acquisitions this month than you did last

month, and even more next month than you'll do this month - all by applying

the growth hacking mindset to your business 📈

your landing page.

These can be:

🌻 Headline tests

🌻 Image tests

🌻 Call-to-action tests

🌻 Any other test that will improve the performance of your page.

You will need to justify why you have chosen these tests, what specifically

you'll be testing, and why you think that will improve conversion rates.

🎓 Training Activity 1: Advocacy Strategy

\## Welcome!

Welcome to the first 🎓 Training Activity of the Advocacy Module, taught by

Thomas Strodtbeck.

This activity reviews the components of an advocacy strategy, how advocacy is

part of an accelerator's overall communication strategy, and how to align

advocacy efforts to the overall goals of the accelerator.

As you watch the video, consider the following questions:

🌻 Does my accelerator have a clearly defined advocacy strategy?

🌻 What are the overall goals of the accelerator? How could advocacy help your

reach those goals?

🏊🏽 Let's dive in!

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737838554)

\## Explore some more...

Resources located in Activity 3

\## Apply your knowledge!

In this Action, you will examine organizations and initiatives in your

ecosystem whose goals and objectives may align with your accelerator.

1\\. First, list your key programmatic outcomes as defined by your KPIs or

OKRs, and the indicators that support these outcomes.

2\\. Thinking about your community, list both the initiatives (i.e. a startup

program for women founders, or a program to encourage STEM education) and the

organizations (i.e. other accelerators, incubators, universities, and

government agencies) whose own goals and outcomes align with your programs.

This list will be the starting point for future advocacy efforts, so make it

as comprehensive as you can. This is a brainstorming exercise 🧠 Involve your

team in the process!

🎓 Training Activity 2: Values Based Recruitment & Cultural Fit

\## Welcome!

What tools can you use to build a strong team culture?

Values based recruitment (VBR) is an approach to help attract and recruit

prospective employees whose personal values and behaviors align with those of

your organization. The best way to deliver VBR is through a Cultural Fit

Assessment.

As you watch the video, think about these questions:

🌻 What are your team's core values that will attract good candidates?

🌻 What are some sample interview questions that target your core values?

✍️ Take notes! It will help you complete the rest of the action.

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/546366033)

\## Explore some more...

\* \[This article\](https://www.aaronwallis.co.uk/candidates/advice/sales-interview-advice/how-to-wow-at-value-based-interview/) gives a candidate's perspective on VBR.

\* This is an \[in-depth article\](https://www.aihr.com/blog/cultural-fit-assessment/) about Cultural Fit Assessments.

\* \[This article\](https://www.jobtestprep.com/culture-fit-test-prep#:~:text=Examples%20of%20Culture,culture%20interview%20questions%3A) lists some sample Cultural Fit interview questions.

\## Apply your knowledge!

It's time to create a Cultural Fit Assessment for your company 🥳 Many samples

are available online, however, it is key that this document reflect your own

unique culture.

1\\. Now that your values are clear, write 3 behaviors that support each value

(must be an action sentence). For example:

Value: Social Awareness

Behavior 1: Analyze the internal and external social environment before taking

action.

2\\. Draft a culture fit questionnaire encompassing not more than 10 questions

(you can add more questions later).

Make sure you cover the 2 parts we discussed in the video:

\* Questions to bring personal values and behaviors to the surface.

\* Questions to benchmark and assess alignment with the core values of the organization.

🙌 Great work! Save this document with your team's HR library. When the time

comes to recruit new team members, incorporate it into your interview process.

🎓 Training Activity 3: Highly Performing Team Dynamics & Development

\## Welcome!

Welcome to the final 🎓 Training Activity with Christine Francis! This activity

will help you understand the different stages of team culture and the role of

a strong team culture in achieving your goals 🏆

👫 A highly performing team is a group of people who work together harmoniously

to achieve an outcome much bigger than the number of people on the team if

they were to work individually. Direction is key to clarity, alignment is what

makes the team coherent, and commitment is what ensures success. The diversity

of the team members is important when it comes to thinking, skills sets,

expertise, and points of view. Diversity fuels innovation, but values and

cultural fit are key components of a successful enterprise.

As you watch the video, consider these questions:

🌻 What are the four stages of the Tuckman Team Development Model?

🌻 What are the communication and strength profiles of your team?

🌻 What will it look like when your team starts "performing?"

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/546439139)

\## Explore some more...

\* \[discprofile.com\](https://www.discprofile.com/) offers a workplace personality profiling service.

\## Apply your knowledge!

The 4 key components of highly effective teams when it comes to performance

and results are:

1\. Shared values and clear vision of KPI’s - **The What**!

2\. Who are our team members? What are their roles? How do their roles link to KPIs? - **The Who!**

3\. What is the plan to execute or achieve your vision? - **The How!**

4\. What is the timeline, the phases, etc.? - **The When**!

Briefly reflect on each of these points, then continue onto the Worksheet

This video will cover the following topics:

🌻 The things that motivate different types of members of accelerator teams and

how to assess if you can add activities to ensure that your team is well

motivated to achieve the company goals.

🌻 The company goals, the KPIs used to measure them, and how to ensure that

each is well looked after by well-assigned and communicated responsibilities.

🌻 How to use this knowledge as you make changes to your program so that

responsibilities and people are updated effectively.

🎓 Training Activity 2: Collecting and Protecting Your Company Data

\## Welcome!

This activity covers processes related to gathering data for your accelerator

programs.

The EU has the most comprehensive and up-to-date regulations for data

compliance, so Anna's recommendations are based on these standards. However,

they can be adapted to any legal context with the help of a data compliance

expert. The topics include:

🌻 Why data matters to accelerator programs.

🌻 How to collect the right data for our needs.

🌻 Where and how to collect it and how to process it, including the

responsibilities of the person on your team who looks after your data

collection and protection process.

🌻 Further information about processing data, covering how to work with it in a

responsible and secure way.

📝 There's lots of valuable information here, so feel free to pause, take

notes, rewatch, or any other strategies that help you process.

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737823777)

\## Explore some more...

The actions stated in the EU's \[GDPR Checklist\](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/)

are the main things that a business needs to do in order to stay compliant.

Four important processes you need to have are:

\* The EU's \[Data Processing Agreement template\](https://gdpr.eu/data-processing-agreement/)

\* The EU’s \[template Privacy Policy\](https://gdpr.eu/privacy-notice/) for a website

\* Here is the EU’s \[advice on a Cookie Policy for a website\](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/), but they do not have a template. There are lots of companies today providing a service of being the pop-up on your website to deal with cookies permissions.

\* Here is a \[template of a GDPR register\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U71Qwtvt3gqXJUl3XvRkm9Wy28cSiRxo5f9V2farldo/edit?usp=sharing), which should be updated regularly in order to remain compliant with GDPR law. This template is only a guideline and should be checked with a local legal advisor before being implemented.

With these four things - a Data Protection Agreement, a Privacy Policy, a

Cookie Policy, and a GDPR Register - you are making good progress toward being

GDPR compliant. In all of your agreements, you should make sure that you add a

GDPR clause, but for this, you will need to seek local legal advice. Just ask

a local expert or data lawyer for the appropriate paragraphs to add.

\## Apply your knowledge!

Using \[this

spreadsheet\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TCEMeP2iYcVpM9\_u221xlURHdWIudueY6dm9UsewtLY/edit?usp=sharing),

make a list of what kind of digital data you currently collect and what other

data you want to collect and why.

Share this list with other accelerators to see what data they think is

important to collect and why. Discuss together the challenges of collecting

data and how to overcome these challenges.

Finally, complete this \[example Risk & Asset

Register\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-fqQhL2Z8UGahiiQS\_gUUFfkkLhFCiCrYw71Z-Huj8E/edit?usp=sharing)

🎓 Training Activity 3: Building a Responsible and Sustainable Program

\## Welcome!

This final video will help you run your program responsibly and sustainably -

legal policies, financial processes, and, since many people think that these

are the ‘non-exciting parts’ of accelerators, how to set the right attitude

when working in these areas.

Anna will guide you through the following topics:

🌻 The legal agreements and policies that you should consider having and how to

make them applicable to your team.

🌻 Meetings and ways of working that will help you keep on top of your

financials.

🌻 Looking at the bold idea of publicizing all your efforts and how this can

positively impact your program.

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737824322)

Here are some recommended resources from Anna:

\* Workable has \[this resource\](https://resources.workable.com/employee-handbook-policies) to help create an employee handbook and accompanying policies.

\* Here is \[a nice article about great examples of Employee Handbooks\](https://blog.airmason.com/the-10-best-employee-handbook-examples/).

\## Apply your knowledge!

This video has a lot of small tips in it, with lots of things to research and

check. Security and financial processes can seem urgent, but you only have

limited time to dedicate to these details. So, create a checklist and

prioritize the list.

📝 Here is \[a template

checklist\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/135mxucH7FmGHoAjl0RV1dqejAVynMz58Q7XJoAu7Mv0/edit?usp=sharing)

of things you should do to attain good compliance. Use this checklist to see

what you have already completed, have not finalized, or have not even thought

about! Create a list of your top 3 priorities to complete this month. You can

discuss with your colleagues what they think are the high-priority items.

If a document is referred to here, but a template has not been provided,

either this is because you should seek local advice. Health and safety laws,

employment laws, and IT security laws differ greatly from region to region.

two dogs often fight inside us. The one who wins the fight is the one you feed

the most.

Being positive doesn't just make you better. It makes everyone around you

better.

🎓 Training Activity 3: Growth Hacking Mindset

\## Welcome!

Now you have a landing page and the right tools to drive and convert traffic,

it's time to think about your marketing strategy as a whole, and this begins

with some creative thinking. The modern entrepreneurs of today are able to

push their thinking beyond traditional methods (e.g. the usual Facebook post

or a simple Google display ad) and find ways of truly maximizing both budget

and effort. And the primary way to do this? Testing and experimentation 🔬

In this video, Rayan introduces the 'Growth Hacking Mindset', what it is, how

it compares to traditional digital marketing, and how to use testing and

optimization to drive more sales/acquisitions this month than you did last

month, and even more next month than you'll do this month - all by applying

the growth hacking mindset to your business 📈

🎓 Training Activity 1: Advocacy Strategy

\## Welcome!

Welcome to the first 🎓 Training Activity of the Advocacy Module, taught by

Thomas Strodtbeck.

This activity reviews the components of an advocacy strategy, how advocacy is

part of an accelerator's overall communication strategy, and how to align

advocacy efforts to the overall goals of the accelerator.

As you watch the video, consider the following questions:

🌻 Does my accelerator have a clearly defined advocacy strategy?

🌻 What are the overall goals of the accelerator? How could advocacy help your

reach those goals?

🏊🏽 Let's dive in!

\## Apply your knowledge!

In this Action, you will examine organizations and initiatives in your

ecosystem whose goals and objectives may align with your accelerator.

1\\. First, list your key programmatic outcomes as defined by your KPIs or

OKRs, and the indicators that support these outcomes.

2\\. Thinking about your community, list both the initiatives (i.e. a startup

program for women founders, or a program to encourage STEM education) and the

organizations (i.e. other accelerators, incubators, universities, and

government agencies) whose own goals and outcomes align with your programs.

This list will be the starting point for future advocacy efforts, so make it

as comprehensive as you can. This is a brainstorming exercise 🧠 Involve your

team in the process!

live. I’m so tired. If only I could rest – I need rest! I’m the seagull – but

I’m not really. I’m an actress. Yes. (She hears Arkadina and Trigorin

laughing.) So he’s here, too…well, it doesn’t matter. He never believed in

theatre, he always laughed at me for my dreams of being famous, and bit by bit

I stopped believing, too, and lost heart…there were all the other things to

worry about – love, jealousy…and always the worry about the baby. I became

trivial and commonplace. My work lost all meaning. On stage I didn’t know what

to do with my hands or how to stand, I couldn’t control my voice…You can’t

know what it’s like when you’re up there feeling you’re acting so badly. The

seagull. No, that’s not me…you remember how you once shot that seagull? A man

happened to come along and see her, and having nothing much to do, destroyed

her. Idea for a short story… No, that’s not it … what was I saying? Oh yes,

about acting… I’m not like that anymore. I’ve become a real actress. I love

acting, when I’m on stage I feel drunk on the sheer joy of it, and I feel

beautiful. While I’ve been back here I’ve spent a lot of time walking and

thinking – and every day I’ve felt my spirit getting stronger. What I’ve

realized, Kostya, is that, with us, whether we’re writers or actors, what

really counts is not dreaming about fame and glory…but stamina: knowing how to

keep going despite everything, and having faith in yourself – I’ve got faith

in myself now and that’s helped the pain, and when I think to myself, "You’re

on the stage!’ then I’m not afraid of anything life can to do to me.

really counts is not dreaming about fame and glory…but stamina: knowing how to

keep going despite everything, and having faith in yourself – I’ve got faith

in myself now and that’s helped the pain, and when I think to myself, "You’re

on the stage!’ then I’m not afraid of anything life can to do to me.

\* !\[\](/assets/att1smxJGZXbXMLzF-Rapid\_Research\_Review\_More\_Study\_Types\_EMRA)

\## Welcome!

A simple exercise that complements exploratory, discursive, and creative

workshops with insights and opinions from outside. Use this exercise when

brainstorming ideas, developing a new product or service or creating a

ask them questions relevant to the task. This quickly generates meaningful

input from a range of “outside” perspectives. Often, participants will be

surprised at how simple it was to solicit this input and how valuable it is to

the process.

Dotmocracy is a simple method for group prioritization or decision-making. It

quickly see which options are most popular or relevant. The options or ideas

are written on post-its and stuck up on a wall for the whole group to see.

Each person votes for the options they think are the strongest, and that

information is used to inform a decision.

## 📝 🎬 Movie: As Good as it Gets (1997)
**Date**: 2023-05-15 | **Source**: claude

> Our goal is to craft the ideal 3 tasks for Bilal's Growth, we know this about bilal:

Based on the assessment results and information provided, here are some potential insights and recommendations for Bilal:

•Bilal seems particularly interested in developing expertise and mastery, especially around research and AI. Given his weaknesses in focus and prioritization, mentorship or coaching in a specific domain could be helpful. For example, collaborating with Ghina on research projects and skills could provide an opportunity for targeted learning and increased expertise.

•Bilal appears motivated by work that involves others and leads to tangible outcomes. Team-based learning or projects, especially those focused on turning ideas into action, may be most engaging and impactful for him. For example, collaborating with program managers on new program designs or financial models.

•Bilal's interests in research, technology, economics, and human values suggest some potential areas of growth for Bloom. Developing Bilal's capacities in these areas through further study and experimentation could lead to valuable innovation. At the same time, Bilal recognizes the need to stabilize the organization financially and improve time management, focus and prioritization. Mentorship, coaching and increased teamwork may help strengthen these skills which are crucial for Bloom's success.

•Online courses, workshops or activities involving dialogue and facilitation seem to suit Bilal's preferences well. However, without proper note-taking, synthesis and follow-through, the learning may not translate into outcomes. Additional support in implementing takeaways or accountability measures may be needed.

•There appear to be many opportunities for cross-team collaboration at Bloom based on the range of Bilal's interests, skills, and areas for improvement. In particular, increased collaboration with program managers, mentors, and the research team could lead to valuable co-learning, innovative program designs, and scalable solutions for Bloom. Fostering connections across teams may be an important step.

In summary, focused mentorship or coaching, team-based learning and projects, developing research and technology skills, improving time management and follow-through, and increasing cross-team collaboration seem like potentially high-impact areas of development for Bilal and Bloom overall based on the assessment results and information provided.

Given the list of activities appended below, identify those that align with the identified growth areas, strengths, and interests of the individual. The activities should cater to the individual's preferences and learning style, as well as their specific areas of interest such as research, technology, economics, and human values.

For Bilal, consider activities that involve mentorship or coaching, team-based learning and projects, developing research and technology skills, improving time management and follow-through, and increasing cross-team collaboration. The activities should also be adaptable to suit Bilal's specific needs and preferences.

For example, if an activity involves reading a book or watching a movie, ensure that the content aligns with Bilal's interests and can contribute to his growth areas. If an activity involves a business process or a module, ensure that it can help Bilal develop his professional skills and capacities.

Once the suitable activities are identified, modify them as necessary to ensure they are tailored to Bilal's needs and can effectively contribute to his personal and professional development."

Remember, the goal is to find activities that not only align with Bilal's interests and growth areas but also challenge him in a way that promotes learning and development.

parenting tips.

🌹 Suppose I sell plants and flowers, then one of the subjects would be how to

take care of a plant, or DIY flower arrangements.

🎓 Training Activity 2: Values Based Recruitment & Cultural Fit

\## Welcome!

What tools can you use to build a strong team culture?

Values based recruitment (VBR) is an approach to help attract and recruit

prospective employees whose personal values and behaviors align with those of

your organization. The best way to deliver VBR is through a Cultural Fit

Assessment.

As you watch the video, think about these questions:

🌻 What are your team's core values that will attract good candidates?

🌻 What are some sample interview questions that target your core values?

✍️ Take notes! It will help you complete the rest of the action.

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/546366033)

\## Explore some more...

\* \[This article\](https://www.aaronwallis.co.uk/candidates/advice/sales-interview-advice/how-to-wow-at-value-based-interview/) gives a candidate's perspective on VBR.

\* This is an \[in-depth article\](https://www.aihr.com/blog/cultural-fit-assessment/) about Cultural Fit Assessments.

\* \[This article\](https://www.jobtestprep.com/culture-fit-test-prep#:~:text=Examples%20of%20Culture,culture%20interview%20questions%3A) lists some sample Cultural Fit interview questions.

\## Apply your knowledge!

It's time to create a Cultural Fit Assessment for your company 🥳 Many samples

are available online, however, it is key that this document reflect your own

unique culture.

1\\. Now that your values are clear, write 3 behaviors that support each value

(must be an action sentence). For example:

Value: Social Awareness

Behavior 1: Analyze the internal and external social environment before taking

action.

2\\. Draft a culture fit questionnaire encompassing not more than 10 questions

(you can add more questions later).

Make sure you cover the 2 parts we discussed in the video:

\* Questions to bring personal values and behaviors to the surface.

\* Questions to benchmark and assess alignment with the core values of the organization.

🙌 Great work! Save this document with your team's HR library. When the time

comes to recruit new team members, incorporate it into your interview process.

🎓 Training Activity 3: Highly Performing Team Dynamics & Development

\## Welcome!

Welcome to the final 🎓 Training Activity with Christine Francis! This activity

will help you understand the different stages of team culture and the role of

a strong team culture in achieving your goals 🏆

👫 A highly performing team is a group of people who work together harmoniously

to achieve an outcome much bigger than the number of people on the team if

they were to work individually. Direction is key to clarity, alignment is what

makes the team coherent, and commitment is what ensures success. The diversity

of the team members is important when it comes to thinking, skills sets,

expertise, and points of view. Diversity fuels innovation, but values and

cultural fit are key components of a successful enterprise.

As you watch the video, consider these questions:

🌻 What are the four stages of the Tuckman Team Development Model?

🌻 What are the communication and strength profiles of your team?

🌻 What will it look like when your team starts "performing?"

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/546439139)

\## Explore some more...

\* \[discprofile.com\](https://www.discprofile.com/) offers a workplace personality profiling service.

\## Apply your knowledge!

The 4 key components of highly effective teams when it comes to performance

and results are:

1\. Shared values and clear vision of KPI’s - **The What**!

2\. Who are our team members? What are their roles? How do their roles link to KPIs? - **The Who!**

3\. What is the plan to execute or achieve your vision? - **The How!**

4\. What is the timeline, the phases, etc.? - **The When**!

Briefly reflect on each of these points, then continue onto the Worksheet

This video will cover the following topics:

🌻 The things that motivate different types of members of accelerator teams and

how to assess if you can add activities to ensure that your team is well

motivated to achieve the company goals.

🌻 The company goals, the KPIs used to measure them, and how to ensure that

each is well looked after by well-assigned and communicated responsibilities.

🌻 How to use this knowledge as you make changes to your program so that

responsibilities and people are updated effectively.

🎓 Training Activity 2: Collecting and Protecting Your Company Data

\## Welcome!

This activity covers processes related to gathering data for your accelerator

programs.

The EU has the most comprehensive and up-to-date regulations for data

compliance, so Anna's recommendations are based on these standards. However,

they can be adapted to any legal context with the help of a data compliance

expert. The topics include:

🌻 Why data matters to accelerator programs.

🌻 How to collect the right data for our needs.

🌻 Where and how to collect it and how to process it, including the

responsibilities of the person on your team who looks after your data

collection and protection process.

🌻 Further information about processing data, covering how to work with it in a

responsible and secure way.

📝 There's lots of valuable information here, so feel free to pause, take

notes, rewatch, or any other strategies that help you process.

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737823777)

\## Explore some more...

The actions stated in the EU's \[GDPR Checklist\](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/)

are the main things that a business needs to do in order to stay compliant.

Four important processes you need to have are:

\* The EU's \[Data Processing Agreement template\](https://gdpr.eu/data-processing-agreement/)

\* The EU’s \[template Privacy Policy\](https://gdpr.eu/privacy-notice/) for a website

\* Here is the EU’s \[advice on a Cookie Policy for a website\](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/), but they do not have a template. There are lots of companies today providing a service of being the pop-up on your website to deal with cookies permissions.

\* Here is a \[template of a GDPR register\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U71Qwtvt3gqXJUl3XvRkm9Wy28cSiRxo5f9V2farldo/edit?usp=sharing), which should be updated regularly in order to remain compliant with GDPR law. This template is only a guideline and should be checked with a local legal advisor before being implemented.

With these four things - a Data Protection Agreement, a Privacy Policy, a

Cookie Policy, and a GDPR Register - you are making good progress toward being

GDPR compliant. In all of your agreements, you should make sure that you add a

GDPR clause, but for this, you will need to seek local legal advice. Just ask

a local expert or data lawyer for the appropriate paragraphs to add.

\## Apply your knowledge!

Using \[this

spreadsheet\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TCEMeP2iYcVpM9\_u221xlURHdWIudueY6dm9UsewtLY/edit?usp=sharing),

make a list of what kind of digital data you currently collect and what other

data you want to collect and why.

Share this list with other accelerators to see what data they think is

important to collect and why. Discuss together the challenges of collecting

data and how to overcome these challenges.

Finally, complete this \[example Risk & Asset

Register\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-fqQhL2Z8UGahiiQS\_gUUFfkkLhFCiCrYw71Z-Huj8E/edit?usp=sharing)

🎓 Training Activity 3: Building a Responsible and Sustainable Program

\## Welcome!

This final video will help you run your program responsibly and sustainably -

legal policies, financial processes, and, since many people think that these

are the ‘non-exciting parts’ of accelerators, how to set the right attitude

when working in these areas.

Anna will guide you through the following topics:

🌻 The legal agreements and policies that you should consider having and how to

make them applicable to your team.

🌻 Meetings and ways of working that will help you keep on top of your

financials.

🌻 Looking at the bold idea of publicizing all your efforts and how this can

positively impact your program.

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737824322)

\## Explore some more...

Here are some recommended resources from Anna:

\* \[How to outsource some of your HR obligations\](https://www.gan.co/blog/hiring-remote-employees-hard/) to focus your energy on what you do well.

\* Workable has \[this resource\](https://resources.workable.com/employee-handbook-policies) to help create an employee handbook and accompanying policies.

\* Here is \[a nice article about great examples of Employee Handbooks\](https://blog.airmason.com/the-10-best-employee-handbook-examples/).

\## Apply your knowledge!

This video has a lot of small tips in it, with lots of things to research and

check. Security and financial processes can seem urgent, but you only have

limited time to dedicate to these details. So, create a checklist and

prioritize the list.

📝 Here is \[a template

checklist\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/135mxucH7FmGHoAjl0RV1dqejAVynMz58Q7XJoAu7Mv0/edit?usp=sharing)

of things you should do to attain good compliance. Use this checklist to see

what you have already completed, have not finalized, or have not even thought

about! Create a list of your top 3 priorities to complete this month. You can

discuss with your colleagues what they think are the high-priority items.

If a document is referred to here, but a template has not been provided,

either this is because you should seek local advice. Health and safety laws,

employment laws, and IT security laws differ greatly from region to region.

hundred cities and six continents. The full report is available to subscribed

🎓 Training Activity 3: Growth Hacking Mindset

\## Welcome!

Now you have a landing page and the right tools to drive and convert traffic,

it's time to think about your marketing strategy as a whole, and this begins

with some creative thinking. The modern entrepreneurs of today are able to

push their thinking beyond traditional methods (e.g. the usual Facebook post

or a simple Google display ad) and find ways of truly maximizing both budget

and effort. And the primary way to do this? Testing and experimentation 🔬

In this video, Rayan introduces the 'Growth Hacking Mindset', what it is, how

it compares to traditional digital marketing, and how to use testing and

optimization to drive more sales/acquisitions this month than you did last

month, and even more next month than you'll do this month - all by applying

the growth hacking mindset to your business 📈

🎓 Training Activity 1: Advocacy Strategy

\## Welcome!

Welcome to the first 🎓 Training Activity of the Advocacy Module, taught by

Thomas Strodtbeck.

This activity reviews the components of an advocacy strategy, how advocacy is

part of an accelerator's overall communication strategy, and how to align

advocacy efforts to the overall goals of the accelerator.

As you watch the video, consider the following questions:

🌻 Does my accelerator have a clearly defined advocacy strategy?

🌻 What are the overall goals of the accelerator? How could advocacy help your

reach those goals?

🏊🏽 Let's dive in!

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737838554)

\## Explore some more...

Resources located in Activity 3

\## Apply your knowledge!

In this Action, you will examine organizations and initiatives in your

ecosystem whose goals and objectives may align with your accelerator.

1\\. First, list your key programmatic outcomes as defined by your KPIs or

OKRs, and the indicators that support these outcomes.

2\\. Thinking about your community, list both the initiatives (i.e. a startup

program for women founders, or a program to encourage STEM education) and the

organizations (i.e. other accelerators, incubators, universities, and

government agencies) whose own goals and outcomes align with your programs.

This list will be the starting point for future advocacy efforts, so make it

as comprehensive as you can. This is a brainstorming exercise 🧠 Involve your

team in the process!

I’m not really. I’m an actress. Yes. (She hears Arkadina and Trigorin

laughing.) So he’s here, too…well, it doesn’t matter. He never believed in

theatre, he always laughed at me for my dreams of being famous, and bit by bit

I stopped believing, too, and lost heart…there were all the other things to

worry about – love, jealousy…and always the worry about the baby. I became

trivial and commonplace. My work lost all meaning. On stage I didn’t know what

to do with my hands or how to stand, I couldn’t control my voice…You can’t

know what it’s like when you’re up there feeling you’re acting so badly. The

seagull. No, that’s not me…you remember how you once shot that seagull? A man

happened to come along and see her, and having nothing much to do, destroyed

her. Idea for a short story… No, that’s not it … what was I saying? Oh yes,

about acting… I’m not like that anymore. I’ve become a real actress. I love

acting, when I’m on stage I feel drunk on the sheer joy of it, and I feel

beautiful. While I’ve been back here I’ve spent a lot of time walking and

thinking – and every day I’ve felt my spirit getting stronger. What I’ve

realized, Kostya, is that, with us, whether we’re writers or actors, what

really counts is not dreaming about fame and glory…but stamina: knowing how to

keep going despite everything, and having faith in yourself – I’ve got faith

in myself now and that’s helped the pain, and when I think to myself, "You’re

\## Welcome!

Dotmocracy is a simple method for group prioritization or decision-making. It

is not an activity on its own, but a method to use in processes where

prioritization or decision-making is the aim. The method supports a group to

quickly see which options are most popular or relevant. The options or ideas

are written on post-its and stuck up on a wall for the whole group to see.

Each person votes for the options they think are the strongest, and that

information is used to inform a decision.

🎓 Training Activity 2: Values Based Recruitment & Cultural Fit

\## Welcome!

What tools can you use to build a strong team culture?

Values based recruitment (VBR) is an approach to help attract and recruit

prospective employees whose personal values and behaviors align with those of

your organization. The best way to deliver VBR is through a Cultural Fit

Assessment.

As you watch the video, think about these questions:

🌻 What are your team's core values that will attract good candidates?

🌻 What are some sample interview questions that target your core values?

✍️ Take notes! It will help you complete the rest of the action.

\* \[This article\](https://www.jobtestprep.com/culture-fit-test-prep#:~:text=Examples%20of%20Culture,culture%20interview%20questions%3A) lists some sample Cultural Fit interview questions.

\## Apply your knowledge!

It's time to create a Cultural Fit Assessment for your company 🥳 Many samples

are available online, however, it is key that this document reflect your own

unique culture.

1\\. Now that your values are clear, write 3 behaviors that support each value

(must be an action sentence). For example:

Value: Social Awareness

Behavior 1: Analyze the internal and external social environment before taking

action.

2\\. Draft a culture fit questionnaire encompassing not more than 10 questions

(you can add more questions later).

Make sure you cover the 2 parts we discussed in the video:

\* Questions to bring personal values and behaviors to the surface.

\* Questions to benchmark and assess alignment with the core values of the organization.

🙌 Great work! Save this document with your team's HR library. When the time

comes to recruit new team members, incorporate it into your interview process.

🎓 Training Activity 3: Highly Performing Team Dynamics & Development

\## Welcome!

Welcome to the final 🎓 Training Activity with Christine Francis! This activity

will help you understand the different stages of team culture and the role of

a strong team culture in achieving your goals 🏆

👫 A highly performing team is a group of people who work together harmoniously

to achieve an outcome much bigger than the number of people on the team if

they were to work individually. Direction is key to clarity, alignment is what

makes the team coherent, and commitment is what ensures success. The diversity

of the team members is important when it comes to thinking, skills sets,

expertise, and points of view. Diversity fuels innovation, but values and

cultural fit are key components of a successful enterprise.

As you watch the video, consider these questions:

🌻 What are the four stages of the Tuckman Team Development Model?

🌻 What are the communication and strength profiles of your team?

🌻 What will it look like when your team starts "performing?"

\## Let's get started!

\## Apply your knowledge!

The 4 key components of highly effective teams when it comes to performance

and results are:

1\. Shared values and clear vision of KPI’s - **The What**!

2\. Who are our team members? What are their roles? How do their roles link to KPIs? - **The Who!**

3\. What is the plan to execute or achieve your vision? - **The How!**

4\. What is the timeline, the phases, etc.? - **The When**!

\## Welcome!

This activity covers processes related to gathering data for your accelerator

programs.

The EU has the most comprehensive and up-to-date regulations for data

compliance, so Anna's recommendations are based on these standards. However,

they can be adapted to any legal context with the help of a data compliance

expert. The topics include:

🌻 Why data matters to accelerator programs.

🌻 How to collect the right data for our needs.

🌻 Where and how to collect it and how to process it, including the

responsibilities of the person on your team who looks after your data

collection and protection process.

🌻 Further information about processing data, covering how to work with it in a

responsible and secure way.

📝 There's lots of valuable information here, so feel free to pause, take

The actions stated in the EU's \[GDPR Checklist\](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/)

are the main things that a business needs to do in order to stay compliant.

Four important processes you need to have are:

\* The EU's \[Data Processing Agreement template\](https://gdpr.eu/data-processing-agreement/)

\* The EU’s \[template Privacy Policy\](https://gdpr.eu/privacy-notice/) for a website

\* Here is the EU’s \[advice on a Cookie Policy for a website\](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/), but they do not have a template. There are lots of companies today providing a service of being the pop-up on your website to deal with cookies permissions.

\* Here is a \[template of a GDPR register\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U71Qwtvt3gqXJUl3XvRkm9Wy28cSiRxo5f9V2farldo/edit?usp=sharing), which should be updated regularly in order to remain compliant with GDPR law. This template is only a guideline and should be checked with a local legal advisor before being implemented.

With these four things - a Data Protection Agreement, a Privacy Policy, a

Cookie Policy, and a GDPR Register - you are making good progress toward being

GDPR compliant. In all of your agreements, you should make sure that you add a

GDPR clause, but for this, you will need to seek local legal advice. Just ask

a local expert or data lawyer for the appropriate paragraphs to add.

\## Apply your knowledge!

Using \[this

spreadsheet\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TCEMeP2iYcVpM9\_u221xlURHdWIudueY6dm9UsewtLY/edit?usp=sharing),

make a list of what kind of digital data you currently collect and what other

data you want to collect and why.

Share this list with other accelerators to see what data they think is

important to collect and why. Discuss together the challenges of collecting

data and how to overcome these challenges.

Finally, complete this \[example Risk & Asset

Register\](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-fqQhL2Z8UGahiiQS\_gUUFfkkLhFCiCrYw71Z-Huj8E/edit?usp=sharing)

Thomlinson. The goal of this module is to build a stable foundation for your

accelerator program's sustainability and growth.

This series of three videos will enable you to build a good structure for your

🎓 Training Activity 3: Building a Responsible and Sustainable Program

\## Welcome!

This final video will help you run your program responsibly and sustainably -

legal policies, financial processes, and, since many people think that these

are the ‘non-exciting parts’ of accelerators, how to set the right attitude

when working in these areas.

Anna will guide you through the following topics:

🌻 The legal agreements and policies that you should consider having and how to

make them applicable to your team.

🌻 Meetings and ways of working that will help you keep on top of your

financials.

🌻 Looking at the bold idea of publicizing all your efforts and how this can

positively impact your program.

\## Let's get started!

\[🎬 Watch the video here\](https://vimeo.com/737824322)

\## Explore some more...

Here are some recommended resources from Anna:

\* \[How to outsource some of your HR obligations\](https://www.gan.co/blog/hiring-remote-employees-hard/) to focus your energy on what you do well.

\* Workable has \[this resource\](https://resources.workable.com/employee-handbook-policies) to help create an employee handbook and accompanying policies.

\* Here is \[a nice article about great examples of Employee Handbooks\](https://blog.airmason.com/the-10-best-employee-handbook-examples/).

\## Apply your knowledge!

This video has a lot of small tips in it, with lots of things to research and

check. Security and financial processes can seem urgent, but you only have

limited time to dedicate to these details. So, create a checklist and

prioritize the list.

📝 Here is \[a template

checklist\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/135mxucH7FmGHoAjl0RV1dqejAVynMz58Q7XJoAu7Mv0/edit?usp=sharing)

of things you should do to attain good compliance. Use this checklist to see

what you have already completed, have not finalized, or have not even thought

about! Create a list of your top 3 priorities to complete this month. You can

discuss with your colleagues what they think are the high-priority items.

If a document is referred to here, but a template has not been provided,

either this is because you should seek local advice. Health and safety laws,

employment laws, and IT security laws differ greatly from region to region.

explain this tool and start using it.

🚀 Use this meeting to **agree on your goals** and the types of marketing that

you will adopt.

🚀 Using the previous document, **fill in the actions** as much as possible and

agree on what you need to research before starting that campaign.

🎓 Training Activity 3: Growth Hacking Mindset

\## Welcome!

Now you have a landing page and the right tools to drive and convert traffic,

it's time to think about your marketing strategy as a whole, and this begins

with some creative thinking. The modern entrepreneurs of today are able to

push their thinking beyond traditional methods (e.g. the usual Facebook post

or a simple Google display ad) and find ways of truly maximizing both budget

and effort. And the primary way to do this? Testing and experimentation 🔬

In this video, Rayan introduces the 'Growth Hacking Mindset', what it is, how

it compares to traditional digital marketing, and how to use testing and

optimization to drive more sales/acquisitions this month than you did last

month, and even more next month than you'll do this month - all by applying

the growth hacking mindset to your business 📈

🎓 Training Activity 1: Advocacy Strategy

\## Welcome!

Welcome to the first 🎓 Training Activity of the Advocacy Module, taught by

Thomas Strodtbeck.

This activity reviews the components of an advocacy strategy, how advocacy is

part of an accelerator's overall communication strategy, and how to align

advocacy efforts to the overall goals of the accelerator.

As you watch the video, consider the following questions:

🌻 Does my accelerator have a clearly defined advocacy strategy?

🌻 What are the overall goals of the accelerator? How could advocacy help your

reach those goals?

🏊🏽 Let's dive in!

In this Action, you will examine organizations and initiatives in your

ecosystem whose goals and objectives may align with your accelerator.

1\\. First, list your key programmatic outcomes as defined by your KPIs or

OKRs, and the indicators that support these outcomes.

2\\. Thinking about your community, list both the initiatives (i.e. a startup

program for women founders, or a program to encourage STEM education) and the

organizations (i.e. other accelerators, incubators, universities, and

government agencies) whose own goals and outcomes align with your programs.

This list will be the starting point for future advocacy efforts, so make it

as comprehensive as you can. This is a brainstorming exercise 🧠 Involve your

team in the process!

\## Welcome!

NINA: What do you mean you kissed the ground I walked on? I don’t deserve to

live. I’m so tired. If only I could rest – I need rest! I’m the seagull – but

I’m not really. I’m an actress. Yes. (She hears Arkadina and Trigorin

laughing.) So he’s here, too…well, it doesn’t matter. He never believed in

theatre, he always laughed at me for my dreams of being famous, and bit by bit

I stopped believing, too, and lost heart…there were all the other things to

worry about – love, jealousy…and always the worry about the baby. I became

trivial and commonplace. My work lost all meaning. On stage I didn’t know what

to do with my hands or how to stand, I couldn’t control my voice…You can’t

know what it’s like when you’re up there feeling you’re acting so badly. The

seagull. No, that’s not me…you remember how you once shot that seagull? A man

happened to come along and see her, and having nothing much to do, destroyed

her. Idea for a short story… No, that’s not it … what was I saying? Oh yes,

about acting… I’m not like that anymore. I’ve become a real actress. I love

acting, when I’m on stage I feel drunk on the sheer joy of it, and I feel

beautiful. While I’ve been back here I’ve spent a lot of time walking and

thinking – and every day I’ve felt my spirit getting stronger. What I’ve

realized, Kostya, is that, with us, whether we’re writers or actors, what

really counts is not dreaming about fame and glory…but stamina: knowing how to

keep going despite everything, and having faith in yourself – I’ve got faith

in myself now and that’s helped the pain, and when I think to myself, "You’re

on the stage!’ then I’m not afraid of anything life can to do to me.

📖 Reading: The Seagull (Monologue)

\## Image

\* !\[\](/assets/attUARr9GX0dQQbBl-The\_Seagull\_by\_Anton\_Chekhov)

\## Welcome!

NINA: What do you mean you kissed the ground I walked on? I don’t deserve to

live. I’m so tired. If only I could rest – I need rest! I’m the seagull – but

I’m not really. I’m an actress. Yes. (She hears Arkadina and Trigorin

laughing.) So he’s here, too…well, it doesn’t matter. He never believed in

theatre, he always laughed at me for my dreams of being famous, and bit by bit

I stopped believing, too, and lost heart…there were all the other things to

worry about – love, jealousy…and always the worry about the baby. I became

trivial and commonplace. My work lost all meaning. On stage I didn’t know what

to do with my hands or how to stand, I couldn’t control my voice…You can’t

know what it’s like when you’re up there feeling you’re acting so badly. The

seagull. No, that’s not me…you remember how you once shot that seagull? A man

happened to come along and see her, and having nothing much to do, destroyed

her. Idea for a short story… No, that’s not it … what was I saying? Oh yes,

about acting… I’m not like that anymore. I’ve become a real actress. I love

acting, when I’m on stage I feel drunk on the sheer joy of it, and I feel

beautiful. While I’ve been back here I’ve spent a lot of time walking and

thinking – and every day I’ve felt my spirit getting stronger. What I’ve

realized, Kostya, is that, with us, whether we’re writers or actors, what

really counts is not dreaming about fame and glory…but stamina: knowing how to

keep going despite everything, and having faith in yourself – I’ve got faith

in myself now and that’s helped the pain, and when I think to myself, "You’re

on the stage!’ then I’m not afraid of anything life can to do to me.

workshops with insights and opinions from outside. Use this exercise when

brainstorming ideas, developing a new product or service or creating a

strategy or plan that will include others. Participants phone a co-worker and

ask them questions relevant to the task. This quickly generates meaningful

input from a range of “outside” perspectives. Often, participants will be

## 📝 Bloom: Transition to Corporate Consulting
**Date**: 2023-05-05 | **Source**: chatgpt

> Here's a writing sample from me, can you update the text so it sounds more like me? "A few weeks ago, in Paris, I nearly got caught up with The Extinction Rebellion protestors getting teargassed right outside my doorstep. The country my family is from, Iraq, has been having protests have been going for months now with over 500 people killed. Lebanon’s Martyrs square, while full of protesters, has thankfully seen fewer killed. The Extinction Rebellion grows louder. It’s been about 10 years since the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring. In 2003, I remember being 18 years old and speaking in front of 3,000 people against the Iraqi invasion. Growing up in a college town, protests and demonstrations were commonplace, yet I’m wary of jumping into the crowd these days, especially when the crowd is angry.

Each of these movements has so much history and potential positive action, yet somehow I find myself unable to understand my responsibility towards them. Make your voice heard is the idea. As Desmond Tutu once said, “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”

“We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. The opposite of love is not hate, itâ€™s indifference.”
â€” Elie Wiesel

There’s a word I’ve been struggling to identify. It describes a situation where the more effort you put into something, the more tangled up you become in it. That somehow, when you’re caught in barbed wire, it’s best to stop moving, rather than struggle further and deepen the burrs. Perhaps this is the excuse I give myself to not act, not support, not back, not chant, not take to the streets. This fog has only grown thicker as the protests movements have moved closer and closer to home.

In response, I’ve recently become obsessed with learning about Gandhi. I’ve known he was an inspiration to Martin Luther King Junior and Mandela, who both led movements shifted the path of history towards one of greater justice. Yet, I never depend on my relationship with his thinking first hand. It surprised me to see how he was initially so keen on serving the British empire, how duty-bound he felt to support them in their time of need. How strict he was with himself to do what he believed was true.

The movie Gandhi which came out in 1982, paints him in a picture where he seemed to act for goodness or to support India’s liberation movement. What inspires me is that he saw his entire endeavor as seeking the truth. It’s still resolving for me, yet I’m beginning to understand the threads he makes between truth-seeking, seeing the other as the self, and nonviolent noncooperation.

Gandhi’s first experiments in communal living started after reading Unto This Last by Ruskin. which is essentially an economic and political argument the crux of which is equal pay for all work and free schooling for all people. It led him to make some conclusions about self-sufficiency and to start building what later became known as his first ashram in South Africa. I’m finding that proto villages, eco makerspaces, earth ships, hacker farms, rural co-living spaces, spiritual permaculture hubs and other similar type spaces have been inspiring me more in these last years. Although considering them as a social alternative seems to lead to a strange future where educated, upper-middle-class and tech-savvy people flee cities to take the place of the rural people who just left the farms for a better 20th-century life. The continuation of that trend seems to pave the way to a dystopian survivalist version of the future with micro governments (mobs?) rule principalities.

Gandhi was nationalistic, and he believed in an India ruled by its population. The injustice of the British empire was apparent to him. What are the fundamental injustices behind so many of our modern-day protest movements? Growing financial inequality, corruption — which to me can be seen as related to inequality in that it’s a sort of jealousy described as a call towards fairness and potential ecological collapse. To my mind, these are caught in a quagmire. It’s a bit like an escalating feud. Power leads to economic and political gain at the expense of people and environment. Then in the process of removing the offensive force, people desire the same power and economic gains at the expense – yet again – of the natural world and quite possibly abusing another class of people."

About the ACAT diagnostic
To be honest, the diagnostic sessions helped us rearrange our thoughts on developing our organization’s policies and structure. It gave us a better insight on how to reflect a better image of our work. This came handy once we started our large initiative to “reinvent the organization”, an initiative to update our policies, mission statement, and processes, and to make sure they are aligned with our activities.
The result was amazing, thanks for the team at Pitchworthy, especially Carol, who dedicated her time to help us analyze our strengths and weaknesses, and enhance our work accordingly. You can find attached our new organization profile, as a sample document resulting from this initiative.

Wonderhub: The energy and engagement of the other teams to support were incredible; I will surely be missing all this interaction once the sprint is over! 
Hadiyati: Such a great and amazing Bloom Team and Program! Being part of the 2 weeks sprint was a great opportunity for us to learn, share and brainstorm ideas with a great community with bright ideas, which proves once again that we, Lebanese people, will always strive and shine despite all circumstances.

From Bilal, Mireille, Nadine and AJ's board meeting: Everytime I mentor someone I learn. Every step is an addition to our knowledge and experience.
Mireille Wehbe:
We know a lot and we don't know everything, that's normal.
Not interacting with other mentors 4/5 times, not sure.
Official meetings, I've bombarded AJ with lots of email snad whatsapp messages. I'm the kind of person when I find something and have something in mind I immediately write it. I found this, just check it - I write it. These kinds of emails, 100MGB email, powerpoints and texts. Takes 2/3/4 days to go through things.

Feedback from WordWave-Lama Eid - ACSI2 Sprint Team :rocket::sunflower::blue_heart::
Hello,
Thank you bloom team for all the effort and time. I can't but say you are beautiful people with beautiful energy!
The WordWave team is lucky to be part of this program.For us, we are still at the very beginning and the sprint phase guided us and pushed us to progress faster and in a more goal oriented way.The progress we did for our startup is very valuable and we will always remember the bloom team as the one who supported us and believed in our mission and vision in our early stages..
Sharing our ideas with people with the same mindset , with future entrepreneurs is very encouraging and uplifting given the situation we are going through in lebanon.We learn and inspire each other to follow our passion and initiate what we think will have an impact on everyone around us.
And ofcourse a big thanks to the mentors for their prompt advice and guidance
We are grateful for this opportunity and we will be more than happy if chosen for the accelerator program, and if not, we hope to cross paths in future programs :)
Best,
Lama

## 📝 Update Request: Summarize!
**Date**: 2023-05-05 | **Source**: chatgpt

> Sample text: 
At Bloom, an affiliate of AltCity Impact, we have spent years perfecting our approach to supporting skills development, entrepreneurship education, and MSME development with a focus on building inclusive and impact-driven economies. Through our programs and the Bloom platform, we have worked with thousands of individuals and over 850 teams, mobilizing over $7m in next-stage funding and helping 50 startups create 224 jobs in the Lebanon Growth Accelerator program alone.

As we embark on a new journey, transitioning to working with corporate clients, we are excited to bring our wealth of experience to corporations, empowering their teams to excel in a similar fashion. We are actively seeking early adopters who recognize the value of improving their team's personal well-being alongside their work outputs, and who are ready to pioneer this innovative approach with us.

We understand the key differences between startups and corporate environments, and we are committed to adapting our approach accordingly, while still maintaining the core values of our programs. By carefully tailoring our methodologies, assessments, and activities to the unique needs of established businesses, we aim to help them thrive in today's fast-paced and competitive landscape.

Leveraging our years of experience and insights from working with hundreds of teams, we are poised to create a transformative impact on corporations, driving growth and success for their business. By combining our expertise with a deep understanding of the distinctions between startups and corporate settings, we will deliver an exceptional experience that fosters personal and professional growth, ultimately benefiting businesses, employees, and communities at large. Through our community-focused approach, we will work closely with these pioneering corporate clients to support the ecosystem and build toward collective scalable impact.

writing sample:
"A few weeks ago, in Paris, I nearly got caught up with The Extinction Rebellion protestors getting teargassed right outside my doorstep. The country my family is from, Iraq, has been having protests have been going for months now with over 500 people killed. Lebanon’s Martyrs square, while full of protesters, has thankfully seen fewer killed. The Extinction Rebellion grows louder. It’s been about 10 years since the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring. In 2003, I remember being 18 years old and speaking in front of 3,000 people against the Iraqi invasion. Growing up in a college town, protests and demonstrations were commonplace, yet I’m wary of jumping into the crowd these days, especially when the crowd is angry.

Each of these movements has so much history and potential positive action, yet somehow I find myself unable to understand my responsibility towards them. Make your voice heard is the idea. As Desmond Tutu once said, “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”

“We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. The opposite of love is not hate, itâ€™s indifference.”
â€” Elie Wiesel

There’s a word I’ve been struggling to identify. It describes a situation where the more effort you put into something, the more tangled up you become in it. That somehow, when you’re caught in barbed wire, it’s best to stop moving, rather than struggle further and deepen the burrs. Perhaps this is the excuse I give myself to not act, not support, not back, not chant, not take to the streets. This fog has only grown thicker as the protests movements have moved closer and closer to home.

In response, I’ve recently become obsessed with learning about Gandhi. I’ve known he was an inspiration to Martin Luther King Junior and Mandela, who both led movements shifted the path of history towards one of greater justice. Yet, I never depend on my relationship with his thinking first hand. It surprised me to see how he was initially so keen on serving the British empire, how duty-bound he felt to support them in their time of need. How strict he was with himself to do what he believed was true.

The movie Gandhi which came out in 1982, paints him in a picture where he seemed to act for goodness or to support India’s liberation movement. What inspires me is that he saw his entire endeavor as seeking the truth. It’s still resolving for me, yet I’m beginning to understand the threads he makes between truth-seeking, seeing the other as the self, and nonviolent noncooperation.

Gandhi’s first experiments in communal living started after reading Unto This Last by Ruskin. which is essentially an economic and political argument the crux of which is equal pay for all work and free schooling for all people. It led him to make some conclusions about self-sufficiency and to start building what later became known as his first ashram in South Africa. I’m finding that proto villages, eco makerspaces, earth ships, hacker farms, rural co-living spaces, spiritual permaculture hubs and other similar type spaces have been inspiring me more in these last years. Although considering them as a social alternative seems to lead to a strange future where educated, upper-middle-class and tech-savvy people flee cities to take the place of the rural people who just left the farms for a better 20th-century life. The continuation of that trend seems to pave the way to a dystopian survivalist version of the future with micro governments (mobs?) rule principalities.

Gandhi was nationalistic, and he believed in an India ruled by its population. The injustice of the British empire was apparent to him. What are the fundamental injustices behind so many of our modern-day protest movements? Growing financial inequality, corruption — which to me can be seen as related to inequality in that it’s a sort of jealousy described as a call towards fairness and potential ecological collapse. To my mind, these are caught in a quagmire. It’s a bit like an escalating feud. Power leads to economic and political gain at the expense of people and environment. Then in the process of removing the offensive force, people desire the same power and economic gains at the expense – yet again – of the natural world and quite possibly abusing another class of people."

Task 1 Response:
Studies have shown that there is a positive relationship between well-being and impact in social impact projects. Here are three main arguments supporting this relationship:
Increased sense of purpose: Engaging in social impact projects can provide individuals with a sense of purpose and meaning, which has been linked to increased well-being. When individuals feel that their efforts are contributing to a greater good, they may experience a greater sense of fulfillment and satisfaction with their work.
Enhanced social support: Social impact projects often involve working in groups and collaborating with others towards a common goal. This can lead to increased social support and a sense of community, which has been linked to improved well-being. Having a support network can help individuals navigate challenges and maintain a positive outlook.
Improved self-esteem: Making a positive impact in social impact projects can increase an individual's self-esteem and confidence. Knowing that their efforts are making a difference can lead to feelings of accomplishment and pride, which can contribute to overall well-being. Additionally, receiving recognition and praise for their work can further enhance self-esteem.

Executing "Task 2: Analyze the findings of the studies to identify three main arguments that demonstrate the relationship between well-being and impact in social impact projects"
After analyzing various studies, three main arguments that demonstrate the relationship between well-being and impact in social impact projects are:
Positive impact projects can enhance the well-being of individuals and communities, leading to a more sustainable and positive outcome. For example, projects that promote access to education, healthcare or clean water help to improve the quality of life of people, which in turn fosters positive social impact.
Engaging in social impact projects can also lead to increased personal satisfaction and fulfillment, contributing to one's overall well-being. Engaging in meaningful work and making a positive impact can lead to feelings of purpose and accomplishment, which can improve one's overall well-being.
Social impact projects that prioritize employee well-being and job satisfaction can lead to better outcomes for both the organization and the community it serves. This can include initiatives such as flexible work hours, wellness programs or team building activities, which can improve employee well-being and in turn lead to greater productivity and success in the project.

Possible response:
Short Document: The Relationship between Well-Being and Impact in Social Impact Projects
Social impact projects aim to make a positive difference in the world by addressing various social, environmental, or economic challenges. While impact is often measured by tangible outcomes such as reduced poverty, increased literacy, or improved health, the well-being of individuals and communities involved in the projects is also a crucial factor that impacts the success and sustainability of the projects. In this short document, we will explore three main arguments that illustrate the relationship between well-being and impact in social impact projects.
Argument 1: Well-being as a necessary condition for impact
In order to achieve sustainable and meaningful impact, social impact projects need to prioritize the well-being of the stakeholders involved, including the beneficiaries, the staff, the volunteers, the donors, and the partners. Well-being can refer to a broad range of factors that contribute to people's physical, emotional, social, and spiritual health and happiness. For example, well-being can be enhanced by providing access to basic needs such as food, water, shelter, healthcare, and education, as well as by promoting dignity, autonomy, creativity, and social connections. When people's well-being is neglected, compromised, or violated, they may become less motivated, less productive, less innovative, and less resilient, which can undermine the impact and the sustainability of the projects.
Argument 2: Impact as a source of well-being
While well-being is a precondition for impact, impact can also

Executing "Task 3: Use the identified arguments to create a short document that describes the relationship between well-being and impact in social impact projects"
The relationship between well-being and impact in social impact projects is a topic of increasing importance. Here are three key arguments:
Well-being is essential for sustainability: Social impact projects are typically aimed at creating positive change in society, but this change can only be achieved if the people involved in the project are thriving. Projects that prioritize the well-being of individuals and communities are more likely to succeed in the long-term.
Impact can have unintended consequences: While the goal of a social impact project may be to create positive change, it's important to consider the potential unintended consequences of that change. Projects that don't take well-being into account can inadvertently harm the very people they aim to help.
Measuring impact requires a holistic approach: Measuring the impact of a social impact project requires a holistic approach that takes into account not just economic outcomes, but also social and environmental outcomes. By prioritizing well-being as a key indicator of success, social impact projects can ensure that their impact is truly sustainable and beneficial to all involved.
Overall, prioritizing well-being in social impact projects is essential for creating sustainable, positive change in society.

> I like that, maybe we can riff on names like "learning to impact" and "reality checked" or check your reality at the door or I like talking to people about their why and their values and we can weave a thread. I need a catch question, sort of like Krista has "what's the spiritual background of your childhood" I'd like one question - perhaps about values - that can lead the conversation and maybe lead to our question. What's something you changed your mind about in terms of impact? Something like that that's counter intuitive

## 📝 Dusk Mist Listing Guide
**Date**: 2023-03-28 | **Source**: chatgpt

> Can you help me write a wonderful etsy listing for a new product, a prayer rug spray. We want to share it in a secular way without sounding too woo. It's a perfume spray / room spray / rug spray - different words for it. It's called The Dusk Mist, a 100% natural essential oils-based mist with Amber, essential oils of orange peel, and night queen flower and Cambodian out.

---

> Make a similar post to the Etsy listing above for the Dusk for the Dawn listing, reference the dusk listing and here's more information The Dawn Mist, a 100% natural and organic essential oils-based mist with essential oils of rose, yuzu, and bergamot with a rose water base. Can you add some islam inspired subtle references about Nur, light, the divine name, plants, working with Haffsa, a  crafts person in Morocco for the organic rose water base and rose oil that it's non alcoholic?

## 📝 Animate Islamic Prayer Times.
**Date**: 2023-03-25 | **Source**: chatgpt

> can you generate wolfram language code for the following natural language description? 
Goal: I want to see a circle going around inside a larger circle split into 5 segments which represent the different times of day for prayer.
Detailed description of how I would do it, first I would get the latitude and longitude, let's use Paris France for the location and March 25th, 2023 for the date. Next I would understand the islamic principals for the times of prayer, Fajir starts at dawn, Thur at high noon, etc. 
Finally I would create the prayer times, and then split up the 24 hours with that ratio. 
Finally I'd move the indicator circle (the smaller circle within the larger circle) at 1 radian per minute per day, then I would draw the lines to dissect the larger circle into five depending on how many radians(or minuets) it is between each prayer. 
Tell me first a natural language summary, then tell me in Wolfram code how to do that, you may use python as a backup

> Can you do this without the HTML, I have a p5 editor open so I can just run the script. In the script you gave me it's missing the pie chart and it doesn't say the current time, it's also missing fajir prayer and things seem out of order. 
You are a computer answering questions. If you need any current information to answer the question, it searches the web by saying SEARCH("query"), reads the snippets in the result, and then repairs the code

---

> why is isha between sunrise and thuhur, it should be after Maghreb and before fajir. Also there are two pie slices, blue and purple, that don't have titles after Maghreb that seem useless. Also, Fajir is at 90 degrees, it should be at 180 degrees. and sunrise should be a different color. All prayer times should have a color associated with something that reminds people of the sun at that time, Fajir should be dawn colored, for instance, and Isha dusk

Description
Enjoy a pure sandalwood essential oil. For thousands of years it has been long used as a cosmetic and fragrance due to its calming and harmonizing effect on the mind. This makes sandalwood great to use for meditation. 

This sandalwood is gently powerful, woody, oily and delicious. A warm scent to treat yourself or your loved ones on a cold day. It makes me happy just smelling it and I hope it does the same for you.


All of our oils are made using natural ingredients using traditional extraction methods. We source them ourselves from Kannauj India a city known to have been producing essential oils for the last 7000 years! The images above are from the factory visit in October 2015. Wear some history :).

Listing review by Emanuel Buttgen
It finally arrived! It took a bit because of the holidays and covid, bit it was totally worth the wait. I ordered multiple products, but sandalwood was the one that completely blew my mind, I'm totally in love with it! I was I bit disappointed with the frangipani, but I guess it was because my own expectations, because of a version I had before that I absolutely loved, and this one does not resemble, but also smells really great. I was offered a lovely sample with an intriguing smell, but I cannot identify it, and it does not resemble anything that's here in the shop. There seems to be written fomgere absolute, but I'm not sure since it's handwritten. Could you please help me with that? Overall I'm really happy with the buy! Thank you

Listing review by Teresa
An incredibly high quality oil. This sandalwood fragrance has a warm character with a light buttery note, so much like nature’s nectar. I use Nur Creative Studio's oils for my breathwork sessions. The smells are almost mystical. I also love the sustainable packaging and the conscious approach of the owners with great stories behind each oil. Purpose and joy can always be felt, pure light. Thank you guys!

I’m really disappointed in the packaging. The package had oil all over it. There was practically nothing to protect the oil vials. But they arrived. So 👍. Thank you for the extra oil you sent.

Description
Enjoy a pure sandalwood essential oil. For thousands of years it has been long used as a cosmetic and fragrance due to its calming and harmonizing effect on the mind. This makes sandalwood great to use for meditation. 

This sandalwood is gently powerful, woody, oily and delicious. A warm scent to treat yourself or your loved ones on a cold day. It makes me happy just smelling it and I hope it does the same for you.


All of our oils are made using natural ingredients using traditional extraction methods. We source them ourselves from Kannauj India a city known to have been producing essential oils for the last 7000 years! The images above are from the factory visit in October 2015. Wear some history :). 

Here's the article on Kannauj that inspired us to visit:

Listing review by Emanuel Buttgen
It finally arrived! It took a bit because of the holidays and covid, bit it was totally worth the wait. I ordered multiple products, but sandalwood was the one that completely blew my mind, I'm totally in love with it! I was I bit disappointed with the frangipani, but I guess it was because my own expectations, because of a version I had before that I absolutely loved, and this one does not resemble, but also smells really great. I was offered a lovely sample with an intriguing smell, but I cannot identify it, and it does not resemble anything that's here in the shop. There seems to be written fomgere absolute, but I'm not sure since it's handwritten. Could you please help me with that? Overall I'm really happy with the buy! Thank you
