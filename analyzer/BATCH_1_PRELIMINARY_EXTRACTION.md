## 🎯 Values Card #1: "The Curious Knowledge-Weaver"

### What You Pay Attention To (Attention Policies):

- **QUESTIONS that spark genuine fascination** and pull you away from "should do" tasks
- **FRAMEWORKS that reveal hidden patterns** across domains (education, social enterprise, technology)
- **CONNECTIONS between disparate ideas** that others might miss
- **COMMUNITIES where curious minds gather** (hackerspaces, maker culture, GEMSI)
- **MOMENTS when research feels alive** rather than like work
- **EXPLORATIONS that let time disappear** ("I get lost on questions when they capture me")

### Where This Shows Up (Manifestations):

**In conversations:**
- Systematically explored 5+ educational frameworks in one sitting (PERMAH → Universal Skills → Habits of Mind → Skills Builder → PERMA at Work)
- Requested comparative analysis via tables to see connections
- Asked "how can we assess?" (practical application of theoretical frameworks)

**In your projects:**
- Co-founded GEMSI.org to bring hackerspaces to Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, MENA
- Created Flybrary (online book lending library) - democratizing access to knowledge
- Work at Instructables ("lots of weird things") - maker culture, DIY knowledge sharing
- Bloom curriculum design - using assessments + interventions for growth

**In your work at Bloom:**
- Responsible for curriculum and training (designing how people learn)
- Comparing frameworks to design better programs
- "I'm nerdy, great at research"

### Your Words (Ground Truth):

> *"I'm nerdy, great at research, I get lost on questions when they capture me like how should I use ChatGPT for work."*

> *"I would like to become more of an expert in something rather than a generalist. I feel like I'm all over the place."*

> *"I want to learn more about economics and human values and international policy. I wonder if we can have a beautiful future of people living their values at work..."*

> *"I am thrilled when I learn something new."* (Character Strength: Love of Learning = 5/5)

> *"I read all of the time."* (Character Strength assessment)

### What You Might Not See:

This isn't just "being curious" - it's a **specific way of finding meaning** through *connecting* knowledge, not just consuming it. You don't just read; you **compare, map, and weave frameworks together**.

You described it as a "weakness" ("I get lost... and I ignore lots of important things"), but this is actually a **CAP** (Constitutive Action) - something you do for its own sake because it makes you come alive.

The "important things" you ignore? Those are often **IAPs** (Instrumental Actions) - obligations that don't spark your curiosity.

### The Tension This Reveals:

**Type**: CAP vs IAP
**Title**: "Curiosity-Driven Exploration vs Task Completion"

**From** (Current State):
- **IAPs** you feel you "should" do: Finish presentations, call clients, complete proposals, "get things to done"
- **Emotions**: Fear ("I'm scared to call people"), procrastination, feeling "all over the place"
- **Your words**: "That's the problem I'm facing, how to stop innovating and get things to done"

**To** (Potential Transformation):
- What if the "things to get done" could be **reframed as research questions**?
- Example: Instead of "We need more clients" → "What patterns make certain organizations choose accelerators like Bloom?"
- Instead of "Finish this presentation" → "What frameworks would make this presentation reveal something new?"

### Confidence Score:

**0.92** - Extremely high confidence based on:
- Self-identified pattern across multiple conversations
- Consistent across assessments (Curiosity 4.8/5, Love of Learning 5/5, Creativity 5/5)
- Manifests in all your projects (GEMSI, Flybrary, Bloom, Instructables)
- Colleagues confirm: Avery says "Bilal works best in conversation with experts", Dara says "you think better in dialogue"

  ],
  "confidence": 0.89
}
```

### The Tension Breakdown:

**CAP** (What makes you come alive):
- Getting absorbed in research questions
- Exploring frameworks and connecting ideas
- "Innovating" - trying new approaches
- Learning and intellectual exploration

**IAP** (What you feel obligated to do):
- Completing structured work products (presentations, proposals)
- Calling potential clients (sales)
- "Getting things to done that we can sell"
- Following through on commitments

**Emotional Signals**:
- **Fear**: "I'm scared to call people"
- **Frustration**: "I feel like I'm all over the place"
- **Self-criticism**: Identifying curiosity as "a weakness"
- **Procrastination**: Avoiding "important things" that don't capture interest

### Transformation Potential:

**Current frame**: "I need to stop being so curious and just finish things"
**Reframe**: "How can I harness my curiosity to *inform* completion, or partner with people who turn ideas into reality?"

**Colleagues already see this**:
- Dara: "Having a research buddy (Ghina) and experimentation buddy (me and PMs) to help put things into action"
- Habib: "Getting busy with new ideas and work with people directly"
- Carol: "Bilal is a great listener and inspiring person - managing teams would bring value"

### Opportunity Identified:

You don't need to **stop** being curious. You need **partners who thrive on execution**. Your assessment shows:
- **Creativity**: 5/5 (maxed out)
- **Teamwork**: 2.67/8 (low)
- **Leadership**: 2.8/8 (low)

What if instead of "becoming less curious," you **build a team** where:
- **You**: Research, frameworks, innovation, vision
- **Others**: Execution, systematization, completion

Dara literally says: "Ghina is methodical and systematic and can help organize your experiments"

## 🔍 Blindspots Identified

### Blindspot #1: Curiosity as Strength, Not Weakness

**What you see**: "I get lost on questions... which is a weakness"

**What you might not see**: This is your CORE VALUE and competitive advantage. Every successful project you've built (GEMSI, Flybrary, Bloom, Instructables work) came FROM your curiosity, not despite it.

**Evidence**: Your highest character strengths are ALL curiosity-related:
- Creativity: 5/5
- Love of Learning: 5/5
- Curiosity: 4.8/5
- Judgment: 5/5

**Impact**: You're trying to "fix" your greatest strength, which creates internal conflict and procrastination.

---

### Blindspot #2: Execution Through Partnership, Not Solo Effort

**What you see**: "I need to stop innovating and get things done"

**What you might not see**: You don't need to become a different person. You need **complementary partners**.

**Evidence**: Colleagues literally tell you this:
- Dara: "having a research buddy (Ghina) and an experimentation buddy (me and PMs)"
- Habib: "work with people directly"
- Avery: "Bilal works best in conversation with experts"

But your assessment shows:
- Teamwork: 2.67/8 (low!)
- Leadership: 2.8/8 (low!)

**Impact**: You're not building the team structures that would let you thrive.

---

### Blindspot #3: Generalist IS Your Expertise

**What you see**: "I would like to become more of an expert in something rather than a generalist. I feel like I'm all over the place."

**What you might not see**: Your ability to **connect across domains** (education + technology + social impact + maker culture) IS your expertise. That's extremely rare and valuable.

**Evidence**:
- You bring hackerspaces (maker culture) to MENA (social impact)
- You apply robotics (tech) to entrepreneurship education (learning)
- You connect educational frameworks (PERMAH) to business models (Bloom)

**Impact**: You're seeking to narrow your focus when your value comes from breadth + synthesis.

---

## 💡 Opportunities Identified

### Opportunity #1: Reframe "Completion" as Research Questions

**Current**: "We need more clients" (feels like obligation)

**Reframe**: "What patterns make organizations choose accelerators like Bloom?" (feels like curiosity)

**How**: Every "to-do" becomes a research question:
- "Finish presentation" → "What framework would make this presentation reveal new insights?"
- "Call potential clients" → "What do these organizations struggle with? (research interviews)"
- "Document tech knowledge" (Claude's feedback) → "What patterns in tool usage would help the team?"

**Evidence this would work**:
- You systematically explored 5 frameworks when the question captured you
- You dove deep into "how to use ChatGPT for work" when it was interesting
- Dara says "always the first to share and distill external research"

---

### Opportunity #2: Build Your "Execution Team"

**Current**: Trying to do everything yourself

**Proposed**: Assemble a small team with complementary strengths:

**Your role**: Research, Innovation, Vision, Framework Design
- Strengths: Creativity 5/5, Curiosity 4.8/5, Love of Learning 5/5

**Partner #1** (Systematic Executor): Someone like Ghina or Dara
- Strengths: Planning, Organization, Systematization
- Role: Turn your research into structured programs

**Partner #2** (People Connector): Someone like Carol or Habib
- Strengths: Networking, Sales, Client relationships
- Role: Handle the "calling people" you fear

**Evidence this is needed**:
- All 6 colleagues mentioned you need help with execution/planning
- Your lowest scores: Aiming High 2.43/8, Teamwork 2.67/8, Leadership 2.8/8
- You explicitly say: "people who have a different mindset, the fishing sort of mindset that turns ideas into done"

---

### Opportunity #3: "Learning Labs" Instead of "Deliverables"

**Current**: Bloom needs "things to sell"

**Proposed**: Package your research process as a product

**Examples**:
- "Framework Comparison Labs" - teach organizations how to compare educational frameworks
- "AI Integration Workshops" - share your ChatGPT explorations with corporate clients
- "Knowledge-Weaving Sessions" - help teams connect disparate ideas

**Why this works**:
- Turns your CAP (research) into IAP (revenue)
- No longer fighting your nature
- Colleagues confirm: Avery says "Bilal's emerging expertise with GPT and AI tools could help Bloom jump ahead"

**Evidence you'd be good at this**:
- Speaking 4/4 (high!)
- "I speak persuasively and can articulate a compelling vision"
- Carol: "Bilal is great listener and inspiring person"
- Habib: "Bilal = Compass (leading toward core value)"
