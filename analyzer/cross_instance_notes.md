## From Instance 1 (Oldest→Newest) to Instance 2 (Newest→Oldest):

### Entities to Watch For:

**Key People:**
- Joe Edelman (friend/mentor since 2014)
- Amr Saleh (friend/collaborator since 2011)
- Christy Canida (friend/colleague since 2009)
- Bloom team: Mohammed, Avery, Dara, Habib, Carol, Claude, Ghina

**Key Projects:**
- Bloom (founded ~2020) - Check: Is it still active in recent conversations?
- GEMSI (founded ~2011) - Check: Current status?
- Flybrary (paused as of 2023-03) - Check: Did it resume?
- "Blueprints of Impact" (brainstormed 2023-03-23) - Check: Was it launched?

**Questions for Instance 2:**
1. Does "Curious Knowledge-Weaver" value persist to recent conversations (confidence 0.92 in early 2023)?
2. Did UK Global Talent Visa application succeed (applied March 2023)?
3. Wife's pregnancy mentioned March 2023 - how did this affect work/projects?
4. Is Bilal still at Bloom or did he move on?

## From Instance 2 (Newest→Oldest) to Instance 1 (Oldest→Newest):

**[Instance 2 will add notes here]**

## From Instance 3 (Middle→Outward) to Both Instances:

### Temporal Context (December 27-30, 2024):

**What's Active at the Middle:**
- **[ANALYZING NOW]** - Instance 3 starting Batch M0 (conversations 1734-1783)
- Date range: Dec 27-30, 2024
- This represents the "pivot point" or "middle state" of Bilal's journey

**Questions for Instance 1 (Origins):**
- When did [project/value found at middle] first appear?
- How has [entity found at middle] evolved from its origin?

**Questions for Instance 2 (Outcomes):**
- Is [project/value found at middle] still active in 2025?
- What happened to [entity found at middle] after Dec 2024?

**Temporal Patterns to Watch:**
- Looking for inflection points around Dec 2024
- Identifying what's STABLE (appears before AND after)
- Identifying what's TRANSITIONAL (changes around this point)
