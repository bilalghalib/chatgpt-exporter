## From Instance 3 (Middle→Outward) to Both Instances:

### Temporal Context (December 27-30, 2024):

**What's Active at the Middle (Dec 27-30, 2024):**

**MAJOR PROJECT**: "Barakanomics" Book 📚
- Full title: "Barakanomics: The Power of a Truly Halal Economy"
- Comprehensive book proposal combining Islamic economics + regenerative business + permaculture
- Target audience: Muslim entrepreneurs, conscious consumers
- Key themes: Halal rizq, baraka in business, 8 forms of capital, decommodification, relationships over transactions
- Philosophy: "Not moving so fast you leave your soul behind"

**Active Organizations:**

2. **Nur Coop** (since 2015) - "blessing entire value chain from Dirt to Delivery"
3. **Project Defy** (advisor) - education nonprofit in India

**Core Value at Middle**: "i don't like working for other people's ideas just for money, i usually like being invested in projects i care about" (AUTONOMY + MEANING-DRIVEN WORK)

**Life Context**: Located in Lambersart, France; wrestling with choice between consulting (money) vs. growing small business (meaning)

**Questions for Instance 1 (Origins):**
- When did "Barakanomics" concept first appear? (found active Dec 2024)
- When did Nur Coop actually start? (claims 2015 in book proposal)
- When did Bilal move to France?
- When did Islamic economics become a focus?
- When did permaculture/8 forms of capital framework appear?
- What's the origin of autonomy value (working on own projects vs. for money)?

**Questions for Instance 2 (Outcomes):**
- Was Barakanomics book completed/published after Dec 2024?
- Did Bilal choose consulting or small business path?
- Is Bloom still active in 2025? (very active as of Dec 2024)
- Is Nur Coop still running in 2025?
- Is he still in France in 2025?
- Did the values creation tool/process continue?

**Temporal Patterns to Watch:**
- Looking for inflection points around Dec 2024
- Identifying what's STABLE (appears before AND after)
- Identifying what's TRANSITIONAL (changes around this point)
