## ⚡ PATTERNS: CAPs vs IAPs

### **CAPs** (Constitutive Actions - done for their own sake):
1. **Getting lost in research** ("I get lost on questions when they capture me")
2. **Learning through Socratic dialogue** (spent 1+ hour learning tensors, 95 messages!)
3. **Creating hilarious, innovative projects** (smell guitar, invisible graffiti, wearable compass)
4. **Building meaning-infused products** (Petrichor Oil, Dusk Mist with spiritual philosophy)
5. **Community building** (All Hands Active, GEMSI, hackerspaces)
6. **Critical thinking / questioning systems** (Impact Nexus, challenging impact sector)
7. **Mentoring / coaching** (helping Josephine with career transition)

### **IAPs** (Instrumental Actions - obligations):
1. **Completing deliverables / systematic execution** (self-reported struggle)
2. **Sales / client outreach** ("I'm scared to call people - that fear leads to procrastination")
3. **Program management** (eon 2023 design, timelines, budgets)
4. **Assessment data analysis** (wellbeing research, post-traumatic growth)
5. **SEO optimization** (NurCoop Etsy listings)
6. **Professional presentations** (UK visa applications, company profiles)

### **Primary Tension**:
**"That's the problem I'm facing, how to stop innovating and get things done."**

**Score Evidence**:
- Aiming High: 2.43/8 (LOWEST score)
- Persistence: 3.2/5.0
- Teamwork: 3.2/5.0 (prefers autonomy)

**Proposed Solutions** (from assessments):
1. Reframe completion as research questions

3. Package research/exploration as products (not just process)
