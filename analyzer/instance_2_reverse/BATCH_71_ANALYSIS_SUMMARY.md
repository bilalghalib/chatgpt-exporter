## 😰 **EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE & AVOIDANCE PATTERNS**

### Major Crisis: Website/Online Presence (Nov 17, 2024)
**Emotions**:
- Shame: "I feel really ashamed to use [social media] during a time of genocide and war"
- Self-doubt: "Maybe I don't want to share because I don't admire myself or something"
- Self-criticism: "I'm such a critic... I think everyone is stupid, and that's not healthy"
- Fear of inadequacy: "I don't feel like my website engenders trust"

**Avoidance Patterns**:
1. **Website redesign** - knows it's needed, can't bring himself to do it
2. **Social media** - conflicted about sharing during war, feels only thing should share is genocide
3. **Self-promotion** - needs work/contracts but intense self-criticism blocks sharing

**Therapy-Relevant Themes**:
- Self-criticism and projection ("everyone is stupid")
- Shame and moral conflict (sharing during genocide)
- Self-worth issues (doesn't admire self)
- Perfectionism blocking action
- Approach-avoidance conflict (knows what to do, can't do it)

### Financial Anxiety
- "I don't make money, a little consulting"
- Urgency to get work/contracts
- Applying to 2 jobs simultaneously
- Analyzing Nur Coop growth
- This explains the intensity of the crossroads moment

- **Applications**: Wellbeing Registry, "ChatGPT for teachers" analysis

---

## 🎯 **PATTERNS & INSIGHTS**

### Decision-Making
- **Approach**: "Prayer and values" (direct quote from Bilal)
- **Evidence**: VX methodology (values-first), Beit-al-Atlas (unlikely friendships), Post-Bloom org (ubuntu/mutual aid)
- **Consistency**: All major projects align with stated values

### Project Persistence
- **What lasts**: Nur Coop (10 years), Islamic practices, values-driven work
- **What ended**: Bloom (4 years, misalignment with co-founder)
- **Pattern**: Projects tied to deeper values/relationships persist; purely instrumental ones don't

### Tensions
1. **Innovation vs Completion** - many projects in ideation/planning
2. **Authenticity vs Promotion** - needs visibility but blocks self-promotion
3. **Work during war** - moral conflict about normalcy during genocide
4. **Individual identity vs Organizational shadow** - "glad to not have to be in shadows of an org"

### Geographic Movement
- **Current**: Lille, France
- **Considering**: Madison, WI (job offer)
- **Unknown**: UK Global Talent Visa outcome (applied March 2023)
- **Pattern**: ??  (Instance 1 should find earlier moves)
