I am also attempting to identify new program styles that we can run faster and for different audiences. We run training programs that use assessments and libraries of interventions to help people grow personally and professionally. If you have ideas about how to use chat GPT in that instance, give me a prompt showing that.\n4. obstacles are that we need more clients, we are a nonprofit accelerator and our budgets are capped and we have a small amount of overhead for creativity, well-being activities at work, etc. We want corporate clients, or to sell the software we're making \n5. I see myself stabilizing the organization and being focused on research, creative work, values alignment, working on new financial models to support social enterprises, new program design to bring those financial models to life, etc.\n6. I want to learn more about economics and human values and international policy. I wonder if we can have a beautiful future of people living their values at work and also have the sort of scalable growth we have. Lots of question about meaning and money and life and death. \n7. I'm interested in practical things I can do that involve others, reading a book or doing an activity alone won't captivate me. I should do something where we can work together - perhaps online on a zoom call that will help me share my research and also help the team connect and overcome my problem of procrastination and continual research by allowing myself to work with people who have a different mindset, the fishing sort of mindset that turns ideas into done. That's the problem I'm facing, how to stop innovating and get things to done, especially get things to done that we can sell. I'm also scared to call people - that fear leads to procrastination.\n8. I prefer online courses and activities with great facilitation around areas I'm interested in. I also have a problem where I love reading yet I don't take good enough notes and even if I do I don't know how to turn notes into productive action for Bloom.\n\nDo you see my problems, what opportunities do you see? \nAfter you write your response to all the above can you give me a dump of all the knowledge you have about me, about Boom, about the assessments, about the context and opportunity. All of it as verbose as possible. Rewrite this entire conversation between a user and an assistant, so as to only be written from the perspective of the user.

Explore ways to use AI tools like ChatGPT to enhance Bloom's curriculum and training, making it more engaging and effective for participants.\n3.

Implement a system for taking and organizing notes, making it easier to turn your reading and research into actionable steps for Bloom.\n\nHere is a summary of the knowledge I have gathered about you, Bloom, the assessments, and the context and opportunities:\n\nBilal Ghalib is the co-founder and Head of Research at Bloom, a non-profit accelerator that aims to create positive change by facilitating personal and professional development for social entrepreneurs in the Middle East and Africa. He has 18 years of experience working with social enterprises and organizations in the USA and MENA. Bilal holds a Master's degree from the Universite de Paris in Interdisciplinary Approaches to Research and Education. He is a champion of wellbeing in the workplace and has received the Compassionate Leaders Fellowship USA/India with H.H. The Dalai Lama from 2019-2022.\n\nBilal is responsible for curriculum and training at Bloom, and he is currently a facilitator of a new program. His role involves identifying new program styles for different audiences and using assessments and libraries of interventions to help people grow personally and professionally. He would like to learn more about economics, human values, and international policy and is interested in exploring ways to use AI tools like ChatGPT to improve Bloom's offerings. He also wants to stabilize the organization and work on new financial models to support social enterprises, as well as new program designs to bring those financial models to life.\n\nBilal has completed two assessments to identify his strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Based on the assessment results, he has strong research and creative thinking skills, but struggles with time management, focus, and prioritization. He also has a fear of making phone calls, which leads to procrastination.\n\nTo help Bilal grow personally and professionally and improve the likelihood of Bloom's growth and success, I recommend focusing on the following areas:\n\n1. Developing expertise in a specialized area that aligns with his interests and future vision.\n2. Exploring ways to use AI tools like ChatGPT to enhance Bloom's curriculum and training.\n3. Improving time management and prioritization skills to focus on actionable projects.\n4. Overcoming the fear of making phone calls and engaging with potential clients or partners more effectively.\n5. Collaborating with the team to share research and insights and leverage",

      "content": "To provide you with three more activities tailored to Bilal's and Bloom's needs, I would need to know more about the strengths, weaknesses, and interests of the rest of the Bloom team, as well as their roles and responsibilities within the organization. This information will help me understand how their skills and knowledge can complement Bilal's and how they can collaborate effectively on different activities.\n\nBased on the provided information and the list of activities, I suggest the following additional activities:\n\n4. **Modified \"Sprint Week\"**: Adapt the \"Sprint Week\" activity from the list to focus on new program styles and financial models that support social enterprises. Bilal and the Bloom team can engage in a week-long sprint where they brainstorm, design, prototype, and test new program ideas and financial models. This activity can help Bilal learn how to move from idea to execution more quickly and efficiently, while also potentially generating new programs and revenue streams for Bloom.\n\nWhy: This activity addresses Bilal's desire to innovate new program styles and explore alternative financial models. By working in a focused, time-bound manner, Bilal can learn how to turn ideas into action and achieve tangible results, which is one of his primary challenges.\n\n5. **Adapted \"Innovator's Journey\"**: Modify the \"Innovator's Journey\" activity to focus on Bilal's interests in economics, human values, and international policy. Bilal can undertake a series of interviews and conversations with experts in these fields, exploring the relationship between these topics and the future of social enterprises. This activity can help Bilal develop a deeper understanding of these subjects and apply the insights gained to improve Bloom's programs and strategies.\n\nWhy: This activity aligns with Bilal's interests in economics, human values, and international policy, and addresses his desire to become an expert in a specific area. By engaging with experts, Bilal can expand his knowledge and apply it to improve Bloom's programs and strategies.\n\n6. **Team Book Club with Action Planning**: Organize a team book club focused on books related to Bilal's interests and Bloom's mission. The team can read, discuss, and collaborate to create action plans based on the insights gained from the books. This activity can help Bilal improve his note-taking and action-planning skills, as well as foster a shared understanding and learning experience among the team.\n\nWhy: This activity addresses Bilal's challenge of turning his reading and note-taking into productive action for Bloom. By involving the team and working together to create action plans, Bilal can ensure that the knowledge gained is put to good use for the benefit of the organization.\n\nUnderstanding the Bloom team's strengths, weaknesses, and interests will help tailor these activities even further to maximize their effectiveness and ensure that they address both Bilal's personal and professional growth and Bloom's organizational needs.",

I will give you more context in the form of answering more questions here, I will first list the questions then give you the responses below:\nQuestions:\n• What is your current role and responsibilities at Bloom? How do you spend your time and what are your key priorities?\n• What are Bloom's key goals and metrics for growth? What key initiatives or programs are you focused on to achieve them?\n• What are your strengths and weaknesses as a leader? What skills do you want to improve or develop further? How can I support you in improving them?\n• What is your ideal work-life balance and how well do you currently maintain it? What wellbeing practices do you use and what more could you implement?\n• What are your hopes and ambitions for yourself and Bloom in the next 3-5 years? What milestones do you aim to achieve?\n• Is there any part of your role or the company's operations I should have more context about to fully understand your needs and provide the best support? What other information would be helpful?\n• What motivates or energulates you in your work? What are the most meaningful components of company culture to you? How do you define success? What is your vision for the company's impact or influence?\n• What challenges are you currently facing as a leader or with the organization? How could mentoring and support help you to overcome them?\nDoes this help provide more context into your current role, responsibilities, priorities, goals and challenges at Bloom to enable me to gain a better sense of how I can support your development? Please let me know if you have any other questions. I'm happy to discuss further details or provide additional information to support you.\nI am responsible at Bloom for our curriculum and training. I'm a facilitator of a new program. I am also attempting to identify new program styles that we can run faster and for different audiences. We run training programs that use assessments and libraries of interventions to help people grow personally and professionally.\nMeasures for growth are number of mentor matches, team skill development, number of teams working on different sdgs, post program growth in revenue for teams, activities done by teams to grow. We also measure number of teams on the platform. Active users.\nStrengths as a leader is my creativity, and my ability to excite people around a cause. I'm a good public speaker. Visionary. I also care about people\nWeaknesses as a leader, time management, delegation, procrastination, inability to make difficult phone calls\nI want you to help me find the right skills to develop and help me learn how. I want to learn the skills that I think will be innately and deeply meaningful, I can't learn something when I am not completely engaged in it.\nHopes for Bloom and myself is that bloom is a profitable social enterprise that it is making money and that I am personally financially well off as well. I see myself stabilizing the organization and being focused on research, creative work, values alignment, working on new financial models to support social enterprises, new program design to bring those financial models to life, etc.\nthe most meaningful parts of our culture is how kind and helpful we are, we are all mission driven and care about seeing our teams thrive. I love hearing our teams talk about how we create a positive impact in their lives and that they are very grateful for our support and that they can continue doing their impactful work because of our supportive community and funds.\nI think I don't know exactly my role at work so I work on everything and I am not sure how I am improving as a professional. I do growth and work on proposal writing, I do innovation and research on methods and data, I'm a facilitator yet I'm not \"advancing my career\" I'm doing all the things needed to help Bloom thrive and grow. Somehow I don't even know if I can focus, because if I did one thing I would find that I stagnate, waste time. I like being in many things although sometimes I can also be paralyzed because I don't know what's the priority thing to do. I'm a bit chaotic at work and miss opportunities, meetings, people asking me to review things, it's all a bit much...\n",

I provided my learning goals, current situation, and the problems Bloom is facing. The AI asked several follow-up questions to gather more context, and I answered those questions.\n\nThe AI then provided a list of activities based on the context and assessment results, and I asked for an additional list of activities that take the best advantage of all the context provided.

      "content": "Extracting what you think Bilal finds meaningful in his work based on the above information, generate a structured meaning card behind why I find this experience meaningful.\n\nA meaning card consists of a short name, a set of things I look for in order to live by that value, and a set of ways life becomes when living by the value. Below is a short description of what makes a good meaning card:\n\nShort name:\n- Should be pithy and unlikely to be confused with nearby values.\n\nWhat I look for:\n- One sentence per section.\n- The sections should not be about preparation for the meaningful experience, but that actually attending to these things and choosing by them feels meaningful itself.\n- Imagine a friend has this value, and they are in a context where things that are meaningful in this way are happening around them\\u2014or they are in an environment where they could easily live by the value. But, they haven\\u2019t noticed this yet. If you slipped them this card - would they see exactly what to attend to, to make this experience meaningful?\n- The value card should be clear enough that you\\u2019d know what to ask a group of people to see if it was happening for them or not.\n\nPart of Being\n- The part of being words should be there because it\\u2019s directly part of the good life, not because of a clear goal or fear (such as \\u201Cacting normal\\u201D, \\u201Cbeing accepted\\u201D, \\u201Cmaking money\\u201D, etc).\n- Make sure it is not an internalized norm. An internalized norm is a norm about how you think others think you should behave that you have internalized.\n- Make sure it is not a goal or a way to meet others\\u2019 expectations.\n\nMake sure the card is not too specific, not too broad, not overly-poetic and free from negative language (like \\u201Cbe free from\\u201D or \\u201Cignore\\u201D etc.). Every attentional policy should be separated by a newline. Every section in \"What I look for\" should have one corresponding section in \"Parts of Being\".\n\n\nExamples: ###\n\nStory: \nI went swimming one morning and did laps. I was pushing my body and getting my heart rate up. I felt like I was rejuvenating my soul. My breathing was heavy, and by the time I finished my muscles were tired. Part of the meaningfulness was about knowing my body is getting stronger and leaner. That\\u2019s important to me. It was also very focused, I wasn\\u2019t dealing with small tasks that I often need to as a father, and neither was I intellectually drifting on twitter. It was similar to being engrossed in slow and critical reading of a book, where my focus stayed on one topic for a long time.\n\nMeaning card:\nShort name: Exercising to the limit\nWhat I look for: Focus on my body\\u2019s movement. Feelings of my body being worked to its limit; high heart-rate, tired muscles. Exercises that unlock a greater strength.\nPart of being: Strong, energetic, rejuvenated\n\n##\n\nStory: \nI was making a video about how to make values cards. It was really exciting to be productive in this cool niche way. I was doing something I felt only I could do. The work itself was tough- I had to pause and think. I needed to take my time and allow myself some \\u2018cool\\u2019 time in between the hot time I was working. Whenever I had a solution that felt elegant I felt really really good with myself. The other important thing is that the final product is one that I\\u2019m proud of and could share with the rest of the Social Design clique. I also lived by this value when I wrote my Substack. It was intellectual work that was contributing something very unique, that I felt I was in a unique position to give to the world.\n\nMeaning card: \nShort name: Working Magick\nWhat I look for: Voids that I can fill with something intellectually aesthetic. Tasks that I am uniquely in a position to solve. Riddles that demand pause, patience and hyper-focus. Manifestations of expertise that produce inner mini-celebrations. Artifacts that I can share with pride.\nPart of Being: Creative, Productive, Unique, Proud\n",

The methodology of learning we use is to grow personally and professionally, taking care of their wellbeing while developing their organization to create positive impact. We use character strengths to help them find meaning and their values as they show up in their work. Their signature strength, the strength that when they use it builds energy and doesn't drain them is usually in the top 10 list of their strengths. Then there are Universal Skills Our model is that people will grow in our PERMA wellbeing measures when they bring their values to life in development of skills. The universal skills assessment is a skills assessment, meaning it's developmental and can be improved. We don't encourage people to \"change\" their character strengths, only discover them and leverage their signature strengths to bring energy. There is also research which shows that bringing your signature strength to life helps wellbeing and brings vitality. This vitality and energy is helpful for learning difficult things including universal skills and business skills. This is how we grow personally and professionally simultaneously while developing in our wellbeing. Finally there are the skills to develop the business which we assess using the enterprise capacity assessment. You already know all these assessment results what activities would you recommend now that follow these 4 pillar assessment framework and methodology",

Smaller costs. We want to diversify our income stream and product offerings, Here's what we sell now. 100k and up programs or 4 months or more of acceleration which consist of open houses where we take the character strengths assessment and bring in the discussion of using strengths at work, we then do a sprint where then do the enterprise assessment and the universal skills assessment and where we help people develop their pitch and select people for the acceleration phase. Importantly part of our selection is how community oriented people are and how often people said they are helpful. This is part of our framing of a more friendly collaborative supportive environment of learners of entrepreneurship, then they go to the accelerator and this is the longest and most expensive phase, we match them with mentors if we can (and we work to match everyone with high quality international mentors) and then encourage them to meet with them. Then we use the assessments and work with them to create a work plan with KPIs and use that work plan every two weeks to update the plan of action they want to do for those two weeks leveraging our digital assessment and intervention library, we pick activities together for them to do and monitor it every two weeks for the next 3-4 months. This is the phase where their activity plan is reviewed by their PM and mentors and they also can get money if the program has funds for project implementation  - then at the end we take assessments again to see how they grew and changed along the Enterprise capacities and Universal skills and PERMA and Character strengths - we write reports and encourage them to stay in touch with their mentors. This is the big 4 month acceleration program. What are potential service products we can derive from this robust system that we can sell to corporate clients in learning and development, or HR, or other departments we might not know. Different time scales and costs would be helpful. Are there any other sales opportunities or skills you think we can derive and monetize from the skills and digital technology of assessments and interventions library and todo list that we can spin off?

They allow you to gather important information about clients' strengths, weaknesses, and preferences, which can be used to create a more tailored and effective \"best next step\" service.\n\nFor data integration, you could use one of the following approaches:\n\n1. Low-cost, low human time: Use a service like Zapier to automate the transfer of data between the Bloom platform (MongoDB) and a Google Sheet or Airtable. This solution requires minimal setup and maintenance and can be done without significant technical expertise. People might be willing to pay around $50-$100 for a quarterly \"best next step\" service that offers basic insights and personalized recommendations.\n\n2. Moderate cost, moderate human time: Develop a custom API integration between the Bloom platform and your preferred data storage solution (e.g., Airtable or Google Sheets) to ensure seamless data transfer. This solution requires some technical expertise and might involve higher development costs, but it offers a more streamlined and professional experience for clients. For a more robust service that includes advanced insights, clients might be willing to pay around $100-$250 per quarter.\n\n3. Higher cost, higher human time: Create a stand-alone web app or chatbot that integrates directly with the Bloom platform, allowing clients to take assessments, receive personalized recommendations, and track their progress all in one place. This solution requires significant development time and resources but can provide the highest level of value and user experience. With this comprehensive service, clients might be willing to pay around $250-$500 per quarter, depending on the level of customization, support, and additional resources provided.\n\nWhen deciding on an approach, consider your budget, available resources, and the desired level of user experience you want to offer. Keep in mind that pricing should be based on the value provided to clients, the complexity of the service, and the level of support and personalization included.",

The arrows should have a modern, sleek look, and the design should incorporate a gradient or color transition to represent growth and progress. The main colors of the logo could be shades of green and blue, which are often associated with growth and trustworthiness, respectively.\n\nThe \"GrowthCompass\" text should be placed below the compass icon, with \"Growth\" in a slightly larger font size than \"Compass.\" The font should be modern, clean, and easy to read. Optionally, you could place the \".io\" in a smaller font size next to the \"Compass\" text or leave it out, depending on your preference.\n\nTo create this logo using p5.js, you will need to have knowledge of programming and the p5.js library.

First of all, not all corporate clients will be open to the idea of self-improvement and personal growth for their employees. They might see it as a waste of time and resources that could be better spent on hard skills training or direct work output.\n\nUser: I understand your concerns, but companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of investing in their employees' well-being and personal development. A well-rounded and engaged workforce is more productive, innovative, and less likely to leave the company. By offering this service, we're actually helping organizations save money in the long run by reducing turnover and improving overall performance.\n\nBlack Hat Teammate: Okay, but what about the scalability of the service? It seems like it would require a lot of individualized attention, which might not be feasible for larger organizations with hundreds or thousands of employees.\n\nUser: While it's true that individualized attention is essential for personal growth, our approach uses technology like AI and data analysis to scale the process. By leveraging these tools, we can provide tailored insights and recommendations to each employee, making it more feasible to handle larger client organizations.\n\nBlack Hat Teammate: Even if we can scale the service, there's still the issue of measuring success. How do we prove that our approach is effective and that it's worth the investment for our clients?\n\nUser: Measuring success is indeed crucial, and that's why we'll track various metrics such as employee engagement, job satisfaction, and performance improvements. We'll also monitor progress in the development of key skills, and provide regular reports to clients. This will demonstrate the effectiveness of our service and help them see the value of their investment.\n\nBlack Hat Teammate: Finally, there's a risk that the employees might not take the process seriously or engage with it wholeheartedly. If they don't buy into the idea, the entire service could be a waste of time and resources.\n\nUser: That's a valid concern, but our approach is designed to be engaging, fun, and easy to understand. By making the process enjoyable and relatable, we can encourage greater participation and genuine commitment from employees. Additionally, we'll work with our clients to promote the benefits of personal growth and create a supportive organizational culture that encourages employees to fully engage in the process.",

Measuring success: In addition to the metrics mentioned earlier, we can also consider implementing a more comprehensive evaluation framework, including qualitative assessments such as employee testimonials, surveys, and interviews. This will help us paint a more holistic picture of the impact of our services on employees and organizations, making it easier to demonstrate the return on investment.\n\n4. Employee engagement: To boost employee engagement, we can incorporate gamification elements, social interactions, and rewards into the process. By making the experience more interactive and rewarding, we can increase employee motivation to participate in the program. Additionally, offering regular feedback and recognition can further encourage employee commitment to personal growth and development.\n\n5. Limited capacity on our team: To address the concern of limited capacity, we can explore partnerships with other organizations, freelancers, or contractors who have the necessary expertise and resources to help build and expand the service. Alternatively, we can consider hiring additional team members or reallocating existing resources to focus on this project. Another option is to adopt a phased approach, starting with a smaller pilot project and gradually expanding the service as we gain more experience and resources.\n\nBy thoroughly addressing these concerns, we can build a more robust and convincing case for our services, demonstrating the value they can bring to clients and their employees.",

DOI: 10.1108/02683940610690169\n   - This research identified the factors that contribute to employee engagement and the positive outcomes that result from higher levels of engagement, such as increased job satisfaction, commitment, and performance.\n\nRegarding scalability, in the pilot phase, you can minimize the need for human intervention by automating emails and utilizing the Bloom platform. As you refine and scale the service, consider investing in more sophisticated AI and automation tools to further reduce the need for manual processes. This will enable you to manage a larger number of clients and employees without compromising the quality of the service.",

Familiarity: Since you're familiar with the institution and its culture, it may be easier for you to customize the program to address their specific needs and challenges.\n\n2. Existing connections: You may already have connections with faculty, staff, or alumni who could help you promote the program and gain buy-in from decision-makers.\n\n3. Relevance: As an educational institution, CRI-Paris is committed to fostering growth and learning, making them a natural fit for a program that emphasizes personal development and continuous improvement.\n\n4. Opportunity for collaboration: If the pilot is successful, there could be opportunities for ongoing collaboration between Bloom and CRI-Paris, such as incorporating the program into the curriculum, conducting joint research, or developing new educational initiatives.\n\nTo move forward with piloting the program at CRI-Paris, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Reach out to your connections at CRI-Paris to gauge their interest in participating in the pilot and gather their input on how the program could be tailored to their needs.\n\n2. Prepare a proposal or presentation that outlines the benefits and goals of the program, how it aligns with CRI-Paris's mission and values, and the pilot's timeline and logistics.\n\n3. Schedule a meeting with decision-makers at CRI-Paris to present your proposal and address any questions or concerns they may have.\n\n4. If the pilot is approved, work with your team to customize the program, set up the necessary tools and resources, and communicate with participants to ensure they understand the objectives and expectations.\n\n5. Launch the pilot, collect feedback, and closely monitor its progress to identify any areas for improvement or potential challenges that may arise.\n\n6. After the pilot is complete, evaluate its success, gather insights and lessons learned, and use this information to refine and expand the program for future clients.",

(leading the towards the core value)\nI’m thinking, how would improving your planning skill and your being realistic skill would affect this role.\nHow much when we are drawn to the plan and to the reality would prevent us from focusing on the core? V/S how much when we are too much focused on the core value would keep us stuck in a loop of iteration.\nSounds like we have some interesting material to discuss.\nBased on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth?\nGetting busy with new ideas and work with people directly.\n\nNext person, Dara, programs lead, sanguine personality, deep thinker, she was Bilal's previous mentee, the organized person creating lots of documentation and better at time management says this in response to the questions above:\nData analysis and research skills: We’ve been doing this in a bit of an ad-hoc way, and now, with Ghina’s skills and your brains (specifically imagination, ability to think abstractly and connect the dots in the bigger picture, and how you leverage technology), we can take it to the next level, and that can feed into our experiments and help us develop case studies, publish research, etc. This can also be a great combo because China is methodical and systematic and can help organize your experiments.\nHaving you lead more scientifically designed research more systematically and consistently can help us identify more effective ways to develop our programs and be more responsive to the needs of participants. This also makes sense because you’re always the first to share and distill external research so we can try new things. And it puts you back on the conference trail: as we publish more, you can go around and present findings, leading to more projects.\nBased on my experience working with you, I know you enjoy exploring new ideas and experimenting with new approaches. I also know that you think better in dialogue. So you may benefit from having a research buddy (Ghina) and an experimentation buddy (me and the PMs) to help put things into the action.\n\nNext person, Avery. Avery, a long time friend of Bilal's who is passionate about impact, arabic language, refugees, religious person, young, just out of college, works in bloom on the library, and grant and proposal writing, reliable. Avery says this about Bilal in response to the questions above:\nWhat specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process? Answer: I think that Bilal should work on qualitative analysis concepts so that he can guide Bloom's data collection and research efforts towards more actionable data outcomes. I think collaborating with our new M&E expert and taking on small data visualization projects would help him work towards this goal.\nAre there any challenges or opportunities within Bloom where you think Bilal’s strengths and expertise could be particularly valuable, and what actions should he take to address them? Answer: Bilal's emerging expertise with GPT and AI tools could help Bloom jump ahead of competitors. He should have space and support to implement new tools when possible.\nBased on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth? Answer: Bilal works best in conversation with other people, and he is inspired by experts and people who have thought deeply about subjects. Putting him in conversation with those experts would help him grow. The experts in the subjects he is most deeply interested in are typically located outside of Bloom.\n\nNext person, Mohammed. Mohammed is a coder at Bloom, he makes the software, he works with Bilal in designing features / new ideas. He is rational and logical. And Iraqi, English is his second language. This is how he answered the questions above about Bilal in an attempt to help you help identify the next best activities for learning and growth for Bilal.\n\nCan you take all this feedback into consideration, summarize in a table the new insights that you see here. You should see new insights because this is the first time you get 3rd party information from people not Bilal. After showing those new insights please offer new activities like the Role Playing Sales calls and others and give them in the most comprehensive structure as possible including a why. Thank you",

(leading the towards the core value)\nI’m thinking, how would improving your planning skill and your being realistic skill would affect this role.\nHow much when we are drawn to the plan and to the reality would prevent us from focusing on the core? V/S how much when we are too much focused on the core value would keep us stuck in a loop of iteration.\nSounds like we have some interesting material to discuss.\nBased on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth?\nGetting busy with new ideas and work with people directly.\n\nNext person, Dara, programs lead, sanguine personality, deep thinker, she was Bilal's previous mentee, the organized person creating lots of documentation and better at time management says this in response to the questions above:\nData analysis and research skills: We’ve been doing this in a bit of an ad-hoc way, and now, with Ghina’s skills and your brains (specifically imagination, ability to think abstractly and connect the dots in the bigger picture, and how you leverage technology), we can take it to the next level, and that can feed into our experiments and help us develop case studies, publish research, etc. This can also be a great combo because China is methodical and systematic and can help organize your experiments.\nHaving you lead more scientifically designed research more systematically and consistently can help us identify more effective ways to develop our programs and be more responsive to the needs of participants. This also makes sense because you’re always the first to share and distill external research so we can try new things. And it puts you back on the conference trail: as we publish more, you can go around and present findings, leading to more projects.\nBased on my experience working with you, I know you enjoy exploring new ideas and experimenting with new approaches. I also know that you think better in dialogue. So you may benefit from having a research buddy (Ghina) and an experimentation buddy (me and the PMs) to help put things into the action.\n\nNext person, Avery. Avery, a long time friend of Bilal's who is passionate about impact, arabic language, refugees, religious person, young, just out of college, works in bloom on the library, and grant and proposal writing, reliable. Avery says this about Bilal in response to the questions above:\nWhat specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process? Answer: I think that Bilal should work on qualitative analysis concepts so that he can guide Bloom's data collection and research efforts towards more actionable data outcomes. I think collaborating with our new M&E expert and taking on small data visualization projects would help him work towards this goal.\nAre there any challenges or opportunities within Bloom where you think Bilal’s strengths and expertise could be particularly valuable, and what actions should he take to address them? Answer: Bilal's emerging expertise with GPT and AI tools could help Bloom jump ahead of competitors. He should have space and support to implement new tools when possible.\nBased on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth? Answer: Bilal works best in conversation with other people, and he is inspired by experts and people who have thought deeply about subjects. Putting him in conversation with those experts would help him grow. The experts in the subjects he is most deeply interested in are typically located outside of Bloom.\n\nNext person, Mohammed. Mohammed is a coder at Bloom, he makes the software, he works with Bilal in designing features / new ideas. He is rational and logical. And Iraqi, English is his second language. This is how he answered the questions above about Bilal in an attempt to help you help identify the next best activities for learning and growth for Bilal.\nWhat are your top three personal and professional learning goals at this stage in your career?\nHow would you describe your current strengths and areas for improvement?\nWhich aspects of Bloom.pm's growth and development are you most directly involved in or responsible for?\nWhat are the main challenges or obstacles you and Bloom.pm are currently facing?\nHow do you see your role evolving within Bloom.pm in the near future?\nAre there any specific skills or knowledge areas you'd like to develop further to enhance your contributions to Bloom.pm?\nBased on your assessment results and the information provided so far, which activities from the list resonate the most with you and why?\nDo you have any preferences for the type of learning activity, such as reading, workshops, or online courses?\n\n1) I would like to become more of an expert in something rather than a generalist. I feel like I'm all over the place and I have a hard time being seen as a professional both for my own self image and externally. I need to make more money as. my wife is pregnant and we'll need to manage larger expenses. Professional learning, I would like to learn transferrable skills that make me competitive in the job market while also being a rockstar at my own organization, Bloom.\n2) I'm nerdy, great at research, I get lost on questions when they capture me like how should I use ChatGPT for work. And I ignore lots of important things that don't, which is a weakness. \n3. I am responsible at Bloom for our curriculum and training. I'm a facilitator of a new program. I am also attempting to identify new program styles that we can run faster and for different audiences. We run training programs that use assessments and libraries of interventions to help people grow personally and professionally. If you have ideas about how to use chat GPT in that instance, give me a prompt showing that.\n4. obstacles are that we need more clients, we are a nonprofit accelerator and our budgets are capped and we have a small amount of overhead for creativity, well-being activities at work, etc. We want corporate clients, or to sell the software we're making \n5. I see myself stabilizing the organization and being focused on research, creative work, values alignment, working on new financial models to support social enterprises, new program design to bring those financial models to life, etc.\n6. I want to learn more about economics and human values and international policy. I wonder if we can have a beautiful future of people living their values at work and also have the sort of scalable growth we have. Lots of question about meaning and money and life and death. \n7. I'm interested in practical things I can do that involve others, reading a book or doing an activity alone won't captivate me. I should do something where we can work together - perhaps online on a zoom call that will help me share my research and also help the team connect and overcome my problem of procrastination and continual research by allowing myself to work with people who have a different mindset, the fishing sort of mindset that turns ideas into done. That's the problem I'm facing, how to stop innovating and get things to done, especially get things to done that we can sell. I'm also scared to call people - that fear leads to procrastination.\n8. I prefer online courses and activities with great facilitation around areas I'm interested in. I also have a problem where I love reading yet I don't take good enough notes and even if I do I don't know how to turn notes into productive action for Bloom.\n",

I'm a facilitator of a new program. I am also attempting to identify new program styles that we can run faster and for different audiences. We run training programs that use assessments and libraries of interventions to help people grow personally and professionally.\nMeasures for growth are number of mentor matches, team skill development, number of teams working on different sdgs, post program growth in revenue for teams, activities done by teams to grow. We also measure number of teams on the platform. Active users.\nStrengths as a leader is my creativity, and my ability to excite people around a cause. I'm a good public speaker. Visionary. I also care about people\nWeaknesses as a leader, time management, delegation, procrastination, inability to make difficult phone calls\nI want you to help me find the right skills to develop and help me learn how. I want to learn the skills that I think will be innately and deeply meaningful, I can't learn something when I am not completely engaged in it.\nHopes for Bloom and myself is that bloom is a profitable social enterprise that it is making money and that I am personally financially well off as well. I see myself stabilizing the organization and being focused on research, creative work, values alignment, working on new financial models to support social enterprises, new program design to bring those financial models to life, etc.\nthe most meaningful parts of our culture is how kind and helpful we are, we are all mission driven and care about seeing our teams thrive. I love hearing our teams talk about how we create a positive impact in their lives and that they are very grateful for our support and that they can continue doing their impactful work because of our supportive community and funds.\nI think I don't know exactly my role at work so I work on everything and I am not sure how I am improving as a professional. I do growth and work on proposal writing, I do innovation and research on methods and data, I'm a facilitator yet I'm not \"advancing my career\" I'm doing all the things needed to help Bloom thrive and grow. Somehow I don't even know if I can focus, because if I did one thing I would find that I stagnate, waste time. I like being in many things although sometimes I can also be paralyzed because I don't know what's the priority thing to do. I'm a bit chaotic at work and miss opportunities, meetings, people asking me to review things, it's all a bit much...\n\n",

This information will help me better understand your needs and provide tailored support for your development. Based on the information you've provided, I have a few suggestions on how you can address some of the challenges you're facing and work on your growth.\n\n1. Time management and prioritization: One way to address your time management and prioritization challenges is to implement a daily or weekly planning routine. Start by setting clear goals and breaking them down into smaller, actionable tasks. Allocate time for each task and ensure that you're focusing on the most important ones first. You can use tools like Trello or Asana to keep track of your tasks and progress.\n\n2. Delegation: To improve your delegation skills, identify tasks that can be delegated to your team members based on their strengths and expertise. Communicate your expectations and deadlines clearly and provide the necessary resources and support for your team members to complete their tasks. Make sure to follow up regularly and provide feedback to help them improve.\n\n3. Procrastination: Overcoming procrastination can be achieved by breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps and setting deadlines for each step. This will help you feel less overwhelmed and more motivated to complete tasks. Additionally, you can try the Pomodoro Technique, where you work in focused intervals of 25 minutes, followed by a short break. This can help you maintain focus and productivity throughout the day.\n\n4. Professional development: To help you advance your career and develop the skills you're passionate about, consider creating a personal development plan. Identify the areas you want to focus on and set specific, achievable goals. Seek out resources such as online courses, workshops, and mentorship opportunities to help you achieve these goals. Engaging with experts and professionals in your areas of interest can also help you gain new insights and perspectives.\n\n5. Work-life balance: To maintain a healthy work-life balance, establish boundaries between your work and personal life. Schedule regular breaks, engage in activities you enjoy, and prioritize self-care. Implementing mindfulness techniques, such as meditation and journaling, can also help you manage stress and maintain a healthy mindset.\n\n6. Role clarity: To gain more clarity on your role at Bloom, consider having a conversation with your supervisor or other team members. Discuss your responsibilities, areas",

Based on the information you've provided, here are some suggestions for your development:\n\n1. Time management and prioritization: Since you mentioned struggling with time management, procrastination, and prioritization, it would be beneficial for you to develop these skills. You could explore time management techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique or the Eisenhower Matrix to help you focus and prioritize tasks. Additionally, consider setting clear goals and breaking them down into smaller tasks to make them more manageable.\n\n2. Delegation: As a leader, it's essential to delegate tasks effectively, especially when managing multiple responsibilities. Learn how to delegate tasks based on your team members' strengths and interests. This will not only free up your time for more strategic and high-impact activities but also help your team members grow professionally.\n\n3. Communication: Develop your communication skills to improve your ability to make difficult phone calls and have tough conversations. You can practice assertive communication techniques or role-play difficult conversations with a trusted colleague or friend to build confidence.\n\n4. Collaboration: Leverage the strengths of your team members by collaborating more closely with them. This will help you tackle challenges more effectively and capitalize on the diverse skill sets within your team. For example, collaborate with Ghina on data analysis and research, and work with Dara and other Program Managers on experimentation and program development.\n\n5.

Consider enrolling in online courses or workshops, attending conferences, or joining relevant professional groups to expand your knowledge in these areas.\n\n6.

Networking can also help you identify potential clients and business opportunities.\n\n7. Work-life balance and well-being: Reflect on your ideal work-life balance and implement strategies to achieve it. Consider setting boundaries, prioritizing self-care, and adopting healthy habits to maintain your well-being.\n\n8.

The universal skills category measures core abilities relevant to any professional role, such as listening, aiming high, teamwork, and communication. The enterprise capacity category, on the other hand, evaluates skills specific to managing and leading a successful organization, including product and service development, marketing, financial management, and strategic planning.\n\nKey challenges for Bilal, as identified by his colleagues and self-assessment, include time management, delegation, and procrastination. To address these challenges, Bilal would benefit from learning techniques and strategies to better prioritize tasks, effectively delegate responsibilities to team members, and overcome the tendency to put off crucial tasks.\n\nBloom faces its own set of challenges, such as securing more clients and diversifying their funding sources. As a nonprofit organization, financial stability is essential for Bloom to continue providing support to social enterprises. Expanding their client base and attracting a diverse range of funding sources would allow them to grow and further their mission.\n\nWe discussed three potential learning activities for Bilal's personal and professional growth, designed to address his identified challenges and help him become a more effective leader within Bloom:\n\n1. Time management workshop: Participating in a workshop focused on time management techniques would help Bilal establish priorities, set achievable goals, and allocate his time more efficiently.\n\n2. Leadership coaching: Engaging in leadership coaching sessions would allow Bilal to develop his delegation skills, learn how to empower team members, and create a more balanced distribution of responsibilities within the organization.\n\n3. Peer accountability group: Joining a peer accountability group could help Bilal overcome procrastination by setting clear deadlines, sharing progress updates with peers, and receiving encouragement and motivation from fellow professionals.\n\nBilal has expressed a preference for interactive learning experiences and working with others. As such, the suggested activities have been tailored to incorporate these preferences, ensuring that Bilal remains engaged and motivated throughout his personal and professional development journey. By addressing his key challenges and fostering growth in his identified areas for improvement, Bilal will be better equipped to help Bloom overcome its own challenges and continue to make a positive impact on the social enterprises they support.",
