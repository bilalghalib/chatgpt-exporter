Next time, I'll buy a bigger bottle.\"\n-Robert Adan on Oct 6, 2016\n\n\"Amazing product from an amazing seller. I was excited to try the scent of petrichor after everything I had read about it, and to my delight it really does smell like fresh soil after a rain, or even the hot cobbled streets of Paris in the summer after a summer rain, very soothing. \"\nfleurdodd on Sep 23, 2016\n\n\nI love this scent. It's a natural extract made from only one lake in Kannauj India. A summer storm in a bottle! The monsoons clearing the dust from the streets in india. This scent has many names -- petrichor, mitti, geosmine -- and Kannuaj is the only place in the world that I have found that extracts it naturally.\n\nIf you've ever tried CB I Hate Perfume's Soaked Earth accord, this smells vastly different. Less humus and more pavement during a summer shower. \n\nThis is rare stuff indeed and we bring it directly to you!\n\n\nAll of our oils are made using natural ingredients using traditional extraction methods. We source them ourselves from Kannauj India a city known to have been producing essential oils for the last 7000 years! The images above are from the factory visit in October 2015.

Smells just like dust after rain. The package was later than expected but that's fine. I got white lotus as a sample and was in love instantly, will be ordering it soon\nI purchased 5g instead of 3g this time and turns out it comes in the same bottle! This is what it looks like! Great scent— though it is a little weaker than the last batch I ordered. I mentioned this to the seller, and they were so kind and offered me a refund! I look forward to purchasing this item again in the future (hopefully it will be a bit stronger next time though!) Smells like rain!\n\nEmma L.W Feugen Mar 28, 2022\nEmma L.W Feugen added a photo of their purchase\n4 out of 5 stars     \nThe smell is absolutely amazing - truly smells like petrichor - and totally worth it! The picture is misleading because it’s a REALLY small bottle. Shipping took significantly longer than I expected, but I wasn’t in a rush. Would buy again.\n\ndavisacupuncture Jul 9, 2021\n5 out of 5 stars     \nAbsolutely LOVE this, and the seller was so kind when I got my little note in the envelope, thank you for the little surprise! Made my day :)\n\nBronwyn Conway May 4, 2021\n3 out of 5 stars     \nListing review by Kail\nSlightly disappointed, wanted a rainy smell. Floral vibes, even a bit of cologne vibes as well. But petrichor was not the vibe unfortunately. A bit pricey for a tiny bottle. But I’m happy to give it to a friend who enjoys the smell! I will say, the seller is incredibly nice and the packaging was great!\nSo excited to get my hands (and nose) on this, after only reading about it. I've always loved the smell of a sidewalk just as the rain begins to fall—it's this smell! Beautiful packaging, speedy delivery, and delicious sample. Thank you!\nVanessa Apr 3, 2022\n5 out of 5 stars     \nJust perfect. It smells just like the earth after a rainy morning. It's exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!!!\nKaren Aug 31, 2021\n5 out of 5 stars     \nListing review by Heather Nicole\nI’m updating my review from my initial post. Like anything you purchase online that has a scent you haven’t smelled, you don’t know what it smells like until it arrives. While the scent was not what I was expecting, I know it’s a great product. I would highly recommend this shop simply for the excellent customer service you will receive (even if you don’t communicate with someone. It is the best I’ve experienced on Etsy…and I’ve made numerous purchase on here for almost 15 years Hands down, you have the best customer service I’ve experienced on Etsy.\n\nResponse from Nur Coop\nHeather, you are so kind and we're happy we were able to make it right. It's our goal to spread beauty and kindness and it's so easy when we connect with people like you :)\n\nHeather Nicole Jan 30, 2023\n5 out of 5 stars     \nI’m buying again because the geosmin smell is just that good!! Perfectly earthy, touch of smoke, reminds me of India. Great packaging too!\nMaybe you can include something about our reviews in summary",

      "content": " Here's some language that you can use to make the tone sound more like us, also keep in mind the SEO and sales and keep it sounding authentic like we wrote it: \nWhat is Nur Creative Studios? Why does it exist?\n\nWarning, this is a bit of a long read and is a thesis on why I want to run a business. I hope to get feedback and polish this till it includes all our ideas and visions.\n\nPlease read this and tell me at the end, why are you here?\n\nTrying to simplify what Nur Creative Studios aims to:\nCreate products which give people a sense of the sublime.\nRun a company that is fueled by baraka, so that the work we do is blessed and so that the money we make is also blessed. \n\"Good Globalization\" - connect a the planet through our products by collaborating with crafts people from around the world. \nCreate quality products that help people know themselves, each other, and know how the world works. How amazing is that?\nCreate a vehicle through which we meaning for the employees, partner producers, and customers.\n\nOnce upon a time, 10 years ago, we started a creative studio called Modati. Our goal was simple. To make money doing what we love. But that's too simple, what does making money mean - what does \"doing what we love\" mean?\n\nWe must expand the idea of making money to mean something bigger than collecting green stuff and for it to mean that we thrive participating in a collaborative global economy. And by \"doing what we love\" means to: using my strengths to offer value to others, and to challenge myself to grow more so I can give more.\n\nLet's try to simplify that. NCS is a company through which I can grow more so I can serve more. When I serve more, I earn more. I earn more to help others serve and create. I know my satisfaction does not come from \n\nNur Creative Studios was born from the desire to connect to the divine* through our senses. We create products to know that God did not create humanity to suffer, but to delight in our senses and knowing. We create experiences of beauty that transcend the aesthetic and moves us through awe and wonder to know the divine. \n\nWhat does that even mean, Bilal? Well, what I'm trying to say is that every time you smell a beautiful flower and smile, there's god* waving at you smiling back. \n\nTo make sure our products are able to evoke a divine sense of beauty we must ensure that no negativity enters them from any channel. That means that our production line must be full of baraka, so that our products are full of baraka, so that we are funded by money that's blessed. That means we pay everyone respectfully. That means we respect every hand that has to put effort to make our products. That means we respect our customers and charge fair prices. \n\nAnother principle element of the brand is beautiful globalization. A form of globalization that focuses on appreciation of differences rather than creating a bland culture that is the same all over the world. We are an international team, working with international crafts people many of whom have been working on these traditional crafts for their whole lives, in cities known for the crafts for thousands of years. Let's use an international product to demonstrate the long history and beauty of different parts of the world. This globalization helps people travel without leaving their countries. \n\nThat leads us to travel. Travel helps one to see and learn how other people live, to understand the integrated nature of the world, and to hopefully, learn to accept the other. This is another form of beauty, and another way of demonstrating the unity of mankind, which is a mirror of the unity of divinity*. We help connect people and the world by telling compelling stories. And by LITERALLY bringing parts of one world and taking it to another. It's different than a photo, a scent is much more visceral and substantial.\n\nAnother element of a beautiful company is what we do with the profits. I want some of our profits to go to mitigating any negative affects our business could be having in terms of resources being utilized. So reforesting for the paper and trees we use for instance. I want to have some resources for new product development, exploring new materials and research, and \n\nI want to have no death on my hands, which means that everyone that works on nuries should feel like they are challenged, growing (positive pain), and happily engaged using their strengths - rather than trying to bolster a weakness or like they are compensated inappropriately.\n\nI thought we just buy and sell oils. - No, we make friends around the world, we highlight the efforts of crafts people, we make the argument that meaning is our job. \n\nCompanies evolve, their missions change, the people decide. I'm sharing my values and missions and open to hear from you how you want to create this thing. Having a creative studio like this allows us to explore the world, create value, share with others. We get to understand ourselves through sharing the things we make. \n\nI hope this adventure grows with us. I hope to hear from you why you are here. What you would like to explore. What your strengths are. What would you like to contribute. How can NCS be helpful for you in achieving your goals? What time do you have to offer to this initiative?\n\nHope you're all doing lovely and please tell us all... \"what are you doing here?\"\nWhat are your thoughts on economics, sustainable planets, sustainable living, how a business should be run, what products you want to create, what you have to offer in service to the world.\n",

Thank you for the rose attar\n\nWandering Malak Dec 10, 2021\n5 out of 5 stars     \nListing review by Laura\nBeautiful scent! To me, it brings back memories of hot pavement at the playground when the first few raindrops hit. As the product description mentions, it’s not a “forest floor” scent you might smell foraging for mushrooms after a storm, but it’s its own gorgeous scent. Great oil for pairing in candles!\n\nLaura Feb 17, 2021\n5 out of 5 stars     \nI super love it!!! This is wet soil!!! I totally recommend this product.\nlamarycarmen Apr 13, 2021\n5 out of 5 stars     \nReally very nice and perfect!\nIn love with this oil! I can't describe exactly how it smells... \"nature\", \"wild\", \"organic\". But it smells wonderful on me! Excellent packaging and shipping. Thank you!\n\nGrace Singing Jan 26, 2022\n5 out of 5 stars     \nI used this to develop a new cocktail called Rain On The Patio.

I got it from 2 places, and the scent of this one was very subtle and natural, delightful and authentic. It did have the subtle musty scent of rain on earth, that I was hoping for. The other that I got was close, but not quite. So I would definitely recommend NurCreativStudio as a source. i\nSuzanne Farris Jul 1, 2021\n5 out of 5 stars     \nEarthy and warm, perfect while listening to summer sounds on a cold winter day. The Champaka sample is exquisite. Will be looking at that one again! Thank you.\nEarthy and ethereal. Evocative of a time of primal grace...a FAVORITE!\nPamela Hollins Feb 4, 2021\n1 out of 5 stars     \nthe contents leaked out in transit. the seller sent a sample in addition but it must have leaked out as well because it was empty when it arrived. I wasted money because the seller did not use secure caps. A disappointment all in all.\ndebra shidler Sep 11, 2021\n3 out of 5 stars     \nListing review by cuisinesol\nI think everyone experiences smells differently, and there are many different types of petrichor, but to me this didn't remind me of the earth after rain. It smells more like wet clay, which is fine but I didn't expect that. It doesn't work on my skin so I just smell it from the jar (which is absolutely tiny but I should've really checked the volume properly before buying).\n\ncuisinesol Aug 15, 2021\n4 out of 5 stars     \nListing review by Ivel Gontan\nEdited review: they were kind enough to refund my purchase even after a snarky review. Classy seller. My bad on not being hip to what I’ve gram looks like. The oil took a long time to arrive but as soon as I sent a msg I was explained the cause, can't wait to receive it!\nSee in original language\nManon Caly Jun 19, 2021\n2 out of 5 stars     \nit was my bad, i thought it would smell more like the air when it rains rather than literal soil. still a 10/10 product though, much love to the company!!\nmorgan May 8, 2021\n5 out of 5 stars     \nThe fragrance is exactly what I was looking for. Very thoughtful seller. I definitely recommend them.\n\nGigi Lollo Apr 14, 2021\n5 out of 5 stars     \nThank you so much for my petrichor oil. You're the only one who has it! It's a thick consistency, that's how you know it's extremely good!\nThe scent is too earthy of a petrichor for me. But the packaging, bottle, and shipping time were great. Shopping for scents online is just impossible. But that’s alright.\n\nIsabella Feb 25, 2022\n5 out of 5 stars     \nsmall problem on the product ...

Our customers loved it so much that we returned to this same soap maker on our most recent trip to purchase this pure oil. The orange blossom oil is steam distilled from local tress. It is often used in soaps, candles, perfumes, and for home remedies. A little bit goes a long way!\n\nHere’s what one customer had to say about our orange blossom oil: “Amazing. Yum. So delightful to wear. People smell it on me when I wear one drop, and they ask about it. I’ll be back. It’s wonderful.”\n\nTravel with us to Lebanon and smell the world!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP66aRfCpB4\n\nDue to cost constraints, our 1g bottles are shipped without tracking when purchased alone.\n\nOur neroli has received 27 reviews\n5 stars\n100%\nsome reviews:\nThe neroli is so vibrant and delicious--I adore it and am immediately transported to a sunny climate :) The rose attar is more subtle than expected ( almond oil base) but still bright and beautiful... I might add it to a bath as opposed to using it as a perfume. I got these as the 3 grams. The smaller 1g are lavender and ylang ylang which are also lovely. Ylang ylang is very deep and sensual. This was shipped incredibly fast: only one week from France to Toronto! Extra bonus the packaging was plastic free and adorable. I received a little perfume sample too. Thanks Bilal and Josephine!\njemmybeans Dec 7, 2021\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars     \nListing review by Jenna Ferone\nWhen I finally opened my package, the Neroli was the only one without a label and I was concerned I had received something else (see photo). But after opening the bottle there was no mistake it was the right scent. It reminds of driving through the orange groves during wintertime in Florida! Other neroli I've smelled has never come quite close but this one is a winner! *It took four weeks from payment to receiving the mail (France to PA). I suspect COVID during the holiday season is the reason. I also stopped receiving shipping updates once it reached NY.\n\nJenna Ferone Dec 14, 2020\n\n\n5 out of 5 stars     \nListing review by Kaitlyn\nAbsolutely perfect! I have tried multiple times to find Orange Blossom sent for my Mother who remembers Florida from her childhood. After many disappointments I gave her this one today and she just smiled and said \"This is it\". thank you so much, I love it! Also it arrived in a very timely manner\nKaitlyn Apr 29, 2022\n5 out of 5 stars     \nListing review by NicNacFlicFlac\nNice light scent, they also added in a sample oil. Great price for the amount given, I was expecting 10mL but got 10gr which made me think it was not absolute. Florals are just lighter in scent. I reached out to them with my concern, they quickly responded and did everything possible to explain and make sure I was satisfied. It does ship out from France and not New York, there is some confusion here in the checkout process. I know int'l sellers have trouble with accounts on Etsy when they travel, which is the case here I believe. Shipped out on last day of processing estimate timeframe, then took about a week and a half to get to Toronto from France.\nWonderful orange blossom oil! One of the best I've ever come across. Definitely recommended!\n\nK. R. Feb 21, 2018\n5 out of 5 stars     \nEverything from this shop smells heavenly. The package was beautifully presented! Wonderful customer service and a bonus sample of Jasmine. Thank you so much!\nKerry Feb 28, 2022\n5 out of 5 stars     \nI love it. The smell reminds me of Florida and its orange blossoms. Thank you!\nSee in original language\nJacqueline Ouellet Sep 18, 2020\n5 out of 5 stars     \nThis is another beautiful fragrance of yours. It is long lasting and gorgeous. Thank you.\nBy far one of the highest quality essential oils I've ever purchased! Put a few drops in my ceramic oil lamp and my entire apartment smells like rich orange blossom. Also came with a sample fragrance that also smells amazing! <3<3<3<3<3<3\n\nL Russell Mar 9, 2021\n5 out of 5 stars     \nJust amazing. I think I'm addicted to this lovely scent.
