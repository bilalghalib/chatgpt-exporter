Thus, the evaluation provides insights into the program’s impact on the resulting outcomes of the implemented approach and mitigation measures. The evaluation covers the program's entire implementation period. Specifically, AltCity Impact/Bloom’s improvement of best practices following the mid-program evaluation, completed on January 31, 2022. \nAdditionally, the evaluation assesses the Theory of Change and if the fundamental assumptions supporting it are still valid in light of the changing circumstances. \nThis evaluation covers the Youth Entrepreneurship & Employability Accelerators Program (YEEAP), which has three main outcomes:  \nAn effective community of practice (Training Partners and MSMEs) with improved capacities supports MSMEs to operate in complex economic environments\nCapable MSMEs operate successfully in complex economic environments\nAltCity Impact / Bloom.org with strengthened organizational abilities to deliver sustained and growing economic impact for MSMEs in complex environments\nOverall, the AltCity Impact/Bloom successfully met its targets in all the outcomes despite the challenging times and crises the country has been going through in the past two years.\nOur evaluation looked at not only the ToC, methodology, and indicators but also the overall program. It evaluated it at a programmatic and operational level to provide findings and recommendations for future programming.\nA dedicated section is provided at the end with the recommendations for RDPP and AltCity Impact/Bloom to consider and build on for even more effective, efficient, impactful, and sustainable programming in the future.\n\nMethodology  \nBuilding on previous similar projects and per the requirements, the evaluators adopted a participatory mixed methods approach to producing the required deliverables. This includes a desk review and qualitative and quantitative data collection.  We collected input from all stakeholders and analyzed them to generate the necessary findings and recommendations.\nThe evaluation was conducted over four main stages: \n\n\nII.1 Phase One – Desk Review\n\nIn this phase, the team of researchers reviewed the relevant project documents including:\nInitial TOR (to extract the intended goals from the program)\nProject’s Vision and Mission\nProject’s Theory of Change \nProject proposals and narrative reports (prepared during the duration of the project)\nProject’s Logical Framework\nProject’s MEAL Plan and PITT Sheet\nJob Desegregation data\nThe Quarterly Information Note (Start of the Project - Cut off September 30, 2022)\nAC_PWorg YEEA Annual Report 3 (2022-08-20 - shared) - Copy for RPS\nContact lists for the evaluation\n\nFour sets of tools were developed and presented in the following sections to be addressed to 1) enterprises, 2) training partners, 3) mentors, and 4) the team members.\n\nII.2 Phase Two - Data Collection \nThe team, the network members’ input, and the beneficiaries’ were collected via a questionnaire to extract quantifiable indices to measure relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency levels. \nThe data collection method includes two steps: 1. digitization of the questionnaire and the dissemination of the questionnaire link via emails; 2. researchers collected the responses while maintaining the respondents’ anonymity and confidentiality.\n\nSampling strategy: Given that the number of enterprises, training partners, mentors, and team members was attainable, four surveys were distributed to all members to solicit their opinion via the questionnaire. To boost the response rate from the MSMEs and to attain unbiased input. To boost the MSMEs' response rate and to validate the number of jobs created, the RPS team contacted, surveyed, and interviewed the MSMEs via several ways (rounds). Accordingly, 39 MSMEs filled out the survey (on which we built the statistical figures) and 2 joined the discussions, hence a total of 42 MSMEs participated in this evaluation, whereas 7 MSMEs did not (did not fill the survey, nor respond to any of the 3 follow emails, nor answered any of the phone calls, nor participate in the FGD or interviews). Based on the results of the surveys, follow-up interviews were held with each group to explain further the findings.\n\nTable 1 Summary Table of the Groups and the Response Rates\nGroup                 Tool\nSurveys (Response Rate)\nInterviews (Response Rate)\nMSMEs \n39 (80%)\n36 (73%)\nTraining Partners\n5 (83%)\n5 (83%)\nMentors\n4 (22%)\n4 (22%)\nTeam Members\n5 (42%)\n3 (25%)\n\n\n\n\nII.3 Phase Three - Data Cleaning, Findings, and Analysis\nQualitative\nThe RPS Team stored all notes from the interviews on a secured drive. In addition, the notes were reviewed and validated to ensure the quality and accuracy of the information.\nThe team used a content analysis approach and was able to delve into the details and triangulate the results of the survey and desk review.\n\nQuantitative\nThe team provided data from the surveys into standard Microsoft Excel format. Then the team did a round of data cleansing and validation to ensure that the data collected was valid and valuable.\nAccordingly, the team generated the statistical findings and relevant artifacts such as pivots, tables, cross tabs, and charts to present the results appropriately.\nII.4 Phase Four Final Report\nThe findings, analysis, and recommendations resulted from the triangulation of the findings collected via the literature review, and the qualitative and quantitative data. Although some of the interviews were administered in Arabic, this final evaluation report is entirely in English. The information is organized as followed:\nExecutive summary     \nMethodology\nThe Evaluation\nConclusions and recommendations  \nAppendices\nThe Evaluation\nThis assessment is aligned with the OECD evaluation criteria of: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability, and coherence. In the end, the evaluators proceed with the evaluation in that order and conclude it with the lessons learned to pave the way for future planning.\nIII.1 About the MSMEs \nA substantial positive impact was notable on all the participating MSMEs in the Lebanese Growth Accelerator (LGA) implemented by Bloom (an affiliate of AltCity). The MSMEs came from different sectors and backgrounds such as: agro-food, manufacturing, crafts, design, technology, and other sectors. The MSME owners’ age distribution are mainly in their youth or prime age (47% between 18 and 31 years old, 32% between 32 and 45 years old, and the rest above 45 years old). Additionally, there is gender inclusion among the founders of the MSMEs participating in the project, with 49% males and 51% females. \n\nThe MSMEs joined the LGA program via different outreach channels, mainly via the call for MSMEs issued by the Bloom team. Around 47% of the participants in this evaluation indicated joining the program through applying. The other three channels are; 1. a contact person who introduced them to the Bloom team (21%), 2. one of the implementing partners (16%), and 3. some were contacted by the Bloom team (16%).\n\nIII.2 Relevance \nThere is an agreement among the Bloom team members, the mentors, and the participants (MSMEs) that the LGA project aligns with Bloom’s vision and mission from one side and is relevant to the needs of the MSMEs from another. The details relevant to the MSMEs’ perceptions are reported under the decent jobs criteria section. This evaluation shows that the LGA project aligns with Bloom’s vision and mission over three main fronts. First, the LGA project succeeded in enrolling, training, and supporting 49 MSMEs in the program. Second, the LGA project uses the online modality to increase the opportunities for discussion, community exchange, and support. Third, this program succeeded in capacitating the MSMEs, each in the area of their need. This helped them unveil new income opportunities and create at least 564 short-term, part-time, and full-time jobs for refugees and marginalized communities. In total, 514 positions were filled by Lebanese (males and females) and 50 positions by refugees (males and females). The modality of the employment varied from short-term, to part-time, to full-time, depending on the capacity of the MSMEs to retain the new labor. \n\n\n\nThe MSMEs indicated that the LGA program is relevant to their needs regarding the training topics, the supporting material and tools, and the connections with the trainers and coaches. Figure 1, shows on a Likert scale from 1 (minimum relevance) to 5 (maximum relevance), that the perceived reliance level by the MSMEs ranges between 4.44 and 4.53, meaning high relevance level. The areas of improvement are discussed in the effectiveness sections below.  \nJobs Creation Validation: The desk review and interviews with the Bloom team revealed that their validation method for the reported jobs is over two steps. At the end of each program cycle, Bloom program managers share a form with the MSMEs that have completed the cycle to understand the impact of the LGA program on the growth of their enterprises. In addition to the basic identification information asked in the form, they invite the MSMEs to share their enterprises’ growth stage, average monthly revenue, jobs created, position type, gender, age, and employee status. After filling out the form, the Bloom team validates the data at two levels. \nThe Bloom team addresses the possibility of human error by comparing the total value shared by the enterprise for a specific field concerning the disaggregation count of the value. For example, if the enterprise reports ten full-time jobs created but the disaggregation accounts for nine jobs, they would contact the enterprise to clarify. \nSecond, they cross-reference the validated data with the work plan, and budget templates the MSMEs complete during the program implementation to ensure that they meet their targeted employment objectives using the allocated budget. \nFor this evaluation, the RPS team ran another data verification method by contacting each MSME to collect the exact number of jobs created, retained, and unfilled jobs, if any. The validation process confirms the retention of 140 jobs created for the Lebanese and 24 for the Refugees. The retention rate of Lebanese workers is 56%, and that of Syrians is 38%. The following two tables show the number of MSMEs supported by each training partner and the corresponding job retention rate.\n\nTable 2 Distribution of the MSMEs participating in this Evaluation per Partner\nNumber of MSMEs Supported by Each Training Partner \nBloom\n17\n44%\nCentre Mine\n5\n13%\nCewas\n2\n5%\nLAU Innovate\n1\n3%\nMade by Nature\n5\n13%\nmakesense\n2\n5%\nNucleus Ventures\n7\n18%\nTotal\n39\n100%\n\n\nTable 3 Reported hired and retained workers by the Participating MSMEs\nPartner \nLebanese\nSyrians \nBloom\n78\n56%\n12\n50%\nCentre Mine\n21\n15%\n6\n25%\nCewas\n3\n2%\n2\n8%\nLAU Innovate\n0\n0%\n \n \nMade by Nature\n11\n8%\n \n \nmakesense\n7\n5%\n2\n8%\nNucleus Ventures\n20\n14%\n2\n8%\nTotal\n140\n100%\n24\n100%\n\n\nTherefore, the LGA program is vital for the participating MSMEs and many others to survive those crises in Lebanon. It also helps them remain in the market until the economy stabilizes and allows them to grow and develop. Hence, the LGA program is 1) highly needed for the MSMEs in Lebanon and 2) well associated with the overall objective “to enable MSMEs with the support of national partners, and to maintain and create new employment opportunities within the complex economic environment.” \n\n",

      "content": "IIII.3 Effectiveness\nOn the planning Level\nOne point highlighted and confirmed by both mentors and MSMEs is the divergence in the capacities and needs between the MSMEs in terms of levels and sectors. Hence, their needs differed considerably, which in turn varied their perceptions on the effectiveness of the activities, specifically the training and mentoring sessions. Thus, planning a different training modality (more tailored programs, homogeneous group of MSMEs or mentoring approaches) was recommended during the interviews and focus group discussions with the MSMEs and mentors. Furthermore, the MSMEs, training partners, and mentors agreed the grant phases needed more time.\nOn the implementation level \nRegarding the implementation of the activities, there is a positive satisfaction from the designed activities. Overall, the level of satisfaction exceeds 68% of the MSMEs. This evaluation shows that the MSMEs need further support in financial management and in securing future funds. The interviews and discussions with the MSMEs and the mentors revealed the gap in the mentoring sessions. Both parties believe that more could be done if the approach for the mentoring sessions was different. While the MSMEs appreciate all the efforts, support, and time provided by the mentors; a more guided, organized, and intensive structure for these sessions would have been more effective. Furthermore, there were repeated comments on matching the mentor (expert) and the MSMEs from both the MSMEs and the mentors. In some cases, the mentors felt helpless as the MSMEs’ needs differed from their area of expertise, so they tried their best to research the information or ask other members in their network to provide plans or answers to the MSMEs. Thus, the need for creating bonding and lineage among LGA mentors was highlighted in the discussion. Instead of referring to their contacts and lose time searching for experts, the mentors could communicate with each other to support each other. Another insight is that the MSME founders felt more knowledgeable than the mentors, and hence little value was added to the process. Therefore, reconsidering the modality of the mentoring sessions could lead to better results. \nFigure 2 LGA Program Activities Rating by the MSMEs\n\nEffectiveness of the Activities\nThis evaluation confirms the relevance of the activities of the LGA program to the needs of the MSMEs with a variation among the participants about their effectiveness. As for the types of activities designed, there were different views regarding the library, the platform, and the training sessions. However, there was a more unified opinion regarding the mentoring sessions.\nThe E-library: Some MSMEs and partners valued the information made available on the e-library and relied on it within their exit strategy with the MSMEs. The E-library provides the MSMEs with access to information even after the end of the project. As mentioned by some of the partners “The library and the knowledge available being offered by Bloom is very generous and interesting. The platform and the unified tools and those elements that unify work and produce data and results. It also gives good online networking capabilities. Library was overall rich. The Tools (eCAT) and others were very useful.”   Others did not make much use of it as they perceive it as work in progress and not sure how valid the data shared is and there is also the issue of sharing their own valuable information for free. “We didn’t utilize it much. We know that it has a lot of content, but there is an issue of trust that it is credible and sustainable as a platform.\nPlus having to populate this database with valuable content, it needs to be well thought of, developed and paid for.”\nThe Platform: The platform received high approval from almost all MSMEs participating in this study (74%). This was in terms of commenting, consuming content on the forum or participating in a workshop or discussion. Areas of improvement would include transforming the platform into a more user-friendly navigation system.\nOnline training Sessions: The online training sessions allowed many MSMEs to benefit from the sessions because they were held remotely, especially during the fuel crisis and inflation crisis. Thus, online training was vital in many MSMEs (84%) attending. One drawback of the online training sessions is the online fatigue that many people experienced in the last phase and the lack of face-to-face interaction that a few mentioned would boost the learning experience.\nTable 4 Trainings Modality per Partner\nPartners\nAll Online\nHybrid (mix between online and face to face)\nBloom\n16\n45.71%\n1\n25.00%\nCentre Mine\n5\n14.29%\n\n\n\n\nCewas\n2\n5.71%\n\n\n\n\nLAU Innovate\n1\n2.86%\n\n\n\n\nMade by Nature\n2\n5.71%\n3\n75.00%\nmakesense\n2\n5.71%\n\n\n\n\nNucleus Ventures\n7\n20.00%\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n35\n100.00%\n4\n100.00%\n\n\nDuring the interview, some of the participants (MSMEs) in the evaluation noted that having more customized training sessions tailored to their needs would be more beneficial. For instance, some MSMEs are pretty advanced and do not need pitching sessions but instead need marketing strategies and outreach. Others valued the pitching training sessions and needed more advanced sessions.(Refer to the appendix for the detailed courses distribution from most beneficial to least  per sector and per partner).\n In sector lens analysis, the RPS team divided the MSMEs into seven sectors.  The findings showed that all participating MSMEs benefitted from the capacity building since the rate is over 4 (on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is a minimum benefit and 5 is a maximum benefit). Specifically, the MSMEs in the technology and e-commerce, renewables and environmental sector, real estate, and construction sectors were to benefit the most (score 5); next, come the MSMEs in the agriculture, food, and beverages sector (4.33) and the healthcare sector (4.2). Comparatively, the MSMEs in the design, gifting, and education sectors benefitted less than the previously mentioned sectors (4.2 and 4.0, respectively).\n\nThe Mentoring Sessions: There is a variation in the responses among the MSMEs and the mentors regarding the mentoring sessions. Among the highlights of the comments is to reconsider the matching criteria between the mentor and the MSMEs. Many mentors feel unable to properly support the MSMEs whose needs do not fit the mentor’s expertise. Similarly, some MSMEs felt more experienced than the mentor and could not benefit appropriately from this activity. \n\nTo a certain extent, the order was reversed compared to the training session input. The MSMEs that benefitted the most (score =5) were in the real estate and construction sector, the health care. Next, those in the renewables and environment (4.33), education (4), and design and gifting (4). The coaching sessions had a lower benefit rate, especially for MSMEs in the agriculture, food, and beverage sector (3.86) and the lowest (3.8) in the technology and e-commerce sector.\nThe Grant: The grant is significant in supporting the initiatives and it was one of the incentives for many MSMEs to join the LGA program. Moreover, the program helped almost all MSMEs to hire the needed workers they need via the financial support. Only 1 MSME from the participating 39 indicated that the program did not help.\n\nJobs Creation Insights\nThe information in the following section is based on the input from the 39 MSMEs that participated in this evaluation via filling out the survey, the focus group discussions, the one-on-one interviews, and the follow-up phone calls.\n\nOnly 33% of the MSMEs provided health care insurance to their Lebanese workers, and only 8% provided health care insurance to their Syrian workers. For the MSMEs that didn’t, several reasons played a role, such as “cannot afford it,” “not being required by the program,” or “the worker did not ask for it” (see tables below). Similarly, for the transportation fees, 33% offer transportation fees for the full-timer Lebanese workers, and 5% compensate \n\n\ntheir Syrian full-time workers. The part-time workers/temporary workers are not receiving transportation fees, as reported by the MSMEs. Other reasons for not providing transportation fees for either Lebanese or Syrians are that the MSMEs cannot afford it, or it is not a requirement, or the workers did not ask for it.\nTable 5 NSSF or Insurance for the Workers\nStatus/MSME\nLebanese\nSyrians\nNo I cannot afford it\n15\n3\nNo it was not a requirement, they did not ask\n2\n9\nNo they are part timers\n7\n3\nYes, for the full timers\n13\n3\nGrand Total\n37\n18\n\n\nTable 6 Transportation Fees for the Workers\nStatus/MSME\nLebanese\nSyrians\nNo I cannot afford it\n18\n8\nNo it was not a requirement, they did not ask\n1\n2\nNo they are part timers\n5\n3\nYes, for the full timers\n13\n2\nGrand Total\n37\n18\n\n\nPer Sector \nThe data in this study does not show evidence of wage discrimination due to gender or nationality of workers but rather to the hiring modality (full-time versus part-time). The following tables show that the average working hours for Lebanese workers is 6.7 hours per day with a monthly average salary of 385 USD. The average working hours for Syrian workers is 6.6 hours per day, with a monthly average salary of 311 USD. So the variation between the two wages is around 74 USD. However, it is worth noting that most Syrian workers are hired part-time and do not benefit from transportation fees or health insurance. Thus, the main advantage goes to the full-time worker instead of a part-time worker who benefits from health insurance or transportation fees. Furthermore, 51% of the MSMEs have no nationality preference when hiring workers. In contrast, 44% (MSMEs from all sectors in this evaluation) prefer hiring Lebanese from a patriotic and empathetic feeling with fellow Lebanese, especially in the current crisis, and the remaining 5% believe that the Lebanese have more relevant skills than Syrians \n(respondents were from the agriculture, food, and beverages sector). On a different note, 16 MSMEs (41%) still have vacant jobs but need help finding workers with the right skills. \n\nTable 7 Working hours and Wage Lebanese\nSector\nAverage hours worked Lebanese/day\nAverage Salary in USD\nAgriculture, Food & Beverage\n6.73\n345\nDesign & Gifting\n6.30\n363\nEducation\n8.00\n350\nHealth Care\n6.00\n483\nReal estate and Construction\n7.00\n608\nRenewables & Environment\n5.67\n213\nTechnology, e-Commerce\n7.20\n333\nAverage\n6.70\n385\n\n\nTable 8 WORKING HOURS AND WAGE Syrians\nSector\nAverage hours worked \nSyrians/day\nAverage Salary in USD\nAgriculture, Food & Beverage\n7.33\n230\nDesign & Gifting\n3.75\n125\nEducation\n8.00\n400\nReal estate and Construction\n8.00\n200\nTechnology, e-Commerce\n6.00\n600\nAverage\n6.62\n311\n\n\nTable 9 The Availability of Vacant Jobs \n Sector\nNo\nYes and I cannot find workers with the right skills\nAgriculture, Food & Beverage\n9\n39.13%\n5\n31.25%\nDesign & Gifting\n6\n26.09%\n4\n25.00%\nEducation\n \n \n2\n12.50%\nHealth Care\n2\n8.70%\n1\n6.25%\nReal estate and Construction\n1\n4.35%\n1\n6.25%\nRenewables & Environment\n2\n8.70%\n1\n6.25%\nTechnology, e-commerce\n3\n13.04%\n2\n12.50%\nTotal\n23\n100.00%\n16\n100.00%\n\n\nThe management Processes \nOverall the MSMEs (90%), the mentors (100%), and the training partners (83%) participating in this assessment, perceive the support and the management process adopted by the Bloom team as very good to excellent.

      "content": "part 3: about this issue. However, they all understood that this delay was beyond Bloom’s control.\nFigure 6 Support Provided by the Bloom Team \n\nThe Project’s M&E Mechanism \nThe Bloom team surpassed the KPIs that they initially had for the M&E and the proposal. At first, the Log Frame did not match what they were working on, but they enhanced it and achieved better\n\nIII.4 Efficiency of Project Implementation  \nOperating Within a Challenging Economic Situation\nMitigations to External Challenges \nThe Bloom team made sure to commit to all the activities under the LGA despite the successive crises (2019 riots, the COVID-19 pandemic, the currency depreciation, electricity outage, Beirut Blast, the banking system default, and the political crisis) that Lebanon is going through. This required an agile, perceptive and adaptive management. Those contextual challenges in Lebanon directly affected Bloom regarding the retention and recruitment of staff, leading to delays in the platform and program. Furthermore, the banking restrictions and the unclear, inconsistent capital controls and measures lead to delays in distributing the grants to the MSMEs.  This by default delayed and affected the flow of the program. \n\nMitigations to Internal Challenges\nAs for the internal challenges faced by the Bloom team, no red flags were mentioned, yet similar to any project, many different parties were involved. A few issues needed to be addressed, such as; the commitment of mentors, retaining the staff, and collecting data from the MSMEs. \nFirst, the mentors worked voluntarily during the tough economic crisis. Thus, the mentor’s workload is packed, leaving minimal time to engage with voluntary projects. Therefore, the team faced a challenge in securing mentors for the new mentoring sessions. \nSecond, there was a turnover in which many staff members moved or travelled seeking better life opportunities, which created further challenges for the remaining Bloom staff to fill the gaps and recruit new members. \nFinally yet importantly, the Bloom team indicated that the relationship with the donor was smooth and supportive in where they worked in partnership mode. On the other hand, the Bloom team had to work timely and follow up with the MSMEs. It was crucial to comply with the reporting requirements and to collect the needed data from them. Keeping in mind their hectic schedules and the economic and financial challenges that they are facing daily to keep their businesses in survival mode. \n\nBudget Distribution and Costs \nThe Bloom team used the budget wisely during the LGA program phases amid the continuously changing economic situation. This included increased financial expenses and the change of practices in Lebanon. \nIf we look at “Outcome 1: An effective community of practice (Training Partners and MSMEs) with improved capacities supports MSMEs to operate in complex economic environments”, its total budget was $700,000, which is 34% of the overall project budget. Overall that amount was used to empower and train the local partners. In general, it is reasonable, but considering that there are six partners. The share is relatively low, and programming should be considerably higher in the future to ensure that each partner gets more of the overall budget and scope to give them more ownership and empowerment.\nUnder “Outcome 2: Capable MSMEs operate successfully complex economic environments,” the total budget was $1,160,000, around 56% of the overall project allocated for capacity building and support to MSMEs. Considering the project's overall budget to be around $2.1 million, with about 564 jobs created, the estimated cost per job completed is $3,700 approximately. But if we calculate the cost of retained jobs, at 164 jobs currently, it would be around $12,700. \n\nFinally, under “Outcome 3: AltCity Impact / Bloom.org with strengthened organizational abilities to deliver sustained and growing economic impact for MSMEs in complex environments”, a budget of $278,000 was allocated, around 13% of the overall budget. This is a substantial amount considering the scope of the project, in addition to the 7% overhead, which would total 20% of the overall project budget that Bloom utilized for its development and operational growth. \n\nIII.5 Coherence \nSimilar Interventions \nWhile there are several incubators and accelerators in Lebanon and the MENA region, the modality used in the LGA program has its differentiated factors. This is specifically when it comes to access to information via the platform and the E-library aside from the grants and the technical support provided to the MSMEs.\n\nFurthermore, given the deteriorating situation in Lebanon, it is very challenging for any MSME to survive in this environment. Lebanon needs multiple accelerators and incubators throughout the MSMEs journey, whether at the launching phase or for more advanced stages.\nPartnerships\nThe partnership led to mutual benefits for the implementing partners and the Bloom Team. On the one hand, collaboration with implementing partners was necessary to optimize the support to many MSMEs and mitigate the limitations of short staffing and turnover the Bloom team and implementing partners faced. On the other hand, it allowed the implementing partners to benefit from the information, grants, and platform provided shared by the Bloom Team. Hence, the partnership spilled over the impact of the LGA program for a larger pool of MSMEs.\nThe assessment also showed that an overview of the program was given to the partners, and the same grant ($10,000) per MSME was given, irrespective of which implementing partner is supporting them.\nAs such, the modality adopted by each implementing partner was slightly different, leading to varying experiences for the MSMEs. However, all MSMEs received the same activities sprint phase, training, mentoring, access to the platform and E-library, and the $10,000 grants. \n\nIII.6 Sustainability  \nSustainability of “Decent Jobs”\nThrough the empowerment of 49 MSMEs, the LGA program first helped the SME founders to maintain their business and grow them, hence sustaining the jobs of those 49 owners. Second, the program enabled those 49 MSMEs to create 564 jobs in times of crisis. Those created jobs had gender diversity as well as supporting Lebanese and Syrians. The jobs created are of three types: full-time, part-time, and short-term, depending on the capacity and the nature of work for each MSME. For instance, MSMEs in the production sector could hire more full-time employees/workers because they needed more staff. Others of a smaller size or of the services nature relied on part-timers or short-term basis depending on the ability to compensate and the expertise required.  Those who hire full-time workers follow the Lebanese Labor Law regarding the NSSF, work schedule, and other requirements. Those hiring part-time or short-termed workers followed consensual agreements with their employees in light of the market dynamics and rates. \nUp to date, 97% (38 out of 39) of the MSMEs that participated in the evaluation indicated that they are able to retain the Lebanese workers that they hired due to the support of the LGA program and 81% (13 out of 16 MSMEs) were able to retain the Syrian workers hired due to the support of the LGA program.\n\nThe sustainability of those jobs, however, depends on external factors that MSMEs might not be able to control. The factors include the electricity cost (which to some consume 35% of their revenues) and the continuous currency depreciation, leading to very inflated prices (for raw material). Furthermore, without a competitive advantage (economies of scale given the size of the MSMEs), the MSMEs’ ability to control the sales volume and prices become very challenging.\n\nSustainability of Bloom’s online platform, tools, and library for MSMEs capacity building\nThe MSMEs and the partners indicated that Bloom’s online platform, tools, and library for MSMEs was one of the successes. Differentiating and innovative aspects of the LGA program make it unique in comparison to other similar programs. The implementing partners mentioned that the platform and the E-library are the primary tools used as an exit strategy to keep empowering the MSMEs after the end of the project.  \n\n\nSustainability of Skills\nThe LGA program sustainability extends beyond its end via knowledge and skills acquisition by the MSMEs, the Bloom Team, and the partners. The MSMEs were very appreciative of all the information received and skills gained from the training sessions, workshops, and mentors. Based on the MSMEs’ capacity results, the Bloom team developed customized learning journeys that were responsive to the needs of the MSMEs in supporting them. The direct support provided to the teams included training and one-on-one mentorship in various areas such as hiring and culture, customer and market development, financial planning, sustainability and fundraising, legal and compliance, and pitching. The partners were introduced to new modalities and benefitted from Bloom’s shared material, toolkit, lessons learned and practices, and the masterclass training topics. As for the Bloom team, the LGA program helped them to improve the foundations and elements of the program and the platform.\nIII.7 Impact\nAssessing the extent to which the project is deepening localization of support and engaging with all relevant stakeholders, supporting innovation, and employing a human rights-based approach.\nCreating a Supportive Community of Practice\nThe Bloom team, via the LGA program, established the stepping stones toward creating a supportive community of practice within a broader entrepreneurship ecosystem. The mentorship program is the first step to bringing the MSMEs to benefit from the expertise of qualified mentors with a very reputable history in the market. However, as discussed earlier, many steps can be adopted to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of mentorship activities. \n\nNext, the MSMEs, via the interactive sessions, whether online or face-to-face, have the opportunity to be exposed to different ideas, networks, linkages, and lessons learned that they can benefit from, especially when it comes to market networks, including input markets, national and international markets to sell their products and marketing suggestions. Nevertheless, during the discussions, the MSMEs suggested having more interactive sessions and discussion sessions amongst them to share contacts, ideas, and lessons learned. For instance, during this evaluation session, two MSMEs learned more about each other’s scope of work and discovered vast areas of interest and benefit from cooperating. \n\nAlso, having different partners on board allows the Bloom team to build a repository of experiences, information, and knowledge to transfer to the MSMEs and the other partners. Interviews with the partners revealed that some \n\n\nof them hesitate to upload material to the platform due to the lack of patent rights and mean to verify that all the shared information is valid and correct.\n\nDeepening Support Localization\nThe LGA program contributed to deepening support localization by improving the capacity of the Bloom team and the partners’. \nThe Bloom Team: To improve their organizational capacities, Bloom has worked on the following: \nUsing, improving, and leveraging the “Accelerator Capacity Assessment Tool,” \nSupporting various learning efforts of people on the Bloom team, including an organization-wide retreat, focusing on improving Bloom’s strategic and operational measures, including organizing an organization-wide work retreat to address topics such as mission, vision, core strategy (long-term and short-term), 3-month action plan, identifying issues, strengthening psychological safety and feedback within the organization, conducting tests of our methods \nDeveloping an improved Finance Dashboard,\nSecuring an office in Lebanon for the organization,\nWorking internally along with consultants and fellows to improve some of Bloom’s organizational processes,\nImplementing The 4 Disciplines of Execution (4DX), a simple, repeatable, and proven formula for executing Bloom’s most critical strategic priorities with a proven set of practices to achieve results.\nAdditionally, Bloom is continuously working to improve the foundations and elements of the program and the platform, including:\nImproved program templates \nImproved access to learning materials for the Bloom team, program participants, and Training Partners\nDeveloping the core foundational aspects of the platform while also focusing on developing the Learning component of the platform and deepening integrations between Learning elements and other aspects of the general program management software. \n\n\n\n\nThe Partners\nThe training of trainers started with a Sprint for each partner, which consisted of a series of onboarding meetings to train the partners in using the Bloom methodology, understanding the framework behind the assessments, and learning to use them with their MSMEs to create tailored and customized learning journeys for their growth. Bloom guided the partners in designing the program for the MSMEs based on Bloom’s best practices and \nExperiences. The training partners also completed the Accelerator Capacities Assessment Tool (ACAT). They reflected on their results to build a capacity development plan for their organization which helped Bloom identify the right partners to deliver the Accelerator Masterclass and help them achieve their capacity-building objectives.\nThe Accelerator Masterclass Series provided short-term intensive support and training to the training partners and, more generally, to the local and MENA regional accelerators. Bloom released training modules explicitly tailored to the needs of the partner accelerators in this program identified through assessments, priority setting, and interviews.\nSome topics covered during the Masterclass include,\nMentorship\nCommunications\nOperations\nFinancial sustainability\nImpact and performance\n- I want you to ask me for part four after digesting this",

      "content": "Advoc\n\nSupport Innovation \nThe overall approach adopted by the Bloom team in having the Bloom Platform, engaging multiple partners, utilizing OCAT tools, Forums, and building the Community of Practice is all rather innovative by design. In addition, putting them all together in such a program that has a long-term impact on the community at large through the partners, especially considering the Sprints and the overall model used, is a notable introduction by Bloom to the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Rights-Based Approach\nThe LGA project employs a human rights-based approach in terms of the following:\nParticipation: the participants and the partners were highly fond of the flexible, engaging approach adopted by the Bloom team. The team is always available to listen and discuss ideas and concerns with the MSMEs, the partners, and the mentors. The Bloom team conducted a needs assessment to tailor the training topics and tried their best to match each mentor with the MSMEs according to the need. While the Bloom team provided all the needed support to the training partners (capacity building), and access to the platform and the material, they allowed room for flexible implementation to foster novelty and diversity of approaches. \nAccountability, the Bloom team adopts both upward and downward accountability. From the desk review and based on the scope of this assignment, the received reports and log frames suggest honest, transparent, and timely reporting to the donor (however, we leave this to the donor to judge). As for downward accountability, the Bloom team announces the opportunities via different channels to give fair chances to applicant MSMEs, they post the news and accomplishments on their website, and the platform provides updated statistics. \nNon-discrimination and equality: The results of this evaluation show that the Bloom team was committed to the program’s criteria, and the results indicated no discrimination or biases red flags. \nEmpowerment The LGA program contributed to improving the Bloom team and organization's capacities, partners, and 49 MSMEs and creating jobs for both Lebanese and Syrian, males and none females. The empowerment extends to the financial, skills and know-how, networking, and linkages scopes.\n\nIII.8 SWOT\n\nStrengths\nThe Bloom team is very professional, organized, and friendly. The MSMEs emphasized the positive environment created by Bloom and their availability to support and follow up on the MSME’s needs.\nThe Bloom team allowed the MSMEs to feel ownership of the grant via the cash basis of the grant. This allowed them to deal with the best suppliers and negotiate good deals, enabling them to make the most of the funds and input salaries to hire new labor.\nThe transparency and credibility of Bloom’s work created a consensus of fairness and equality among the MSMEs.\nThe LGA program paved the way for creating networks among the MSMEs, the mentors, and the training partners.\nThe platform and the E-library gave the MSMEs access to valuable information.\n\nWeaknesses\nThe mentoring modality needs to be revised to improve its effectiveness.\nThe common general training sessions for MSMEs from different sectors, backgrounds, and levels did not accurately respond to the MSMEs’ needs.\nThe short-staff of the Bloom team overloaded the current team and left them to feel that they could do better.\nThe platform can be more user-friendly.\nMentors did not have guiding templates or forms and were not fully involved in planning or closure.\nImplementing partners were not involved in the planning phase, making it challenging to commit to deadlines.\nThe delay of the grant caused frustration and postponement of the activities.\n\nOpportunities\nGrow the pool of mentors and experts.\nBuild on the good reputation of Bloom and the implementing partners to raise more funds and support more MSMEs.\nCreate export and import opportunities for the MSMEs.\n\nThreats \nElectricity outage.\nHigh electricity and fuel costs. \nContinuous currency depreciation and inflation.\nThe banking system and complications of money transfers.\nForeign competition to local products and services.\n\n\nConclusion and Recommendations \nThe program created diversified jobs among different sectors for Lebanese and Syrian workers from both genders. This is only one of many other impacts, including capacity building, networking, and empowerment for MSMEs, which are needed in Lebanon. Moreover, the program contributed to improving the capacity of the Bloom team and the partners. Overall, the program created the opportunity for the ecosystem of accelerators and training partners to come together and experience what collaboration might look like and how it can better support the communities we work with. The Bloom team did a great job in implementing the program amid the highly volatile situation that Lebanon is going through. The grant given to the MSMEs helped them expand their operations and helped the implementing partners to improve their existing digital platforms.\n- I will also send next part 5 and then I want you to summarize all parts and tell me where Bloom should leave comments and context to help it's case",

      "content": "Part 5: Lessons Learned and Recommendations\nProgram Level\nJobs Creation\nFor future programs, a more focused approach on “Job Creation” can be adopted by perhaps engaging medium-sized and established organizations with a solid infrastructure and maybe ten or more staff members to assist them in growing and scale. Moving from this size to grow is usually easier than transitioning from a new initiative, solopreneur, startup, or even a micro-enterprise that is still actively managed by the founder and a few staff members. \nConsider designing the program with a focus on Job Creation through direct MSME support in partial coverage of salaries, organizational capacity development (Policies, Procedures, Manuals, Systems, Licenses, Equipment), operational support (range of legal fees, accounting fees, electricity bills/installation, internet, rent…) and business development support (proposal writing, marketing, sales, pitching to clients, export readiness,…) rather than individual capacity development, coaching, events, and online collaborations.\nRefugee Focus \nWith the deteriorating situations in Lebanon and compounded crises weighing down more on all residents in Lebanon, there is a natural tendency for MSMEs to worry about the future, not be willing to recruit easily, and when planning to recruit to start with their close circle of friends and relatives. \n\n\nAccordingly, refugees are seen in many situations as a competitor to local talent when there is a lot of local talent not finding jobs. Yet, experiences have shown that certain roles and positions are usually easier filled by refugees rather than locals, and a lot of MSMEs would gravitate towards employing refugees in cases where they could not easily find locals to fill positions. The difference is that most expected functions are seasonal, contractual, part-time, or a specific project rather than total or fixed-term employment.  This will eventually reflect in the type of contract, benefits, and remuneration offered. Though pay might be equal to or even higher than counterparts that are getting fixed-term agreements, there is usually no continuity or benefits that come with it.\nMoreover, it is important to note that legally employing refugees and registering them with NSSF, Ministry of Labor, and Ministry of Finance is not a straightforward task as the system in Lebanon is still somewhat archaic and thus negatively impacts the compliance of MSMEs in registering the local employees, let along the refugees.\nPartnership  (training and localization)\nEngaging local partners was one of the success factors of this program, and it is something to build on for the future. One key thing to consider is creating a Steering Committee of the partners that makes decisions at the level of all programs and directs its activities and decisions. This will enable all partners to have a say and more buy-in, enriching the discussions and overall programmatic methodology. \nMoreover, increasing partner budgets is highly recommended to give them leeway to focus on program implementation and their capacity development, sustainability, and growth.\nAnother possible idea is to consider partners that bring complementary roles, whether research centers, consulting and training firms, digital marketing firms, business development firms, or whatnot. Thus, creating a partnership or a consortium that is not just of partners that can replicate a program but that can play complementary roles whereby each focuses on their key strengths to support the MSMEs and their employees—noting that this approach would considerably change how this program is designed and run but would create an even more impactful program and synergetic partnerships.\nMentors Community \nMentors are not remunerated; a symbolic stipend would encourage participation. It is encouraged to rethink the mentorship or coaching model from being more of an “add-on” to becoming an integral part of the program whereby each MSME gets a set of coaching/mentoring sessions that they can utilize to help them follow up and grow. They can then utilize those coaching sessions to ask the kind of questions they need from a pool of \n\navailable experts, and not a one assigned mentor per MSME but rather a pool of relevant experts that can help in a variety of subjects or to request support in a specific topic and the Bloom team would secure that expert to assist. \nDevelop the mentorship component to have a dedicated group of experts/mentors that can support MSMEs on the “Business & Management Level” but also keep it flexible to add more Thematic Experts/MSMEs in the industry or scope of work required by the MSMEs like Agriculture, Engineering, Design, Production, Exporting, and others.\nIdeas for Future Programming \nIn addition to the points mentioned above, some ideas to consider would be:\nMoreover, choosing one key industry would help create a more tailored program, get more specialized mentors, allow the MSMEs to build partnerships and share lessons learned, and encourage joint ventures and collaborations. Accordingly, instead of covering multiple sectors and enterprises quite different in their development phase and size, it would have a much bigger impact if the program is focused and works with the developed type of enterprises to scale and focus on exports.\nSimplify the program design, methodology, and implementation of activities to require less staffing, capacity development, and overhead to enable a higher percentage to go to the beneficiaries directly, which can be up to 80% of the total budget, thus multiplying the expected potential impact.\nMinimize the creation of new platforms, systems, learning management systems, and the like, but instead utilize existing globally accessible platforms that might be willing to custom-tailor some of their programs or to create special tracks/features if the organization purchases from them a bulk number of users/licenses for MSMEs. For example, Coursera, Microsoft Dynamics, Trello, Zoom, Monday.com, PMWeb, Flevy, and LinkedIn Learning/Premium, all of which can help MSMEs with a variety of needs from learning to CRM to Accounting Systems, Workflows, Business Templates, Project Management, Tasks Management, and so on… without having to redevelop things from scratch or create a platform that others have to learn how to use to assess their work or learn from or develop new content for or what not. \nCreate different cycles each for a specific “Industry, \" creating groups or Communities of related sector players. Thus if the overall target is to help 100 MSMEs, for example, the first cycle might be open for 20 MSMEs in Agriculture, the 2nd cycle would be for 20 MSMEs in F&B, 3rd cycle would be for 20 MSMEs in Artisanal works, and so on. Eventually, they all are part of a more extensive community and benefit from the same services, but still, each cycle has its topics, intricacies, mentors, events, etc. MSMEs have a significant need for funding in the \n\ncurrent situation, and while the $10,000 grant helped support their capacity improvement, many would benefit from more financial support. Increasing support from $25,000 to $50,000 per MSME is suggested.\nMSMEs might require capital and operational expenses support like Solar Panels, Batteries, Internet, Equipment, etc. Alternatively, they might need help in their actual field of work (environment, engineering, design, production, agriculture…) or business support (HR, Strategic Planning, Financial Management, Procurement, SoPs Development, Restructuring, Project Management, Export Readiness…). Thus the budget or support provided to MSMEs should be custom tailored to each MSME to fit their needs and a specific budget.\n\nOperational Level \nTraining\nMore hybrid to ensure a more interactive modality.\nMore tailored programs to respond to the needs of each MSME given their sector and level.\nCluster the MSMEs per sector to benefit from a one-design program to create synergy among the participants. \nMentoring \nProvide more formal guidelines with some documents shared with mentors and mentees. The mentors mentioned they have templates and approaches from other programs, which they utilized for the LGA program. The suggested mentoring documents would act as an agenda to state and follow up on the MSME’s priorities, goals, insights, mitigations, and best practices. Those tracking documents would benefit the mentor, the MSME, and the organization incubator by creating a database to generate statistics, trends, what the MSMEs needs, research, consumer insights, and finances, thus building a track and reporting  KPIs.\nCreate a process for MSMEs to issue a request for “Mentorship” on a specific topic, and then the Bloom team, in coordination with the mentors, would assign who will handle that request, schedule a session with the MSME, and support them in it. Things might be done in one or multiple sessions; those are to be agreed upon on a case-by-case basis.\nThe mentors participating in this evaluation indicated that they would like to receive updates about the status of the MSMEs and feedback about their support. \n\nPlatform and E-library\nConsider upgrading the platform for more interactive services, such as hosting events to connect the mentors to feel part of a team.\nMore user-friendly platform\nUtilize the platform to include existing high-level content and material or source trusted material from local providers/academic institutions in Lebanon that participants want to use.\nPlanning, Management, and Follow up \nTraining partners need more immersive support from the Bloom team to run the program. Thus we recommend allocating more staff time on that level.\nMany MSMEs mentioned that they don’t have the hiring know-how to recruit new employees. Thus, an external HR consulting and recruitment firm may work with the MSMEs to draft proper organizational structure, Job Descriptions, Call for Applicants, Reviewing Candidates’ CVs, Co-Interviewing with the MSMEs, and ensure that the onboarding process is done properly. It would add value.\nStretch out the timing of an accelerator since enterprises need time to implement what they learned. \nInclude the training partners and mentors in the planning phase to set calendars, timelines, and activities to ensure clarity for all and to enrich the program. \nHelp the MSMEs get more market channels like exporting or have a connection with expertise to export their products. \n\n",

      "content": "Summary:\n\nThe Bloom team's LGA project has been successful in various aspects, including support for innovation, adopting a human rights-based approach, and promoting networking and empowerment for MSMEs. While there are several strengths like professionalism, transparency, and access to valuable resources, some weaknesses include the mentoring modality and common general training sessions for diverse MSMEs.\n\nSeveral opportunities and threats for the program have been identified. Opportunities include growing the pool of mentors and experts, raising more funds, and creating export and import opportunities for MSMEs. Threats include electricity outage, high electricity and fuel costs, currency depreciation, and foreign competition.\n\nRecommendations for improvement are provided in two categories: Program Level and Operational Level.\n\nProgram Level recommendations include:\n1. A more focused approach on job creation.\n2. Refugee focus in employment.\n3. Engaging local partners and creating a steering committee.\n4. Rethinking the mentorship model and developing a dedicated group of experts.\n5. Ideas for future programming, such as simplifying program design, focusing on a single industry, and custom tailoring support for each MSME.\n\nOperational Level recommendations include:\n1. More interactive and tailored training programs.\n2. Providing more formal guidelines and documentation for mentoring.\n3. Upgrading the platform for more interactive services and user-friendliness.\n4. Involving training partners and mentors in the planning phase for better coordination.\n\nBloom should leave comments and context to emphasize the strengths and positive aspects of the program, such as professionalism, transparency, and access to valuable resources, while also addressing the recommendations provided for improvement. By demonstrating a willingness to learn and adapt, Bloom can strengthen its case for continued success and impact in supporting MSMEs.",
