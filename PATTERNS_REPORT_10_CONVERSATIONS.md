**Core Insight**: Bilal doesn't choose between engineer, educator, Muslim, philosopher. He **integrates** all domains into a coherent practice where:
- Technology serves spiritual practice
- Education bridges technical and human domains
- Philosophy informs technical choices
- Faith grounds everything

This is not "work-life balance" - it's **work-life synthesis**.
