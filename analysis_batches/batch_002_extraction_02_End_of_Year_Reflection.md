## Life Wheel Snapshot (December 2024)

### **1. Spirituality: 5/10**
**What's Working**:
- Committed to catching up on prayers
- Recent time with shaykh felt meaningful
- Sohba (Sufi gathering) in Spain was deeply connecting

**Challenges**:
- "I don't really feel... I'm making progress"
- "Feeling connected... happens infrequently and rarely"
- "Everything moves so fast that I feel like I can't really sense into it"
- Catching up on prayers = doing rather than feeling connected

**Key Quote**:
> "I just came back with time with my shaykh. That felt really good. Just everything moves so fast that I feel like I can't really sense into it."

**Attention Policy**: SLOWING DOWN - needs space to "sense into" spiritual practice, not just do it

---

### **2. Health: 6/10**
**Physical**:
- "Relatively healthy"
- Some aches and pains
- Movement/play could ease pain

**Mental**:
- ADD/ADHD - uses Adderall
- "Bad brain days whenever I'm not taking any of my Adderall"
- Lost access to Adderall, considering detox
- "Even after like a month of nothing, I'm really not generally in a good place"

**Key Quote**:
> "I'm wondering if I should just try like complete detoxing from caffeine and Adderall and everything to see how my brain is."

**Tension**: Medication dependency vs desire for authentic baseline

---

### **3. Finances: 4/10** (LOWEST RATING)
**Current State**:
- 6 months runway (has money to cover next 6 months)
- After that: "I'll just run out of money"
- No savings account
- Job applications in progress (but "I don't really like the idea of having a job")

**Opportunity Identified**:
> "Maybe should just use while I have money right now and spend it on something that will be a sustainable investment... I could just put 10k into something maybe can help me think about what to put 10k into that will be able to get me $500 a month more thousand maybe."

**Tension**: Need for income vs resistance to traditional employment
**Value**: Wants sustainable, values-aligned income, not "just a job"

---

### **4. Relationships: 5/10**
**Partner**:
- "Relationship with my partner is getting better overall"
- "Sometimes I feel frustrated, but it's okay"

**Geographic Isolation**:
- **Lives in France** (confirmed!)
- "I don't really like living in France"
- "I don't have many friends"
- "My family is far away"
- "I feel like I'm letting them down"

**Community**:
- Muslim community (internationally and in Spain)
- "I see them so infrequently"
- Getting better at connecting but needs more 1:1 relationships

**People to Visit**:
- **Nihal**: "Probably should go visit Nihal"
- **Taib** (T-O-I-B) in UK: "I want to visit Taib in the UK"

**Key Quote**:
> "Maybe I need to invest more one-on-one relationships."

**Attention Policy**: DEEP 1:1 CONNECTIONS over broad networks

---

### **5. Creativity: 7/10** (HIGHEST RATING)
**What Makes Him Come Alive**:
- Screen printing
- Poetry (Joe Edelman says he's "good with poetry")
- Working on "Joe's book"
- Foraging
- Mushroom cultivation

**Key Quote**:
> "It makes me feel excited actually when I get creative. I just see it coming out of me and I'm really happy."

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**:
> "As ChatGPT accelerates that amount of creative output, I feel like I really should make stuff that's handmade and just put it just direct from my hand, unedited, onto paper, onto screen, and then out into the world."

**Tension**: AI automation → drives desire for **UNFILTERED, HANDMADE, DIRECT** creation
**This is a VALUES STATEMENT**: Resistance to AI-mediated creativity

---

### **6. Work & Purpose: 6/10**
**Recent Work**:
- **Iraq consultancy with ITC** (International Trade Centre - UN division)
- Paid well
- "A little stressful and traveled a lot"
- "I was happy to do it"

**Challenge**:
> "In terms of contribution and meaning, I still feel like it was kind of abstract and I don't really feel like it's meaningful and contributing somehow."

**Need**:
> "Maybe I need more validation and feedback. I think that would be really helpful."

**Attention Policy**: Needs to SEE/FEEL the impact of his work, not just be told it's valuable

- Bedroom: "could do some work"
- Bathroom: "I could get a new toilet"
- Office: "just kind of random and I don't really have a good setup for mood creative studios"
