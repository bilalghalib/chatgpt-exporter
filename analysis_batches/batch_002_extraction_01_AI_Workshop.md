## Values & Priorities (SAREC Framework)

### **Value #1: Accessibility in Education**

**Score**: 0.85
**Reasoning**: Multiple explicit references to making workshop accessible across different dimensions (financial, technical, geographic)

**Evidence**:
- "We offer scholarships and discounts for smaller nonprofits" (financial accessibility)
- "No prior tech experience necessary!" (technical accessibility)
- "$100 to $350, ensuring accessibility for nonprofit professionals" (sliding scale pricing)
- Zoom-based (geographic accessibility - remote participation)

**Confidence**: 0.90

**First Observed**: 2023-06-28
**Category**: Core Value

---

### **Value #2: Community-Based Learning**

**Score**: 0.80
**Reasoning**: Emphasis on community of practice, ongoing support, collaborative learning

**Evidence**:
- "open community of practice for continuous learning and improvement"
- "four weeks of dedicated office hours for participants to problem solve, co-work on their prompts"
- "breakout groups" in Day 1
- "collaborative community of practice" as key takeaway

**Confidence**: 0.85

**First Observed**: 2023-06-28
**Category**: Educational Philosophy

### **Value #3: Practical Over Theoretical**

**Score**: 0.75
**Reasoning**: Focus on real-world application, problem-solving, tangible outcomes

**Evidence**:
- "AI prompts that halved Bloom's proposal time" (practical impact story)

## Attention Policies (What Bilal Pays Attention To)

### **CLARITY & CONCISENESS**
**Evidence**: "that's kinda long..." (response to acronym AIENSE)
**Pattern**: Values brevity and simplicity in communication

### **AUDIENCE FIT**
**Evidence**: "which workshop do you think people from tedx or changemakersexchange or social enterprises around the world be interested in?"
**Pattern**: Deeply considers audience perspective and interests

### **ACCESSIBILITY**
**Evidence**: Multiple mentions of scholarships, "no prior tech experience", price range
**Pattern**: Consistently thinks about barriers to entry and how to lower them

### **NAMING/FRAMING**
**Evidence**: Iterates through 15+ workshop name options, settles on "AI Boost: Empowering Social Impact"
**Pattern**: Cares about how things are framed and named

---

## CAPs (Constitutive Actions) vs IAPs (Instrumental Actions)

### **Likely IAP: Landing Page Creation**
**Evidence**: Tactical task, not deep engagement. Quick iteration cycle.
**Reasoning**: Creating landing page is necessary to market workshop, but doesn't appear to be intrinsically meaningful work. The conversation is efficient and task-focused, not exploratory.

**Contrast with Patterns Report**: The Pattern Report showed Bilal doing 27-hour marathon sessions on prayer visualization (CAP). This 1-hour landing page conversation is much more transactional.

### **Possible CAP: Workshop Design**
**Evidence**: Though not visible in THIS conversation, the workshop design itself (mentioned in landing page) shows deep thought about learning experience
**Reasoning**: The comprehensive curriculum (breakout groups, case studies, community of practice, office hours) suggests significant care in the design phase

## People Mentioned

### **Jad**
**Role**: Appears to be collaborator or co-facilitator
**Context**: "Hey Jad, the workshop is due for 14/15/16"
**Interpretation**: Working relationship, likely Bloom colleague
