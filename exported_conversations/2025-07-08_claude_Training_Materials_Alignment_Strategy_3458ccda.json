  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is developing a solar energy training program in Iraq and needed help aligning their course slides with an Excel workbook used for hands-on learning. They have training slides that reference 17+ tabs but their current workbook (Iraqi_Solar_CUSTOMER_READY_Tool.xlsx) only contains 7 tabs focused on Ahmed's coffee shop case study. The user wanted to create a streamlined solution that would work both as a training tool and as a professional customer assessment tool that graduates could use in their solar businesses.\n\nClaude helped the user evolve from an initial complex approach with many separate tabs to an elegant 8-tab structure featuring a Project_Dashboard with a dropdown selector that dynamically rebrands the entire workbook for different use cases. The final design incorporates a Mahalla house case study (10A generator, 150k IQD monthly grid costs, 340m² house with 150m² roof space) alongside the existing Ahmed café example. Key technical calculations were refined to account for Iraq's harsh 49°C climate conditions, including temperature derating factors, dust losses, and conservative sizing using worst-month peak sun hours data.\n\nThe user demonstrated strong technical knowledge of solar system design, questioning calculation methodologies and pushing for more realistic financial projections. They identified critical issues in their existing workbook, including incorrect load analysis formulas, unrealistic payback periods, and missing temperature adjustments. Claude provided detailed implementation guidance covering series/parallel panel configurations, inverter threshold detection for cost optimization, and \"wiggle room\" analysis that shows customers how removing certain loads can significantly reduce system costs. The conversation concluded with a comprehensive implementation plan including named ranges, formulas, and slide alignment strategies for the 5-day training program.",

We’re doing a sticky-note mingle.”\nStep 1: Write (30 s)\u000b “I’m going to pass out one coloured sticky-note and a pen to each of you. On your sticky, write one single word that best answers ‘Why I joined this solar training.’\nIt could be ‘energy’, ‘income’, ‘safety’, ‘future’, anything!\nKeep it short—just one word.”\n(Trainer walks around handing out sticky-notes and pens.)\n“Ready? Go—30 seconds!”\n(After ~30 s, trainer raises hand.)\u000b “Time!”\nStep 2: Mingle & Introduce (1 min 30 s)\u000b “Now, stand up, and find someone you don’t know. Swap sticky-notes: read their word and introduce your partner to your table in a quick 10-second popcorn burst.”\nPopcorn rule: when you’re ready, just call out someone’s name and toss them the “popcorn” to speak.\nExample pop: “Pop! John, tell us your word and why.”\n“Go! Mingle for 90 seconds.”\n(Trainer circulates, encourages quick popcorn calls at tables: “Pop! Aisha?” “Pop! Mahmoud?”)\nStep 3: Share & Sit (30 s)\u000b (After ~1 min 30 s, trainer claps hands.)\u000b “Awesome—have a seat! Let’s do quick popcorn on one word per table.”\nTrainer points to Table 1: “Pop!

The first two are Learn: by mid-morning you’ll be able to identify every PV component on the table and interpret Voc, Isc, and temperature coefficients from a datasheet.\nThen in Apply, you’ll calculate a real family’s load in amps and kilowatt-hours—and practice our zero-injury lock-out pledge on actual panels.\nFinally, in Sell, you’ll use those numbers to compare generator vs solar ROI and record a quick 1-minute pitch.\nFeel free to refer back to these as we go—each objective aligns to our Learn-Apply-Sell rhythm.”\n\nSafety = Professional Standards = Safety\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n0 callbacks (Share Ali’s story) \n⚠️ Cost of one accident: 5M IQD contract + reputation \n⚠️ Isolate circuit — lock-out tag & padlock\n⚠️ Verify zero volts (DC first) with multimeter\n⚠️ Wear gloves & safety glasses\n⚠️ When work in electricity combine another person with you.\n⚠️ Use isolated tools while working in electricity.\n⚠️ One person calls out \"CLEAR!\" before reconnecting\n⚠️ Never touch a live DC string\nFacilitator notes:\nOpening Hook (30 s):\n“Before we jump in, I want to remind everyone why safety is non-negotiable. Last month, our colleague Ali got an accident with electricity because [the detailed story to be confirmed].”\n[Show a brief photo if available]\nLesson from Ali’s Story (45 s):\n“Ali admitted later that he needs to pay attention to [the detailed mistake to be confirmed].”\n“We don’t want ‘it always works’—we want zero incidents.”\nStep-by-Step Safety Ritual (1 min):\nIsolate: “First, open the breaker and hang the lock-out tag and padlock. That tag must read your name and time.”\nTest for Zero Volts: “Always grab your multimeter, set it to DC volts, and verify zero at both panel junction and inverter input.”\nPPE On: “Gloves and safety glasses stay on from start to finish—no exceptions.”\nBuddy System: “Never work alone. Your partner watches your back, hands you tools, and calls out if they see anything unsafe.”\nInsulated Tools: “Only use insulated screwdrivers, pliers, and cutters. Ordinary tools can turn into conductors.”\n“CLEAR!” Confirmation: “Before reconnecting, one person must shout ‘CLEAR!’ and everyone else must acknowledge. Only then do you switch the breaker back on.”\nHands Off Live DC: “Under no circumstances touch a live DC conductor. If you find voltage present, repeat steps 1–3.”\u000b\nReinforce & Model (45 s):\n“Let’s demo right now. Volunteer with me: please come lock out this breaker.”\n[Walk through the lock-out/tag-out procedure slowly, narrating each step: writing tag, locking padlock, testing multimeter, buddy confirmation, shout ‘CLEAR!’]\n“See how deliberate we are?

And they fill our air with smoke we all breathe.”\nQuick check-in: “By show of hands, who here has heard their generator run for more than 12 hours in one day?” (Pause for a few raised hands.)\nNational Grid (20 s)\n“The grid is cheaper—100 to 160 IQD/kWh—but only delivers power 8–12 hours a day, and the voltage wobbles so lights flicker and devices burn out. Not exactly reliable.”\nSunshine Potential (20 s)\n“Contrast that with 3 000 hours of sun every year in Mosul—more than 8 hours of sun daily on average. The sun is free, constant, and our best untapped resource.”\nSolar Cost Comparison (20 s)\nSolar Adoption (≈ 25 s)\nPoint to “< 5%”\n“Today solar makes up less than 5 percent of our energy mix.”\n“Yet with 3 000 sun-hours per year, the sun is our most reliable and pollution-free source.”\n“Yet each year, more people in Mosul are installing solar panels—adoption is rising fast”\n“And when you calculate all costs—hardware, installation, and maintenance—solar can already compete with grid rates, especially if you factor in the value of clean air.”\nTransition to Next Slide (15 s)\n“Now that we see why solar makes sense here, let’s look at the three main ways to set up a system—off-grid, on-grid, and hybrid.”\nClick to reveal “Three Solar Set-ups” slide.\n\nAhmed's Coffee Shop Case Study\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\"Ahmed's coffee shop has:\n- 1 Italian espresso machine: 1,800W\n- 1 Refrigerator: 200W  \n- 6 LED lights: 300W total\n- 2 Fans: 200W\n\nWith solar Monthly savings: 324,000 IQD\nPayback period: 9.9 months\nAfter 5 years: 19.4 million IQD saved\"\nACTIVITY: Ahmed's Coffee Shop Case Study\nTIME: 09:25-09:50\n==================================================\n\nPURPOSE:\nProve solar economics with relatable local example\n\nFACILITATOR SCRIPT:\n\"Meet Ahmed, a coffee shop owner in Baghdad.

See the junction in the middle between the P-type layer (on the right) and the N-type layer (on the left)? That’s where the magic happens.”\u000b\nExplain the photoelectric effect\u000b “When a photon—one packet of light—strikes that PN-junction, it gives an electron enough energy to jump from the P-side into the N-side. That movement of electrons is a direct current (DC) we can harness.”\u000b\nLocal context tie-in\u000b “Because rooftops in Mosul can hit 49 °C, real panels lose up to 14 % of their power compared to lab conditions. So, in the factory they flash each panel for just 1 ms under a xenon lamp to confirm it really meets its rated output before it ever sees our heat.”\u000b\nPop-corn Q1\u000b “Who can point out where the P-layer sits? … Yes, the right side—exactly.”\u000b Follow-up: “Why does knowing that orientation matter when we connect many cells in series for high voltage?”\u000b (Take one quick answer, then affirm.)\u000b\nSegue to the demo\u000b “It might look a lot like an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor)—both respond to light.

In broad daylight it converts sunlight directly into DC electricity. Its job is to capture as much sun as possible.\n[Move pointer to inverter]\nHybrid inverter, 5 kW capacity. It takes that DC electricity from the panels and any battery, then turns it into AC for your home—or sends excess back to the grid. On Day 2 you’ll tear one open and spot the differences between a cheap knock-off and a premium unit.\n[Finally, indicate the battery]\nLi-ion battery, 5 kWh BYD pack. It stores surplus energy so you’ve got power when the sun sets or the grid fails.

Think of these as your solar-survival kit.”\nVoc (Open-circuit voltage):\u000b “This is the maximum voltage your panel can spit out when nothing’s hooked up. It’s critical because your inverter has a voltage ceiling—stay below it or you risk damage.”\nIsc (Short-circuit current):\u000b “This is the peak current if you directly short the panel leads. We never actually do that—except in testing—but it tells us how big of a fuse and cable we need to keep everything safe.”\nTemp-coef (Temperature coefficient):\u000b “Panels lose power as they heat up. A typical value is –0.35 % per °C, so on a 60 °C roof you might be 7 % down just from heat. In Mosul, that adds up fast—always factor it in.”\nAzimuth (East/West offset):\u000b “Azimuth tells us which way the panels face: 0° is true south, –90° is east, +90° is west. Even a 15° error can cost you a few percent of annual energy.”\nTilt (β):\u000b “That’s the angle from horizontal—think of it like tilting your panel to chase the sun. At our latitude we use around 30°, but small tweaks bump up winter versus summer yield.”\nPeak-Sun-Hour:\u000b “This compresses sun intensity into ‘hours of full sun per day.’ If Mosul averages 5 kWh/m²/day, one kWp of panels makes about 5 kWh each day.”\nkWh ↔ Amp conversion:\u000b “To turn a device’s current draw into energy: Amps × Volts × Hours ÷ 1000 = kWh.

Setup reminder (30 s):\n“Okay everyone, please take the printed datasheet at your table—one for the premium Longi panel, one for the low-quality panel. You’ll need pens.”\n\n2. Explain the task (30 s):\n“On each sheet you’ll find a sea of numbers. Our goal in the field is to spot three key specs in under a minute. Today those are:\n  • Voc: the panel’s open-circuit voltage (think of it as the “pressure” it can build when nothing’s attached).\n  • Isc: the short-circuit current (the maximum “flow” if you directly connect the leads).\n  • Temp-coef: how much power changes with temperature (for example, –0.35 % per °C, so panels lose a bit of output when they get hot).”\n\n3. Analogy (30 s):\n“Imagine Voc is like the highest pressure in a water hose when the nozzle is closed. Isc is the flood of water if you remove the nozzle completely. Temp-coef is how much that water flow drops when the hose gets hot in the sun.”\n\n4. Countdown & roam (30 s + 1 min):\n“Ready? I’ll set a timer for 2 minutes—find Voc, Isc, and Temp-coef on both sheets, write them down in the margin. Go!”\n\n5. Wrap-up (30 s):\nAfter timer → “Stop! Great job.

We also watch the inverter’s DC input voltage range and anti-islanding safety.\nWhen panels over-produce, we charge our battery. The BMS ensures each cell stays safe, C-rate limits charge/discharge currents, and 90 % round-trip efficiency tells us how much we actually get back later.\nFinally, the AC from the inverter feeds your loads—from pumps and motors to LED lights. We size this side with kWh/day and peak-amp estimates plus a 20 % safety buffer.\u000b\nOver the next five days, every Learn → Apply → Sell cycle ties back to one or more of these arrows: tuning each component, wiring each link, and telling the end-user “here’s how sunlight turns into dollars saved.” Keep this flow in mind as your north star for Module 1.”\n\nComponent Stations — Setup\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nComponent Stations - Pre-Setup Checklist\n📋 Trainer Preparation\nStation 1: Panel Comparison\nEquipment Needed:\n1 premium solar panel\n1 low-quality solar panel\nStation folder with:\n✅ Panel datasheets (premium vs cheap) - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Comparison checklist (EN + AR) - printed\nStation 2: Inverter Teardown\nEquipment Needed:\n1 genuine inverter\n1 refurbished inverter\nStation folder with:\n✅ Inverter datasheets (both units) - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Teardown checklist - printed\n✅ Safety glasses for each participant\nStation 3: Battery Health Check\nEquipment Needed:\nReal battery sample\nFake/refurbished battery sample\n1 clamp meter\nStation folder with:\n✅ Battery specification sheets - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Health check procedure (AR/EN) - printed\nStation 4: MC4 Crimp & Test\nEquipment Needed:\nMC4 crimp tools\nMC4 connector pairs\n1 multimeter (polarity test)\nSafety gloves\nStation folder with:\n✅ MC4 connector specifications - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Crimp procedure checklist - printed\n✅ Polarity test instructions - printed\n⚠️ Trainer Note: Each station must have complete printed materials before participants arrive.

Solar panels work best when sunlight hits them directly. Optimal tilt depends on location and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is 32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best orientation.\nFacilitator notes:\u000b “Okay, team—let’s talk about tilt and azimuth.\n‘Tilt’ is just how much you tip your panel up from flat ground. If it’s too flat, you miss low-angle winter sun; too steep, you lose high summer sun. In Mosul we aim for 32 to 36 degrees—that balance gives us the most energy year-round.\n‘Azimuth’ means the compass direction the panel faces. 0 degrees is true south, which gets the highest sun all day. A few degrees east or west are okay, but aim as close to south as you can.\n\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other structures can block sunlight from reaching solar panels. Even partial shading significantly reduces power output, as the entire string performance drops to that of the shaded panel. To maximize energy production year-round, it's important to avoid shaded spots when installing solar panels.\nFacilitator notes:\u000b “Next up: shading. This is a solar killer.\nAny time a bit of your panel is shaded, the whole string of panels drops in power—like a traffic jam on your roof.\nSee that tree branch on the right? That tiny stripe of shade can cost you 20 to 30 percent of your daily energy.\n\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\nWhat is the peak load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\nWhat is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\nHow many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries without other input sources?)\nIs there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\nWhat is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar installation.\nWhat is the direction of true south?\nWhat are the building’s operating hours?\nHow many days per week is the building operational?\nWhat type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\nAre there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\nAny additional information?\nFacilitator notes: \n\u000b “Here’s your Field Survey Checklist—twelve key questions you always ask on any new rooftop. Today, we’ll practice using it.\nActivity Instructions:\nI need you in your teams to choose one nearby roof—your house, or the building next door.\nTake five minutes to answer the first six questions on the left in jot-form on a sticky note:\nPeak and average amps, future growth, grid availability, system type, and battery autonomy.\nAlso note any shading obstacles you spot—trees, pipes, walls.\u000b\nGo! I’ll set a timer for five minutes. After that, each team quickly shares one surprising thing you found.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nDust Loss in Mosul\n15 % drop after 4 weeks without cleaning\nWeekly wipe → > 95 % performance\nDesign\n* Photo of dusty panel being swept\n*Mini bar-chart contrasting “Clean” vs. “Dusty” panel output\nFacilitator notes (2 mins):\nIntroduction (15 s)\u000b “Let’s talk about what really happens when panels sit unclean on a Mosul rooftop.”\u000b\nDust Impact Story (30 s)\u000b “Local field measurements show that in just four weeks of normal desert dust accumulation, a panel’s energy output drops by about 15 percent. That’s almost one-sixth of your daily yield gone, simply because the sun can’t penetrate the dirt.”\u000b\nBar-Chart Walkthrough (20 s)\u000b “Here on the left, the ‘Clean’ bar represents the full 100 percent rated output. Next to it, the ‘Dusty’ bar falls to roughly 85 percent—a tangible loss that erodes your ROI faster every month.”\u000b\nMaintenance Solution (30 s)\u000b “The good news? A weekly wipe restores the panel back to over 95 percent of its original performance. That’s only a 5 percent drop versus 15 percent if you wait a month.”\u000b\nCustomer Pitch Tease (25 s)\u000b “This data underpins our maintenance-service offer. In our ‘Sell’ block later, you’ll see how to turn a 5 percent performance guarantee into a compelling subscription package for homeowners and businesses. Imagine promising ‘Less than one day of dust loss per week—guaranteed,’ and backing it with hard numbers.”\u000b\nTransition (10 s)\u000b “Next, we’ll move into our Frame & Torque checklist—because after we agree on cleaning frequency, we must ensure the hardware stays tight and secure against Mosul’s winds.”\n\n\nWind-Load & Torque Logic\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nF = q × Cₚ × A\nMosul gusts ≈ 35 m/s ⇒ 1.5 kN/m² pressure\nTorque every M8 bolt to 18 Nm\n*Photo of a torque wrench “clicking” on an M8 bolt, annotated “18 Nm”\nSmall inset: stylized wind arrow striking a rooftop array, labeled “35 m/s”\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s talk about wind loads.\nIn engineering we calculate the force on a panel as F = q × Cₚ × A, where q is dynamic pressure, Cₚ is our shape factor, and A is area.\nHere in Mosul, 35 m/s gusts translate to about 1.5 kN per square meter pressing on your solar array—enough to rip loose under-torqued bolts.\nThat’s why every M8 fastener on our Haykal frame must click precisely at 18 Newton-meters. Under-torque and the next big gust will loosen your rails, risking misalignment and damage.\nHands-on tip: When you hear that “click,” stop turning—over-torque can strip threads. Next up, we’ll quiz you on tilt and azimuth before we head onto rooftop checks.”\n\n\n[CREATE NEW SLIDE AFTER THIS]\nTitle: 30-Day Success Roadmap\nContent:\nYOUR FIRST MONTH PLAN:\n\nWeek 1: Setup ⚡\n□ Register business\n□ Order basic tools\n□ Practice on family\n□ Join alumni network\n\nWeek 2: First Install 🔧\n□ Small system (1-2kW)\n□ Document everything\n□ Get testimonial\n□ Share success\n\nWeek 3: Scale Up 📈\n□ Second installation\n□ First referral\n□ Social media posts\n□ Price confidently\n\nWeek 4: Establish 🏆\n□ Third installation\n□ Create portfolio\n□ Network meeting\n□ Plan month 2\n\n\"Success is a process!\" \n\n\nMounting System – Iraqi Conditions\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n*Photo B: Bent rail due to no expansion gap\n*Photo A: Cracked concrete from poor anchor curing\n*Photo C: Rusted slot-clips in dusty rooftop\nFacilitator notes:\n“Now that we’ve covered wind loads and torque specs, let’s dive into how Iraqi roof conditions affect your mounting system.\nFirst: Thermal Expansion Gaps.\nUnder Mosul’s 50 °C rooftop heat, aluminum rails and panel frames expand by about 3 mm per meter.\nIf you mount modules flush, they’ll buckle as they heat up—short-term stress and long-term fatigue.\nBest practice: leave at least a 5 mm gap between adjacent frames and at end-stops.\u000b\nNext: Chemical Anchor Process. A drilled hole and raw bolt aren’t enough in concrete—dust, heat, and vibration degrade simple expansion anchors. Instead, follow these four steps:\nDrill a 12 mm hole and blow out any dust.\nInject epoxy-based chemical anchor, filling the hole.\nInsert the threaded rod and leave it to cure for 24 hours.\nTighten the nut to 25 Nm—this torque drives resin into every crevice.\u000b\nFinally: Extra Wind-Load Notes.\nApply sealant tape along the rail slots to protect against dust infiltration and corrosion.\nOn the windward edge, use edge clamps or anti-uplift brackets to boost your pull-out resistance by an additional 20 %.\nNow, look at these real-world failure examples:\nPhoto A: anchor cured in dusty hole—notice the crack around the mount where the bond failed.\nPhoto B: panels bowed outwards because no expansion gap let them press against each other under heat.\nPhoto C: rusty slot-clips—dust trapped moisture and ate through the aluminum.\u000b\nActivity prompt (30 s):\u000b “Before we move on, turn to your neighbor and name one step of the chemical anchor process you’ve never done before. Go!”\n[After 30 s pair-share]\n“Great—let’s carry these mounting best practices into Station 1 of our Apply block, where you’ll assemble and torque the rails on a mock roof section with proper gaps and anchors.”\n\nDC Connection Perfection\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nStep 1\nStrip Cable\n(8 mm insulation)\nStep 2\nInsert Pin\n(fully home)\n*Photo A: cleanly stripped PV cable\n*Photo B: pin inserted to shoulder\nStep 3\nCrimp\n(18 Nm torque)\nStep 4\nPull-Test\n(≥ 150 N retention)\n*Photo C: crimper on pin, listen for “click”\n*Photo D: pull-tester reading ≥ 150 N\nFacilitator notes:\n[After reviewing mounting, trainer transitions:]\u000b “Before you head to the MC4 crimp stations, let’s lock down the perfect DC-connection ritual—because a bad crimp is more than a loose wire, it’s a fire hazard. In fact, up to 80 percent of rooftop fires start right here at the connectors.\nStep 1: Strip Cable\nGoal: expose exactly 8 mm of bare conductor. Too little and your pin won’t seat; too much and strands get nicked.\nTip: use the dedicated PV cable stripper’s stop gauge. You should see every strand intact.\u000b\nStep 2: Insert Pin\nGoal: slide the MC4 pin fully onto the exposed conductor until it locks at the shoulder.\nCheck: the gold-plated shoulder should be flush with the insulation’s edge. No copper should peek out.\u000b\nStep 3: Crimp\nGoal: use your ratchet crimper set to 18 Nm.\nListen: the “click” tells you you’ve hit the target torque—stop immediately to avoid over-crimping.\u000b\nStep 4: Pull-Test\nGoal: verify a retention force of at least 150 Newtons (about 15 kgf).\nProcedure: clamp the connector in the pull-tester jaws and steadily pull until you see the reading. Anything under 150 N means re-crimp.\u000b\nMini Activity (1 min):\u000b “Turn to your neighbor and quiz them: ‘What’s the one audible cue you listen for during crimping?’\u000b Go!”\n[30 s pair-share]\n“Exactly—the ratchet click.

The kit is fastest on site; the welded frame can be stronger but costs more in labour.”\u000b\nTorque Spec (30 s)\u000b “Every M8 bolt must be tightened to 18 Nm—just like on your MC4 and rail-mount tasks. Under-torque risks loosening; over-torque can strip threads.”\u000b\nWind-Load Calculation (60 s)\u000b “Mosul’s design wind pressure is 1.5 kN/m², which translates to about 150 kgf per m² of panel area: \nF = Pressure × Area  \nF = 1 500 N/m² × 1 m² ≈ 1 500 N ≈ 150 kgf  \nThat’s why we limit rail spans to 1.5 m—to keep bending loads within safe limits—and why in Tab 3 of your workbook you’ll price extra brackets or gussets so your kit stays solid in a storm.”\u000b\nTransition to Apply (30 s)\u000b “Now let’s head to our framing station, where you’ll practice bolting the kit rails to a mock roof section, torque them to 18 Nm, and sketch where extra brackets go. Grab your torque wrench and Workbook Tab 3—let’s go!”\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nRooftop Hazards & PPE\n🪜 Ladder at 75°: “Set ladder at a 75° angle for stability.”\n\n🪢 Harness & Anchor: “Always wear a fall-arrest harness clipped to a certified anchor.”\n\n🥽🧤 Gloves & Goggles: “Insulated gloves and safety glasses on at all times.”\nFacilitator notes:\n“Okay team, before we climb any more roofs, let’s run through our rooftop safety essentials.”\n1. Ladder Angle (30 s)\u000b “First, the ladder. You see the 75° icon—why 75°? Too shallow and it slips out; too steep and it tips backward. To find 75°, stand with your toes at the ladder base, reach your arms straight out: your palms should just touch a rung. Practice that every time you set up.”\n2. Harness & Anchor (45 s)\u000b “Next, fall protection. Every one of you must wear a harness clipped to a certified anchor point. No exceptions. If you’re more than one step onto the roof, hook in before moving. The anchor must be rated for at least 5 kN—always inspect the hardware before use.”\n3. Insulated Gloves & Safety Glasses (30 s)\u000b “Finally, PPE. Even if you’re just tightening a bolt, insulated gloves protect you from unexpected live wires or sharp edges. Safety glasses shield your eyes from dust, flying debris, or cable snap-backs. Keep them on from the moment you step onto the roof.”\nQuick Check (15 s)\u000b “Popcorn style—shout out one rooftop hazard we haven’t covered yet!”\u000b (Wait for a response, e.g., hot surfaces, sun exposure.)\nTransition (10 s)\u000b “Great—keep these rules top of mind all day. Next up, we’ll move into our wind-load and torque block, where we’ll practice safe bolt-torquing on a mock frame.”\n\nFuse & Ground Rules\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFuse on positive DC as close to battery as possible\nUse DC-rated breakers for combiner if > 4 strings\nGrounding and lightning rod ≥ 2 m, copper-clad 16 mm Ø. Target ≤ 5 Ω earth resistance (demo showed 12 Ω acceptable only for class)\nTest resistance ≤ 5 Ω (goal)\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s cover two non-negotiables in every hybrid PV system: DC fusing and earthing.”\n1) Battery-Positive Fuse (45 s):\u000b “Always install the first fuse on the positive DC cable right at the battery’s terminal. Why? If a short happens anywhere in the wiring, that fuse blows instantly and protects every meter of cable, every combiner box, and your inverter. No fuse here means your cable could catch fire or your battery pack could go into thermal runaway.”\n2) DC-Rated Breakers at Combiners (30 s):\u000b “When you have more than four panel strings feeding a combiner, swap the standard fuse for a DC-rated miniature breaker. DC arcs don’t self-extinguish as fast as AC arcs—so you need a breaker designed for DC interruption. Always check the label: it should say ‘DC’ or ‘PV use.’”\n3) Ground Rod Specs (30 s):\u000b “For your earth electrode, drive at least 2 meters of 16 mm-diameter copper-clad steel into the ground, as shown here. Copper-clad offers corrosion resistance, so your rod stays conductive for years.”\n4) Earth Resistance Target (30 s):\u000b “After driving the rod, measure ground-to-rod resistance. In class we saw 12 Ω, which is fine for a demo. But on a real rooftop or field installation, we aim for ≤ 5 Ω. Why? Lightning and surge currents will always seek the path of least resistance—so you want it going into the earth rod, not through your inverter or structure.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s):\u000b “Now that we understand the why and how, let’s head out and test our demo rod to see that 12 Ω reading in action.”\n\nIraqi Grounding Techniques\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n4-Step Ground Enhancement Process\nPre-Drill & Clean\nDrill hole to 1 m depth, remove loose soil.\nPack Enhancement Compound\nPour in specialized conductive powder (sachet shown).\nBackfill & Hydrate\nRefill with original soil + 2 L of water per 0.5 kg compound.\nMeasure & Verify\nRetest; repeat hydration every 3 months if > 5 Ω.\nGoal: ≤ 5 Ω for safe lightning & fault clearance\nFacilitator notes:\n[After covering fuse & rod specs:]\u000b “In Mosul’s dry, compacted soils, you often see resistivity above 1 000 Ω·m—that’s why a plain copper rod alone can measure 12–15 Ω, not the < 5 Ω we need for reliable fault-clearing.\nStep 1: Pre-Drill & Clean\nWe start by drilling a full 1 m hole. Remove any loose dirt or rock so our compound makes intimate contact with surrounding earth.\u000b\nStep 2: Pack Enhancement Compound\nHere’s our GroundPro™ sachet—a mix of bentonite clay and conductive salts. Pour the entire 0.5 kg pack around the rod.\u000b\nStep 3: Backfill & Hydrate\nRefill the hole with original soil, then pour in 2 L of clean water. The water activates the clay’s swelling and forms a low-resistance zone around the rod.\u000b\nStep 4: Measure & Verify\nAfter waiting 30 minutes for settling, clamp your earth tester and measure. If you’re still above 5 Ω, hydrate again or add a second sachet. We also re-hydrate every 3 – 6 months to maintain performance.\u000b\nMini Q&A (30 s):\u000b “Why do we use both clay and salts instead of just pouring water?”\u000b – Expected answer: “Clay holds moisture; salts improve conductivity.”\n“Exactly—that combo keeps the soil conductive, even in our hottest summers.\nTransition to Demo:\u000b “Next, we’ll drive our demonstration rod, pack a sachet, hydrate, and see how we drop from 12 Ω down to under 5 Ω live. Gloves on—let’s go!”\n\nEarthing Rod Mini-Demo\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nHammer 1 m rod  \nConnect tester – read Ω value on screen\nFacilitator notes:\n“Time for live verification—let’s test our earthing rod.”\n1) Safety First (15 s):\u000b “Before anyone swings, helmet, gloves, and work boots on. Check that no one is standing within the hammer’s arc.”\n2) Hammering the Rod (30 s):\u000b “Trainee, please drive that 1 m rod straight down until only about 10 cm protrudes. Keep it vertical—any tilt reduces contact area with the earth.”\n3) Connecting the Meter (30 s):\u000b “Now, clip one multimeter lead to the top of the rod clamp and the other to our reference stake. Set the meter to the ohms range.”\n4) Reading & Context (30 s):\u000b “We’re seeing 12 Ω. Remember, for a real rooftop you want ≤ 5 Ω—so you’d add water to the soil or drive a second rod nearby to lower the resistance.”\n5) Quick Q&A (15 s):\u000b “Why do you think soil moisture matters? … Exactly: water improves conductivity between the rod and surrounding earth.”\n6) Wrap-up & Transition (15 s):\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen how to measure earth resistance.”\n\nPreview Workbook Tab 4: BOM & Installation\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n📊 SPREADSHEET MOMENT \u000bTab 4: BOM & Installation automatically generates\n10 min Activity Name\u000b Preview: Tab 4 – BOM & Installation\nPurpose\u000b Show how technical specifications drive your cost model and timeline, setting you up to document and price a professional install.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: U-shape seating facing screen with laptops/tablets open to Tab 4\nMaterials needed: Projector displaying Tab 4; each participant’s workbook open on Tab 4; printed “Station Guides” at front table\nPre-activity checks: Ensure everyone is on Tab 4; confirm formulas populate subtotal, margin, and total automatically\n\nFacilitator Script\nOpening Hook (30 s)\u000b “Now we move from theory to real-world quoting: your Tab 4 is where you’ll translate panel specs, mounting details, wiring and labor into a professional proposal.”\u000b\nExplain Slide Sections (2 min)\nBill of Materials table:\u000b “Here you list every category—from panels and mounting rails to ground rods and labor.

Just like yesterday, we’ve organized them into our Learn–Apply–Sell rhythm:\nLEARN — Simulating Solar\n“In this morning’s Learn block, you’ll get hands-on with PVWatts (and PVsyst if it’s available) using the rooftops you photographed. First, we’ll show you how to enter your roof’s tilt, azimuth, and location to generate an annual energy yield and performance ratio. Then we’ll dive into the loss breakdown—so you understand where each kilowatt-hour goes (soiling, thermal losses, mismatch, etc.). By the end, you’ll know exactly how to read those charts and numbers to plan a real installation.”\n\nAPPLY — Laptop & Shade-Scene\n“Next, in Apply, you become your own site-surveyor. You’ll run your rooftop simulation, note the yearly kWh, then switch to the shade-scene tool: draw any trees, chimneys, or water tanks and generate a percentage loss report. This shows in numbers how much shaded hours cost in energy and helps you recommend simple fixes like pruning or panel repositioning.”\n\nSELL — Market, Cash-Flow & Pitch\n“Finally, in Sell, you’ll use our Workbook Tab 5 to build a ten-year cash-flow model—factoring in system cost, O&M, and any supplier financing. Once you see the cumulative savings curve rising, it’s time to craft a short pitch: propose a bundle (e.g. expansion kit plus performance monitoring), highlight trust factors (real warranty, local support), and close with a question: ‘Shall we schedule your upgrade today?’ This wraps up Day 4’s cycle from theory to practice to customer value.”\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) - PVWatts Calculator\n(https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/index.php)\nAssists with:\nIrradiation modeling\nHouse orientation analysis\nSolar energy output estimation\nFacilitator notes:\nPurpose of PVWatts (20 s)\n“PVWatts is a free, web-based tool that lets you estimate a solar array’s annual and monthly energy production in just a few clicks. It handles three key tasks for you:\nIrradiation modeling – it uses NASA satellite data to calculate average sun hours for your location.\nOrientation analysis – you can adjust tilt and azimuth and instantly see how those choices affect yield.\nOutput estimation – it converts panel wattage into expected kWh/day and kWh/year.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nFacilitator notes:\nIntro & Context (15 s): “On this slide you see screen captures from the NREL PVWatts Calculator. We’ll be using PVWatts today to quickly simulate system output before moving into more complex tools.”\nWalk-through the Interface (30 s): “Let’s look at the main sections:\nLocation input: enter Mosul, Iraq here to load local climate data.\nSystem info: set your DC system size (e.g. 3 kW), module type, and array type.\nAdjustments: panel tilt, azimuth, system losses (dirt, wiring).\nResults: scroll down to see the monthly production graph and annual kWh.”\nWhy PVWatts for Day 4 (20 s): “We choose PVWatts because it’s fast, reliable, and gives you a consistent baseline. Today you’ll:\nRun simulations for different panel tilts and sizes.\nCompare your clean-sheet estimates with the real-world data you collected yesterday.\nLearn how small changes—like rotating your array 10° east—can gain or lose hundreds of kWh per year.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s): “Next up, I’ll demo a live PVWatts run: we’ll input our Mosul coordinates, set a 4 kW array with a 30° tilt, and review the output curve. Then, you’ll pair up and simulate your own scenarios.”\nTrainer Tips\n“Encourage participants to note the “Effective Sun Hours” value—it’s the core driver of kWh.\nRemind them that PVWatts assumes “clean” modules; compare against yesterday’s dust-loss data in your lab.\nIf someone’s connection is slow, show them the desktop screenshot you projected.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSystem Sizing & Design Assumptions\nDay 4\nAssumption\nValue\nBaseline system size\n1 kW ⇒ ~1 200 kWh / yr\nPanel tilt\n32–36 °\nAzimuth\n0 ° (true south)\nTemp coefficient\n–0.35 % / °C (≈10 % loss @ 50 °C)\nPerformance ratio target\n≥ 75 %\nIrradiation\n~ 5 kWh / m² / day\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s pause and lock in our ‘standard recipe’ before we design any system.”\nBaseline energy yield (10 s):\n“We assume 1 kW of panels will deliver roughly 1 200 kWh per year in Mosul. That’s our rule of thumb for initial sizing.”\u000b\nOptimal tilt & azimuth (15 s):\n“Tilting panels between 32 and 36 degrees and facing them due south (0 ° azimuth) captures the most sun over the year. Small deviations cost you a few percent of output.”\u000b\nTemperature coefficient (20 s):\n“Every degree above STC reduces power by 0.35 %. At 50 °C on a hot roof, you lose about 10 % of nameplate capacity—so pick panels with a good temp-coef or size up accordingly.”\u000b\nPerformance ratio target (15 s):\n“Our Performance Ratio (PR)—the real-world efficiency after losses—should be 75 % or higher. This accounts for wiring, inverter conversion, soiling, and temperature.”\u000b\nIrradiation (10 s):\n“Mosul averages around 5 kWh/m² per day of sun. Multiply that by your array’s kWp and PR to forecast daily kWh.”\n“With these numbers, you can jump into PVWatts, run your first ‘clean-sheet’ simulation, and then compare to our real-world data from Day 3’s roof-rig. Ready? Let’s go!”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nShade Analysis & Optimization – Quantify Losses\nDay 4\n*Photo A: morning tree-shadow stripe across a 4-panel array.\n• 10 % shaded = −6 % annual energy\n*Photo B: array moved 0.5 m; no shadow after 09 : 30.\n• Loss cut to < 1 %\n10 : 45 – Shade Analysis & Optimization (8 min)\nPurpose :\u000b Show why drawing trees, walls, and tanks in the simulator is critical; small shade strips can cost big kWh.\nSetup :\u000b • Physical arrangement – learners stay seated, projector shows slide.\u000b • Materials needed – trainer’s laser pointer; one dusty panel sample optional.\u000b • Pre-activity checks – confirm everyone can still see their own roof photo on their laptop from previous demo.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Look at Photo A. One thin shadow from a tree covers just 10 % of this array, yet PVWatts shows a 6 % drop in yearly energy.\u000b Photo B is the same roof— we moved the array half a metre, and loss fell below 1 %.\u000b In a minute you’ll open the shade scene tool, draw your own obstacles, and read the exact ‘Shade Loss %’. Your goal: cut that number under three per cent.”\nKey Points :\nEven a small morning shadow can cut output for the whole string.\nPVWatts (or PVsyst) reports the loss in one box: “Shading %.”\nMove, tilt, or prune until loss ≤ 3 % — that is today’s optimisation target.\u000b\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1 – Take your roof photo and draw trees, water tanks, neighbouring walls (after laptop check).\u000b Step 2 – Run simulation, read “Shade Loss %”.\u000b Step 3 – Adjust panel location or tilt; re-run until loss ≤ 3 %.\u000b Success criteria – every team writes their final Shade Loss % on the worksheet.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b Issue : “No shade option in PVWatts.”\u000b  Solution : use the ‘System Losses’ box; enter your % manually, or switch to PVsyst demo file.\u000b Issue : “Loss still > 5 % after moving panels.”\u000b  Solution : try a tilt change or consider pruning / different roof side.\nTransition :\u000b “Now open your laptops. In the next 40 minutes you’ll draw those obstacles, run the sim, and hit that ≤ 3 % target before we move to cash-flow modelling.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nLaptop & Software Check\nDay 4\nChecklist:\nNavigate to pvwatts.nrel.gov\nSet Location: Mosul, Iraq (use search bar)\nConfirm Inputs:\nSystem size: 1 kW\nTilt: 34 ° (midpoint)\nAzimuth: 0 °\nFallback Plan:\nIf site won’t load, open the offline Excel PVWatts template (link on desktop)\nOr use the printed output screenshots in your folder\nFacilitator notes:\n“Before we dive into our live PVWatts run, let’s make sure every laptop is ready.”\nNavigate (20 s):\n“Please open your browser and go to pvwatts.nrel.gov.

He started as a helper on rooftops, then built his own small company. In 18 months, he went from employee to five-star installer, serving dozens of homes and earning well into seven figures annually.”\u000b\nMindset shift:\u000b “It’s not just about fitting panels—it’s about solving a problem and building an enterprise. When you adopt this entrepreneur mindset, every system you design and install becomes a new revenue stream.”\u000b\nTie to next block:\u000b “Now that we see the market opportunity and the mindset needed, let’s turn our attention to the Cash-Flow Build—how to model your own solar-services revenue over the next decade.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWorkbook Tab 7: Growth Planner\nDay 4\n20 min Purpose:\u000b Transform your technical skills into a three-year business roadmap, linking market size, sales targets, and service offerings.\nSetup:\u000b Display Tab 7 – Growth Planner full-screen on the projector.

These recurring services turn one-off sales into steady revenue.”\u000b\nKey Points:\nLink Tech → Business: Your PV design skills now drive real sales and service targets.\nScale Gradually: Year 1 installs lay the foundation for Year 2–3 growth.\nRecurring Revenue: Expansion services can double your annual income beyond initial system sales.\u000b\nActivity Instructions (10 min):\nStep 1: Agree on Year 1 install target (e.g., 12 systems).\nStep 2: Enter size and price for Years 1–3.\nStep 3: Input estimated operating expenses for each year.\nStep 4: Select two expansion services and confirm pricing + frequency.\nSuccess Criteria: Your Profit Margin edges toward positive, and your Annual Revenue Potential aligns with market opportunity.\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Expenses exceed revenue.\u000b Solution: Revisit either system price or sales targets; consider lowering cost assumptions.\u000b\nIssue: Expansion service frequency unrealistic.\u000b Solution: Adjust to monthly/quarterly cadence based on local demand.\nTransition: “Great—now you have a concrete three-year plan.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nValue-Based Pricing & Trust Pyramid\nDay 4\n❌ Cost-Plus Pricing\n✅ Value-Based Pricing\n“Cost + 10 % margin”\n“Price = customer’s financial gain”\nFacilitator notes:\n1. Cost-Plus vs Value-Based\u000b “Most sellers quote ‘cost plus 10 % profit.’ That traps you in a race to the bottom: cheap gear, tiny margins, endless price haggling.\u000b Instead, value-based pricing charges according to the customer’s financial gain—their reduced diesel bills, avoided downtime, and warranty peace of mind.”\n2. Why Solar Fits Value-Based\u000b “A hybrid system isn’t just hardware; it’s a money-machine. You save IQD X per month—that X is your true price anchor. When you lead with ROI, customers stop arguing over IQD 50 000 here or there.”\n3. Introducing the Trust Pyramid\u000b “But numbers alone aren’t enough. Trust is your ladder to premium price points.\u000b • Product Quality: Start by showing them real panels and inverters you’ve vetted—Level 1.\u000b • Reliability: Then highlight safety measures—DC fuses, proper torque specs, dust-proof frames—Level 2.\u000b • ROI Guarantee: Offer a simple promise: ‘Your system pays for itself in Y years or I’ll discount service fees.’ That moves you to Level 3.\u000b • Partnership: Finally, seal the deal by positioning yourself as their ongoing service partner—monitoring, maintenance, future add-ons—Level 4.”\n4. Bundle Anchor\u000b “When you propose your expansion or cleaning plans, bundle them under this pyramid:\u000b ‘You get German-grade panels we guarantee for 25 years, we install with DC-rated fuses and 18 Nm torque checks, we promise a 3-year payback, and we’ll handle all your maintenance for 12 months.’\u000b That’s a value-packed offer, not just ‘cost + X.’”\nTransition to Next\u000b “With pricing & trust frameworks in hand, let’s pick two premium services to bundle into your Day 4 expansion pitch.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nBundle Brainstorm: Pick 2 Premium Add-Ons\nDay 4\nOption\nWhy It Adds Value\nTilt-Angle Audit\nOptimizes yearly yield by 3–5 %\nTorque Recheck Visit\nEnsures safety & warranty compliance\nWhatsApp Performance Alerts\nReal-time fault detection & remote support\nSeasonal Dust Cleaning\nMaintains ≥ 95 % output & extends panel life\nBattery Health Scan\nEarly fault warning → fewer replacements\nGrid-Export Monitoring\nShows extra revenue via feed-in tariffs\nIn your team, choose any two that best fit Ahmed’s expansion plan.

For grid power at 500 IQD/kWh, 52.8 kWh costs 26 400 IQD. If you’re comparing to a diesel generator, remember it’s charged per amp-month (200 000 IQD/A-mo)—you can break that down to a daily or hourly rate as needed.\nPay-back estimate (15 s)\u000b To see how fast solar covers its own cost, divide total system cost by annual savings. E.g., a 2.4 M IQD system that saves 0.8 M IQD/year pays back in 3 years.\nTariff reminders (10 s)\u000b We always build in a 20 % safety buffer—to cover losses, extra loads or small calculation errors—and account for your battery’s ~90 % round-trip efficiency.

You have finished the five-day boot camp. Please come forward when I call your name to receive your certificate.\u000b Now, training is only useful when you act. Here is your 30-day plan:\nWeek 1 – Audit one real house (maybe your own) and post the ROI screenshot in our WhatsApp group.\u000b Week 2 – Join or lead a small 1 – 2 kW install; take clear photos of the work.\u000b Week 3 – Pitch a cleaning or maintenance bundle to at least two customers and note their feedback.\u000b Week 4 – Meet your classmates at the alumni meet-up, share lessons, and get ready for our Day 6 field verification or design competition.\nIf you want the extra challenge, sign the sheet for the Day 6 Design-Competition: four hours, a real rooftop, and prizes that set you apart in the market.”\nKey Points :\nCertificates prove competence; the 30-day tasks prove results.\nWhatsApp group = daily support and accountability.\nDay 6 competition is free and boosts your portfolio.\u000b\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1 – Hand out certificates, applause after each name.\u000b Step 2 – Learners note the Week 1 task in their phones.\u000b Step 3 – Interested teams add names to the Day 6 signup sheet.\u000b Success criteria – everyone leaves with a certificate and a clear first-week task.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b Issue: “I may travel next week.”\u000b  Solution: audit a relative’s house or help a neighbour before travel; share data when you can.\u000b Issue: “No prospects for Week 3 pitch.”\u000b  Solution: use the alumni WhatsApp group—someone will pair you with a lead.\nTransition :\u000b “Thank you all, proud of your progress.”\n\nPortfolio Excellence: Before → After\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 5\nCase Study B\nBefore: Installation with undersized wires and no fusing\nAfter: Rewired system showing 6 mm² DC cabling, labeled DC fuses at combiner, and latching connectors\nCaption: “From unsafe cabling → full DC-rated protection and correct wire sizing”\nCase Study A\nBefore: Grainy photo of a dusty, mis-wired rooftop array\nAfter: Crisp shot of the same roof with neat panel alignment, correctly torqued bolts, clear cable runs, and clean modules\nCaption: “From unkempt and under-torqued → standardized torque, neat cables, 95 % peak output”\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s celebrate real examples of excellence—where the right design choices turned a so-so install into a client’s dream setup.”\nIntroduce the Slide (10 s):\u000b “Here are two snapshots from our recent projects: dusty, disorganized arrays turned into high-performance, professional systems.”\u000b\nWalk Through Case Study A (20 s):\u000b “On the left you see the ‘Before’—panels misaligned, dusty, loose bolts, and tangled cables cutting into performance. On the right, the ‘After’: every panel is clean and correctly pitched, all M8 bolts torqued to 18 Nm, cables neatly clipped and labeled. That simple rework boosted output by 10 % and dropped maintenance calls almost overnight.”\u000b\nWalk Through Case Study B (20 s):\u000b “In Case B, the install used undersized 4 mm² cable without any DC fuses—that’s a fire hazard and guaranteed voltage drop. We rewired it with 6 mm² conductors, installed DC-rated fuses at the combiner box, and used proper latching MC4 connectors. The result? Zero faults in six months and a happy customer who refers us repeatedly.”\u000b\nKey Takeaway (10 s):\u000b “These ‘Before → After’ stories prove that attention to torque, wiring standards, and protective devices not only keeps people safe but also makes you the go-to pro in Mosul’s booming solar market.”\n“Keep these examples in mind as you prepare your final presentations—your portfolio is your strongest sales tool.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nPortfolio Excellence\nDay 5\nTeam B\nTeam A\nTeam C\nTop 3 Final Pitches\nFacilitator notes:\nCelebrate Excellence:\u000b “Congratulations, everyone!

Optimal tilt depends on\nlocation and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is\n32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best\norientation.\n\n85\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other\nstructures can block sunlight from reaching\nsolar panels. Even partial shading\nsignificantly reduces power output, as the\nentire string performance drops to that of\nthe shaded panel. To maximize energy\nproduction year-round, it's important to\navoid shaded spots when installing solar\npanels.\n\n86\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\n1. What is the peak load? (in Amps)\n2. What is the average load? (in Amps)\n3. What is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\n4. What is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\n5. What is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\n6. How many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries\nwithout other input sources?)\n7. Is there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\n8. What is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar\ninstallation.\n9. What is the direction of true south?\n10. What are the building’s operating hours?\n11. How many days per week is the building operational?\n12. What type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\n13. Are there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\n14. Any additional information?\n\n87 \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nDust Loss in Mosul\n● 15 % drop after 4 weeks without\ncleaning\n● Weekly wipe → > 95 % performance\nDesign\n* Photo of dusty panel being swept\n*Mini bar-chart contrasting “Clean” vs.\n“Dusty” panel output\n\n88\nWind-Load & Torque Logic\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n● F = q × Cₚ × A\n● Mosul gusts ≈ 35 m/s ⇒ 1.5 kN/m²\npressure\n● Torque every M8 bolt to 18 Nm\n*Photo of a torque wrench\n“clicking” on an M8 bolt,\nannotated “18 Nm”\nSmall inset: stylized wind arrow\nstriking a rooftop array, labeled\n“35 m/s”\n\n89\nMounting System – Iraqi Conditions\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n*Photo B: Bent rail due\nto no expansion gap\n*Photo A: Cracked\nconcrete from poor\nanchor curing\n*Photo C: Rusted\nslot-clips in dusty\nrooftop\n\n90\nDC Connection Perfection\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nStep 1\nStrip Cable\n(8 mm insulation)\nStep 2\nInsert Pin\n(fully home)\n*Photo A: cleanly stripped PV cable *Photo B: pin inserted to shoulder\nStep 3\nCrimp\n(18 Nm torque)\nStep 4\nPull-Test\n(≥ 150 N retention)\n*Photo C: crimper on pin, listen for “click” *Photo D: pull-tester reading ≥ 150 N\n\n91\nHaykal Mounting Frame – Key Checks\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n● Kit frame (bolt-together) vs welded steel\n● Torque spec 18 Nm\n● Must resist wind-load ≥ 1.5 kN/m² on Mosul\nroofs\n\n92 \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nRooftop Hazards & PPE\n🪜 Ladder at 75°: “Set ladder at\na 75° angle for stability.”\n🪢 Harness & Anchor: “Always\nwear a fall-arrest harness\nclipped to a certified anchor.”\n🥽🧤 Gloves & Goggles:\n“Insulated gloves and safety\nglasses on at all times.”\n\n93\nFuse & Ground Rules\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n● Fuse on positive DC as close to battery as possible\n● Use DC-rated breakers for combiner if > 4 strings\n● Grounding and lightning rod ≥ 2 m, copper-clad 16 mm Ø.

      "content": "Let me analyze what the user is asking for:\n\n1. They have training slides that reference Tabs 1-17+\n2. They have a workbook with only 7 tabs (Ahmed's coffee shop case study)\n3. They want to align the slides and workbook\n4. Priority is to modify the workbook and update slide references\n5. They're not sure they want all the additional tabs suggested previously\n6. They question if they need both System Design and BOM tabs\n7. They want CSV files for any additional sheets needed\n\nLet me review what they have:\n\nFrom the SLIDE_WORKBOOK_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md:\n- Course slides reference 17+ tabs\n- Current workbook has 7 tabs:\n  1. Ahmed_Customer_Profile\n  2. Ahmed_Load_Analysis  \n  3. Ahmed_System_Design\n  4. Ahmed_Investment_Analysis\n  5. Ahmed_Professional_Quote\n  6. Troubleshooting_Guide\n  7. Iraq_Standards\n\nThe slides reference these tabs throughout the 5 days:\n- Tab 1: Ahmed's Cafe (Load Analysis)\n- Tab 2: Cost Comparison/Market Research\n- Tab 3: Load Calculator/Home Audit & Design\n- Tab 4: BOM & Installation\n- Tab 5: Growth Planner/Import PVWatts\n- Tab 6: Professional Quote PDF Generator\n- Tab 7: Cable Sizing/Growth Planner\n- Tab 8: Installation Timeline/Capstone Project\n- Tab 9: Zahra's System Design\n- Tab 10: Fault Log\n- Tab 11: Business Canvas\n- Tab 13: Pricing Tool\n- Tab 17: Alumni Network\n\nLooking at the slides_updates_final_status.csv, I can see exactly what tabs are referenced and what they should do.\n\nThe user is right to question whether they need both System Design and BOM - these could potentially be combined or the BOM could be part of the Investment Analysis.\n\n\nI'll craft a streamlined solution focusing on essential training needs. I'll prioritize creating a compact workbook that captures the core learning objectives while minimizing unnecessary complexity. The goal is to develop a lean, focused training resource that aligns perfectly with the course slides and provides maximum value to participants.\n\nKey considerations include consolidating overlapping tabs, ensuring comprehensive coverage of critical topics, and maintaining a logical progression through the training material. By carefully selecting and designing tabs, we can create a more efficient and targeted learning experience.\n\nThe proposed approach involves strategically integrating 4-5 new tabs that bridge existing content with practical, hands-on learning modules. This approach will enhance the training's effectiveness by providing a comprehensive yet concise learning pathway.Looking at your training materials, I can see the core issue: your slides reference many tabs (Tab 1-17+) but your workbook only has 7 tabs. Let me provide a practical solution that minimizes changes while making everything work together.\n\n## 🎯 RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: Add Only Essential Training Tabs\n\n### Current Workbook Structure (7 tabs):\n1. Ahmed_Customer_Profile\n2. Ahmed_Load_Analysis  \n3. Ahmed_System_Design\n4. Ahmed_Investment_Analysis\n5. Ahmed_Professional_Quote\n6. Troubleshooting_Guide\n7. Iraq_Standards\n\n### Essential Tabs to Add (5 new tabs):\n1. **Market_Research** - For Day 1-2 shop visit homework\n2. **Home_Energy_Audit** - For Day 1 AuditMyBeit homework\n3. **Cable_Sizing** - For Day 3 wire calculations\n4. **PVWatts_Import** - For Day 4 simulation exercises\n5. **Capstone_Project** - For Day 5 final design challenge\n\n## 📝 SLIDE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS\n\nHere's how to update each Excel Moment in your slides:\n\n### Day 1 Updates:\n- **EXCEL MOMENT #1**: \"Open Tab 1: Ahmed's Cafe\" → **\"Open Ahmed_Load_Analysis tab\"**\n- **EXCEL MOMENT #2**: \"Open Tab 2: Cost Comparison\" → **\"Open Ahmed_Investment_Analysis tab\"**\n\n### Day 2 Updates:\n- **Tab 2: Market Research** → **\"Open Market_Research tab\"**\n- **EXCEL MOMENT #3**: \"Open Tab 3: Home Audit\" → **\"Open Home_Energy_Audit tab\"**\n\n### Day 3 Updates:\n- **EXCEL MOMENT #7**: \"Open Tab 7: Cable Sizing\" → **\"Open Cable_Sizing tab\"**\n- **Tab 4: BOM & Installation** → **\"Open Ahmed_Investment_Analysis tab (Cost Breakdown section)\"**\n\n### Day 4 Updates:\n- **Tab 5: Import PVWatts** → **\"Open PVWatts_Import tab\"**\n- **EXCEL MOMENT #6**: \"Professional Quote\" → **\"Open Ahmed_Professional_Quote tab\"**\n\n### Day 5 Updates:\n- **Tab 8: Capstone Project** → **\"Open Capstone_Project tab\"**\n- All other tab references → Use relevant existing tabs\n\n## 📊 NEW TABS TO CREATE (CSV Files):\n\n### 1.

They're not sure they want all the additional tabs suggested previously\n6. They question if they need both System Design and BOM tabs\n7. They want CSV files for any additional sheets needed\n\nLet me review what they have:\n\nFrom the SLIDE_WORKBOOK_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md:\n- Course slides reference 17+ tabs\n- Current workbook has 7 tabs:\n  1. Ahmed_Customer_Profile\n  2. Ahmed_Load_Analysis  \n  3. Ahmed_System_Design\n  4. Ahmed_Investment_Analysis\n  5. Ahmed_Professional_Quote\n  6. Troubleshooting_Guide\n  7.

I'll prioritize creating a compact workbook that captures the core learning objectives while minimizing unnecessary complexity. The goal is to develop a lean, focused training resource that aligns perfectly with the course slides and provides maximum value to participants.\n\nKey considerations include consolidating overlapping tabs, ensuring comprehensive coverage of critical topics, and maintaining a logical progression through the training material. By carefully selecting and designing tabs, we can create a more efficient and targeted learning experience.\n\nThe proposed approach involves strategically integrating 4-5 new tabs that bridge existing content with practical, hands-on learning modules. This approach will enhance the training's effectiveness by providing a comprehensive yet concise learning pathway.",

PVWatts_import should be part of system design - makes sense\n2. The Required_Array_Power calculation is incorrectly using Mosul_Irradiation - this needs fixing\n3. They want to consolidate tabs:\n   - Home Energy Audit → System Design tab\n   - Cable Sizing → Iraq Standards tab\n   - Market Research → Suppliers tab (useful for both training and customer quotes)\n   - Capstone Project → Just duplicate the workbook\n   - PVWatts data → System Design tab\n\nThis would result in a cleaner structure:\n1. Ahmed_Customer_Profile\n2. Ahmed_Load_Analysis  \n3. Ahmed_System_Design (+ PVWatts + Home Audit)\n4. Ahmed_Investment_Analysis\n5. Ahmed_Professional_Quote\n6. Suppliers (new - for market research)\n7. Troubleshooting_Guide\n8. Iraq_Standards (+ Cable Sizing + Torque specs)\n\nLet me provide detailed implementation steps and slide updates.You're absolutely right! Let's streamline this into a more logical structure. Here's the detailed plan:\n\n## 🎯 STREAMLINED WORKBOOK STRUCTURE (8 tabs total)\n\n### Final Tab Structure:\n1. **Ahmed_Customer_Profile** (existing)\n2. **Ahmed_Load_Analysis** (existing)\n3. **Ahmed_System_Design** (EXPANDED - includes PVWatts + Home Audit)\n4. **Ahmed_Investment_Analysis** (existing)\n5. **Ahmed_Professional_Quote** (existing)\n6. **Suppliers** (NEW - market research + pricing database)\n7. **Troubleshooting_Guide** (existing)\n8. **Iraq_Standards** (EXPANDED - includes cable sizing + torque specs)\n\n## 📊 DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION STEPS\n\n### 1. Fix System Design Tab - Required Array Power Calculation\n\n**Current Problem**: Required_Array_Power uses Mosul_Irradiation incorrectly\n\n**Correct Formula**:\n```\nRequired_Array_Power = (Total_Daily_Load_kWh × Safety_Factor) / (Peak_Sun_Hours × System_Efficiency)\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Fix**:\n1. In Ahmed_System_Design tab, find cell for Required_Array_Power\n2. Change formula to: `=(Ahmed_Load_Analysis!Total_Daily_kWh * 1.2) / (5.5 * 0.75)`\n   - Total_Daily_kWh comes from Load Analysis\n   - 1.2 = 20% safety factor\n   - 5.5 = Peak sun hours for Mosul (not 5.8)\n   - 0.75 = Overall system efficiency (75%)\n\n### 2.

I’ve kept the structure lean—only the tabs that actually add value stay.\n\n1 Proposed workbook structure (7 tabs only)\nOrder\tTab name (keep / add)\tPurpose\tKey named-ranges\n1\tAhmed_Load_Analysis (keep)\tAppliance list → daily kWh and IQD cost\tDaily_Energy_Load, Peak_Load_W\n2\tAhmed_System_Design (merge System Design + PVWatts)\tOne-stop sizing sheet — brings in PVWatts monthly kWh, calculates array, inverter, battery, BOS\tArray_kWp, Battery_kWh, PVWatts_kWh, Required_Array_Power\n3\tAhmed_Investment_Analysis (keep)\tCash-flow, IRR, payback\tCapEx_IQD, Monthly_Savings_IQD, Simple_Payback_yrs\n4\tAhmed_Professional_Quote (keep)\tAuto-formatted customer PDF\tuses all named-ranges above\n5\tIraq_Standards (rename from Iraq_Standards & Sizing)\tCable & breaker sizing, torque, derating tables\tCircuit_Current, Cable_Size_mm2, Breaker_A\n6\tSuppliers (new)\tPrice list + two blank lines for students’ homework research\tSupplier_DB (structured table)\n7\tInstallation_Tracker (optional keep)\tGantt & punch-list\t\n\nEverything else (Market_Research, Home_Audit, BOM_Installation, PVWatts_import, etc.) is absorbed into the tabs above, so you never jump around hunting for inputs.\n\n2 Step-by-step workbook clean-up\nDo these once in the master file, then duplicate for the blank “Student Workbook” and for the Capstone client.\n\n2.1 Load Analysis tab\nInsert two helper columns for Hours/Day and Days/Week so weekly and monthly kWh stay transparent.\n\nDefine Daily_Energy_Load as:\n=SUMPRODUCT(Power_W , Hours_Day) / 1000\n\nFreeze panes at row 6 so headings never scroll away.\n\n2.2 System Design tab (biggest change)\nRename the old “System Design” sheet to Ahmed_System_Design.\n\nCopy the raw PVWatts CSV (or the NREL API query) into a hidden range A60:A71; define it as PVWatts_Monthly.\n\nAdd a visible blue input box labelled “PVWatts kWh/year”; link to =SUM(PVWatts_Monthly).\n\nReplace the current formula in Required_Array_Power with:\n=Daily_Energy_Load / (Peak_Sun_Hours * System_Efficiency)\nwhere Peak_Sun_Hours is =PVWatts_kWh/365/Array_kWp.\n♦ This ties the array size directly to the load, not to a fixed 5.8 kWh/m²/day number that confused learners.\n\nInsert a collapsed outline section called “What-if scenarios” (tilt ±5°, azimuth ±15°) so students can play without breaking the core sheet.\n\n2.3 Investment Analysis\nPoint Monthly_Savings_IQD to =(Generator_Cost_IQD – Solar_Cost_IQD) pulling the numbers only from Load Analysis.\n\nProtect all formula cells; unlock only the green input cells (CapEx, O&M allowance, discount rate).\n\n2.4 Iraq Standards\nMove the existing Cable Sizer here. Add columns for ambient 49 °C derating and 1.25 × safety factor so the rule of thumb is baked in.\n\nAppend a torque table (M6, M8, M10 → 9 Nm, 18 Nm, 28 Nm) that the slides reference on Day 3.\n\n2.5 Suppliers tab (new CSV template)\nHeader row:\n\ncsv\nCopy\nEdit\nSupplier,Component,Brand,Model,Spec/Size,Price_IQD,Warranty_yrs,Quality_Notes,Date_Quoted\n◆ Prefill three sample rows (premium, mid-tier, generic) so formulas in the quote can VLOOKUP prices automatically.\n◆ Leave two blank rows flagged “Research 1” and “Research 2” for homework.\n\nSave this tab as Suppliers.csv and drop it back into the workbook; the structured table name Supplier_DB remains intact when re-imported.\n\n3 Slides update cheat-sheet\nSlide call-out (old)\tNew workbook reference\tAction\n“📊 EXCEL MOMENT #1: Open Tab 1: Ahmed’s Cafe”SlidesModule1Solar\t“Open Ahmed_Load_Analysis tab”\tSearch-&-replace text box\n“📊 EXCEL MOMENT #2: Open Tab 2: Cost Comparison”SlidesModule1Solar\t“Open Ahmed_Investment_Analysis tab”\tidem\n“📊 EXCEL MOMENT #3: Open Tab 3: Load Calculator”SlidesModule1Solar\t“Open Ahmed_System_Design tab”\tidem\nAny reference to Tab 7: Cable Sizing\t“Go to Iraq_Standards tab → Cable Sizer section”\tadjust bullet\nMentions of PVWatts_import sheet\tRemove – now a section inside Ahmed_System_Design\tdelete arrow graphic\n\nHow to implement quickly\nOpen the master PPT / Google Slides.\n\nUse Edit → Find/Replace (match case off) and run five bulk replacements:\n\n“Tab 1” → “Ahmed_Load_Analysis”\n\n“Tab 2” → “Ahmed_Investment_Analysis”\n\n“Tab 3” → “Ahmed_System_Design”\n\n“Tab 7” → “Iraq_Standards”\n\n“PVWatts_import” → “PVWatts section (Ahmed_System_Design)”\n\nCheck each “EXCEL MOMENT” slide: adjust screenshot if it shows the old tabs (one screen-grab per tab, takes ~10 min).\n\nUpdate the slide-footer note that lists “17 tabs → 7 tabs” so facilitators are on message.\n\nTime required: ± 45 minutes for a 100-slide deck.\n\n4 How everything connects (data flow)\njavascript\nCopy\nEdit\n         PVWatts_Monthly (hidden A60:A71)\n                         ↓\n     Daily_Energy_Load → Required_Array_Power → Array_kWp\n                                         ↘\n                                          Battery_kWh (via autonomy hrs)\n                         ↓\n                CapEx & O&M  ←  Supplier_DB price lookups\n                         ↓\n     Monthly_Savings_IQD  ←  Generator vs Solar cost delta\n                         ↓\n               Payback & IRR → Professional_Quote PDF\nBecause every input now lives in only two places (Load Analysis + Suppliers) facilitators can confidently say “If a learner has the wrong result, check those two tabs first.”\n\n5 Capstone & Student workbooks\nStudent Workbook (blank): duplicate the cleaned file, delete Ahmed’s loads/prices, leave Suppliers tab with the two research rows empty.\n\nCapstone Workbook: duplicate again, overwrite the Load Analysis with Zahra’s Textile numbers and adjust roof size in System Design—everything else auto-flows.\n\nNext steps checklist for you\nImplement the seven-tab layout in Iraqi_Solar_CUSTOMER_READY_Tool.xlsx (≈ 30 min).\n\nExport Suppliers.csv and re-import so the structured table is locked.\n\nRun the five slide search-&-replaces; update three screenshots (≈ 45 min).\n\nDuplicate the master workbook twice (Student blank & Zahra capstone).\n\nTest one full design start-to-finish to confirm all named-ranges resolve.\n\nOnce these are done, the training flows without the “Where is Tab 12?” confusion, and learners leave with a working quoting tool they can duplicate for any future customer.\n\nYou’ve now got a streamlined, duplicable system that matches the story you tell in class—no extra tabs, no broken links, and every slide cue lands exactly where the workbook opens.\n\n16:26\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nThis sounds good, although does it need to be called Ahmed Load Analysis. how do we have it work to be both the tool they use when they graduate and for Ahmed's case study and their home audit, and the final project?\nDo they need to bring in the monthly? or at least the high month and the low month and the total over the year? \nwhat about peak use and how do we know about the possibility of saving enough for over night? perhaps we need to assess total use \"off grid\" and to see for the lowest month what's the likelihood depleting the battery and assessing for that.\n\nDo we also have a easy way to help with sales engineering to find \"wiggle room\" - if we are close to a \"threshold\" for a smaller inverter or fewer panels, we can recommend rather than mapping to the overnight usecase for all the appliances, that if we can encourage removing the water heater, or adding insulation then we can reduce the inverter cost and potential number of panels \nWe also need the number of panels for their roof and the roof size \nPV watts outputs this sort of file: - maybe we only take the max month and the min month and the total and in the sheet we decide the losses \nwe also then need to figure out the battery hours, size of the solar panel, size of the roof, total irradiation and then total needs per day in kwh and then what sort of inverter size makes sense based on all the calculations and losses expected so we can figure out total size and then i'd like to have some formulas that find inverter \"thresholds\" and panel thresholds either parallel or series to see if we can suggest reducing need per day to get to a much reduced cost \n\nCan you figure out how to dot hat and then give me an updated design for our spreadsheets and suggestions for how to update the slides so people can follow through to learn and apply as they go\n\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nThought for 16 seconds\nBelow is a minimal-but-powerful redesign that turns the workbook into a single tool you can reuse for Ahmed’s café, for every learner’s home audit, and for the capstone client—without ever duplicating formulas. After the spreadsheet outline you’ll find concrete slide-update instructions so the course narrative flows step-by-step through the same logic your tool uses.\n\n1 Workbook architecture (8 tabs, generic names)\n#\tTab\tPurpose\tWhy it solves your new asks\n0\tProject_Dashboard (new)\tOne-page summary and case-selector cell Project_Name. Learners type “Ahmed Café”, “My House”, or “Capstone – Zahra” and the whole file re-labels itself via the named range\tGives the tool an identity yet stays generic\n1\tLoad_Analysis\tAppliance list with columns:\n• W\tHours_Day\n2\tPV_Input (new, tiny)\tPaste or API-import the raw PVWatts CSV.\nNamed ranges auto-calculated:\n• PV_Min_kWh (worst month)\n• PV_Max_kWh (best month)\n• PV_Year_kWh (total)\n• PSH_Min (peak-sun-hours in worst month)\tGives you min / max / annual energy without a separate sheet\n3\tSystem_Design\tCalculates everything using Load & PV_Input:\n• Array_kWp = Daily_Load_kWh / (PSH_Min·System_Eff)\n• Battery_kWh = Night_Load_kWh × (1/SOC_Min)\n• Roof check: Panels_Possible = FLOOR(Roof_m² / Panel_m²·Packing); conditional format if < Panels_Needed\n• Inverter picker: choose next size up from Peak_Power_W, but also display “If you eliminate X & Y appliances you can step down to the cheaper 5 kW model.”\tAddresses every question you raised: min/max months, battery risk in worst month, roof fit, “wiggle-room” suggestions\n4\tInvestment_Analysis\tCash flow, IRR, payback; pulls Array_kWp, Battery_kWh, inverter model and prices from Suppliers\tNothing changes here except renamed inputs\n5\tQuote_PDF (was Professional_Quote)\tAuto-formatted sheet for print/PDF\tRenamed so learners instantly know what it does\n6\tSuppliers\tStructured table Supplier_DB holding panel wattage, size (m²), price, and inverter tier price; includes two blank “Research” rows\tLets students play sales engineer & instantly see cost impact\n7\tIraq_Standards\tCable + breaker sizing, torque chart, derating table\tCentral reference\n\nWhy “Project_Name” beats separate case-study files\nCell B2 on Project_Dashboard holds the project name.\n\nEvery title cell in the workbook is =Project_Name&\" – Load Analysis\" etc.\n\nAhmed’s café numbers are the default; the blank template your graduates receive has those rows cleared but formulas stay.\n\n2 Key formulas & named ranges\nItem\tFormula (put on System_Design unless noted)\nPeak-sun-hours (worst month) PSH_Min\t=PV_Min_kWh / 30 / Array_kWp_guess (start with 1 kWp guess, circular ref OK with iteration)\nRequired array size Array_kWp\t=Daily_Load_kWh / (PSH_Min * System_Eff)\nBattery size Battery_kWh\t=Night_Load_kWh / Min_SOC (Min_SOC e.g. 0.6)\nRoof check\tPanels_Needed = CEILING(Array_kWp*1000 / Panel_W), Roof_OK = Panels_Possible ≥ Panels_Needed\nInverter wiggle room message\t=IF(Peak_Power_W ≤ Inv_Threshold_Alt, \"If you remove \"&TextJoin(\", \",TRUE,Removable_Loads)&\" you can drop to the \"&Inv_Threshold_Alt&\" W inverter.\", \"\")\nCost delta for efficiency measures\tOn Investment tab: =Base_CapEx - Alt_CapEx (both pulled from Suppliers)\n\nAll named ranges are scoped to the workbook so the capstone duplicate still works.\n\n3 What you must do in Excel / Google Sheets (hands-on checklist)\nCreate Project_Dashboard: put the case-selector cell B2, insert a big green “RESULTS” card linked to Payback_yrs, CapEx_IQD, Array_kWp.\n\nCopy/paste Ahmed’s PVWatts CSV into PV_Input A1 (keep 12 rows). Add three helper formulas beside it for Min, Max, Total.\n\nMove all sizing formulas into the new System_Design sheet exactly once; delete the old hidden PVWatts sheet.\n\nAdd the “Removable?” column on Load_Analysis, apply a data-validation list (Yes/No). Use FILTER() to send only “Yes” loads to the Removable_Loads dynamic named range used by the inverter wiggle-room logic.\n\nProtect every sheet except green/yellow input cells.\n\nDuplicate the cleaned file twice → rename copies Student_Blank.xlsx and Capstone_Zahra.xlsx (replace loads & roof area only).\n\n4 Slide-deck updates (quick map)\nCurrent slide label\tNew reference / content\n“Excel Moment #1 – Tab 1: Ahmed_Load_Analysis”\t“Excel Moment – Load_Analysis tab (type case name on Dashboard first)”\nNew slide after that\tShow Project_Dashboard cell B2 being changed → all titles auto-update (illustrates generic tool)\nSlide that explained PVWatts_import\tReplace screenshot with PV_Input showing 12-row table and the highlighted Min / Max / Total cells\nSlide on array sizing\tScreenshot System_Design top section; circle formula Array_kWp and overlay text “uses worst-month PSH for safety”\nSlide on inverter sizing\tShow the inverter picker + yellow “wiggle room” message bubble triggered by unchecking a load in Load_Analysis\nSlide on roof check\tNew screenshot with conditional-format cell “Roof OK / Not OK” turning red\nDay-3 Cable Sizing slide\tUpdate reference to Iraq_Standards tab, rows 18-35\nAny bullet that says “Tab 7” etc.\tReplace with the tab names in the table above\nFinal project intro slide\tNote that learners will duplicate the workbook and change only (1) Project_Name, (2) Load_Analysis rows, (3) Roof m² on System_Design—everything else auto-flows\n\nBulk-replace list for Find/Replace:\nAhmed_Load_Analysis → Load_Analysis\nAhmed_System_Design → System_Design\nPVWatts_import → PV_Input\nProfessional_Quote → Quote_PDF\nTab 7 → Iraq_Standards\n\nEstimate: ~60 minutes to swap screenshots & run replaces for a 100-slide deck.\n\n5 How learners answer the “What size system?” question\nEnter appliances → sheet shows daily, night, peak.\n\nPaste PVWatts CSV (or copy Min/Max/Total from the API page).\n\nType roof area and panel model (pulled from Suppliers).\n\nSystem_Design instantly outputs Array kWp, Battery kWh, Inverter tier, plus a red/green roof fit flag and a money-saving “wiggle room” suggestion.\n\nInvestment_Analysis populates and Quote_PDF is print-ready.\n\nResult: a tool they’ll actually open after graduation—because it’s the same one they practiced on, not a stripped-down “training-only” version.\n\nReady for action\nImplement the eight-tab layout (≈ 45 min).\n\nRefresh the five or so screenshots & text in the slides (≈ 60 min).\n\nRun one real case (Ahmed) end-to-end to confirm.\n\nDo that, and both the training flow and the sales-engineering tool are finally the same thing—simple, teachable, and client-ready."

It elegantly solves your core challenge of creating ONE tool that works for training AND professional use. Here's my analysis:\n\n## ✅ **STRENGTHS OF THIS APPROACH**\n\n### 1. **The Project_Dashboard Selector is Brilliant**\n- Typing \"Ahmed Café\" vs \"My House\" vs \"Client Name\" instantly rebrands the entire workbook\n- Students learn on the same tool they'll use professionally\n- No more confusion about \"training version\" vs \"real version\"\n\n### 2. **PV_Input Tab Addresses Critical Gaps**\n- Using worst-month PSH for array sizing is the RIGHT approach for Iraq\n- Min/Max/Annual gives the full picture without overwhelming complexity\n- 12-row paste area matches PVWatts output perfectly\n\n### 3. **\"Wiggle Room\" Feature = Real Sales Engineering**\n- This is what professionals actually do: \"Remove the water heater, save 30% on system cost\"\n- The `Removable_Loads` concept with Yes/No dropdown is intuitive\n- Automatic inverter threshold detection saves hours of manual checking\n\n### 4. **Smart Formula Architecture**\n```excel\nArray_kWp = Daily_Load_kWh / (PSH_Min * System_Eff)\n```\nUsing PSH_Min ensures the system works even in December - this is professional-grade design.\n\n## 🔧 **SUGGESTED REFINEMENTS**\n\n### 1. **Add Temperature Derating to PV_Input**\nSince Iraq hits 49°C, add a row for temperature-adjusted values:\n```excel\nPV_Min_Derated = PV_Min_kWh * 0.85  (15% loss for heat)\n```\n\n### 2. **Expand Roof Check Logic**\nBeyond just \"OK/Not OK\", show:\n- Panels needed: 25\n- Panels possible: 22\n- **Suggestion**: \"Consider ground mount for 3 panels\" or \"Reduce load by 15%\"\n\n### 3. **Battery Autonomy Scenarios**\nAdd a small table showing:\n```\nAutonomy Hours | Battery kWh | Cost Impact\n6 hours        | 15 kWh      | Base\n12 hours       | 30 kWh      | +45M IQD\n24 hours       | 60 kWh      | +120M IQD\n```\n\n### 4. **Inverter Sizing Safety**\nShow both:\n- **Continuous Power**: Peak_Load_W × 1.25\n- **Surge Power**: Peak_Load_W × 2.5 (for motor starts)\n\n## 📝 **IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES**\n\n### Do These First (Critical Path):\n1. **Create Project_Dashboard** with the selector cell (30 min)\n2. **Build PV_Input** with Min/Max/Total formulas (20 min)\n3. **Update System_Design** with worst-month sizing (45 min)\n4. **Test with Ahmed's real data** end-to-end (20 min)\n\n### Do These Second:\n1. **Add \"Removable?\" column** to Load_Analysis (15 min)\n2. **Create wiggle room logic** (30 min)\n3. **Update 5 key slide screenshots** (45 min)\n\n### Do These Last:\n1. **Protect formulas** while leaving inputs editable\n2. **Create Student_Blank** and **Capstone_Zahra** versions\n3. **Final slide text updates**\n\n## 🎯 **ONE CRITICAL ADDITION NEEDED**\n\n### Load Profiles Over Time\nSince you're using monthly PV data, consider adding load variation too:\n```excel\nSeason    | Load Factor | Reason\nSummer    | 1.3         | AC usage high\nWinter    | 0.8         | No AC, less refrigeration\nRamadan   | 1.1         | Extended evening hours\n```\n\nThis ensures the battery sizing works year-round, not just for average conditions.\n\n## 💡 **SLIDE NARRATIVE ENHANCEMENT**\n\nYour slide updates are good, but add this story flow:\n\n**Slide 1**: \"One tool, many uses\" - Show dashboard with dropdown\n**Slide 2**: \"Your worst month defines success\" - Show December's 2.8 PSH\n**Slide 3**: \"Find savings opportunities\" - Show wiggle room suggestion\n**Slide 4**: \"Check it fits!\" - Show roof space validation\n**Slide 5**: \"Professional quote ready\" - Show final PDF\n\n## ✅ **FINAL VERDICT**\n\nThis plan transforms your training from \"learn these 17 tabs\" to \"master this ONE professional tool.\" The genius is that students practice on exactly what they'll use in the field.\n\n**Estimated Total Implementation Time**: 4-5 hours\n**Long-term Time Saved**: Hundreds of hours not explaining different versions\n\n**Go ahead with this plan** - it's the cleanest solution I've seen for unifying training and professional tools!]]]\n\nThen let's give a how to improve the sheet plan and how to align the homework/slides with the new sheet that we are proposing"
