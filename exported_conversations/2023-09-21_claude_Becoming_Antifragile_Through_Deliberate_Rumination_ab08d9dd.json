I was taking the Entrepreneurship Character Strengths Assessment from the School of Positive Psychology, the Values in Action Characters profile, to see if I could figure out the correlates for entrepreneurship in character traits to understand which ways of being led to persistent and successful entrepreneurs. Yet in the middle of this experiment, in the middle of this training, there was the Beirut terrible explosion that destroyed much of the city and shattered the dreams of many of the entrepreneurs in my program. While initially my research was attempting to identify the qualities, the ways of being that bring us to life, that bring us a sense of fulfillment and flourishing, and support us as well in creating healthy entrepreneurial projects, I suddenly found myself also confronted with the reality of trauma. And I thought that it would be potentially of service to the entrepreneurs in my program, the entrepreneurs that I work with in Lebanon and Iraq and the Middle East and North Africa and in all the places in the world that are experiencing great change and also sometimes trauma as we just saw in Morocco and in Libya. And as we know, none of us are exempt and in our fast changing futures, who knows when we will be confronted with difficulty. So the question came, is it possible to identify the qualities that support people growing through the difficulty? And it turns out that in the scientific literature, there is a factor less known than post-traumatic stress disorder called post-traumatic growth. And I began exploring the factors that relate to post-traumatic growth and how to bring them into the entrepreneurship programs I'm working on.\n\nAnd so after that experience and understanding that there are factors that are correlated with growth after a trauma, in today's trauma-informed culture it seems like every day there's a news article talking about resilience, trauma, and the importance of having a trauma-informed environment. The fact is most people are actually resilient. It is the norm. If you check out Bonanno's work you will see that resilience is what happens in the middle of the bell curve. There is a small minority that wind up having difficulties and that's what we call post-traumatic stress disorder, people that have long-term negative repercussions, and then there are another small minority that have long-term positive growth outcomes from the experience of difficulty. My question was can we begin to identify those factors and then can we create environments in our entrepreneurship ecosystem, in the entrepreneurial training programs, in our workplaces, in our organizations, in our schools to help us prepare for when the inevitable is bound to happen. We in the past had different support networks around us. As someone who currently works from home and lives far from family and from my dearest friends, I know that my work environment is a big part of my social and and emotional stability. How can we create workplaces that both promote goodness for the individual while simultaneously creating positive business outcomes and especially for social entrepreneurs positive environmental and social impact without burning out the people in our organizations? The research is clear. The data is coming back over and over and over again from the Gallup polls about disengaged workers costing trillions of dollars to the global economy that the time is now to take care of ourselves so that we can take care of our businesses and communities and create the change that we want to see in the world.\n\nI'm one of the co-founders of Bloom.pm, an accelerator that operates out of Lebanon regionally through its virtual entrepreneurship programs. And we have seen in the last years, since the economic collapse, since the revolution and protests, since the Beirut blast, since the devaluation of the currency, many people leaving Lebanon to find their fortunes elsewhere. The question is, do they have to? Many organizations and businesses and governments would prefer to continue to operate in Lebanon, in Morocco, in Tunis, in all of these places. And especially for me, importantly, I am originally from Iraq, and my parents wanted me to grow up in Iraq, but they couldn't because of the wars. And so ever since I was young, I always wondered, is it possible to build in these regions? Some research by ArabNet and the Conrad Stiftung Foundation has indicated that many people have left Lebanon and left their businesses, and a big reason is they're unable to cope with the stress of everyday life and prioritize their mental health. They're also moving abroad in search of quality of life and safety and security. All of these things are big components of well-being and decent work. This is why we are conducting a well-being at work survey, where we would like to identify what it's like in the ecosystem today. What might we be able to do to help our organizations, our governments, and us as individuals within our companies to bring more wellness to us individually, to our teams, to our organizations, and to our communities? Some things we cannot change. We cannot prevent a tsunami or a natural disaster, but how we talk to each other about it. In my research, it shows that that is actually a bigger determinant of whether or not the difficulties help us grow or collapse.\n\nSo back in 2020, immediately after the blast, I was unable to pull myself away from my computer, trying my best to coordinate rescue efforts, data collection, supporting non-stop, until my friend took my laptop away from me, took my phone away from me, and forced me to take a break. It wasn't until then that I realized that I had been overstressing, that I hadn't been sleeping or eating, and that I had been increasingly more effective, more and more ineffective, and less effective over time. And that there's a difference between exerting energy and making progress. Sometimes I like to give the example of someone in the water who doesn't know how to swim splashing and making a mess, versus someone who has taken lessons and uses far less energy but is making it to the other side of the shore. And that is what I would like to bring to our entrepreneurship ecosystem. With this survey, identifying how to bring positive change, starting with the individual, moving to the relational, and then out into the organizational. How can we bring practices that will help us enhance the strength and resiliency of our ecosystem and increase the likelihood that when something happens, we'll be prepared? In my research on post-traumatic growth and the factors, I found that two really important factors are, one, people have a strong social network. That means that our offices cannot be places where we don't trust our colleagues, where we are having back-office gossip, where we don't understand the intentions of our leadership. We need to create an environment of deep and meaningful relationships at work. This will be the first place that will create a buffer between whatever is happening and how we feel about it. Secondly, learning internal conversational skills called deliberate rumination. Intrusive rumination is complaining about what is happening and saying, why is this happening to me? Deliberate rumination is asking, accepting what is happening, what can I do about this situation? And we talk to each other about it.",

Reviewing the data in the context of the challenges that people in Lebanon have faced over the last year, the question was raised: How our programs may have had an impact on the people who were part of our programs? We are interviewing participants that went through the full 6 month (originally planned as 4 month) Accelerator Program (May-October 2020) and those who only went through the 2 week Sprint Program (in April 2020) to deepen the understanding of how people respond to and grow through challenging situations and how those responses differ within a program and outside a program. We’re doing this to identify better the factors which lead to Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG is defined below) to then include these factors more deeply into our programming.

This concept, illuminated by researchers Richard Tedeschi, PhD, and Lawrence Calhoun, PhD, revolutionizes our understanding of resilience, emphasizing that true growth often blossoms from the ashes of trauma. At Bloom, we are embarking on a mission to facilitate this growth, fostering environments where individuals and organizations don't just bounce back but leap forward, fully equipped to navigate the intricacies of an ever-changing world. The Expatodus: Unravelling the Underlying Triggers Before we forge ahead, it is vital to understand the depth of the existing crisis in areas like Lebanon, where a significant fraction of the workforce seeks refuge and opportunities abroad. Recent data uncovers alarming trends: About 66% prioritize moving abroad for a better quality of life Around 68% are seeking security and safety overseas 55% are drawn by superior financial opportunities abroad 38% find it imperative to prioritize their mental health, unable to cope with daily stresses in the region Understanding these nuances is critical as we devise strategies to foster post-traumatic growth, creating ecosystems that retain talent and nurture it to its fullest potential. Beyond Resilience: The Path of Post-Traumatic Growth George Bonanno's seminal research on resilience reveals a profound insight: resilience is commonplace. A minority navigate the pathways of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but a golden segment experiences post-traumatic growth. This growth signifies an elevation, a flourishing that comes with having navigated the complexity of trauma. Bonanno advocates for identifying and bolstering the factors that propel individuals towards this growth trajectory, moving beyond theoretical constructs to practical, real-world applications. This approach aims to foster what is often termed as \"antifragility\", presenting a tangible pathway to thriving amidst adversity. Cultivating Growth with Bloom: A Hands-On Approach At Bloom, we envision a world where this post-traumatic growth becomes a norm rather than an exception. Our library of activities is curated to facilitate this growth, offering individuals and organizations tangible strategies to navigate the complex landscape of trauma and emerge stronger and more vibrant. Imagine someone aspiring to cross a river. Instead of struggling against the currents, they move with finesse and awareness, using their knowledge and consciousness to facilitate a smoother journey. This metaphor embodies our approach at Bloom, nurturing environments where individuals and organizations can navigate the challenges of our times with grace and efficacy. Join the Movement: Participate in Our Well-being at Work Survey We gather insights directly from the community to forge a future where individuals and organizations can thrive. We have launched a comprehensive \"Well-being at Work\" survey to understand the current landscape of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in the MENA region. Your participation will help shape strategies and interventions that foster post-traumatic growth in our workplaces, creating environments where individuals, businesses, and communities flourish synergistically. We invite you to be a part of this vital initiative. Your insights will help chart a path of growth and resilience and inspire a future where wellness and success coexist harmoniously in our work environments. \\[Insert link to the survey here\\] Conclusion: Building a Future Where People and Planet Thrive As we forge ahead in these tumultuous times, the experiences from regions like Lebanon serve as potent reminders: trauma is an inevitable facet of our journey. However, we possess the tools and insights to foster growth amidst these challenges. By concentrating on post-traumatic growth and nurturing environments that facilitate this growth, we pave the way for a future where businesses and communities flourish, ready to face the inevitable challenges with resilience and enhanced capabilities. \"We are spearheading a movement where post-traumatic growth is not an exception but a norm, fostering a future where businesses and individuals thrive amidst adversities,\" shares a visionary entrepreneur in the region. Join us on this transformative journey. We welcome your thoughts, engagement, and active participation as we foster resilience and growth in the face of adversity.",

This concept, illuminated by researchers Richard Tedeschi, PhD, and Lawrence Calhoun, PhD, revolutionizes our understanding of resilience, emphasizing that true growth often blossoms from the ashes of trauma. \n\nAt Bloom, we are embarking on a mission to facilitate this growth, fostering environments where individuals and organizations don't just bounce back but leap forward, fully equipped to navigate the intricacies of an ever-changing world.\n\nThe Expatodus: Unravelling the Underlying Triggers\n\nBefore we forge ahead, it is vital to understand the depth of the existing crisis in areas like Lebanon, where a significant fraction of the workforce seeks refuge and opportunities abroad. Recent data uncovers alarming trends:\n\n- About 66% prioritize moving abroad for a better quality of life \n- Around 68% are seeking security and safety overseas\n- 55% are drawn by superior financial opportunities abroad\n- 38% find it imperative to prioritize their mental health, unable to cope with daily stresses in the region\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is critical as we devise strategies to foster post-traumatic growth, creating ecosystems that retain talent and nurture it to its fullest potential.\n\nBeyond Resilience: The Path of Post-Traumatic Growth \n\nGeorge Bonanno's seminal research on resilience reveals a profound insight: resilience is commonplace. A minority navigate the pathways of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but a golden segment experiences post-traumatic growth. This growth signifies an elevation, a flourishing that comes with having navigated the complexity of trauma.\n\nBonanno advocates for identifying and bolstering the factors that propel individuals towards this growth trajectory, moving beyond theoretical constructs to practical, real-world applications. This approach aims to foster what is often termed as \"antifragility\", presenting a tangible pathway to thriving amidst adversity.\n\nCultivating Growth with Bloom: A Hands-On Approach\n\nAt Bloom, we envision a world where this post-traumatic growth becomes a norm rather than an exception. Our library of activities is curated to facilitate this growth, offering individuals and organizations tangible strategies to navigate the complex landscape of trauma and emerge stronger and more vibrant. \n\nImagine someone aspiring to cross a river. Instead of struggling against the currents, they move with finesse and awareness, using their knowledge and consciousness to facilitate a smoother journey. This metaphor embodies our approach at Bloom, nurturing environments where individuals and organizations can navigate the challenges of our times with grace and efficacy.\n\nJoin the Movement: Participate in Our Well-being at Work Survey\n\nWe gather insights directly from the community to forge a future where individuals and organizations can thrive. We have launched a comprehensive \"Well-being at Work\" survey to understand the current landscape of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in the MENA region. \n\nYour participation will help shape strategies and interventions that foster post-traumatic growth in our workplaces, creating environments where individuals, businesses, and communities flourish synergistically. \n\nWe invite you to be a part of this vital initiative.
