Curriculum vs. Green School Quality Standard: Greening Every Learning Environment\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen School Quality Standard Recommendations\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\nDevelop a Green School Action Plan\n(Clear steps, responsibilities, and monitoring for sustainability initiatives)\n- The proposal outlines a structured Implementation Timeline for integrating climate resilience into the incubator curriculum.\n- The Curriculum Integration Strategy identifies specific intervention points in the Business Model Canvas (BMC).\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal includes structured phases, but it lacks explicit monitoring and evaluation plans to track progress.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce a progress tracking mechanism (e.g., feedback loops, sustainability progress dashboard for businesses).\nMonitor and Evaluate Progress\n(SMART targets, periodic evaluations, and avoiding greenwashing)\n- The proposal includes rubric-based evaluations for assessing resilience in the curriculum.\n- Key Deliverables mention an assessment of 32 curriculum sessions for improvement.\n✅ Alignment with improvement potential – The proposal addresses evaluation, but it doesn’t mention specific key performance indicators (KPIs) or methods for tracking business adaptation over time.\n➡ Recommendation: Develop clear KPIs such as:\n- % of businesses implementing climate resilience strategies\n- Success rates in securing climate-linked investments\n- Reduction in operational costs through energy efficiency\nFoster Community Engagement\n(Sharing sustainability best practices with the broader community)\n- The proposal includes case studies showcasing climate-resilient businesses in Iraq and internationally.\n- Additional services include business resilience coaching and policy & regulatory reports.\n✅ Good Alignment – The proposal focuses on community learning through real-world case studies.\n➡ Recommendation: Encourage peer learning and networking among entrepreneurs through sustainability forums, mentorship programs, or incubator alumni engagement.\nImprove Facilities and Operations\n(Water conservation, waste management, and infrastructure improvements for climate resilience)\n- The proposal focuses on business operations (lean operations, energy efficiency, sustainable supply chains).\n✅ Alignment in a business context – While the proposal integrates climate-conscious business operations, it doesn’t explicitly address waste management or water conservation.\n➡ Recommendation: Include training modules on circular economy principles and green infrastructure for businesses.\nEnhance Teaching and Learning\n(Integrate sustainability across subjects, participatory learning, hands-on projects)\n- Climate resilience is embedded across business modules, not treated as an isolated topic.\n- Uses Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a practical tool for integration.\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum ensures climate resilience is a core business skill.\n➡ Enhancement: Incorporate experiential learning, such as business simulations, hands-on resilience-building exercises, and real-time problem-solving workshops.\nStrengthen Policy and Stakeholder Engagement\n(Stakeholder workshops, engagement with indigenous knowledge, advocacy training)\n- The proposal includes a Policy & Regulatory Landscape Report to guide entrepreneurs on compliance and future climate policies.\n✅ Good Alignment – Addresses policy adaptation but lacks a community advocacy component.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce policy roundtables or stakeholder dialogues for entrepreneurs to actively engage in policy discussions on climate resilience.\nAddress Climate Resilience and Disaster Preparedness\n(Emergency planning, climate risk reduction strategies)\n- The proposal integrates risk management as a business skill, helping businesses anticipate and mitigate climate risks.\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum tackles climate risks through business continuity planning.\n➡ Enhancement: Add disaster preparedness training (e.g., what to do in case of climate-induced supply chain disruptions or extreme weather events).\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 2:\nClimate Resilience in Incubator Curriculum vs. GreenComp: The European Sustainability Competence Framework\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenComp Competence Area\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\nEmbodying Sustainability Values (Understanding ecological limits, fairness, and justice in sustainability)\n- Focuses on financial risk, supply chain adaptation, and business continuity.\n- Sustainability is framed as a business strategy, but ethical and social justice aspects are not emphasized.\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal integrates sustainability but does not explicitly address fairness and social justice in business models.\n➡ Recommendation: Expand on ethical decision-making and incorporate regenerative business models that prioritize fair trade, equity, and community impact.\nEmbracing Complexity in Sustainability (Systems thinking and understanding interdependencies)\n- Uses the Business Model Canvas (BMC) to integrate climate risks.\n- Focuses on business resilience but lacks a holistic understanding of sustainability interdependencies.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Addresses financial and operational resilience but does not fully incorporate systems thinking.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce training on interdependencies such as energy-water-food nexus, biodiversity impact, and circular economy strategies to help entrepreneurs see sustainability beyond business profits.\nFutures Literacy (Anticipating long-term sustainability risks and trends)\n- Encourages adaptation to market shifts but does not focus on future scenario planning.\n- Entrepreneurs are trained to react to changes rather than anticipate and shape the future.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Covers current risks but does not include foresight training for long-term climate resilience.\n➡ Recommendation: Implement scenario planning workshops where entrepreneurs map future sustainability trends, risks, and emerging green markets.\nAdaptability, Flexibility & Trade-offs (Navigating uncertainty and managing sustainability trade-offs)\n- Introduces staged adaptation strategies for businesses.\n- Focuses on short-term financial resilience rather than navigating long-term sustainability trade-offs.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Lacks structured decision-making for economic vs. environmental trade-offs.\n➡ Recommendation: Develop decision-making tools that help entrepreneurs balance profitability, sustainability, and resource constraints in uncertain conditions.\nExploratory Thinking (Innovating for sustainability, creating new solutions)\n- Uses case studies but lacks structured experimentation and innovation tools.\n- Encourages adapting to climate risks rather than leading innovation in sustainability.\n🔴 Needs Improvement – Does not integrate sustainability-driven business innovation.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce design thinking exercises, rapid prototyping, and sustainability innovation labs to encourage new green business models.\nCollective Action (Engaging stakeholders and working collaboratively for sustainability)\n- Businesses assess risks independently but lack structured collaboration mechanisms for sustainability.\n- No mention of peer learning, cooperative green initiatives, or public-private sustainability partnerships.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Lacks collaborative sustainability efforts.\n➡ Recommendation: Develop entrepreneurial peer learning networks, partnership-building exercises, and shared sustainability projects to scale collective impact.\nPolitical Agency (Understanding sustainability policies and regulations)\n- Covers ESG finance and climate-linked investment but lacks engagement with sustainability policy advocacy.\n- Entrepreneurs are trained to comply with existing policies but not to shape or influence them.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Addresses compliance but not advocacy.\n➡ Recommendation: Equip entrepreneurs with policy awareness training, climate policy advocacy strategies, and methods for engaging in sustainability governance.\nSustainable Business Practices & Innovation (Embedding sustainability in business models, finance, and value creation)\n- Focuses on risk management, energy efficiency, and green finance.\n- Lacks regenerative and circular economy business strategies.\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Covers risk reduction but does not emphasize creating sustainability-driven business value.\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce circular economy principles, regenerative business models, and impact measurement tools to help businesses become sustainability leaders, not just risk managers.\n\n]]]Can you use this document and the

happy you can join us today for the first day of Ignite! Today is all about getting to know each other, understanding the program, and setting the foundations for the next two weeks as you learn more about the market and your customers needs!\n1\n\n\n\nLET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER\u000b\n Name?\n Where you are from?\n Tell us your idea.\n What’s your superpower?\n10 minutes: Share\n\nIntroductions:\nBefore we get started, I would like to introduce myself and get to know all of you a bit better. Let's quickly go around the room and share:\nYour name,\nWhere you are from,\nTell us a little bit about your idea. Have you thought about any challenges related to resources or sustainability in your industry?\nAnd finally, if you had a superpower, what would it be (flying, reading minds, shape shifting, etc…)?\n\nThe trainers should start first. Then, go around the room so each person can introduce themselves.\n2\n\n09:00 am \t\tWelcome + Introductions!\n09:30 am\t\tFive One Labs & Ignite\n10:30 am\t\tDesign Sprint \n12:00 pm\t\tGroup Lunch\n01:30 pm\t\tUser Research \n04:30 pm\t\tWrap up\nAGENDA\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nAgenda: Now that we all know each other a little better, let’s get into the agenda for the day. \nThis morning we will spend some time understanding Five One Labs, the program, and what exactly you will be doing over the two weeks. This will be an opportunity to clarify any questions you still have and give you some insights on what is in store ahead through a design sprint!\nGroup Lunch: At 12:00 we will take a break and get lunch together. \nThis afternoon we will come back and get into user research. This is the first major session we will have. Here we will define our research plan for the next few weeks! Think about how people use and access resources related to your idea. Finally, we will wrap up around 4:30!\n\n3\n\nYES, AND….\n15 minutes: Icebreaker \n\n2 minutes: Explain the activity\nTrainers should conduct the “YES, AND…” Icebreaker\nMake teams of about 3-5\nState a problem or ask the group for a problem \nFor example:\nIt’s an extremely hot day, and I want to get into five one labs without using too much energy on cooling, how can I do that?\nIt is so hot outside, how can I get to and from work without sweating or ever feeling the heat?\n \n5 minutes: “No” technique:\nYou have 2 minutes to generate different crazy ideas to solve that problem. Generate as many as possible. But there is a rule! When one member in the team says an idea another one must say “no!” and come up with a completely different idea. This goes on and on until the 2 minutes are up. You have to do this quickly, let's see how many crazy ideas we will get.\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nUse an umbrella!\nNo! Build a tunnel to go directly inside!\nNo! make a waterproof suit that covers your whole body!\nNo! Build an overpass that my taxi/bus will drop me off under!\nNo! Have a drone float above my head to prevent water from touching me.\nNo!.....\n[2 minutes pass] Time is done!\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with.\n \n5 minutes: Now let’s try “yes and”: \nYou have 2 minutes again, and this time someone says an idea, and then someone else in the group must say “yes”, and add a feature to grow the idea to make the idea bigger. Is it clear? Let's do it\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nBuild a tunnel to go directly inside from where you get dropped off!\nYes! And have heat inside to keep you warm on cold days\nYes! And the heat system is controlled by an app on your phone that you can use to control the temperature where you are walking\nYes! And …..\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with\n\n3 minutes: Review + recap\nAsk them which one did they like and why? (yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more. \nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint! We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources.

(gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!! (alone)\n Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\n Send the entrepreneurs in the other room where prototyping supplies are laid out for them.\n How might this solution fit into the context of your partner’s life? \n Improve and build out the concept you talked about\n17\n\nFEEDBACK\n20 minutes: Activity\n\n6 minutes: Feedback (3 mins each) \nRemember, your idea is not precious, feedback is just a way to learn more\nGenerate more feedback\nWrite down how they feel about it\nWatch how they use it, misuse it, what mistakes are they making, what doesn’t make sense, etc\nWrite down one new idea, one big question from feedback. Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief \nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out? \nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable? What was most natural? \nHow was it as a user interacting with the prototype? \n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nBriefly explain again how they just went through the whole design thinking process in under an hour\nExplain that during Ignite, we will go through the first 3 steps, and then the incubator we will do the last 2 steps\nWrap up for lunch\n\n19\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nAny Questions?]]]",

What time would work best for you?\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to share my process below to ensure it's clear why I'm making this workbook and how I intend to integrate it with the modules and the module content upgrades. Once I get a go-ahead on the process after Sunday, I will continue with the Accelerator priority modules.\n\nGoal: \n\nInstead of creating numerous worksheets, we aim to share climate awareness and link it to business risks, then support them to act on it. To operationalize that, we will develop business resilience through a streamlined workbook, The Business Efficiency Workbook, that is referred to throughout various Five One Labs training modules.\n\nThis approach ensures that businesses in Iraq recognize climate risks during their design thinking, marketing, and product development strategies, and it encourages them to take practical steps to improve efficiency (and therefore climate resilience) - without merely focusing on being \"Green\".\n\nDevelopment Approach:\n\nDone:\n\nRaise awareness of climate risks for businesses in Iraq. (Slides completed)\n\nIdentify priority areas for integrating climate concepts. (Completed)\n\nNext:\n\nSelect a priority module from the Ignite/Accelerator program and decide:\n\nCan climate resilience be integrated into the Efficiency Workbook? If so, integrate it.\n\nDo we need a new worksheet? If so, develop it.\n\nShould we modify the presentation? If so, modify it.\n\nImplementation Approach for Training:\n\nGuide businesses to first identify risks using the risk assessment sheet. (To be determined where / when / how often during the accelerator to review risk worksheet)\n\nMove selected actions into the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW) to:\n\nIdentify risks\n\nImprove business resilience\n\nSelect and monitor key actions\n\n\n\nImplementation Approach During Training:\n\nBusinesses assess risks first using the risk sheet (likely during the \"Pitch\" or the \"Brand\" phase of Ignite). Telling stories about risk and risk mitigation can be an important element for their pitches.\n\nRisks related to efficiency are moved into the Business Efficiency Workbook.\n\nBusinesses track actions to improve resilience and monitor impact over time (various modules directing towards workbook)\n\nLoop and repeat at various points in the accelerator to flesh out the Business Efficiency Workbook, similar to the Financial Workbook growing more robust over time.\n\nThis reduces complexity and ensures businesses see climate resilience as a smart business strategy rather than extra work.\n\n]]]\n\nAsk it to use the rubric below to assess the content and to score the slide\n\nThen ask it to generate suggestions for improvement for the slides and facilitation notes and critique it ensuring it’s streamlined, minimally invasive, yet maximally impactful.\n\nThen ask it if a worksheet might be needed. And then only if absolutely necessary let’s make a markdown version of the worksheet.\n\n\n\nBe sure to follow this approach to adapt an entrepreneurship program to be more Climate-Resilient\n\nFraming Climate Resilience as Business Resilience\n\nInstead of presenting climate adaptation as an environmental initiative, we will position it as a necessary component of modern business strategy.\n\nThis may require an additional section in the curriculum supporting this realization and opening the connection between climate and successful business strategy. Entrepreneurs will learn to:\n\nAnticipate shifts in market demand, supply chains, and consumer preferences due to rising energy costs and environmental factors.\n\nDevelop business models that remain viable in an increasingly resource-constrained world.\n\nIdentify funding and investment opportunities linked to sustainability, such as impact investing and climate adaptation grants.\n\nKey Principles of Integration\n\nEmbedded, Not Added\n\nClimate resilience is not a standalone topic—it is integrated into market research, financial planning, business model design, and operations.\n\nReal-World Examples\n\nCase studies will highlight businesses in Iraq, KRI, and internationally that have successfully adapted to climate challenges.\n\nFlexibility & Feasibility\n\nEntrepreneurs will be introduced to staged adaptation strategies, allowing them to implement small, cost-effective changes now, with a roadmap for scaling up over time.\n\nRisk Management as a Core Business Skill\n\nBusinesses will learn how to monitor environmental and economic risks and adjust their models accordingly.\n\n\n\n3.

Resilience in Incubator Curriculum vs. Green School Quality Standard: Greening Every Learning Environment\n\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen School Quality Standard Recommendations\n\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\n\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\n\nDevelop a Green School Action Plan\n\n(Clear steps, responsibilities, and monitoring for sustainability initiatives)\n\n- The proposal outlines a structured Implementation Timeline for integrating climate resilience into the incubator curriculum.\n\n- The Curriculum Integration Strategy identifies specific intervention points in the Business Model Canvas (BMC).\n\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal includes structured phases, but it lacks explicit monitoring and evaluation plans to track progress.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce a progress tracking mechanism (e.g., feedback loops, sustainability progress dashboard for businesses).\n\nMonitor and Evaluate Progress\n\n(SMART targets, periodic evaluations, and avoiding greenwashing)\n\n- The proposal includes rubric-based evaluations for assessing resilience in the curriculum.\n\n- Key Deliverables mention an assessment of 32 curriculum sessions for improvement.\n\n✅ Alignment with improvement potential – The proposal addresses evaluation, but it doesn’t mention specific key performance indicators (KPIs) or methods for tracking business adaptation over time.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Develop clear KPIs such as:\n\n- % of businesses implementing climate resilience strategies\n\n- Success rates in securing climate-linked investments\n\n- Reduction in operational costs through energy efficiency\n\nFoster Community Engagement\n\n(Sharing sustainability best practices with the broader community)\n\n- The proposal includes case studies showcasing climate-resilient businesses in Iraq and internationally.\n\n- Additional services include business resilience coaching and policy & regulatory reports.\n\n✅ Good Alignment – The proposal focuses on community learning through real-world case studies.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Encourage peer learning and networking among entrepreneurs through sustainability forums, mentorship programs, or incubator alumni engagement.\n\nImprove Facilities and Operations\n\n(Water conservation, waste management, and infrastructure improvements for climate resilience)\n\n- The proposal focuses on business operations (lean operations, energy efficiency, sustainable supply chains).\n\n✅ Alignment in a business context – While the proposal integrates climate-conscious business operations, it doesn’t explicitly address waste management or water conservation.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Include training modules on circular economy principles and green infrastructure for businesses.\n\nEnhance Teaching and Learning\n\n(Integrate sustainability across subjects, participatory learning, hands-on projects)\n\n- Climate resilience is embedded across business modules, not treated as an isolated topic.\n\n- Uses Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a practical tool for integration.\n\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum ensures climate resilience is a core business skill.\n\n➡ Enhancement: Incorporate experiential learning, such as business simulations, hands-on resilience-building exercises, and real-time problem-solving workshops.\n\nStrengthen Policy and Stakeholder Engagement\n\n(Stakeholder workshops, engagement with indigenous knowledge, advocacy training)\n\n- The proposal includes a Policy & Regulatory Landscape Report to guide entrepreneurs on compliance and future climate policies.\n\n✅ Good Alignment – Addresses policy adaptation but lacks a community advocacy component.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce policy roundtables or stakeholder dialogues for entrepreneurs to actively engage in policy discussions on climate resilience.\n\nAddress Climate Resilience and Disaster Preparedness\n\n(Emergency planning, climate risk reduction strategies)\n\n- The proposal integrates risk management as a business skill, helping businesses anticipate and mitigate climate risks.\n\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum tackles climate risks through business continuity planning.\n\n➡ Enhancement: Add disaster preparedness training (e.g., what to do in case of climate-induced supply chain disruptions or extreme weather events).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 2:\n\nClimate Resilience in Incubator Curriculum vs. GreenComp: The European Sustainability Competence Framework\n\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenComp Competence Area\n\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\n\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\n\nEmbodying Sustainability Values (Understanding ecological limits, fairness, and justice in sustainability)\n\n- Focuses on financial risk, supply chain adaptation, and business continuity.\n\n- Sustainability is framed as a business strategy, but ethical and social justice aspects are not emphasized.\n\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal integrates sustainability but does not explicitly address fairness and social justice in business models.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Expand on ethical decision-making and incorporate regenerative business models that prioritize fair trade, equity, and community impact.\n\nEmbracing Complexity in Sustainability (Systems thinking and understanding interdependencies)\n\n- Uses the Business Model Canvas (BMC) to integrate climate risks.\n\n- Focuses on business resilience but lacks a holistic understanding of sustainability interdependencies.\n\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Addresses financial and operational resilience but does not fully incorporate systems thinking.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce training on interdependencies such as energy-water-food nexus, biodiversity impact, and circular economy strategies to help entrepreneurs see sustainability beyond business profits.\n\nFutures Literacy (Anticipating long-term sustainability risks and trends)\n\n- Encourages adaptation to market shifts but does not focus on future scenario planning.\n\n- Entrepreneurs are trained to react to changes rather than anticipate and shape the future.\n\n🔶 Partial Alignment – Covers current risks but does not include foresight training for long-term climate

      "content": "Below is a **two-part response**:\n\n1. A **brief comparison** of Version 2 vs. Version 3, highlighting **pros and cons**.  \n2. A **merged “best of both” version**, integrating the strengths of each document into one cohesive process.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Comparison of Version 2 vs. Version 3**\n\n### **Version 2: Pros & Cons**\n\n**Pros**  \n- **Highly Detailed Steps**: Clearly labeled steps (1–6) with distinct prompts for each.  \n- **Central Role of Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)**: Emphasizes integrating climate resilience through the BEW, ensuring consistency across modules.  \n- **Concise Worksheets Logic**: Clearly states criteria for deciding if a new worksheet is needed.  \n- **Structured Documentation Template**: Provides a detailed template for final outputs (Module Summary, Rubric Scoring, Areas for Improvement, etc.).  \n\n**Cons**  \n- **Heavier Text**: Version 2 is longer and more text-heavy, which might feel overwhelming at first glance.  \n- **Less Emphasis on Iterative/Continuous Improvement**: The steps are clear, but iteration is only partially mentioned (in Step 6, “Document the Assessment”).  \n- **Less “At-a-Glance” Format**: Each step is well described, but the user might need to jump around to find references to local context or how the content ties into advanced expansions (case studies, advanced examples, etc.).\n\n### **Version 3: Pros & Cons**\n\n**Pros**  \n- **Lean, Modular Approach**: Each step is clearly framed with bullet points and short prompt templates.  \n- **Iterative Structure**: Mentions a step-by-step approach with a clear sense of iteration and continuous improvement.  \n- **Concise & Straightforward**: Easier to skim quickly, which can help trainers or facilitators find relevant steps.  \n- **Integration Matrix & Checklist**: Provides “common pitfalls,” “evaluation checklist,” and an “integration matrix,” which can be very handy for project management.  \n\n**Cons**  \n- **Less Detail on Documentation Format**: While it mentions doc structures, it doesn’t provide a specific “Module Summary / Areas for Improvement / Slides to Update” template.  \n- **Less Emphasis on Worksheets**: Version 3 references how to create them but doesn’t specifically mention the “Business Efficiency Workbook” as the central anchor as frequently as Version 2 does.  \n- **Less Guidance for the Assistant**: Version 3 covers the steps but is more reliant on the user to figure out how to store or log final results.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Merged “Best of Both” Version**\n\nBelow is a **unified process** that merges the best features of both versions: the **detail and documentation structure** of Version 2 plus the **modular, iterative approach and clarity** of Version 3. This single version also **centralizes the Business Efficiency Workbook** as a unifying tool and provides **checklists** and **prompt templates** in a lean yet comprehensive way.\n\n---\n\n# **LLM-Assisted Process for Integrating Climate Resilience into Five One Labs Curriculum**\n\n## **Overview**\n\nThis document describes a **module-by-module** process for using Large Language Models (LLMs) to **assess, score, and improve** the Five One Labs entrepreneurship curriculum with **climate resilience** embedded as a core **business strategy**.  \n\n**Key Principles**:  \n- **Minimally Invasive, Maximally Impactful**: Weave climate resilience into existing content rather than adding entirely separate sections.  \n- **Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)**: Use the BEW as the **central** tool for tracking, evaluating, and updating business strategies with resilience measures.  \n- **Iterative & Practical**: Each module passes through assessment, improvement, documentation, and optional re-check.\n\n---\n\n## **Process Steps (Six Phases, Iterative)**\n\n### **Step 1: Initial Module Assessment**\n\n**Goal**: Understand the module’s objectives, identify existing content that touches on efficiency or risk, and spot opportunities for climate resilience.\n\n1. **Collect Module Content**: Gather slides, facilitation notes, and any handouts.  \n2. **Use an LLM Prompt** (example below) to get a high-level summary and potential integration points.\n\n```markdown\n**Prompt**:\n\"You are an expert in curriculum design, climate resilience, and entrepreneurship. \nPlease analyze the following module content:\n\n[Paste module text/slides here]\n\n1. Summarize the module’s objectives and activities.\n2. Identify any existing references to efficiency, sustainability, or risk management.\n3. Suggest where climate resilience and sustainability concepts might fit naturally.\"\n```\n\n**Outputs**:  \n- Short summary of module content  \n- Possible integration points (e.g., eco-constraints during brainstorming, local examples in case studies)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Rubric-Based Scoring**\n\n**Goal**: Evaluate the module’s current climate resilience coverage using both **Hard Skills** (e.g., Risk Management, Sustainable Operations) and **Soft Skills** (GreenComp) on a **1–5 scale**.\n\n1. **Reference the Rubric**: Use the **Hard/Soft Skills** from your climate-resilient entrepreneurship framework.  \n2. **Prompt** the LLM to **score** each element:\n\n```markdown\n**Prompt**:\n\"Using the rubric below (1–5: Not Addressed to Advanced Integration), please score this module on:\n\n**Hard Skills**:\n1. Business Model Resilience\n2. Risk Management & Scenario Planning\n3. (…etc.)\n\n**Soft Skills (GreenComp)**:\n1. Systems Thinking\n2. Futures Literacy\n3. (…etc.)\n\nFor each element, provide:\n- Score (1–5)\n- Evidence from the module\n- Key gaps or missing points\"\n```\n\n**Outputs**:  \n- A table with **scores and justifications** for each relevant skill or competence.  \n- Snapshot of how well the module addresses climate resilience.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identify Areas for Improvement**\n\n**Goal**: Pinpoint the **specific** sections or learning activities where you can embed climate resilience without disrupting the existing flow.\n\n1. **Use the LLM** to highlight exactly **where** and **how** the module can improve.  \n2. **Leverage the Client’s Curriculum Review** clusters (e.g., Market & Business Opportunity, Product & Service Design, etc.) and local Iraqi context (water scarcity, energy costs).\n\n```markdown\n**Prompt**:\n\"Based on the scoring results, identify 3–5 key areas to improve. \nTie each area to:\n- Relevant cluster from the review (e.g. 'Operations & Supply Chain')\n- Local context (Iraq/KRI)\n- Potential link to the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)\"\n```\n\n**Outputs**:  \n- Bulleted list of **improvement areas** (e.g., “Add a climate risk lens to supply chain discussion” or “Incorporate water efficiency in prototyping”).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Suggest Minimal, Impactful Changes**\n\n**Goal**: Provide small, targeted revisions to slides, speaker notes, or exercises that integrate climate resilience naturally.\n\n1. **Prompt** the LLM for **slide-by-slide** or **section-by-section** suggestions.  \n2. Emphasize minimal text changes, short new prompts, or local case study mentions, referencing the **BEW** if appropriate.\n\n```markdown\n**Prompt**:\n\"Propose specific, minimal changes to the following slides/facilitator notes to integrate climate resilience:\n\n[Paste relevant slide text or facilitation notes]\n\nFocus on:\n1. Adding or editing 1–2 lines per slide\n2. Referencing local Iraqi examples\n3. Highlighting resource constraints or risk management\n4. Directing participants to fill out sections of the BEW where needed\"\n```\n\n**Outputs**:  \n- A **list of recommended micro-changes** (e.g., “Slide 3: Add bullet: ‘Consider local water and energy constraints in your user research plan’”).  \n- Enhanced notes for the facilitator, e.g., “Ask participants how rising energy costs might affect their target customer.”\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Determine If a Worksheet Is Needed**\n\n**Goal**: Decide whether existing templates (especially the **BEW**) suffice or if you need a new short worksheet.\n\n1. If the LLM sees an **activity** that requires entrepreneurs to do deeper reflection (risk assessment, costing, or scenario planning), it may propose a new worksheet.  \n2. If feasible, **integrate** it into the BEW to keep everything consolidated.\n\n```markdown\n**Prompt**:\n\"Do we need a new worksheet for this module? \n- If yes, please provide a minimal markdown draft with 1–2 prompts that align with the BEW.\n- If no, show how to integrate changes into the existing BEW sections.\"\n```\n\n**Outputs**:  \n- Either “No new worksheet needed—direct them to fill out the Risk Assessment page in the BEW.”  \n- Or a **simple markdown** worksheet with specific climate-related questions, referencing how it fits into the BEW.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Document & Iterate**\n\n**Goal**: Compile the final deliverables, ensuring consistency and easy reference for future updates. Then optionally re-run the updated module content through the LLM for a final check.\n\n1. **Create a short “Module Update Report”** with:\n   - **Module Summary**  \n   - **Rubric Scoring**  \n   - **Areas for Improvement**  \n   - **Implemented Changes** (slides or facilitation notes)  \n   - **Worksheet (if any)**  \n\n2. **Optionally Re-run** the new or revised content through an LLM for a **final validation**:\n\n```markdown\n**Prompt**:\n\"Review the updated slides/notes below. \nHas the climate resilience integration improved based on our goals (1–5 scale)? \nAny final tweaks needed?\"\n```\n\n3. **Log Everything** in your **Master Curriculum Tracker** (spreadsheet or table). Record:\n   - **Date of assessment**  \n   - **Scores before & after**  \n   - **Changes made**  \n   - **Future to-dos**  \n\n---\n\n## **Supporting Elements**\n\n### **Documentation Template**\n\nUse a consistent format for each module:\n\n```markdown\n## Module: [Module Name]\n\n**1.

This document merges previous references in a **simplified** but **comprehensive** way.\n\n---\n\n# **FIVE ONE LABS: CLIMATE-RESILIENT CURRICULUM UPDATE PROCESS**\n\n## **I. Introduction & Key Principles**\n\n1. **Embedded, Not Added**  \n   We frame **climate resilience** as **business resilience**—an essential aspect of modern entrepreneurship in Iraq/KRI. It is **not** an extra environmental step but rather a **core risk management** and **business efficiency** measure.\n\n2. **Real-World Examples**  \n   Use **case studies** highlighting Iraqi/KRI businesses that have **adapted** to local climate challenges (e.g., energy costs, water scarcity). This makes sustainability **relevant** and **actionable** for participants.\n\n3. **Flexibility & Feasibility**  \n   Introduce **staged adaptation** strategies: **small, cost-effective** changes now, a **roadmap** for scaling over time.\n\n4. **Risk Management as Core Business Skill**  \n   Monitor **environmental and economic risks**, adjusting the model accordingly. This is especially relevant in contexts like the KRI with **inconsistent electricity** and potential **water shortages**.\n\n5. **ILO Green Business Booklet & GreenComp**  \n   We reference:  \n   - **ILO Green Business Booklet** (for greening processes, supply chain, and product design).  \n   - **GreenComp** (European Sustainability Competence Framework) for soft skills like **systems thinking** and **futures literacy**.\n\n6. **Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)**  \n   The **BEW** is a **central living document** used throughout the program. At key points, participants fill in resource use, potential climate risks, and adaptation actions. We add or modify **worksheets** only if needed.\n\n---\n\n## **II. The Four-Stage Process**\n\nWe have **fewer** (4) major stages, each with a **single, detailed prompt** to run in an LLM.

Build a tunnel to go directly inside!\nNo! make a waterproof suit that covers your whole body!\nNo! Build an overpass that my taxi/bus will drop me off under!\nNo! Have a drone float above my head to prevent water from touching me.\nNo!.....\n[2 minutes pass] Time is done!\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with.\n \n5 minutes: Now let’s try “yes and”: \nYou have 2 minutes again, and this time someone says an idea, and then someone else in the group must say “yes”, and add a feature to grow the idea to make the idea bigger. Is it clear? Let's do it\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nBuild a tunnel to go directly inside from where you get dropped off!\nYes! And have heat inside to keep you warm on cold days\nYes! And the heat system is controlled by an app on your phone that you can use to control the temperature where you are walking\nYes! And …..\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with\n\n3 minutes: Review + recap\nAsk them which one did they like and why? (yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more. \nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint!

(gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part?

The core learning objectives are:\n\nUnderstanding the design thinking process and its application in problem-solving\nConducting user research to identify real customer needs\nIdeating, prototyping, and iterating on solutions\nKey activities include icebreakers, a design sprint, user research, brainstorming, and rapid prototyping. Participants engage in a hands-on one-hour design thinking exercise, which simulates the full process. Current outcomes emphasize increased creativity, problem-framing skills, and iterative design approaches, but lack explicit climate resilience components.\n\nTask 2: Climate Integration Analysis\nLocation\tCurrent Activity\tSuggested Change\tLocal Context & Reasoning\nSlide 4 - Design Sprint Introduction\tIntroduction to design thinking and the sprint process\tIntroduce climate-conscious design thinking, emphasizing how sustainable solutions are a part of problem-solving.\tIraq/KRI faces severe climate stress, including rising temperatures, water scarcity, and desertification. Embedding climate resilience in design solutions ensures that businesses are future-proof.\nSlide 7 - What is Design Thinking?\tDiscusses the role of design thinking in problem-solving and innovation\tAdd climate-focused case studies (e.g., designing businesses that minimize waste, use renewable energy, or adapt to extreme weather)\tEntrepreneurs in Iraq/KRI need to integrate sustainability early to navigate climate challenges and remain competitive in green markets.\nSlide 9 - Define a Clear Problem\tEncourages defining customer needs using verbs, not just nouns\tAdd a climate-resilience example: Instead of \"we need more electricity,\" reframe as \"we need to reduce energy waste.\"\tMany regions in Iraq suffer from energy crises and inefficient resource use—businesses can innovate by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and increasing efficiency.\nSlide 12 - Interview Activity\tParticipants interview their partners about morning routines\tAdd an environmental behavior component: Ask how participants' routines impact climate (e.g., energy use, transportation choices, waste).\tMany small businesses and households in Iraq rely on inefficient energy consumption and high plastic use—raising awareness can shift habits.\nSlide 15 - Brainstorming\tGenerating 5+ solutions to a partner’s problem\tIntroduce a climate constraint: What if the solution must be made from recycled or locally sourced materials? How can the business idea minimize waste?\tIraq has a waste management crisis—entrepreneurs should design with sustainability in mind from the outset.\nSlide 16 - Prototype Activity\tParticipants build a prototype using diverse materials\tEnsure that materials available for prototyping include eco-friendly, biodegradable, or upcycled options.\tThis encourages an early resource-conscious mindset—Iraq’s infrastructure cannot handle excessive industrial waste.\nSlide 17 - Feedback\tParticipants test prototypes and gather feedback\tAdd a climate-conscious reflection question: Could your solution work with fewer resources or less environmental impact?\tBusinesses that prioritize sustainability have a market advantage, especially as Iraq explores renewable energy initiatives.\nSlide 18 - Wrap-up\tReview of the design thinking process\tConclude by emphasizing that innovation includes resilience—climate change will define future market needs, and businesses should adapt proactively.\tClimate adaptation is not optional—entrepreneurs who consider sustainability early will outlast those who don’t.\nFinal Recommendations\nExplicit Climate Framing\n\nIntroduce sustainability as a design principle at the start.\nUse local examples (e.g., businesses tackling water scarcity, extreme heat solutions, waste reduction).\nClimate-Conscious Brainstorming & Prototyping\n\nAdd eco-constraints during ideation (e.g., \"How would this work in a low-water environment?\").\nEnsure green materials are available for prototyping.\nBusiness Model Resilience\n\nEncourage participants to future-proof their ideas by considering climate risks and market demands for sustainability.\nBy embedding climate resilience into design thinking, this module can prepare Iraqi entrepreneurs to build businesses that thrive in an uncertain future. 🚀\n\n11:40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nStage 2: Module Scoring Prompt\nINSTRUCTIONS\nYou are a curriculum consultant specializing in integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training.

This final section consolidates the process so it can be **operationalized** easily.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Approach Review**\n\nYou used a **multi-step, prompt-driven** process to:\n1. **Provide the LLM with a structured request** (tasks and tables)  \n2. **Paste raw module content** from the Design Thinking slides  \n3. **Have the LLM analyze and propose changes** focused on embedding climate resilience  \n4. **Iteratively refine** the output with scoring, suggested content changes, and resource needs  \n\n### **What Went Well**\n- **Clear Task Segmentation**: Breaking the process into discrete tasks (Module Summary, Climate Integration Analysis, Scoring, Implementation Plan) helped the LLM respond systematically.\n- **Concrete Output Tables**: Each table (Content Changes, Activity Modifications, Resource Needs) provided **actionable recommendations** at a glance.\n- **Minimal Disruption**: The recommended changes—like adjusting slide text or adding a short worksheet—kept the original curriculum mostly intact.\n- **Local Context**: The approach prompts the LLM to incorporate Iraqi/KRI-specific examples, ensuring **relevance and authenticity**.\n\n### **What Didn’t Go Well**\n- **Multiple Large Prompts**: Because each stage required different information, you had to **re-feed** large chunks of text multiple times.\n- **Risk of Overlap**: Some suggestions repeated across tasks, requiring manual curation to avoid duplication (e.g., the same concept repeated in “Content Changes” and “Activity Modifications”).\n- **No Single Master Prompt**: The approach had separate prompts for each stage rather than a single, consolidated prompt referencing the entire flow. This was workable but could be streamlined.\n- **Reliance on Facilitator Discretion**: Some suggestions (like “use local materials”) are easy to overlook if the facilitator doesn’t consistently apply them.\n\n---\n\n## **2.

Provide a structured analysis with two main tasks.\n\n---\n### Task 1: Module Summary\nGive a **2-3 sentence summary** focusing on:\n- Core learning objectives\n- Key activities\n- Current participant outcomes\n*(Emphasize any existing references to climate resilience or efficiency if present.)*\n\n### Task 2: Climate Integration Analysis\nCreate a table analyzing opportunities to integrate climate resilience. Use **this format**:\n\n| Location                 | Current Activity                                        | Suggested Change                                                                | Local Context & Reasoning                                                    |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [Slide/section number]   | [Brief description of existing activity/content]       | [Specific, actionable change to implement]                                      | [Why this matters for Iraq/KRI + business impact]                            |\n\n**Guidelines**:\n- **Location**: Be specific (slide number, page, or time stamp)\n- **Current Activity**: Focus on what participants actually do\n- **Suggested Change**: Must be concrete and implementable (1-2 sentences)\n- **Local Context & Reasoning**: Connect to specific Iraq/KRI challenges and how it benefits local businesses\n\n---\n## Module Content\n[PASTE YOUR MODULE TEXT OR SLIDES HERE]\n\n---\n\n### **Where to Paste Content**\n1. **Locate** your raw slides or facilitator notes in a digital format (e.g., plain text or copy-paste from PowerPoint).\n2. **Replace** the placeholder `[PASTE YOUR MODULE TEXT OR SLIDES HERE]` in the prompt with your module’s actual content.\n3. **Submit** this entire prompt (with module text appended) to your LLM of choice (e.g., ChatGPT).\n\n### **How to Return the Output**\n- The LLM will **generate** two sections: a **2-3 sentence summary** and a **climate integration table**. \n- Copy or export that output into a **document** (e.g., Word, Google Doc, Notion) for easy reference. \n- Use the results to update or annotate your slides, or proceed to a next step (like scoring or creating an implementation plan) with a **follow-up prompt**.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Final Notes for Operational Use**\n- **Streamline** by creating a single “master prompt” for each stage (Summary, Scoring, Improvement Plan) if you want a **one-and-done** approach.\n- **Iterate** if needed: \n  1. Start with the summary & table (using the prompt above).  \n  2. Ask the LLM to **score** those changes or propose new slides (via a second prompt).  \n  3. If relevant, request a short worksheet in **markdown** format.\n- **Consolidate** feedback into your “Master Curriculum Tracker” so that each module’s changes are recorded in one place.\n\nBy following this approach, you’ll ensure a **repeatable** and **operational** method for embedding climate resilience across all your entrepreneurship training modules.",

      "content": "Your **Greening Entrepreneurship Modules** process is **structured, systematic, and operationalizable**. Here’s my **evaluation** of what works well and potential refinements to make it even stronger.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **What Works Well**\n### **1. Clear, Repeatable Process**\n- The **step-by-step format** ensures consistency across modules.\n- Each **stage builds on the previous one**, reducing redundancy.\n\n### **2. Effective Use of LLMs**\n- **Stage 1** ensures the LLM captures the **current state** before suggesting changes.\n- **Stage 2** adds **scoring** to **prioritize** what matters most.\n- **Stage 3** provides a **structured implementation plan**.\n\n### **3. Structured & Actionable Outputs**\n- **Tables make it easy to extract actionable insights**.\n- **Minimal disruption**: Keeps changes **targeted and efficient** rather than rewriting everything.\n\n### **4. Adaptability**\n- **Scoring adjusts based on relevance** (only scoring applicable skills).\n- Allows facilitators to **prioritize efforts** (low, medium, high priority).\n\n### **5. Local Context Consideration**\n- Requires the LLM to **connect changes to Iraq/KRI** realities, ensuring **practicality**.\n\n---\n\n## ❌ **Areas for Improvement**\n### **1. Stage 1: More Specific Guidance for the LLM**\n- Right now, **Task 1 (Summary)** is open-ended. **Consider prompting the LLM to:**\n  - Identify **any existing sustainability mentions** (if present).\n  - Highlight **entrepreneurial decision-making areas** where climate risk might be a concern.\n\n✅ **Refinement:**\n> **Modify Task 1** to:\n> - Identify **explicit** or **implicit** mentions of sustainability or efficiency.\n> - List **2-3 areas where entrepreneurs make decisions** that could be linked to sustainability.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Stage 2: Prioritization Could Be More Nuanced**\n- **Scoring scale (1-5) works well**, but the **priority ranking (High/Medium/Low) lacks granularity**.\n- Right now, **\"Easy to implement\"** is mixed in with **\"Core to module\"**—these should be **separate**.\n\n✅ **Refinement:**\n> Add a **\"Feasibility Score\"**:\n> - **Feasibility: High** (Quick changes, e.g., adding a prompt)\n> - **Feasibility: Medium** (Moderate effort, e.g., modifying activities)\n> - **Feasibility: Low** (Larger effort, e.g., developing new training material)\n\n---\n\n### **3. Stage 3: Ensure Implementation Details Are Usable**\n- Right now, **the tables provide excellent structure**, but **facilitators might struggle** without additional guidance.\n- **The \"Implementation Notes\" column is vague**—what exactly should facilitators do?\n\n✅ **Refinement:**\n> Add a **\"Facilitator Action\"** column:\n> - Describe **exactly** what needs to be done (e.g., \"Add this discussion question after Slide 7\").\n> - Highlight **required materials** (e.g., \"Use local case study X\").\n> - Mention **estimated time impact** (e.g., \"This adds 2 minutes to the session\").\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 **Final Version with Refinements Integrated**\nThis version **fixes gaps while keeping it structured**.\n\n### **Stage 1: Initial Analysis**\n**Purpose:** Identify existing content and opportunities for climate integration.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Copy everything between the **=== markers**.\n- Replace `[MODULE_NAME]` with your module name.\n- Replace `[MODULE_CONTENT]` with your full module content.\n- Run in your LLM.\n\n```markdown\n=== STAGE 1 PROMPT ===\nYou are a curriculum consultant specializing in integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training in Iraq/KRI.
