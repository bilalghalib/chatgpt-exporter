I hope you guys got a chance to talk and get\nto know each other a little bit better.\nNow, for the rest of the day, we are going to go into the first step of Design Thinking,\nUser research.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES\nLearn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs.\n\nBuild a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology.\nUnderstand how to organize your user research data to find trends.\n1 minute: Objectives\nLearn how to develop a product that fits customers’ needs: We will show you why user\nresearch is so important and how it is essential for developing any product or service.\nBuild a research plan through the Do, Look, Listen methodology: Next, we will talk about\nbuilding a research plan. This month is all about understanding your customers needs.\nWe will do that in 3 ways, experiencing what our customers experience, observing them,\nand listening to them.\nUnderstand how to organize your user research data to find trends: Finally, we will spend\nsome time on how you should organize your research as you implement your research\nplan.\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Discussion\nDesign Thinking review\nSO, LET’S REVIEW! This morning we talked about design thinking and we ran through a\ndesign sprint so you can experience the whole process in just about 1 hour! Can\nsomeone tell us what we have learned? What is Design thinking? Why is it one of the\nmost important tools for entrepreneurs? What is it used for?\nSome possible answers:\nAllows for creative solutions to problems by defining needs as verbs!\nWe get to know our customers (who they are, where they are, how they behave, what\nthey like/dislike, etc…)\nEmpathize with them\nSome people might mention a few (or all) of the steps\nCreate better products by ensuring that it is designed to meet their needs\nGo over the design thinking process briefly touching on points the entrepreneurs missed.\nRemind them that it is a continuous process that needs to be tested and re-evaluated\nagain and again.\n\n4\nMINDSETS\n5 minutes: Discussion\nMindsets: Facilitate a discussion on what mindsets we should have going into the\nprogram. Write everyone's answer on the board and see where people are at. At the\nend, put these points up on the boards and say that in design thinking, there are a few\nadditional mindsets that are really important to have. Point out if they have already said\nany of them. We operate from these mindsets:\nFocus on human values: Design thinking is human centered design. We look to\nunderstand the needs and emotions of people in order to design solutions for them.\nEmpathy for the people you are designing for and feedback from these\nusers is fundamental to good design\nShow don’t tell: Wherever you can, show people what you are doing, don’t explain it to\nthem. You learn more from listening and observing real reactions, than having people\nrespond to your talking. This is essential when we get to prototyping. Communicate your\nvision in an impactful and meaningful way by creating experiences, using illustrative\nvisuals, and telling good stories.\nEmbrace experimentation: Don’t be afraid to try things. It is ok to fail, in fact, it can be\ngood! The more you experiment and allow yourself to consider different options, the\nmore you will learn and you will get better. Prototyping is not simply a way to validate\nyour idea; it is an integral part of your innovation process. We build to think and learn.\nBe mindful of the process: Know where you are in the design process, what methods to\nuse in that stage, and what your goals are. It is a process for a reason, don’t skip a step,\nbut don’t be afraid to go back if you need more research or to reframe the problem to\nfind better solutions!\nBias towards action: Design thinking is very hands on and action oriented. There will not\nbe a lot of time sitting and learning, we want you to experience everything by doing!\nDesign thinking is a misnomer; it is more about doing that thinking. Bias toward doing\nand making over thinking and meeting.\nRadical collaboration: In order to get a diversity of ideas and solutions, you have to\ncollaborate. In this room there are so many people with different backgrounds and\nexperiences. Use each other to brainstorm and develop your businesses. Later on, you\nwill even collaborate with your customers or anyone else who would interact with your\nproduct/service. Bring together innovators with varied backgrounds and viewpoints.\nEnable breakthrough insights and solutions to emerge from the diversity.\nCraft clarity: Things are going to get messy. That is normal, take care to reframe the\nproblem to make it clear. Produce a coherent vision out of messy problems. Frame it in a\nway to inspire others and to fuel ideation.\nUSER RESEARCH\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nEmpathizing is the first step we will look at in the Design Thinking process. We will\nempathize with our users through user research. It is the phase where you learn about\nyour customers behaviors, needs, pains, and gains.\nAsk: Why is the user research phase of Design Thinking so important?\nUser research helps us to understand how people go about performing tasks and\nachieving goals that are important to them.\nIt gives us context and perspective and puts us in a position to respond with useful,\nsimplified, and productive design solutions.\nUser research focuses on understanding user expectations, behaviors, needs, and\nmotivations through methodical, investigative approaches.\nIt helps us identify unarticulated needs and to fill in any gaps in our knowledge about our\nusers, context of use, challenges, and opportunities.\nIt also helps us to align our product and business strategy with the core needs and goals\nof our users.\nInsights are then used to ensure that all product design decisions do benefit the user.\nWHO IS YOUR USER?\nGOALS\nNEEDS\nPAINS\nWANTS\nDESIRES\n20 minutes: Discussion\n5- 10 minutes: Guided discussion on user personas. Who is your user?\nI’m sure by now, you guys already have an idea of who your customers are. We are\ngoing to spend some time taking a look at who we think are our customers at this point.\nLet’s take an example from the room. ___(name person in the room)____, can you tell\nme a little bit about one of your potential customers? Lets look at this as if they were a\nreal person. Tell me the person’s name, where they are from, and what do they love to\ndo.\nGuide the person to fill out all of the components of a user persona (shown on the next\nslide). Make sure you are writing what they say on the board in a way that will draw out\nthe user persona as depicted in the next slides.\nContent could include:\nGeographic: Location, city, reach, country, international vs local\nDemographic: Age, gender, family size, income, ethnic background\nBehavioral: Patterns, usage rates,\nPsychographic: Social class, lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes,\nGoals: What is this person trying to accomplish?\nCustomer pains: What challenges does this person face? What are the big and small\nproblems they have and how does it affect their lives?\n\nTell this person’s story: Tell a short story about this person trying to accomplish their goal\n(related to your business). What challenges do they face on their journey?\nIn market segmentation, you can be general. It is a good way to summarize large groups\nof your customers. However, in this case with personas, we want to make it as real as\npossible so we will use very specific information.\n*** If you do not feel comfortable facilitating the discussion with a new business idea,\nlearn what is on the example on the hidden slides and create a user persona around that\n(it is for a tourism business). Still make sure to engage the audience by asking them to\ntalk about a potential customer for the tourism business you are creating.\n10 minutes: Activity\nEveryone should now fill out a user persona for their business. We want you to be really\nspecific. Find an example of a real person who might use your product/service. Describe\nthem like they are real. Your customers will be real people with needs, values, and\nfeelings.\nAsk 1-2 people to share their persona they have created.\nDebrief: You guys all did a great job here. Actually, what you just did was create a “fake”\nuser persona. I think a lot of these points might be accurate; however, we are assuming\nthat these are accurate. This is just based on who we THINK is our user, and it is not\nreally based on much data. Over the next few weeks, we are going to spend some time\ndoing intensive user research and come up with accurate user personas by collecting\nboth qualitative and quantitative data.\nPICTURE & NAME\nDEMOGRAPHIC:\nShe is 22 years old,\nSingle,\nStudies international cultures,\nWorks as a waitress.\nGEOGRAPHIC:\nChristie is living in a small apartment in New York\nHas a strong online presence and spends 3-4 hours on social media every day.\nBEHAVIORAL:\nShe likes to try new things\nShe eats out at restaurants on a weekly basis\nShe uses her phone to research user reviews to help her decide what to do and buy\nTravels every summer with her family to the mountains\nPSYCHOGRAPHIC:\nVegan & animal rights activist\n\nDoesn’t care about her looks, always dresses down\nLoves adventure\nAlternative example (slides 7-8)\n5- 10 minutes: Brainstorm\nGuided discussion on user personas.

She is 22 years old, single, studies\ninternational cultures, and works as a waitress. She dreams of a future where she can\ncombine work and travel. She wants to work in work in a company where she can travel\n\nand make a difference in the world. She’s not sure about having kids and a husband. At\nleast it’s not on her radar just yet.\nTravel internationally in a sustainable way\nSee the world\nHelp others\nSave money\nTraveling is too expensive\nShe doesn’t know where to look for sustainable tourism options\nIt is really hard for her to keep track of prices, hotel options, and day trips she is\nreviewing\n9\nBREAK\nYOUR RESEARCH:\nDO\nLOOK\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\nYour research plan: Welcome back from your break. I hope you are feeling re-energized!\nSo, as we said before, we all have an idea of who our customers are and what they\nwant, but really, these are just assumptions. We might be right on some things, but we\nprobably don’t have the whole picture. That’s why it is so important to create a research\nplan. To help us fill these gaps and give us more insights on what our customers need!\nHow will we do this? Through three research methodologies: Do, Look, and Listen.\nDo is all about experiential learning. Putting yourself in the shoes of your customers.\nLook is learning through observation. Trying to see the behaviors of your customers to\npinpoint needs and opportunities.\nListen is where we talk to our customers through user interviews. Here we hear from\nthem and try to get to the root of their problems and really understand their behaviors\nand emotions.\nDO\nhttps://www.cleancookingalliance.org/binary-data/RESOURCE/file/000/000/407-1.pdf\n20 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\nDO is all about experiencing what your customers experience. In order to understand the\npains of your customers, you have to go through the process yourself. For the DO, tell\nthe story of one of IDEO's engineers:\nIDEO is one of the leading companies in product development focusing on design\nthinking methodology. IDEO was working on creating a new design for a stove in a third\nworld country. They wanted to design a solution for women to make cooking easier for\nthem. So what did they do? They went to the country and used the stove. They\nexperienced how people cooked every day and got to feel how those women felt using\nthat stove. The lesson in this story is that even if you are an expert, you have to go\nthrough the same experience of your users to feel their challenges!\n15 minutes: Activity - Immerse (DO)\nHave participants partner up\nGive each pair a task:\nGo into the bathroom and wash your hands,\nWalk around the space, get a book, and put it on the table in the kitchen,\nMake a cup of tea\nDo a lap around the space\nGet a piece of paper and write directions to the bathroom\nYou can do anything, be creative!\nOne participant will close their eyes and try to complete the task, while their partner\nguides them and makes sure they don’t run into things or hurt themselves\nThen switch so that both people go through the process\nDEBRIEF: How was that experience? What did it make you learn? How do you think it\nwould be to be blind in a space like this?\nNow think, if you were to design a product for someone who was blind, what are some\nthings you would include? Think about what helped you accomplish the task. Was it\nuseful to hold onto things? Were sounds helpful? Did you like it when someone was in\nfront of you? What were things that frustrated you while you were “blind“, how could that\nbe fixed?\nLESSON: It is important to walk in your customers shoes, especially if you are\ndeveloping a product for them. To see life from their perspective will allow you to truly\nunderstand them and their needs\nWhat are they doing?\nHow are they doing it?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?\nLOOK\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nAnother form of research is observation. You can learn so much by just observing people\nin their natural routine. While you are watching, take note of a few things:\nWhat are they doing? What are their actual behaviors? List them step by step. Be detail\noriented.\nHow are they doing it? Are they doing something a little odd that needs further\nexplanation? Is it easy for them? Difficult?\nWhy do you think they are doing that? What are they trying to accomplish? What is the\nend goal?\n10 minutes: Activity\nObserve (LOOK): What is this a picture of? What do you see?\nSpend 5-10 minutes getting thoughts from people. Take the time to build up a story\nabout this person.\nWrite everyone's thoughts on the board\nRemember to touch on the previous slides questions (what, how, why)\nWhat do you see versus what do you think based on what you see?\nLESSON: You can learn so much from just looking, taking a step back and trying to\nfigure out what you’re seeing, what you can learn from watching. Keep in mind that you\ncan only learn some things. You can see their actual behaviors. You can observe body\nlanguage and make assumptions about WHY they are doing it that way. If you can, get\nsome clarification and speak to the person to understand why they did it in that way.\nAsk for stories\nTalk about emotions\nAsk why?\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\nThe last research method we are going to cover is the User Interview. In a user\ninterview, you spend 2-30 minutes to speak with customers to hear from them about their\nexperiences. If you take the time to speak to customers, they will tell you everything you\nwould ever need to know about how to make a great product for them. They will tell you\nwhat they like and don’t like, the challenges they have with existing solutions and even\nmore! You just have to listen!\n“Tell me about the last time you…”\n“What was the best/ worse...”\n“Why is that?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\n\nLISTEN\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nBe careful how you phrase questions. It is important that you don’t lead your customers\ninto saying what you want to hear. By doing this, your interview data will be useless. To\ngive you some example of bad interview questions:\nDo you like my idea? People tend to be nice, chances are nobody would want you to feel\nbad and tell you that you have a bad idea. By asking this, you invite people to say “yes, I\nlike your idea” even though it might not be true.\nWould you buy this product? This is another question that is tricky and usually provides\nyou with false information. Again many people would be tempted to say “yes” or\n“probably” to this question. The best way to test if people are willing to buy a product is\nto see if they actually take out their wallet and try.\nDo you have trouble with _____? By posing challenges for them, you are putting words\nin their mouth. Maybe they do have trouble with that, but you want to hear it from them.\nMaybe they are facing the challenge differently than you are. Allow them to share their\nthoughts on their own. Don’t tell or suggest to people how they feel or behave.\nCan you tell me how you normally ….. This question is ALMOST good; however, it is too\ngeneral. You don’t get any real information. If you ask for generalities (‘what is your\nnormal evening like?’) then you’ll get a false picture, it will be their ‘idealized’ evening.\nYou need to ask a question that allows people to give you a specific story that has real\nemotions.\nSo what are good questions to ask? The questions ask for stories, evoke emotions, and\ngo deeper into their actual behaviors.\n“Tell me about the last time you…” By asking this question, you are able to get very\nspecific information. They will have details about what they liked and didnt like, there\nmight be a timeline, etc... You will get very rich information with this question.\n“What was the best/ worse...” By asking these questions, you are learning more about\nwhat the person likes and doesn’t. As you develop your product, it is important to know\nwhat your customers care about and what their problems are.\n“Why is that?” and “Can you tell me more?” These questions are great for going deeper.\nIf your interviewee says something surprising or interesting, you should want to know\nmore about it. Don’t assume anything, ask them about their thoughts.\nAsk why 5 times – keep asking why so that you get to the deeper meaning and emotion\nbehind decisions. Humans make decisions based on emotion, it’s important for you to\nunderstand why your users/ customers make their decisions\nINTERVIEW\nIntroduce yourself\nIntroduce project\nBuild rapport\n\nEvoke stories\nExplore emotions\nQuestion statements\nThank you & wrap up\nTime\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + example\nExplain all the steps that go into an interview. Here are some tips on what to ask in the\nbeginning, in the middle, and at the end of a user interview:\nBeginning: In the beginning of the interview, you should ask opening questions to set\npeople at ease and build rapport. You should not ask about sensitive topics. Instead,\nfocus on setting the stage and bringing your interviewees on board so they’re\ncomfortable enough to be, and remain, open with you. What you do at this stage can\ninclude the following:\nTelling participants what topics will be covered\nTelling participants how their data will be used\nAsking innocuous questions such as what their role is in their organization\nAsking concrete questions that are easy to answer\nMiddle: In the middle of the interview, you’re hitting high gear. Having established a\ndirect channel with your interviewees (the users), you move on and ask the bulk of your\nquestions, but maybe not in the order you had originally planned. Remember to:\nKeep the flow of the conversation as natural as possible, but cover the topics you want\nto cover.\nPick up on what participants have said earlier and get full replies to questions they have\nonly partially answered.\nSteer participants back on track if they go too far off topic.\nShow that you have been listening.\nGo deeper where necessary\nEnd: At the end of the interview, you wrap up in a way that makes participants feel as\nthough they have said what they wanted to say and that their answers are valuable. By\nthis point, you will have managed to tie up any loose ends on matters that had not been\nclear before, and both you and they should be satisfied that the interview has brought all\nthe issues out into the open. Things you should do include:\nAsking if there is anything participants would like to add.\nTelling your participants what you are going to do with their data and what the value is\nfor them.\nThanking them for taking the time to help with your research. Above all, remember to\nconduct a pilot study before you start approaching real-life participants and tackling\n‘organic’ interview settings. Also, always be sensitive to the fact that people are different\nand need different things!\n\n5 minutes: Example\nHave 2 trainers go through a User Interview. Show a good user interview and a bad one.\nEMPATHY MAP\n8 minutes: Brainstorm\nSo after your interview, you should reflect on and reorganize your information. We will do\nthis through an empathy map.\nAfter you give the explanation of the empathy map, fill it in for the practice interview you\njust had in front of the group (with the trainers). Have it be a conversation and write out\nthe answers as a group on the white board. As you discuss together, highlight some\ninformation about each quadrant (no need to explain each point in detail!)\nThe Says quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or some other\nusability study. Ideally, it contains verbatim and direct quotes from research.\n“I love Asiacell because I never have a bad experience.”\n“I want something reliable.”\n“I don’t understand what to do from here.”\nThe Thinks quadrant captures what the user is thinking throughout the experience. Ask\nyourself (from the qualitative research gathered): what occupies the user’s thoughts?\nWhat matters to the user? Pay special attention to what users think, but may not be\nwilling to vocalize. Try to understand why they are reluctant to share — are they unsure,\nself-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something?\n“This is really annoying.”\n“Am I dumb for not understanding this?”\nThe Does quadrant encloses the actions the user takes. From the research, what does\nthe user physically do? How does the user go about doing it?\nRefreshes page several times.\nShops around to compare prices.\nThe Feels quadrant is the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective plus\na short sentence for context. Ask yourself: what worries the user? What does the user\nget excited about? How does the user feel about the experience?\nImpatient: pages load too slowly\nConfused: too many contradictory prices\nWorried: they are doing something wrong\nYou might encounter inconsistencies — for example, seemingly positive actions but\nnegative quotes or emotions coming from the same user. This is when empathy maps\nbecome treasure maps that can uncover nuggets of understanding about our user. It is\nour job as UX professionals to investigate the cause of the conflict and resolve it.\nSome of these quadrants may seem ambiguous or overlapping — for example, it may be\ndifficult to distinguish between Thinks and Feels. Do not focus too much on being\n\nprecise: if an item may fit into multiple quadrants, just pick one. The 4 quadrants exist\nonly to push our knowledge about users and to ensure we don’t leave out any important\ndimension. (If you don’t have anything to put into a certain quadrant, it’s a strong signal\nthat you need more user research before proceeding in the design process.)\n**This is important to do together because we consistently have trouble with the\nentrepreneurs not understanding how to use the empathy map.\nPRACTICE\n20 minutes: Activity\nInterview Your Users (LISTEN)\n5 minutes: prepare questions\nCome up with 3-5 questions you want to learn from your customers about their lives/\nabout your product (5 minutes)\n10 minutes: 2 rounds of interviews (5 minutes each)\nEach person is matched with a partner\n5 minutes: Plot info on an empathy map\nAsk them to plot results on the empathy map right after the interview. This is a great way\nto re-think the interview and reflect.\nEXTREME USER\n5 minutes: Lecture\nWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users. Who are the\npeople who use this product every day?\nFor example, if you are making a new cleat, you definitely want to talk to people who\nplay sports (kids, parents who buy them, university students, etc…), but you would\nprobably want to talk to people who LIVE in cleats too. Take professional athletes for\nexample, they know every part of their shoes because they wear them for hours every\nday. They know about what they love and hate about them.\nLet’s take another example. If we were designing a new type of seat in a car, who would\nthe extreme user be? --- allow them to answer. Taxi drivers live in their cars. All day long\nthey are sitting in the seats and probably know really specific details of what makes them\ncomfortable or not. They might even share ideas on how it could be better.\nWhile creating your user research plan, make sure to include extreme users!\nYou will want to include at least 1-2 extreme users into your research plan.\n\n------------------------------------\nNotes about Extreme Users to help facilitate discussion, no need to explain them all:\nWhen considering the user's needs in design, it’s very easy for a designer to fall into the\ntrap of designing for the first, average user they can think of.\nOnly by understanding the viewpoints of a full range of people is it possible to avoid the\npitfall of designing for yourself.\nThrough speaking to the extreme users and identifying their amplified needs, it can help\npull out more meaningful insights and thus gives the potential to push ideas in different\ndirections that you wouldn’t have previously explored.\nThis group of users can help spark creativity by introducing you to hacks and use cases\nyou wouldn’t have imagined.\nIn the hope of trying to please the mainstream, which is still a very diverse group, it’s all\ntoo easy to end up designing something generic and easy to replicate.\nAn idea that suits an extreme user is more likely to please the mainstream users too.\nBy focusing on the extremes, you can find the highest priority issues. Most commonly,\nthe high priority issue is what motivates people to buy this thing, and what is keeping\nthem from buying this thing?\nExtreme user's are most in-tune with their needs, emotions and behaviors when using a\nproduct or service and can, therefore, articulate needs/challenges better.\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user.\nAsking the user to design for you.\nAsking the user to respond to your idea.\nUSER RESEARCH IS NOT:\n3 minutes: Remember!\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user.\nRemember you want to make sure they are talking, not you!\nDon’t assume things, allow them to share their own experiences\nAsking the user to design for you\nDon’t ask your interviewer what they think the solution is\nDon’t have them list features\nYOU are the designer! You need to gather information from people to create the solution\nthat will best fit their needs. By asking others to design for you, you stunt your creativity\nand can come up with generic solutions.\nAsking the user to respond to your idea\nAvoid asking the user if they like your idea. Any person will just say “yes, I like it” or “yes,\nI will use/buy this”\n\nIn general, people are polite, so you shouldn’t trust what they say in that way. Make sure\nthe questions are framed in a way where you are just focusing on the challenges they\nare facing and learning about how they are currently dealing with them.\nYou should NOT give an explanation of your idea in a user interview.\n3 places to immerse\n30 people to interview\n5 extreme users\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\nSpend the rest of the session writing your user research questions and practicing with\nother people in the cohort (we will also do this tomorrow morning)\nPractice your user research on at least 5 members of the cohort\nGive each other feedback on their interview style.

This month is all about understanding your customers needs.\nWe will do that in 3 ways, experiencing what our customers experience, observing them,\nand listening to them.\nUnderstand how to organize your user research data to find trends: Finally, we will spend\nsome time on how you should organize your research as you implement your research\nplan.\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Discussion\nDesign Thinking review\nSO, LET’S REVIEW! This morning we talked about design thinking and we ran through a\ndesign sprint so you can experience the whole process in just about 1 hour! Can\nsomeone tell us what we have learned? What is Design thinking? Why is it one of the\nmost important tools for entrepreneurs? What is it used for?\nSome possible answers:\nAllows for creative solutions to problems by defining needs as verbs!\nWe get to know our customers (who they are, where they are, how they behave, what\nthey like/dislike, etc…)\nEmpathize with them\nSome people might mention a few (or all) of the steps\nCreate better products by ensuring that it is designed to meet their needs\nGo over the design thinking process briefly touching on points the entrepreneurs missed.\nRemind them that it is a continuous process that needs to be tested and re-evaluated\nagain and again.\n4\nMINDSETS\n5 minutes: Discussion\nMindsets: Facilitate a discussion on what mindsets we should have going into the\nprogram. Write everyone's answer on the board and see where people are at. At the\nend, put these points up on the boards and say that in design thinking, there are a few\n\nadditional mindsets that are really important to have. Point out if they have already said\nany of them. We operate from these mindsets:\nFocus on human values: Design thinking is human centered design. We look to\nunderstand the needs and emotions of people in order to design solutions for them.\nEmpathy for the people you are designing for and feedback from these\nusers is fundamental to good design\nShow don’t tell: Wherever you can, show people what you are doing, don’t explain it to\nthem. You learn more from listening and observing real reactions, than having people\nrespond to your talking. This is essential when we get to prototyping. Communicate your\nvision in an impactful and meaningful way by creating experiences, using illustrative\nvisuals, and telling good stories.\nEmbrace experimentation: Don’t be afraid to try things. It is ok to fail, in fact, it can be\ngood! The more you experiment and allow yourself to consider different options, the\nmore you will learn and you will get better. Prototyping is not simply a way to validate\nyour idea; it is an integral part of your innovation process. We build to think and learn.\nBe mindful of the process: Know where you are in the design process, what methods to\nuse in that stage, and what your goals are. It is a process for a reason, don’t skip a step,\nbut don’t be afraid to go back if you need more research or to reframe the problem to\nfind better solutions!\nBias towards action: Design thinking is very hands on and action oriented. There will not\nbe a lot of time sitting and learning, we want you to experience everything by doing!\nDesign thinking is a misnomer; it is more about doing that thinking. Bias toward doing\nand making over thinking and meeting.\nRadical collaboration: In order to get a diversity of ideas and solutions, you have to\ncollaborate. In this room there are so many people with different backgrounds and\nexperiences. Use each other to brainstorm and develop your businesses. Later on, you\nwill even collaborate with your customers or anyone else who would interact with your\nproduct/service. Bring together innovators with varied backgrounds and viewpoints.\nEnable breakthrough insights and solutions to emerge from the diversity.\nCraft clarity: Things are going to get messy. That is normal, take care to reframe the\nproblem to make it clear. Produce a coherent vision out of messy problems. Frame it in a\nway to inspire others and to fuel ideation.\nUSER RESEARCH\n5 minutes: Discussion\nEmpathizing is the first step we will look at in the Design Thinking process. We will\nempathize with our users through user research. It is the phase where you learn about\nyour customers behaviors, needs, pains, and gains.\nAsk: Why is the user research phase of Design Thinking so important? What\nfactors—such as cost, access, or long-term usability—might impact user behavior?\n\nUser research helps us to understand how people go about performing tasks and\nachieving goals that are important to them\nIt gives us context and perspective and puts us in a position to respond with useful,\nsimplified, and productive design solutions.\nUser research focuses on understanding user expectations, behaviors, needs, and\nmotivations through methodical, investigative approaches.\nIt helps us identify unarticulated needs and to fill in any gaps in our knowledge about our\nusers, context of use, challenges, and opportunities.\nIt also helps us to align our product and business strategy with the core needs and goals\nof our users.\nInsights are then used to ensure that all product design decisions do benefit the user.\nWHO IS YOUR USER?\nGOALS\nNEEDS\nPAINS\nWANTS\nDESIRES\n20 minutes: Discussion\n5- 10 minutes: Guided discussion on user personas. Who is your user?\nI’m sure by now, you guys already have an idea of who your customers are. We are\ngoing to spend some time taking a look at who we think are our customers at this point.\nLet’s take an example from the room. ___(name person in the room)____, can you tell\nme a little bit about one of your potential customers? Lets look at this as if they were a\nreal person. Tell me the person’s name, where they are from, and what do they love to\ndo.\nGuide the person to fill out all of the components of a user persona (shown on the next\nslide). Make sure you are writing what they say on the board in a way that will draw out\nthe user persona as depicted in the next slides.\nContent could include:\nGeographic: Location, city, reach, country, international vs local\nDemographic: Age, gender, family size, income, ethnic background\nBehavioral: Patterns, usage rates, eco-conscious preferences\nPsychographic: Social class, lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes\nValues:\nGoals: What is this person trying to accomplish?\nCustomer pains: What challenges does this person face? What are the big and small\nproblems they have and how does it affect their lives?\nTell this person’s story: Tell a short story about this person trying to accomplish their goal\n(related to your business). What challenges do they face on their journey?\nIn market segmentation, you can be general. It is a good way to summarize large groups\nof your customers. However, in this case with personas, we want to make it as real as\npossible so we will use very specific information.\n\n*** If you do not feel comfortable facilitating the discussion with a new business idea,\nlearn what is on the example on the hidden slides and create a user persona around that\n(it is for a tourism business). Still make sure to engage the audience by asking them to\ntalk about a potential customer for the tourism business you are creating.\n10 minutes: Activity\nEveryone should now fill out a user persona for their business. We want you to be really\nspecific. Find an example of a real person who might use your product/service. Describe\nthem like they are real. Your customers will be real people with needs, values, and\nfeelings.\nAsk 1-2 people to share their persona they have created.\nDebrief: You guys all did a great job here. Actually, what you just did was create a “fake”\nuser persona. I think a lot of these points might be accurate; however, we are assuming\nthat these are accurate. This is just based on who we THINK is our user, and it is not\nreally based on much data. Over the next few weeks, we are going to spend some time\ndoing intensive user research and come up with accurate user personas by collecting\nboth qualitative and quantitative data.\nRESEARCHING BUSINESS CHALLENGES\nUnderstanding Customer Decision Drivers\nWhat influences purchasing choices?\nHow do external factors affect decisions?\nWhat drives long-term customer loyalty?\nWhat role do cost and access play?\nFacilitator Notes:\nKeep discussion broad and business-focused\nIf participants bring up resource costs or reliability issues, use these as examples but\ndon't force them\nGuide conversation toward understanding comprehensive customer decision-making,\nincluding but not limited to efficiency and cost factors\nTime: 5-7 minutes discussion\nMARKET SHIFTS & ADAPTABILITY\nKey Market Considerations\nEvolving customer needs and priorities\nMarket trends affecting your business\nFactors in customer retention\nOperating costs and efficiency\nFacilitator Notes:\nFrame discussion around business success and market understanding\n\nUse examples from participants' own experiences\nIf resource constraints or costs come up naturally, acknowledge these as standard\nbusiness considerations\nKeep focus on practical business implications rather than sustainability specifically\nTime: 5-7 minutes discussion\nEncourage participants to think about their local market context\n9\nBREAK\nYOUR RESEARCH:\nDO\nLOOK\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\nYour research plan: Welcome back from your break. I hope you are feeling re-energized!\nSo, as we said before, we all have an idea of who our customers are and what they\nwant, but really, these are just assumptions. We might be right on some things, but we\nprobably don’t have the whole picture. That’s why it is so important to create a research\nplan. To help us fill these gaps and give us more insights on what our customers need!\nHow will we do this? Through three research methodologies: Do, Look, and Listen.\nDo is all about experiential learning. Putting yourself in the shoes of your customers.\nLook is learning through observation. Trying to see the behaviors of your customers to\npinpoint needs and opportunities.\nListen is where we talk to our customers through user interviews. Here we hear from\nthem and try to get to the root of their problems and really understand their behaviors\nand emotions.\nDO\nhttps://www.cleancookingalliance.org/binary-data/RESOURCE/file/000/000/407-1.pdf\n20 minutes: Lecture + activity\nDO is all about experiencing what your customers experience. In order to understand the\npains of your customers, you have to go through the process yourself. If your product\nrelates to energy, materials, or waste, try experiencing the challenges your users\nface—like cooking with limited electricity or navigating a city without clean drinking water.\nFor the DO, tell the story of one of IDEO's engineers:\nIDEO is one of the leading companies in product development focusing on design\nthinking methodology. IDEO was working on creating a new design for a stove in a third\n\nworld country. They wanted to design a solution for women to make cooking easier for\nthem. So what did they do? They went to the country and used the stove. They\nexperienced how people cooked every day and got to feel how those women felt using\nthat stove. The lesson in this story is that even if you are an expert, you have to go\nthrough the same experience of your users to feel their challenges!\n15 minutes: Activity - Immerse (DO)\nHave participants partner up\nGive each pair a task:\nGo into the bathroom and wash your hands,\nWalk around the space, get a book, and put it on the table in the kitchen,\nMake a cup of tea\nDo a lap around the space\nGet a piece of paper and write directions to the bathroom\nYou can do anything, be creative!\nOne participant will close their eyes and try to complete the task, while their partner\nguides them and makes sure they don’t run into things or hurt themselves\nThen switch so that both people go through the process\nDEBRIEF: How was that experience? What did it make you learn? How do you think it\nwould be to be blind in a space like this?\nNow think, if you were to design a product for someone who was blind, what are some\nthings you would include? Think about what helped you accomplish the task. Was it\nuseful to hold onto things? Were sounds helpful? Did you like it when someone was in\nfront of you? What were things that frustrated you while you were “blind“, how could that\nbe fixed?\nLESSON: It is important to walk in your customers shoes, especially if you are\ndeveloping a product for them. To see life from their perspective will allow you to truly\nunderstand them and their needs\nWhat are they doing?\nHow are they doing it?\nWhy do you think they are doing that?\nLOOK\n3 minutes: Lecture\nAnother form of research is observation. You can learn so much by just observing people\nin their natural routine. While you are watching, take note of a few things:\nWhat are they doing? What are their actual behaviors? List them step by step. Be detail\noriented.\nHow are they doing it? Are they doing something a little odd that needs further\nexplanation? Is it easy for them? Difficult?\n\nWhy do you think they are doing that? What are they trying to accomplish? What is the\nend goal?\nHow do they navigate trade-offs in their daily decisions?\nWhat patterns emerge in how they balance cost, efficiency, and convenience?\n10 minutes: Activity\nObserve (LOOK): What is this a picture of? What do you see?\nSpend 5-10 minutes getting thoughts from people. Take the time to build up a story\nabout this person.\nWrite everyone's thoughts on the board\nRemember to touch on the previous slides questions (what, how, why)\nWhat do you see versus what do you think based on what you see?\nLESSON: You can learn so much from just looking, taking a step back and trying to\nfigure out what you’re seeing, what you can learn from watching. Keep in mind that you\ncan only learn some things. You can see their actual behaviors. You can observe body\nlanguage and make assumptions about WHY they are doing it that way. If you can, get\nsome clarification and speak to the person to understand why they did it in that way.\nAsk for stories\nTalk about emotions\nAsk why?\nLISTEN\n3 minutes: Lecture\nThe last research method we are going to cover is the User Interview. In a user\ninterview, you spend 2-30 minutes to speak with customers to hear from them about their\nexperiences. If you take the time to speak to customers, they will tell you everything you\nwould ever need to know about how to make a great product for them. They will tell you\nwhat they like and don’t like, the challenges they have with existing solutions and even\nmore! You just have to listen!\n“Tell me about the last time you…”\n“What was the best/ worse...”\n“Why is that?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\nLISTEN\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nBe careful how you phrase questions. It is important that you don’t lead your customers\ninto saying what you want to hear. By doing this, your interview data will be useless. To\ngive you some example of bad interview questions:\nDo you like my idea? People tend to be nice, chances are nobody would want you to feel\nbad and tell you that you have a bad idea. By asking this, you invite people to say “yes, I\nlike your idea” even though it might not be true.\nWould you buy this product? This is another question that is tricky and usually provides\nyou with false information. Again many people would be tempted to say “yes” or\n“probably” to this question. The best way to test if people are willing to buy a product is\nto see if they actually take out their wallet and try.\nDo you have trouble with _____? By posing challenges for them, you are putting words\nin their mouth. Maybe they do have trouble with that, but you want to hear it from them.\nMaybe they are facing the challenge differently than you are. Allow them to share their\nthoughts on their own. Don’t tell or suggest to people how they feel or behave.\nCan you tell me how you normally ….. This question is ALMOST good; however, it is too\ngeneral. You don’t get any real information. If you ask for generalities (‘what is your\nnormal evening like?’) then you’ll get a false picture, it will be their ‘idealized’ evening.\nYou need to ask a question that allows people to give you a specific story that has real\nemotions.\nSo what are good questions to ask? The questions ask for stories, evoke emotions, and\ngo deeper into their actual behaviors.\n“Tell me about the last time you made a decision based on price, convenience, or\nlong-term value.” By asking this question, you are able to get very specific information.\nThey will have details about what they liked and didnt like, there might be a timeline,\netc... You will get very rich information with this question.\n“What was the best/ worst …” By asking these questions, you are learning more about\nwhat the person likes and doesn’t. As you develop your product, it is important to know\nwhat your customers care about and what their problems are.\n“Why is that?” and “Can you tell me more?” These questions are great for going deeper.\nIf your interviewee says something surprising or interesting, you should want to know\nmore about it. Don’t assume anything, ask them about their thoughts.\nAsk why 5 times – keep asking why so that you get to the deeper meaning and emotion\nbehind decisions. Humans make decisions based on emotion, it’s important for you to\nunderstand why your users/ customers make their decisions\n“What drives their choices—cost, reliability, or ease of access? Are there patterns in\nwhat they prioritize?” Ask users open-ended questions to understand their behaviors.\nINTERVIEW\nIntroduce yourself\nIntroduce project\nBuild rapport\n\nEvoke stories\nExplore emotions\nQuestion statements\nThank you & wrap up\nTime\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + example\nEffective Questions:\n\"Tell me about your decision-making process...\"\nWhat matters most when choosing [product/service]?\"\n\"What challenges do you face with current solutions?\"\n\"How do you evaluate different options?\"\nAvoid:\nLeading questions about specific features\nYes/no questions about purchasing\nQuestions that assume user needs\nFocus on open-ended questions that reveal genuine insights\nLet participants develop questions relevant to their business\nIf efficiency or cost topics arise, explore naturally\nTime: 10 minutes practice\nEncourage questions that uncover real user needs and behaviors\nEMPATHY MAP\n8 minutes: Brainstorm\nSo after your interview, you should reflect on and reorganize your information. We will do\nthis through an empathy map.\nAfter you give the explanation of the empathy map, fill it in for the practice interview you\njust had in front of the group (with the trainers). Have it be a conversation and write out\nthe answers as a group on the white board. As you discuss together, highlight some\ninformation about each quadrant (no need to explain each point in detail!)\nThe Says quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or some other\nusability study. Ideally, it contains verbatim and direct quotes from research.\n\"I need something reliable\"\n\"Price is important but so is quality\"\n\"I want something that lasts\"\nThe Thinks quadrant captures what the user is thinking throughout the experience. Ask\nyourself (from the qualitative research gathered): what occupies the user’s thoughts?\nWhat matters to the user? Pay special attention to what users think, but may not be\n\nwilling to vocalize. Try to understand why they are reluctant to share — are they unsure,\nself-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something?\n\"Is this worth the investment?\"\n\"Will this solve my problem?\"\n\"Can I trust this solution?\"\nThe Does quadrant encloses the actions the user takes. From the research, what does\nthe user physically do? How does the user go about doing it?\nCompares options\nResearches before buying\nAsks others for recommendations\nThe Feels quadrant is the user’s emotional state, often represented as an adjective plus\na short sentence for context. Ask yourself: what worries the user? What does the user\nget excited about? How does the user feel about the experience?\nConcerned about making right choice\nWants value for money\nSeeks reliable solutions\nKeep focus on understanding genuine user perspectives\nEncourage deep understanding of user decision-making\nAllow cost and reliability discussions to emerge naturally\nTime: 8 minutes brainstorming\nUse examples relevant to local context\nYou might encounter inconsistencies — for example, seemingly positive actions but\nnegative quotes or emotions coming from the same user. This is when empathy maps\nbecome treasure maps that can uncover nuggets of understanding about our user. It is\nour job as UX professionals to investigate the cause of the conflict and resolve it.\nSome of these quadrants may seem ambiguous or overlapping — for example, it may be\ndifficult to distinguish between Thinks and Feels. Do not focus too much on being\nprecise: if an item may fit into multiple quadrants, just pick one. The 4 quadrants exist\nonly to push our knowledge about users and to ensure we don’t leave out any important\ndimension. (If you don’t have anything to put into a certain quadrant, it’s a strong signal\nthat you need more user research before proceeding in the design process.)\n**This is important to do together because we consistently have trouble with the\nentrepreneurs not understanding how to use the empathy map.\nPRACTICE\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nInterview Your Users (LISTEN)\n5 minutes: prepare questions\nCome up with 3-5 questions you want to learn from your customers about their lives/\nabout your product (5 minutes)\n10 minutes: 2 rounds of interviews (5 minutes each)\nEach person is matched with a partner\n5 minutes: Plot info on an empathy map\nAsk them to plot results on the empathy map right after the interview. This is a great way\nto re-think the interview and reflect.\nEXTREME USER\n5 minutes: Lecture\nWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users, including those\nwho prioritize in their decisions or face resource challenges. Who are the people who\nuse this product every day?\nWhen conducting user interviews, include users at different ends of the spectrum:\nPower users who use your product/service most frequently\nUsers in challenging environments or conditions\nEarly adopters of new solutions\nCost-sensitive users\nUsers with unique needs or constraints\nExample: For a car seat design\nTaxi drivers who spend 12+ hours daily in their vehicles\nDelivery drivers managing high mileage\nUsers in areas with rough road conditions\nUsers who are affected by resource constraints (very little water availability, severe\npower outages, etc)\nFocus on business value of interviewing diverse users\nLet participants identify relevant extreme users for their context\nIf resource or cost discussions emerge, integrate them naturally\nTime: 5 minutes discussion\nWhile creating your user research plan, make sure to include extreme users! You will\nwant to include at least 1-2 extreme users into your research plan.\n------------------------------------\nNotes about Extreme Users to help facilitate discussion, no need to explain them all:\nWhen considering the user's needs in design, it’s very easy for a designer to fall into the\ntrap of designing for the first, average user they can think of.\n\nOnly by understanding the viewpoints of a full range of people is it possible to avoid the\npitfall of designing for yourself.\nThrough speaking to the extreme users and identifying their amplified needs, it can help\npull out more meaningful insights and thus gives the potential to push ideas in different\ndirections that you wouldn’t have previously explored.\nThis group of users can help spark creativity by introducing you to hacks and use cases\nyou wouldn’t have imagined.\nIn the hope of trying to please the mainstream, which is still a very diverse group, it’s all\ntoo easy to end up designing something generic and easy to replicate.\nAn idea that suits an extreme user is more likely to please the mainstream users too.\nBy focusing on the extremes, you can find the highest priority issues. Most commonly,\nthe high priority issue is what motivates people to buy this thing, and what is keeping\nthem from buying this thing?\nExtreme user's are most in-tune with their needs, emotions and behaviors when using a\nproduct or service and can, therefore, articulate needs/challenges better.\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user.\nAsking the user to design for you.\nAsking the user to respond to your idea.\nUSER RESEARCH IS NOT:\n3 minutes: Remember!\nDesigning from your own experiences. You are not the user.\nRemember you want to make sure they are talking, not you!\nDon’t assume things, allow them to share their own experiences\nAsking the user to design for you\nDon’t ask your interviewer what they think the solution is\nDon’t have them list features\nYOU are the designer! You need to gather information from people to create the solution\nthat will best fit their needs. By asking others to design for you, you stunt your creativity\nand can come up with generic solutions.\nAsking the user to respond to your idea\nAvoid asking the user if they like your idea. Any person will just say “yes, I like it” or “yes,\nI will use/buy this”\nIn general, people are polite, so you shouldn’t trust what they say in that way. Make sure\nthe questions are framed in a way where you are just focusing on the challenges they\nare facing and learning about how they are currently dealing with them.\nYou should NOT give an explanation of your idea in a user interview.\n\n3 places to immerse\n30 people to interview\n5 extreme users\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\nSpend the rest of the session writing your user research questions and practicing with\nother people in the cohort (we will also do this tomorrow morning)\nPractice your user research on at least 5 members of the cohort\nGive each other feedback on their interview style. Help them ask the right questions and\ndig deeper.\nResearch:\nCreate your research plan. Consider how external factors—such as cost, market trends,\nor access to key resources—shape user decisions. (They should come tomorrow\nmorning with a DO, LOOK, LISTEN research plan that they will begin to implement\ntomorrow!)\nHow will you experience your customers' pains (DO?)\nWhere can you observe your customers (LOOK)?\nWhere will you go to speak to users (LISTEN)?\nAt least 30 user interviews needed (not including friends and family)!\n20-30 minutes per interview\nInclude 5 extreme users\nYou will have this week and the next to implement your research plan. You need at least\n30 interviews. Go deep in these interviews. Uncover hidden pain points, such as\nfrustrations with affordability, convenience, or product reliability. They should last 20-30\nminutes each! If you are stuck, ask why. Go deeper.\nHow to structure a user interview.\nInterview guide.\nInterview examples and extra tips.\nHANDOUTS\nInstructions for a qualitative\nuser research interview:\nEmail these resources to the group at the end of the session, or before the session\nbegins.\n\n4.

This is more related to you and your actual\ncapabilities.\nHow is tourism going where you are actually operating and can reach customers?\nI used another source here to add on to my previous points. This article is showing in\nnumbers that there are actually a lot of people here, within my businesses geographical\nreach who can benefit from my business. Not just Dubai or Jordan, for example.\nAsk: What kind of story does all of this data tell (slides 6-8)? How does it make you feel\nabout starting a business in the tourism industry?\nPotential answers:\nIt shows that people are actually traveling to this region and spending money\nPeople are spending a lot of money here\nThere is a growing interest year to year\nThis is really interesting data! It makes me want to get into this business now!\nRecap: Explain to them that they want to tell a good story. Use whatever you can to\nvisually show your audience what a great idea your business is. Mostly everyone in the\nclass will feel that a tourism business might be a good idea because we have shown with\nevidence the potential of the market from a reputable source. They should be this\nconvincing with their business ideas.\n8\n\nMiddle East captures about 4% of this market share and is growing at a rate of 5%\nYOUR MARKET\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + activity\n15 minutes: Group example\nWhat can you capture?\nAs a last step, after you show that there is a good market, you need to show what you\ncan actually capture in it.\nOut of the people who want/need your product or service, think about who you can\nactually capture and serve based on your business capabilities.\nThink about your actual capabilities. Although there are 1.3 million tourists traveling to\nKurdistan, there is no way that I am reaching anywhere close to that number! People\ndon’t know about my business and I don’t have the human or financial resources to meet\nall these customers needs.\nThink about what you plan to capture and how you plan to grow in 3 years time.\nGroup brainstorm on the board. Do an example together to build out how a tourism\nbusiness might grow over time. Build the example from discussion from the class. Here\nis an example of what it might end up looking like:\nYear 1: Development year all about testing\n2-3 staff members based in ______ city.\nBuilding out my website and professionalizing my product\nI will only work with 5 tours a month at $200/tour as I am testing my services\nI am expecting about $12,000 in revenues in the first year\nYear 2: Expanding my reach and building a brand\nWill expand to another city and hire 2-3 more staff members\nStronger focus on advertising and building strategic partnerships\nPartnerships and advertising fees on my website will start to generate a small amount of\nrevenues.\nI am aiming to grow monthly tours in _____ city to 10 tours a month at $200/tour\nI am aiming to work with 5 tours a month in new city at $200/ tour\nI am expecting about $36,000 in revenues in the second year\nYear 3: Expand my services and capabilities\nI will reach more people in the cities I am operating in and expand my current offerings.\nNew hires will be made.\nI am expecting to grow the number of tours and advertisements to make $50,000 in the\n3rd year\nI will offer weekend trips and sell merchandise as well. These revenue streams are\nintended to bring in another $20,000 in revenues.\nI am expecting $70,000 in revenues by the 3rd year.\n\n25 minutes: Activity\n20 minutes: Practice\nEntrepreneurs will have 15 minutes to practice this on their own.\nThey will have difficulties, so a trainer should be available to help walk them through\ntheir individual ideas.\n5 minutes: Recap and share\n1-2 entrepreneurs will share their results.\nAdditional questions will be answered if there are any.\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n<1 minute: Lecture\nCompetitive analysis: Who is currently in this space? What are their strengths and\nweaknesses?\nWe do this to learn more about current solutions to your customers problems and to\nidentify opportunities for your business to fill gaps.\n10\nCompetitive rivalry:\nCOMPETITIVE RIVALRY:\n5 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: Does anyone think that they don’t have competitors?\nMost of the group will admit that they have competitors, but you might get 1-2 people\nsaying that they don’t have any competitors\nThe truth is, everyone has competitors one way or another. They aren’t always doing\nexactly what you are doing, but there are other ways that your customers can be\nspending their time and money instead of using you. There are other solutions to their\nproblems right now, even though they might not be as good as your solution.\nBrainstorm direct competition for a tourism app/agency.\nTourism app example:\nDirect competitors: Applications that offer tourism advice available in Sulaimani. Trip\nAdvisor can be considered a direct competitor. It is a website that offers tourism advice\nto people visiting places all around the world, including Sulaimani.\nIndirect competitors: Concierge services at hotels provide a similar service. Other\noptions for tourists include personal research on Google\n\nA substitute product uses a different option to try to solve the same economic need. So\nmaybe the reason someone goes on vacation is to relax. Instead of spending money on\na trip, maybe they choose to stay home and relax for a week. Or maybe they go to the\nspa down the street from them instead.\nCOMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING\nFactor\nMy Business\nCompetitor A\nCompetitor B\nCompetitor C\nOpportunities Identified\n7 minutes: Brainstorm\nCompetitor benchmarking is a tool for you to evaluate how your competitors are serving\nyour customers on a variety of factors that your customers care about. You are doing this\nto learn about where you can add or match value for your product. It is highly unlikely\nthat your idea is entirely original. So it is essential to evaluate the competitive landscape.\nThis helps establish how crowded the market is, how you can improve upon the\ncompetition’s offering and if there are gaps in the market to be exploited.\nPractice competitive benchmarking tool on the board:\nSTEP 1: Identify competitors that already exist (they must benchmark at least 3\ncompetitors).\nWrite on the board: Trip advisor, google, local tour agency, whichever ones you choose\nMake sure to compare it to at least 1 international competitor. This can be useful to find\nbest practices or new ideas.\nSTEP 2: Record features, pros, cons, areas of improvement, successes of each of your\nidentified competitors\nList out the features together\nAsk: What are the things tourists care most about that you would want to compare\nyourself to?\nProducts offered\nSell on credit?\nSales channels\nBrand image\nPrice\nQuality\nService\nReliability\nLocation\nSecurity\n\nMake sure to think about what is important to your specific business and customers.\nConsider factors that came up during user interviews.\nSTEP 3: Identify opportunities or requirements for your business.\nFor example, is everyone offering discounts? You might need to as well if your\ncustomers expect it.\nAre all local tourism agencies operating only in person? There could be an opportunity to\ndifferentiate yourself by having a strong online presence.\nFactors\nMy Business\nCompetitor A\nCompetitor B\nCompetitor C\nProducts\nPrice\nService\nLocation\nSales method\nIdentify:\nStrongest competitors\nMost important features\n\nAreas that make you different\nPoints of innovation\nCOMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING\n2-3 minutes: Lecture\nCompetitive benchmarking is a great way to pinpoint gaps in the market, identify new\nopportunities, and find ways to differentiate yourself from your competitors.\nTo do this:\nYou can look online for similar businesses around the world, but you should also\nexperience the local competitors.\nObserve them, try to buy something, download the app, whatever it is.\nYou should learn as much as you can about what your competitors are doing well and\nwhat they aren't doing well.\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n<1 minute: Lecture\nBarriers to entry: What are the challenges you will face to enter into this market safely?\nWhat do you need financially to enter the market?\n14\nEvaluate barriers to entry:\nKnowledge, skills & tech barriers\nFinancial barriers\nLegal barriers\nIS YOUR BUSINESS FEASIBLE?\n5 minutes: Discussion\nFinally, the last thing we will talk about today are barriers to entry.\nAsk: Does anyone know what this means? Who has an example?\nHave a discussion about general barriers to entry\nPotential answers:\nSkills needed\nFinancial/capital,\nNetwork,\nLegal approvals (zoning, IP, etc),\nSpecific industry knowledge needed,\nR&D\n\nRecap: Now go into the three shown on the slide (knowledge, skills, and\ntech/legal/financial). Tie it into the points they brought up during the discussion.\nKnowledge, skills, and tech barriers: Are you technically able to make this? Do you have\nthe right skills and know-how? If not, how do you plan to get around this barrier?\nLegal barriers: Make sure to include a legal analysis. You should start to do research on\nthe legal side of your business. What are some of the barriers you foresee to launch your\nbusiness from the legal perspective? Each entrepreneur will need to spend time in\ndifferent ministries based on their businesses.\nTrainers can share Roadmap2Startup or other legal resources\nTrainers can also bring in a lawyer for CEO Talk\nFinancial barriers: Finally, what are the financial barriers to launch? This is a barrier that\ncan have a huge impact on your ability to start. It is the amount of money you need to\nopen the business and keep it running before you become profitable. Businesses spend\nmoney before they open their doors. That is what we will focus on right now.\nThings to consider:\nDevelopment costs\nInitial marketing\nInitial working capital\nLegal fees\nMaterials and supplies\nBUILDING A BUDGET:\n0\n1,000,000\n2,000,000\n3,000,000\n4,000,000\n5,000,000\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\nWe will focus on the financial feasibility of your business right now. We are doing this as\na key step to learn if your business is realistic to start based on the resources you have\nand the resources that you would need to start. Start up expenses are those expenses\nincurred before your business is running, but contribute to the long term success of it. In\norder to evaluate what you will need to start, you should create a start up budget.\nAsk: What are the different things that you need to include in your start up budget\ninclude?\nPotential answers:\nDevelopment costs: What you need to actually create and develop your product. This will\nreally depend on what you are making. I listed some examples below, but it can be much\nmore detailed than this.\nApp development\n\nWebsite development\nDomain and Hosting for 1 year\nInitial research and development\nLogo designer\nOffice, store, center, land rent for 6 months to a year (depending on how long you think it\nwill take before you are profitable)\nFurniture/decoration\nConstruction/repairs/paint\nWebsite\nLogo design\nMachinery or tools\nInitial marketing:\nGrand opening event\nSocial media advertisements (when doing the budget, be specific on which platforms you\nwill use and how much you will spend on each)\nFlyers, brochures, marketing material\nSignage\nInitial working capital: Any additional money you will needed to operate your business for\nthe first 6 months to a year while you are still working to become profitable\nSalaries for the first few months\nOperational needs\nLegal fees:\nRegistration\nLawyer fees\nName registration\nIntellectual property and patents\nMaterials and supplies:\nThe first set of items that you need to sell\nMaterials needed to make the final product\nCleaning supplies\nPaper goods\nConsumables\nItem\nPrice\nQuantity\nTotal price\nPersonal contribution\nNotes\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\nTotal costs:\n$-\nPersonal contribution:\n$-\nTotal still needed\n$-\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\nThis is the start up budget found in your feasibility study. You all need to complete one.\nWe want to see how feasible your project idea is on the financial side. How much do you\nneed to get started, and how much are you contributing to this? We want to see that you\nhave skin in the game as well, so don’t forget to count your contribution of time, energy,\nmaterials, etc…\nGo through each of the columns and make sure the group is clear about what each one\nmeans:\nItem: What is the name of the thing you will buy\nPrice: How much is it for 1 of these things\nQuantity: How many do you need?\nTotal price: Price x quantity.\nPersonal contribution: How much of this item are you contributing? Will you pay for the\nwhole thing? A part of it? None of it?\n\nNotes: Please put any notes about the item here. Explain if it is something not\nstraightforward, or if the price is a bit higher or lower than expected. Are you getting it\nfrom somewhere unusual? Any notes about the item here.\nAsk entrepreneurs how they would fill in the information for a tourism business before\nmoving on to the next slide. Go over 2-3 lines just to make sure they understand it.\nItem\nPrice\nQuantity\nTotal price\nPersonal contribution\nNotes\nApp development\n$ 15,000\n1\n$ 15,000\n$-\nI will use a company in India who will make both Android and IOS versions.

I will sponsor a post once a\nweek for 3 months.\nLabor\n$ 500\n6\n$ 3,000\n$ 3,000\nI need to pay for sales representatives for 6 months before the business is profitable\nComputer\n$ 800\n1\n$ 800\n$ 800\nI will donate my personal Lenovo computer to my business (new condition)\n\nYOUR START-UP COSTS\nTotal Costs:\n$ 19,040\nPersonal Contribution:\n$ 3,800\nTotal still needed:\n$ 15,240\nYOUR START-UP COSTS\n5 minutes: Lecture + example\nGo over example:\nThis is a really basic example. The start up costs should be much more detailed and\ncover all the points we mentioned earlier. Make sure to clearly explain the box about\npersonal contribution.\nHow do you start?\nA good place to start is to just brainstorm and flush out everything you think you need.\nMonetize everything. If you are working 10 hours a day on your project, what is that\nworth?\nThen visit your competitors and see what they have or are using. Try to figure out if you\nare missing any major costs.\nThere is also a lot of information on the internet, just Google “what do I need to start a\n____ business” and results will come up. Be aware that it will probably be somewhat\naccurate in terms of WHAT you need, but the price will likely vary from what is already\nonline. You need to look at the local context of the business.\nTo understand the pricing, you should check 2-3 price options and write which one you\nthink would be the best.\n18\nPRACTICE\n25 minutes: Activity\n15 minutes: Activity\nBreak the class up into groups\nThink through the start up costs for an example business (tourism business).\nEntrepreneurs can be creative on the type of tourism business it is (application, agency,\netc…)\n10 minutes: Share\nWhen the group comes back, have a few groups share.\n\nLook for these things to give feedback on:\nWhose costs are extremely high? Why were they so high? Are they buying the most\nexpensive options? Do they have unnecessary costs? It is good to have the ideal\nsituation in mind, but you should consider in a very realistic way, how they can start their\nbusiness for a reasonable amount.\nDoes anyone have an extremely low budget? Think about key things that they aren’t\nincluding. Are they paying for transportation, labor, technology development, etc…\nIs there anything major that was left out?\nRecap: Everyone should create a start up budget for their business, or a new project\nwithin their business. You need to know if you can actually do this financially! This is\nimportant so that you can think through the feasibility of the idea and also set the best\nplan to implement. Keep in mind that this budget can change for a variety of reasons.\nConsider who this budget is for. You? An investor? A donor? The budget might change\nbased on why you are creating it and who it is for.\nAre you pitching to someone else? How much are they willing/able to contribute? There\nare pitch competitions for $1M $500k or $15k and everything in between. Know your\naudience and adjust your budget accordingly.\nCompetitive benchmarking\nStart-up budget\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up!\nTHANK YOU!\nAny Questions?\n21\nUPDATED COPY OF MARKET RESEARCH\nMARKET RESEARCH\nUNDERSTANDING YOUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Understandg your market\n9:25 | Market size\n10:25 | Break\n\n10:40 | Competitive benchmarking\n11:00 | Barriers to entry + first budget\n11:55-12:00 | Wrap up\n----\n9:00 Settle in\nTea/coffee\nCheck in, give updates/news, answer questions\nGo around the room and share progress of entrepreneurs\nAnswer any questions about the pitch or feasibility study\n9:15 Begin the session\nToday we will define what goes into a market analysis and understand how to apply\ndifferent research frameworks to your business.

How does it make you feel\nabout starting a business in the tourism industry?\nPotential answers:\nIt shows that people are actually traveling to this region and spending money\nPeople are spending a lot of money here\nThere is a growing interest year to year\n\nThis is really interesting data! It makes me want to get into this business now!\nRecap: Explain to them that they want to tell a good story. Use whatever you can to\nvisually show your audience what a great idea your business is. Mostly everyone in the\nclass will feel that a tourism business might be a good idea because we have shown with\nevidence the potential of the market from a reputable source. They should be this\nconvincing with their business ideas.\n9\nMiddle East captures about 4% of this market share and is growing at a rate of 5%\nYOUR MARKET\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + activity\n15 minutes: Group example\nWhat can you capture?\nAs a last step, after you show that there is a good market, you need to show what you\ncan actually capture in it.\nOut of the people who want/need your product or service, think about who you can\nactually capture and serve based on your business capabilities.\nThink about your actual capabilities. Although there are 1.3 million tourists traveling to\nKurdistan, there is no way that I am reaching anywhere close to that number! People\ndon’t know about my business and I don’t have the human or financial resources to meet\nall these customers needs.\nThink about what you plan to capture and how you plan to grow in 3 years time.\nGroup brainstorm on the board. Do an example together to build out how a tourism\nbusiness might grow over time. Build the example from discussion from the class. Here\nis an example of what it might end up looking like:\nYear 1: Development year all about testing\n2-3 staff members based in ______ city.\nBuilding out my website and professionalizing my product.\nI will only work with 5 tours a month at $200/tour as I am testing my services\nI am expecting about $12,000 in revenues in the first year\nYear 2: Expanding my reach and building a brand\nWill expand to another city and hire 2-3 more staff members\nStronger focus on advertising and building strategic partnerships.\nPartnerships and advertising fees on my website will start to generate a small amount of\nrevenues.\nI am aiming to grow monthly tours in _____ city to 10 tours a month at $200/tour\nI am aiming to work with 5 tours a month in new city at $200/ tour\n\nI am expecting about $36,000 in revenues in the second year\nYear 3: Expand my services and capabilities.\nI will reach more people in the cities I am operating in and expand my current offerings.\nNew hires will be made.\nI am expecting to grow the number of tours and advertisements to make $50,000 in the\n3rd year\nI will offer weekend trips and sell merchandise as well. These revenue streams are\nintended to bring in another $20,000 in revenues.\nI am expecting $70,000 in revenues by the 3rd year.\n25 minutes: Activity\n20 minutes: Practice\nEntrepreneurs will have 15 minutes to practice this on their own.\nThey will have difficulties, so a trainer should be available to help walk them through\ntheir individual ideas.\n5 minutes: Recap and share\n1-2 entrepreneurs will share their results.\nAdditional questions will be answered if there are any.\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n<1 minute: Lecture\nCompetitive analysis: Who is currently in this space? What are their strengths and\nweaknesses?\nWe do this to learn more about current solutions to your customers problems and to\nidentify opportunities for your business to fill gaps.\n11\nCompetitive rivalry:\nCOMPETITIVE RIVALRY:\n5 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: Does anyone think that they don’t have competitors?\nMost of the group will admit that they have competitors, but you might get 1-2 people\nsaying that they don’t have any competitors\nThe truth is, everyone has competitors one way or another. They aren’t always doing\nexactly what you are doing, but there are other ways that your customers can be\n\nspending their time and money instead of using you. There are other solutions to their\nproblems right now, even though they might not be as good as your solution.\nBrainstorm direct competition for a tourism app/agency.\nTourism app example:\nDirect competitors: Applications that offer tourism advice available in Sulaimani. Trip\nAdvisor can be considered a direct competitor. It is a website that offers tourism advice\nto people visiting places all around the world, including Sulaimani.\nIndirect competitors: Concierge services at hotels provide a similar service. Other\noptions for tourists include personal research on Google\nA substitute product uses a different option to try to solve the same economic need. So\nmaybe the reason someone goes on vacation is to relax. Instead of spending money on\na trip, maybe they choose to stay home and relax for a week. Or maybe they go to the\nspa down the street from them instead.\nCOMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING\nFactor\nMy Business\nCompetitor A\nCompetitor B\nCompetitor C\nOpportunities Identified\n7 minutes: Brainstorm\nCompetitor benchmarking is a tool for you to evaluate how your competitors are serving\nyour customers on a variety of factors that your customers care about. You are doing this\nto learn about where you can add or match value for your product. It is highly unlikely\nthat your idea is entirely original. So it is essential to evaluate the competitive landscape.\nThis helps establish how crowded the market is, how you can improve upon the\ncompetition’s offering and if there are gaps in the market to be exploited.\nPractice competitive benchmarking tool on the board:\nSTEP 1: Identify competitors that already exist (they must benchmark at least 3\ncompetitors).\nWrite on the board: Trip advisor, google, local tour agency, whichever ones you choose\nMake sure to compare it to at least 1 international competitor. This can be useful to find\nbest practices or new ideas.\nSTEP 2: Record features, pros, cons, areas of improvement, successes of each of your\nidentified competitors\nList out the features together\nAsk: What are the things tourists care most about that you would want to compare\nyourself to?\nProducts offered\n\nSell on credit?\nSales channels\nBrand image\nPrice\nQuality\nService\nReliability\nLocation\nSecurity\nTo support green perspectives, consider:\nOperating Costs\nEnergy usage\nMaterial efficiency\nWaste management\nEquipment & Technology\nMaintenance costs\nUpgrade needs\nEfficiency features\nResource Management\nSupply reliability\nCost control measures\nLong-term savings\nMake sure to think about what is important to your specific business and customers.\nConsider factors that came up during user interviews.\nSTEP 3: Identify opportunities or requirements for your business.\nFor example, is everyone offering discounts? You might need to as well if your\ncustomers expect it.\nAre all local tourism agencies operating only in person? There could be an opportunity to\ndifferentiate yourself by having a strong online presence.\nFactors\nMy Business\nCompetitor A\nCompetitor B\nCompetitor C\nProducts\n\nPrice\nService\nLocation\nSales method\nEfficiency\nBrand/Values alignment\nIdentify:\nStrongest competitors\nMost important features\nAreas that make you different\nPoints of innovation\nCOMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING\n2-3 minutes: Lecture\nCompetitive benchmarking is a great way to pinpoint gaps in the market, identify new\nopportunities, and find ways to differentiate yourself from your competitors.\nTo do this:\nYou can look online for similar businesses around the world, but you should also\nexperience the local competitors.\nObserve them, try to buy something, download the app, whatever it is.\nYou should learn as much as you can about what your competitors are doing well and\nwhat they aren't doing well.\nBUILDING A RESILIENT BUSINESS MODEL\nMarket Trends & Business Impact\nExternal factors affecting costs\n\nChanges in customer preferences\nCompetitive pressures\nSmart Growth Planning\nEquipment & operational choices\nLong-term cost management\nMarket positioning\nFeasibility Checklist\nCustomer demand validated\nCosts & pricing strategy realistic\nOperations plan sustainable\nGrowth strategy defined\nFacilitator Notes:\n• Frame as essential business planning, not environmental focus\n• Use local examples of successful adaptable businesses\n• Connect directly to upcoming budget exercise\n• Show how smart planning reduces costs\n15\nMarket size\nCompetitive analysis\nBarriers to entry\nMARKET ANALYSIS:\n<1 minute: Lecture\nBarriers to entry: What are the challenges you will face to enter into this market safely?\nWhat do you need financially to enter the market? Are there industry trends,\ntechnologies, or operational efficiencies that could help reduce costs or improve\nlong-term financial sustainability?\nAdditional discussion question: \"What external trends could increase operating costs in\nthe next 5 years? How can businesses adapt?\"\nDuring the discussion, ask each participant to identify 1 business cost risk that could be\naffected by external trends (including energy, materials, or regulations).\n16\nEvaluate barriers to entry:\nKnowledge, skills & tech barriers\nFinancial barriers\nLegal barriers\nIS YOUR BUSINESS FEASIBLE?\n\nOperational costs\n5 minutes: Discussion\nFinally, the last thing we will talk about today are barriers to entry.\nAsk: Does anyone know what this means? Who has an example?\nHave a discussion about general barriers to entry\nPotential answers:\nSkills needed\nFinancial/capital,\nNetwork,\nLegal approvals (zoning, IP, etc),\nSpecific industry knowledge needed,\nR&D\nRecap: Now go into the three shown on the slide (knowledge, skills, and\ntech/legal/financial). Tie it into the points they brought up during the discussion.\nKnowledge, skills, and tech barriers: Are you technically able to make this? Do you have\nthe right skills and know-how? If not, how do you plan to get around this barrier?\nLegal barriers: Make sure to include a legal analysis. You should start to do research on\nthe legal side of your business. What are some of the barriers you foresee to launch your\nbusiness from the legal perspective? Each entrepreneur will need to spend time in\ndifferent ministries based on their businesses.\nTrainers can share Roadmap2Startup or other legal resources\nTrainers can also bring in a lawyer for CEO Talk\nFinancial barriers: Finally, what are the financial barriers to launch? This is a barrier that\ncan have a huge impact on your ability to start. It is the amount of money you need to\nopen the business and keep it running before you become profitable. Businesses spend\nmoney before they open their doors. That is what we will focus on right now.\nOperational costs: Once your business is running, there are ongoing costs to sustain it.\nThese include rent, salaries, utilities, raw materials, and other recurring expenses\nnecessary to maintain operations. Many businesses struggle not just with start-up costs\nbut also with keeping their business running until they reach profitability.\nPlanning for Long-Term Profitability\nEfficient Spending – Identify high-impact investments that reduce long-term costs.\nBudgeting for Uncertainty – Build in financial buffers for price fluctuations.\nCost vs. Value – Not all expenses are bad—some investments improve profit margins\nover time.\nFINANCIAL PLANNING & SMART GROWTH\nDiscussion: Which expenses will help your business grow, and which are unnecessary\nrisks?\nFacilitator Notes:\nWhy this matters: Helps participants differentiate smart investments vs. unnecessary\ncosts.\n\nKey framing: Budgeting isn’t just about reducing costs—it’s about spending strategically.\nGuiding questions:\nWhich early investments will have long-term payoffs?\nAre there high-risk costs that could be reduced?\nThings to consider:\nDevelopment costs\nInitial marketing\nInitial working capital\nLegal fees\nMaterials and supplies\nOperational costs\nBUILDING A BUDGET:\n0\n1,000,000\n2,000,000\n3,000,000\n4,000,000\n5,000,000\nFacilitator Notes:\nFrame as financial planning essentials\nShow ROI calculations for efficient choices\nKeep focus on business success\nItem\nPrice\nQuantity\nTotal price\nPersonal contribution\nNotes\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\n$-\nTotal costs:\n$-\nPersonal contribution:\n$-\nTotal still needed\n$-\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\nThis is the start up budget found in your feasibility study. You all need to complete one.\nWe want to see how feasible your project idea is on the financial side. How much do you\nneed to get started, and how much are you contributing to this? We want to see that you\nhave skin in the game as well, so don’t forget to count your contribution of time, energy,\nmaterials, etc…\nGo through each of the columns and make sure the group is clear about what each one\nmeans:\nItem: What is the name of the thing you will buy\nPrice: How much is it for 1 of these things\nQuantity: How many do you need?\nTotal price: Price x quantity.\nPersonal contribution: How much of this item are you contributing? Will you pay for the\nwhole thing? A part of it? None of it?\nNotes: Please put any notes about the item here. Explain if it is something not\nstraightforward, or if the price is a bit higher or lower than expected. Are you getting it\nfrom somewhere unusual? Any notes about the item here.\nAsk entrepreneurs how they would fill in the information for a tourism business before\nmoving on to the next slide. Go over 2-3 lines just to make sure they understand it.\n\nItem\nPrice\nQuantity\nTotal price\nPersonal contribution\nNotes\nApp development\n$ 15,000\n1\n$ 15,000\n$-\nI will use a company in India who will make both Android and IOS versions.

The start up costs should be much more detailed and\ncover all the points we mentioned earlier. Make sure to clearly explain the box about\npersonal contribution.\nHow do you start?\nA good place to start is to just brainstorm and flush out everything you think you need.\nMonetize everything. If you are working 10 hours a day on your project, what is that\nworth?\nThen visit your competitors and see what they have or are using. Try to figure out if you\nare missing any major costs.\nThere is also a lot of information on the internet, just Google “what do I need to start a\n____ business” and results will come up. Be aware that it will probably be somewhat\naccurate in terms of WHAT you need, but the price will likely vary from what is already\nonline. You need to look at the local context of the business.\nTo understand the pricing, you should check 2-3 price options and write which one you\nthink would be the best.\n21\nPRACTICE\n25 minutes: Activity\n15 minutes: Activity\nBreak the class up into groups\nThink through the start up costs for an example business (tourism business).\nEntrepreneurs can be creative on the type of tourism business it is (application, agency,\netc…)\n10 minutes: Share\nWhen the group comes back, have a few groups share.\nLook for these things to give feedback on:\nWhose costs are extremely high? Why were they so high? Are they buying the most\nexpensive options? Do they have unnecessary costs? It is good to have the ideal\nsituation in mind, but you should consider in a very realistic way, how they can start their\nbusiness for a reasonable amount.\nDoes anyone have an extremely low budget? Think about key things that they aren’t\nincluding. Are they paying for transportation, labor, technology development, etc…\nIs there anything major that was left out?\n\nRecap: Everyone should create a start up budget for their business, or a new project\nwithin their business. You need to know if you can actually do this financially! This is\nimportant so that you can think through the feasibility of the idea and also set the best\nplan to implement. Keep in mind that this budget can change for a variety of reasons.\nConsider who this budget is for. You? An investor? A donor? The budget might change\nbased on why you are creating it and who it is for.\nAre you pitching to someone else? How much are they willing/able to contribute? There\nare pitch competitions for $1M $500k or $15k and everything in between. Know your\naudience and adjust your budget accordingly.\nCompetitive benchmarking\nStart-up budget\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up!\nTHANK YOU!\nAny Questions?\n24\n6. Creativity and Ideation\nORIGINAL VERSION\nCreativity\n& Ideation\nDESIGN THINKING\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Begin the session\n9:20 | How Might We problem statement (30 minutes)\n9:50 | About creativity and ideation: Pre-brainstorm (20 minutes)\n10:10 | Brainstorming (45 minutes)\n15 minutes: rapid brainstorm\n10 minutes: $0\n10 minutes: $100,000,000\n\n10 minutes: Google\n10:55 | Break\n11:10 | Idea selection (25 minutes)\n11:35 | Challenge assumptions (20 minutes)\n11:55 | Wrap up\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\nTea/coffee\nAnswer entrepreneur questions\nPrepare the room for ideation sessions\n9:15 | Begin the session\nGood morning everyone! How are you doing today?\nBy now we have done research and started to evaluate it. Today we will define clear\nproblem statements for our personas and generate many ideas that you can use for your\nbusiness.\nDefine your problem statement.\nLearn different ideation and selection techniques.\nChallenge assumptions you are making about your business.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES:\n1 minute: Objectives\nDefine your problem statement: First, we are going to continue from yesterday and write\nout a clear problem statement.\nLearn different ideation and idea selection techniques: Next, we will go over some\nideation techniques to apply to our businesses to solve the problem statement you have\nidentified.\nChallenge assumptions you are making about your business: By challenging your\nassumptions, we will make even the craziest ideas possible.\nIdeate to find the best ideas\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n2 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: Can someone tell us where on the design thinking process we are today?\n\nSo far we have empathized with our customers and have reframed our data. Now we will\nclearly define the problem our “personas” are facing, and think through creative ways to\nsolve the problem.\nUser personas\nCustomer journey map\nProblem statement\nANALYZE USER RESEARCH\n1 minute: Transition\nBased on the personas you have created, and their journey map we are now going to\ndefine problem statements.\nAn integral part of the design thinking process is the definition of a meaningful and\nactionable problem statement. This problem statement will be the focus when beginning\nproblem solving. This is perhaps the most challenging part of the Design Thinking\nprocess. It is difficult; however, if you have done enough research, created your user\npersonas, and went over their journey, it is not hard at all!\nHow Might We problem statement (30 minutes)\nHow might we help\n(our customers) (need as a verb),\nkeeping in mind (info about our customers).\nHOW MIGHT WE…\n10-15 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm\nA “How Might We” statement is a meaningful and actionable problem statement, which\nwill allow you to ideate in a goal-oriented manner. Your HMW captures your design\nvision by defining the RIGHT challenge to address in the ideation sessions. You\narticulate a HMW statement by combining your knowledge about the user you are\ndesigning for, their needs, and the insights which you’ve come to know while researching\nand empathizing with them.\nGroup brainstorm: Make a How Might We statement for the tourism agency business:\nDo this together on the board\nAllow them to develop the HMW statement for the tourism agency business\nStep 1: Define your customer (which persona are you focusing on?)\nStep 2: What is that personas need? Remember to focus on needs as verbs to ensure a\nvariety of solutions are possible\nStep 3: Write an insight about them\nSome answers they might end up with include:\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\n\nHow might we help local tourists find and book inexpensive vacations for their families\nkeeping in mind they always look for recommendations from family and friends because\nthey don’t trust the agencies.\nRemind the class that this information should be based on their research. The example\nwe are giving might not be true because we don’t have any evidence to prove this.\n----------\nHere is some more information about HMW statements:\nIdeation sessions require dedicated environments for standing back to seek every angle\nafter addressing the right problem. So Before starting to look for ideas, your team needs\na clearly defined problem to tackle – a focused problem statement to inspire and guide\neveryone.\nYour HMW should be an actionable problem statement that will drive the rest of your\ndesign work.\n(HMW) questions are questions that have the potential to spark ideation sessions such\nas brainstorms. They should be broad enough for a wide range of solutions, but narrow\nenough that specific solutions can be created for them. “How Might We” questions\nshould be based on the observations you’ve gathered in the Empathise stage of the\nDesign Thinking process.\nFor example, you have observed that youths tend to not watch TV programs on the TV\nat home, some questions which can guide and spark your ideation session could be:\nHow might we make TV more social, so youths feel more engaged?\nHow might we enable TV programs to be watched anywhere, at any time?\nHow might we make watching TV at home more exciting?\nThe HMW questions open up to Ideation sessions where you explore ideas, which can\nhelp you solve your design challenge in an innovative way.\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\n15 minutes: Lecture + activity\nGo over another example\nAfter you have created the HMW statement together, show them this one as another\nexample of a good HMW statement.\nRecap: By defining a “How might we…?” question, you are able to clearly define the\nproblem for your user and this will help prompt an effective pathway towards potential\nsolutions.\n10-15 minutes: Activity\n\nCreate HMW statement\nNow, everyone should create HMW statements for each of your user personas that you\nhave created.\nEach persona (that you made yesterday) should have their own HMW statement based\non their individual needs\nMake sure to go around the room and help entrepreneurs define accurate statements.\nRemember to define needs as VERBS! If you don’t do this accurately, your ideation\nsessions will be limited to only a few answers.\nCREATIVITY\n5 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: What is creativity? How can a person be creative? Are you born a creative person?\nCan you become a creative person?\nHave a discussion on the white board talking about a few of these points.\n- Steve Jobs\n“Creativity is just connecting things.”\n3 minutes: Explanation\n“Creativity is just connecting things” -Steve Jobs\nIt’s not something that some people have and others don’t. It is about systematically\ngoing through the process of being creative to find solutions. Creativity isn’t inventing\nnew things, it’s allowing you to think and consider things that weren’t obvious at first.\nReally creative people sometimes point out really obvious solutions that nobody put in\nthis particular context before.\nFull quote from Steve jobs “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative\npeople how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it,\nthey just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they\nwere able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the\nreason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have\nthought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that’s too rare a\ncommodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they\ndon’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a\nbroad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human\nexperience, the better design we will have.”\nSometimes the answer is obvious, but you won’t look past your imagination or mental\nlimits and roadblocks you put up or yourself\nSometimes we need to include other people who have more diverse experiences than\nwe do\nWe need to be open to alternative possibilities and not think in a linear way\n\nIDEATION\n3 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: What is Ideation? Why is it important? How do you do it?\nHave a discussion on the white board talking about a few of these points.\nIdeation is a creative process where the people involved generate ideas in a variety of\nways.\nIt is the third stage in the Design Thinking process.\nEntrepreneurs should aim to produce as many ideas as they can to address a problem\nstatement\nIdeation is a judgment-free environment open to silly and crazy ideas.\nCome up with innovative ideas\nIdentify new opportunities\nBring together the strengths of your team.\nCreate volume and variety of ideas\n10\nIDEATION WILL HELP YOU:\n3 minutes: Lecture\nIdeation will help you with:\nCome up with innovative ideas\nIdentify new opportunities\nBring together the strengths of your team.\nCreate volume and variety of ideas\nAsk: What else?\nAsk the right questions and innovate.\nStep beyond the obvious solutions and therefore increase the innovation potential of\nyour solution.\nGet obvious solutions out of your heads, and drive your team beyond those simple\nsolutions and into innovative ones.\n11\n1 minute: Lecture\nThrough creativity and ideation, you are turning messy problems and questions into\nsolutions and good ideas.\nThe answer might not seem obvious, but over time, it can become clearer and clearer.\nNow that we have our problem statements, the solution won’t be very difficult to come up\nwith.\n\n“It's not about coming up with the right idea, it’s about generating the broadest range of\npossibilities.”\n-Hasso Plattner\n1 minutes: Lecture\n“It's not about coming up with the ‘right’ idea, it’s about generating the broadest range of\npossibilities.”\nBefore we get into the brainstorming session, I want you to consider this quote.\nWe are going to set some ground rules to make sure that we are able to all of you\nleaving this session with a wide range of ideas and possibilities for your business.\nStart with “How Might We”\nNo judgement or criticism\nGo for weird, wacky and wild ideas\nQuantity over quality\nBe visual\nOne conversation at a time\nRULES\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\nAsk: Before we begin the brainstorm, we need to set some ground rules. As always, it\nwould be great to hear from you all first to see what rules you want to set for this\nbrainstorm.\nTake 3-5 minutes to listen to everyone's ideas and write them down on the whiteboard.\nGreat, I have a few additional rules that I would like to add as well to make sure the\nsession is really productive.\nStart with a problem statement (HMW): This is necessary to keep the team focused on\nthe right topic. Make sure that you have defined your need as a verb, otherwise you will\nface roadblocks early on in the brainstorm.\nThere is no judgement or criticism: Write down everything! There is no such thing as a\nbad idea. By being bold and curious, you can challenge commonly held beliefs and\nexplore possibilities past typically limited imagination.\nGo for weird, wacky and wild ideas: Even if these ideas seem ridiculous, it helps to break\ndown barriers and think more creatively. Additionally, there could be an element that is\napplicable in a “bad” or “crazy” idea. The most innovative ideas are often these\nunrealistic or wacky ideas.\n\nQuantity over quality: Get as many as possible, try not to stop writing the whole time. By\nforcing yourself to go for quantity, you are reaching ideas that you would have never\neven considered.\nBuild on each others' ideas: Lets “Yes, and” this! Team members should take each\nothers’ ideas and build on them, find ways to link concepts, recognize patterns and flip\nseemingly impossible notions over to reveal new insights.\nBe visual: If you cant express your idea, no worries, draw them out or express them in\nanother way.\nOne conversation at a time: Don’t interrupt each other and let everyone on the team\nhave an opportunity to speak and put their ideas to paper.\nRecap: By following these rules, you are setting yourself up for a successful brainstorm!\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\n5-8 minutes: Brainstorm\nSo let’s do a quick example all together.\nHave a brainstorm with the class on how to solve this HMW statement “How might we\nhelp tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are worried about\nsafety and want to be in a good neighborhood”\nPotential answers could be:\nSharing pictures of hotel rooms\nGetting customer feedback\nRating systems\nHaving an application that shows restaurants, hotels, prices, tours, etc…\nCollecting information about all the hotels in the neighborhood/city/region in a database\nHave a transportation guide\nHave a security guide\nPush them to give crazier ideas\nWork with airlines to put hotels in the airports on the screens as tourists are arriving to\nfilter through options\nRent a house in a village where it is super cheap, but can be cool for a cultural visit\nEtc…\n2 minutes: Recap\nGreat, you just saw how we were able to generate so many ideas in just a few minutes.\nRemember there are no bad ideas and different perspectives help generate more ideas!\nWe were able to break through any judgement and have everyone feel comfortable to\nthrow out allow all kinds of ideas\n\nIt’s ok if you come up with “bad” ideas, because you never know who it might work for? –\nactually using bad ideas could be a great way to come up with good ones in some\ncases.\n16\nBRAINSTORM\n<1 minute: Explanation\nOk let’s get started!\nWe will spend the next 45 minutes brainstorming on the ideas of each other.\nEveryone should get into pairs. If there is an extra person, you can brainstorm with the\ntrainer (a group of 3 would throw off the timing).\nRAPID BRAINSTORMING\n15 minutes: Activity\nRapid brainstorming: We are going to start off with a rapid brainstorm.\nYou will have 3 minutes for both partners to brainstorm on one HMW statement.\nOnce those 3 minutes are up, do another 3 minutes on the same HMW statement.

Did you come up with any great ideas? Take a few minutes to\nhear from the group. What was their experience like? How many ideas do they have?\nIt is clear that we have been able to generate so many ideas. But what do we do with\nthese? How do we evaluate them and which should we implement? Now what we are\ngoing to do is take a look at all of these ideas and try to prioritize them to see which ones\nyou should actually implement for your businesses. We will look at 2 idea selection\ntechniques:\nDot voting (5 minutes)\nNow, How, Wow (15 minutes)\nDot Voting\nNow, WoW & How.\nHOW TO SELECT IDEAS:\nDOT VOTING:\n20 minutes: Activity\nIdea selection and prioritization: We will look at 2 idea selection techniques: Dot voting\nand Now, How, Wow. We will start with Dot Voting.\nDot Voting:\nDot voting is very simple. Make sure all ideas which the participants have chosen are on\nindividual Post-its.\n\nThen you give all participants a number of votes (around three to four should do per\nperson).\nEach person will “vote” and choose their personal favorite ideas.\nParticipants vote by using stickers, post-it notes, or simply using a marker to make a dot\non the ideas they like. This process allows every member to have an equal say in the\nshortlisted ideas. You can also use variations in color in order to let participants vote on\nwhich ideas they like the most or which they dislike the most.\nHave everyone take 5 minutes to vote for the ideas they liked the most during their\nbrainstorm sessions\nAn alternative idea for selection (just for trainers information, no need to explain this):\nThe Four Categories method entails dividing ideas according to their relative\nabstractness, ranging from the most rational choice to the 'long shot'. The four\ncategories are: the rational choice, the most likely to delight, the darling, and the long\nshot. This method ensures that the team covers all grounds, from the most practical to\nthe ideas with the most potential to deliver innovative solutions. What Best practice: How\nIdeation participants decide upon one or two ideas for each of these categories: the\nrational choice, the most likely to delight, the darling, and the long shot. If you’re a\nrelatively small team you simply discuss the pros and cons of the chosen ideas.\nNow, How, Wow:\nNow\nWow\nHow\n15 minutes: Activity\nPlot ideas\n5 minutes: Explanation\nAnother way to evaluate ideas is through the Now, How, Wow Matrix. This is a great tool\nfor you to frame the best ideas and what you should actually begin to implement.\nExplain the differences between the categories.\nMake sure to note the x and y axis’. X axis is about how unique the idea is while y axis is\nabout the ease of implementation of the idea.\nNow: These ideas are realistic. You can probably implement them right now; however,\nthey might lack novelty.\nWow: These ideas are also realistic, and you were surprised by them. It is probably the\ncase that nobody is doing this right now and it’s a good idea.\nHow: These ideas are big projects and probably require strategic innovation. You don’t\nknow where to start with these ideas, but might be great for the future.\nFourth box: If it is not feasible and not original, don’t even consider it! You can probably\nscrap those ideas.\n10 minutes: Application\n\nIDEA FILTERATION:\nMeet customer needs\nNew and creative\nFeasible\nTeam passion\nCan make money\n5 minutes: Lecture + activity\nLastly, you want to do a final check in on your ideas.\nYou always want to make sure that this idea is something that is useful and valued by\nyour customers.\nAsk these questions and check if it is in line with your customers needs\nDoes it fit with people's needs? Is there demand?\nDoes it really meet the goals set initially?\nDoes it meet the requirements in our problem statement/Point Of View?\nDoes it answer our “How Might We” questions in a satisfying way?\nIs it different enough from what exists to add additional value?\nDo we have access to the budget—enough to implement even partially?\nIs the technology available?\nWill we be able to roll it out with the available resources?\nCan we get approval from decision makers?\nCan it make money?\nGet rid of any that are problematic.\n25\nList obstacles\nChallenge those obstacles – What if?\nTest your solutions!\nCHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS\n15 minutes: Lecture + application\nI know that some of these ideas seem crazy, or even impossible, but don’t let that stand\nin your way of implementing an innovative or otherwise great idea.\nI would like to challenge you on some of the really crazy ideas you came up with. Take\none of the “How” ideas and go through these steps.\nStep 1: List out all the obstacles that are in the way. Remember that everything is a\nperspective. The one and only “truth” does not exist. Even this statement is a\nperspective – or a belief. Typical assumptions include:\nThat it is impossible to do something – particularly within constraints such as time and\ncost.\nThat something works because of certain rules or conditions.\nThat people believe, think, or need certain things.\nThink money, resources, connections, legal barriers, time, etc...\n\nStep 2: Challenge assumptions: Assume that you can overcome and challenge all\nassumptions. For each of those obstacles, consider what if that particular obstacles end\ngoal was actually possible\nAsk questions like “How could this be not true?” or “What if we could do this twice as well\nin half the time?”\nConsider if you could use an alternative resource\nIs there a way around the obstacle?\nCan you skip that step?\nStep 3: Find ways of making the challenge a reality: The real challenge is to make it\nhappen in reality.\nTest your solutions! If this is something really worth doing, make some steps to actually\ntry it out and see if it works!\nTest out any alternatives you identified and see if you could get around those obstacles.\n5 minutes: Lecture\nFirst principle story: Tell the story of Elon Musk as an example of how he challenges\nassumptions to create innovative businesses.\nHe uses the first principle theory to reevaluate problems by breaking challenges into its\nsimplest parts.\nHe uses this technique often when he faces barriers that might seem “impossible” to\novercome.\nElon Musk had a dream to get to space. To do this, he needed to buy rockets. He tried\nto buy rockets from the USA, but it was too expensive. He then went to Russia to see if\nthere were better options for him; however, they were still too expensive. He negotiated\nwith Russia 3 times to get rockets, but he had no success. He was really frustrated by\nthis, but refused to quit. He started to ask himself why he couldn’t build the rockets\nhimself. He asked, \"What if we build the rocket and the launch pad in a new way that\ncuts traditional costs for creating a rocket “. It sounds crazy to completely reinvent the\nrocket, but because he was able to ask those “what if” questions, it allowed him to\novercome the financial barrier that was stopping him. He held a series of brainstorming\nsessions to find the best way to break down and rebuild a rocket. He worked with his\nteam every week until they tackled the problem and found a cheaper way for creating\nrockets. He now has SpaceX and is changing the future of space exploration.\nMoral of the story is don’t let anything stop you. Break the problem down and find clever\nsolutions around barriers.\nAsk “what-if” questions to help break down those barriers.\nAsk: How can you guys apply this theory to your businesses? Is it relevant for you?\n28\nBRAIN WALKING\n\n5 minutes: Wrap up\nGreat job today everyone!\nMake sure that you keep all of your work up on the walls. We will come back after lunch\nand “brain walk”\nSometimes we need to step back after brainstorming to collect your thoughts and\nregroup.\nThis afternoon we will all go around and read through everyone's ideas and provide\nadditional feedback from the rest of the group.\nThis way you get more perspectives and hopefully more ideas!\nTHANK YOU!\nAny Questions?\nUPDATED COPY OF CREATIVITY AND IDEATION\nCreativity\n& Ideation\nDESIGN THINKING\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Begin the session\n9:20 | How Might We problem statement (30 minutes)\n9:50 | About creativity and ideation: Pre-brainstorm (20 minutes)\n10:10 | Brainstorming (45 minutes)\n15 minutes: rapid brainstorm\n10 minutes: $0\n10 minutes: $100,000,000\n10 minutes: Google\n10:55 | Break\n11:10 | Idea selection (25 minutes)\n11:35 | Challenge assumptions (20 minutes)\n11:55 | Wrap up\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\nTea/coffee\nAnswer entrepreneur questions\nPrepare the room for ideation sessions\n\n9:15 | Begin the session\nGood morning everyone! How are you doing today?\nBy now we have done research and started to evaluate it. Today we will define clear\nproblem statements for our personas and generate many ideas that you can use for your\nbusiness.\nDefine your problem statement.\nLearn different ideation and selection techniques.\nChallenge assumptions you are making about your business.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES:\n1 minute: Objectives\nDefine your problem statement: First, we are going to continue from yesterday and write\nout a clear problem statement.\nLearn different ideation and idea selection techniques: Next, we will go over some\nideation techniques to apply to our businesses to solve the problem statement you have\nidentified.\nChallenge assumptions you are making about your business: By challenging your\nassumptions, we will make even the craziest ideas possible.\nIdeate to find the best ideas\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n2 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: Can someone tell us where on the design thinking process we are today?\nSo far we have empathized with our customers and have reframed our data. Now we will\nclearly define the problem our “personas” are facing, and think through creative ways to\nsolve the problem.\nUser personas\nCustomer journey map\nProblem statement\nANALYZE USER RESEARCH\n1 minute: Transition\nBased on the personas you have created, and their journey map we are now going to\ndefine problem statements.\n\nAn integral part of the design thinking process is the definition of a meaningful and\nactionable problem statement. This problem statement will be the focus when beginning\nproblem solving. This is perhaps the most challenging part of the Design Thinking\nprocess. It is difficult; however, if you have done enough research, created your user\npersonas, and went over their journey, it is not hard at all!\nHow Might We problem statement (30 minutes)\nHow might we help\n(our customers) (need as a verb),\nkeeping in mind (info about our customers).\nHOW MIGHT WE…\n10-15 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm\nA “How Might We” statement is a meaningful and actionable problem statement, which\nwill allow you to ideate in a goal-oriented manner. Your HMW captures your design\nvision by defining the RIGHT challenge to address in the ideation sessions. You\narticulate a HMW statement by combining your knowledge about the user you are\ndesigning for, their needs, and the insights which you’ve come to know while researching\nand empathizing with them.\nGroup brainstorm: Make a How Might We statement for the tourism agency business:\nDo this together on the board\nAllow them to develop the HMW statement for the tourism agency business\nStep 1: Define your customer (which persona are you focusing on?)\nStep 2: What is that personas need? Remember to focus on needs as verbs to ensure a\nvariety of solutions are possible\nStep 3: Write an insight about them\nSome answers they might end up with include:\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\nHow might we help local tourists find and book inexpensive vacations for their families\nkeeping in mind they always look for recommendations from family and friends because\nthey don’t trust the agencies.\nRemind the class that this information should be based on their research. The example\nwe are giving might not be true because we don’t have any evidence to prove this.\n----------\nHere is some more information about HMW statements:\nIdeation sessions require dedicated environments for standing back to seek every angle\nafter addressing the right problem. So Before starting to look for ideas, your team needs\na clearly defined problem to tackle – a focused problem statement to inspire and guide\neveryone.\n\nYour HMW should be an actionable problem statement that will drive the rest of your\ndesign work.\n(HMW) questions are questions that have the potential to spark ideation sessions such\nas brainstorms. They should be broad enough for a wide range of solutions, but narrow\nenough that specific solutions can be created for them. “How Might We” questions\nshould be based on the observations you’ve gathered in the Empathise stage of the\nDesign Thinking process.\nFor example, you have observed that youths tend to not watch TV programs on the TV\nat home, some questions which can guide and spark your ideation session could be:\nHow might we make TV more social, so youths feel more engaged?\nHow might we enable TV programs to be watched anywhere, at any time?\nHow might we make watching TV at home more exciting?\nThe HMW questions open up to Ideation sessions where you explore ideas, which can\nhelp you solve your design challenge in an innovative way.\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\n15 minutes: Lecture + activity\nGo over another example\nAfter you have created the HMW statement together, show them this one as another\nexample of a good HMW statement.\nRecap: By defining a “How might we…?” question, you are able to clearly define the\nproblem for your user and this will help prompt an effective pathway towards potential\nsolutions.\n10-15 minutes: Activity\nCreate HMW statement\nNow, everyone should create HMW statements for each of your user personas that you\nhave created.\nEach persona (that you made yesterday) should have their own HMW statement based\non their individual needs\nMake sure to go around the room and help entrepreneurs define accurate statements.\nRemember to define needs as VERBS! If you don’t do this accurately, your ideation\nsessions will be limited to only a few answers.\nCREATIVITY\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is creativity? How can a person be creative? Are you born a creative person?\nCan you become a creative person?\nHave a discussion on the white board talking about a few of these points.\n- Steve Jobs\n“Creativity is just connecting things.”\n3 minutes: Explanation\n“Creativity is just connecting things” -Steve Jobs\nIt’s not something that some people have and others don’t. It is about systematically\ngoing through the process of being creative to find solutions. Creativity isn’t inventing\nnew things, it’s allowing you to think and consider things that weren’t obvious at first.\nReally creative people sometimes point out really obvious solutions that nobody put in\nthis particular context before.\nFull quote from Steve jobs “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative\npeople how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it,\nthey just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they\nwere able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the\nreason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have\nthought more about their experiences than other people. Unfortunately, that’s too rare a\ncommodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they\ndon’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a\nbroad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human\nexperience, the better design we will have.”\nSometimes the answer is obvious, but you won’t look past your imagination or mental\nlimits and roadblocks you put up or yourself\nSometimes we need to include other people who have more diverse experiences than\nwe do\nWe need to be open to alternative possibilities and not think in a linear way\nIDEATION\n3 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: What is Ideation? Why is it important? How do you do it?\nHave a discussion on the white board talking about a few of these points.\nIdeation is a creative process where the people involved generate ideas in a variety of\nways.\nIt is the third stage in the Design Thinking process.\nEntrepreneurs should aim to produce as many ideas as they can to address a problem\nstatement\nIdeation is a judgment-free environment open to silly and crazy ideas.\n\nCome up with innovative ideas\nIdentify new opportunities\nBring together the strengths of your team.\nCreate volume and variety of ideas\n10\nIDEATION WILL HELP YOU:\n3 minutes: Lecture\nIdeation will help you with:\nCome up with innovative ideas\nIdentify new opportunities\nBring together the strengths of your team.\nCreate volume and variety of ideas\nAsk: What else?\nAsk the right questions and innovate.\nStep beyond the obvious solutions and therefore increase the innovation potential of\nyour solution.\nGet obvious solutions out of your heads, and drive your team beyond those simple\nsolutions and into innovative ones.\n11\n1 minute: Lecture\nThrough creativity and ideation, you are turning messy problems and questions into\nsolutions and good ideas.\nThe answer might not seem obvious, but over time, it can become clearer and clearer.\nNow that we have our problem statements, the solution won’t be very difficult to come up\nwith.\n“It's not about coming up with the right idea, it’s about generating the broadest range of\npossibilities.”\n-Hasso Plattner\n1 minutes: Lecture\n“It's not about coming up with the ‘right’ idea, it’s about generating the broadest range of\npossibilities.”\n\nBefore we get into the brainstorming session, I want you to consider this quote.\nWe are going to set some ground rules to make sure that we are able to all of you\nleaving this session with a wide range of ideas and possibilities for your business.\nStart with “How Might We”\nNo judgement or criticism\nGo for weird, wacky and wild ideas\nConsider efficiency and costs\nQuantity over quality\nBe visual\nOne conversation at a time\nRULES\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\nAsk: Before we begin the brainstorm, we need to set some ground rules. As always, it\nwould be great to hear from you all first to see what rules you want to set for this\nbrainstorm.\nTake 3-5 minutes to listen to everyone's ideas and write them down on the whiteboard.\nGreat, I have a few additional rules that I would like to add as well to make sure the\nsession is really productive.\nStart with a problem statement (HMW): This is necessary to keep the team focused on\nthe right topic. Make sure that you have defined your need as a verb, otherwise you will\nface roadblocks early on in the brainstorm.\nThere is no judgement or criticism: Write down everything! There is no such thing as a\nbad idea. By being bold and curious, you can challenge commonly held beliefs and\nexplore possibilities past typically limited imagination.\nGo for weird, wacky and wild ideas: Even if these ideas seem ridiculous, it helps to break\ndown barriers and think more creatively. Additionally, there could be an element that is\napplicable in a “bad” or “crazy” idea. The most innovative ideas are often these\nunrealistic or wacky ideas.\nConsider efficiency and costs: How could this idea save resources or reduce expenses?\nQuantity over quality: Get as many as possible, try not to stop writing the whole time. By\nforcing yourself to go for quantity, you are reaching ideas that you would have never\neven considered.\nBuild on each others' ideas: Lets “Yes, and” this! Team members should take each\nothers’ ideas and build on them, find ways to link concepts, recognize patterns and flip\nseemingly impossible notions over to reveal new insights.\nBe visual: If you cant express your idea, no worries, draw them out or express them in\nanother way.\nOne conversation at a time: Don’t interrupt each other and let everyone on the team\nhave an opportunity to speak and put their ideas to paper.\nRecap: By following these rules, you are setting yourself up for a successful brainstorm!\n\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\n5-8 minutes: Brainstorm\nSo let’s do a quick example all together.\nHave a brainstorm with the class on how to solve this HMW statement “How might we\nhelp tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are worried about\nsafety and want to be in a good neighborhood”\nPotential answers could be:\nSharing pictures of hotel rooms\nGetting customer feedback\nRating systems\nHaving an application that shows restaurants, hotels, prices, tours, etc…\nCollecting information about all the hotels in the neighborhood/city/region in a database\nHave a transportation guide\nHave a security guide\nPush them to give crazier ideas\nWork with airlines to put hotels in the airports on the screens as tourists are arriving to\nfilter through options\nRent a house in a village where it is super cheap, but can be cool for a cultural visit\nEtc…\n2 minutes: Recap\nGreat, you just saw how we were able to generate so many ideas in just a few minutes.\nRemember there are no bad ideas and different perspectives help generate more ideas!\nWe were able to break through any judgement and have everyone feel comfortable to\nthrow out allow all kinds of ideas\nIt’s ok if you come up with “bad” ideas, because you never know who it might work for? –\nactually using bad ideas could be a great way to come up with good ones in some\ncases.\n16\nBRAINSTORM\n<1 minute: Explanation\nOk let’s get started!\nWe will spend the next 45 minutes brainstorming on the ideas of each other.\n\nEveryone should get into pairs. If there is an extra person, you can brainstorm with the\ntrainer (a group of 3 would throw off the timing).\nRAPID BRAINSTORMING\n15 minutes: Activity\nRapid brainstorming: We are going to start off with a rapid brainstorm.\nYou will have 3 minutes for both partners to brainstorm on one HMW statement.\nOnce those 3 minutes are up, do another 3 minutes on the same HMW statement. Push\nharder. Go deeper. Be crazier.\nAfter 1 partner gets 6 minutes on his/her HMW statement, switch attention to the second\nperson- Do the same thing for them.\nIf people are struggling, tell them that some answers could be solved by:\nThe trainer can share some ideas\nRemind them that any and all ideas are ok\nThink about crazy ideas\nImagine you were someone else, how would they solve the problem (a doctor, a teacher,\na politician, etc…)?\nWhen guiding brainstorming, encourage participants to consider:\nHow could this idea save money through smarter resource use?\nCould existing processes be optimized rather than creating new ones?\nWhat market trends might affect this solution?\nExample prompts if participants get stuck:\n\"What if you could cut operating costs in half?\"\n\"How could you do more with existing resources?\"\n\"What if key materials become more expensive?\"\n17\nSHARPENING YOUR BRAINSTORMING\nAs you refine your ideas, consider:\nCould this idea be more cost-effective by reducing resource use?\nCould it use materials that are cheaper and more available locally?\nCould it simplify operations by minimizing unnecessary waste?\nCould it offer a competitive advantage by being more efficient?\n18\n19\nBREAKING THE WALLS: “WHAT IF?” APPROACH\nWHAT IF?\n\n< 1 minute: Lecture\nGreat, rapid brainstorming is a great way to get a lot of ideas down on paper.\nWhat we are going to do now are “what if” brainstorms.\nWe will challenge some limitations we put on ourselves.\nBy breaking down these barriers, we allow ourselves to be more creative!\nWhen listing obstacles, consider:\nWhat if supply costs double?\nWhat if key resources become scarce?\nWhat if market preferences shift?\nFocus challenge discussions on:\nCost reduction opportunities\nResource optimization\nMarket adaptability\n$0\n10 minutes: Activity\n$0 brainstorm: Our first “What if” brainstorming approach is $0\nAsk: What if we had no money at all AND needed to reduce waste?

Take\none of the “How” ideas and go through these steps.\n\nStep 1: List out all the obstacles that are in the way. Remember that everything is a\nperspective. The one and only “truth” does not exist. Even this statement is a\nperspective – or a belief. Typical assumptions include:\nThat it is impossible to do something – particularly within constraints such as time and\ncost.\nThat something works because of certain rules or conditions.\nThat people believe, think, or need certain things.\nThink money, resources, connections, legal barriers, time, etc...\nStep 2: Challenge assumptions: Assume that you can overcome and challenge all\nassumptions. For each of those obstacles, consider what if that particular obstacles end\ngoal was actually possible\nAsk questions like “How could this be not true?” or “What if we could do this twice as well\nin half the time?”\nConsider if you could use an alternative resource\nIs there a way around the obstacle?\nCan you skip that step?\nStep 3: Find ways of making the challenge a reality: The real challenge is to make it\nhappen in reality.\nTest your solutions! If this is something really worth doing, make some steps to actually\ntry it out and see if it works!\nTest out any alternatives you identified and see if you could get around those obstacles.\n5 minutes: Lecture\nFirst principle story: Tell the story of Elon Musk as an example of how he challenges\nassumptions to create innovative businesses.\nHe uses the first principle theory to reevaluate problems by breaking challenges into its\nsimplest parts.\nHe uses this technique often when he faces barriers that might seem “impossible” to\novercome.\nElon Musk had a dream to get to space. To do this, he needed to buy rockets. He tried\nto buy rockets from the USA, but it was too expensive. He then went to Russia to see if\nthere were better options for him; however, they were still too expensive. He negotiated\nwith Russia 3 times to get rockets, but he had no success. He was really frustrated by\nthis, but refused to quit. He started to ask himself why he couldn’t build the rockets\nhimself. He asked, \"What if we build the rocket and the launch pad in a new way that\ncuts traditional costs for creating a rocket “. It sounds crazy to completely reinvent the\nrocket, but because he was able to ask those “what if” questions, it allowed him to\novercome the financial barrier that was stopping him. He held a series of brainstorming\nsessions to find the best way to break down and rebuild a rocket. He worked with his\nteam every week until they tackled the problem and found a cheaper way for creating\nrockets. He now has SpaceX and is changing the future of space exploration.\n\nMoral of the story is don’t let anything stop you. Break the problem down and find clever\nsolutions around barriers.\nAsk “what-if” questions to help break down those barriers.\nAsk: How can you guys apply this theory to your businesses? Is it relevant for you?\n30\nBRAIN WALKING\n5 minutes: Wrap up\nGreat job today everyone!\nMake sure that you keep all of your work up on the walls. We will come back after lunch\nand “brain walk”\nSometimes we need to step back after brainstorming to collect your thoughts and\nregroup.\nThis afternoon we will all go around and read through everyone's ideas and provide\nadditional feedback from the rest of the group.\nThis way you get more perspectives and hopefully more ideas!\nTHANK YOU!\nAny Questions?\n5.

Listen to\nthe group and write down everything they say on the board. Some answers could be:\nDo (experience what users experience)\nLook (observe users)\nListen (user interviews)\nEmpathy maps (way to reframe interviews: say, do, think, feel)\nExtreme users\nSurvey\nCompetitive benchmarking\nToday we will take the research we gathered last week and analyze and reframe our\nresearch into meaningful insights about our customers. Finally, we will map out their\njourney to identify areas of opportunity for your customers.\nYOUR RESEARCH:\nDO\nLOOK\nLISTEN\n2 minutes: Recap continued\nAfter they give their answers about the recap, touch base on anything they missed on\nthe Do, Look, Listen research plan.\nLast week, we created a research plan to help you better understand your customers.\nWe did this through the Do, Look, Listen methodology:\nDo is all about experiential learning. You should have put yourself in the shoes of your\ncustomers to experience the problem yourself,\nLook is learning through observation. You should have spent some time observing the\nbehaviors of your customers to pinpoint needs and opportunities.\nListen is where we talk to our customers through user interviews. You should have\nconducted at least 30 user interviews to try to get to the root of their problems and really\nunderstand their behaviors and emotions.\nBy doing the Do, Look, Listen research, you were able to really empathize with your\nusers and feel the problems they feel.\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\n\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nDefine the problem to have clear focus\nDiscussion: 3-5 minutes\nNow when we look back at the design thinking process, where are we now? After\ncompleting the EMPATHIZE phase, we are going to move on to DEFINE.\nWhy is it so important to define the problem of your customer?\nClear picture for the future of your product development\nKeep you on track to focus on the most important things\nKnow where you can best add value with your business\nRemind them that it is a continuous process that needs to be tested and re-evaluated\nagain and again.\nIn our next session, we will generate new ideas which are all your business\nopportunities,\n- Albert Einstein\n“If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem\nand 5 minutes thinking about solutions.”\n3 minutes: Discussion\nRead quote: “If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the\nproblem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions”\nAsk: What do you guys think of this statement? Some comments could be:\nIt is necessary to lay the proper groundwork before attempting to solve a problem\nYou need to pinpoint the real problem, otherwise you can be misguided while solving it\nDefining the problem makes sure that we understand it\nSo many times people just want to jump to conclusions or solutions without making sure\nthey are the RIGHT solutions\nEssentially, when you are problem solving, the most difficult part is identifying the real\nchallenge. Once you are able to have a clear problem, the solution is easy!\nDEFINE AND REFRAME\n“A problem well put is half solved.”\n-John Dewey\n2 minutes: Lecture\nWhat we are going to focus on for the rest of the session is making sure our problem is\nwell defined. Once we have a clear definition, finding the solutions will be easy.\n\nThis process of trying to define the problem takes longer and is more difficult than finding\nthe solution\nYou will see in the ideation session how many possible solutions if you have a clear\nstatement; however, if you don’t take the time to define a problem statement for each of\nyour segments, the ideation will be much harder.\nUser personas\nCustomer journey map\nProblem statement\nANALYZE USER RESEARCH\n2 minutes: Lecture\nSo how should we reframe the data we have collected to find a clear problem to solve?\nWe will form the problem in 3 steps:\nUser personas: Based off of the trends we find from our research, we will make user\npersonas for each group. We will look at these groups as if they were real people with\nreal emotions and problems. (40 minutes)\nCustomer Journey Map: We will take these personas and map out their typical journey\ntrying to solve a problem, (50 minutes)\nProblem statement: And then we will take that information and create a problem\nstatement for each persona. This will be the basis for us to begin to find creative\nsolutions. (Next class)\nWHO ARE YOUR USERS?\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\nCustomers are the driving force of your business. Without them, you wouldn’t exist.\nThat’s why you need to spend the time to develop a deep understanding of your\ncustomers’ thinking. Over the past 2 weeks, you have done a lot of research. The idea is\nto put yourself in your customers’ shoes—their minds, really.\nYou want to figure out their perception of your company.\nCreating an accurate customer persona can help you accomplish this.\nIt will help you learn about their habits, behaviors, and interests.\nThat way, you’ll be able to market to them accordingly.\nYour research included:\nUser research: During your user research, you should have gotten a clear idea of who\nyour customers are and what their current journey looks like. What are the pains and\nstruggles they are facing? This is a lot of rich qualitative data.\nEmpathy maps: You then plotted that information on empathy maps. Making sure to\ninclude quotes from your customers, thoughts and feelings they had, and also writing\ntheir process down.\n\nSurvey: Finally, you all have some survey data (who got 1000 respondents?!). Here you\ncan look at people’s needs from a quantitative perspective.\nPICTURE & NAME\nDEMOGRAPHIC:\nGEOGRAPHIC:\nBEHAVIORAL:\nPSYCHOGRAPHIC:\n5 minutes: Discussion (discussion continues on next slide)\nAsk: Do you guys remember what each of these elements are? What do each of these\nthings mean and what could go into these categories? Explain the elements of creating\nyour persona.\nGeographic: Location, city, reach, country, international vs local\nDemographic: Age, gender, family size, income, ethnic background\nBehavioral: Patterns, usage rates,\nPsychographic: Social class, lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes,\nPicture and name: You should try to make this as real as possible. Give this person a\nname. What do they look like? Draw them out as well or find a picture that represents\nthem.\nCUSTOMER GOALS:\nCUSTOMER PAINS:\nCUSTOMER STORY:\nContinue to explain the elements of creating a persona.\nCustomer goals: What is this person trying to achieve? What do they care about?\nCustomer pains: What are the challenges they face while trying to achieve their goal?\nWhat makes their life difficult?\n\nCustomer story: Tell this person’s story. Sum up all the information into a paragraph.\nRemember, make sure it relates to your business!\n30 minutes: User persona activity\n20 minutes: activity\nEveryone should take out their empathy maps, interview notes, and survey data. We will\nrefer to this information to try and spot trends and group people in similar categories.\nWhich categories of people are facing similar challenges? Whose needs are the same?\nPut everyone in similar categories together and create a persona for that group\nYou can make several of these groups if you have identified different groups. Ignore\npeople who don’t fit into a group for now. Although their needs are important to consider,\nthey could be an outlier whose needs are very different from the majority. Your product\ncan’t be for everyone. Instead focus on your most promising customer segments.\nEveryone should now fill out user personas for their business. We want you to be really\nspecific. Find an example of a real person who might use your product/service. Describe\nthem like they are real. Your customers will be real people with needs, values, and\nfeelings.\n5-10 minutes: Share\nAsk 1-2 people to share their person.\nProvide some feedback\nUser personas\nCustomer journey map\nProblem statement\nANALYZE USER RESEARCH\n<1 minute: Transition\nOk, so we have created user personas, now we will move onto our CJM to identify gaps\nand opportunities.\nWHY SHOULD YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR USERS JOURNEY?\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nA customer (or user) journey map is a detailed record of a customer’s experience of\ndoing something. The journey covers three parts, before – during – after. This should be\nput in the context of a potential customer trying to accomplish something related to your\nbusiness.\nAsk: Why should you understand your users journey.\nTo know what the users go through while they try to meet their needs.\nCut down transaction cost by making our business easy and for our customers.\n\nA customer journey map can help you build empathy towards your users as you try to\nexperience\nWhat they go through. It can also uncover insights, such as when you compare journeys\nbetween customers to find common threads or find conflicting behaviors within a\ncustomer’s journey.\n“A successful customer journey map will give you real insight into what your customers\nwant and any parts of your product, brand or process that aren’t delivering.”\nHOW CAN WE BUILD A PERFECT CJM?\nTime\n10 minutes: Brainstorm\nGroup example: Go through an example of building a customer journey on the board.\nStep 1: Choose one of your personas\nStep 2: Put that persona in a situation\nStep 3: Go through the whole process that a potential customer (one of the personas)\ncurrently goes through to go through that situation.\nThe trainer can do the tourism agency business (which is described below) or another\nexample that the trainer would like to do.\nCreate the bell curve and do an example with the class.\nTourism agency example:\nChoose persona: Christine, a university student from California, USA.\nChoose situation: She is looking to go on vacation to Germany with a group of friends.\nDefine their process: Point by point, draw out on the bell curve the steps that Christine\nwould go through to go on her trip with her friends. Fill it in by asking the group what they\nthink the steps would be. Trainer tip: Make sure to leave spaces to go back and fill in any\npoints you think they have missed.\nYou should include the whole process from beginning to end. This can include:\nDeciding to go on vacation. Gets really excited and pumped up!\nSearching online to learn more about places to go in Germany. Very overwhelming\nbecause of all the options!\nResearching hotels and flights. Trying to find the cheapest place but in a good location.\nGoing back and forth with friends to decide on the trip (sharing links, getting ideas,\nsharing opinions). Nothing is organized and we seem to be planning different trips\ntogether!\nBooking the hotel, flights, trip activities, etc… It was very difficult to keep track of all the\noptions, but she finally got the right options and is happy to be finished!\nLeave for the airport. Maybe your persona is always late and misses her flight or is stuck\nin traffic.\nArrives and gets to the hotel to unwind (did anything major happen here? Did she get\nlost because she doesn’t speak German?)\n\nShe has an amazing trip. Visited 3 cities in Germany and did a lot of adventure activities.\nGood thing they planned everything well in advance, because booking new things is\nconfusing because of the language barrier.\nWent home and posted pictures all over social media\nWrote many reviews on all of her good/bad experiences while traveling.\nMake sure to highlight areas that the persona had strong emotions. When were they\nupset or frustrated? When were they happy or excited? Did they have any other\nemotions?\nYou can draw a face to represent the emotions at each step if it is easier to visualize it\nthat way.\nScenario & objectives\nStep by step process\nGoals and behaviors\nEmotions and thoughts\nMonetize\nCUSTOMER JOURNEY STEPS:\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\nThrough the personas and CJM, you should highlight the following. We already talked\nabout some of them, but highlight them again and add to any points that were missed:\nScenario & objectives: End goal of the customer and a description of what they are\ndoing.\nStep by step process: The actual steps that they go through to achieve their end\nobjective\nGoals and behaviors: Goals for each step on the user journey. What do they want to\nachieve at this step?\nEmotions and thoughts: In reality, how do the customers feel at this step? Which parts\nmake them happy, frustrated, or sad?\nMonetize: How can you make money or add value to your customers at each step? Be\nopen to adding crazy, unique, or different ideas.\nAsk: Before we apply it to your business, let’s talk quickly about why the CJM is good for\nthe future of your projects?\nWe can now see the current struggles to avoid them in our products/services.\nSee what makes your customers really happy to make sure to include that element in\nyour business\nReduce mistakes in your business (focus on the right things)\nBy looking at each step of the user journey, you will identify new opportunities that you\ncan take advantage of.\n\nRemember that each step that makes the users sad, frustrated, or angry is an\nopportunity for you.\nIf there are any solutions that come to your mind during this activity, write them here.\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nCUSTOMER JOURNEY MAP:\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\n\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\n\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\n\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\n\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\n\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\n20 minutes: Activity\nNow it is time to apply this to your individual business ideas!\nYou can do this on flipchart paper, or work on this worksheet\nExplain the worksheet briefly simply restating the elements you have already mentioned\npreviously (you can go through the slides to reiterate.\nYou should have emailed it the day before so they already have it and can work directly\nin it.\nFocus on one persona for now and make sure to be detailed for that specific customer\ntype!\nTell them that they will create one of these for each of their personas on their own time.\nTell them to feel free to do this outside of the class or wherever they are comfortable\nThe trainer should be walking around the room to help them or answer any questions.\nQuestions that might come up:\nHow detailed should we be? Be as detailed as possible; however, make sure everything\nis relevant for your business (the journey your customers currently go on to accomplish\ntheir task). Be more detailed in areas that are important to your customer or where there\nwere strong emotions from them.\nI don’t know my customers’ journey, what should I do? You should go back and continue\nwith your user research! You need to know your customer deeply! This means their\npains, gains, daily habits, and processes.\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nCreate your user personas\nMap your personas stories on a Journey Map!\n5 minutes: Wrap up & questions\nGreat job today guys! I know we did a lot, and it was a bit heavy, but I hope you found it\nuseful and you have really clarified the challenges that your customers are facing. You\ncan actually take your personas and CJM and validate it by showing it to your customer\nto see if it is true or not. Of course it won’t be true for everyone, but it could give you an\nidea if you are on the right track.\nHome research:\n\nWhat I want you to do for the rest of the day is actually create really thought through user\npersonas, customer journey maps, and How Might We problem statements for each.\nPlease work on the template we have shared with you and submit this to all of the\ntrainers online.\nIn the next session, we will go into How Might We statements again and go into creativity\nand ideation to generate many different solutions for these problems.\nTHANK YOU!\nfiveonelabs.org\nUser personas\nCustomer journey map\nProblem statement\nANALYZE USER RESEARCH\n1 minute: Transition\nBased on the personas you have created, and their journey map we are now going to\ndefine problem statements.\nAn integral part of the design thinking process is the definition of a meaningful and\nactionable problem statement. This problem statement will be the focus when beginning\nproblem solving. This is perhaps the most challenging part of the Design Thinking\nprocess. It is difficult; however, if you have done enough research, created your user\npersonas, and went over their journey, it is not hard at all!\nHow might we help\n(our customers) (need as a verb),\nkeeping in mind (info about our customers).\nHOW MIGHT WE…\n10 minutes: Explanation/discussion\nA “How Might We” statement is a meaningful and actionable problem statement, which\nwill allow you to ideate in a goal-oriented manner. Your HMW captures your design\nvision by defining the RIGHT challenge to address in the ideation sessions. This involves\nreframing a design challenge into an actionable problem statement. You articulate a\nHMW statement by combining your knowledge about the user you are designing for, his\nor her needs and the insights which you’ve come to know in your research or Empathise\nmode.\nNow lets make a How Might We statement for the tourism agency business:\nDo this together on the board\nAllow them to develop the HMW statement for the tourism agency business\nStep 1: Define your customer (which persona are you focusing on?)\n\nStep 2: What is that personas need? Remember to focus on needs as verbs to ensure a\nvariety of solutions are possible\nStep 3: Write an insight about them\nSome answers they might end up with include:\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\nHow might we help local tourists find and book inexpensive vacations for their families\nkeeping in mind they always look for recommendations from family and friends because\nthey don’t trust the agencies.\nRemind the class that this information should be based off of their research. The\nexample we are giving might not be true because we don’t have any evidence to prove\nthis.\n----------\nHere is some more information about HMW statements:\nIdeation sessions require dedicated environments for standing back to seek every angle\nafter addressing the right problem. So Before starting to look for ideas, your team needs\na clearly defined problem to tackle – a focused problem statement to inspire and guide\neveryone.\nYour HMW should be an actionable problem statement that will drive the rest of your\ndesign work.\n(HMW) questions are questions that have the potential to spark ideation sessions such\nas brainstorms. They should be broad enough for a wide range of solutions, but narrow\nenough that specific solutions can be created for them. “How Might We” questions\nshould be based on the observations you’ve gathered in the Empathise stage of the\nDesign Thinking process.\nFor example, you have observed that youths tend to not watch TV programs on the TV\nat home, some questions which can guide and spark your ideation session could be:\nHow might we make TV more social, so youths feel more engaged?\nHow might we enable TV programs to be watched anywhere, at anytime?\nHow might we make watching TV at home more exciting?\nThe HMW questions open up to Ideation sessions where you explore ideas, which can\nhelp you solve your design challenge in an innovative way.\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\nGo over another example\n\nAfter you have created the HMW statement together, show them this one as another\nexample.\nBy defining a “How might we…?” question, you are able to clearly define the problem for\nyour user and this will help prompt an effective pathway towards potential solutions.\n15 minutes: Activity HMW statements\n15 minutes: Create HMW statement\nNow, what we are going to do is create HMW statements for each of your user personas\nthat you have created.\nEach persona should have their own HMW statement based on their individual needs\nThey will spend the rest of the class doing this.\nMake sure to go around the room and help. Remember to define needs as VERBS!\nWe will review these HMW statements in the next session so please come prepared with\nthem for each persona.\nUPDATED COPY OF REFRAME\nReframe: Define the problem\nDESIGN THINKING\n----\nAgenda for this session:\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Begin the session\n9:35 | Analyze user research (user personas, CJM, problem statement)\nUser personas (40 minutes)\n5-10 minutes: Explanation/discussion\n20 minutes: Apply to business\n5-10 minutes: Share and feedback\n10:15 | Break\n10:30 | Analyze user research (continued)\nCustomer Journey Map (50 minutes)\n5-10 minutes: Explanation/discussion\n10 minutes: Group example\n20 minutes: Apply to business\n5-10 minutes: Share and feedback\n11:40 - 12:00 | Wrap up & questions\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\nTea/coffee\nAnswer entrepreneur questions\n\nGive any updates or announcements\nBefore we get started, lets just go around the room and share briefly about our past\nweek:\nHow many survey respondents did you get?\nHow many user interviews did you do?\nDid you learn anything new or insightful about your customers or business?\nSpend some time to address challenges the group has faced and share best practices\nthat the entrepreneurs have found\n9:15 | Begin the session\nGood morning everyone!\nSo today, we are going to take all that research you’ve done, and reframe it into\nmeaningful information to help define our customers problems so we can actually create\nour business based on THEIR NEEDS instead of what we think their needs are.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES:\nAnalyze and reframe your user research.\nCreate your real user personas.\nMap out your user’s journey to identify areas of opportunity!\n1 minute: Objectives\nAnalyze and reframe your user research: We will first take a look at the data you have\ncollected, analyze it, and reframe to find meaningful trends.\nCreate your real user personas: Next, we will use that data to create REAL user\npersonas (remember last time how me made FAKE personas)\nMap out your users journey to identify areas of opportunity: Finally, we will take those\npersonas, map out their behaviors to identify opportunities and clarify a clear problem\nstatement for each persona.\nLET’S\n5 minute: Discussion\nRecap from the previous week.\nAsk: Can someone tell us what we have done in terms of our research plan?

Some answers could be:\nDo (experience what users experience)\nLook (observe users)\nListen (user interviews)\n\nEmpathy maps (way to reframe interviews: say, do, think, feel)\nExtreme users\nSurvey\nCompetitive benchmarking\nToday we will take the research we gathered last week and analyze and reframe our\nresearch into meaningful insights about our customers. Finally, we will map out their\njourney to identify areas of opportunity for your customers.\nYOUR RESEARCH:\nDO\nLOOK\nLISTEN\n2 minutes: Recap continued\nAfter they give their answers about the recap, touch base on anything they missed on\nthe Do, Look, Listen research plan.\nLast week, we created a research plan to help you better understand your customers.\nWe did this through the Do, Look, Listen methodology:\nDo is all about experiential learning. You should have put yourself in the shoes of your\ncustomers to experience the problem yourself,\nLook is learning through observation. You should have spent some time observing the\nbehaviors of your customers to pinpoint needs and opportunities.\nListen is where we talk to our customers through user interviews. You should have\nconducted at least 30 user interviews to try to get to the root of their problems and really\nunderstand their behaviors and emotions.\nBy doing the Do, Look, Listen research, you were able to really empathize with your\nusers and feel the problems they feel.\nEncourage participants to reflect on how factors like resource availability or external risks\nimpact their users' pain points and how these considerations shape business\nopportunities.\nAsk: \"What external factors—such as economic changes, environmental conditions, or\nshifts in resource availability—have you noticed influencing your users' behaviors and\ndecisions?”\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\n\nDefine the problem to have clear focus\nDiscussion: 3-5 minutes\nNow when we look back at the design thinking process, where are we now? After\ncompleting the EMPATHIZE phase, we are going to move on to DEFINE.\nWhy is it so important to define the problem of your customer?\nClear picture for the future of your product development\nKeep you on track to focus on the most important things\nKnow where you can best add value with your business\nRemind them that it is a continuous process that needs to be tested and re-evaluated\nagain and again.\nIn our next session, we will generate new ideas which are all your business\nopportunities,\n- Albert Einstein\n“If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem\nand 5 minutes thinking about solutions.”\n3 minutes: Discussion\nRead quote: “If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the\nproblem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions”\nAsk: What do you guys think of this statement? Some comments could be:\nIt is necessary to lay the proper groundwork before attempting to solve a problem\nYou need to pinpoint the real problem, otherwise you can be misguided while solving it.\nDefining the problem makes sure that we understand it\nSo many times people just want to jump to conclusions or solutions without making sure\nthey are the RIGHT solutions\nEssentially, when you are problem solving, the most difficult part is identifying the real\nchallenge. Once you are able to have a clear problem, the solution is easy!\nDEFINE AND REFRAME\n“A problem well put is half solved.”\n-John Dewey\n2 minutes: Lecture\nWhat we are going to focus on for the rest of the session is making sure our problem is\nwell defined. Once we have a clear definition, finding the solutions will be easy.\nThis process of trying to define the problem takes longer and is more difficult than finding\nthe solution\nYou will see in the ideation session how many possible solutions if you have a clear\nstatement; however, if you don’t take the time to define a problem statement for each of\nyour segments, the ideation will be much harder.\n\nA well-defined problem also helps in reducing risks, improving efficiency, and ensuring\nbusiness resilience.\nUser personas\nCustomer journey map\nProblem statement\nANALYZE USER RESEARCH\n2 minutes: Lecture\nSo how should we reframe the data we have collected to find a clear problem to solve?\nWe will form the problem in 3 steps:\nUser personas: Based off of the trends we find from our research, we will make user\npersonas for each group. We will look at these groups as if they were real people with\nreal emotions and problems. (40 minutes)\nCustomer Journey Map: We will take these personas and map out their typical journey\ntrying to solve a problem, (50 minutes)\nProblem statement: And then we will take that information and create a problem\nstatement for each persona. This will be the basis for us to begin to find creative\nsolutions. (Next class)\nWHO ARE YOUR USERS?\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\nCustomers are the driving force of your business. Without them, you wouldn’t exist.\nThat’s why you need to spend the time to develop a deep understanding of your\ncustomers’ thinking. Over the past 2 weeks, you have done a lot of research. The idea is\nto put yourself in your customers’ shoes—their minds, really.\nYou want to figure out their perception of your company.\nCreating an accurate customer persona can help you accomplish this.\nIt will help you learn about their habits, behaviors, and interests.\nThat way, you’ll be able to market to them accordingly.\nYour research included:\nUser research: During your user research, you should have gotten a clear idea of who\nyour customers are and what their current journey looks like. What are the pains and\nstruggles they are facing? This is a lot of rich qualitative data.\nEmpathy maps: You then plotted that information on empathy maps. Making sure to\ninclude quotes from your customers, thoughts and feelings they had, and also writing\ntheir process down.\nSurvey: Finally, you all have some survey data (who got 1000 respondents?!). Here you\ncan look at people’s needs from a quantitative perspective.\n\nPICTURE & NAME\nTAGLINE:\nDEMOGRAPHIC:\nGEOGRAPHIC:\nBEHAVIORAL:\nPSYCHOGRAPHIC:\n5 minutes: Discussion (discussion continues on next slide)\nAsk: Do you guys remember what each of these elements are? What do each of these\nthings mean and what could go into these categories? Explain the elements of creating\nyour persona.\nTagline: a short phrase that describes you\nGeographic: Location, city, reach, country, international vs local. Access to reliable\nenergy or water availability?\nDemographic: Age, gender, family size, income, ethnic background\nBehavioral: Patterns, usage rates, cost vs sustainability trade-offs?\nPsychographic: Social class, lifestyle, personality, values, attitudes. Do they seek\nenergy-efficient or resource-saving solutions?\nPicture and name: You should try to make this as real as possible. Give this person a\nname. What do they look like? Draw them out as well or find a picture that represents\nthem.\nGOALS & MOTIVATIONS:\nUSER STORY:\nPAINS & CHALLENGES:\nMARKET & BUSINESS FACTORS\nCustomer Preferences\nCost Considerations\nResource & Efficiency Factors\nSustainability & Green Factors\nExternal Factors & Resilience\nContinue to explain the elements of creating a persona.\nGoals & Motivations: What is this person trying to accomplish?\nPains & Challenges: What problems does this person face related to your solution?\n\nMarket & Business Factors (This is where we connect the persona to real-world\nbusiness considerations.):\nCustomer Preferences: What features, qualities, or services does this person value\nmost? How do they make purchasing decisions?\nCost Considerations: How price-sensitive is this person? What factors might justify a\npremium price for them?\nResource & Efficiency Factors: How do concerns about resource use, operational costs,\nor efficiency affect this person's decisions?\nSustainability & Green Factors: How does this person consider environmental\nsustainability in their choices? Are they concerned with eco-friendly products, energy\nuse, waste reduction, or circular economy principles?\nExternal Factors & Resilience: What external conditions (market shifts, resource\navailability, energy costs) affect this person's business or purchasing decisions?\nUser Story: Sum up this person’s experience in a short narrative\n30 minutes: User persona activity\n20 minutes: activity\nEveryone should take out their empathy maps, interview notes, and survey data. We will\nrefer to this information to try and spot trends and group people in similar categories.\nWhich categories of people are facing similar challenges? Whose needs are the same?\nPut everyone in similar categories together and create a persona for that group\nYou can make several of these groups if you have identified different groups. Ignore\npeople who don’t fit into a group for now. Although their needs are important to consider,\nthey could be an outlier whose needs are very different from the majority. Your product\ncan’t be for everyone. Instead focus on your most promising customer segments.\nEveryone should now fill out user personas for their business. We want you to be really\nspecific. Find an example of a real person who might use your product/service. Describe\nthem like they are real. Your customers will be real people with needs, values, and\nfeelings.\n5-10 minutes: Share\nAsk 1-2 people to share their person.\nProvide some feedback\nUser personas\nCustomer journey map\nProblem statement\nANALYZE USER RESEARCH\n<1 minute: Transition\nOk, so we have created user personas, now we will move onto our CJM to identify gaps\nand opportunities.\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR USERS JOURNEY?\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nA customer (or user) journey map is a detailed record of a customer’s experience of\ndoing something. The journey covers three parts, before – during – after. This should be\nput in the context of a potential customer trying to accomplish something related to your\nbusiness.\nAsk: Why should you understand your users journey.\nTo know what the users go through while they try to meet their needs.\nCut down transaction cost by making our business easy and for our customers.\nA customer journey map can help you build empathy towards your users as you try to\nexperience\nWhat they go through. It can also uncover insights, such as when you compare journeys\nbetween customers to find common threads or find conflicting behaviors within a\ncustomer’s journey.\nIdentifying areas of inefficiency allows businesses to optimize operations, ensuring\nresilience against external uncertainties.\n“A successful customer journey map will give you real insight into what your customers\nwant and any parts of your product, brand or process that aren’t delivering.”\nHOW CAN WE BUILD A PERFECT CJM?\nTime\n10 minutes: Brainstorm\nGroup example: Go through an example of building a customer journey on the board.\nStep 1: Choose one of your personas\nStep 2: Put that persona in a situation\nStep 3: Go through the whole process that a potential customer (one of the personas)\ncurrently goes through to go through that situation.\nThe trainer can do the tourism agency business (which is described below) or another\nexample that the trainer would like to do.\nCreate the bell curve and do an example with the class.\nTourism agency example:\nChoose persona: Christine, a university student from California, USA.\nChoose situation: She is looking to go on vacation to Germany with a group of friends.\nDefine their process: Point by point, draw out on the bell curve the steps that Christine\nwould go through to go on her trip with her friends. Fill it in by asking the group what they\nthink the steps would be. Trainer tip: Make sure to leave spaces to go back and fill in any\npoints you think they have missed.\n\nYou should include the whole process from beginning to end. This can include:\nDeciding to go on vacation. Gets really excited and pumped up!\nSearching online to learn more about places to go in Germany. Very overwhelming\nbecause of all the options!\nResearching hotels and flights. Trying to find the cheapest place but in a good location.\nGoing back and forth with friends to decide on the trip (sharing links, getting ideas,\nsharing opinions). Nothing is organized and we seem to be planning different trips\ntogether!\nBooking the hotel, flights, trip activities, etc… It was very difficult to keep track of all the\noptions, but she finally got the right options and is happy to be finished!\nLeave for the airport. Maybe your persona is always late and misses her flight or is stuck\nin traffic.\nArrives and gets to the hotel to unwind (did anything major happen here? Did she get\nlost because she doesn’t speak German?)\nShe has an amazing trip. Visited 3 cities in Germany and did a lot of adventure activities.\nGood thing they planned everything well in advance, because booking new things is\nconfusing because of the language barrier.\nWent home and posted pictures all over social media\nWrote many reviews on all of her good/bad experiences while traveling.\nMake sure to highlight areas that the persona had strong emotions. When were they\nupset or frustrated? When were they happy or excited? Did they have any other\nemotions?\nYou can draw a face to represent the emotions at each step if it is easier to visualize it\nthat way.\nScenario & objectives\nStep by step process\nGoals and behaviors\nEmotions and thoughts\nMonetize\nCUSTOMER JOURNEY STEPS:\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\nThrough the personas and CJM, you should highlight the following. We already talked\nabout some of them, but highlight them again and add to any points that were missed:\nScenario & objectives: End goal of the customer and a description of what they are\ndoing.\nStep by step process: The actual steps that they go through to achieve their end\nobjective\nGoals and behaviors: Goals for each step on the user journey. What do they want to\nachieve at this step?\n\nEmotions and thoughts: In reality, how do the customers feel at this step? Which parts\nmake them happy, frustrated, or sad?\nMonetize: How can you make money or add value to your customers at each step? Be\nopen to adding crazy, unique, or different ideas.\nAsk: Before we apply it to your business, let’s talk quickly about why the CJM is good for\nthe future of your projects?\nWe can now see the current struggles to avoid them in our products/services.\nSee what makes your customers really happy to make sure to include that element in\nyour business\nReduce mistakes in your business (focus on the right things)\nBy looking at each step of the user journey, you will identify new opportunities that you\ncan take advantage of.\nRemember that each step that makes the users sad, frustrated, or angry is an\nopportunity for you.\nIf there are any solutions that come to your mind during this activity, write them here.\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\nDemographics:\nStoryboard pic\nStoryboard pic\nStoryboard pic\nStoryboard pic\nStoryboard pic\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nValues & Information Needs\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nCUSTOMER JOURNEY MAP:\n20 minutes: Activity\n\nNow it is time to apply this to your individual business ideas!\nYou can do this on flipchart paper, or work on this worksheet\nExplain the worksheet briefly simply restating the elements you have already mentioned\npreviously (you can go through the slides to reiterate.\nYou should have emailed it the day before so they already have it and can work directly\nin it.\nFocus on one persona for now and make sure to be detailed for that specific customer\ntype!\nTell them that they will create one of these for each of their personas on their own time.\nTell them to feel free to do this outside of the class or wherever they are comfortable\nThe trainer should be walking around the room to help them or answer any questions.\nQuestions that might come up:\nHow detailed should we be? Be as detailed as possible; however, make sure everything\nis relevant for your business (the journey your customers currently go on to accomplish\ntheir task). Be more detailed in areas that are important to your customer or where there\nwere strong emotions from them.\nI don’t know my customers’ journey, what should I do? You should go back and continue\nwith your user research! You need to know your customer deeply! This means their\npains, gains, daily habits, and processes.\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nCreate your user personas\nMap your personas stories on a Journey Map!\n5 minutes: Wrap up & questions\nGreat job today guys! I know we did a lot, and it was a bit heavy, but I hope you found it\nuseful and you have really clarified the challenges that your customers are facing. You\ncan actually take your personas and CJM and validate it by showing it to your customer\nto see if it is true or not. Of course it won’t be true for everyone, but it could give you an\nidea if you are on the right track.\nHome research:\nWhat I want you to do for the rest of the day is actually create really thought through user\npersonas, customer journey maps, and How Might We problem statements for each.\nPlease work on the template we have shared with you and submit this to all of the\ntrainers online.\nIn the next session, we will go into How Might We statements again and go into creativity\nand ideation to generate many different solutions for these problems.\nTHANK YOU!\n\nfiveonelabs.org\nUser personas\nCustomer journey map\nProblem statement\nANALYZE USER RESEARCH\n1 minute: Transition\nBased on the personas you have created, and their journey map we are now going to\ndefine problem statements.\nAn integral part of the design thinking process is the definition of a meaningful and\nactionable problem statement. This problem statement will be the focus when beginning\nproblem solving. This is perhaps the most challenging part of the Design Thinking\nprocess. It is difficult; however, if you have done enough research, created your user\npersonas, and went over their journey, it is not hard at all!\nHow might we help\n(our customers) (need as a verb),\nkeeping in mind (info about our customers)\nHOW MIGHT WE…\n10 minutes: Explanation/discussion\nA “How Might We” statement is a meaningful and actionable problem statement, which\nwill allow you to ideate in a goal-oriented manner. Your HMW captures your design\nvision by defining the RIGHT challenge to address in the ideation sessions. This involves\nreframing a design challenge into an actionable problem statement. You articulate a\nHMW statement by combining your knowledge about the user you are designing for, his\nor her needs and the insights which you’ve come to know in your research or Empathise\nmode.\nNow lets make a How Might We statement for the tourism agency business:\nDo this together on the board\nAllow them to develop the HMW statement for the tourism agency business\nStep 1: Define your customer (which persona are you focusing on?)\nStep 2: What is that personas need? Remember to focus on needs as verbs to ensure a\nvariety of solutions are possible\nStep 3: Write an insight about them\nSome answers they might end up with include:\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\n\nHow might we help local tourists find and book inexpensive sustainable, vacations for\ntheir families, keeping in mind they always look for recommendations from family and\nfriends? Because they don’t trust the agencies.\nRemind the class that this information should be based off of their research. The\nexample we are giving might not be true because we don’t have any evidence to prove\nthis.\n----------\nHere is some more information about HMW statements:\nIdeation sessions require dedicated environments for standing back to seek every angle\nafter addressing the right problem. So Before starting to look for ideas, your team needs\na clearly defined problem to tackle – a focused problem statement to inspire and guide\neveryone.\nYour HMW should be an actionable problem statement that will drive the rest of your\ndesign work.\n(HMW) questions are questions that have the potential to spark ideation sessions such\nas brainstorms. They should be broad enough for a wide range of solutions, but narrow\nenough that specific solutions can be created for them. “How Might We” questions\nshould be based on the observations you’ve gathered in the Empathise stage of the\nDesign Thinking process.\nFor example, you have observed that youths tend to not watch TV programs on the TV\nat home, some questions which can guide and spark your ideation session could be:\nHow might we make TV more social, so youths feel more engaged?\nHow might we enable TV programs to be watched anywhere, at anytime?\nHow might we make watching TV at home more exciting?\nThe HMW questions open up to Ideation sessions where you explore ideas, which can\nhelp you solve your design challenge in an innovative way.\nHow might we help tourists visiting Kurdistan find cheap hotels, keeping in mind they are\nworried about safety and want to be in a good neighborhood.\nGo over another example\nAfter you have created the HMW statement together, show them this one as another\nexample.\nBy defining a “How might we…?” question, you are able to clearly define the problem for\nyour user and this will help prompt an effective pathway towards potential solutions.\n15 minutes: Activity HMW statements\n15 minutes: Create HMW statement\n\nNow, what we are going to do is create HMW statements for each of your user personas\nthat you have created.\nEach persona should have their own HMW statement based on their individual needs\nThey will spend the rest of the class doing this.\nMake sure to go around the room and help. Remember to define needs as VERBS!\nWe will review these HMW statements in the next session so please come prepared with\nthem for each persona.\n7. The Pitch\nORIGINAL VERSION\nTHE PITCH\nHOW TO CONVEY YOUR BUSINESS IDEA IN 3 MINUTES OR LESS\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Best practices\n10:00 | Break\n10:15 | The pitch\n11:00 | Build your pitch!\n11:45 - 12:00 | Wrap up\n----\n9:00 Settle in\nTea/coffee\nCheck in, give updates or news\nGo around the room and share progress\nAnswer any questions about the feasibility study or ending the program\n9:30 Begin the session\nToday during, we are going to talk about your pitch!\nTodays session will be all about communicating you business idea in in any situation.\n1\nCommunicate your business in a variety of situations.\nLearn pitching best practices.\nBuild out your pitch deck.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES\n\n1 minute: Objectives\nCommunicate your business in a variety of situations.\nLearn pitching best practices.\nBuild out your pitch deck.\n2\nSTORY-TELLING\n15 minutes: Activity + discussion\n7 minutes: Activity\nBefore we get started, we are going to look at the idea of story telling.\nEveryone should find a partner. If there is an odd number, use another trainer.\nEach person is going to get 3 minutes to tell a story. It can be something funny, a favorite\nchildhood story, or anything else (except about your business).\nSet the timer for 3 minutes for one person, then switch to give 3 minutes for the second\nperson.\n8 minutes: Discussion\nWho heard a good story? What made it a good story? What really worked well? Was\nthere anything that wasn’t so good? Why?\nWrite answers on the board\nSome potential answers that might come up:\nIt was funny, sad, happy, scary, etc… (Was good because it connected with you\nemotionally)\nIt was relatable (you could empathize with the person in the story)\nIt was meaningful (had a purpose, or moral)\nI learned something (had a purpose, or moral)\nIt is about something I care about (engaging)\nEtc…\nWas there anything that you didn’t like?\nI didn’t understand the point of the story\nI didn’t get the backstory so couldn’t relate\nI wasn’t interested in the topic\n3\nTension\nIntro\nMoral\nTime\nTension\nTELL A STORY!\n\nClimax\n5 minutes: Lecture\nAll of those points you brought up are right. There is a lot that goes into a great story.\nGreat stories typically follow this framework which includes many of the points that you\nalready brought up.\nThere is an introduction, background and a setting is provided.\nThere is a build up. Tension connects with you on some type of emotional level.\nThen something happens! (climax)\nAnd then you wrap the story up with some type of moral or purpose.\nWhy is storytelling an important skill when thinking about your pitch?\nA pitch is just a story!\nIntroduction: Introduce yourself and your business idea. What is the problem you have\nidentified?\nTension: Give some more information. How big is this problem? Why so many people\nneed your solution. Connect with people emotionally here!\nClimax: We can solve it! Tell us about your amazing idea here. How does it solve the\nproblem?\nMoral: This is what we need. Your pitch should have an ending or some type of\nconclusion. This can be a moral, an ask, or a call to action.\n4\nKNOW YOUR AUDIENCE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nHow you choose to tell your story shouldn’t always be exactly the same way. There are\nother factors that go into great storytelling that would impact your delivery.\nA good story will shift and adapt depending on the situation. A pitch is the same thing.\nYou have to be so clear on your business, you can talk about it in any situation.\nYou need to consider:\nWhat is important to your audience? Share the solution for your audiences problem.\nWhat is the size of your audience?\nWhat is the education level of your audience?\nEtc…\nGo through each of the pictures and talk about the different ways you would want to\ncommunicate based on the situation.\nAsk: How would you pitch to a small group of business people?\nAnswer: Focus on numbers, impact on their business, formal, can be more personal and\ninteractive because of the small group size, etc…\nAsk: How would you pitch to a large audience with hundreds or thousands of people?\nAnswer: A bit more general, possibly informative, find something common about the\nwhole group they can relate to (if possible), etc…\n\nAsk: How would you pitch to a smaller group (maybe they are students for example)?\nAnswer: Focus on the groups needs, make connections with individuals and personalize\nthings more, formal/informal depending on the group, etc…\nAsk: How would you pitch to a group of children?\nAnswer: Can be fun and silly, get low on their level, use a friendlier voice, can add\nelements of magical storytelling, etc…\n5\nYOUR STANCE\n10 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: What do you think about these people stances? Go one by one and discuss the\ngood and bad things about each persons stance. Think about best practices and how\neach person can improve.\nPerson 1: She looks professional and friendly. She is very comfortable and has open\nbody language.\nPerson 2: His hands clasped in front of him shows “closed” body language. This can\nshow signs that he is uncomfortable or nervous. Some people might point out that he is\nsmiling too much. It shows his personality here which is nice, but don’t over exaggerate\ntoo much or be unnatural. Some people might point out that he is leaning a little weird\nand that he should stand up straight.\nPerson 3: She looks confident, happy and comfortable. She looks confident here, but\nthis is a slightly “closed” body position because her hands are in her pockets. Her\nthumbs are out of which actually shows confidence, but generally hands in pockets\nshould be avoided. Be careful of hands in pockets because it can show a lot about how\nyou are feeling!\nPerson 4: He looks happy, but his arms are crossed and crossed. This can signal to\npeople that you are uncomfortable (same as crossed arms, fidgeting, or clasped hands).\nPerson 5: He is referencing something on the board in this image. It is ok to reference\nthe board; however, be careful how you do it. Don’t do it too often and make sure that\nyour body is facing the audience! If you look at the board, it is very easy to do it too\nmuch and end up “talking to the board”. This is not good in a presentation as you want\nthe audience’s eyes on you while you speak to THEM (not the board)! Also his hand is\nin his pocket which is a “closed” position.\nBased on what we have already said, recap some best practices:\nStand confidently\nDon’t cross your arms, stay open\nTall and proud\nBe grounded, don’t wobble and fidget\n\nDon’t turn your back to the audience\nKeep good posture and aligned spine\nDon’t look over confident with chest pushed out too far,\nAgain, make sure that you consider the people in the room when considering your\nstance and body language. Who is in the room might change your stance.\nChildren: Get low, on their level\nFew people: Can gather around. Be comfortable with the group (still professional). If you\nare speaking to a small group is a great time to be engaging. Make eye contact with\neveryone.\nLarge group: This might be more of a formal presentation.\nElders or officials: You might want to show other signs of respect or have more “humble”\nbody language.\n6\nYOUR VOICE\n5 minutes: Lecture\nWe are humans. Pause, breathe, speak to people, not at them. Don’t shove information\ndown their throats.\nAsk: What are some ways to use your voice to actually help you tell a better story?\nUse voice inflections. This will help people stay engaged by introducing new sounds and\ntones (show an example of speaking monotone vs speaking with inflections)\nTone can bring emotion into a story (build suspense, show happiness/sadness, etc…)\nDon’t scream, but be loud enough that people can hear what you are saying.\nDon’t whisper, nobody will be able to hear you! Speak to the people in the far back of the\nroom.\n7\nSHOW YOUR PASSION!\nLook happy!\nBe yourself\nShow the business that you love and are passionate about!\n3 minutes: Lecture\nPlease, LOOK HAPPY!\nBe yourself\nShow the business that you love and are passionate about!\nPeople often buy into the entrepreneur, not the idea\n\nI have seen so many entrepreneurs come up to pitch and they look too serious or very\nuncomfortable. When this happens, you appear unapproachable or it brings the feeling\nthat you don’t really want to be there.\n8\nTHE 1 SENTENCE PITCH\nWHAT\ndo you do\n15 minutes: Lecture + activity\n5 minutes: Lecture\nAs mentioned earlier, it is important to be prepared to pitch your idea in a variety of\nsituations and contexts. Trainer will draw a triangle on the board and use this shape to\ndescribe the content of your pitch depending on the time available.\nAt the point of the triangle (the top), there is a very little bit of time; therefore, the\ninformation shouldn’t be very detailed. When you only have a short period, clarity is the\nmost important. WHAT do you do?\nAs you go down the triangle, it gets wider, leaving more time for more detailed\ninformation such as your strategy, finances, or traction.\nMake sure you prioritize the importance of the information to the audience. There is no\nneed to talk about everything. Think about what is necessary based on the time you\nhave and the audience you are talking to.\n10 minutes: Activity\nWe will focus on the 1 sentence pitch first.\nAsk the class “What should the 1 sentence pitch consist of?”\nAnswer: The core of your business. A clear sentence about what you do.\nNo details are included in this, but it clearly shows what you do and touches on what\nmakes you unique.\nExample: Tourism App is a mobile application to help tourists easily experience the real\nKurdish culture. (that is it!)\n2 minutes: Everyone should write out their 1 sentence pitch.\nHave a few people share and give feedback depending on the time.\n9\nTHE 3 SENTENCE PITCH\nWHAT\ndo you do\nStrategy\nGrowth plan\nMore details\n\n8 minutes: Lecture + Discussion\nThe 3 minute pitch:\nAt the end of the program, you will all pitch for 3 minutes.\nWe went from the 1 sentence pitch to 3 minutes.\nDiscussion: What should we add into this with the additional time?\nCan talk more about strategy\nHow you will make it happen\nYour growth plan\nMore details about your business\nEtc…\nA question that might come up:\nWhy 3 minutes?\nWe believe that if you can’t explain your idea in 3 minutes, you don’t have a clear picture\nof your idea.\nThe pitch isn’t meant for you to explain every detail of your business, but rather to get\nthe attention of the audience and lead to further conversations down the line.\nPeople will get distracted and not listen much longer after 3 minutes.\n3 minute pitches are the standard. If you are invited to a pitch competition, you should\nexpect approximately 3 minutes to present.\n10\n5. Your Business Model\n6. Your Growth Strategy\n7. Your Team\n8. Your Ask\nThe Challenge\nThe Customers\nThe Solution\nValue Proposition\nKEY POINTS:\n5 minutes: Lecture\nRecap the discussion from the previous slide:\nThere are so many things that you could include in your pitch, but as we said before, you\nwant to prioritize some things. Here are some key points that should be included in your\npitch:\nThe Challenge: What is the problem that you are solving? If you aren’t solving a\nproblem, it probably isn’t a viable business idea.\nThe Customers: Who is facing that problem?\nThe Solution: How does your business solve this challenge for your target customers?\nValue Proposition: What makes you different from your competitors?\n\nYour Business Model: How does your business work and make money?\nYour Growth Strategy: Is this idea sustainable? How do you see your business growing\nin the coming years? How do you plan on making that happen?\nYour Team: Who is going to make this happen? It is hard to believe that 1 person can do\nall of this alone! Who else is on your team?\nYour Ask: Why are you pitching? What are you asking for? Is it financial? Are you\nlooking for help? Are you looking for another type of support?\nQuestion that might come up:\nHow can we do all of this in 3 minutes?\nRemind them that they don’t need a slide for every point. They are telling a story and\ncombine these points in creative ways.\nPoints 1-4 are so closely tied into each other they can be covered in 1-2 slides if you\nwanted.\nYou don’t need to talk on every point for a long time, just touch on them.\n11\n10 minutes: Video + Discussion\nWatch the example pitch together.\nAsk: What did you think about this pitch?\nPotential answers:\nSpoke slowly\nA little hard to understand\nGreat use of visuals\nClearly defined problem\nOnly 3 minutes!\nEtc...\n12\nThree minutes to pitch\nTwo minutes for questions\nThree judges\nTHE PITCH\n5 minutes: Lecture + Q&A\nTo wrap up, I just want to give some more information about the pitch coming up on\nThursday\nThree minutes to pitch: Each entrepreneur will have three minutes to pitch.\nWhy three minutes? We believe that if you can’t explain your idea in 3 minutes, you don’t\nhave a clear picture of your idea.\n\nThe pitch isn’t meant for you to explain every detail of your business, but rather to get\nthe attention of the audience and lead to further conversations down the line.\n3 minute pitches are the standard. If you are invited to a pitch competition, you should\nexpect approximately 3 minutes to present.\nOnce the timer goes off, we will interrupt you and begin clapping. Make sure you have\npracticed so that you have a strong finish and don’t get interrupted because you ran out\nof time.\nTwo minutes for questions: After your pitch time is up, the judges will have 2 minutes to\nask questions. The time will start once the first judge has finished asking his/her 1st\nquestion. Once the timer goes off, we will allow you to wrap up your answer, but no more\nquestions will be asked.\nThree judges: During Ignite, we choose judges who are a part of our community. These\njudges have worked with entrepreneurs before or are entrepreneurs themselves. Some\nof them have even gone through Ignite. Trainers should share any relevant information\nabout the judges that will be in attendance.\nWell-Defined Challenge\n(1-5)\nProduct or Service Meets Customers’ Needs\n(1-5)\nStrong Business Model\n(1-5)\n\nFeasible Approach and Plan\n(1-5)\nCreative or Innovative Idea\n(1-5)\nJUDGING CRITERIA:\n55 minutes: Lecture + Activity\n5 minutes: Lecture + Q&A\nJudging criteria:\nWell-defined challenge: Does the entrepreneur have a clear understanding of the\nchallenge or gap that they're trying to solve?\nProduct or service meets customers' needs: Does the entrepreneur's business idea\nclearly solve the challenge that they've defined, and is it supported by customer\ninterviews and market data?\nStrong business model: How does the startup produce, deliver, and receive\ncompensation for the product or service they are providing to their customer? Does the\nentrepreneur have an understanding of how they will make money? For nonprofits, have\nthey thought through how to be sustainable and what types of organizations and people\nmay be interested in sponsoring?\nFeasible approach and plan: Is the startup idea feasible in this context and market?\nDoes the entrepreneur understand what steps need to be taken to launch, and will they\nbe able to complete them?\nInnovative or creative business idea: Is this something new and creative? Does this have\nthe potential to disrupt “business as usual”? Is the idea interesting and compelling?\nEach of these components will be judged from a score between 1-5\n50 minutes: Practice!\nNow, you will have the rest of the session to work on your pitches! We will come back\ntogether at 11:30 to talk about some final points.\nLet them go where they are comfortable to work on their pitches.\nThere are a ton of templates and free high quality pictures available to you.As you are\ncreating your first pitches, consider taking a look at some of these resources:\n\nPowerpoint\nSlidescarnival\nFlaticon\nFreepik\nContinue working on your pitch deck!\nShare it with 2-3 other people for feedback!\nIf you choose to use slides, please use Google Slides!\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up!\n15\nTHANK YOU\nAny Questions?\n16\nUPDATED COPY OF THE PITCH\nTHE PITCH\nHOW TO CONVEY YOUR BUSINESS IDEA IN 3 MINUTES OR LESS\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | Best practices\n10:00 | Break\n10:15 | The pitch\n11:00 | Build your pitch!\n11:45 - 12:00 | Wrap up\n----\n9:00 Settle in\nTea/coffee\nCheck in, give updates or news\nGo around the room and share progress\nAnswer any questions about the feasibility study or ending the program\n9:30 Begin the session\nToday during, we are going to talk about your pitch!\n\nTodays session will be all about communicating you business idea in in any situation.\n1\nCommunicate your business in a variety of situations while highlighting efficiency and\nvalue.\nLearn pitching best practices with a focus on clarity and impact.\nBuild out your pitch deck with a strong value proposition.\nSESSION OBJECTIVES\n1 minute: Objectives\nCommunicate your business in a variety of situations while highlighting efficiency and\nvalue.\nLearn pitching best practices with a focus on clarity and impact.\nBuild out your pitch deck with a strong value proposition.\n2\nSTORY-TELLING\n15 minutes: Activity + discussion\n7 minutes: Activity\nBefore we get started, we are going to look at the idea of story telling.\nEveryone should find a partner. If there is an odd number, use another trainer.\nEach person is going to get 3 minutes to tell a story. It can be something funny, a favorite\nchildhood story, or anything else (except about your business).\nSet the timer for 3 minutes for one person, then switch to give 3 minutes for the second\nperson.\n8 minutes: Discussion\nWho heard a good story? What made it a good story? What really worked well? Was\nthere anything that wasn’t so good? Why?\nWrite answers on the board\nSome potential answers that might come up:\nIt was funny, sad, happy, scary, etc… (Was good because it connected with you\nemotionally)\nIt was relatable (you could empathize with the person in the story)\nIt was meaningful (had a purpose, or moral)\nI learned something (had a purpose, or moral)\nIt is about something I care about (engaging)\nEtc…\nWas there anything that you didn’t like?\nI didn’t understand the point of the story\nI didn’t get the backstory so couldn’t relate\n\nI wasn’t interested in the topic\n3\nTension\nIntro\nMoral\nTime\nTension\nTELL A STORY!\nClimax\n5 minutes: Lecture\nAll of those points you brought up are right. There is a lot that goes into a great story.\nGreat stories typically follow this framework which includes many of the points that you\nalready brought up.\nThere is an introduction, background and a setting is provided.\nThere is a build up. Tension connects with you on some type of emotional level.\nThen something happens! (climax)\nAnd then you wrap the story up with some type of moral or purpose.\nWhy is storytelling an important skill when thinking about your pitch?\nA pitch is just a story!\nIntroduction: Introduce yourself and your business idea. What is the problem you have\nidentified?\nTension: Give some more information. How big is this problem? Why so many people\nneed your solution. Connect with people emotionally here!\nClimax: We can solve it! Tell us about your amazing idea here. How does it solve the\nproblem?\nMoral: This is what we need. Your pitch should have an ending or some type of\nconclusion. This can be a moral, an ask, or a call to action.\n4\nKNOW YOUR AUDIENCE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nHow you choose to tell your story shouldn’t always be exactly the same way. There are\nother factors that go into great storytelling that would impact your delivery.\nA good story will shift and adapt depending on the situation. A pitch is the same thing.\nYou have to be so clear on your business, you can talk about it in any situation.\nYou need to consider:\nWhat is important to your audience? Share the solution for your audiences problem.\nWhat is the size of your audience?\nWhat is the education level of your audience?\nHow does your pitch highlight efficiency, reduce risks, or improve long-term success?\n\nEtc…\nGo through each of the pictures and talk about the different ways you would want to\ncommunicate based on the situation.\nAsk: How would you pitch to a small group of business people?\nAnswer:\nFocus on numbers, impact on their business, formal, can be more personal and\ninteractive because of the small group size, etc…\nEmphasize how your business increases efficiency and reduces operational risks,\nmaking it a more attractive investment.\nAsk: How would you pitch to a large audience with hundreds or thousands of people?\nAnswer:\nA bit more general, possibly informative, find something common about the whole group\nthey can relate to (if possible), etc…\nHighlight how your business model ensures long-term sustainability and resilience.\nAsk: How would you pitch to a smaller group (maybe they are students for example)?\nAnswer: Focus on the groups needs, make connections with individuals and personalize\nthings more, formal/informal depending on the group, etc…\nShow how your business makes life easier, saves resources, or offers a better return on\ninvestment.\nAsk: How would you pitch to a group of children?\nAnswer: Can be fun and silly, get low on their level, use a friendlier voice, can add\nelements of magical storytelling, etc…\n5\nYOUR STANCE\n10 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: What do you think about these people stances? Go one by one and discuss the\ngood and bad things about each persons stance. Think about best practices and how\neach person can improve.\nPerson 1: She looks professional and friendly. She is very comfortable and has open\nbody language.\nPerson 2: His hands clasped in front of him shows “closed” body language. This can\nshow signs that he is uncomfortable or nervous. Some people might point out that he is\nsmiling too much. It shows his personality here which is nice, but don’t over exaggerate\ntoo much or be unnatural. Some people might point out that he is leaning a little weird\nand that he should stand up straight.\nPerson 3: She looks confident, happy and comfortable. She looks confident here, but\nthis is a slightly “closed” body position because her hands are in her pockets. Her\nthumbs are out of which actually shows confidence, but generally hands in pockets\n\nshould be avoided. Be careful of hands in pockets because it can show a lot about how\nyou are feeling!\nPerson 4: He looks happy, but his arms are crossed and crossed. This can signal to\npeople that you are uncomfortable (same as crossed arms, fidgeting, or clasped hands).\nPerson 5: He is referencing something on the board in this image. It is ok to reference\nthe board; however, be careful how you do it. Don’t do it too often and make sure that\nyour body is facing the audience! If you look at the board, it is very easy to do it too\nmuch and end up “talking to the board”. This is not good in a presentation as you want\nthe audience’s eyes on you while you speak to THEM (not the board)! Also his hand is\nin his pocket which is a “closed” position.\nBased on what we have already said, recap some best practices:\nStand confidently\nDon’t cross your arms, stay open\nTall and proud\nBe grounded, don’t wobble and fidget\nDon’t turn your back to the audience\nKeep good posture and aligned spine\nDon’t look over confident with chest pushed out too far,\nAgain, make sure that you consider the people in the room when considering your\nstance and body language. Who is in the room might change your stance.\nChildren: Get low, on their level\nFew people: Can gather around. Be comfortable with the group (still professional). If you\nare speaking to a small group is a great time to be engaging. Make eye contact with\neveryone.\nLarge group: This might be more of a formal presentation.\nElders or officials: You might want to show other signs of respect or have more “humble”\nbody language.\n6\nYOUR VOICE\n5 minutes: Lecture\nWe are humans. Pause, breathe, speak to people, not at them. Don’t shove information\ndown their throats.\nAsk: What are some ways to use your voice to actually help you tell a better story?\nUse voice inflections. This will help people stay engaged by introducing new sounds and\ntones (show an example of speaking monotone vs speaking with inflections)\nTone can bring emotion into a story (build suspense, show happiness/sadness, etc…)\nDon’t scream, but be loud enough that people can hear what you are saying.\n\nDon’t whisper, nobody will be able to hear you! Speak to the people in the far back of the\nroom.\n7\nSHOW YOUR PASSION!\nLook happy!\nBe yourself\nShow the business that you love and are passionate about!\n3 minutes: Lecture\nPlease, LOOK HAPPY!\nBe yourself\nShow the business that you love and are passionate about!\nPeople often buy into the entrepreneur, not the idea\nI have seen so many entrepreneurs come up to pitch and they look too serious or very\nuncomfortable. When this happens, you appear unapproachable or it brings the feeling\nthat you don’t really want to be there.\n8\nTHE 1 SENTENCE PITCH\nWHAT\ndo you do\n15 minutes: Lecture + activity\n5 minutes: Lecture\nAs mentioned earlier, it is important to be prepared to pitch your idea in a variety of\nsituations and contexts. Trainer will draw a triangle on the board and use this shape to\ndescribe the content of your pitch depending on the time available.\nAt the point of the triangle (the top), there is a very little bit of time; therefore, the\ninformation shouldn’t be very detailed. When you only have a short period, clarity is the\nmost important. WHAT do you do?\nAs you go down the triangle, it gets wider, leaving more time for more detailed\ninformation such as your strategy, finances, or traction.\nMake sure you prioritize the importance of the information to the audience. There is no\nneed to talk about everything. Think about what is necessary based on the time you\nhave and the audience you are talking to.\n10 minutes: Activity\nWe will focus on the 1 sentence pitch first.\nAsk the class “What should the 1 sentence pitch consist of?”\nAnswer: The core of your business. A clear sentence about what you do\n\nNo details are included in this, but it clearly shows what you do and touches on what\nmakes you unique.\nExample: Tourism App helps visitors efficiently discover authentic Kurdish culture\nthrough personalized recommendations and local insights. (that is it!)\n2 minutes: Everyone should write out their 1 sentence pitch.\nHave a few people share and give feedback depending on the time.\n9\nTHE 3 SENTENCE PITCH\nWHAT\ndo you do\nStrategy\nGrowth plan\nMore details\n8 minutes: Lecture + Discussion\nThe 3 minute pitch:\nAt the end of the program, you will all pitch for 3 minutes.\nWe went from the 1 sentence pitch to 3 minutes.\nDiscussion: What should we add into this with the additional time?\nCan talk more about strategy\nHow you will make it happen\nYour growth plan\nMore details about your business\nEtc…\nA question that might come up:\nWhy 3 minutes?\nWe believe that if you can’t explain your idea in 3 minutes, you don’t have a clear picture\nof your idea.\nThe pitch isn’t meant for you to explain every detail of your business, but rather to get\nthe attention of the audience and lead to further conversations down the line.\nPeople will get distracted and not listen much longer after 3 minutes.\n3 minute pitches are the standard. If you are invited to a pitch competition, you should\nexpect approximately 3 minutes to present.\n10\n5. Your Business Model\n6. Your Growth Strategy\n7. Your Team\n8.

      "content": " Based on my review of the Five One Labs Ignite curriculum (pre-incubator) documents, I see both strengths and opportunities for integrating green elements in a way that aligns with the business-first approach suggested in the \"Integrated Business Resilience Framework.\"\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\nThe Ignite curriculum provides a solid foundation in design thinking, customer research, problem definition, ideation, and pitching. The updates already made to modules 2 (User Research), 4 (Market Research), 5 (Reframe), 6 (Creativity and Ideation), and 7 (The Pitch) show thoughtful integration of green elements, primarily focusing on:\n\n1. Expanding user personas to include environmental values\n2. Adding resource efficiency considerations to market analysis\n3. Introducing cost and resource factors in customer journey mapping\n4. Including efficiency criteria in idea evaluation\n5. Adding impact-driven elements to pitch judging criteria\n\nThese changes are generally subtle and business-focused, which aligns well with the core principles in the framework document.\n\n## Alignment Opportunities\n\nDespite these improvements, there are several opportunities to better align the pre-incubator with the incubator program and strengthen the \"greening\" approach:\n\n### 1. Consistent Framing & Terminology\n\nThe terminology varies across modules. For example, in some places we talk about \"energy costs,\" in others \"resource efficiency,\" and elsewhere \"environmental factors.\" A consistent framing (like the \"business resilience\" framing used in the integration framework) would help create a coherent theme.\n\n### 2. Progressive Introduction of Concepts\n\nCurrently, green elements seem somewhat isolated within individual modules rather than building upon each other. There's an opportunity to create a progressive learning journey where basic concepts introduced in early modules evolve into more nuanced applications in later ones.\n\n### 3. Practical Tools Integration\n\nThe Business Efficiency Workbook and Risk Assessment Process tools appear in the incubator program but aren't mentioned in the Ignite pre-incubator. Simplified versions of these tools could be introduced earlier.\n\n### 4. Success Stories & Examples\n\nThe curriculum would benefit from consistent use of case examples showing how efficiency and resource considerations create business value.\n\n## Specific Improvement Recommendations\n\n### Module 2: User Research\n- Add a short exercise where participants identify one external factor (like energy reliability) that might affect their users' experience\n- Introduce the concept of \"no-regrets paths\" mentioned in the framework\n\n### Module 4: Market Research\n- Connect the updated \"Market Forces & Business Costs\" slide to concrete examples of businesses succeeding through efficiency\n- Add a simple exercise to identify one resource constraint that could affect their business\n\n### Module 5: Reframe\n- Strengthen the connection between persona values and business model in customer journey mapping\n- When creating \"How Might We\" statements, include an optional exercise to formulate a statement related to operational efficiency\n\n### Module 6: Creativity & Ideation\n- Add \"resource efficiency lens\" as a formal ideation technique alongside \"$0\" and \"What would Google do?\"\n- Introduce a simple version of the Business Efficiency Checklist as an idea evaluation tool\n\n### Module 7: The Pitch\n- Create a sample pitch deck that effectively incorporates resource efficiency as a competitive advantage\n- Add guidance on addressing potential investor questions about operational resilience\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nTo implement these changes while maintaining the business-first approach:\n\n1. **Focus on practical value**: Frame all green elements in terms of business benefits first (cost savings, competitive advantage, risk reduction) rather than environmental impact.\n\n2. **Use local examples**: Where possible, reference local Iraqi businesses that have succeeded through resource efficiency.\n\n3. **Provide options**: Present efficiency and resilience considerations as optional elements that entrepreneurs can incorporate if relevant, rather than mandatory components.\n\n4. **Start small**: For first-time entrepreneurs, focus on 1-2 simple efficiency concepts rather than overwhelming them with complex frameworks.\n\nOverall, the curriculum updates show a promising start toward \"greening\" while maintaining a business focus. With the adjustments suggested above, the pre-incubator could better prepare participants for the more advanced business resilience concepts introduced in the incubator program.",

Success Stories & Examples\n\nThe curriculum would benefit from consistent use of case examples showing how efficiency and resource considerations create business value.\n\n## Specific Improvement Recommendations\n\n### Module 2: User Research\n- Add a short exercise where participants identify one external factor (like energy reliability) that might affect their users' experience\n- Introduce the concept of \"no-regrets paths\" mentioned in the framework\n\n### Module 4: Market Research\n- Connect the updated \"Market Forces & Business Costs\" slide to concrete examples of businesses succeeding through efficiency\n- Add a simple exercise to identify one resource constraint that could affect their business\n\n### Module 5: Reframe\n- Strengthen the connection between persona values and business model in customer journey mapping\n- When creating \"How Might We\" statements, include an optional exercise to formulate a statement related to operational efficiency\n\n### Module 6: Creativity & Ideation\n- Add \"resource efficiency lens\" as a formal ideation technique alongside \"$0\" and \"What would Google do?\"\n- Introduce a simple version of the Business Efficiency Checklist as an idea evaluation tool\n\n### Module 7: The Pitch\n- Create a sample pitch deck that effectively incorporates resource efficiency as a competitive advantage\n- Add guidance on addressing potential investor questions about operational resilience\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nTo implement these changes while maintaining the business-first approach:\n\n1. **Focus on practical value**: Frame all green elements in terms of business benefits first (cost savings, competitive advantage, risk reduction) rather than environmental impact.\n\n2. **Use local examples**: Where possible, reference local Iraqi businesses that have succeeded through resource efficiency.\n\n3. **Provide options**: Present efficiency and resilience considerations as optional elements that entrepreneurs can incorporate if relevant, rather than mandatory components.\n\n4. **Start small**: For first-time entrepreneurs, focus on 1-2 simple efficiency concepts rather than overwhelming them with complex frameworks.\n\nOverall, the curriculum updates show a promising start toward \"greening\" while maintaining a business focus. With the adjustments suggested above, the pre-incubator could better prepare participants for the more advanced business resilience concepts introduced in the incubator program.",

The most successful businesses address current needs while contributing to a more sustainable future.\n```\n\n## MODULE 7: THE PITCH\n\n### Change 1: Enhanced 1-Sentence Pitch Example\n**Location:** Update example on THE 1 SENTENCE PITCH slide\n\n**Replace existing example with:**\n```\nExample: Eco-Tourism App connects visitors with authentic Kurdish experiences while promoting sustainable travel practices that benefit local communities.\n```\n\n**Updated Facilitator Notes:**\n```\nNotice how this example incorporates sustainability (eco-tourism, sustainable practices) while highlighting benefits for both customers and local communities. When crafting your one-sentence pitch, consider including a green element if it strengthens your value proposition.\n```\n\n### Change 2: Updated Judging Criteria\n**Location:** Add to JUDGING CRITERIA slide\n\n**Add to existing slide content:**\n```\nGreen Innovation Factor\n(1-5)\n```\n\n**Updated Facilitator Notes:**\n```\nGreen Innovation Factor: This criterion evaluates whether your business incorporates environmentally-friendly approaches that also create business value. Judges will be looking for solutions that address environmental challenges in ways that strengthen your business model, such as through cost savings, brand differentiation, or long-term resilience.\n```\n\n### Change 3: Add Sustainability Section to Pitch Template\n**Location:** Add after the KEY POINTS slide\n\n**New Slide Content:**\n```\nINTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO YOUR PITCH\nIf relevant to your business, consider highlighting:\n\n- How your approach reduces resource use or waste\n- Any energy or material efficiency advantages\n- Long-term sustainability of your business model\n- How environmental benefits create customer value\n\nRemember: Only include green elements that strengthen your business case!\n```\n\n**Facilitator Notes:**\n```\nThis is an optional slide for businesses where sustainability is a relevant differentiator. Emphasize that green elements should only be included if they create tangible business value. Help participants identify specific data points or examples that demonstrate both environmental and business benefits.\n```\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE\n\n1. **Selective application:** Apply these changes where they naturally fit with the curriculum flow and local context.\n\n2. **Real examples:** Wherever possible, include local Iraqi examples of businesses successfully using green approaches.\n\n3. **Business-first framing:** Always frame environmental benefits as secondary to business benefits (cost savings, competitive advantage, market opportunity).\n\n4. **Local context:** When discussing \"green,\" emphasize aspects most relevant to Iraq - like solar energy adoption, water conservation, and material efficiency.\n\n5. **Optional depth:** Allow facilitators to adjust the depth of green content based on participant interest and relevance to their business ideas.\n\nThese changes provide a stronger green thread throughout the curriculum while maintaining the primary focus on business fundamentals. The environmental elements are consistently framed as opportunities for business advantage rather than moral imperatives, making them accessible and relevant to all participants regardless of their personal environmental values.",

      "content": " # Strategic Ways to Showcase Five One Labs' Implementation of Climate-Integrated Curriculum\n\nBased on the completed work and the IOM contract requirements, here are creative approaches to highlight Five One Labs' success in delivering this climate resilience curriculum integration project:\n\n## 1. Emphasize the Business-First Approach\n\nThe curriculum integration we've developed distinguishes itself by framing climate resilience as a business advantage rather than an added burden. This approach:\n\n- Makes sustainability concepts accessible to entrepreneurs with varying backgrounds\n- Ensures practical business value while addressing environmental challenges\n- Positions Five One Labs as innovative in their approach to climate education\n\n**Deliverable Idea:** Create a one-pager titled \"The Five One Labs Method: Making Climate Action Business-Smart\" that outlines this unique approach for IOM.\n\n## 2. Highlight Women's Leadership Connection\n\nThe contract specifically mentions enhancing \"women's leadership and participation in climate resilience.\" Our curriculum modifications support this by:\n\n- Including design thinking exercises that examine how women entrepreneurs are uniquely positioned to identify climate-related market opportunities\n- Incorporating case studies of successful women-led green businesses in Iraq\n- Framing resource efficiency as a competitive advantage in markets where women entrepreneurs often operate\n\n**Deliverable Idea:** Develop a special addendum focused specifically on women's climate leadership opportunities within the curriculum.\n\n## 3. Showcase Comprehensive Integration Across Modules\n\nRather than creating a standalone \"climate module,\" our approach integrates climate concepts throughout the entire program:\n\n- User Research: Added environmental values considerations to customer research\n- Market Research: Incorporated green market trends and competitive advantages\n- Reframe: Enhanced user personas and journey maps with sustainability touchpoints\n- Creativity & Ideation: Added green innovation lenses to brainstorming\n- The Pitch: Updated judging criteria and pitch structure to include green elements\n\n**Deliverable Idea:** Create a visual curriculum map showing how climate concepts flow through each module, creating a coherent learning journey.\n\n## 4. Emphasize Iraqi Context and Local Relevance\n\nThe contract emphasizes tailoring content to the Iraqi context, which our work accomplishes through:\n\n- Examples focused on local challenges like energy reliability, water conservation, and local material sourcing\n- Case studies of Iraqi green businesses like KESK Solar\n- Adaptation of concepts to reflect Iraqi market realities and entrepreneurial ecosystem\n\n**Deliverable Idea:** Compile a \"Green Entrepreneurship in Iraq: Market Opportunity Guide\" that connects curriculum concepts to local business opportunities.\n\n## 5. Demonstrate Implementation Readiness\n\nOur deliverables go beyond theoretical concepts to provide practical implementation tools:\n\n- Detailed facilitator notes for each module\n- Phase-based implementation roadmap\n- Training-for-trainers guidance\n- Measurement framework to track impact\n\n**Deliverable Idea:** Create an \"Implementation Toolkit\" with ready-to-use facilitator guides, templates, and evaluation forms.\n\n## 6. Connect to Global Best Practices\n\nWhile maintaining local relevance, our approach also connects to global sustainability frameworks:\n\n- Aligns with international business sustainability concepts\n- Incorporates proven methodologies like resource efficiency audits adapted to the Iraqi context\n- References global green business trends while making them locally actionable\n\n**Deliverable Idea:** Create a brief \"Global-Local Connection\" document showing how the curriculum bridges international best practices with Iraqi entrepreneurial needs.\n\n## 7. Multilingual Implementation Strategy\n\nTo fulfill the multilingual requirement in the contract, propose:\n\n- A phased translation approach starting with key terminology glossaries in Arabic and Kurdish\n- Visual-heavy materials that minimize text-heavy translations\n- Culturally-appropriate examples for each language context\n\n**Deliverable Idea:** Develop a \"Multilingual Implementation Guide\" with key green business terminology in all three languages and culturally-specific examples.\n\n## 8. Demonstrate Measurement & Impact\n\nTo show commitment to results beyond just curriculum development:\n\n- Include baseline assessment questions to measure pre/post climate knowledge\n- Create simple metrics for tracking green practice adoption by entrepreneurs\n- Develop case study templates to document success stories\n\n**Deliverable Idea:** Create an \"Impact Measurement Framework\" with suggested indicators aligned with IOM's CARS initiative goals.\n\n---\n\nBy strategically highlighting these elements in your final deliverables package, you'll demonstrate that Five One Labs has not only met but exceeded the contract requirements, positioning them as thoughtful leaders in climate-integrated entrepreneurship support in Iraq.",

This strategic enhancement equips entrepreneurs with the tools and knowledge needed to address environmental challenges while building sustainable businesses that promote women's leadership in climate resilience and peacebuilding.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nRather than creating a standalone \"sustainability module,\" we employed a **Business-First Integration Strategy** that embeds climate resilience concepts throughout the entire entrepreneurial journey. This approach ensures that sustainability is framed as a strategic business advantage rather than an additional burden, making the concepts accessible and relevant to all entrepreneurs regardless of their business type or sector.\n\n### Key Integration Principles\n\n1. **Business Value First:** All climate concepts are framed in terms of tangible business benefits: cost reduction, risk mitigation, market differentiation, and long-term resilience.\n\n2. **Iraqi Context Relevance:** Climate concepts are tailored to local realities such as energy reliability challenges, water conservation needs, and emerging green market opportunities in Iraq.\n\n3. **Practical Implementation Tools:** Each module includes actionable worksheets, checklists, and decision-making frameworks that entrepreneurs can immediately apply.\n\n4. **Progressive Learning Journey:** Climate concepts build systematically across modules, from basic efficiency considerations to advanced sustainable business modeling.\n\n## Curriculum Enhancements\n\n### Ignite (Pre-Incubator) Program Updates\n\nThe following Ignite modules received comprehensive climate resilience integration:\n\n1. **User Research:** Enhanced to capture customer sustainability values, resource constraints, and environmental preferences.\n\n2. **Market Research:** Expanded to include green market trends, climate-related risks, and competitive advantages through sustainability.\n\n3. **Reframe:** Augmented personas and customer journey mapping to include sustainability touchpoints and efficiency considerations.\n\n4. **Creativity & Ideation:** Added sustainability-focused brainstorming techniques and green evaluation criteria.\n\n5. **The Pitch:** Updated to include sustainability-focused value propositions and impact-driven evaluation criteria.\n\n### Incubator Program Updates\n\nThe following Incubator modules received priority climate resilience integration:\n\n1. **Business Model Canvas:** Enhanced to incorporate sustainability-focused revenue streams, partnerships, and value propositions.\n\n2. **Cost Model & Balance Sheet:** Updated to highlight efficiency investments, green CAPEX/OPEX differentiation, and long-term financial resilience.\n\n3. **Supply Chain:** Expanded to address sustainable sourcing, waste reduction, and operational resilience against climate disruptions.\n\n4. **Business Ethics:** Strengthened to address authentic sustainability practices, greenwashing avoidance, and values-driven decision-making.\n\n5. **Financing Alternatives:** Augmented with green funding opportunities specifically available in Iraq and the MENA region.\n\n6. **Risk & Crisis Management:** Enhanced with climate risk assessment tools and resilience-building strategies.\n\n## Key Deliverables Completed\n\n1. **Curriculum Integration:** Climate resilience practices have been seamlessly embedded into existing topics across both Ignite and Incubator programs.\n\n2. **Practical Examples:** Each module now includes case studies from local Iraqi and international companies demonstrating successful climate resilience initiatives.\n\n3. **Customized Content:** All materials are tailored to the Iraqi context while drawing on global best practices.\n\n4. **Trainer Support Materials:** Comprehensive facilitator notes, key talking points, and resource references have been developed for each module.\n\n5. **Implementation Tools:** New worksheets and handouts have been created to support practical application of climate resilience concepts.\n\n## Impact & Opportunities\n\nThis curriculum enhancement positions Five One Labs as a pioneer in climate-focused entrepreneurship support in Iraq. The integrated approach:\n\n1. Equips entrepreneurs with practical tools to build more resilient businesses\n2. Creates pathways for women's leadership in climate innovation\n3. Aligns entrepreneurial growth with global sustainability goals\n4. Establishes a foundation for future green business development programs\n\n## Next Steps Recommendations\n\n1. **Training of Trainers:** Conduct orientation sessions to familiarize Five One Labs trainers with the enhanced curriculum materials.\n\n2. **Multilingual Implementation:** Complete translations of key materials into Arabic and Kurdish to ensure linguistic inclusivity.\n\n3. **Impact Measurement:** Implement the suggested metrics framework to track green business adoption and climate leadership outcomes.\n\n4. **Funding Linkages:** Connect entrepreneurs to the identified green funding opportunities to accelerate sustainable business development.\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive curriculum integration creates lasting value for Five One Labs, the entrepreneurs they serve, and Iraq's broader sustainable development goals. By equipping entrepreneurs with climate resilience skills framed as business advantages, the project contributes directly to IOM's objectives of enhancing women's leadership and participation in climate resilience and peacebuilding.\n",

four key deliverables I've created that would be most valuable for Five One Labs to demonstrate project completion to IOM:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** - A comprehensive overview of the project approach, implementation, and achievements that highlights how we've met all contract requirements.\n\n2. **Green Business Guide** - A practical handout for entrepreneurs that fulfills the requirement for accessible materials in a format that could be easily translated into Arabic and Kurdish.\n\n3. **Trainer Support Guide** - Detailed notes and information sources for Five One Labs trainers to help them deliver the climate-integrated curriculum effectively.\n\n4. **Green Curriculum Integration Scorecard & Dashboard** - A systematic evaluation showing how we methodically enhanced each module, with clear metrics demonstrating significant improvement (220% increase in climate integration quality).\n\nThese deliverables collectively address all requirements specified in the contract:\n\n- ✓ **Climate Resilience Integration**: Demonstrated comprehensive embedding of climate concepts throughout the curriculum\n- ✓ **Practical Examples**: Included numerous Iraqi and international case studies in the guides\n- ✓ **Local Context**: Tailored all content to Iraqi realities and challenges\n- ✓ **Trainer Support**: Provided detailed facilitator notes and resources\n- ✓ **Strategic Approach**: Demonstrated systematic, well-reasoned integration through the scorecard\n\nThe dashboard visualization particularly helps Five One Labs showcase the project's impact in a visually compelling way that would be impressive to IOM and demonstrates your systematic, thorough approach to curriculum enhancement.\n\nWould you like me to make any modifications to these deliverables to better meet your needs or the expectations of Five One Labs and IOM?",

four key deliverables I've created that would be most valuable for Five One Labs to demonstrate project completion to IOM:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** - A comprehensive overview of the project approach, implementation, and achievements that highlights how we've met all contract requirements.\n\n2. **Green Business Guide** - A practical handout for entrepreneurs that fulfills the requirement for accessible materials in a format that could be easily translated into Arabic and Kurdish.\n\n3. **Trainer Support Guide** - Detailed notes and information sources for Five One Labs trainers to help them deliver the climate-integrated curriculum effectively.\n\n4. **Green Curriculum Integration Scorecard & Dashboard** - A systematic evaluation showing how we methodically enhanced each module, with clear metrics demonstrating significant improvement (220% increase in climate integration quality).\n\nThese deliverables collectively address all requirements specified in the contract:\n\n- ✓ **Climate Resilience Integration**: Demonstrated comprehensive embedding of climate concepts throughout the curriculum\n- ✓ **Practical Examples**: Included numerous Iraqi and international case studies in the guides\n- ✓ **Local Context**: Tailored all content to Iraqi realities and challenges\n- ✓ **Trainer Support**: Provided detailed facilitator notes and resources\n- ✓ **Strategic Approach**: Demonstrated systematic, well-reasoned integration through the scorecard\n\nThe dashboard visualization particularly helps Five One Labs showcase the project's impact in a visually compelling way that would be impressive to IOM and demonstrates your systematic, thorough approach to curriculum enhancement.\n\nWould you like me to make any modifications to these deliverables to better meet your needs or the expectations of Five One Labs and IOM?",
