      "content": "I am having a different opinion than my cofounder about our company strategy. We've been working together for 6 years on https://bloom.pm - I am wondering what the options are moving forward and need help seeing alternative approaches. I am at half salary now because our organization is struggling and make 2,200 dollars a month and am about to have a child. For background knowledge, he is moving more towards a technical solution so we can scalably unlock human potential for positive change, and I think that the poison is in the method and that we need to keep it human, relational, potentially unmeasurable. The main symptom of our disagreement is I can't stand hearing him talk anymore. He takes a lot of room working on bringing his vision into each meeting, micromanages, and doesn't trust our team. I've had enough. I am cofounder at 35% and he's 65% although we attempt to make decisions 50/50. I am currently a facilitator for our accelerator programs for social enterprises and this is where my 2,2000 dollars are coming from. The back office expenses are for the work I do attending the platform (digital app) design meetings, grant writing and growth meetings, and management project meetings. My first option is to move from being a cofounder to being a facilitator only and not attending the grant, management, and platform design meetings. That will free up my time to do other consulting/facilitation. Generate for me 3 alternative approaches that can help me have a salary, maintain reasonable relationship with my cofounder, and potentially ensuring that my organization Bloom can survive with/without me. I am able to be convinced to stay if we can work something out, although my challanges with my cofounder have been growing over the years.",

      "content": "Here are 3 alternative approaches to consider:\n\n1. Reduce your role to facilitator and advisor. As you mentioned, step back from attending meetings for the platform design, grant writing, and management. Focus on the facilitation work you enjoy and that generates income for you. Reduce your equity stake to compensate for the reduced role. This allows you to gain more independence, generate income, and maintain a cordial relationship with your cofounder as an advisor. The company can continue operating with your cofounder leading, and you can provide strategic guidance as needed.\n\n2. Negotiate a higher salary and decision making power. Have an honest conversation with your cofounder about your challenges and concerns. Express your desire for a higher leadership salary commensurate with your co-founder status, as well as a desire for equal decision making power and trust in your team. Be open to compromise, but stand firm in needing to see real change in order to stay fully engaged. If changes are made, it allows you both to continue building the company together. If not, you've expressed your needs and can move to Option 1 or 3.  \n\n3. Explore a management buyout of your shares. As a last resort, you could investigate options to sell your equity stake back to the company or your cofounder. This would provide you capital to generate income from other work. You would no longer have the stress and challenges of your current role, while allowing the company to continue under your cofounder's leadership. You can even consider offering to stay on as an advisor. This allows both parties to move forward independently and potentially maintain a working relationship.\n\nOverall, the options aim to reduce your stress, increase your income and decision making power where possible, maintain a relationship with your cofounder/company to whatever degree works for both parties, and ensure the continuity of your organization with or without your day-to-day involvement. Please let me know if any of these options resonate with you or if you would like me to provide any additional suggestions. I wish you the very best in resolving this challenging situation.",

      "content": "I see, that does complicate matters given the limited financial resources. In that case, I would suggest focusing on Options 1 and 2 for now:\n\n1. Reduce to an advisory/facilitator role:  This still seems a viable approach as it can reduce your day-to-day stresses and time commitment, while allowing you to generate some income. As an advisor, you can guide the strategic direction and facilitate key programs, without having to attend as many operational meetings. The equity stake and salary may need to be renegotiated based on your reduced role, but at a nonprofit the equity stake is less critical. This approach maintains your involvement, but gives more control/leadership to your cofounder.\n\n2. Improve relationship and address challenges: Given the limited funding, maintaining the current leadership and improving the working dynamic with your cofounder is ideal if possible. Some suggestions here:\n\n•Have an open and honest conversation about your concerns, challenges, and what you both want. Compromise where you can.\n\n•Consider bringing in a mediator or counselor to help facilitate productive communication. \n\n•Clarify responsibilities, decision making power, and take concrete steps to build back trust. Start with small wins.\n\n•Renegotiate salary once new funding comes in to address the imbalance. But in the interim, at minimum negotiate for your basic financial needs to be met, especially with a child.  \n\n•Consider trial periods where one leader is more in control, then switch. This could help address micromanaging and power imbalances. Rotate periodically. \n\n• Foster open team discussions where all voices are heard. Your cofounder needs to listen to and empower others. Counseling could help address this.\n\nOverall, in a nonprofit, maintaining leadership stability and improving dynamics are most critical right now given limited resources. If, after reasonable efforts, the situation remains untenable, you can revisit other options. But there are approaches you can try to improve working relations, meet each other's key needs, and share decision making and control before more drastic steps. The key is open, honest, and solution-oriented communication.\n\nDoes this help provide some constructive approaches to explore? Let me know if you have any other questions. I wish you the very best in this challenging situation.",
