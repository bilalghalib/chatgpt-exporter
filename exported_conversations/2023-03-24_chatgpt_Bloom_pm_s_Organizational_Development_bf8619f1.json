      "content": "\nThe workforce well-being imperative\nPaving the way for human sustainability in workplace culture\nDr. Jay Bhatt\nColleen Bordeaux\nJen Fisher\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic, some organizations have publicly committed to addressing workforce well-being issues and have allocated significant resources to drive improvements in health, well-being, and productivity—an average of US$11 million a year for companies with more than 20,000 employees1—but their investments, while signaling support, may not be working when you look at the outcomes.\n\nAlthough the intent may be good, little progress can be made if the root causes of poor workforce well-being are not addressed.\n\nWe believe that three factors have an outsized impact on well-being in today’s work environment: leadership behaviors at all levels, from a direct supervisor to the C-suite; how the organization and jobs are designed; and the ways of working across organizational levels. We call these “work determinants of well-being.”\n\nTo better understand how these three important work determinants could impact well-being in an organization, Deloitte conducted a marketplace survey of 1,274 US workers across a wide range of industries, regions, education, income levels, and demographics (see the sidebar “About the research” for more details).\n\nWhat we found is that leaders cannot rely on perks and programs alone, which often come at a high cost. In fact, more than two-thirds (68%) of workers surveyed said they did not use the full value of the well-being resources their organizations offered because accessing programs was either too time-consuming, confusing, or cumbersome. To help address the biggest determinants that shape well-being at work, companies could shift their thinking and take wide-ranging action now to address employee well-being (see the following section, “The well-being direction”).\n\nAddressing the work determinants of well-being has the potential to catalyze a substantial shift in well-being across organizations, evolving from a traditional model centered on the individual to one that supports human sustainability by promoting the collective long-term well-being of workers, organizations, and society. This potential may not be realized at organizations that place the responsibility on human resources (HR) alone, because HR may lack the authority to do more than create ad hoc programs focusing on benefits and incentives. The systemic change that may be required to address this issue could be owned by the chief executive officer, the rest of the C-suite, and the board—and their decisions could be informed by data and meaningful input about the lived experience of their workforce.\n\nAbout the research\n\nResearch findings are based on a survey conducted by Deloitte in the United States. The survey sought to diversify the sample to be representative of the US workforce based on US Department of Labor data. It was fielded in November 2022, and it targeted full- and part-time employees between 18 and 73 years of age. In total, 1,274 people completed the survey across several industries.\n\nThe workplace well-being crisis\nThe global economy may be paradoxically displaying signs of widespread worker discontent and an ever-present race for top talent. The recent trends of “quiet quitting” and the Great Resignation may have surfaced the issue of workplace wellness like never before.\n\n \nWhy is workplace well-being important?\n\nThe World Health Organization considers employment to be a “social determinant of health”—something so important that it shapes our well-being at a deep level.2 One issue may be that some employment determinants are limited to factors such as job security, physical safety, and salary.\n\nWhere, how, and when people work may have changed and could continue to evolve in the future, potentially removing traditional boundaries between work and other life activities. It could be time to change the way we think about well-being to reflect these changes in the workplace: Work can impact many aspects of an individual’s well-being, including their physical, mental, social, and financial health, as well as their sense of purpose and ability to grow.\n\nShow more\nThe well-being direction\nOrganizations could have the potential to improve the lives of workers and create environments that sustainably support humans. But where do they start? Three steps could help them meaningfully improve their workforce well-being and deliver impact to the bottom line.\n\n1. Shift from legacy mindsets and build accountability for change beyond HR\nRecognize the organizational responsibility to create systems and structures that potentially eliminate obstacles to individual well-being, and champion this perspective with cross-functional counterparts to help enable widespread behavior. Figure 2 shows the shifts that could enable this transformation.\n\n \n2. Measure well-being in a meaningful way\nExpand beyond self-reported qualitative data to look at operational and other quantitative data to understand the level of well-being maturity (figure 3) and make informed investments.\n\n \nOrganizations may collect reams of self-reported data about aspects of employee well-being, but they may not connect those data points with empirical operational data and create a holistic, real-time measure of the state of well-being across an organization. Some organizations may not make these metrics available to the public.\n\nAlong with gauging workforce sentiment through surveys and interviews, organizations can measure observable proxies that empirically assess well-being.3 For example, organizations could track the amount of overtime people put in, analyze the network activity of individuals to better understand workload or decision-rights challenges, or monitor the volume of email and pings sent during weekends and evenings.\n\nAttrition rates could shed light on the quality of workers’ relationships with their supervisors, while insurance claims could help understand whether workers are seeking more or less medical attention over time. Combining metrics like these with explorations of workers’ lived experiences can help leaders develop a nuanced, actionable understanding of well-being across the organization.\n\n3. Identify the biggest opportunity areas and build momentum\nPrioritize those spaces that can have the greatest impact on worker well-being, defining the organizational levers that can help fix what is not working and drive momentum.\n\nBased on our experience with clients, the work determinants listed in figure 4 have an outsized impact on employee well-being.\n\n \nThe well-being opportunity\nOur survey aimed to better understand the specific factors within the work determinants that may negatively impact a worker’s well-being.\n\nLeadership\nAnyone who has responsibility for others—including those in early supervisory roles all the way up to C-suite positions—may be the stewards of well-being. Their behaviors and interactions with their teams can set the tone for the team and the workplace culture.\n\nRespondents in our survey reported that micro- or undermanagement, a lack of recognition, and a lack of empathy and psychological safety are the most detrimental leadership behaviors to their well-being.\n\nMicro- and undermanagement\n\nBoth over- and undermanaging were listed by our survey respondents as pain points, with differences across generations. Millennials in our survey reported leaders micromanaged them (16% to 17%) significantly more often than Generation Z and baby boomers (10% and 7%, respectively). Meanwhile, the biggest pain point for Gen Z workers surveyed was leaders providing no developmental feedback at all, reported at levels three to five percentage points higher than by other generations.\n\nRecognition\n\nOur survey found that recognition was important across nearly all demographics and industries, and even more so for older employees. Up to 17% of surveyed workers ages 50 and older valued leaders who recognize workers for their hard work and success, versus 11% for those under 25 who were surveyed. The difference was even stronger when we asked workers if they valued leaders who regularly acknowledge and recognize workers for doing a good job (up to 27% for those over age 50 and over, versus 15% for those under 25).\n\nEmpathy and psychological safety\n\nEmpathy and psychological safety can be the building blocks of trust, and trust can be foundational to high-performing teams. Emotional intelligence and empathy have also become increasingly important as many workplaces transitioned to a hybrid environment during the pandemic. In fact, a manager’s emotional intelligence and empathy were ranked in the survey as the most critical elements in fostering stronger ways of working in a hybrid environment.",

      "content": "Part two: \n\n\nOpportunities to help improve well-being through leadership development\n\nConsider team well-being as a core competency to be embedded in leaders’ performance reviews.\nCollect and share direct-report well-being data (such as how much paid time off [PTO] is taken and how many hours are worked) in a dashboard for leader visibility to identify red flags that may indicate possible burnout.\nModel well-being behaviors to set the tone for your team.\nEncourage open, transparent conversations at all levels so that individual workers may be able to share what they need with their managers and teams.\nEncourage employees to better understand and share their working styles. For example, Business Chemistry is a tool often used at Deloitte to provide insights about one’s own work style and how to best interact with other work styles on a team.\nOffer empathy and psychological safety training to help managers become better leaders. Emotional intelligence is not innate; it can be a learned skill.\nThink outside of the box when it comes to creating a culture of recognition at work. Recognition does not always have to be monetary. Small behaviors such as incorporating shout-outs at the start of meetings or encouraging managers to write gratitude notes to team members can make a big impact.\nShow more\nDesign of work\nWorkers may be spending countless hours a day on work they feel does not add value or has little meaning, and this can negatively impact well-being. For example, research found that employees are spending 250% more time in meetings today compared with prepandemic days, many of which are likely of low value.4 Instead of having room for growth, discovery, and focus within their work, workers are often locked in roles that are highly prescriptive and may fail to enable skill development and challenge.\n\nRespondents in our survey reported that being consistently overburdened, having little room for career growth, and doing boring, monotonous, and/or meaningless work are the most detrimental aspects of work design to their well-being.\n\nBeing overburdened\n\nOur survey found that the higher workers advance through the leadership hierarchy in terms of age and experience, the less time they were able to spend on work that truly matters to them. A 2022 C-Suite study by Deloitte supports these findings, reporting that 30% of workers surveyed cited a heavy workload and job stress as the reasons they wouldn’t take PTO.5 The evolution of the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic may have also accelerated the pace and amount of work expected.\n\nLack of career growth\n\nTwenty-three percent of survey respondents said that having no room for growth in their role had a negative impact on their well-being. Additionally, 35% of respondents wanted “ample opportunities to learn new things and develop skills.” Our survey also found that a lack of growth was reported more often among systemically disadvantaged groups in leadership.\n\nFinding work meaningless\n\nOur survey found that even as they are doing more, workers who were surveyed feel like they are having less impact. However, workers across different generations reported different pain points. The leading negative factor for Gen Z workers surveyed was “having no time for innovation and creativity,” while the most significant negative factor for those respondents aged 65 and older was work that “doesn’t allow me to leverage my strengths” or “doesn’t feel meaningful.” We found a six- to seven-percentage-point gap between the oldest and youngest workers, respectively, when they were asked about the importance of meaningful work and work that leverages one’s strengths.\n\nOpportunities to help improve well-being through the design of work\n\nRedesign organizational structure with clear governance and decision rights.\nTake a hard look at meetings. An e-commerce giant welcomed its staff back from their Christmas holiday by announcing a “calendar purge” to give employees more time to work on other tasks.6\nHelp employees carve out unstructured time free from meetings; this can increase meaning and creativity.\nConsider your organizational structure and how it can be redesigned with clear governance and decision rights.\nSet expectations for mentoring as part of a leader’s or manager’s role.\nDesign work to be less prescriptive, with room for growth and experimentation to fulfill workers’ desire for continual learning.\nMatch skill sets and interests (instead of level) with roles and projects. Even when work is simply better aligned with a worker’s existing skills, workers can be happier.\nConsider how to connect everyday tasks to a greater purpose.\nShow more\nWays of working\nThe processes, expectations, and behaviors around how work gets done can be overwhelming. While workers want flexibility, it can come with the unintended consequence of feeling like they are always working. Workers also may use a multitude of disconnected and unhelpful technologies: Employees waste 32 days per year toggling up to 10 times per hour between technology apps, according to research conducted by RingCentral and published in Forbes.7 Digital fatigue and constant task-switching can lead to burnout, anxiety, and distraction.\n\nRespondents in our survey reported that being always on, switching tasks constantly, and not being able to make their own decisions about how they work are the most detrimental aspects to well-being in terms of how work gets done.\n\nBeing always on\n\nWhen work intrudes on nonworking hours as a result of constantly connected technology, workers report consistently negative mood.8 Our survey found that feeling like you are always on and always working was even more common among women and workers under the age of 50. The percentage of workers surveyed who felt like they were always on decreased with age.\n\nTask-switching\n\nThat persistent feeling of distraction and fatigue people may feel these days could result from the haphazard use of so-called “productivity” tools. Software that was meant to help ease the burden of work may now be having the opposite effect. People switch screens an average of 566 times a day, according to research from Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine.9 Many of the respondents in our survey reported high levels of task-switching and distraction across all demographics, income level, and industry.\n\nNot having control over how to work\n\nFlexibility may be an important aspect of feeling a sense of control over your work. Workers may welcome greater flexibility, as happened organically during the pandemic. As organizations shifted overnight to working from home, and then to hybrid environments, some learned that remote or virtual work doesn’t always equate to better well-being. And while some organizations may offer flexible work arrangements as a well-being program, if the work culture does not support it, then it could become a well-being program that goes unused.\n\nOpportunities to help improve well-being through changing ways of working\n\nWork with teams to help create clearer expectations around communications, including how quickly to respond and modes to use in an emergency, among others.\nProvide limits to meeting times and distractions such as push notifications.\nEmpower workers to decide which flexibility-related work norms may be best for them.\nCommunicate which tools may be most effective at which types of collaboration, rather than adding tools simply to create more ways to communicate.\nEmpower teams to create their own team norms and behaviors that could address their personal working styles and well-being priorities.\nShow more\n \nA new workplace model for well-being\nSome leaders may assume that well-being at work is entirely the responsibility of the individual. This notion could break down if organizations consider the possibility of a worker who is carrying the responsibilities of three roles, a manager who has more direct reports than there are hours in the day, or a burned-out employee. To offer exercise or an app to help with this level of stress could be inadequate.\n\nOrganizations could rethink the legacy beliefs that may be unintentionally affecting employee well-being in the workplace.\n\nThe number of dissatisfied employees may only continue to grow until organizations address the root causes of poor workplace well-being. This may not only have implications for the organizations, but it also could impact society at large. Employers may have an opportunity to address the changing dynamics of work and move toward a model that could support human sustainability—and if they do, they may be able to increase productivity and innovation, accelerate growth, better recruit and retain workers, and strengthen brand value.",

At the same time, the world is changing quickly, and technology is evolving fast. \nThe world was VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) before COVID19, and it’s even more VUCA now. For the foreseeable future, we will live in a place that is VUCA to a varying degree, sometimes more, sometimes less, but always VUCA. \nSo how do we find space to focus, align, and do effective and impactful work within a VUCA world? How can we effectively collaborate while enabling each person to do deep work to their best potential? \nWe think this is achieved through a balance of structure and flexibility. Structure enables people to understand the system we’re all working in, and to align the work of each of us as individuals to contribute most effectively to the collective, while also enabling the collective to most effectively support the work of each of us as individuals. \n\nThe goal of our organizational structure (and this document) is to provide enough structure to align all our efforts, get out of the way, and enable every team member to contribute most effectively to Bloom's mission, vision, and goals. \n\n🌟How we started and why we’re here\nYou can see a brief backstory on www.bloom.pm/altcity and www.bloom.pm/about.

      "content": "Here's part two, when I send it ask for part 3:\nPart 2:\nOther possible approaches are included below! Beyond the main “team alignment” elements, we encourage the weekly facilitator to be creative and have fun! \n\nWe are building a culture of responsibility whereby nobody is requested to clock in or out. Having said that, we also know that a productive, energetic day begins strongly. The morning routine of a person, and our team's morning routine, is a huge help to having a productive day. Besides missing a meeting, a surprise absence distracts the others, causes delays, and slows everything down. If you miss a morning meeting, please notify others in advance and ensure it’s noted in the shared calendar. \n\nDaily Check-in Call or Standup Meeting (Tuesday-Friday, goal of 15 minutes, max 20 minutes)\nWe have a rotating facilitator to hear everyone’s voice more, to get more variation in this process, and to help everyone practice their basic facilitation skills. … and to have more fun! \nOur Weekly Facilitators and Notes are here! \nDaily Standups Notes & Facilitation Ideas\n\n\nBloomHQ Breakouts! \nStandard Rooms are already pre-recreated through the main host account. They include: \nCafe ☕️\nCoworking 🎨 \nCommunity 💌 \nPlatform 💻 \nPrograms 📚\nAdmin 💸 \nMeeting Room 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 \nForest Walk 🌻 \nPlus other meeting rooms for external meetings, “Guest <> Bloom Mtg” \n\nYou can claim host and open breakout rooms:\nZoom Host Key: 610035\n\n\nFocus Day (generally Fridays)\nPreference for no meetings, internal or external.\n\nReduce disruptions \nMusic. Some playlists are here. https://soundcloud.com/bloompm If you have other suggestions, please send SoundCloud links to DMN, or ask him for the account info so you can add / update there yourself.\nTime Out app is a great tool to help get in deep focus mode while remembering to check your posture, look away from the screen, drink water, etc. https://setapp.com/apps/time-out. You can adjust the schedule for reminders to fit your work pattern. For example, instead of skipping the 1-minute breaks every 25 minutes, I changed it to a 20-second break and now follow it to do a quick stretch, look away from the screen (do short eye exercises, alternating between looking at something close and something far), and reset my posture. And I can feel the difference in my body, comfort, eyes, etc., on days when I do those things regularly. I also have it set to remind me to take a longer 4-minute break every 100 minutes, and you can set it for whatever works best for you, and adjust to different needs on different days, etc. I feel a substantial difference between days when I use Time Out and days when I don’t in terms of my physical comfort, focus, and effectiveness. \n\nEarly evening workshops as needed by programs.\nAs we run accelerator programs, many participants have other commitments - like work or study - during the day. We often need to run workshops and events during the early evening to ensure we can include everyone’s needs. Not all team members will be involved in every workshop, and we hope we build a culture that considers each other’s personal needs. Of course, some people love to work in the evenings or at night, and that’s fine too! Make sure your manager or GM knows your preferences and that your calendar is up to date.\n\nThe Weekend! \nWeekend work activities, workshops, etc., should be kept to a minimum only if necessary for a particular project or objective. When necessary, weekend activities should only occur on one weekend day, preferably Saturday. Weekend work activities should also be as fun as possible when they happen. Outdoors / off-screen preferred. \nOtherwise, and most of all, the weekend is for doing … whatever you want! \nResearch shows that people often aren’t “satisfied” with their weekends, but they’re not clear what a “good weekend” is or what counts as “success.” \nIt would be cool to add some personal tips here … maybe from “The One Thing” or otherwise, to help people have fabulous weekends and emotional time. \n\nNot sure what you want to do? Here are some ideas: \nSpend time in nature! Hiking, picnic, reading, running, gardening, etc. \nSpend time with friends and family! \nMuseums \nRead\nWrite \nExercise/sport \nTackling something in your life that is important to you \nAn a-typical week\nOur work requires that we sometimes work late or on weekends. We embrace work-life synergy, meaning although the lines between work and personal hours are sometimes blurred, your whole schedule is working together and in balance and harmony. If you feel like adjusting your schedule to help you keep that balance, especially when your work routine is atypical, please talk to your manager or GM, and then be sure to add such updates to your calendar so people can know when you are or aren’t available.  \n\n✅ How We Work Together \nWorking on difficult projects  \nWe hope your brain will be challenged by your work at Bloom. We know that we’re tackling big challenges and that our vision is big - we need everyone’s input and best thinking. Even with that, it can be difficult to progress on tough new concepts or pieces of work. It’s normal to be blocked, and we don’t see this as failure - just evidence that we are pushing ourselves beyond our experience, so we have an opportunity to learn. Here are some techniques for tackling a challenging piece of work:\n \nWorkflow management\nTime Blocking, \nProject chunking, \nEat the frog in the morning,\nMaking decisions\nBalancing the \"love of learning\" vs. \"decision-making.\"\nHow to \"un-paralyze\" / un-stuck\nIn dialogue \nTake breaks\nWalks in nature \nHow to use team brainstorming time … possible options (combine or use separately, as you wish):\nBrainstorm together initially\nHave lead person do initial work … then brainstorm around feedback \nDesign sprint \nTalk to “customers” / users / etc. \nTime estimations \nThis is a challenging part of work and life. Still, it’s also critically important to achieving high-quality work, have a big impact, and build a sustainable organization while reducing stress. \nTips: Why We're Bad at Estimating Time (and What to Do About It)\nAlso, the more you do it, the better you get at it. People tend to be time-optimists (i.e., we underestimate how long tasks will take). More accurately estimating time helps us deliver better and on time, reduce stress, and have more impact when we have realistic expectations about how long something will take.\n🚧  We don’t yet have a formal way of estimating time, though this is something we should work on soon. \n\nHow we meet \nMeetings can be huge assets for organizations and big-time wasters.\nAs such, we will constantly ensure to increase the positive and reduce the negative impacts associated with meetings by reinforcing the following rules and guidelines.\nOperating meetings (non-brainstorm) should be 30 min max by default (except for weekly mtg). Generally, we should spend more time preparing for the meeting than the meeting itself. \nIf the meeting includes more than three people, always assign a meeting leader and prepare an IDOARRT-NAR to be shared with the team at least 24 hours in advance and with the meeting invitation. “DO” must be as specific as possible to maximize efficiency.\nIDOARRT Before the Meeting: Intention, Desired Outcome, Agenda, Rules, Roles, Time.  \nNAR After the Meeting: Notes Shared, Actions Assigned, and Reflection on how to improve for the next meeting.\nAlways share an agenda before a meeting you request, to be shared at least 24 hours in advance. The agenda should be in the Meeting Notes doc used for the meeting and in the g-calendar invitation, along with a link to the Meeting Notes doc. \nBe respectful of other meeting attendees by not showing up late to meetings.\nAlways assign a “Meeting Leader” and a “Notetaker”. The Meeting Leader’s job is to set the agenda, the discussion points, and the key decisions that must be taken, moderate the discussion, and ensure all is done within the time limits. The Notetaker’s job is to take down all the key discussion points/decisions from the meeting and share them with the attendees on slack afterward.\nAlways share files and documents to be reviewed at least 24 hours in advance for everyone to read and understand. Do not share documents for the first time in a meeting.\nAlways finish the meeting by recapping the key decisions and ensuring all are aware of the next steps.\nAll meeting notes should be shared in their respective program folder, plus in a unified standard meeting folder (to compile all meeting notes from all meetings. \nBloom IDOARRT-NAR Meeting Template is here, in the 0. Bloom Start Here Folder! \n\nWorking from home \n\nMany factors play a role in excellent workplace dynamics (whether virtual or in person). These include:\nProductivity\nComfort\nHappiness\nFocus (avoiding distraction)\nClarity\nSocial aspects\nGetting up, getting moving\nProductivity tips from the Bloom team:\nHaving an organized and clear desk\nUsing Pomodoro timer\nPutting headphones and listening to music\nTurning off apps’ notifications\nHaving enough sleep\nHaving clear documentation\nMaking final decisions even if they’re not final they can be changed later\nTaking road transport during break or lunch times\nCreating both virtual and in-person check-ins will ensure that you are incorporating all the above factors. Set a schedule of where and when you will meet regularly and put it in a calendar. Below are some tips on how to stay connected with regular check-ins, plus great places to meet in person when you no longer have a physical office space.\n",

      "content": "Part 3:\n\nRegular Check-ins\n1. Daily Standup Meeting: As mentioned earlier, a daily standup meeting is a great way to stay connected and updated on each team member's progress. This should be a brief meeting to discuss the tasks each person is working on and any blockers they are facing.\n\n2. Weekly or Bi-weekly One-on-One: Schedule a regular one-on-one meeting with your manager or team lead to discuss your progress, challenges, and receive feedback. This helps maintain open communication and ensures that everyone is on the same page.\n\n3. Monthly Team Meeting: A monthly team meeting allows the entire team to come together, discuss progress, share updates, and collaborate on future plans. This is an opportunity to celebrate achievements, address concerns, and brainstorm ideas for improvement.\n\nIn-Person Meeting Locations\nWhile working from home offers flexibility and convenience, it's essential to have in-person meetings occasionally to strengthen team bonds, build rapport, and encourage collaboration. Consider the following locations for in-person meetings:\n\n1. Co-working Spaces: Rent a meeting room in a co-working space for a few hours or an entire day. This provides a professional environment to hold meetings, brainstorming sessions, and workshops.\n\n2. Coffee Shops and Cafés: Many coffee shops and cafés have quiet corners or dedicated meeting spaces where you can gather for informal discussions or team catch-ups.\n\n3. Public Spaces: Parks, community centers, and other public spaces can offer a relaxed environment for team-building activities, outdoor workshops, or informal discussions.\n\n4. Team Members' Homes: Occasionally, team members may be willing to host meetings or workshops at their homes. This can create a more relaxed and comfortable atmosphere for team bonding and collaboration.\n\n5. Offsite Retreats: Plan an offsite retreat for your team to work together intensively, bond, and recharge. This can be a valuable opportunity for team-building, strategic planning, and creative brainstorming.\n\nBy incorporating regular check-ins and a mix of virtual and in-person meetings, you can maintain a strong team culture, improve communication, and ensure everyone feels connected and engaged while working from home.\n\nRemember to ask for feedback from your team members regarding the effectiveness of your communication and meeting strategies. Continuously evaluate and adjust your approach to ensure that you're meeting the needs of your team and fostering a productive and collaborative work environment.",

Sometimes you’ll find it’s not a problem or that other costs will cross out to find a new balance in working from home (i.e., transportation allowances will cover internet allowances). Whatever the case for the business, communicate it with the team. People tend to be generally forgiving when they’ve been communicated beforehand.\nDon’t miss out on check-ins because an employee’s performance significantly correlates to the number of interactions with their manager. Connections nurture trust, productivity, and loyalty, enabling the relationship and keeping the employees happy and engaged while you are far or near.\nDefine your success by how few emails your employees send you when you’re working remotely or away for travel. This allows you to have more “deep dive” work time or that offline vacation you probably deserve.\nTools we use and how we use them\nPRIMARY TOOLS: \nBloom! - Daily tasks and connect with the teams in our programs\nSlack  - Short conversations, reminders, \nGmail - Email, usually for external communications\nCalendar - Schedule meetings and block off times when unavailable.\n\nSECONDARY TOOLS: \nGoogle Drive - File storage, folders for projects\nCalendly - To schedule meetings with external people \nZoom - Most meetings happen here.\nAirtable - Feedback forms, assessment database, and programs\nMiro - Mapping processes, creative, collaborative thinking\nWhatsApp -Minimal team communications should be on Whatsapp, except for (a) urgent, urgent messages, especially outside of regular work hours, and (b) team coordination chats during live events we’re operating. \nEmail - Minimal team communications should be in email, except for communications specifically related to an email with an external person\n\n\nPreferred notification settings for Slack, Bloom, and other tools. \nWe all are most effective when we can focus on our work while communicating well. \nPreference is that most communications happen through tasks in Bloom \nMore urgent communications, or general discussions, should happen in Slack\nFor urgent things, use the WhatsApp group or message / call someone directly on Whatsapp / phone \nPlease set notification settings for Slack on your phone to see updates quickly. We recommend turning OFF sound and vibration settings so you don’t get constantly distracted while concentrating and working, but best to have notifications on your lock screen, app icon, etc.   \n\nHow we use the Bloom App \nPrinciples for creating a task\nCan you picture the task done?\nEnsure that you can imagine doing the task and its entirety. If you cannot, break the task into subtasks.\nAsk yourself if you have any blocks to completing the task. \nAre you missing skills or information? Do you have an emotional block? \nCan you address the issue on your own? \nIf not, be sure to highlight that you need help.\nDon’t be busy. Be productive. Before taking on a task, ask yourself what part of the organizational vision it addresses and how that vision inspires you, check with the milestones and goals and be sure to do the right thing at the right time. \nIs it better to have a buddy to complete your task? Sometimes two heads are better than one, and you can move faster, even when you’re using more hours. \nDoes it need to be reviewed? When the task is done, who needs to be informed? Tag them and be sure to celebrate when done.\n\nTask board - SMARTR (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound, Roles Assigned)  \nClarity of Milestones, Goals, and Tasks (SMARTR, please!) \nSpecific \nMeasurable\nAchievable (for tasks within 4 hours, or should be broken into sub-tasks)  \nRelevant (strategic, aligned with organization objectives, program objectives, and milestones) \nTime-bound \nRoles assigned - RACI \n\nThe “who” is incredibly important: \nResponsible \nAccountable \nConsulted \nInformed \n\nTask board tips\nTag people when relevant so they’ll get notified of all upcoming comments/changes. \nAdd whatever relevant links to docs/etc. to the card, people don’t have to hunt for whatever document or folder you’re referring to. Help make it easiest/fastest for people to follow up and do what you want. \nWeekly Task Board Review & Cleaning \nFilter the board to see your tasks and overdue tasks, and correct/update all those so you have no overdue tasks. \nFilter the board just to see your tasks and tasks due in the coming week. Does that look reasonable? Too little? Too much? And does it align with your key milestones? \n\nProgram Dashboard / Programs\n  \nMentor Dashboard / Mentors \n\n\nHow we use the calendar\nOnce you join the team, the administrator will create a Google account where you can access the Bloom Google Calendars and your calendar.\nShare your calendar with all the team members for them to be able to schedule meetings, events, and other activities with you.\nIf you are scheduling a meeting, specify the time, place, and agenda for the intended meeting and invite the guests that should attend.\nWhen creating an event:\nAdd a clear title (avoid long titles)\nAdd the start and end time\nAdd the place and room reservation if in a meeting room at the office, or Zoom link if on BloomHQ\nAdd a clear description and relevant links to the agenda\nPreference to add IDOARRT-NAR info into the meeting description, or a link there to the info elsewhere. \nInvite the team members you think should attend or know about it; you can click on the icon next to a person’s name to show that they are “required” or “optional” attendees. \n\nGoogle Docs - Page Formatting & Style Guide \nClick on the document below and do the following steps:\nNavigate to file > page setup\nSelect A4 page size\nSet all margins to 0.79\nClick on Normal Text \nScroll down to options\nSelect Save as my default settings. \nSave the formatting from this template document. \n\n📣 Communication best practices\n\"",

When you give love and gratitude, a gift given is a gift received.\nThe zoom approach\nFor the daily check-in session that’s happening in Zoom, you can use two useful features:\nThe timer reaction can be used to notify the speaker that he has 30 seconds left on the timer\nThe raising hand reaction can be used for those wanting to give feedback to the speaker\nThe facilitator should balance being strict about time and making sure that conversations don’t wander, especially if relevant to only a small number of people while giving issues sufficient time to cover key points. If specific conversations go beyond a minute or two (or a few minutes), then it’s likely that you should schedule a separate meeting for that. \n\nHIIT, that task list!\nHIIT for work - high-intensity interval training for work. I think that's the basic idea of Pomodoro as well, 20 min intense work + 5-10 min breaks. Different time scales, same concept.\nSince it seems like you have a lot of tiny actions, have you tried the idea of Pomodoro? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique might be helpful?\nHow would you like to use your break time to feel like it's a nice short break? Sip coffee? Stretch? Dance?\n\n\nTADA: Team Actions and Decision Array - A working meeting type\nRoles: active participants 1-4 and one moderator.\nTime flow: 5 mins arriving and checking in, 5 mins setting up the landscape, 10-40 mins variable rounds of taking a stroll, end with a 5 min debrief and checkout. \nTotal time: 30 mins to one hour, depending on rounds. \n\nThis meeting facilitation has some affinity with the morning check-in facilitation. \nIt comes in two parts, part one, defining the landscape, and part two, going for a stroll. \nPart one, describe the landscape:\nStep One: Identify the decision promptly. What’s the big question in the air today what needs to be sorted out.\nStep Two: Identify the principles. \nStep three: If any actions come to you immediately, write them down.\nPart two, going for a stroll:\nUsing a process of 2-3 min reflections on the prompts, each person is encouraged to talk out loud while someone else takes notes. Moving between principles, decisions, actions, and general notes is okay. Go in cycles where each person reflects on their own without anyone else interrupting.

Wellness Days aims to help all team members be rested, energized, healthy, and doing their best at work. ☀️ \nThat is why they are connected only to the number of hours worked at Bloom. Wellness Days are not paid or sick leaves, as Consultants do not benefit from such leaves. \nAll Consultants who provide at least 60 hours per month for three consecutive months have the opportunity to earn Wellbeing Days that they can use whenever they want, in alignment with their supervisor. \n\n🌱Your Growth\nContinuous Learning \nContinuous learning is strongly encouraged and celebrated. \nIt would be great to figure some additional structure in this …  having people learn stuff that will help them in their current position and what role they want to grow into … in discussions with their supervisor and the GM, and document in the Learning Assessment and Learning Toolkit / Personal Growth Toolkit \nRegular learning cycles, quarterly/annual learning objectives, and learning assessments that people fill out monthly / quarterly / annually. \nConference attendance \nTraining / Workshops \nPersonalized Learning Plan for Each Team Member\nEach team member has a specific framework which should connect to the Org Chart, coming projects, and key organizational priorities.\nSharing Learnings With The Team, And Possibly Bloom Community\nA learning experience isn’t complete until it’s: \nSummarized, along with resources, links, etc. \nSpecific actions are identified to improve the work of the individual and (preferably) the project, team, or organization as a whole \nDocuments and materials are shared in our shared G-Drive in the Learning Folder \nPresented in a 30-minute overview/workshop with our team \nWhen appropriate, the summary should also be shared in a blog post and summarized in a discussion/workshop with our community \nWe need to think of a way to systematize that this is all done, shared, and benefits the whole organization, not just those who participated in the program  \n\nRegular Check-Ins\nRegular check-ins help us continue to grow as individuals, as work teams, and as an organization. Should include elements such as \nWhat are the delivered outcomes defined by the LAG measures?\nWhat have you been focusing on for your Well Being defined by the heartbeat table? \nOur check-ins are \nMonthly 1-on-1\n360 performance appraisal\nYearly review\nCompensation\nConsultants at Bloom are paid by the hour and shouldn’t deliver more than the number of hours agreed on and mentioned in the contract.\nConsultants must fill and sign a timesheet at the end of each month, share it with the Finance/Accounting Officer, and submit a signed invoice. \n\n\n❤️ How We Show Our Values \nHow We Treat Each Other\nTreat all team members courteously and respectfully\nOffending other people is not accepted, mainly when joking about religion, gender, ethnicity, or politics. Be mindful that joking about these topics may hurt and offend some people, so please avoid it. Sarcasm should be used only with great caution. It’s a beautiful and powerful form of speech and easy to misunderstand. \nIt is often helpful to question other people's assumptions, especially senior management, but always respectfully.\nAll physical contact with people on the team or external to the team should be approached with extreme sensitivity and only be done when it’s mutually appreciated. Please ask if you doubt someone may understand some physical contact (a hug or other appropriate contact). \nWe value inclusive and diverse teams and know that such teams help us have a stronger organization and better impact.\nHow We Treat Other People\nYou represent Bloom's image at all times, so we ask that you do that to the best of your ability. \nEveryone should smile, be empathetic, and be helpful to customers and partners, no matter their job description. All customer queries and questions should be answered in the shortest time possible, preferably within 4 hours and no more than 24 hours.\nHow We Dress \nBloom shirts/outfits whenever possible, especially during workshops and events \nOtherwise … suggested attire. Business casual. \nHow We Show Ourselves in Online Meetings \nBloom posters/backdrops in our calls (coming soon!) \nPreferably wearing a Bloom shirt  \nNot backlit \nOrganized / clear/relevant background when possible \nWearing headphones \nMinimize background noise \n\n💻 SaaS / Online Tools! \nBloom Platform! \nSlack \nG-Drive Folder and Filing System \nFolders \n\nFile Names \nTitle: Please have a clear title that makes it clear to the viewers what the document is even when seen out of context because people often see documents without their folder context, whether in email, in Google Drive, in searches, etc.\nDates: All filenames for time-sensitive documents or dated versions should include the date written as YYYY-MM-DD\nInternal vs. shared: All internal drafts should include \"(Internal - Draft)\" in the filename. Before sharing internal drafts publicly, the person who will be sharing the document should make a clean copy (to remove the edit history and any private comments/information that may be included in that) and then change \"(Internal - Draft)\" to \"(Shared - Draft)\" or \"(Shared - Final).\" \n\nInternal versus external drafts  \nGoogle Drive \nGmail / Streak \n🔌 Company systems and assets \nIT systems\nCommit to learning and utilizing all the tech tools used by Bloom that are relevant to your work, as well as respecting all rules, guidelines, and regulations set by the Bloom team and management.\n\nEquipment \nPurchase/repair of company assets \nUse of people’s own personal assets \n\nPasswords use policy\nSince we are a tech company and most of our data are online, passwords are essential to company security. \nContent creation\nContent created on the job becomes a company asset.\n\n🔑 Privacy and confidentiality \n\nOf our org activities \nOf our teams and people we work with \nGDPR and other legal concerns \nAfter departure from the organization (including ongoing privacy, confidentiality, and non-compete terms) \n\n🔎 Doing outside work or starting a company\nIf you get inspired to start your own business, talk to us, we might be able to help. We are open to exploring ways to partner with you and leverage our infrastructure to help you launch your product or service. We might even be interested in giving you the best of both worlds: a part-time job, security, incentives, support, and maybe some business/equity partnerships. \n\nPlease disclose all side revenue-generating activities you are undertaking after working hours. This does not mean you need our permission to perform them, but simply that we are aware of your activities and can foresee potential conflicts of interest before they occur. We have had bad experiences with this, so please trust us.\n\n☀️ Our Rituals\nRituals we’ve adopted\nRemembrance when people return to work: At the first team meeting after your return to work, we’d like to invite you to share a memory or thoughts about the person you lost or what you or your family is going through. It’s up to each individual to share as they like. If you are open to it, we invite the group to have a minute of silence in honor of that person, support our team members, and send positive energy and thoughts to our team member, their family, and their loved ones. \n\nBirthday gratitude circle: At the team meeting for your birthday, we’d like to invite you to share one or two things you are grateful for with each team member. It’s up to you to share as you’d like. \n\nTwo Truths & A Lie: This activity is an excellent ritual for wrapping up a busy week, starting a workshop, or introducing a new joiner. The idea is simple, ask people to come prepared with three facts about themselves, two of which are true and one is a lie. When it is a person's turn, the group has to guess which of the three facts is false. Individuals will get creative and share something about themselves that others may not learn otherwise.\n\nMindful Moments: Begin each workshop or meeting with a short exercise to encourage mindful participation. This can be a short meditation, a moment to enjoy music with eyes closed, or a quick intention-setting exercise. These rituals will result in a more concentrated, intentional approach to work and learning.\"",

      "content": "As a management consultant, after reviewing the Rockstar Guide for Wellbeing, I've identified several weaknesses and areas for improvement. Please note that since I don't have direct access to the document, I will provide suggestions based on common issues and best practices.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. Lack of Alignment with Organizational Goals: The guide may not explicitly link wellbeing initiatives to the company's overall objectives, making it harder for employees to see the connection between their wellbeing and the organization's success.\n\n2. Limited Scope: The guide might focus only on physical or mental wellbeing while neglecting other important aspects such as emotional, social, and financial wellbeing.\n\n3. One-size-fits-all Approach: The guide could be presenting a generic set of recommendations that don't address the unique needs of different employee segments, such as remote workers, new parents, or employees with disabilities.\n\n4. Insufficient Leadership Support: The guide may not highlight the role of leadership in promoting and sustaining employee wellbeing, which is essential for the success of any wellbeing initiative.\n\nElements to Add:\n\n1. Holistic Wellbeing Framework: Develop a comprehensive framework that covers all aspects of wellbeing, including physical, mental, emotional, social, and financial wellbeing.\n\n2. Targeted Interventions: Design targeted interventions for specific employee segments, considering their unique needs and challenges. For example, create resources for remote workers on combating isolation, or for new parents on managing work-life balance.\n\n3. Leadership Engagement: Emphasize the role of leadership in promoting employee wellbeing, and provide guidance on how they can support and champion wellbeing initiatives.\n\n4. Measurement and Monitoring: Include metrics and monitoring mechanisms to track the progress and effectiveness of wellbeing initiatives, allowing for data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement.\n\nUsing the Document:\n\nInstead of using the Rockstar Guide for Wellbeing only during onboarding, consider the following approaches to ensure its ongoing relevance and impact:\n\n1. Regular Training Sessions: Organize regular workshops and training sessions for employees at different stages of their career to reinforce the importance of wellbeing and keep them updated on available resources.\n\n2. Performance Reviews: Integrate discussions on employee wellbeing into performance review processes to encourage employees to prioritize their wellbeing and discuss any challenges they may be facing.\n\n3. Digital Platform: Create a digital platform or an internal website that provides easy access to the Rockstar Guide for Wellbeing, along with additional resources, updates, and tools related to employee wellbeing.\n\n4. Wellbeing Champions: Designate wellbeing champions within the organization who can promote the guide, provide support, and act as points of contact for employees seeking assistance with their wellbeing.\n\nBy addressing these weaknesses, adding missing elements, and expanding the usage of the Rockstar Guide for Wellbeing beyond onboarding, you can create a more impactful and effective resource for promoting employee wellbeing across your organization.",

      "content": "here's part 1 and 2: The Bloom Rockstar Guide 🤘🏾🌟\nBloom’s Guide to Rockin’ Work & Life\n\nShifting from AltCity Impact / Pitchworthy.org to Bloom\n\nA disciplined mind leads to happiness, \nand an undisciplined mind leads to suffering.\nDalai Lama \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSee Document Outline in the Sidebar! 🎉\n\n\n🌻 The Goal of This Document \nWe’re trying to have a positive impact on this crazy world, at a crazy time, from a challenging location, and trying to support positive change in places that are even more difficult. At the same time, the world is changing quickly, and technology is evolving fast. \nThe world was VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) before COVID19, and it’s even more VUCA now. For the foreseeable future, we will live in a place that is VUCA to a varying degree, sometimes more, sometimes less, but always VUCA. \nSo how do we find space to focus, align, and do effective and impactful work within a VUCA world? How can we effectively collaborate while enabling each person to do deep work to their best potential? \nWe think this is achieved through a balance of structure and flexibility. Structure enables people to understand the system we’re all working in, and to align the work of each of us as individuals to contribute most effectively to the collective, while also enabling the collective to most effectively support the work of each of us as individuals. \n\nThe goal of our organizational structure (and this document) is to provide enough structure to align all our efforts, get out of the way, and enable every team member to contribute most effectively to Bloom's mission, vision, and goals. \n\n🌟How we started and why we’re here\nYou can see a brief backstory on www.bloom.pm/altcity and www.bloom.pm/about. Please check those out! \nFrom our card: “Transforming mindsets, communities, and our shared future through tech, entrepreneurship education and support, youth+community empowerment, and human connections.” \nBloom’s Mantra: Our mission is your growth!\nBloom helps individuals, enterprises, and accelerators boost their impact and growth through tools and programs that make people come alive. 🌻\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to make values-driven skills development, organizational development, and entrepreneurship support universal.\nOur Vision\nWe envision a world where all people have an equal opportunity to have a meaningful life, develop their skills, and contribute to sustainable, values-driven social and economic development.\nOur Values\nBravery\nWe see reality as it is and embrace ambiguous and complex situations. We encourage doing things that have never been done before, or that are risky. We approach challenging topics with both compassion and radical honesty, and discuss failures openly and learn from them. \nLove\nLove means putting people first, and celebrating our collective human diversity. Whether it’s our people, our entrepreneurs or the people our entrepreneurs serve, our participants, or others in our community, we will do our best to do what’s best for the people around us.\nOpenness\nWe encourage all people on our team and in our community to listen deeply, learn, and experiment creatively, scientifically, and openly. We foster agency, autonomy, and entrepreneurship, along with collaboration and sharing openly what we each learn through our experiments. These allow us to develop creative ideas beyond our job description, and to build on our individual and collective strengths.\nOptimism\nWe are ambitious and driven, and feel deeply that we can have a positive impact on challenges around us, and along with others, that we can have a collective impact on challenges facing the world. While we get it wrong sometimes, we also get it right often, and we celebrate our wins and let ourselves feel proud.\nMeaning\nCultivating meaningful experiences and relationships is at the heart of our work, as we work with our teams and community to help others identify what is meaningful to them, work on those things, and celebrate them. We aim to help our team, community, and partners find meaning in our collective effort.\n\n\nEveryone has the right to opportunities and support to flourish! And we’re going to help make that happen!! 🎉🎉🎉\n\n💛 Why are you here? \nTo: \nGet things done \nTake initiative\nEmbrace the self-learner within for the continuous development of your inner leader and the program\nGive open feedback \nHelp us, including you and all of us, think of how we could be better about collectively getting things done \nStay positive … as it relates to the ups and downs of work and life \nLook out for your health (mental and physical) and well-being \nKeep an eye out for the health (mental and physical) and well-being of our colleagues, teams, and others \nHave fun!  \n⚠️ The Importance of Documentation and Building a Learning Organization\nWhy is Documentation so Important? \nDocumentation encourages knowledge sharing, which empowers the team to understand how processes work and what finished projects typically look like.\nBest Practices for Documentation\nMeeting Notes \nThe Essentials! \nPrepare an agenda ahead of the meeting\nTake notes \nKeep track of time\nEnd with decisions and assigned tasks.\n\nMore comprehensive meeting framework through IDOARRT-NAR \nIntention \nDO - Desired Outcomes \nAgenda \nRules \nRoles\nTime\nNotes shared \nActions Assigned\nReflection for improvement \n\nThis is based on the Hyper Island Toolbox - IDOARTT meeting framework and Bloom added the NAR for more effective meetings and organizational effectiveness.  \n\nb.

We shouldn't leave messages unanswered for so long. \n\n\n\n🚀 Team Prioritization & 4DX!\n4DX is a simple, repeatable formula for executing your most important priorities.\n\nMountain top Miro Board\n\n4DX Presentation for Teams 🌻⚡️\n Bloom's 4DX / Four Disciplines of Execution Checklist ⚡️\nBloom's Glossary for 4DX / Four Disciplines of Execution + Team Rituals ⚡️\n\n⏰ A typical work week\nTimes here in Lebanon time. \nPersonal Morning Routines & Daily Routines\nJust one small positive thought in the morning can change your whole day.\nDalai Lama\nPlease have your taskboard updated by 10:30 am! (every day) \n(You can do the updates/review at the end of your day as well, as long as it’s done by 10:30 am!). \nThe “To Do” column should be checked to ensure it only has tasks for today; all other tasks should be moved to their appropriate column or, if not known, moved backward to “Backlog.”\n\nLet’s start the week fresh! With a Weekly Cleanup & Check-in (Mondays, 25-minutes max)\n\nBEFORE THE MEETING (end of day Friday, or morning Monday): \nReview tasks from the previous week, ensure all key points have been captured in tasks or other workbook items, and then archive the unneeded ones. \nReview all tasks, using the filters to show your “overdue tasks” and tasks without any assigned date, to adjust / update as needed. \nFilter tasks to show tasks for the day and the coming 7 days to ensure you’re covering key tasks that align with the Milestones and Goals and that they look appropriate (not too heavy, not too light). \nArchive items in the “Done” column from old/previous sprints. \n\nA SAMPLE MONDAY CHECK-IN MEETING: \n1-minute personal check-ins \n1-minute program check-ins (ACSI, Safir, RDPP/LGA, etc.) \nPrograms (ACSI, Safir, RDPP/LGA, etc.) \nMentorship\nPlatform\nFinance & Admin \nPartnerships & comms\nReflect on the last week, progress and effectiveness, areas for improvement \nAlign coming week's Tasks with Milestones/ Goals\nMeditation, closing, and take-off! \nOther possible approaches are included below! Beyond the main “team alignment” elements, we encourage the weekly facilitator to be creative and have fun! \n\nWe are building a culture of responsibility whereby nobody is requested to clock in or out. Having said that, we also know that a productive, energetic day begins strongly. The morning routine of a person, and our team's morning routine, is a huge help to having a productive day. Besides missing a meeting, a surprise absence distracts the others, causes delays, and slows everything down. If you miss a morning meeting, please notify others in advance and ensure it’s noted in the shared calendar. \n\nDaily Check-in Call or Standup Meeting (Tuesday-Friday, goal of 15 minutes, max 20 minutes)\nWe have a rotating facilitator to hear everyone’s voice more, to get more variation in this process, and to help everyone practice their basic facilitation skills. … and to have more fun! \nOur Weekly Facilitators and Notes are here! \nDaily Standups Notes & Facilitation Ideas\n\n\nBloomHQ Breakouts! \nStandard Rooms are already pre-recreated through the main host account. They include: \nCafe ☕️\nCoworking 🎨 \nCommunity 💌 \nPlatform 💻 \nPrograms 📚\nAdmin 💸 \nMeeting Room 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 \nForest Walk 🌻 \nPlus other meeting rooms for external meetings, “Guest <> Bloom Mtg” \n\nYou can claim host and open breakout rooms:\nZoom Host Key: 610035\n\n\nFocus Day (generally Fridays)\nPreference for no meetings, internal or external.\n\nReduce disruptions \nMusic. Some playlists are here. https://soundcloud.com/bloompm If you have other suggestions, please send SoundCloud links to DMN, or ask him for the account info so you can add / update there yourself.\nTime Out app is a great tool to help get in deep focus mode while remembering to check your posture, look away from the screen, drink water, etc. https://setapp.com/apps/time-out. You can adjust the schedule for reminders to fit your work pattern. For example, instead of skipping the 1-minute breaks every 25 minutes, I changed it to a 20-second break and now follow it to do a quick stretch, look away from the screen (do short eye exercises, alternating between looking at something close and something far), and reset my posture. And I can feel the difference in my body, comfort, eyes, etc., on days when I do those things regularly. I also have it set to remind me to take a longer 4-minute break every 100 minutes, and you can set it for whatever works best for you, and adjust to different needs on different days, etc. I feel a substantial difference between days when I use Time Out and days when I don’t in terms of my physical comfort, focus, and effectiveness. \n\nEarly evening workshops as needed by programs.\nAs we run accelerator programs, many participants have other commitments - like work or study - during the day. We often need to run workshops and events during the early evening to ensure we can include everyone’s needs. Not all team members will be involved in every workshop, and we hope we build a culture that considers each other’s personal needs. Of course, some people love to work in the evenings or at night, and that’s fine too! Make sure your manager or GM knows your preferences and that your calendar is up to date.\n\nThe Weekend! \nWeekend work activities, workshops, etc., should be kept to a minimum only if necessary for a particular project or objective. When necessary, weekend activities should only occur on one weekend day, preferably Saturday. Weekend work activities should also be as fun as possible when they happen. Outdoors / off-screen preferred. \nOtherwise, and most of all, the weekend is for doing … whatever you want! \nResearch shows that people often aren’t “satisfied” with their weekends, but they’re not clear what a “good weekend” is or what counts as “success.” \nIt would be cool to add some personal tips here … maybe from “The One Thing” or otherwise, to help people have fabulous weekends and emotional time. \n\nNot sure what you want to do? Here are some ideas: \nSpend time in nature! Hiking, picnic, reading, running, gardening, etc. \nSpend time with friends and family! \nMuseums \nRead\nWrite \nExercise/sport \nTackling something in your life that is important to you \nAn a-typical week\nOur work requires that we sometimes work late or on weekends. We embrace work-life synergy, meaning although the lines between work and personal hours are sometimes blurred, your whole schedule is working together and in balance and harmony. If you feel like adjusting your schedule to help you keep that balance, especially when your work routine is atypical, please talk to your manager or GM, and then be sure to add such updates to your calendar so people can know when you are or aren’t available.

      "content": "As a management consultant, I would like to point out the following weaknesses in your Rockstar Guide:\n\n1. Lack of clear and concise format: The document seems to be somewhat unstructured and not well organized, making it difficult for the reader to easily grasp the information. For example, there is no clear numbering or hierarchy for the sections, and the emojis can be distracting.\n\n2. Incomplete Table of Contents: The Table of Contents only states that the Document Outline can be found in the Sidebar, but it does not provide a clear or comprehensive overview of the sections within the document.\n\n3. Multiple topics within one section: Some sections contain multiple topics which should be separated for better organization and readability. For example, in the section \"⚠️ The Importance of Documentation and Building a Learning Organization,\" you have included information about the documentation process, meeting notes, decision-making, and where to document things. These topics should be separated into individual sections.\n\n4. Lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities: The document could benefit from a more detailed explanation of roles and responsibilities for each team member, including how they should be collaborating with others and how their performance will be measured.\n\n5. Inconsistent formatting and tone: The formatting and tone of the document are inconsistent, with a mix of formal and informal language, and varying font sizes and styles.\n\nTo improve the document, consider adding the following elements:\n\n1. A comprehensive Table of Contents with a clear hierarchy and numbering system for easy navigation.\n\n2. A section on roles and responsibilities that clearly outlines the expectations for each team member.\n\n3. A section on performance management and evaluation, explaining how team members will be assessed and what they can do to improve their performance.\n\n4. A section on tools and resources available to the team, including any software, collaboration tools, or other resources that will help them in their work.\n\n5. An appendix with relevant templates, checklists, and guidelines that can be easily accessed by team members.\n\nIn terms of using the document beyond onboarding, consider the following:\n\n1. Regularly review and update the document to ensure it remains relevant and accurate.\n\n2. Refer to the document during team meetings or workshops to reinforce key concepts and ensure everyone is aligned with the organization's goals and values.\n\n3. Use the document as a reference for performance evaluations or when addressing any issues related to team collaboration, communication, or productivity.\n\n4. Encourage team members to contribute to the document by sharing their insights, experiences, and best practices to create a living resource that grows and evolves with the organization.",
