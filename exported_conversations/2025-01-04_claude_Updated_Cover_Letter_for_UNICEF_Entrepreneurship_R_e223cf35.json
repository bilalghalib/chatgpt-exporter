            "extracted_content": "You raise good points about needing clarity on several key elements. Let me help formulate specific questions we need answers for to create an accurate financial proposal:\n\nTravel Requirements:\n\nIs physical presence required in Egypt or can coordination with Egypt Country Office be done remotely?\nAre any other country visits expected/required?\nWill there be any mandatory in-person meetings at UNICEF NYHQ?\nDocumentation & Language:\n\nAre deliverables required in both English and Arabic?\nDo they expect translation costs to be included in the budget?\nWhat format do they expect for the \"financial proposal\" document - simple budget table or detailed narrative with justifications?\nOperational Clarity:\n\nWill GenU provide access to their existing platforms/tools, or should we budget for using external ones?\nFor the capacity-building sessions and webinars - who handles the technical logistics (Zoom accounts, etc.)?\nAre there any specific reporting templates or formats they require?\nTime Allocation:\n\nGiven the 90-day maximum, should we break down exactly how many days are allocated per deliverable?\nDo they need justification for why certain deliverables require more days than others?\nAdditional Budget Elements Often Expected in UN Consultancies:\n\nInsurance costs (if not covered)\nCommunication costs (internet, phone)\nOffice/workspace costs (if any)\nSoftware licenses needed for deliverables\nAny required training/certification costs\nContingency percentage (if allowed)\nWould you like me to help draft specific questions to GenU to clarify these points?

I dont wanna be greed yand i want to be professional and do what is standard in the industry for international consultants\n\nLet me help refine the financial proposal based on your feedback and the UNICEF requirements. You raise good points about keeping it professional yet straightforward.\n\nFor the travel component: Yes, while actual travel costs will be reimbursed separately, it's good practice to indicate planned travel in the proposal to show you've thought through the full scope. We can add a note like: \"Anticipate 2-3 visits to Egypt Country Office for stakeholder engagement and model alignment (exact dates TBD, costs to be reimbursed per UNICEF policy).\"\n\nFor the day rate: Industry standard is to have your day rate be inclusive of basic operational costs (communication, software, etc.). This keeps the proposal cleaner and more professional. We can note: \"Daily rate is inclusive of standard operational costs (communication, software licenses, etc.).\"\n\nLet's break down the 90 days across deliverables based on the timeline they provided:\n\n\nCopy\nJanuary - February 2025 (15 days)\n- Comprehensive mapping report\n- Initial stakeholder engagement\n- System assessment\n\nMarch - April 2025 (20 days)\n- Integrated support system design\n- Portfolio strategy development\n- Portfolio management framework\n\nMay - July 2025 (25 days)\n- Incubation system toolkit\n- Follow-on funding strategy\n- Egypt Country Office model enhancement\n\nAugust - October 2025 (20 days)\n- Knowledge products\n- Capacity building sessions\n- Technical proposals development\n\nNovember - December 2025 (10 days)\n- Webinars/learning events\n- Results framework\n- Final documentation\nWould you like me to draft a clean version of the financial proposal incorporating these elements? We can keep it professional and aligned with UN standards while avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\nOne question: Would you prefer to stick with the $350/day rate or should we adjust it given the strategic nature of many deliverables? The current total ($31,500) is at the very bottom of their range ($31,500-$160,500).\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nthat salary is per year, so what is it per day and how high or low am i? let's go for a higher range 150,000 / 260 days a year is about 575 so 575*90= 51750 - maybe i can go for 40/45? 42? what do you think? Should I bill dynamically for different kinds of work or a flat fee per day?I want to be competetive \neven though there's just 10 days for webinars/learning events we need some days sprinkled in other months to get outreach developed, and i'm sure other content will \"bleed\" form one output deliverable moment to earlier ones likely to be sure we get a head start on things no?\nyeah, let's make a clean version of the financial proposal\n\n\nYou make a good point about the annual salary conversion and activity overlap. Let's break this down:\n\nRate Calculation:\nMarket range: $31,500-$160,500/year\nYour target of ~$45,000 for 90 days = $500/day\nThis positions you well - experienced but competitive\nA flat rate is cleaner and more professional than variable rates\nTimeline Consideration: Yes, we should definitely show how activities overlap and build on each other. For example, while the webinars are delivered in November, the preparation and outreach would start earlier.\nLet me draft a clean financial proposal:\n\n\nCopy\nFINANCIAL PROPOSAL\nEntrepreneurship Consultant - Generation Unlimited (GenU)\n\nPROFESSIONAL FEES\nDaily Rate: $500 USD\nTotal Days: 90\nTotal Professional Fees: $45,000 USD\n\nALLOCATION OF DAYS AND DELIVERABLES\n\nJanuary - February 2025 (20 days)\nPrimary Focus:\n- Comprehensive mapping report\n- Initial stakeholder engagement\nSupporting Activities:\n- Early planning for knowledge products\n- Initial outreach for webinar series\n\nMarch - April 2025 (25 days)\nPrimary Focus:\n- Integrated support system design\n- Portfolio strategy development\n- Portfolio management framework\nSupporting Activities:\n- Continued stakeholder engagement\n- Preliminary work on incubation toolkit\n\nMay - July 2025 (25 days)\nPrimary Focus:\n- Incubation system toolkit\n- Follow-on funding strategy\n- Egypt Country Office model enhancement\nSupporting Activities:\n- Webinar content development\n- Knowledge product preparation\n\nAugust - December 2025 (20 days)\nPrimary Focus:\n- Knowledge products delivery\n- Capacity building sessions\n- Webinar series execution\n- Results framework development\nSupporting Activities:\n- Ongoing documentation\n- Final report preparation\n\nNotes:\n1.

I bring over 15 years of experience designing and implementing youth-focused entrepreneurship programs across the MENA region. My background combines building entrepreneurial ecosystems, developing innovative learning methodologies, and creating scalable support systems, with a focus on youth resilience and sustainable development.\nI recently completed a project with the International Trade Center in Iraq focused on entrepreneurship in green and sustainable housing in a post-conflict setting. I conducted literature reviews, interviews, and framework analysis and developed a heritage innovation curriculum for environmentally conscious housing solutions. Previously, I founded Bloom.pm, where we've supported over 950 entrepreneurs across 16 countries using an assessment-driven methodology that enables customized learning journeys. Our approach has consistently achieved a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating while demonstrating measurable improvements in the resilience and success rates of entrepreneurs.\nMy experience is particularly relevant to GenU's objectives in several key areas:\nPortfolio Management & Support Systems: I've developed the Bloom platform, which integrates assessment tools, progress tracking, and targeted interventions. This enables program managers to support larger programs while maintaining personalized attention. Multiple accelerators have successfully adopted this system through our training-of-trainers programs.\nRegional Expertise: Having worked extensively throughout MENA, including Egypt and recently in Iraq, I understand the unique challenges and opportunities for youth entrepreneurship in the region. I conduct workshops in Arabic and have deep connections with entrepreneurship support organizations across the ecosystem I’ve been supporting since 2011.\nResearch-Backed Methodology: My master's research at Learning Planet Institute focused on post-traumatic growth in entrepreneurship contexts, leading to evidence-based approaches for building resilience in youth entrepreneurs. This research has informed program designs that improve outcomes, particularly in challenging environments.\nGreen Skills Integration: At Bloom, we’ve run many programs focused on sustainable entrepreneurship, including the HerMeNow accelerator supporting green solutions across MENA and Africa. Working with the UN ITC's sustainable housing initiative in Iraq gave me a deeper insight into connecting entrepreneurship and sustainability. This experience directly aligns with GenU's focus on green thematic pathways.\nI am particularly excited about contributing to GenU's mission of youth empowerment through entrepreneurship. My daily rate is $400, with a total project cost of $100,000 (inclusive of travel and expenses). I am available to begin on January 10th, 2025, and am prepared to meet all deliverables outlined in the Terms of Reference.\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience designing resilient entrepreneurship ecosystems can contribute to GenU's vision of nurturing the next generation of innovators.\nSincerely, \nBilal Ghalib bilal@bloom.pm | +1 (478) 227-2253\n\n\nFinancial Proposal - Generation Unlimited (GenU) Entrepreneurship Consultant\nProfessional Summary\nBuilding on 15 years of experience implementing youth-focused entrepreneurship programs across MENA, including the development of Bloom.pm's assessment-driven methodology that has supported 950+ entrepreneurs across 16 countries, I propose the following implementation plan and budget.\n\nProfessional Fees\nDaily Rate: $375 USD\nTotal Days: 90\nTotal Professional Fees: $33,750 USD\nDeliverable Breakdown & Timeline\nDeliverable\tDays\tAmount (USD)\tDue Date\tDescription\nComprehensive Mapping Report\t8\t$3,000\tFeb 15, 2025\tMapping of GenU entrepreneurship initiatives with stakeholder analysis and gap identification, leveraging regional ecosystem knowledge\nIntegrated Support System Design\t8\t$3,000\tMar 5, 2025\tOperational plan incorporating Bloom's proven assessment-driven methodology for personalized entrepreneurial support\nPortfolio Strategy Development\t10\t$3,750\tMar 31, 2025\tStrategic framework integrating green pathways and youth-focused approaches based on MENA experience\nPortfolio Management Framework\t8\t$3,000\tApr 22, 2025\tMonitoring and evaluation system drawing from research-backed resilience metrics\nIncubation System Toolkit\t8\t$3,000\tMay 14, 2025\tStructured approach for mentorship and capacity building, informed by post-conflict context experience\nFollow-on Funding Strategy\t8\t$3,000\tJun 12, 2025\tPartnership and investment framework leveraging existing MENA networks\nEgypt CO Model Enhancement\t8\t$3,000\tJul 10, 2025\tIntegration roadmap aligned with imaGen Ventures framework\nKnowledge Products\t8\t$3,000\tAug 28, 2025\tCase studies showcasing entrepreneurship innovations and best practices\nTechnical Funding Proposals\t8\t$3,000\tSep 19, 2025\tThree proposals for scaling entrepreneurship programs\nCapacity Building Sessions\t6\t$2,250\tOct 24, 2025\tFour workshops delivered in Arabic and English\nWebinar Series\t5\t$1,875\tNov 18, 2025\tThree webinars on entrepreneurship, green skills, and funding\nResults Framework\t5\t$1,875\tDec 31, 2025\tMonitoring framework with defined indicators and tracking tools\nImplementation Approach\nRemote delivery with strategic in-person engagement at Egypt Country Office\nBilingual capacity (English/Arabic) ensuring effective regional engagement\nIntegration of proven assessment tools and resilience-building methodologies\nLeverage of existing MENA entrepreneurship networks\nNotes\nDaily rate includes standard operational costs (communication, software licenses)\nTravel costs will be reimbursed separately per UNICEF policies\nHealth insurance secured through French national system\nAvailable to commence work on January 10, 2025\nPayment Schedule\n20% upon contract signing ($6,750)\n30% upon completion of strategy deliverables - April 2025 ($10,125)\n30% upon completion of Egypt office model - July 2025 ($10,125)\n20% upon completion of all deliverables - December 2025 ($6,750)\nWould you like me to adjust any aspect of this proposal?\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\n\nScope of Work: 1. Development of Entrepreneurship Portfolio Strategy Conduct a comprehensive mapping of all entrepreneurship initiatives within GenU. Deliverable: One consolidated mapping report wi\npasted\nBG\nwhat exactly are my 4 workshops going to be about? can we look at their needs and ask me questions to see what I should do because I don't know about promising an operational plan incorporating blooms proven assessment driven method, I think we need to develo pa new plan to acheive the deliverables ask me questions so we can make a new plan and timeline to do this:\n\n\nYou raise a good point about needing to clarify the specifics before committing to particular methodologies. Let me ask some key questions to help us develop a more precise implementation plan:\n\nMapping & Systems Development:\nHow would you approach mapping GenU's existing entrepreneurship initiatives without prior knowledge of their internal systems?\nWhen they ask for an \"integrated support system,\" what are your initial thoughts on what that might entail?\nAbout the Workshops & Capacity Building: Looking at their scope, they seem to need training around:\nPortfolio management systems\nIncubation and mentorship approaches\nFunding mechanisms\nMonitoring and evaluation What specific expertise could you bring to each of these areas based on your experience?\nEgypt Country Office Focus:\nWhat would you need to learn about imaGen Ventures and ROTA/Silatech before committing to enhancing their model?\nHow would you approach learning about their current systems while developing improvement recommendations?\nTechnical Systems Development:\nRather than promising to use Bloom's system, what components of your experience in building support systems would be most relevant?\nWhat questions would you ask GenU about their current technical infrastructure?\nKnowledge Products: They want three products showcasing best practices. Based on your experience:\nWhat types of case studies or knowledge products have you found most useful for similar organizations?\nWhat format works best for sharing entrepreneurship learnings across different contexts?\nWould you like to tackle these questions one at a time to build a more specific implementation plan?\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nAlright. So for mappings systems and development, how would I approach mapping Genu's entrepreneurship initiatives? Well, I'd get some knowledge, and I'd start getting on phone calls I'd, developed my content relationship management, CRM, documents, for the on Airtable, probably. I'll set up a call a Calendly link and schedule and I'll, start reaching out and, you know, of course, like, reading all the documentation and all the paperworks, I don't exactly know what an integrated support system means. So an integrated support system for whom exact Let's see if we can figure that out. Integrated Yeah. Create a support system. Mapping entrepreneurship. Okay. Create a support system. Building an entrepreneurship portfolio strategy, Yeah. So the entrepreneurship portfolio strategy is a great idea, and there's, like, a lot of places for it. For instance, there's stuff that the Learning Planet Institute's doing with the LPI project page and other places and just on the Genu website. I feel like there's gotta be a something between systematizing and making things available, in a database that's queryable through a cumbersome model, but Also, training people to be able to tell their stories, run their Instagrams, share common hashtags, build real dynamic community support. It's like, how do you find things these day? It's actually important to try to create some both structure and flexibility and autonomy for people to be able to do things and to be able to feel like they are part of something greater integrated, harmonized incubation mentorship, and funding support. So integrated support system can be the similar to something around the Bloom platform. You know, we've developed a lot of common assessments, the the Ontracomp, the enterprise, capacity assessment the ECAT that we do, that helps us create a common library of activities and support that's actually probably a really great integrated support system and we've already kind of built a lot of that. And we have a common structure for activities and common tags that span between personal and professional growth and, resilience and flourishing have all of these different assessments that we already use that I can probably, utilize for their, initiatives Android they have different software or different approaches that they wanna take, by all means, but we have our platform ready and available. Workshop capacity building, looking at their scope, training around portfolio management systems. Yeah. So, you know, I know a little bit about HubSpot and also I'm really good at Airtable and, there are I'm not sure exactly what a portfolio management assistant is. Like, we can actually roll our own using software and Airtable so that people can actually update their own content, you know, forms. Just gotta make it really easy for people. And I think it's really important also to have a portfolio that is Trustable and alive and also supports community building. So the idea of if you don't update your stuff once a year, you get removed know, I've been a part of the global entrepreneurship and sorry, the global innovation gathering for a while, and we have a, you know, it's could be as simple as a WordPress and a portfolio thing, but there's a community manager, and so that could be something that I recommend. For them. To have someone that actually keeps tabs on things and sets up regular activities and events virtual things so that people around the world can join and maybe, like, it could be like a lottery there's 1,000,000 or 1,000 of, young entrepreneurs we have a lottery for presenting and maybe we send that lottery out to a 1000 people a month, and we pick 10 people if they respond. And then the people that don't respond we kind of demote their thing to a, like, hiatus page, and then the ones that respond are active, again, and they can update some stats. Maybe they can update if they hired people. They can update their impact and stuff like that. I think that would be great. Funding mechanisms I think, yeah, we need, tag participants by their Claude areas, a lot of funders are interested in different, impact measures and impact causes and it can be a gallery it's the same thing with the portfolio and the funding. You know, the we just need a content management system that has different types of people, investors, startups, and businesses. Mentors, trainers, all sorts of, different roles. And then somehow creating public and, private ways of engaging with things depending on, the investors' interests. And it really depends on the technology platform that they're comfortable with, but I have a lot of experience with things like HubSpot and, Airtable and rolling my own databases and even WordPress but it just has to be as easy as possible for people And in a place where it's really easy for them to Connect. Would I need to learn? Yes. I need to learn a lot more about Image Ventures. I'm some research on them online. I love what they're doing. It seems like they're having amazing and large scale impact. With young people around the world and I'm excited to get connected, but I don't know much about it, but definitely need to do background research I'd love to talk with people and, have, you know, a download. Yeah. So I have my recommendations, and so we can probably you know, develop the same kind of literature review or curriculum review or framework review and find alignments. I always like to find, synonyms and having these kinds of things are we're trying to measure the same real thing, and in the end, we just need to find the synonyms and, agree agree upon them. And there are a lot of standards and the the UNICEF is a part of the EU. Right? I think it is. I'm not sure. If it's not a part of the EU, or the UN, it doesn't matter, but, like, the UN has the, entra comp for the entrepreneurial capacities and there's all sorts of know, 21st century skills and other skill, like, frameworks that we've been trying to align with for ages so we can align with them as well. What questions did I ask about the technical infrastructure? Yeah. Like, what do they use for their databases? I guess is easy knowledge products. If they want these products, Most useful for similar organizations. So Knowledge products. Entrepreneurial, entrepreneurship learnings across different contexts. Yeah. I think best thing to do is to find this closest and most similar context What types of case studies or knowledge products not even sure what that means. Yeah. So you know, like having case studies, I really like ChangeX's model where it shows you, like, the step by step of how to start. So you can think, oh, I wanna start a business and like, here's a package and you you get it and then know, it tells you step 1, step 2, find cofounders, do this, do that, and then they unlock funds along the way. That's really cool. I I really like that. And I feel like the most helpful thing is kinda community and getting online and and connecting and sharing stories and trusting yourself as an entrepreneur and building self efficacy and these types of things that are really internal rather than external And, format for sharing entrepreneurship learning is about different context. Definitely online sessions. And getting people into breakouts 1 on 1 with a person who's 1 step ahead of them, not 10 steps ahead of them, not a mentor who's already, like, managing a giant company, but someone that's just one step ahead of them in the entrepreneurial journey and get them into breakout rooms and online sessions.\n\n\nThank you for this detailed stream of consciousness! Let me organize these insights into a clearer implementation plan, and then ask some follow-up questions to refine it.\n\nProposed Implementation Framework:\n\nMapping & Knowledge Management\n\nCopy\n- Set up Airtable-based CRM for stakeholder mapping\n- Create systematic outreach plan (Calendly + structured calls)\n- Build living documentation system\n- Implement \"active/hiatus\" status system to keep data fresh\nIntegrated Support System Approach\n\nCopy\n- Community-First Design:\n  * Dynamic content sharing (Instagram, hashtags)\n  * Peer connections (1-step-ahead mentoring)\n  * Regular virtual engagement opportunities\n- Assessment Framework:\n  * Leverage existing tools (Enterprise Capacity Assessment)\n  * Align with standard frameworks (EntreComp, 21st century skills)\nPortfolio & Community Management\n\nCopy\n- Active Community Management:\n  * Regular virtual events\n  * Rotating presentation opportunities\n  * Engagement-based status updates\n- Impact Tracking:\n  * Simple update forms\n  * Regular milestone tracking\n  * Impact measurement aligned with funder interests\nFollow-up Questions:\n\nTechnical Integration:\nIf GenU already has systems in place, how would you approach integration vs. building new?\nWhat's your experience migrating data between different platforms?\nEgypt Office Specifics:\nHow would you structure the initial discovery phase with imaGen Ventures?\nWhat timeline would you need for proper assessment before making recommendations?\nWorkshop Content: Given your emphasis on peer learning and one-step-ahead mentoring:\nHow would you structure the four required capacity-building sessions?\nWhat's your vision for balancing technical skills vs. community building?\nAssessment Framework:\nHow would you manage the potential tension between standardized frameworks (EntreComp) and localized needs?\nWhat's worked best in your experience for balancing structure vs. flexibility?\nKnowledge Products: You mentioned ChangeX's step-by-step model:\nCould you describe a specific structure for the three required knowledge products?\nHow would you incorporate both practical steps and the internal development aspects you highlighted?\nWould you like to tackle any of these questions first to help refine the implementation plan?\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nlet's see what they have i don't htink i need to go into that much detail, maybe just put assess current tech platform / anticipate integration or something more professional like that I can migrate just fine, I'm a coder\nonline calls, i'd love to meet people as soon as possible or host focus group discussions online and individual 1-1s and share working docs openly We could take the assessments we've developed for training of the trainers - we call it the ACAT - accelerator capacity assessment test and leverage lessons learned from the SAFIR project\nI'd love your recommendations for the 4 sessions. I think maybe we can use the four tiered session they want things for mentorship - we have a mentorship onboarding and mentor process at Bloom - i'd love to train people on the personal/professional growth (we can frame it as resilience and flourishing promoting entrepreneurship for structured incubation system. principles for a resilieince and flourishing for entrepreneurs including key things to keep top of mind to promote, self efficacy, community and open sharing, and deep connection to meaning (we start with why) - he he has a strong enough why can overcome any how.\nAllow people to take a core streamlined assessment so there's comperable data yet also add/update questions for themeslves - why else do you think? emphasize a minimum kernel of similar content and then allow dynamic things atop it\nKnowledge products are likely to be a simple digital platform, notion, airtable, etc with dashboards - i think the knowledge products should be cocreated with the youth through story telling workshops, getting people to the core of their missions and voting on who shared best practices that were most inpsiring and transferrable etc I could connect the knowledge products with the outreach component and have it also be the early part of gathering insights as to who might be great to co-facilitate the webinars and learning events, if we find highly engaged folk, the best way to learn is to teach, I'd like to mentor and coach youth on becoming sharers of their knowledge, deepening their insights and increasing authenticity and reliability of the workshop, we can do the sessions together with me hosting the main content and youth presenting as well, building more community, and building empowerment. living my values of community and agency within the way i do my work. I think i'm having some good ideas, a bit messy if you can help with that and see the things that i can't really see yet are right at the edge of possibility here that aligns with the direction of my thinking and working and still fits the outcomes they want and work they need\n\n"

With over 15 years of experience designing youth-focused entrepreneurship programs across MENA, I bring expertise in building resilient support systems that emphasize participant agency, community building, and measurable impact.\n\nYouth-Centered Program Development\nAs founder of Bloom.pm, I developed methodologies that supported over 950 entrepreneurs across 16 countries by starting with their \"why\" - their core purpose and motivation. This approach, which maintains a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating, creates spaces where young entrepreneurs actively shape their learning journey. My research on post-traumatic growth among entrepreneurs following the Beirut blast has shown that when youth feel agency in their entrepreneurial journey, they develop stronger resilience and achieve more sustainable outcomes.\n\nRegional Expertise & Language Capacity\nMost recently as a Sustainability Curriculum Consultant with the International Trade Center in Mosul, I facilitated Arabic-language workshops focused on green entrepreneurship in post-conflict settings. Having worked extensively throughout MENA since 2011, including significant time in Egypt, I understand how to create culturally resonant programs that amplify youth voices while meeting institutional objectives.\n\nCo-Creation & Community Building\nMy approach emphasizes peer learning and youth leadership. Rather than traditional top-down training, I create frameworks where young entrepreneurs become active contributors - leading storytelling sessions, sharing best practices, and building supportive networks. This philosophy would strengthen GenU's knowledge products by ensuring they reflect authentic youth experiences and insights.\n\nTechnical Integration & Innovation\nI bring experience training social enterprises and nonprofits on the ethical application of AI, along with expertise in developing engaging portfolio management systems. At Bloom, we found that combining regular community storytelling events with practical incentives (like featured spotlights and investor connections) helps maintain active participation and provides valuable impact data.\n\nImplementation Philosophy\nI propose a delivery approach that:\n- Centers youth voices in program design and knowledge sharing\n- Builds sustainable communities through peer support and shared learning\n- Uses technology thoughtfully to track impact while fostering engagement\n- Creates meaningful connections between entrepreneurs and resources\n\nFor this consultancy, my daily rate is $400, with a total project cost of $36,000 (excluding travel and reimbursables). I am available to begin on January 10th, 2025, and am prepared to meet all deliverables outlined in the Terms of Reference while ensuring young entrepreneurs remain at the heart of every initiative.\n\nThank you for considering my application.

I welcome the opportunity to support GenU’s portfolio by designing integrated support systems, strengthening follow-on funding, and aligning local frameworks with existing regional methodologies such as imaGen Ventures and ROTA/Silatech.\n\nRelevant Experience & Alignment\nSystematic Mapping & Strategy: At Bloom.pm, I led comprehensive mapping exercises and developed data-driven operational plans to manage large-scale entrepreneur cohorts. This experience directly supports GenU’s mapping and integrated support system deliverables.\nIncubation & Mentorship: My background includes creating incubation toolkits that embed personal “why” exploration—informed by my master’s research on post-traumatic growth—while tracking tangible outcomes.\nFollow-On Funding Collaboration: Although my primary strength is in incubation and capacity building, I have worked with UNICEF networks and other development partners to map funders’ interests, maintain updated team profiles, and facilitate investor connections.\nParticipant-Centered Engagement: I believe in amplifying youth agency. Throughout the year, I plan on co-creating sessions—including storytelling workshops, capacity-building events, and knowledge product development. Where applicable, we can incorporate ethical AI training or green entrepreneurship modules.\nProposed Scope & Approach\nEarly Discovery & Mapping: Start with a clear overview of GenU’s existing entrepreneurship initiatives and any local frameworks in Egypt or elsewhere.\nIntegrated Support System: Combine best practices from Bloom.pm and GenU’s own program elements—ensuring consistent data collection, mentorship flow, and incentive structures for ongoing participation.\nPortfolio Management & Egypt CO Alignment: Strengthen portfolio tracking and feedback loops while aligning local approaches with imaGen Ventures and ROTA/Silatech.\nCo-Created Incubation & Funding: Develop an Incubation Toolkit with personalized resilience prompts, plus a Follow-On Funding Strategy that includes mapping potential partners and orchestrating “touch points” (like pitch sessions or online investor meetings).\nKnowledge Products & Capacity Building: Produce case studies and technical proposals that reflect real youth stories and conduct bilingual (Arabic/English) workshops, ensuring inclusive adoption.\nMy daily rate is $400, with a total of 90 days planned ($36,000). I’m available to begin on January 10, 2025, and I’m confident this timeline allows us to satisfy all major deliverables (mapping, operational plan, portfolio strategy, Egypt model, knowledge products, etc.) as outlined in the Terms of Reference.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I would be excited to help empower young innovators across the GenU network, blending practical deliverables with youth agency to ensure long-term, scalable impact.\n\nSincerely,\nBilal Saad Ghalib\nbilal@bloom.pm | +1 (478) 227-2253\n\n"
