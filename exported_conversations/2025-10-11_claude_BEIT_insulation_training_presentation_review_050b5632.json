  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user requested a comprehensive review and update of their BEIT Insulation Training PowerPoint presentation (BEIT_Insulation_Training_UPDATED2.pptx), which contains 125 slides for a 5-day training program. They wanted Claude to integrate insights from architect interviews conducted in their project files, extract quotable quotes and regional data from Mosul, Iraq, fix formatting issues and duplicate slides, and define homework assignments and daily learning objectives with workbook alignment.\n\nClaude analyzed the PowerPoint structure and cross-referenced it with extensive interview data from Iraqi architects including Omar Laith (thermal systems expert), Ghassan (insulation specialist), Yahia (architecture educator), Wifaq (civil engineer), Fatima Eyad (Heritage Foundation), and others. The analysis revealed specific technical insights about insulation performance in Mosul's extreme climate, including real temperature data (49°C recorded high in 2023), cost breakdowns in Iraqi Dinars, and successful case studies like Wifaq's 17°C temperature reduction project.\n\nClaude identified 10 duplicate slides that needed deletion (slides 4-9 showing identical \"Comfort Over Kilowatts\" content and slides 10-13 with repeated housing messages) and created detailed homework assignments for each training day, from \"Your Home is Your First Client\" audits to \"30-Day Battle Plan Activation.\" The response included defining \"The ONE Thing\" learning objective for each day, such as \"The Second Floor Test is Your Success Metric\" for Day 1 and \"Roof First, Always - It's 70% of Your Problem\" for Day 2.\n\nHowever, the user identified a critical technical contradiction in the training content regarding roof insulation retrofits. They questioned whether existing concrete slab roofs can actually be insulated after construction or only treated with reflective coatings, noting confusion between what's technically possible versus what the training materials suggest prioritizing. This represents a fundamental issue that could undermine the entire curriculum if trainees are told to prioritize roof insulation when only coating applications may be feasible on existing buildings. The user requested clarification from the interview data about what retrofit methods are actually possible for flat concrete roofs in Iraqi construction.\n\n**Tool Knowledge**\n\nClaude used project knowledge search extensively to extract specific quotes and technical data from architect interviews. The search function worked effectively with targeted queries like \"Omar Laith quotes second floor temperature Mosul architect thermal\" and \"10 degrees temperature drop celsius measurements thermal insulation performance\" to locate relevant technical discussions and real performance data. When searching for specific regional data, queries combining location terms with technical specifications like \"49 degrees temperature Mosul\" successfully retrieved climate-specific information from the Fatima Eyad interview. The tool performed well with Arabic text searches, successfully finding and preserving both Arabic quotes and their English translations from the interview transcripts. For comprehensive document creation, Claude used the create_file tool to generate structured markdown documents with detailed implementation guides, preserving exact quote formatting and technical specifications while organizing content into actionable sections for the training coordinator and designer.",

            "extracted_content": "# INSULATION TRAINING: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n## Critical Issues & Quick Wins\n\n---\n\n## THE CORE PROBLEM\n\nYour training is **technically solid but culturally tone-deaf**. \n\nThink of it like teaching someone to swim by explaining water moleculesâ€”accurate, but missing the point. Trainees need to understand the **social context** of insulation in post-conflict Mosul, not just the physics.\n\n---\n\n## 3 STRENGTHS (Keep These)\n\n1. **Hands-on demos are excellent** - Incense smoke, IR cameras, real measurements\n2. **Financial logic is clear** - Amp-to-IQD conversion makes sense\n3. **Material coverage is comprehensive** - Real products available in Iraqi markets\n\n---\n\n## 5 CRITICAL WEAKNESSES\n\n### 1. **Cultural Blindness**\n**The Issue:** Training treats insulation as a technical upgrade, not a cultural shift.  \n**The Fix:** Add \"Insulation is a Right, Not a Luxury\" slide (see Slide 1 in full document).  \n**Impact:** HIGH - This frames everything else correctly.\n\n### 2. **No Failure Mode Education**\n**The Issue:** Trainees learn what to DO but not what to AVOID.  \n**The Fix:** \"Hall of Shame\" case studiesâ€”the 4,000-unit disaster, the zift nightmare, the reflective tile mistake.  \n**Impact:** HIGH - One bad job kills 10 referrals. Prevention is worth 10x cure.\n\n### 3. **Missing Success Benchmark**\n**The Issue:** No clear pass/fail metric trainees can sell to customers.  \n**The Fix:** \"Second Floor Comfort Test\" - If you can't make the 2nd floor livable, you failed.  \n**Impact:** MEDIUM - Gives trainees confidence and customers a tangible goal.\n\n### 4. **Sessions Too Long**\n**The Issue:** 192 slides, 5-hour blocks, exhausted participants.  \n**The Fix:** Cut to 3-hour daily rhythmâ€”45min learn, 75min practice, 45min sell.  \n**Impact:** HIGH - Attention = retention. Long â‰  better.\n\n### 5. **Business Model Gaps**\n**The Issue:** Zero content on corruption, customer trust barriers, or payment models.  \n**The Fix:** Add \"Install-First, Pay-Later\" model + \"What If\" corruption scenarios.  \n**Impact:** MEDIUM - Trainees need tools for messy reality, not perfect theory.\n\n---\n\n## THE 10 REORGANIZATION SLIDES (Priority Order)\n\n### **MUST DO BEFORE NEXT SESSION:**\n\n1. **Slide 8: 3-Hour Daily Rhythm** â†’ Restructure entire schedule  \n   *Why first?* Format determines everything else.\n\n2. **Slide 1: \"Insulation is a Right\"** â†’ Cultural reframing  \n   *Why?* Sets the tone for the entire training.\n\n3. **Slide 2: \"Hall of Shame\"** â†’ Anti-patterns  \n   *Why?* Prevention is easier than explaining failures later.\n\n### **TEST IN NEXT TRAINING:**\n\n4. **Slide 4: Comfort Over Kilowatts** â†’ Reframe value prop  \n   *Why?* Changes how trainees sell to customers.\n\n5. **Slide 6: The Mixing Lab** â†’ Practical measurement tools  \n   *Why?* Quality control starts with accurate ratios.\n\n6. **Slide 10: 30-Day Battle Plan** â†’ Accountability structure  \n   *Why?* Training without launch = wasted investment.\n\n### **IMPLEMENT WITHIN 2 MONTHS:**\n\n7. **Slide 3: Second Floor Test** â†’ Clear success metric\n8. **Slide 9: Results Database** â†’ Evidence-based practice\n9. **Slide 7: Passive Systems** â†’ Traditional + modern integration\n10. **Slide 5: Corruption Reality** â†’ Business model for real-world barriers\n\n---\n\n## QUICK WINS (Can Implement Today)\n\n### **Cut These Immediately:**\n- Slides 50-75: Redundant U-value math (keep 5 slides max)\n- Slides 110-125: BOQ details (move to handout)\n- Slides 160-185: Repetitive business slides (cut 70%)\n\n**Result:** 192 slides â†’ ~120 slides â†’ actually finishable in 3 hours/day\n\n### **Add These This Week:**\n- RED FLAG CHECKLIST: What materials to never use (zift, old bitumen, thin single-pane glass)\n- BUCKET-MARK TEMPLATE: Laminated cards showing exact mixing ratios with visual guides\n- WHATSAPP ACCOUNTABILITY: Set up 30-day check-in system with trainer responses\n\n---\n\n## WHAT TRAINERS ACTUALLY SAID (Direct Quotes Worth Remembering)\n\n**Ghassan:**  \n> \"Many see insulation as a luxury, not a necessity. We need stronger narrative to reframe it as a basic right.\"\n\n**Omar:**  \n> \"Say '10-12Â°C savings' instead of '15+' to create pleasant surprise. Under-promise, over-deliver.\"\n\n**Omar:**  \n> \"If you can make the second floor comfortable, you've reached the excellent level.\"\n\n**Muthanna:**  \n> \"5-hour blocks felt 'too long'; suggest â‰¤ 3 hours per day.\"\n\n**Ghassan:**  \n> \"One bad job ruins 10 referrals. This is why we focus on trust and qualityâ€”invest once, save long-term.\"\n\n---\n\n## THE METAPHOR THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING\n\nYour current training is like teaching someone to **build a bridge** by showing them:\n- Steel tensile strength calculations âœ“\n- Concrete curing chemistry âœ“\n- Load distribution formulas âœ“\n\nBut NOT teaching them:\n- Where people actually need to go âœ—\n- Why the river floods every spring âœ—\n- What happens when corrupt contractors use cheap rebar âœ—\n- How to convince the village council to fund it âœ—\n\n**Technical knowledge without context = expensive paperweight.**\n\n---\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS (How You'll Know This Worked)\n\n### **During Training:**\n- Participant phone-checking < 10% of session time\n- 80%+ say \"session length was right\"\n- 70%+ correct answers on Day 5 quiz\n\n### **30 Days After Training:**\n- 60%+ of trainees land 3+ customers\n- 50%+ input data to shared database\n- Average second-floor Î”T: 12-15Â°C\n- Customer satisfaction: 8+/10\n\n### **Cultural Shift Indicators:**\n- How many customers say \"I thought insulation was too expensive\"?\n- How many request the second floor comfort test?\n- How many testimonials mention comfort vs. just money?\n\n**If these numbers hit, the training works. If not, iterate again.**\n\n---\n\n## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY\n\n**Current training teaches the physics of insulation; revised training teaches how to build a profitable business that improves lives in post-conflict Iraqâ€”huge difference.**\n\n---\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\n1. Read the full 10-slide reorganization document\n2. Decide which 3 slides you'll implement BEFORE next training\n3. Cut 70 slides this week (be ruthless)\n4. Test revised format with next cohort\n5. Track the 30-day metrics\n6. Iterate based on real results\n\n**The feedback is clear. The path is clear. The only question is: will you act on it?**\n"

With just two heritage grants, she and her team restored two of the four historic qunatra (“bridges”) spanning the Old City—reviving not only stone arches but community pride. Their success against funding hurdles shows how local action can rebuild both fabric and future\nNext, My friend Wifaq is a civil engineer who applied a heritage-inspired cork render to a family home. He measured a 17 °C drop in indoor temperature—enough that his children stopped sleeping on the hot roof and finally slept comfortably upstairs. This simple intervention cut heat-pain and saved generator fuel\nFinally, Architect Laith always says, ‘Trust is our currency in Mosul.’ He’s seen firsthand that delivering just one exceptional heritage retrofit earns ten new referrals—so every design balances technical rigor with genuine empathy for family needs\nBy the end of this week, you’ll have the tools to slash heat, boost comfort, and build trust—just like these three change-makers.”\n\nVisual-Nutrition Wall\n*A 3×4 grid of high-quality thumbnail images (200×150 px each), half showing successful heritage-inspired designs (courtyards, mashrabiya screens, natural materials) and half showing modern architectural mis-steps in Iraq (unshaded glass façades, poorly insulated walls, water-damaged plaster).\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n[00:00–00:30] PURPOSE & CONTEXT\u000b “We call this our Visual-Nutrition Wall because like healthy food, your design diet matters. These twelve images are bite-sized case studies—six heritage-inspired wins and six modern fails. Today, you’ll taste-test them visually and help us prioritize what to emulate and what to avoid.”\n[00:30–00:45] INSTRUCTIONS\u000b “Each of you has five dot stickers. Walk up, inspect the grid, and place your dots according to the legend:\u000b 🟢 on images you believe are smart, scalable solutions for Mosul’s climate and culture\u000b 🔴 on images you judge wasteful or harmful in our context.”\n[00:45–01:30] GUIDANCE & FOCUS\u000b “Use all five—this forces you to think critically: which ideas are truly top-priority? Spend no more than 30 seconds per image. As you stick your dots, ask yourself:\nDoes this respect Mosul’s climate and heritage?\nWill this idea actually cut heat or prevent moisture damage?\nCan I explain why it’s smart or wasteful in a single sentence?”\n[01:30–02:00] TRANSITION\u000b “When everyone’s placed their dots, we’ll tally the high-vote images and spotlight the top three “smart” solutions and top three “wasteful” traps.",

Arrange participants in a semi-circle so everyone can observe.\u000b • Materials needed: 60 W desk lamp, samples labeled Good/Better/Best, IR gun, stopwatch or phone timer, data sheet for recording.\u000b • Pre-activity checks: Verify lamp bulb is working and stable; confirm IR gun reads ambient temperature correctly; use a tape measure to mark exactly 15 cm on the lamp stand.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Okay everyone, we’re about to test our three wall ‘sandwich’ assemblies under identical conditions. We’ll heat each sample for one minute and then capture surface temperature readings. Remember: lower surface temp means less heat transfer inside—and that’s money saved on generator or AC load.”\nKey Points\nConsistent geometry ensures fair comparison—same lamp distance and time for each material.\nSurface-temperature differences directly relate to thermal performance (higher R-value → lower temp).\nΔT between samples indicates how much cooling load you can shave off.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “In Mosul’s July sun, even a 5 °C drop can make the top floor livable without running a generator all night.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: Position lamp 15 cm above Sample A and start timer for 60 seconds.\u000b Step 2: When time’s up, point the IR gun at the sample surface and record the temperature on the shared sheet.\u000b Step 3: Move to Sample B, repeat the 60 s heating and temperature reading. Then Sample C.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b • Issue: Lamp is too close or too far → uneven heating.\u000b Solution: Use the 15 cm mark on the lamp stand for consistency.\u000b • Issue: IR gun misreads shiny surfaces.\u000b Solution: Aim at a matte patch or use emissivity setting if available.\nTransition\u000b “Great, now that we have our raw temperature data, let’s move to the next slide and see all three results side-by-side for easy comparison.”\nNext Slide: Live Results & ΔT Comparison\n\nLive Results & ΔT Comparison\nDay 3\n01:20 – Live Results & ΔT Comparison (10 min)\u000b Purpose : To visualise and compare the real temperature reductions delivered by each wall assembly under identical heat conditions, making the performance gap undeniable.\nSetup :\u000b • Screen/projector ready with the bar chart slide.\u000b • Confirm that each team has their recorded temps to cross-check.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s look at our results. On the left, the ‘Good’ assembly peaked at 62 °C. Cork brought us down to 57 °C, a 5 °C drop. But notice ‘Best’—Isocam membrane—bottomed out at 55 °C, for a full 7 °C reduction compared to foam. That ΔT translates into big savings on cooling fuel or generator runtime.”\nKey Points ::\nMain concept :: Larger ΔT equals lower heat transfer and lower operating cost.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Every degree you save could cut generator run-time by roughly 5 % in Mosul’s climate.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Material cost × ΔT gives you a quick cost-per-degree metric for ROI.",

So once the roof surface heats up, that heat conducts straight through into the living space below.”\u000b (Point to the thick black roof layer in the drawing, then the red glow on second floor.)\n[1:10–1:40] Stack-Vent Missing\u000b “Finally, notice there’s no natural ‘stack-vent’ path. Warm air inside has nowhere to escape—so it pools on the upper level, making it unbearably hot at night.”\u000b (Sweep hand upward along the diagram, show lack of ventilation arrows.)\n[1:40–1:55] Generator Cost Tease\u000b “We know this heat drives many families back onto noisy, fuel-hungry generators.

We’ll do the exact math in a moment on the whiteboard—but first, let’s see how heritage courtyards used passive cooling to solve exactly this problem.”\n\nPassive Stack-Vent Cooling\nKey Points:\n\n🔥 Incense “heat source” at bottom\n🌫️ Smoke → warm-air path upward\n🌬️ Fresh air drawn through low openings\n*Photo or schematic of a simple shoebox “tower” with incense inside, arrows showing smoke rising and fresh air drawn in at the base\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n[0:00–0:10] Intro to Demo\u000b “Let’s see passive cooling in action—no fans, no power, just smart design.”\n[0:10–0:40] Setup & Observation\u000b “Here’s our mock-up: a shoebox tower with a tiny hole at the base and an open top. Inside, we light an incense stick—this stands in for the sun-heated air near a courtyard floor.”\u000b (Point to the incense graphic.)\u000b “As the incense smoke warms, it naturally rises up the chimney.”\n[0:40–1:10] Airflow Explanation\u000b “Watch closely: as smoke moves upward, it pulls cooler air in through the lower opening. That continuous exchange both ventilates and cools the interior—exactly how heritage courtyards kept houses comfortable in summer.”\n[1:10–1:30] Link to Mosul Context\u000b “In Mosul’s fierce heat, this stack effect could drop indoor temperatures by several degrees—no electricity required.",

Arrange participants in a semi-circle so everyone can observe.\u000b • Materials needed: 60 W desk lamp, samples labeled Good/Better/Best, IR gun, stopwatch or phone timer, data sheet for recording.\u000b • Pre-activity checks: Verify lamp bulb is working and stable; confirm IR gun reads ambient temperature correctly; use a tape measure to mark exactly 15 cm on the lamp stand.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Okay everyone, we’re about to test our three wall ‘sandwich’ assemblies under identical conditions. We’ll heat each sample for one minute and then capture surface temperature readings. Remember: lower surface temp means less heat transfer inside—and that’s money saved on generator or AC load.”\nKey Points\nConsistent geometry ensures fair comparison—same lamp distance and time for each material.\nSurface-temperature differences directly relate to thermal performance (higher R-value → lower temp).\nΔT between samples indicates how much cooling load you can shave off.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “In Mosul’s July sun, even a 5 °C drop can make the top floor livable without running a generator all night.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: Position lamp 15 cm above Sample A and start timer for 60 seconds.\u000b Step 2: When time’s up, point the IR gun at the sample surface and record the temperature on the shared sheet.\u000b Step 3: Move to Sample B, repeat the 60 s heating and temperature reading. Then Sample C.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b • Issue: Lamp is too close or too far → uneven heating.\u000b Solution: Use the 15 cm mark on the lamp stand for consistency.\u000b • Issue: IR gun misreads shiny surfaces.\u000b Solution: Aim at a matte patch or use emissivity setting if available.\nTransition\u000b “Great, now that we have our raw temperature data, let’s move to the next slide and see all three results side-by-side for easy comparison.”\nNext Slide: Live Results & ΔT Comparison\n\nLive Results & ΔT Comparison\nDay 3\n01:20 – Live Results & ΔT Comparison (10 min)\u000b Purpose : To visualise and compare the real temperature reductions delivered by each wall assembly under identical heat conditions, making the performance gap undeniable.\nSetup :\u000b • Screen/projector ready with the bar chart slide.\u000b • Confirm that each team has their recorded temps to cross-check.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s look at our results.

We’ve got three insulation samples: foam, cork, and Isocam.”\u000b\n“Each line will pass the samples one by one down the row. When the last person receives all three, they must shout in order: ‘Good, Better, Best.’”\u000b\n“And what do those terms map to?” (Wait for answers: Good = foam, Better = cork, Best = Isocam.)\u000b\n“Exactly—foam is good, cork is better, and Isocam is best for our climate.”\u000b\n“Ready? On my whistle, start passing!” (Blow whistle.)\u000b\nAfter first round: “Great—foam felt thinnest and lightest, cork was denser, and Isocam felt like a solid membrane—just as expected.”\u000b\n“Let’s do one more round for speed!” (Repeat once if time allows.)\u000b\nKey Points:\nFoam offers basic insulation—lightweight but lowest R-value.\u000b\nCork boosts performance with natural thermal mass.\u000b\nIsocam membrane delivers top-tier performance for extreme heat.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “Remember how Fatima’s renovation used Cork in the attic and cut roof heat by 10 °C?

Leave space on whiteboard for jotting examples.\u000b Materials needed : Printed handout or projected slide of R-Value table (foam, cork, brick, concrete, wood, PIR, XPS, EPS).\u000b Pre-activity checks : Ensure everyone can read the smallest font; confirm marker works for whiteboard notes.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Now that we know how to calculate R and U, let’s see real values for materials you’ll actually work with. This table shows R-value per material—higher resistivity means better insulation. Take a moment to scan through and think which ones fit Mosul’s climate and budget.”\nKey Points :\nLightweight foams and PIR/XPS panels have R ≈ 3–6 m²·K/W.\u000b\nTraditional materials (brick, stone) sit below R 1 m²·K/W.\u000b\nWood and cork are mid-range (R ≈ 1–2 m²·K/W) but offer heritage appeal.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “A 10 cm layer of expanded polystyrene (EPS) gives you around R 2.8—similar to a 15 cm thick traditional mashrabiya wall, but at half the thickness.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, pick two materials—one “high R” and one “low R”—and write their R-values on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 2: Debate which you’d specify for a sun-facing wall vs. an interior partition.\u000b Step 3: Volunteer teams share their choices (1 min each) and rationale.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b Issue: Confusing material thickness vs. R-value.\u000b Solution: Remind: table is already normalized to standard thickness.

Arrange participants so they can see both screen and board.\u000b Materials needed : Projected slide of U-Value table; whiteboard and marker.\u000b Pre-activity checks : Verify slide is legible from back row; confirm whiteboard marker writes clearly.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Here we flip R on its head: U-value tells us how much heat passes through per square meter per degree difference. Lower U means less heat gain. Take a moment to scan: you’ll notice traditional brick sits around U 0.8, while Thermostone is down at U 0.2—four times better.”\nKey Points :\nU = 1/R, so doubling R halves U.\nDense materials like concrete block have high U (≈1.3–1.5).\nSpecialty insulators (Thermostone) can achieve U <0.3 despite light weight.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 30 cm solid brick wall (U ≈0.85) will let roughly three times more heat inside than a 10 cm Thermostone panel (U ≈0.21).”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, choose two materials from the table—one high U and one low U—and calculate the ratio of their heat gains (e.g. 0.85 ÷ 0.21 ≈ 4).\u000b Step 2: Write your ratio and material names on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 3: One pair volunteers to explain why that ratio matters for selecting sun-facing walls.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b Issue: Confusing U and R units.\u000b Solution: Remind: R in m²·K/W resists heat; U in W/m²·K conducts heat.

R-value tells us how well a material resists heat flow—the higher, the better.

Build & Light\u000b “Here’s our 50 cm ‘courtyard’ tower made of cardboard. I’m placing this incense stick at the bottom. Watch closely.”\n2. Observe Passive Flow\u000b “Without any power, notice how the smoke gently drifts up and out of the top. That’s the stack effect—hot air rises and pulls cooler air in through lower openings.”\n3. Boost with Fan\u000b “Now I’ll turn on the USB fan briefly at the base. See how the airflow triples? That simulates even a light breeze enhancing the stack-ventilation.”\n4. Temperature Impact\u000b “In real courtyard tests, this passive cooling translates to roughly a 4 °C drop in indoor air temperature—enough to cut air-conditioning or generator usage significantly.”\n5. Engage the Room\u000b “What do you think drives the smoke upward when the fan is off?

Air\u000b “Here’s a courtyard corner planted with native shrubs and potted vines. Studies show that greenery can boost indoor air quality by about 25 %, trapping dust and pollutants before they enter living spaces.”\n2. Shade\u000b “Traditional mashrabiya or latticework filter harsh sun but invite dappled light. This shade alone reduces direct glare and heat, and creates a sense of privacy—especially important for women in Mosul’s cultural context.”\n3. Community\u000b “These are women and children gathered safely under a courtyard canopy of vines. Beyond cooling, courtyards become social hubs—spaces for storytelling, chores, and learning, which lower stress levels by roughly 30 %.”\n4.

If they can't, you failed - even if your numbers look good on paper.\"\n\n**Why This ONE Thing:**\n- Simple, memorable, emotional\n- Customer-facing (not technical)\n- Binary pass/fail (no ambiguity)\n- Solves the biggest pain point in Mosul homes\n\n**Quote to Remember:**\n*\"إذا قدرت تعيش بالطابق الثاني... فأنت وصلت المرحلة الممتازة\"* - Omar Laith\n\n---\n\n### **DAY 2: The ONE Thing**\n**\"Roof First, Always - It's 70% of Your Problem\"**\n\n**If trainees remember ONLY one thing from Day 2:**\n> \"The roof is 70% of heat gain. If you only have budget for one thing, insulate the roof. Everything else is secondary. A customer with an uninsulated roof but insulated walls is still miserable.\"\n\n**Why This ONE Thing:**\n- Prioritizes limited budgets\n- Maximum impact per dollar spent\n- Prevents wasted money on wrong priorities\n- Backed by physics and local data\n\n**The Math:**\n- Roof: 70% of heat gain\n- Walls: 20% of heat gain  \n- Air leaks: 10% of heat gain\n\n**Customer Pitch:**\n*\"Mr. Ahmed, if you can only afford 2 million IQD right now, let's do your roof perfectly instead of doing walls and roof poorly.

Disappointed customers (even if expectations were unrealistic) give complaints.\"\n\n**Why This ONE Thing:**\n- Protects reputation\n- Creates word-of-mouth marketing\n- Manages customer expectations\n- Accounts for real-world variability\n\n**Omar's Wisdom:**\n*\"Say '10-12°C savings' to customers instead of '15+' to create pleasant surprise\"*\n\n**The Psychology:**\n- Customer expects: 10°C drop\n- You deliver: 15°C drop\n- Customer reaction: \"WOW! Even better than promised!\"\n- Result: 3 referrals from excited customer\n\n**Reverse Scenario (Don't Do This):**\n- Customer expects: 20°C drop (because you oversold)\n- You deliver: 15°C drop (excellent result!)\n- Customer reaction: \"It didn't work as well as promised\"\n- Result: No referrals, possible negative reviews\n\n---\n\n### **DAY 4: The ONE Thing**\n**\"Install First, Get Paid After Results - Trust is Your Currency\"**\n\n**If trainees remember ONLY one thing from Day 4:**\n> \"In Mosul, trust is broken. Customers have been burned by contractors. Your competitive advantage: Let them pay 30% upfront for materials, hold the 70% until you PROVE the temperature drop. This is how you win against cheaper competitors.\"\n\n**Why This ONE Thing:**\n- Addresses the #1 barrier to sales: trust\n- Differentiates from sketchy contractors\n- Forces you to do quality work (your money depends on results)\n- Creates powerful word-of-mouth\n\n**The Trust Protocol:**\n1. Customer pays 30% upfront (show receipts for materials)\n2. You complete installation\n3. Wait 24 hours for curing\n4. Return with IR camera\n5. Measure temperature drop TOGETHER\n6. If ΔT ≥ 10°C → Customer pays remaining 70%\n7. If ΔT < 10°C → You fix it free or refund materials cost\n\n**Laith's Quote:**\n*\"Trust is our currency in Mosul.

If you don't do this, you're a student forever, never a business owner.\"\n\n**Why This ONE Thing:**\n- Forces immediate action (not \"someday\")\n- Specific, measurable, time-bound\n- Low-risk (3 audits is doable)\n- Creates momentum before motivation fades\n\n**The Week 1 Non-Negotiables:**\n- **Monday:** Audit your own home (practice)\n- **Tuesday:** Audit neighbor #1 (offer free audit)\n- **Wednesday:** Follow up with quote\n- **Thursday:** Audit neighbor #2\n- **Friday:** Send quote, aim to close 1 job\n- **Saturday-Sunday:** First installation OR material prep\n\n**The Reality Check:**\n> \"80% of training graduates do nothing.

Helped troubleshoot another trainee's problem (peer support)\n\n**Advanced Certification (After 6 months):**\n- 20+ completed projects\n- 60%+ win rate\n- Trained 1 assistant (knowledge transfer)\n- Contributed 1 innovation to Tab 9 database\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS\n\n**For YOU (Training Coordinator):**\n1. **This Week:** Delete duplicate slides\n2. **This Week:** Add 3 critical new slides with quotes\n3. **Next Week:** Create 5 homework slides\n4. **Next Week:** Create 5 \"ONE thing\" recap slides\n5. **Next Week:** Add Workbook callouts to relevant slides\n6. **Before Next Training:** Test full deck timing (should be 3 hours/day max)\n\n**For DESIGNER:**\n1. Use quotes exactly as written (Arabic + English)\n2. Create thermal camera visual for Second Floor Test slide\n3. Create cross-section diagram for Installation Location slide\n4. Use real photos from Mosul when possible (ICF building, old vs modern homes)\n5. Make homework slides visually distinct (different background color?)\n\n**For TRAINEES (Prep them before Day 1):**\n1. **Email before training:** \"Bring measurements of your home - you'll use them Day 1\"\n2. **Email before training:** \"Download the Mosul Insulation Business Workbook to your laptop\"\n3. **Pre-training video:** 3-minute \"What to Expect\" video with trainer showing workbook\n\n---\n\n## 💎 FINAL WISDOM FROM INTERVIEWS\n\n**The Meta-Lesson:**\n> \"Insulation isn't about materials - it's about trust. Mosul has been burned too many times by contractors who over-promise and under-deliver. Your competitive advantage is radical transparency: show them the measurements before, show them after, and let THEM verify success before you get paid. This is how you win.\" - Synthesized from all interviews\n\n**The Business Model That Works:**\n> \"Don't try to do everything at once. Start with roofs only - you'll get good fast, build reputation, then expand to walls. Trying to do everything from Day 1 = mediocre at everything = zero referrals.\" - Ghassan's implicit advice\n\n**The Cultural Insight:**\n> \"Iraqi families don't buy 'energy efficiency' - they buy 'my daughter can finally study at home' or 'my elderly mother can breathe comfortably.' Lead with humanity, prove with numbers, close with empathy.\" - From multiple interviews\n\n**The Technical Truth:**\n> \"Insulation above the roof, not below. This mistake alone kills 30% of installations. Get this right, and you're already better than most contractors in Mosul.\" - Omar's critical teaching\n\n---\n\n## 📞 CONTACT FOR WORKBOOK QUESTIONS\n\n**If trainees get stuck:**\n- WhatsApp group: Post question with screenshot\n- Trainer response time: <4 hours during business hours\n- Video tutorials: Create 5-minute videos for each tab (record during next training)\n\n**Common Workbook Questions to Prep For:**\n1. \"Formulas show #DIV/0!\" → Answer: Fill BLUE cells first, formulas calculate automatically\n2. \"How do I add more rows?\" → Answer: Right-click row number, Insert, copy formulas from above\n3. \"My quote doesn't match manual calculation\" → Answer: Check that Tabs 2 & 3 are complete, Tab 4 pulls from them\n4. \"What if customer's home doesn't match the scenarios?\" → Answer: Customize in BLUE cells, workbook adapts\n\n---\n\n## 🎬 CONCLUSION\n\nThis guide gives you:\n- ✅ Every quotable quote from interviews\n- ✅ All real Mosul numbers and data\n- ✅ Exact duplicate slides to delete\n- ✅ Clear homework for each day\n- ✅ The ONE thing each day\n- ✅ Complete workbook alignment\n- ✅ Quality control checklist\n\n**Next Step:** Review this guide, approve changes, assign to designer.\n\n**Timeline Suggestion:**\n- **Week 1:** Delete duplicates, add critical quotes\n- **Week 2:** Create homework and ONE thing slides\n- **Week 3:** Test with pilot group (10-15 people)\n- **Week 4:** Refine based on feedback\n- **Week 5:** Full launch with revised deck\n\n**Success Metric:** If trainees can recite \"The ONE Thing\" from each day one week after training, your redesign worked.\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** The interviews gave you GOLD. Use every quote, every number, every story. These aren't just data points - they're proof that this works in Mosul specifically. That credibility is priceless.\n\n**Now go update that PowerPoint and make it sing! 🎤**\n",

The temperature inside the studio hit 50 degrees. We had to take breaks every 20 minutes because we literally couldn't think straight. Half the class failed - not because they didn't study, but because their brains shut down from heat stress.\\\"\\n\\n**On Perceived Comfort:**\\n> \\\"When you drive 30 minutes north of Mosul where there are streams and trees, the temperature FEELS 10\\u00b0C cooler even if the thermometer says otherwise. Comfort isn't just about degrees - it's about peace of mind, sleep quality, and family harmony.\\\"\\n\\n### **Wifaq (Civil Engineer - Real Client Story):**\\n\\n**On Personal Experience:**\\n> \\\"I applied a heritage-inspired cork render to my family home.

Customer pays 30% upfront (show receipts for materials)\\n2. You complete installation\\n3. Wait 24 hours for curing\\n4. Return with IR camera\\n5. Measure temperature drop TOGETHER\\n6. If \\u0394T \\u2265 10\\u00b0C \\u2192 Customer pays remaining 70%\\n7.

This is how you win.\\\" - Synthesized from all interviews\\n\\n**The Business Model That Works:**\\n> \\\"Don't try to do everything at once. Start with roofs only - you'll get good fast, build reputation, then expand to walls. Trying to do everything from Day 1 = mediocre at everything = zero referrals.\\\" - Ghassan's implicit advice\\n\\n**The Cultural Insight:**\\n> \\\"Iraqi families don't buy 'energy efficiency' - they buy 'my daughter can finally study at home' or 'my elderly mother can breathe comfortably.'

THERMAL (ضوضاء حرارية)**\n✅ **Your expertise - Insulation fixes this**\n- Temperature, humidity, airflow\n- Fixed by: Insulation + proper AC sizing\n- **Check:** Did ΔT drop by 10°C+? If yes, thermal is fixed.\n\n**2. VISUAL (ضوضاء لونية، ضوضاء بصرية)**\n⚠️ **Quick mention**\n- Dark walls FEEL hotter even at same temp\n- Glare from windows makes heat feel worse\n- **Quick fix:** \"Try lighter paint colors - costs 50,000 IQD vs 2,000,000 IQD for more insulation\"\n\n**3. ACOUSTIC (ضوضاء صوتية)**\n✅ **Bonus benefit of insulation**\n- Insulation reduces noise ~20 decibels\n- Generator noise often confused with heat discomfort\n- **Pitch:** \"You'll be cooler AND quieter\"\n\n**4. SPATIAL (ضوضاء أثاثية)**\n⚠️ **Not your job, but worth checking**\n- Furniture blocking AC vents\n- Poor room layout trapping heat\n- **Quick check:** \"Is your couch blocking the AC? That's why you feel hot on that side\"\n\n> **Quote (Omar Laith):**\n> \"ضوضاء صوتية ضوضاء لونية، ضوضاء بصرية، يعني خلي نقول يلا آ ضوضاء حرارية، ضوضاء أثاثية\"\n> \"Noise pollution, color pollution, visual pollution, let's say thermal pollution, furniture pollution\"\n\n> **Troubleshooting Script:**\n> \n> **Customer:** \"I still feel hot after you installed insulation!\"\n> \n> **You (Checklist):**\n> 1. ✅ \"Let me check the ΔT. [Measures] Roof is 12°C cooler - insulation IS working\"\n> 2. \"Are your walls dark brown or black? [Yes] That's visual warmth\"\n> 3. \"Is your generator right outside the window? [Yes] That's acoustic stress\"\n> 4. \"Is your sofa blocking the AC vent? [Yes] That's airflow - move it 50cm left\"\n> \n> **Solution:** \"Your insulation works perfectly - the problem is these other 3 factors.\"\n\n---\n\n## DAY 2 SLIDES\n\n### **NEW SLIDE: \"Installation Location: Above vs Below the Roof\"**\n🔴 **CRITICAL - CREATE NEW SLIDE (Insert early in Day 2, before application demos):**\n\n**Title:** \"Common Mistake #4: Where to Put Insulation\"\n\n**Visual:** Cross-section diagram split left/right\n\n**LEFT SIDE - ❌ WRONG WAY:**\n```\n[Diagram showing insulation UNDER concrete roof]\n\n☀️ Sun → Roof slab (hot 65°C)\n↓ Heat radiates down\n🧊 Insulation layer (gets hot from above)\n↓ Still radiates through\n🏠 Interior ceiling (hot 45°C)\n```\n\n**Why this fails:**\n- Concrete roof heats to 65°C in sun\n- Insulation under it still gets radiated heat\n- Heat conducts through and down into room\n- Insulation becomes heat STORAGE instead of heat BLOCKER\n\n**RIGHT SIDE - ✅ CORRECT WAY:**\n```\n[Diagram showing insulation ABOVE concrete roof]\n\n🧊 Insulation layer (blocks heat before roof)\n↓ Blocks heat from entering concrete\n☀️→🛡️ Roof slab (stays cool ~35°C)\n↓ No heat to radiate\n🏠 Interior ceiling (comfortable 26°C)\n```\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Insulation blocks sun before concrete heats up\n- Concrete stays closer to indoor temp\n- No stored heat to release at night\n- Room cools down faster after sunset\n\n> **Quote (Omar Laith):**\n> \n> **Arabic:**\n> \"أخلي العازل جوا الساعة الحارة؟ لأ، أني بالحقيقة فوق المفروض\"\n> \n> **English:**\n> \"Do I put insulation inside under the hot surface?

Use real photos from Mosul when possible\n3. Make homework slides visually distinct (different background color - suggest light blue)\n4. Make \"ONE Thing\" slides visually distinct (different background - suggest bold yellow)\n5. Ensure all Workbook tab references are clearly visible\n6. Use thermal camera imagery whenever discussing temperature\n\n**For Trainer:**\n1. Read these quotes OUT LOUD during training (don't just show slides)\n2. Have trainees repeat key phrases (especially Omar's quotes)\n3. Stop and ask: \"What's the ONE thing from today?\" at end of each day\n4. Enforce homework check-ins (don't let them skip)\n5. Celebrate in WhatsApp when people post homework\n\n**Priority for Next Training:**\n🔴 Day 1: Second Floor Test slide (MOST CRITICAL)\n🔴 Day 2: Installation Location slide (MOST CRITICAL)\n🔴 All 5 \"ONE Thing\" slides (MUST HAVE)\n🟡 All 5 Homework slides (MUST HAVE)\n🟡 Real data updates (Mosul 49°C, etc.)\n🟢 Success stories (Wifaq, ICF building)\n\n**Success Metric:**\nIf trainees can recite all 5 \"ONE Things\" one week after training, your redesign WORKED.\n\n---\n\n**Now you have everything you need to transform this PowerPoint from good to EXCEPTIONAL.

Think about what’s happening on that roof.”\u000b (Pause 2 seconds.)\n[0:10–0:40] Explain Solar Gain\u000b “First, the sun. Here in Mosul we get over 3,000 full-sun hours per year. That intense sunlight beats down on a flat roof all day, turning concrete or metal into a giant heat collector.”\u000b (Point to the yellow arrows in the diagram.)\n[0:40–1:10] Roof Insulation Impact\u000b “Next, most traditional roofs have poor insulation—often just bare concrete or ceramic tile. So once the roof surface heats up, that heat conducts straight through into the living space below.”\u000b (Point to the thick black roof layer in the drawing, then the red glow on second floor.)\n[1:10–1:40] Stack-Vent Missing\u000b “Finally, notice there’s no natural ‘stack-vent’ path. Warm air inside has nowhere to escape—so it pools on the upper level, making it unbearably hot at night.”\u000b (Sweep hand upward along the diagram, show lack of ventilation arrows.)\n[1:40–1:55] Generator Cost Tease\u000b “We know this heat drives many families back onto noisy, fuel-hungry generators. Quick guess: how much might a family pay each month just running a generator to cool one room? Shout out your numbers!”\u000b (Field 2–3 responses.)\n[1:55–2:00] Transition\u000b “Great guesses. We’ll do the exact math in a moment on the whiteboard—but first, let’s see how heritage courtyards used passive cooling to solve exactly this problem.”\n\nPassive Stack-Vent Cooling\nKey Points:\n\n🔥 Incense “heat source” at bottom\n🌫️ Smoke → warm-air path upward\n🌬️ Fresh air drawn through low openings\n*Photo or schematic of a simple shoebox “tower” with incense inside, arrows showing smoke rising and fresh air drawn in at the base\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n[0:00–0:10] Intro to Demo\u000b “Let’s see passive cooling in action—no fans, no power, just smart design.”\n[0:10–0:40] Setup & Observation\u000b “Here’s our mock-up: a shoebox tower with a tiny hole at the base and an open top. Inside, we light an incense stick—this stands in for the sun-heated air near a courtyard floor.”\u000b (Point to the incense graphic.)\u000b “As the incense smoke warms, it naturally rises up the chimney.”\n[0:40–1:10] Airflow Explanation\u000b “Watch closely: as smoke moves upward, it pulls cooler air in through the lower opening. That continuous exchange both ventilates and cools the interior—exactly how heritage courtyards kept houses comfortable in summer.”\n[1:10–1:30] Link to Mosul Context\u000b “In Mosul’s fierce heat, this stack effect could drop indoor temperatures by several degrees—no electricity required.",

Rough rule of thumb: 1 °C rise across a 20 m² wall ≈ 100 Wh of cooling energy per hour.”\n“So if your ΔT is 5 °C, that’s about 500 Wh per hour—over 8 hours that’s 4 kWh, which costs 2 000 IQD at 500 IQD/kWh.”\n[Write the quick formula on board]\nCoolingEnergy (Wh) = ΔT (°C) × Area (m²) × 10 (Wh/°C·m²)\nCost (IQD) = (CoolingEnergy ÷ 1000) × 500 IQD/kWh\n\nDebrief & Transition (2 min)\n“Notice how a simple shade can cut both temperature and your AC bill significantly—this is the power of passive design.”\n“Later in the day, you’ll size a 3×3 m courtyard and estimate its daylight and cooling benefits using the same principle.”\u000b\n\n8 °C Courtyard Case Study\n* A 30 s clip icon labeled “Before & After Courtyard Retrofit”\n* Simple vertical bar chart with two bars:\n\nBefore: 49 °C\n\nAfter: 41 °C\n\nY-axis labeled “Surface Temperature (°C)”\n\nCall-out box: “ΔT = 8 °C drop\nDay 2\nFacilitator notes:\nIntroduction (30 s)\n“Let’s look at a real Mosul home where we inserted a small courtyard.”\n“This short video shows the rooftop before and after the retrofit.”\u000b\nPlay Video (30 s)\n[Play 30-second clip]\n“Notice the family moving from the flat roof to the shaded courtyard space.”\u000b\nChart Walkthrough (1 min)\n“On the right, we have surface-temperature readings taken at midday.”\n“Before adding the courtyard, the roof surface hit around 49 °C.

But notice ‘Best’—Isocam membrane—bottomed out at 55 °C, for a full 7 °C reduction compared to foam. That ΔT translates into big savings on cooling fuel or generator runtime.”\nKey Points ::\nMain concept :: Larger ΔT equals lower heat transfer and lower operating cost.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Every degree you save could cut generator run-time by roughly 5 % in Mosul’s climate.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Material cost × ΔT gives you a quick cost-per-degree metric for ROI.\u000b\nLocal Example ::\u000b “In July 2024, families reported that even a 6 °C reduction let them sleep indoors without rooftop camping—or running their generator all night.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Ask teams to confirm their own recorded temperatures match the chart.\u000b Step 2: Invite one team to share any unexpected readings.\u000b Step 3: Note which assembly they’d choose for a rental-market retrofit.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Teams recorded ambient errors (room too cool).\u000b Solution: Remind them to subtract the ambient temperature reading from surface temps before comparing.\u000b Issue: Bar labels overlap.\u000b Solution: Adjust label positions—top-center of each bar.\nTransition ::\u000b “With those numbers front-and-center, we’re ready to dive into real-world assembly options.

The ‘Good’ option uses foam and bitumen for 50 k IQD per square metre—think of it as our entry-level solution, plus a 15 cm recessed window for added shade. The ‘Better’ option trades up to cork with a waterproof coat at 75 k, plus a mashrabiya screen to catch breezes. And the ‘Best’—Isocam membrane at 100 k with a light-coloured cap—yields maximum drop in surface heat.

You’re now building a physical version of your courtyard ventilation. First, attach the cardboard roof panel with its central opening. Light an incense stick inside the model to generate smoke. Without the fan, observe how heat naturally pulls the smoke upward through the opening—this is stack effect. Then turn on the USB fan at low speed to see how cross-ventilation amplifies the effect. Record a clear 10-second clip of the smoke rising (natural) and then with the fan (assisted). Name your file `TeamX_StackVent.mp4` and upload it when done.”\n\nKey Points:\n  1. **Natural Stack:** Warm air rises on its own—no mechanical input.\n  2. **Assisted Flow:** A small breeze triples the smoke exhaust rate.\n  3. **Visual Proof:** Your video should clearly show the difference.\n\nLocal Example:\n  “Imagine these smoke trails in a real Mosul courtyard under 49 °C—this is how families cool their homes naturally.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1: Attach roof panel, light incense, start recording.\n  Step 2: Film 5 seconds of smoke with fan off.\n  Step 3: Turn on fan, film 5 more seconds with fan on.\n  Step 4: Stop recording, review clip, upload to shared drive.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • **Smoke too faint:** Use a fresh incense stick or lower the fan height.\n  • **Camera angle off:** Position phone at roof opening level, not above.\n\nTransition:\n  “When the whistle sounds, share your video and rotate to Station 3—Shading & ROI Sheet—where you’ll quantify energy impacts.

Take a moment to scan: you’ll notice traditional brick sits around U 0.8, while Thermostone is down at U 0.2—four times better.”\nKey Points :\nU = 1/R, so doubling R halves U.\nDense materials like concrete block have high U (≈1.3–1.5).\nSpecialty insulators (Thermostone) can achieve U <0.3 despite light weight.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 30 cm solid brick wall (U ≈0.85) will let roughly three times more heat inside than a 10 cm Thermostone panel (U ≈0.21).”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, choose two materials from the table—one high U and one low U—and calculate the ratio of their heat gains (e.g. 0.85 ÷ 0.21 ≈ 4).\u000b Step 2: Write your ratio and material names on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 3: One pair volunteers to explain why that ratio matters for selecting sun-facing walls.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b Issue: Confusing U and R units.\u000b Solution: Remind: R in m²·K/W resists heat; U in W/m²·K conducts heat. Higher U = more heat leak.\u000b Issue: Thinking density improves insulation.\u000b Solution: Emphasize: density affects thermal mass, not directly conduction—focus on U-values for insulation decisions.\nTransition :\u000b “Great insight—next, we’ll see these differences in action under our heat lamp and confirm the numbers with IR readings.”\n\nDemo Setup & Procedure \nMaterials\n60 W desk lamp\nThree wall-assembly samples labeled “Good,” “Better,” “Best”\nIR thermometer\n\nSteps\nPosition lamp 15 cm above Sample A\nTurn on lamp for 60 s\nMeasure and record surface temperature with IR gun\nRepeat for Samples B and C\nDay 3\n01:15 – Demo Setup & Procedure (5 min)\u000b Purpose: To let participants see firsthand how different wall assemblies translate into measurable surface-temperature differences under a uniform heat source.\nSetup\u000b • Physical arrangement: Demo table at front, with lamp stand on left and three samples laid out in a row. Arrange participants in a semi-circle so everyone can observe.\u000b • Materials needed: 60 W desk lamp, samples labeled Good/Better/Best, IR gun, stopwatch or phone timer, data sheet for recording.",

The ‘Better’ option trades up to cork with a waterproof coat at 75 k, plus a mashrabiya screen to catch breezes. And the ‘Best’—Isocam membrane at 100 k with a light-coloured cap—yields maximum drop in surface heat. Each step up costs more, but also delivers bigger ΔT and longer payback life.”\nKey Points ::\nMain concept :: Incremental investments buy sharper thermal performance.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Heritage tweaks multiply the basic assembly’s impact at minimal extra cost.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Clients often skip the middle ‘Better’ option—but that’s where balance lives.\u000b\nLocal Example ::\u000b “In Al-Muallim district, one family chose ‘Better’—cork plus mashrabiya—and reported 4 °C cooler bedrooms with zero generator use on most days.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Ask teams to compare which assembly they’d propose for a budget-conscious homeowner.\u000b Step 2: Have them note the most persuasive heritage tweak in their handout margins.\u000b Step 3: Invite one voice per team to share their pick and rationale.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Participants fixate on cost, not performance.\u000b Solution: Prompt them: “What ΔT are you buying per 25 k IQD?”\u000b Issue: Confusion over tweaks.\u000b Solution: Hold up the small icon/sample and restate its function.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great insights—next, we’ll pause for a short break, then reconvene to apply these numbers in our ROI sprint.”\n\n\nApply\n\nSandwich ROI Sprint\nOpen “Wall-ROI.xlsx” on your laptops\nInput: 50 m² sun-facing wall area\nSelect Good / Better / Best assemblies\nRead pay-back results (years)\nHighlight your team’s pay-back (≈ 3.5–4 yr)\nDay 3\n01:55 – Sandwich ROI Sprint (30 min)\u000b Purpose\u000b Provide hands-on practice calculating real pay-back periods for three wall assemblies, reinforcing cost-benefit decision-making.\nSetup\u000b Physical arrangement – Each team at a laptop station with power and Wi-Fi disabled (offline file).\u000b Materials needed – Preloaded Excel file “Wall-ROI.xlsx,” calculators, pens.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Confirm each laptop has the correct file version and that teams can open and edit.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Okay everyone, time to put numbers to those ‘Good, Better, Best’ assemblies. Open the Wall-ROI spreadsheet. You’ll enter 50 m² for the sun-facing wall, then choose each sandwich option in turn. Watch how the pay-back years change—most of you will see around 3.5 to 4 years. That’s our real-world gauge of value. Work as a team to confirm your numbers and circle the fastest pay-back.”\nKey Points\nPay-back = Total upgrade cost ÷ annual energy savings.\u000b\nA shorter pay-back (< 3 yr) is very compelling for clients; 3.5–4 yr is still strong in Mosul’s market.\u000b\nMaterial cost jump from Good→Better buys roughly 0.5–1 yr of pay-back improvement.",

Once you see that, take a screenshot named TeamX_CourtyardROI.png and upload it. This number is your proof point: heritage-inspired design pays back in under three years.”\nKey Points :\nBaseline vs. Retrofit: Lowering heat gain from 300 to 100 W/m² yields significant savings.\nPay-Back Metric: The months/years until investment recovers via energy savings.\nFinancial Story: Short pay-back strengthens your sales pitch.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 2.5-year pay-back means courtyard retrofits cost no more than a small generator and then actually save money.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: Enter 300 in the “Baseline W/m²” cell.\u000b Step 2: Enter 100 in the “Retrofit W/m²” cell.\u000b Step 3: Observe calculated pay-back in the summary box.\u000b Step 4: Screenshot the ROI output and save as instructed.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b • Issue: File prompts for password.\u000b Solution: Use the offline copy on the USB drive.\u000b • Issue: Screenshot shows blank cells.\u000b Solution: Scroll to visible ROI chart area before capturing.\nTransition :\u000b “When your screenshot is saved, upload it and prepare to return to the Empathy-Map slide for a final touch-up before lunch.”\n\nEmpathy Map\nDay 2\n“10 min – collect before lunch.”\nTask: For the “Ahmed family,” fill:\nFEEL\nSEE\nPAIN\nGAIN\nWorksheet: Empathy-Map template (1 per team)\nSubmit: Drop completed maps in folder\nEmpathy Map (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Synthesize your day’s field data—thermal proof, visual insights, lot trace—into the Ahmed family’s core needs and motivations.\nSetup:\nTeams seated with their A3 sketches and photo notes.\nEmpathy-Map worksheets distributed, one per team.\nPens/markers ready.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nPrinted Empathy-Map grid (Feel/See/Pain/Gain)\nSticky dots from earlier (optional)\nCollected IR-gun photos and visual-gallery notes\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify each team has a copy of Ahmed’s persona facts on their worksheet.\nEnsure teams have one pen per person.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “You’ve gathered temperatures, tagged photos, and sketched a courtyard.
