      "content": "If your baby has diarrhea, **nutritional yeast is generally not recommended**, especially if they are under 1 year old or if you're unsure how they’ll react to it. Here’s why:\n\n### Reasons to Be Cautious:\n1. **Gut sensitivity** – During diarrhea, your baby's digestive system is inflamed and more sensitive. Nutritional yeast, while healthy for some, can be **hard to digest** or trigger reactions in sensitive guts.\n2. **Histamine content** – Nutritional yeast can sometimes trigger histamine-like responses, leading to **rashes, irritability, or more GI upset** in sensitive individuals.\n3. **Unfamiliar foods** – Introducing a new or unfamiliar food during a bout of diarrhea is risky, as it’s harder to tell if the food is causing a reaction or if it's just the illness.\n\n### What to Do Instead:\nFocus on **easily digestible, binding, and familiar foods**:\n- **Breast milk or formula** (main fluid source)\n- **Bananas, rice, applesauce, toast** (BRAT diet)\n- **Plain yogurt** with live cultures (if dairy is normally tolerated)\n\nYou can consider **reintroducing nutritional yeast later**, when your baby is healthy and you’re monitoring for any reactions.\n\nLet me know your baby’s age and if they’ve had nutritional yeast before—I can give a more specific recommendation.",
