      "content": "I have a few hack projects and I'm wondering if any of them might be a good business. I have one i called txtray which allows people to email a document to a GPT and it will create a knowledg graph based on the content \nI have a project called cursiveGPT where you can use your ipad to write to chatGPT by handwriting and then selecting the text and asking GPT to talk back to you that way, it slows you down and makes your AI LLM use more purposeful. I have a prayer counting app that counts the numbers of prayers you're making up so you can catch up on your islamic missed prayers and keep track. I have a tool that uses the iphone 15's depth camera to make a color striations projection so you can use an iphone and a projector to make a world builder for kids with sand it will project on the sand so when you dig it'll be blue, on surface level it'll be green and on the top it'll be like a mountain brown and then white. The app just colorizes the different depths and offers sliders so you can set the distances. I have a project called parliaments.ai which allows you to create a series of LLMs each with a different mindset and a context for each agent so they can dialog and discuss based on your topic with and without your presence. \n\nWhich of these ideas might be easy to monetize and turn into a business ",
