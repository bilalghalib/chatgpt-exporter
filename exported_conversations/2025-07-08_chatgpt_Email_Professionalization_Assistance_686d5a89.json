I've CCed Nilam who can help find an appropriate time. If there is any information you can share in advance that could be helpful, I'd love to hear: number of expected concurrent users, location of server and location of customer base, potential sizes of db/data, how much you like/don't like amazon, etc - anything that could be helpful ;)\n+BG\n\nOn Tue, Jul 8, 2025 at 4:29 PM Margaret Smith-Peterson <m.smithpeterson@crsli.org> wrote:\nThank you, Noor! \nAnd thank you, Bilal, for being willing to lend some advice!

      "content": "Absolutely, Bilal. Here's a well-organized list of thoughtful and practical questions you can ask to guide the conversation, grouped by category. These will help uncover both technical and strategic needs before offering recommendations:\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 **General Context**\n- What’s the primary goal of the app? (e.g. internal tool, public-facing, data collection)\n- Is it already live or still under development?\n- What’s your current development stack (frontend/backend frameworks, database)?\n- How long do you expect to run this version of the app (prototype vs long-term)?\n- Will the app be used continuously or only during specific time periods (e.g., academic cycles)?\n\n---\n\n### 🌍 **User & Traffic Assumptions**\n- How many users do you expect *concurrently* and *monthly*?\n- Where are your users located geographically?\n- Will usage be predictable or spiky (e.g., all users log in at the same time for a report)?\n- Will you need to scale quickly if adoption grows faster than expected?\n\n---\n\n### 🗃 **Data & Storage**\n- What kinds of data are you storing (user accounts, surveys, files, videos)?\n- What's your estimate of database size now vs in a year?\n- Will you need file storage (e.g., PDFs, media uploads)? If yes, how much and what types?\n- Is the data sensitive (PII, health/education data, etc)? What privacy or security standards apply (e.g. HIPAA, FERPA, GDPR)?\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 **Security & Compliance**\n- Do you have any compliance needs (e.g., SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)?\n- Do users log in? If so, what kind of authentication are you using or planning (email/password, SSO, OAuth)?\n- Will different users have different roles/permissions?\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ **Hosting & DevOps Preferences**\n- Do you want full control over infrastructure (e.g., bare metal, DigitalOcean) or prefer serverless / managed solutions?\n- How much DevOps capacity do you have on your team? (e.g., would you rather not manage infrastructure at all?)\n- Do you already have an AWS account/team setup, or would this be a fresh deployment?\n- Do you prefer using open-source tools or managed/proprietary services?\n\n---\n\n### 📦 **Third-Party Tools / Integrations**\n- Are you already using any platforms like Supabase, Firebase, Hasura, etc.?\n- Are there any systems the app needs to integrate with (LMS, CRM, reporting tools)?\n- Do you plan to send automated emails, SMS, or notifications?\n\n---\n\n### 💸 **Budget & Constraints**\n- Is there a hosting or infrastructure budget you're working within?\n- Do you need to minimize costs during prototyping and scale later?\n- Are grants or donor transparency/reporting requirements a consideration in hosting choices?\n\n---\n\n### 🛠 **Dev Workflow & Future Plans**\n- What’s your deployment setup like? (CI/CD, versioning, rollbacks?)\n- Do you anticipate needing staging/test environments?\n- Is this part of a larger suite of tools or a one-off product?\n- Are you planning to open-source or keep it private?\n\n---\n\n### 🤖 Bonus (Future-readiness / AI / Analytics)\n- Do you plan to use any AI or ML services down the line?\n- Will the app generate reports or dashboards?\n- Are analytics important (e.g., user behavior tracking)?\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to turn this into a fillable template or collaborative doc to send them ahead of the meeting?",

      "content": "Got it! Here's a **focused set of hosting-specific questions** with a **lightweight decision tree** that maps responses to common AWS and alternative hosting options. This will help you quickly guide them based on priorities like control, scalability, budget, and ease of use.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Hosting Decision Tree (Simplified)\n\n**1. Do you want to manage servers yourself or prefer serverless / managed infrastructure?**\n\n- **Prefer managed / minimal DevOps?**  \n  → **Use AWS Amplify**, **Supabase**, or **Vercel + AWS backend**\n\n- **Want control over servers / infrastructure?**  \n  → Proceed to Q2\n\n---\n\n**2. Will traffic be spiky or high-concurrency (e.g. 500+ users at once)?**\n\n- **Yes, dynamic scaling is critical**  \n  → **Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **Fargate (ECS)**, or **Lambda (serverless)**\n\n- **No, predictable traffic or internal tool**  \n  → **EC2** or **Lightsail** may be enough\n\n---\n\n**3. Is the app a monolith or microservices-based?**\n\n- **Monolith**  \n  → AWS **Elastic Beanstalk**, **EC2**, or **Lightsail**\n\n- **Microservices**  \n  → **ECS (Fargate)** or **EKS (Kubernetes)** if needed\n\n---\n\n**4. Do you need a Postgres/SQL database and authentication built-in?**\n\n- **Yes**  \n  → Consider **Supabase** or AWS **AppSync + Cognito + RDS**\n\n- **No / External tools preferred**  \n  → Use AWS RDS separately or bring your own stack\n\n---\n\n**5. Any special file storage, AI/ML, or compliance requirements?**\n\n- **Yes**  \n  → Use AWS for modular services (e.g., S3 for storage, Comprehend or Bedrock for AI, RDS with encryption + backups for compliance)\n\n- **No**  \n  → Cheaper, simpler options like **Supabase**, **Render**, or **Railway** might suffice\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Core Hosting-Focused Questions to Ask\n\n| **Category**        | **Question** |\n|---------------------|--------------|\n| **Scale & Traffic** | How many users will be on at the same time (peak concurrency)? |\n|                     | Will traffic be consistent, seasonal, or unpredictable? |\n| **DevOps Capacity** | Do you have someone comfortable with managing AWS services and configs? |\n|                     | Do you prefer a “just works” setup or are okay with managing infrastructure? |\n| **App Architecture**| Is this a single full-stack app, or do you have multiple services/microservices? |\n|                     | Does the backend expose APIs or handle background jobs? |\n| **Database**        | What kind of database do you need (Postgres, MySQL, NoSQL)? |\n|                     | Do you need real-time updates or just traditional queries? |\n| **Storage**         | Will you store user-generated files (e.g., PDFs, images)? How much? |\n| **Auth & Security** | Do you need built-in user auth (email, SSO, Google login)? |\n|                     | Are there any security or compliance standards you need to meet? |\n| **Deployment**      | Do you have CI/CD or want to just push from Git? |\n| **Budget**          | Is there a monthly hosting budget you’re trying to stay under? |\n|                     | Is this long-term infrastructure or a short-term MVP? |\n| **Platform Bias**   | Do you prefer or want to avoid AWS, for any ethical, legal, or pricing reasons? |\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Hosting Options Summary (Cheat Sheet)\n\n| **Use Case**                     | **Recommended Platform**     | **Notes** |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|\n| MVP / Startup no DevOps          | **Supabase**                  | Built-in DB, auth, real-time, cheap |\n| Static frontend + API backend    | **Vercel + AWS Lambda/API GW**| Modern JAMStack style |\n| Full-stack, scalable, simple     | **AWS Amplify**               | AWS-hosted, minimal config |\n| Full control, long-term app      | **AWS EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk** | Customizable, classic IaaS |\n| Microservices, auto-scaling      | **AWS Fargate (ECS)**         | No server mgmt, container-based |\n| Low-cost, all-in-one VPS         | **Lightsail / Digital Ocean** | Good for small internal tools |\n| Enterprise & compliance-heavy    | **AWS full stack (S3 + RDS + EC2/ECS)** | Best for growth and complexity |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like this turned into a visual flowchart or a short doc you can share with the team.",
