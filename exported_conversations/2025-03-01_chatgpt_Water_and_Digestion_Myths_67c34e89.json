      "content": "In the Maliki school of thought, the determination of menstrual purity (ṭahārah) follows specific guidelines regarding spotting after an initial period of dryness. Here’s how to assess whether you can fast:\n\n### **1. Observing Dryness or White Discharge**\n- If you observe **complete dryness** or a **white discharge**, this indicates the end of menstruation.\n- At this point, you should **perform ghusl** (ritual purification) and can resume fasting and prayer.\n\n### **2. Spotting After Initial Dryness**\n- **If spotting occurs after dryness but before 10 days have passed:**  \n  - The Maliki school considers any blood within **10 days** of the start of menstruation as part of the period.  \n  - This means that if spotting resumes within the 10-day limit, you are still in menstruation and should **delay fasting and prayer** until full purity is achieved.\n\n- **If spotting occurs after 10 full days have passed:**  \n  - In the Maliki school, any bleeding beyond **10 days** is considered **istihāda (irregular bleeding)**, not menstruation.  \n  - In this case, you are considered **pure** and should continue fasting and praying, even if spotting continues. You should **perform wudu before each prayer**.\n\n### **3. Using Pads and Spotting**\n- If you are **internally dry** but notice slight spotting only when wearing a pad, it is important to determine if this is **true menstrual blood** or just residual spotting.\n- If the spotting is **light brown, yellowish, or residual**, scholars in the Maliki school often **do not** consider it part of the menstrual cycle **if dryness was already observed.**\n- However, if the spotting is **fresh red blood**, it may indicate the continuation of the period (if still within 10 days).\n\n### **4. Practical Steps to Determine Purity**\n1. **Check for dryness internally** (not just on the pad) by using a white cloth or tissue.\n2. If **dryness or white discharge** is confirmed, **do ghusl** and resume fasting.\n3. If fresh blood appears again **within 10 days**, it is still menstruation, and fasting should be postponed.\n4. If spotting occurs **after 10 days**, treat it as istihāda: you must **fast, pray, and perform wudu before each prayer**.\n\n#### **Summary:**\n- If you saw dryness or a white discharge and then had light spotting *after 10 days*, you **must fast** and perform prayers.\n- If spotting occurs **within 10 days** of menstruation beginning, consider it part of the period and **wait** until full purity is established.\n- If unsure, check with a trusted Maliki scholar, but generally, **spotting after confirmed dryness does not nullify purity** unless it is fresh red blood within the 10-day period.\n\nWould you like references from Maliki fiqh books for further clarity?",
