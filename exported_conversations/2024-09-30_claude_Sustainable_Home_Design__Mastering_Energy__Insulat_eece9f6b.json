The peak demand for electricity has\nrecorded an increase of about 46% in recent years as the country tries to cope with the\nprolonged, extremely hot summers and is projected to further expand. The energy\nreliance on fossil fuels and the fall of hydro power generation intensified CO2 emissions\nby 194% between the last two decades.\n\nCarbon Emissions\nIraq’s power grid inefficiencies during peak summer months result in frequent power cuts, leading to reliance on costly\nneighborhood generators, costing up to $4 billion annually in 2018.\nTo meet future demand, measures include improving distribution networks, reducing losses, increasing capacity with mobile\ngenerators, utilizing captured gas, and boosting renewable energy sources to supply 24-hour power by 2030.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nResource Depletion\n○ The poor management of water resources, reduced volumes of water flowing into the\nTigris and Euphrates rivers from origin countries, increased population demand,\ninefficient water consumption in the oil and agriculture sectors, and conflicts, all\ncontribute to the water insecurity which threatens at least 7 million of the total Iraqi\npopulation.\n○ Comprising 98% of Iraq’s water supply, the Euphrates and Tigris rivers have lost 30% of\ntheir flow in reference to the 1980s and it is further projected to decline to 50% by 2030.\nThe 2020–2021 rainfall season was the second driest in the last 40 years, causing a\nreduction in water flow in Tigris and Euphrates by 29% and 73%, respectively.\n\nResource Depletion\nMoreover, this water reduction is increasingly damaging agriculture and its farmers, especially since around\n75% of the population in agricultural areas work in crop production, mainly wheat and barley.\n\nResource Depletion\nThe geological and environmental significance of Lake Sawa in Iraq’s natural landscape made it a popular tourist\nattraction for decades. However, the once-mesmerizing lake, thousands of years old, is now nothing more than\na wasteland.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nWaste Generation\n○ Iraq is expected to generate 31,000\ntons of solid waste along with\nconstruction waste each day by per\ncapita waste generation surpassing 1.4\nkg per day.\n○ Additionally, many illegal landfills for\ndumping of the waste including\nConstruction and Demolition (C&D)\nwaste reported.\n\nWaste Generation\n\nWaste Generation\nSolid Waste\n○ Solid waste is a comprehensive\nexpression which contains the\nundesirable or unusable solid\nmaterials obtained from industrial,\nresidential and commercial exercises\nin a particular zone.\n\nWaste Generation\nConstruction Waste\n○ Construction waste is a combination\nof extra materials produced through\nnew construction, repair, and\ndestruction of structures, bridges,\nroads, and entire further works linked\nto civil engineering.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nTraditional Construction Methods\n● Conventional construction in\nIraq is not meeting current\nenvironmental, economic, and\nsocial needs.\n● High consumption of energy and\nwater is a significant issue.\n● Environmental pollution is\ncaused by construction work and\nresource consumption.\n● Deterioration of the\nenvironment and resources is a\nresult of this approach.\nSustainable Alternatives\n● Sustainable construction in Iraq\ncan reduce resource, energy, and\nwater consumption.\n● Environmental preservation is a\nbenefit of sustainable\nconstruction.\n● Sustainable performance for all\nstakeholders is a goal.\n● Sustainable culture in the\nconstruction industry needs to\nbe promoted.\n● Rising energy prices make\nsustainable construction more\nimportant.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nEnvironmental pollution\n● Iraq’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels not only constrains its economic stability but also contributes to\nsubstantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With more than 80% of Iraq's electricity derived from fossil\nfuels, including oil and gas, this reliance contributes to environmental degradation and inefficient energy\nuse, which are not sustainable for the long-term development of infrastructure.\n● In 2021, the Iraq energy consumption per person was 1.3 toe/person. About 1030 kWh of electricity were\nused per person in 2021 in Iraq. The total energy usage increase by 12%–50 Mtoe in 2021.\n● About 77% of the total energy use in 2021 come from oil; the remaining 23% come from gas and 4% come\nfrom renewables.\n● By 2018, CO2 emissions had increased by 69% compared to 2009 levels.\n● Electricity and heat producers generate the highest levels of emissions, followed by the transport sector and\nhouseholds.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nEnvironmental pollution\n\nEnvironmental Impacts of Construction and Housing in Iraq\nIn 2018, a total of 85.9 Mt CO2 was emitted from the electricity and heat generation sectors. The oil sector is the\nsource of 73% of the emissions, while the natural gas sector accounts for the remainder.. Most of the air pollution is\ncaused by the leakage of industrial waste and traffic fumes\n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nWater Scarcities\n○ Water withdrawals in riparian\ncountries, particularly Turkey, Iran,\nand to a lesser extent Syria, are\nincreasing due to rising demand.\nAccording to the Iraqi Ministry of\nWater Resources, future projections\nunder climate change indicate\nworsening conditions for the Tigris\nand Euphrates rivers. Studies suggest\nthe Euphrates-Tigris discharge could\ndecline by 9.5% between 2040 and\n2069, with some estimates predicting\nup to a 73% reduction in the\nEuphrates River's annual flow.\n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\n○ The fact that Climate Changes Impact are causing droughts and increased\ndesertification is becoming quite evident in recent years in Iraq and Syria forming\nthe two limbs of what is known as the “Fertile Crescent”.\n○ A direct consequence of the increased aridity, which is strongly felt, is the occurrence\nof sandstorms. According to the United Nations report, it indicates that the Iraqi\nMinistry of Environment has recorded 122 dust storms and 283 dusty days in 2012\nand it estimates that this will increase to 300 dusty days per year in the next ten\nyears.\n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nBy the end of this century, the “Fertile Crescent” would lose its current shape and could disappear altogether.\nThe area shown in picture witnessed one of the most devastating droughts in decades in (2007-2008) which\nscientists have linked to Climate Changes. This severe drought hit most of Syria and northern Iraq during what is\nnormally the wettest time of the year.\n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nSea Level Rise (SLR)\n○ The increase in the sea level due to climate change is more likely to impact many\ncoastal areas and inundate low-lying regions. And the most concerning area is Basrah\nGovernorate with their seven districts.\n○ It’s located between two latitudes of (29.05 - 31.20) north and two longitude of (46.40\n- 48.40) east in the southeast of Iraq, bordered by Iran to the east and Kuwait and the\nArabian Gulf from the south and southeast and Missan province to the north and the\nprovinces of DhiQar and Muthanna from the west.\n\nSea Level Rise (SLR)\nSea Level Rise (SLR) above the Mean Sea Level (MSL) may cause a significant hazard to Basrahh’s\ncoastal areas because of its low-lying floodplains\n● 1 M sea level rise (as shown in blue color) is\nlikely to affect most of the eastern part of the\nIraqi coast.\n● The affected area under 1 M sea level rise\nwould be 944 km2 (5% of total Basrah’ area).\n\nRelationship between Housing and Climate Change\n● Displacement Due to Environmental Degradation: The depletion of the Tigris and Euphrates\nrivers is forcing rural populations to migrate to urban areas, straining housing infrastructure.\n● Impact of Sand and Dust Storms on Housing: Dust storms are damaging building materials,\nincreasing the need for housing repairs.\n● Energy Inefficiency in Traditional Housing: Modern housing methods lack energy efficiency,\nincreasing energy consumption for cooling.\n● Urban Heat and Cooling Demands: The need for cooling systems during hot summers has led to\nhigher energy demands, especially in inefficient housing.\n\nPart 2\nGreen Building Solutions\n\nIntroduction to Green Building\nGreen building is an innovative construction approach that centers on sustainable practices to\nminimize the environmental impact of a structure. It involves sustainable materials, efficient\nenergy systems, green roofs, and other eco-friendly features. Green practices are a growing trend\nin the construction industry, with more and more builders adopting them in buildings to reduce\ntheir carbon footprint.\nGreen building practices have evolved from traditional construction methods, with increased focus\non sustainability due to global environmental challenges.\n\nGreen Building Standards Around the World\n● LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design): The most widely recognized green\nbuilding certification globally, covering key areas like water efficiency, energy use, materials,\nand indoor environmental quality.\n● BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method): A British\nstandard for sustainability in construction, focusing on energy performance, waste\nmanagement, and health and well-being.\n● Green Globes: A flexible certification system often used in North America, focusing on energy,\nwater efficiency, and sustainable materials.\n● WELL Building Standard: A certification that focuses on enhancing human health through\ndesign features such as air quality, lighting, and ergonomics.\n\nDesigning a Green Home\nDesigning a green home focuses on creating a sustainable, energy-efficient, and healthy living environment\nthat minimizes environmental impact while enhancing comfort and well-being.\nEnergy-Efficient Design Strategies:\n● Passive Solar Design: Orienting the home to capture sunlight in the winter while blocking excessive heat in the\nsummer. This reduces the need for mechanical heating and cooling systems.\n● Insulation and Airtightness: High-quality insulation in walls, roofs, and floors, combined with airtight\nconstruction, helps reduce heat loss and energy consumption.\n● Energy-Efficient Windows: Double or triple-glazed windows with low-E coatings improve insulation and reduce\nheat transfer, enhancing energy efficiency.\n● Renewable Energy Integration: Green homes often feature solar panels, solar water heating systems, and even\nsmall-scale wind turbines to generate clean, renewable energy on-site.\n● Energy Recovery Ventilation: Energy recovery ventilators (ERVs) or heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) exchange\nstale indoor air with fresh outdoor air while minimizing energy loss.\n\nDesigning a Green Home\nIndoor Air Quality and Health\nEnsuring good indoor air quality is essential for a healthy living environment. Green homes\nprioritize IAQ through:\n● Low-VOC and Non-Toxic Materials: Using paints, adhesives, and finishes that emit little to no volatile organic\ncompounds (VOCs) improves IAQ.\n● Proper Ventilation: Mechanical ventilation systems like ERVs or HRVs bring fresh air into the home while\nmaintaining energy efficiency. Natural ventilation through operable windows also helps enhance air quality.\n● Humidity Control: Managing indoor humidity levels reduces the risk of mold growth and contributes to a\nhealthier indoor environment.\n\nDesigning a Green Home\nSite Selection and Sustainable Landscaping\nThe location and landscaping of a green home are important factors in its overall sustainability:\n● Site Orientation: Positioning the home to take advantage of natural sunlight and wind patterns reduces the\nneed for artificial lighting, heating, and cooling.\n● Solar Shading: Incorporating shading devices like overhangs, awnings, or trees to prevent overheating in\nsummer months while allowing sunlight in winter.\n● Native and Drought-Tolerant Plants: Landscaping with native plants reduces the need for water and chemical\nfertilizers, supporting local ecosystems and promoting biodiversity.\n● Permeable Surfaces: Using permeable materials for driveways and walkways helps reduce stormwater runoff\nand promotes groundwater recharge.\n\nDesigning a Green Home - Case Study\nCasa GG (Yucatán, Mexico): A passive house design that uses local materials, natural ventilation, and shading to\nminimize energy consumption in a hot climate.\n\nGreen Building in Iraq\n● Iraq has a rich history of sustainable\nconstruction practices and eco-friendly\narchitecture.\n● Green building initiatives have been\ninstrumental in promoting sustainable\ndevelopment in Iraq.\n\nGreen Building in Iraq\nThe Green Zone's transformation in Baghdad showcases Iraq's commitment to sustainable development,\nserving as a symbol of resilience and innovation in post-war reconstruction. By incorporating green\narchitecture and energy-efficient designs, it demonstrates the potential for sustainable practices in\nrebuilding efforts. This model of development, if shared with other post-war countries like Afghanistan,\ncould lead to more resilient infrastructure and contribute to global sustainability efforts.\n\nGreen Building in Iraq\nTo address Iraq’s energy challenges, green\ntechnology and energy solutions are being\nimplemented. Solar energy, in particular, offers\na sustainable and reliable source of power. By\nharnessing this renewable energy source, Iraq\nnot only reduces its dependence on traditional\nenergy sources but also contributes to the\noverall goal of creating a greener and more\nsustainable environment.\n\nNotable Green Buildings and Sites in Iraq\nSite: Lalish Temple\nLocation: Nineveh Governorate\nFeatures: Traditional design,\nsustainable materials\nSite: Al Mutanabbi Street\nLocation: Baghdad\nFeatures: Sustainable pedestrian zone,\nsolar-powered lighting\nSite: LEED Certified Buildings - Al Qassim Green\nUniversity\nLocation: Babylon Governorate\nFeatures: Energy-efficient, environmentally\nresponsible construction\n\nCurrent Challenges in Construction in Iraq\nThe current challenges in Iraq’s construction sector stem from several factors:\n● Conflict-related Damage: Years of conflict, particularly with ISIL, have left much of Iraq’s\ninfrastructure severely damaged, including hospitals, schools, and homes.\n● Skill Shortages: Many engineers and skilled professionals left the country due to instability,\nleading to difficulties in finding the right expertise for specialized projects.\n● Sustainability Issues: There is a need to focus on sustainable reconstruction, ensuring\nlong-term access to essential services to prevent re-displacement.\n\nPrinciples of Green Building\nEnergy Efficiency Reduce energy consumption through passive design, efficient insulation,\nwindows, HVAC systems, and renewable energy like solar.\nWater Conservation Use low-flow fixtures, rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and\ndrought-tolerant landscaping to minimize water use.\nSustainable Materials Prioritize eco-friendly, low-embodied energy, recycled, and non-toxic\nmaterials to reduce environmental impact and improve indoor air quality.\nIndoor Air / Environmental Quality\n(IAQ/IEQ)\nEnhance ventilation, control moisture, and optimize lighting and acoustics\nto create healthy, comfortable indoor environments.\nSite Selection and Development Minimize environmental disruption through smart site selection,\nstormwater management, and preserving existing vegetation.\nWaste Reduction and Management Focus on recycling, reducing material use, and designing for disassembly to\nminimize waste.\nLife Cycle and Embodied Energy Consider the entire life cycle of materials to reduce embodied energy and\nenvironmental impact.\n\nPrinciples of Green Building\n\nPractical Steps for Implementing Green Building Solutions\n1.

SGS: Nanduz Restaurant Building, 4th floor No:17, 14 Tamuz Street, opposite Basra Hotel, 61001,\nBasra, Iraq\n2. Energo: Erbil , Nazobldg, 60m St. Near Jalil Khayat mosque 440011 Aldawly Bldg,Rubayie St.\nZayoona\n\nEnergy Audit: Cost Analysis in Air Conditioner and Lights\nAir Conditioner (A/C): The inverter conditioner units might be more expensive than the constant motor speed type,\nbut this is balanced by less electricity bills. In picture showing a comparison between the types of A/C with and\nwithout inverter considering power for same cooling capacity, A/C cost, bill cost over a period of time and total cost\nso it is worth noting that the most appropriate is to use A/C with inverter technique for power and money saving.\n\nEnergy Audit: Cost Analysis in Air Conditioner and Lights\nLights: The one of most efficient bulbs in the market are called compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs. The newest\ntechnology is light-emitting diodes (LEDs) the best energy save lighting technology are solid-state devices that\nconvert electric energy directly into light of a single color. The newest technology is light-emitting diodes (LEDs) the\nbest energy save lighting technology are solid-state devices that convert electric energy directly into light of a single\ncolor.\n\nMain Energy Usage in a Home in Iraq\n\nMain Energy Usage in a Home in Iraq\nElectricity is considered the prime source of energy for households in Iraq. Split type or window mounted\nair conditioners are used for cooling. Fans and evaporative coolers are more common in low-mid income\nhouses. Kerosene heaters are dominantly used during winters due to lack of electricity supply. Domestic\nsolar water heater (SWH) is seldom used in Iraq despite it could be a major contributor to the future energy\nsupply.\n\nMain Energy Usage in a Home in Iraq\n● The average monthly consumption for a medium income household for summer and winter months\nranges on average between 1,400 – 1,900 kWh per connection per month.\n● The monthly electricity consumption is calculated based on each connection using basic appliances\nsuch as refrigerators, washing machines, TVs, irons, lightings and one split type air conditioner and\nair evaporator during summer months as well as a hot water cylinder and electrical heater during\nwinter months.\n\nMain Energy Usage in a Home in Iraq\nCost Saving using LED lighting bulbs\n● The majority of the residential consumers in\nIraq are still using incandescent light bulbs\nwith few fluorescent light bulbs.\n● Most households in Iraq are still using\nincandescent light bulbs. The compact\nfluorescent light bulbs could achieve energy\nsaving up to 80 percent as compared to\nincandescent light bulbs.\n● Based on table, a widespread use of LEDs\ncould save about 2.45 TWh (Base Case)\ncompared to incandescent light bulbs, which\nare widely used in Iraq.\n\nMain Energy Usage in a Home in Iraq\nDaily Load Profile:\n● The average daily load of common house in Baghdad is 20 kWh/day without air-conditions\nload, meanwhile reaches to 50 kWh/day with two tons of refrigeration cycle air-conditioner\n(about 7 kW operation power).\n● Daily load profile is divided into two parts, fixed part and seasonally variable part\n○ Fixed part includes the appliances that used constantly throughout the year such as\nlighting, television, washing machine, computer... etc..\n○ Seasonally variable part includes the appliances that used in specific times throughout\nyear seasons, which is heating and cooling devices.\n\nFixed Load Appliances in Iraq\nThe average daily load of this part is resulted as 10.17 kWh/d while the annual energy consumption is 3712 kWh/yr.\nWashing machine considered to operate for about 3 hours, two times per week, which account about 1 hour per day\nas an average in normal house consumption profile estimated\n\nSeasonally Variable Load Appliances in Iraq\nOne refrigerator and one freezer are considered as minimum in this normal house. One unit of desert cooler is\nconsidered with 600 Watt power capacity for a moderate size as minimum number of air conditioner units in this\nnormal house profile.\n\nEnergy Sources in Iraq\nAccording to Baghdad Provincial Council About Generators:\nType Description\nNumber of Generators More than 13,000 registered private and government-owned neighborhood\ngenerators in Baghdad.\nElectricity Cost $6.50 for six hours/day to $10 per ampere for 24 hours.\nPrice per kWh US¢ 8-17/kWh\nElectricity Provided Neighborhood generators provide less than 15% of the total electricity\nconsumed.\nHousehold Spending Neighborhood generators capture more than 90% of household spending on\nelectricity, despite limited supply.\n\nEnergy Sources in Iraq\nGovernment-Provided Electricity\nIt is widely believed that electricity subsidy is one of the important variables that hinders the\neffectiveness of energy efficiency schemes in the Middle East. In Iraq, the government subsidy,\nwhich exceeds US$ 2.4 billion per annum, can be identified as a key variable which affects the\nstrength of energy efficiency measures and its use.\n\nEnergy Sources in Iraq\nGovernment-Provided Electricity\n● The low electricity price has discouraged any energy efficiency initiative and has had an\nadverse effect to inefficient usage of electricity. There is no motivation on the part of the\nconsumer for saving energy as long as the electricity tariff remains low.\n● There have been several attempts by the government in the past to raise the extremely low (or\nnear free) electricity tariffs but resulted in serious public unrest.\n● Many Iraqis view the electricity supply as mismanaged and believe the government is\nincapable of providing continuous electricity, especially during peak summer demand.\n● Citizens are frustrated by unreliable electricity supply and perceive poor governance as the\nroot cause.\n\nEnergy Design Tools\n● HEED: Home Energy Efficient\nDesign\nHEED is a user-friendly tool for designing\nenergy-efficient homes. It generates a baseline\nhome and lets you create up to nine more\nefficient versions. We can visualize savings,\ncosts, and emissions.
