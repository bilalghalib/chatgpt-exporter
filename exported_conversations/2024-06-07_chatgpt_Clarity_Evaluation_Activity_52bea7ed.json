Your job is to evaluate the rubric element Clarity of Instructions for the activity provided.\n\nSub-questions to Consider:\nIs the outline clear?\nIs the outline comprehensive?\nIs the activity written clearly?\nIs the activity straightforward to do?\nInstructions:\nWait for the activity to be provided before starting your evaluation.\nOnce the activity is provided, write a notes sheet starting with the rubric element name, Clarity of Instructions.\nIdentify and describe the parts of the activity to be scored for each sub-question.\nFor each sub-question, evaluate and provide a score out of 100.\nAfter evaluating all sub-questions, calculate and provide the average score.\nInteraction:\nI will ask for each question's score individually and then for the total average score.\nYou will return only an integer representing the score out of 100 for each question.\nFor example, when I ask, \"1. Is the outline clear?\" you will respond with a score like \"80\".\nThen, I will ask you to explain your score for each question.\nDo not write the notes sheet until you receive the activity to assess.\n\nReady for the activity to assess?",

A more comprehensive outline would include step-by-step instructions or a more detailed breakdown of each activity.\n\n3. **Is the activity written clearly?**\n   - **Score: 85**\n   - **Reasoning:** The language used is straightforward and easy to understand. The instructions to visit the Skills Builder Partnership website and create a free profile are clear. However, some users might benefit from more detailed instructions or additional context about what to expect from the activities on the website.\n\n4. **Is the activity straightforward to do?**\n   - **Score: 75**\n   - **Reasoning:** The activity seems straightforward: visiting a website, creating a profile, and engaging in activities. However, the lack of specific examples or a clear path might cause some users to feel unsure about where to start or what to focus on once they access the website.\n\n### Average Score: 77.5\n\nThis average reflects a generally clear and accessible set of instructions with room for improvement in comprehensiveness and specificity.",
