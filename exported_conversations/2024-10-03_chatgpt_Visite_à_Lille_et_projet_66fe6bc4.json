      "content": "Can you help me come up with a very simple summary of follow up points for this conversation? \nIt's between me and Gaell who works at the learning planet institute in paris\n00:00: Wow.\n31:57: Not really.\n32:18: I haven't looked at the calculation, but it's obvious that it saves a lot of signal.\n32:23: So yeah, yeah, exactly.\n32:26: I am used to it now, and it's interesting to see who is in the black and white mood and who is that.\n32:32: Yeah.\n33:06: Yeah.\n33:08: Well, please, yeah.\n33:11: Thanks for reaching out.\n33:12: It's so cool that we have an opportunity to catch up.\n33:16: You're in Lille.\n33:29: So I am definitely going to reach out because my daughter is in Lille.\n33:38: And, so I am going to Lill in two weeks.\n33:45: Because for her birthday, we're going to make her a surprise and go on the 11th.\n34:00: It's a Friday.\n34:01: And we stay over on the Saturday.\n34:04: So, does it be cool?\n34:12: Yeah.\n34:23: No, yeah.\n34:32: That's cool.\n34:35: On the last note, Bilal, I am pretty sure you know these, I don't know what's the name of it, but these amazing towers where you have pigeons.\n41:59: Yeah, and so, and there's a lot of holes so that the pigeon can home, home in.\n42:12: And so this is something that you can find from Iran to Mauritania.\n42:18: All across Africa and Middle East.\n42:22: And it's a very ancient way to actually create.\n42:27: I mean, it's an amazing design because it's.\n42:31: At first, you just look like you only have pigeonholes, right?\n42:34: But what the pigeon do is that they stay here overnight.\n42:39: And so in the middle of the tower, every day, you can recover the guano.\n42:44: And the guano is so rich that you can use it for the agriculture and so it's super easy way to concentrate the guano right and can you uh align me on one specific topic which is I think I get the idea of the project.\n44:06: What I am still struggling with is what is your exact role within this project?\n44:12: That is, it is so huge, right?\n44:14: And I am not going to contract with the builders, etc.\n44:18: I mean, what is it that you do?\n44:20: And what are the teams, what is the workforce around this?\n44:25: How is it structured so that you can actually deliver this for an entire city?\n44:29: Yeah.\n45:34: All right.\n46:31: All right.\n46:32: So thanks.\n46:34: That helps.\n46:35: So when it comes to validating the curriculum, I mean, I haven't seen the curricula and it would take me a lot of time to go through it, I guess, and I presume I am not sure I am the best person to do it.\n46:48: So two things.\n46:50: One is the way that I would approach it is I would insist on the principles for designing sustainability.\n47:01: And because you don't know what are the local conditions and you cannot think of all the local conditions whether you know how to do this or that and there is always this arbitrary so back so it's hard to uh it's hard to structure the curricula to say exactly what is it that you should do or what is it that you shouldn't do because it's still going to depend a lot on the local conditions.\n47:40: However, a clear understanding of the design principles help make decisions when you have to, you know, Either you rebuild from what you have or you import new material because they are better or whatever They could do a lot of that and so, and I am not especially an expert in construction, but I can see that you always have to It's all going to be about trade-off.\n48:07: And so, sustainability is all about trade-off.\n48:09: And so that implies a lot of thinking in terms of systemic analysis These are big words, but just to say that since it's complex and you have to optimize in different dimensions, so maybe you optimize for water, but at the same time, if you do this, you increase the energy consumption or vis-a-versa, you know, So I guess the way that I would do it is I would try to do one generic course on sustainability which is, but this is my mental model, so it's just, I just applied the logic.\n48:51: To apply to construction here is to say these are the things that we need to take care of when it comes to sustainability so these are the resources that we are missing and these are the things that we need to be careful of and mindful of especially in that context of course water is going to be a very big deal but that everyone knows over there but maybe are less mindful of the importance of nitrogen and phosphorus, of the energy that is required to transport loads and tons, etc.\n49:28: So there are things here where, you know, designed lighter, design, with the planetary boundaries in mind and try to make sure that everything that you do is easier to recycle.\n49:43: Where do you source the material from?\n49:47: What kind of material it is?\n49:49: Is it weighty or lighty?\n49:52: And when you have to rebuild after, is it easy to recycle?\n49:56: Or can you recycle things that are around to actually build?\n50:00: All these sort of things is important as principles.\n50:04: And I would be heavy on principles first and then take a few examples of how those principles are interests can be combined or can be documented or illustrated through major realization.\n50:22: And you showed me two papers that have been published by scholars.\n50:26: I haven't read those papers, but I guess they are dealing with these sort of things, and they have all kind of indicators around recycling and the origin of materials and easy to build and energy consumption and CO2 emissions etc.\n50:41: If we are doing the right work, right?\n50:43: So it might be interesting to have an analysis of these sort of examples, but through the lens of the guiding principles.\n50:52: And so if you establish those principles first, the rest is quite easy.\n50:56: And after that, because you should imagine being in the shoe of the people that at the end are going to be doing the work.\n51:08: And so if I had time and money, I would spend some time with those people to understand what they understand of sustainability and how they build things now.\n51:21: So what they already do well and what they Miss. And then you concentrate on what they miss because this is where the teaching is going to be very relevant for them.\n51:32: And an additional thought is that you cited two papers from scholars that are in the field.\n51:42: Maybe you want to reach out to them if you have not done it already and ask them to somehow give their opinion on your ideas and curricula because that would be quite interesting to have their, I mean, as a.\n51:58: As a seal, as a, you know, as a, when it comes to validation, they are presumably in the right place.\n52:07: Yeah, this is something that you need to look for.\n53:06: I don't know.\n53:07: I worked on resilience of infrastructure 15 years ago, but that's a long time ago.\n53:13: And so, yeah, I had all set of indicators for resilience at this stage, which is not exactly sustainability.\n53:19: It's only one component of it.\n53:20: But so what I know is that there is so much work on this.\n53:25: That's so much, right?\n53:27: And, so I am sure you're going to find interesting stuff.\n53:31: You may want to look into UNEP and UN habitat, especially UN habitat.\n53:37: I am pretty sure there, because at the time, I wrote a report for UNEP on sustainable cities.\n53:44: With all kind of indicators.\n53:46: And, so I was, I did a review of the indicators that were the set of indicators for sustainable cities and my conclusion is that none of them were actually sustainable because none of them were grounded on planetary health and planetary boundaries.\n54:04: So you need to look at what exists and hopefully in 15 years things have changed and maybe UN Habitat has now or the World Bank have now papers on what is it that needs to be taken care of or what are the parameters that are important when it comes to designing or redesigning habitat in lighty and sustainable way in different regions because it's so region-based, so local.\n54:35: Yeah, it's a good point.\n55:44: I don't know the students, I haven't seen them yet because we just, they just started.\n55:49: So the master, the M2, the M1.\n55:52: I am going to give them courses starting next week, so I am going to meet them.\n55:57: I don't know what is the best way to do this?\n56:02: I can discuss that with the.\n56:03: Maybe the best is for you to contact the master people and generally ask them that this is something that you have, that you might be interesting for students.\n56:19: Maybe this is an internship for one of them.\n56:23: I don't know if you have the money to spend on this, on an internship?\n56:30: Where someone would you, so do you know, let me, yeah, right, right?\n56:53: So, So this is my recommendation.\n56:57: You reach out to them and you ask you, this is my project and I would like to know whether it could be of interest in, I would love to have the feedback from the students.\n57:07: Is there a way I can interact with them in the context of the master as it is?\n57:12: And or can do you think there is a possibility for me to create an internship for them?\n57:17: And if so, what is the process?\n57:19: Yeah.\n57:32: So that's a very good point.\n58:06: So I have one student from the master from last year who wanted to create a version in Arabic?\n58:13: So there is you are at least two of them now.\n58:17: So the more the better.\n58:20: There is no plan for doing it.\n58:22: We are translating in English and in Spanish as we speak using AI.\n58:29: And maybe you can, yeah, maybe we can just, for the beginning, we can just use transcripts.\n58:39: And, so I can provide you with the transcripts in French and English for the first videos for the solution space.\n58:51: We only have the YouTube one which are not so good.\n58:57: But we should have them in English, in a good English, when we have proofread the automatic translation from the AI.\n59:06: So it should come.\n59:08: So, yeah.\n59:10: I would be super happy to have a version translated in Arabic if that's useful, so I can give you any content.\n59:17: The only thing is I cannot do it myself because I don't have the time, and I am and my Arabic is not so fresh.\n59:25: Bon corns.\n59:40: I would be happy to do this and squeeze.",
