      "content": "Good question! 🐌 Snail reproduction is fascinating because most land snails are **simultaneous hermaphrodites** — meaning each individual has both male and female reproductive organs at the same time.  \n\nHere’s how it usually works:  \n\n- **Both partners have sperm and eggs.** When two snails mate, they can both act as male and female.  \n- **They exchange sperm.** Each snail transfers sperm to the other, usually using a special organ called a *love dart* in some species (it actually increases the chance of fertilization).  \n- **They can both lay eggs afterward.** After mating, each snail can fertilize its own eggs with the received sperm and then lay eggs in the soil.  \n\nSo to answer your question:  \n👉 No, one of them doesn’t “stay male” — they’re both male *and* female at the same time. Sometimes one acts more like the “male” (delivering sperm) and the other like the “female” (receiving), but often they switch roles or both exchange sperm in the same encounter.  \n\nSome aquatic snails, though (like apple snails or freshwater pond snails), **are not hermaphrodites** — they have separate males and females.  \n\nWould you like me to explain the difference between how your little **garden snail** at home likely reproduces vs. **aquatic snails** (like aquarium ones)?",
