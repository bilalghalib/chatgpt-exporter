These charts will visually represent sales data over the years, allowing us to see which products are becoming more or less popular. Specifically, I'll focus on the sales from 2016 to 2023 to determine the trends. Let's start by creating these charts.",

The chart visually represents how the sales of each product have changed over these years. \n\nTo determine which products are gaining or losing popularity:\n- **Increasing Trend**: Products whose sales lines are moving upward over the years indicate growing popularity.\n- **Decreasing Trend**: Products with downward trending lines indicate declining popularity.\n- **Consistent or Fluctuating**: Some products might show a consistent trend or fluctuate year to year without a clear increase or decrease.\n\nFrom the chart, you can identify which products follow these patterns. As for whether \"Petrichor Mitti Attar\" is always winning, you can compare its trend line with others. If it consistently shows higher sales or a more pronounced upward trend compared to others, it can be considered as consistently popular or gaining popularity over the years.\n\nIf you need a more detailed analysis or specific comparisons, feel free to ask!",

After the overview, I'll select five that would be most helpful for your analysis.\n\n1. **Line Graph (Yearly Sales Trends)**\n   - **Pro**: Clearly shows trends over time for each product.\n   - **Con**: Can become cluttered if there are many products.\n\n2. **Bar Chart (Total Sales per Product)**\n   - **Pro**: Easy comparison of total sales between products.\n   - **Con**: Does not show how sales have changed over time.\n\n3. **Stacked Bar Chart (Yearly Sales Breakdown)**\n   - **Pro**: Displays yearly sales while showing total sales per product.\n   - **Con**: Can be hard to compare individual years between products.\n\n4. **Pie Chart (Market Share)**\n   - **Pro**: Shows each product's share of total sales.\n   - **Con**: Not effective for showing trends over time.\n\n5. **Heat Map (Sales Intensity by Year)**\n   - **Pro**: Visualizes the density of sales per product per year.\n   - **Con**: Harder to read exact figures compared to bar or line charts.\n\n6. **Area Chart (Cumulative Sales Over Time)**\n   - **Pro**: Shows how total sales have built up over time for each product.\n   - **Con**: Can be hard to distinguish individual year contributions.\n\n7. **Scatter Plot (Year vs. Sales)**\n   - **Pro**: Good for identifying outliers and patterns in sales data.\n   - **Con**: Less intuitive for showing trends compared to line or bar charts.\n\n8. **Histogram (Sales Distribution)**\n   - **Pro**: Useful for seeing the distribution of sales amounts.\n   - **Con**: Does not display sales by product or over time.\n\n9. **Box Plot (Sales Variability)**\n   - **Pro**: Great for visualizing sales variability and detecting outliers.\n   - **Con**: Does not provide specific trend information.\n\n10. **Bubble Chart (Sales Volume and Product Variety)**\n    - **Pro**: Represents sales volume, product variety, and can include time as a third dimension.\n    - **Con**: Can be complex and harder to interpret.\n\nFrom these options, the following five would provide a comprehensive and clear analysis of your sales data:\n\n1. **Line Graph (Yearly Sales Trends)**: Ideal for observing how each product's popularity has changed annually.\n2. **Bar Chart (Total Sales per Product)**: Useful for a straightforward comparison of each product's overall performance.\n3. **Heat Map (Sales Intensity by Year)**: Provides a visually compelling way to compare the concentration of sales across products and years.\n4. **Stacked Bar Chart (Yearly Sales Breakdown)**: Offers a view of each product's yearly sales contribution to its total sales.\n5. **Box Plot (Sales Variability)**: Aids in understanding the range and distribution of sales for each product, highlighting any outliers or inconsistencies.\n\nBy utilizing these five types of graphs, you can gain insights into the overall performance, yearly trends, sales distribution, and product popularity within your dataset.",
