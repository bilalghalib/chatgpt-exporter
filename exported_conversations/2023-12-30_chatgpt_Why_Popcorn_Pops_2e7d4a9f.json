      "content": "Popcorn pops because inside each kernel is a tiny bit of water. When you heat popcorn in the microwave, the water turns into steam and builds up pressure, just like a tiny balloon filling up with air. Eventually, the pressure gets so high that the kernel explodes and turns inside out, puffing up into the popcorn we eat! It's like a little steam engine inside each kernel making a pop sound when it bursts open!",
