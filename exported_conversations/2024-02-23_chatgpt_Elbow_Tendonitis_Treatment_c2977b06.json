      "content": "So I have a new baby and I'm starting to work out and I think I have tendonitis in my elbow. How can I diagnose it? It just kind of hurts when I carry stuff in it. I think it's because I use this left arm to put under my baby's butt and the pressure of his weight is kind of an awkward thing for my elbow. I want to make sure that I don't aggravate it and that it heals so I can start exercising. What are things that I can do to treat it and does that sound like a right diagnosis?",

      "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing some discomfort in your elbow, possibly due to the new stress of carrying your baby. Tendonitis is a common condition, but it's important to get a proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional. They can assess your symptoms and possibly perform tests to confirm if it's tendonitis or something else.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips for managing elbow discomfort:\n\n1. Rest: Try to avoid activities that worsen the pain, especially those that involve repetitive elbow movement.\n\n2. Ice: Applying ice to the area can reduce inflammation and pain. Do this for about 15-20 minutes every few hours.\n\n3. Over-the-counter pain relief: Medications like ibuprofen can help reduce pain and swelling.\n\n4. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises: Once the pain starts to decrease, gentle exercises can help strengthen the muscles around the elbow. But be careful not to overdo it.\n\nRemember, these are just general suggestions. It's really important to see a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation. They can also give you advice on how to safely return to exercise without aggravating your elbow.",
