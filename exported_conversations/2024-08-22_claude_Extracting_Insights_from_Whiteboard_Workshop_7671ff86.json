The discussion covered several key areas: energy, construction, environment, training, and local innovation.\n\nKey insights:\n\n1. Energy: There's a significant disparity between subsidized (10 dinars/kWh) and unsubsidized (100 dinars/kWh) electricity costs. The potential removal of subsidies could dramatically change the economic argument for solar energy adoption. The average home in Mosul requires about 40Amp of power.\n\n2. Construction: There's a need for more efficient building management systems, especially in government buildings. The concept of net-zero buildings was discussed as a potential solution. Recycling construction waste and implementing sustainable building practices were identified as opportunities.\n\n3. Environment: Dust on solar panels presents a challenge for solar energy adoption. The current lighting systems in Mosul are often inefficient and aesthetically unappealing, presenting an opportunity for improvement.\n\n4. Training: The group recognized the importance of flexible training schedules to accommodate busy lifestyles. Long-term training programs (9+ months) were suggested, with a focus on building a sustainability mindset and character strengths.\n\n5. Innovation: There's a desire to identify and amplify local innovations in sustainability. Creating a catalog of sustainability challenges and solutions was proposed as a tool for entrepreneurship training.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Develop a comprehensive catalog of sustainability challenges and solutions specific to Mosul.\n2. Design flexible training programs that focus on sustainability and entrepreneurship, incorporating character strength building.\n3. Explore partnerships or initiatives to implement efficient building management systems, especially in government buildings.\n4. Research and promote local innovations in sustainable practices.\n5. Conduct a more detailed analysis of the potential impact of removing energy subsidies on sustainable initiatives.\n6. Investigate and potentially import more efficient and aesthetically pleasing lighting solutions.\n7. Explore vernacular architecture techniques for improving natural air circulation in buildings.\n\nThis meeting has laid a foundation for future sustainability efforts in Mosul, identifying key challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions across various sectors. The emphasis on local innovation, practical training, and addressing immediate environmental concerns shows a holistic approach to sustainability in the region.",

Introduction\n\nThis report synthesizes information from multiple sources, including the Mosul Sustainability and Reconstruction meeting, the Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS), traditional Arabic architectural elements, and local initiatives in Mosul. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of sustainability efforts and challenges in the region.\n\n## 2. Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS)\n\n### Overview\nThe GZRS is an environmental assessment system for buildings in Iraq, developed by the University of Mosul. It evaluates the sustainability of both existing and new buildings across various categories.\n\n### Significance\nThe ziggurat symbol represents the historical and cultural identity of Iraq, connecting modern sustainability efforts with ancient architectural wisdom.\n\n### Rating Categories and Weightings\n| Category | Percentage |\n|----------|------------|\n| Energy efficiency | 30% |\n| Water efficiency | 28% |\n| Materials and resources | 12% |\n| Indoor environmental quality | 12% |\n| Site sustainability | 10% |\n| Regional priority | 5% |\n| Innovation | 3% |\n\n### Certification Levels\n- Platinum: 100-80 points\n- Gold: 79-60 points\n- Silver: 59-50 points\n- Bronze: 49-40 points\n\n### Objectives\n1. Provide a unified Iraqi standard for building sustainability\n2. Reduce negative environmental impacts of buildings\n3. Raise awareness among designers about sustainable buildings\n4. Enhance urban environment and identity in Iraqi cities\n\n### Implementation\nThe University of Mosul will formulate and implement the system, with application guides for different building types.\n\n## 3. Traditional Arabic Architectural Elements for Climate Adaptation\n\n### Urban Planning Elements\n1. Narrow streets and alleys\n2. Compact urban fabric\n   - Retains cool air\n   - Reduces heat gain\n   - Blocks hot, dust-laden winds\n\n### Building Design Elements\n1. Courtyard (Fina')\n   - Central element for natural lighting and cooling\n2. Building Envelope\n   - Thick walls for thermal mass\n   - Decorative elements for shading\n   - Use of materials with low thermal conductivity (limestone, gypsum, marble)\n3. Roof Design\n   - Domes and vaults for reduced heat gain and improved air circulation\n4. Basements (Sirdab)\n   - Used for various purposes, including summer siestas\n   - Equipped with wind catchers (Badgir)\n5. Arcades\n   - Provide shading and transitional spaces\n6. Iwan\n   - Three-walled, roofed space open to the courtyard\n7. Mashrabiya\n   - Wooden lattice screens for privacy and cooling\n\n### Natural Ventilation Elements\n1. Wind Catcher (Badgir)\n   - Captures and directs cool breezes into the building\n2. Wind Tower\n   - Creates air circulation through temperature and pressure differences\n\n### Air Humidification Elements\n1. Fountain\n   - Central element in courtyards and basements for evaporative cooling\n2. Salsabil\n   - Decorative water chute for increased evaporation and humidity\n\n## 4. Local Initiatives and Challenges in Mosul\n\n### Mosul Heritage Initiative\n- Started as a social media platform \"Mosul Heritage\"\n- Evolved into a volunteer group conducting awareness campaigns and tours\n- Established a foundation in a historical building after negotiations\n\n### Challenges\n1. Destruction of historical sites and the old city (80% destroyed)\n2. Need for documentation of oral history and traditions\n3. Balancing reconstruction with preservation of cultural identity\n\n### Opportunities\n1. Volunteer-led awareness campaigns and tours\n2. Establishment of a museum with donations from local residents\n3. Partnership with other organizations for virtual experiences\n4. Studio for recording oral history and traditions\n\n## 5. Key Insights and Considerations\n\n1. Integration of Traditional and Modern: There's a strong focus on combining modern sustainable practices with traditional building designs, as evidenced by both the GZRS and local initiatives.\n\n2. Cultural Preservation: The destruction of historical sites has heightened awareness of the need to preserve cultural identity through both physical restoration and documentation of oral traditions.\n\n3. Local Innovation Focus: There's an emphasis on identifying and amplifying local innovations, such as traditional cooling methods and adaptations to the hot, dry climate.\n\n4. Comprehensive Approach: The GZRS covers a wide range of sustainability aspects, complementing the holistic training programs proposed in local initiatives.\n\n5. Community Engagement: Local initiatives demonstrate strong community involvement, from volunteering for awareness campaigns to donating artifacts for the museum.\n\n6. Academic-Practice Bridge: The development of the GZRS by the University of Mosul creates a strong link between academic research and practical application.\n\n7. Climate Adaptation: Traditional architectural elements provide valuable insights into passive cooling and climate adaptation strategies that can be incorporated into modern designs.\n\n8. Energy Efficiency Priority: The high weighting of energy efficiency in the GZRS (30%) aligns with the challenges identified in traditional architecture and local climate conditions.\n\n## 6. Low-Hanging Fruit\n\n1. Integrating GZRS into local training and awareness programs\n2. Developing case studies of buildings at different GZRS certification levels\n3. Implementing simple, traditional cooling methods in new constructions and retrofits\n4. Establishing a battery recycling program to address concerns about imported battery quality\n5. Improving water heating efficiency in homes\n6. Leveraging university projects and the new sustainability department for practical applications\n7. Expanding the oral history recording project to document traditional knowledge and practices\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n\n1. Develop a comprehensive, component-based training program incorporating:\n   - Advocacy phase: Social media campaign\n   - Activation phase: Comparing modern and heritage building designs\n   - Action phase: Home surveys and efficiency improvement designs\n\n2. Create partnerships with Mosul University to:\n   - Integrate final year projects with local sustainability initiatives\n   - Collaborate on GZRS implementation and case studies\n\n3. Conduct detailed studies on:\n   - Energy usage in Mosul homes, focusing on heating and cooling requirements\n   - Effectiveness of traditional architectural elements in modern contexts\n\n4. Create a catalog of:\n   - Local innovations in sustainability\n   - Traditional cooling and climate adaptation methods\n\n5. Design experiential learning opportunities:\n   - Green space experiences as part of training curricula\n   - Hands-on workshops on traditional building techniques\n\n6. Develop guidelines for:\n   - Retrofitting existing buildings to improve energy efficiency\n   - Incorporating traditional elements into new constructions\n\n7. Expand the oral history project:\n   - Record interviews with local experts on traditional architecture and practices\n   - Create a searchable database of traditional knowledge\n\n8. Investigate the feasibility of:\n   - Piezoelectric roads for energy generation\n   - Large-scale implementation of wind catchers and other traditional cooling methods\n\n9. Organize a workshop bringing together:\n   - GZRS developers\n   - Local initiative leaders\n   - Traditional architecture experts\n   - Sustainability practitioners\n\n10.

On what works with the pocket of the hypit.\n\n00:01:04 SPK_1\nYes.\n00:01:05 SPK_3\nBThe areas covered by the programmed parts.\n00:01:07 SPK_2\nThis is one of the things that I started hearing from people's hobby, I mean all the whole world\nda pay and say Yalla let us go black and Ako Shams, I don't know what?\n00:01:16 SPK_1\nBut the overall youth.\n00:01:18 SPK_2\nThey say that what is worth, they are settling the pain of calculations. They see the cost of\nbatteries.\n00:01:24 SPK_3\nAnd in winter.\n00:01:25 SPK_1\nAnd they don't have electricity cuts, you are the one who didn't produce nuclear energy for\nthem. Diesel is like this they will go to it as a pyramid continue M who will add sustainability\nenergy, will reduce Yes for example diesel and so on, yes, but this is still the level of EFL it no\nlonger cuts electricity Yes yes less has the EA\n00:01:46 SPK_2\nHas.\n00:01:47 SPK_3\nSource, now source processing.\n00:01:48 SPK_1\nThe source of processing Elly is the.\n00:01:52 SPK_2\nYes, yes.\n00:01:53 SPK_1\nIn Iraq, you enter it until you do not guarantee.\n00:01:57 SPK_2\nYes.\n\n00:01:59 SPK_1\nThe working this problem so go to the HighPad, the Highpad is expensive.\n00:02:04 SPK_2\nAye and then people mean for what then? Is the solution? Attention. In Mosul and Iraq?\nBecause if I stuff with people and stop thinking that the picture will be in the future they have a\nhobby, people say\n00:02:16 SPK_1\nYou don't need to say a high opinion\n00:02:17 SPK_2\nHigh cost. Battery switch. I don't know what batteries cost him.\n00:02:21 SPK_3\nIts cost is high, compared to. The subsidized electricity.\n00:02:26 SPK_2\nEE, Ish Lone.\n00:02:28 SPK_3\nWe have almost 90% subsidies on electricity, so one unit is E. It's ten dinars.\n00:02:36 SPK_2\nYes.\n00:02:36 SPK_3\nFor home sanf zen, whereas. He's one hundred hundred E.\n00:02:44 SPK_2\nWa wa wa 128 wants to interact on it.\n00:02:48 SPK_1\nYes. 90%.\n00:02:49 SPK_3\nDoes it cost one hundred?\n00:02:50 SPK_2\nI mean, we have to make it the other way around. The government supports the hahaha and\nevacuates solar energy.\n00:02:56 SPK_3\n\nThey are the two Aldo, the government loses when it loses, what it may produce, more than it\nloses more, or why? Because you're going to get more ready, you're going to be born more\nmom, and therefore you're going to lose more with the home variety.\n00:03:12 SPK_2\nDecorate the variety.\n00:03:13 SPK_3\nHousehold, one unit starts from ten dinars. The commercial variety.\n00:03:21 SPK_3\nIt starts from 60/60 JOD starting from 60/60 JOD.\n00:03:25 SPK_2\nUnity.\n00:03:25 SPK_3\nWhat's the commercial's mouth?\n00:03:30 SPK_1\nAh patriotism?\n00:03:31 SPK_3\nFor the the.\n00:03:32 SPK_1\nSolar discord is working by day, meaning commercial what it has at night. A little.\n00:03:39 SPK_3\nWe have these yet. Here we have the agricultural, maybe too.\n00:03:48 SPK_3\nStarts from 60 planting, or 60 lumps.\n00:03:51 SPK_1\nBut is it difficult to access the Internet?\n00:03:53 SPK_2\nFor agricultural?\n00:03:56 SPK_1\nOn his account they pull a line from the nearest source. Columns and such, if he comes to\ncalculate them, for example, narrate, narrate.\n\n00:04:07 SPK_2\nOne means. The study is for the cost and for the hundred?\n00:04:13 SPK_3\nIn percent e-hundred?\n00:04:14 SPK_2\nPercent certain, and what is it worth? The what? What is equal between the A and God?\n00:04:19 SPK_1\nNot yet? It's farmers?\n00:04:21 SPK_3\nIrrigation Pal irrigation.\n00:04:22 SPK_1\nPumping means pumps are used by the whole trend on solar energy.\n00:04:27 SPK_2\nYes.\n00:04:28 SPK_1\nFarmer, that's who?\n00:04:30 SPK_3\nWho is the economic feasibility?\n00:04:32 SPK_2\nI mean, it helps?\n00:04:36 SPK_3\nEconomic Prostration in agricultural Oki, especially those far from it young people.\n00:04:41 SPK_1\nFar away from the remote Arius potential.\n00:04:47 SPK_2\nEBS means that government support is a big part of the problem.\n00:04:53 SPK_3\nSupporting us what we completed for you after all this government item, the price starts fixed,\nmeaning 120.\n00:05:02 SPK_1\n\nHi.\n00:05:03 SPK_3\nState government departments.\n00:05:05 SPK_2\nHere is 120 dinars.\n00:05:07 SPK_3\nThis is very economical.\n00:05:09 SPK_2\nIt shows the kilowatts.\n00:05:12 SPK_3\nIt is.\n00:05:15 SPK_2\nAll ie.\n00:05:20 SPK_3\nYes, there is no high support, high on the government.\n00:05:24 SPK_2\nThat's the right price of 120.\n00:05:27 SPK_3\nOh I mean with profit of course profit for yes to the Ministry of Electricity yes\n00:05:31 SPK_2\nBut I mean this should be the regular price?\n00:05:39 SPK_1\nMean the.\n00:05:40 SPK_3\nThe cost once calculated it is 108 percent.\n00:05:44 SPK_2\nDays mean.\n00:05:47 SPK_1\nA almost Elly.\n\n00:05:49 SPK_2\nYes.\n00:05:51 SPK_1\nWe cost one cent.\n00:05:54 SPK_2\nI mean this. This price is only a timing, what could mean saving electricity, the government's\nmoney is problematic per day?\n00:06:04 SPK_3\nMaha according to the area that he has is the area of the roofs that he has dictated by him, it\nmay be consumed more, because he knows the state departments of it, such as a building by\nreturning the floors of any building, i.e. a roof with little money. What. What covers the What's\nhis name?\n00:06:22 SPK_3\nBut at least it returns a little bit to the network, i.e. 20%, 2025.\n00:06:28 SPK_1\nin water. If, if.\n00:06:34 SPK_3\nIf diesel is installed, the state departments will return 20% of the EA or 25% of the energy they\nconsume.\n00:06:43 SPK_2\nYes.\n00:06:43 SPK_3\nThis is in case of this. In the event that it is a permanence ako, but who becomes a Friday and\na Saturday E, this directly returns to each E.\n00:06:51 SPK_2\nYes, it's what you use Hi.\n00:06:53 SPK_3\nThey are Beha. Should you be considered an economic committee? I mean what is the fate of\nwhat is right? What would you benefit from?\n00:06:59 SPK_1\nMay Networko benefit?\n00:07:00 SPK_3\n\nWhat will you benefit, no, what is wrong with Aden? Tell? Opposite Abdullah. We didn't\nrecognize our professor.\n00:07:10 SPK_2\nMr. Bilal. Mr. Bilal.\n00:07:14 SPK_2\nWorld.\n00:07:14 SPK_3\nWorld Trade Center, eh?\n00:07:16 SPK_2\nHe is Iraqi. No, it'll be like. He.\n00:07:22 SPK_2\nAh I mean he designs training approaches, sweet programs and so on with the IGC currently\nhe is very interested in the field. What about these Yemeni topics, is this reason? I am trying? I\nlearn how much you can from you that I mean originally a regular business trainer, I train people\nin a deposit, I train people in times by programming, I train people on the shelves intelligence,\nbut on this subject I have been working on it since 2014 in a way that is training, but I mean the\nIraqi reality.\n00:07:54 SPK_2\nAnd these are the numbers. Understanding.\n00:07:59 SPK_2\nThen we try to do training, not just awareness, awareness, and oh, to the extent that one can\nanswer, he starts to create with it, he knows what the problem is from something until he knows\nwhere they work in it, right? I mean he should see ha okay, these prices are good so maybe we\nbring them closer to homes, no it is permissible I mean if we share a battery with a\nneighborhood what changes, if what I mean all one must understand saying these things, so I\nneed to know these things so that I put them in the design, so that people when they have\nawareness and understand the problem Can they cast business solutions may?\n00:08:33 SPK_3\nEconomical, what not, what means by poor housing.\n00:08:36 SPK_1\nAny weak?\n00:08:37 SPK_3\nBut yes, but with the agricultural, we said the commercial succeeded, can it succeed?\n\n00:08:44 SPK_2\nA course for the government?\n00:08:45 SPK_3\nWhy?\n00:08:46 SPK_1\nBy God, they are satisfied with quantities, which means an amount in which Uncle J.\n00:08:49 SPK_3\nLet and industrial what. He's gone. a. It's just going to reduce the bill.\n00:08:54 SPK_1\nYes I mean from the bill yes but I mean what you tell me about it?\n00:08:57 SPK_2\nNo, no, I don't have B without one battery.\n00:08:59 SPK_3\nNo battery.\n00:09:00 SPK_2\nRide it and miss it and the wall reduces the bill.\n00:09:04 SPK_3\nOf course sweet. The bill reduces by 20% may be 15% IE reduced.\n00:09:08 SPK_1\nTo me.\n00:09:09 SPK_3\nIs this the lab?\n00:09:11 SPK_2\nWhat does it mean?\n00:09:14 SPK_3\nThe factories are running the factories which are Astor and ABP and so on.\n00:09:19 SPK_1\nBy God, Elly Elly I ask prefers his birth, and Kaz means.\n00:09:24 SPK_3\nYou see the store. Here Turkey tariff is more than. From Iraq, many, Jordan the same, Syria the\n\nsame.\n00:09:35 SPK_2\nAny. Have mercy on him.\n00:09:38 SPK_1\nWe are supported.

The economy has changed day by day.\n00:09:54 SPK_2\n1500 A to the dollar to 150,000 in dollars how many years? One year, two years, at the same\ntime, I mean, they were one house that is permissible to have solar energy, and all of it, almost\nall of Lebanon, we see Beirut full of solar, and what has changed is a hobby, but the price of oil\nhas changed, meaning the price, the cost of oil to the people, because it is. Stop having a\nstrong dollar. Correct? The lira is strong. Yes.\n00:10:24 SPK_1\nIs he more photographed than that? If you know her, they can increase it.\n00:10:27 SPK_3\n100% know it.\n00:10:29 SPK_1\nHeading means if Iraq lifts subsidies on mesh.\n00:10:32 SPK_3\nStill political problems? No, what?\n00:10:34 SPK_2\nIf at least he doesn't put the AL I mean the charge, I mean I heard that until you buy banos and\nbatteries Ako Ako means a taxi, what can we say?\n00:10:46 SPK_1\nTaxi raised? By God, you don't have to do what there is in it in a taxi in Iraq.\n00:10:50 SPK_2\nRaised black. Okay. Good hopefully. These are things.\n00:10:54 SPK_2\nHi.

With the sheikha of sesame sesame tahini?\n00:17:40 SPK_1\nA while ago, maybe a month ago, instruct?\n00:17:42 SPK_2\nBut women.\n00:17:46 SPK_1\nNor did he ask me.\n00:18:08 SPK_2\nOf course, in the field. Yes?\n00:18:13 SPK_1\nA working story?\n00:18:18 SPK_2\nBecause your site you love the look.\n00:18:27 SPK_3\nLet's make a reservation here.\n00:18:31 SPK_2\nDon't you have my shirt? It's just what I mean by the things that are the escapes for me.\n\n00:18:48 SPK_5\nFor example, in general.\n00:18:56 SPK_2\nWhy are you standing?\n00:19:01 SPK_5\nLike in general that they use?\n00:19:06 SPK_2\nRotate.\n00:19:08 SPK_5\nI mean, like AAA, for example, passenger materials.\n00:19:12 SPK_2\nPassenger material.\n00:19:14 SPK_5\nRubble in general, we are currently the most likely to count the rubble because of the war. The\nbuildings were demolished, so they can use them and recycle them.\n00:19:26 SPK_2\nI mean, have you heard that there are Hitchy projects?\n00:19:29 SPK_5\nBy app?\n00:19:31 SPK_2\nYes, but what one color uses them. But not with me, and God's mercy and blessings. Peace be\nupon you. Bilal that reminded me of the name of Dr. Omar here we are honored. What color are\nyou? Thank God everything is good.\n00:19:44 SPK_3\nBut I want to ask Dr. Bassam does he have any should he offer it or not?\n00:19:48 SPK_2\nNo, what. It doesn't have to be shown, but I'm the most encouraging people, I mean if they\nhave. Presentation Bring it. This is the meaning of presentation, the idea is clear, every Mays\nwill be I mean follow an idea, so if Dr. Bassam Brad participates about the and wants to gather\npeople who are stuffed about this, he takes this I mean he interprets it in a way that is free to\nparticipate a little, and then he sits here, and the people who like it I mean continue with this\nidea we do\n\n00:20:21 SPK_2\nBut I mean without slides, I mean you will simplify it, what? As much as you can I mean he tells\nhim to stop talking, I tell you and yesterday yes he is just stepping on me and that's it, I mean\nthank God he has a big and wide knowledge, so hopefully, we hopefully see him, and a E B\nstarted without sliders hopefully, hopefully hopefully Oh P means in English this is called\nasthma, right? Yes, you see anywhere in the other world, people use it for.\n00:20:54 SPK_5\nThey used it at the end of the last period 2020 what do you use it in Gaza M Hess,\nunfortunately the events used it a in Australia yes Australia also used it and maybe in Norway.\nHow in Norway they use it E. B. In general promotion, but this is what we will look like.\n00:21:16 SPK_5\nIn Norway in general, in order to honor waste, they are importing it because they recycle it,\nsweet, Eidun, recycling them and using it in other things, whether construction or E,\nmanufacturing is back other things because Take advantage of recycling.\n00:21:36 SPK_5\nSomething terrible.\n00:21:38 SPK_2\nBut, uh, the material sense, though, I mean, the materials, uh, the aggregates? I mean it has\nthe same money as the original I mean strong and\n00:21:52 SPK_5\nWhat's wrong with that? What is my advantage over recycling? Who? When you recycle it, can\nyou make it better than before?\n00:22:01 SPK_2\nBelieve it? What color does it mean? hahaha\n00:22:04 SPK_5\nYa Mo adds new materials that improve their quality and quality. Yes or you are the same\nmaterial a means their quality and quality accessories. Whoever finishes recycling it will not be\ndestroyed.\n00:22:17 SPK_2\nYes.\n00:22:19 SPK_5\nWhatever method is used in it means.\n00:22:24 SPK_2\nAh, L.E., I'm one of the things that I notice, and the question that happens in my mind these\n\ndays is that the traditional houses used to use a stone and the new ones are in the mind Easier\nto reuse and recycle any replay\n00:22:47 SPK_5\nRecycling means depending on the material you use, meaning what you use in this way.\nWhether cement e.\n00:22:55 SPK_2\nOr explicitly means their data. I think that it is permissible for me to insist on stone, it is\npermissible to drag that\n00:23:02 SPK_5\nNot.\n00:23:03 SPK_2\nNot. Sweet by.\n00:23:04 SPK_5\nThe material or technique you use for recycling is sweet, it will affect in general.\n00:23:11 SPK_2\nYoung people are welcome, hurray, hurray. Hi. What color are you doing? Thanks Sheno Hai\noil?\n00:23:21 SPK_2\nMay God bless you, peace, mercy and blessings of God. You have to hahaha Itches. Peace,\nmercy and blessings of God.\n00:23:31 SPK_2\n2000. and three, what do you think with you?\n00:23:38 SPK_5\n؟so\n00:23:38 SPK_2\nlook it's، one message may send me some مﺳﯾﻣ.

God willing. Thank God everything is good, everything is good.\n00:24:25 SPK_4\nSorry.\n00:24:27 SPK_2\nNo, but until I understand why I made the mio like Hechi for the new people, the idea is that we\nwill do a little bit in the beginning to stuff what is the project, what is the house of the ALA\nhopefully Each one expresses himself in a raped way, and then yes we will do The idea is that\none presents a project I mean he presents the project for recycling the rubble how can one use\nit for new construction, and say if anyone wants to talk about this topic that he is sitting here if\nsomeone else talks about the idea of whom, he has a second idea\n00:25:07 SPK_2\nHe wants to talk about solar energy, and we don't sit on this distinction, and then we let the\npeople who care about this project move who share each other, don't they settle? Relationships\nand. And this is the idea of the meosa hichi, and very happy and encouraged that if we see nice\nfaces and faces I mean hopefully like I tell people that I don't know anything that I am originally\nthis means my first week in Mosul, and I mean programmer and trainer, and I have a diploma\nABA different things, but I hopefully learn a hobby from you, and God willing you will benefit\nfrom The presence of some and what you see\n00:25:54 SPK_2\ncommunity much sustainability the community might؟ Horse hopefully and when?\n00:26:03 SPK_2\nHey he Any good one wants coffee? Yes, I've been 1/2 hour, and he wants to go get coffee.\nhahaha\n00:26:15 SPK_2\nNo, no. And let me see if it's okay. Everyone you have notebooks. He needs pens. I'll see if\nthey bring me pens and A.A.\n00:26:27 SPK_2\nPapers if something Hechi and we start, and people I mean on their mind on your mind afraid of\nit I have, there is no one here or there hahaha I Always when I remember I was in college and\nwho encourages me Bilal go sit for me in front of until you see Zain hahaha\n\n00:26:45 SPK_2\nEh, you are right. You came first thing to paint the one before thank God. Where did the people\nof the go?\n00:26:57 SPK_2\nSeating? We have papers, pens, or something, but I mean normal paper, iPhone, iPhone.\n00:27:18 SPK_2\nOh good? Kh wait a little bit after I mean every group of people.\n00:27:26 SPK_2\nOh good? We can appreciate whom. Min hissa means ah.\n00:27:32 SPK_2\nIf I try to meet people when they come and. I was stuffing on recycling, money, ah.\n00:27:45 SPK_2\nAggregates, aggregate materials, and where did you get to this project? I mean, yet?\n00:27:53 SPK_5\nI don't have a God-god project, but it's an idea.\n00:27:55 SPK_2\nIdeas of E. Yes.\n00:27:56 SPK_5\nAs an idea for Material Science M in general, but I didn't implement it, I mean this is an idea\nhopefully possible future.\n00:28:04 SPK_2\nIs it possible that you mean in training, there is a possibility for students to be able to use this\nidea and develop it, I mean get a trainer, right? right come and do it a duty hahaha\n00:28:16 SPK_5\nHahaha, it needs a good idea.\n00:28:19 SPK_2\nWhy? No? So you have ideas that come to implement, but you don't have the time, you have\nthe students, I mean, what is his name? Hiding and no sites?\n00:28:27 SPK_5\nIt's done? Hahaha, good idea\n\n00:28:30 SPK_2\nPraise be to God, what is the lesson of normal trainers, I mean.\n00:28:33 SPK_5\nWhat do you mean by teaching? I study A. I have two subjects that I study, parental chemistry,\nand E industrial chemistry.\n00:28:41 SPK_2\nIdentity.\n00:28:42 SPK_5\nHahaha. Industrial.\n00:28:43 SPK_2\nIndustrial E. Yes. Specialist E to Classes Two.\n00:28:47 SPK_5\nClasses E. You mean the Department or the AA Pharmacy?\n00:28:51 SPK_2\nPharmacist E. Hahaha. What color did the pharmacist have in the industrial A?\n00:28:58 SPK_5\nPharmacy is chemistry hahaha It is their chemical material.\n00:29:03 SPK_2\nDo you have college here soon?\n00:29:05 SPK_5\nIf the waterfalls in the falls, I can say as close as possible, I don't know not soon. Hahaha, it\ndoesn't mean you need if you need 20 minutes less to arrive.\n00:29:20 SPK_2\nE. Zain, what does his name mean? This means the idea is very sweet, and I want to follow it\nto see where you reach it, how can you apply it? Where did the idea start?\n00:29:32 SPK_5\nI mean, I don't know, did you ever see a video? Oh my concern was on rebuilding and building,\nsustainable I saw it I mean its applicators I mean nice layer worn out I mean hahaha good so I\nsaid I mean it is possible for one to take advantage of the topic I mean as a research or\napplication or layers Thank you.\n00:30:00 SPK_5\nSo we appreciate this topic that exploits or. Or even possible means is the idea. itself, which\n\nmeans recycling it means something else, for example?\n00:30:09 SPK_2\nAh.\n00:30:10 SPK_5\nSo we use it not necessarily in secret, and we use it can be non-material.\n00:30:15 SPK_2\nYes, definitely.\n00:30:17 SPK_5\nBut it should be as a complete research project, I mean a long study.\n00:30:22 SPK_2\nNot equal. Let's see. People from colleges will come hopefully, I mean there is a possibility that\nthere will be cooperation or people will find people supporting the idea Let's see if at least let us.\nPart 2\n00:00:00 SPK_1\nThese are practices, and also until they spread completely in the same way as they say in the\nlocal sector, I mean we want these friendly green practices to be the same. I mean, one of the\nleading construction methods at the professional level for the fourth director and the fifth director\nwill be mostly to work on modifying the framework, organizing and amending the regulations,\nwith regard to the fourth director.\n00:00:29 SPK_1\nAra and materials, Rah. This means, of course, that it will be in direct cooperation with the\nMinistry of Commerce. We'll look into the regulations. How can we improve it with regard to\nimporting materials, especially for example, environmentally friendly materials, how is our import\nfacilitated? How can we encourage companies to import them? And how could it be that us?\n00:00:49 SPK_1\nWe address the obstacles that currently exist, that is, with regard to the regulatory and legal\nframework for trade with regard to the dental sector, the fifth exit is related to investment, this is\nrelated to local, international and international investment in the housing sector in Iraq, this will\ncertainly be done in cooperation with the National Investment Committee. Certainly, it means\nthat it is an independent body, it is not a ministry, but it is an independent body within the Iraqi\ngovernment, and the regulations will be studied.\n00:01:24 SPK_1\n\nAnd also improve it if it needs improvement, and that also means even the existing capabilities\nwill be built, especially the employees who certainly work in this sector, investment even means\nNajib Hamin modern ways, for example, settle the automation of roads, investment, automation\nof applications, what investment is there in Iraq in order to facilitate the investment process?\nWhether internally, regionally or globally?\n00:01:54 SPK_1\nThis frankly means it was an overview that is what it means a summary of the project, I hope I\nam not long, I tried to be very brief, there are many details frankly related to this project, but\ntoday the session is related to a specific goal, what is it that we are working on at the\nInternational Trade Center, we are honored by your presence, today we hope that it means that\nthe session will be fruitful and we take from your count the ideas that we are trying to develop.\nCertainly, we will hopefully contribute to spreading these ideas and educating citizens about\nthese ideas, and therefore we hopefully see in the future, what does it mean that these\nsolutions, methods or trainings that we will work on are widespread in society.\n00:02:39 SPK_1\nAnd of course in the end we care about our Iraqi society, because this is our country and we\ncertainly try in the end to work something that benefits our country, thank you I mean thank you\nvery much for coming today, and oh I leave the space my colleague Bilal, yes so that he\ncompletes what he started\n00:02:56 SPK_2\nDad, if you believe him, agree a little, I mean if people have any question or any comment this\ntime, yes I mean hopefully will be with us the morning now, and yes Mr. Mustafa and Al-Hanaa\nand I am from the But now is the good time one wants to ask any question about the project?\nYes, go ahead?\n00:03:20 SPK_1\nYes? This is part of the project means.\n00:03:26 SPK_1\nIf people are frankly correct, this means that so far the selection policy for the water houses will\nbe built, this is first of all implemented by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme\n(UN-Habitat) and it has begun, and they are currently in direct contact with the Ministry of\nPlanning and the Governorate of Mosul. I occupied the first hopefully to decide the place,\nmeaning the location of this housing unit, and also according to the subject of the beneficiaries\nand the selection mechanism, because so far, eh? There is no clear mechanism for selecting\nbeneficiaries, but what do I expect in life they will be? It means ordinary citizens, I mean a\ncertain party, this is frankly what we know yet, I mean, it is being discussed, sorry, currently this\ntopic is being discussed.\n00:04:12 SPK_1\nWith the Ministry of Planning currently, but the 100 houses are part of the project, it means it\n\nwill be built before, I mean let's say free means the beneficiary of every sustainable building, a\ncomplete sustainable building I mean 100% currently Liwan Habitat also have communication.\nWith local and international specialists, to start working on the designs of these houses, sure\ndesigns will include the latest existing methods, whether honey, thermal insulation, solar energy.\n00:04:45 SPK_1\nWater conservation techniques, water return techniques, recycling and so on, this water is a\nhousing unit whose goal is not to address the housing sector in Iraq, we all know what it means,\naccording to the latest report of the ministry, the planning of Iraq in 2030. Three and 500,000\nhousing units, so frankly, when a project comes to build two hundred housing units, this is a\nhousing unit, it frankly means nothing compared to the need, but the idea is that we are building\na model, a ready and complete model for sustainable construction, enabling the Iraqi\ngovernment or even regional or international investment bodies to adopt the idea of the project.\n00:05:26 SPK_1\nIt will be expanded throughout Iraq, and will also be available to Iraqi citizens. At prices such as\nwhat he says are affordable either through non-profit installment systems, either through direct\nsupport from the government and so on, the idea is that we present a model and deal with the\nIraqi government to adopt it in a broader way.\n00:05:50 SPK_3\nIt will be their focus on job opportunities, right? I mean, a period of time for the number that the\nprogram remains in this four years is about the implementation mechanism, the money of the\nprogram?\n00:06:04 SPK_1\nHere we will talk about two jobs, there will be job opportunities, which will work within the\nproject, meaning job opportunities that will work directly on the project, whether on this housing\nunit, excuse me, the dead are housing units, or whether on these modern technologies and\nmethods that we will support part of them until Zain is installed or whether through the trainings\nthat we will give, and the process of and others so that the person is. We take these trainings\ncapable of working in this field, and also through the Decent Work Program, which is a program\nthat means the General Programme of Work that the ILO is currently working on, especially the\nhousing sector in Iraq.\n00:06:49 SPK_1\nThese are direct results, there will be direct employment opportunities as a result of the\nimplementation of the project, there will be indirect job opportunities, which can be generated as\na secondary or indirect result of the implementation. You can't limit a certain number of jobs that\ncan be generated by this project, for example, two hundred housing units that will be built, you\ncan generate 500 jobs, 400 jobs.\n00:07:18 SPK_3\nPreviously, in the moment of three years ago and every year mean. The same thing you're\n\ntalking about. We beat 1,500 young men and women, some of us from working, some of them\ntraining directly without a project.\n00:07:39 SPK_3\nPart was training in occupational threat. I don't know how to register?\n00:07:49 SPK_1\nAny training center.\n00:07:52 SPK_3\nWe also have numbers and documentation about the people who work, but this topic means\nwhat is easy it means. Big challenges, I did not say of success, hopefully they succeed in big\nchallenges and many details.\n00:08:08 SPK_1\nFrankly, this is the idea, the main idea of the project, and you know what it means that we are\nthe labor market in Iraq, which has many problems.\n00:08:17 SPK_3\nIslam Sector.\n00:08:19 SPK_1\nWhat?\n00:08:20 SPK_3\nToday, you, for example. For example, this nation's program included training for a thousand\nyears, working annually for four years 4000.\n00:08:35 SPK_3\nYou give them salaries, they come and come, they work, they answer in the morning, they\nagree with them from eight, which is two at 10:00.\n00:08:47 SPK_1\nThe materials that we are. This is the work that you talked about in terms of challenges in the\nfirst place.\n00:08:55 SPK_3\nSpecial training job, engineers, specialty engineers, youth, engineers, but even. He controls\nyoung people, and Abu Zikin learns.\n00:09:07 SPK_1\nYou are the idea, the idea of this topic, first of all, we will not provide training on a common and\nexisting job, the training that will target people will be on a specific field exactly, these trainings\nwill be for example in the field of solar energy in the field of thermal honey, these trainings will\n\nalso be. In partnership with local companies and international companies.\n00:09:32 SPK_1\nThese companies can also hold means give or give a certificate or document by the end of this\nprogram, in the end if a person is himself what he is interested to be part of this training or what\nhe is interested in creating a job for himself. We have to communicate with the community,\ncommunicate this idea, target the right people, whether they are engineers, entrepreneurs,\nworkers, skilled, the training will be on-site training, it will be in more than one place.\n00:10:04 SPK_3\nAccount.\n00:10:05 SPK_1\nProblems.\n00:10:06 SPK_3\nWe sanctify.\n00:10:07 SPK_1\nWe are yes yes, you even prefer.\n00:10:09 SPK_3\nExperiment until you survive.\n00:10:10 SPK_1\nOf course.\n00:10:11 SPK_3\nEven sleeping? Yes, I mean from 2001.\n00:10:14 SPK_1\nand 20.\n00:10:15 SPK_3\nYes, I almost worked.\n00:10:18 SPK_1\nYes.\n00:10:19 SPK_3\nOn your youth of this project. Oh, so you're the clock?\n00:10:26 SPK_3\nForm of a person who will give you 10,000, all of them want to work now? 170, 12 mia.\n\n00:10:41 SPK_3\nAnd take advantage of the mistakes before you until it corrects the process.\n00:10:47 SPK_1\nMy colleague Hana. Can you intervene in this topic because. But I might like to add that my\ncolleagues Mustafa and Bilal can talk about the Bayt project, which is a new project after Hessa\nat the beginning after we had the initial plans for the project, but the International Trade Center\nis not new to Iraq, not new to work in Mosul specifically, yes, we are from the year 2020 we are\nworking on a net project, if we hear about it.\n00:11:17 SPK_1\nAgricultural Value Chain Support Project, here we support value chains related to the housing\nsector, but in Sami Salasel Project, Agricultural Value has supported and trained a large number\nof young farmers, agricultural entrepreneurs, we have previous experience in implementation,\nespecially working with young people, we are only working with young people. On agricultural\nentrepreneurship, we have trained to date more than 4,500 young people, these are the\nchallenges that you mentioned, especially the lack of commitment to training, ALLA registration\nfor trainings for the financial grant, not and not for the training itself, this is us\n00:12:02 SPK_1\nAll topics and challenges that we take into consideration, and frankly from the topics that\ninterest us, something different can settle the ITC, its training is not paid, I mean its training, the\ngoal is then to create jobs, and the goal is to target interested people. Our goal today is to\ncreate trained young people who can get more jobs than our goal, we say that we have trained\nfor 500 months, or we have trained a young dead man, the goal is to create opportunities,\nsustainable job opportunities for the housing sector more than what they will be.\n00:12:44 SPK_1\nTraining only, and Bilal can raise the topic.\n00:12:47 SPK_2\nYes, I mean, if one of the things is part of the A. To train whom? It's faster to show you the idea\nof training that I started thinking about and taking suggestions I swear from you if I am from the\npeople how will he start I will put things on the ah on the customer One of the most important\nthings is that we learn from the problems that people live and know commitment is one of the\nmost important things But when we want to talk about people who are not going but learning\ntechnical things we are\n00:13:19 SPK_2\nAt the same time, we want to open new job opportunities, with a new opening, I mean.\nCreativity, and this is one of the things that I am very encouraged to hear creative ideas, and\nvery nice of the characters that are there, so that we can collect these things that we put in\ntraining, so that one is aware that there is a possibility that we can use the\n\n00:13:45 SPK_2\nThe rubble so that we make new buildings with benefits I mean it is not better than it was\nbefore, this thing is creative, and this is one of the things that I mean I like to see very much I\nmean in this project Kuwait It's not just that we go and learn from the best things from abroad,\nwe have a deep history and a big science in this room in Mosul, Iraq, we can benefit from it,\neven, I mean first let us come to I mean a hobby hahaha yes reasons that are useful I mean yes\nthere is no We will not have to pay for the things that we manufacture more, and the energy,\nscience and experience will all be there, the problem is calling Mohammed, come I mean the\n00:14:30 SPK_2\nThings not only technology not only things that we will want to open oh yes I mean yes I mean\nguys But young men and women are the ones who open the young women to other people\n00:14:43 SPK_4\nGod willing.\n00:14:44 SPK_2\nSo for me, this means that the project is big, and it has technical things, and it has educational\nthings, and it has things that mean practical at the same time, yes we try to do uh training so\nthat it opens the eyes to the problem, and opens creative ideas, even to establish new\ncompanies, yes, go ahead.\n00:15:06 SPK_1\nhahaha Mustafa. Yes.\n00:15:14 SPK_1\nIt's what I am, the box is gone. Yes, he will specialize in any citizens who can continue to like to\nadopt these technologies. He can do it, for example, until he wants, he will go, what will this be\nin certain areas, perfectly, I mean, for example, you know, for example, the city of Mosul is\nbigger than Hayes Tammam? For example, we will choose certain neighborhoods\n00:15:46 SPK_1\nAnd four districts Zain, and certainly we will make an announcement at the community level\nwithin these standards, it will be announced that, for example, the International Trade Center\nhas such a project, these technologies that exist, these technologies of course will be ready with\nfull costs, including installation, maintenance, warranty, and so on. For example, a given, this is\nthe, for example, solar energy, this vegetable is such an amper.\n00:16:18 SPK_1\nThis is its price, for example, and the International Trade Center subsidizes, for example, 30, 35\nor 40%, for example, the citizen who wants to offer or for example participates in this thing\ncompletely? Of course there will be a specific selection mechanism, okay? Therefore, we will\ncontribute to this project, this neighborhood, for example, means that we will not be able to\n\ndetermine the times. And until now the A means?\n00:16:48 SPK_1\nWe didn't specify the selection mechanism, but there will be determining the mechanism, the\nselection of neighborhoods, and the mechanism for selecting beneficiaries, in the end we will\nnot bear the full costs, we will choose a certain number of citizens as a down payment that we\nforgot with a certain part of this in order to encourage it, you know I mean in the end we are\nspecific to Iraq that I can't do a certain technology, so I'm not sure that this technology is 100%\neffective, because what Frankly, frankly, especially a new topic in Iraq, such as the issue of solar\nenergy, if I see my neighbors leveled and working with him perfectly? He doesn't have many\nproblems, I'm afraid, I'm going to hesitate.\n00:17:29 SPK_1\nThis support will be based on the principle of encouragement, perfectly, until we complete these\nsolutions, but I will be a mechanism for selecting beneficiaries automatically, choosing the areas\nthat are among the objectives of the project, but so far after we have decided on them, I mean\nthe project has been three months since it started explicitly, but this is one of the goals of the\nproject for your convenience, go ahead.\n00:17:49 SPK_2\nProfessor from the first?\n00:17:53 SPK_4\nPeace be upon you. Did you see you flipped over talking about a chain on it?\n00:17:59 SPK_1\nThis is a series about housing.\n00:18:03 SPK_4\nYes, this topic is very, very, very wonderful.\n00:18:07 SPK_1\nand new.\n00:18:08 SPK_4\nOn Iraq, it works this way. If we wish to work on this project through the value chain we\nachieved in the right way, you will see a great individual for all the projects that were established\nbefore it, but your advice.\n00:18:32 SPK_4\nValue. Just I mean internal matters within the organization, yes, I mean, you are working on 66,\nyou will only work within the project?\n00:18:48 SPK_4\n\nThe value network connects you to the processes within the project and the external\nenvironment, the external environment. This topic is very important, because if you continue this\nway, this is a successful thing, and you will notice a certain progress, but your progress will be\npartial, if you rely on the value network, this value network in the subject of management, the\ntalk is very yes now the countries of the world are starting to work\n00:19:19 SPK_4\nThere are some shortcomings that is the relationship of the organization. We are very serious\nabout work organizations when they are affected by the external environment.\n00:19:29 SPK_4\nBecause the external environment, we are not integrated with shortcomings, and the minds\nalways come from the external environment, even if you are an organization, the organization of\nchallenges will come from the external environment, so I wish this observation. As long as you\nare in the process of starting, we create the value that is the chain that you are talking about\nthat means within it what you want.\n00:19:55 SPK_2\nMean what. When we reach the stage of each feature there will be an idea? Big.\n00:20:08 SPK_4\nI mean, adopt it? A difference in success?\n00:20:13 SPK_1\nFrankly, we mean the goal. We excluded from the existing expertise, frankly this principle that\nwe have worked on is in projects.\n00:20:24 SPK_1\nIt is the part that cuts into the chains involved, this series can start from the let's say its\nbeginning is its beginning to some extent. He's gone.\n00:20:35 SPK_4\nCertainly increasing.\n00:20:36 SPK_1\nOf course, the internal must divide each unit into a connected network and what it means. A\nspecific system is internal for each unit.\n00:20:49 SPK_4\nLike you, it's a street network, okay, you want to go out? So we want to try to link the project to\nits environment? Sure, sure, sure that's it.\n00:21:06 SPK_1\nTo save time, I mean until I answer you on this topic. This means hi value chain, if you notice is\n\nthere.\n00:21:15 SPK_1\nI mean Ako. This is related to the internal and external business environment, I am one of the\noutputs of the project that made him happy, I do not know if you were present at the beginning\nof the ah,\n00:21:28 SPK_1\nWhich is we will work. With the Ministry of Commerce and the National Investment Commission\non the draft amendment that is, for example, we say the regulations and laws that are the\nso-called Al-Bolsi, meaning trade interrupted housing, this is something external and also\ninternal, perfectly, the investment in housing plots is also external and internal, so some aspects\nare frankly external we take them into consideration.\n00:21:57 SPK_4\nDear Sir. Yes. And laws, legislations and legislations of ministries such as the environment, all\n00:22:05 SPK_1\nA ministry that has sharia.\n00:22:09 SPK_4\nThe state and so on, right, here you must be.\n00:22:12 SPK_1\nand municipal.\n00:22:14 SPK_4\nYou know, you value chain is competent in productive production. The organization is very\ngood, I mean I am happy to see that you adopt such an idea, but if you expand it is better.\n00:22:33 SPK_4\nSome kind of compactness?\n00:22:34 SPK_1\nWe are currently taking the talks that we are not only taking with the Ministry of Reconstruction\nand Islam, the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environment, the\nMinistry of Labor, and even the Ministry of Industry, meaning the Ministry of Industry is part of\nthis project. We want to try as much as possible to study all the regulations in all ministries, even\nthose who work on one side, trying to make El Gouna abundant, but thanks for the feedback.\n00:23:02 SPK_4\nI mean, this is one we leave aside, we come to talk about the work environment, yes, one of the\ngoals of the project is to achieve.\n\n00:23:09 SPK_1\nImprove hundreds of ages.\n00:23:10 SPK_4\nHe is entitled to achieve a skilled workforce by working for the enterprise. Over time, we have\nhad a lot of experience on this subject.\n00:23:22 SPK_4\nTo come to an organization that embraces the support of the working class means as a model\nthat fully supports it, it has met with a kind of failure, because here you the worker will lose\nmotivation and will only become his goal. Get the money.\n00:23:40 SPK_1\nCorrect?\n00:23:41 SPK_4\nAnd that Tigi is organized. And you try to train the young people without any incentive\nsubsidies, incentives also meet failure and you will have the least failure, yes you see if you\nwant to give you thousands, yes this has become a feud.\n00:24:06 SPK_4\nLet's say complete emotion within the youth of the society, I have a delegation of Hess. He's\nlooking for a job just looking, I mean, he's trying to get any straw without thinking, it's going to be\nhis lifestyle, one day, if he does a certain profession of scarab, a construction blacksmith or\nanything, that's it. What stage is retirement? He will be this, this he said forget, this is it.\n00:24:39 SPK_4\nAs is the case with young people, it is the search for a job with the government, and it is\nshaken, and what may have become a serious current, what is possible. The regulation\nstimulates the youth in the direction of the private sector with the same thing, this means that\nyou receive an attack without thinking, they come and confront, it seems that there is no\nincentive or such, and the profession that you will bring to her and her chosen one is just in time\nuntil he advances think that he\n00:25:09 SPK_4\nYou'll come to you. You're the one who's going to meet you, why fail? Because you will get tired\nwith people who don't have, I mean the our youth today. I'm thinking 20 forever, excuse me.\nExcept. Except for every rule, there are exceptions.\n00:25:27 SPK_4\nThe thought inside him wants to be appointed. This is a pathological condition, worse than a\ncancerous condition.\n00:25:38 SPK_4\n\nHahaha, Zain, we have reached this situation, the process of fixing this issue is a process, but\ngradually awareness until this situation is fixed is the will of the situation program. It's a big\nproblem, we know, we're facing the new contracts, this is a degree and 17,000 degrees, we see\nthe wonder, is the one who comes to keep imagining that non-permanence is an acquired right,\nnot working together, we tell him that they exceed two or three days and they get upset, how will\nyou work in an environment like this?\n00:26:19 SPK_4\nExplain to me on Hessian I try to hear from you so that we evacuate some kind of controls and\nincentives that let the young man from the beginning. These are our 123 conditions committed\nto education, committed to pal.\n00:26:35 SPK_4\nIf the people of the means agree, you will agree to steal others. We must show these things\nbefore we start getting involved with young people. He is what. What conscious what.\n00:26:50 SPK_1\nCorrect. Shuwa Mo.\n00:26:52 SPK_4\nThey are guilty, but that means the state of the country is ours.\n00:26:55 SPK_1\nMy colleague here can tell her before grilling the topic of commitment. In the end, it is a\npersonal subject. Occupy someone who pledged to you at the beginning.\n00:27:02 SPK_3\nDid you handle money from the credit?\n00:27:03 SPK_1\nExactly, he will commit and come, and this is what he is subject, in the end, this is his personal\ndecision, we are the ones who are trying to present this project, even the trainings that we will\ntry to do with this project are new trainings in the arena, I mean, Mako, for example, I will give a\ncertain training, what I tell you is what happened in Iraq is not permissible, it is not permissible,\nbut it means in very areas, meaning b. with a little hesitation. And with a small prevalence, I\nmean this training that we will measure, vocational training or training means.\n00:27:32 SPK_1\nShame on these topics that we will choose, we will find people interested in these topics\nbecause these topics are the future, so we are the ones who will provide training or do\nvocational training in certain areas related to the sustainable construction sector that enters this\ntraining, he will have a minimum idea that it is possible in the future to work, and this new sector\nwhich is honestly some countries I mean currently it is the main concern of I mean now for\nexample the simplest thing is that we are the countries that are in our line Jordan Or for\n\nexample Lebanon after. What has become of them, Lebanon means the number of the. I mean,\nthe houses that have installed solar energy systems from 2019 until now exceed 200,000\nhomes.\n00:28:13 SPK_4\nOf course, ok, I am nothing.\n00:28:17 SPK_1\nThis is.\n00:28:17 SPK_4\nI have nothing else.\n00:28:18 SPK_1\nYes. You don't deserve, listen.\n00:28:20 SPK_4\nLet me.\n00:28:21 SPK_1\nAsk, go ahead.\n00:28:24 SPK_4\nSunshade, I want to hire it.\n00:28:27 SPK_1\nThe end is not also happening. The goal is not only to get electricity from personal energy.\n00:28:32 SPK_4\nYes, in cells, but don't be that thing. You do a specific design, we are close to these things there\nare studies that we can provide us.\n00:28:45 SPK_4\nSustainable homes must design us yes, a special way, solar reality, check insulation before\nelectricity, if.\n00:28:52 SPK_1\nYou allow me, so you will have a contest. A design competition within this program will be at the\nlevel of Mosul, we will ask applicants for this competition to submit specific designs in which\nthree designs will be selected, very good project.\n00:29:15 SPK_4\nYes, I hope.\n\n00:29:18 SPK_1\nOverall design, this will not.\n00:29:19 SPK_4\nPardon, no. One house?\n00:29:24 SPK_1\nWhat do you mean? But who completed complexes? I mean, could it be possible?\n00:29:29 SPK_4\nBe?\n00:29:31 SPK_1\nProjects? For now.\n00:29:34 SPK_1\nI mean the cost of the electricity bill is allocated if the house? Direct solar energy system.\n00:29:46 SPK_1\nWhat pays national electricity charges, I mean, he has a sex system that worked on this return.\nenergy, and you take it originally possible in return for mean?\n00:29:58 SPK_1\nCurrently, designs will be on buildings. It won't be for the rebuilt, maybe it's just, but on the\ncurrent situation I mean I don't know what it means.\n00:30:11 SPK_1\nYes, for the time I mean. We get out of the main discussion topic to go.\n00:30:20 SPK_2\nThe main competition is very important in.\n00:30:21 SPK_1\nThe issue of the fund that you mentioned and the issue of the dead house yes in 100% you are\ngone, I mean you install solar panels, sure, sure this means that it can be one of the most\nimportant syndicates, there are some things that mean. Ah, technically, I mean, from economic\njustice, there are technical things that are transformed, I mean, you don't just enter the, uh, you\nenter the system, uh, to reduce the cost of the bill, yes?\n00:30:53 SPK_1\nA technical issue that has an impact on the system, it is necessary to consult the electricity\ncircuits, which are I mean there are certain percentages that can Local experts and international\nspecialists were born in it, the Ministry of Electricity, and the Ministry of Environment in particular\nwill be part of the design committee on these two dead, a house, I mean, for your information,\n\nthere is the electricity law now, it will enact the draft, it doesn't have specific percentages, you\nshould see it before, no, this is the law, I mean if after it no no, it is still in the process of a draft, I\nmean a draft exists, yes until you see the percentages in which you can prepare solar energy\n00:31:40 SPK_1\nI mean, there is Ako. All the houses are in the area, can you install only 20% of your homes?\n00:31:53 SPK_1\nWhat is this? In case he Spring, you have a decrease, a decrease in consumption, an increase\nin production, where will production return? The production is due to trying with us, are we\nelectricity trouble?\n00:32:09 SPK_1\nNo, no, in certain seasons the production increases, and therefore the tilapia converter pleads\non the tilapia and returns, if the power is earlier than the decisions. Can you hack the\ntransformer?\n00:32:28 SPK_2\nI encourage that time will become that every dead person will become with Professor hopefully,\nDr. Hatkon hopefully money and money electricity, because he has knowledge and experience\nvery big energy.\n00:32:43 SPK_1\nSolar.\n00:32:44 SPK_2\nI mean, solar, this, the. This is solar energy, but we will reach it, but I noticed that we did not\nhear anything very important, is it permissible to mean that I or the first thing people will know\nthat he is an Arab who comes a little weak, so let me just explain why? And I say, I mean,\napologize from you, and I say you help me if you see it, it means what words have you\nreceived? I do not. I don't need help, I want to learn corruption, I'm Bilal, I want to work with the,\nuh, my grandfather is from Sulaymaniyah, but I'm raised, and I grew up in Michigan in America,\nand my mother and father meet in Baghdad. Thank God, I mean they insisted that here at home\nthere must be an Arab, but we didn't talk about the recycling, we didn't talk about\n00:33:28 SPK_2\nElectricity, we stuffed it means eating the kitchen and studying, and I don't know what it is, so\nwhen you see, you don't have toy, I mean, where are your words? Tony, new words, I need\nthem, will you write them down and try to memorize them well? It is. It's me. And this apology is\nQusay al-Saghir, but we didn't do anything very important I don't know all the people in the room\nnow I started to get to know people, and maybe the rest of the people I don't know, they know\nthat unfortunately Dr. E doctor\n00:33:53 SPK_1\n\nFiras.\n00:33:53 SPK_2\nDr. Firas has a very deep knowledge of electricity and soler, and he knows all the numbers he\nknows. Things I mean from the government coming and from the application and. I mean very,\nvery, I mean yes if one wants to know more about the and benefit that it is not useful where is it\nuseful we stuffed it in the beginning I mean.\n00:34:11 SPK_2\nWhere is B.B. in Iraq? In Mosul? Dr. Firas Firas, and this house so let each one introduce\nhimself in a short sentence, and then we continue I know that they were in the questions A, I am\nBilal I have electronics and programming and training And these days I want to work with the in\nthis project, what is the money for training, what is the project, I mean a very small part with the\nproject, but thank God I was able to go back to Iraq and see good people and work with you,\nthis is what we get to know about me, if you want we can do a quick acquaintance\n00:34:52 SPK_1\nMe. A Firas Marwan I work as a senior chief engineer in the General Company for Electricity\nDistribution North, one of the formations of the Ministry of Electricity, I hold a doctorate in\nelectrical engineering.\n00:35:07 SPK_1\nYou're welcome. Competence of AAA distribution networks. I currently work in the coaching\ndepartment, champion.\n00:35:17 SPK_2\nI mean, why does he neglect it? If it matters to neglect it? It's not the idea of rotating in the\nname of the work. There is study, rotation and field.\n00:35:27 SPK_1\nAttention.\n00:35:28 SPK_2\nI mean the field of interest why do you want to mean why are you in the room today?\n00:35:32 SPK_1\nYes, how much in the field of sustainability, yes? The current subject of jurisdiction is.\n00:35:43 SPK_1\nRenewable energies means distributed renewable energy generation that achieves the least\nsystem losses. Sweet, thank you Dr. Mahmoud.\n00:35:59 SPK_1\nFrankly, I came with Dr. Firas, he nominated me that I had a long experience, the United\n\nNations unit worked on it. We worked on the tribes, work is work and this is the. It means to\nbenefit you, and to experiment with the thief.\n00:36:17 SPK_2\nNice.\n00:36:32 SPK_3\nThe session was a very interesting title.\n00:36:36 SPK_1\nF. The meeting and I see them, and very.\n00:36:47 SPK_1\nF.A., Engineer Engineer. I'm working on a project.\n00:36:54 SPK_1\nAh, a specialist in heritage e-mail restoration, and.\n00:36:58 SPK_2\nThis project interests me with the project of.\n00:37:01 SPK_1\nThe archaeological areas on which he works are new, and the isolation materials and the\nbenefit of its use in.\n00:37:13 SPK_2\nThank you. Your name. Forgot the age of the dish?\n00:37:25 SPK_1\nMe?\n00:37:30 SPK_3\nHazem, forgetting about a doctorate. and head of department.\n00:37:37 SPK_3\nNorthern Technical University. Branches.\n00:37:42 SPK_3\nThe other branch that is as a very name with our topic today is architectural conservation. The\nfirst branch is a project in Iraq.\n00:37:55 SPK_3\nAcademic. Next year will be hopefully.\n\n00:37:59 SPK_1\nThe first stage.\n00:38:00 SPK_3\nThe first stage of specialization therefore means eh? It is very possible that the Political\nTobacco College will be a key partner after the project. Whether in the subject of job\nopportunities, any request participate.\n00:38:20 SPK_3\nhopefully with the same theme means architectural and sustainable conservation.\n00:38:25 SPK_1\nExcuse me, professor of the department, what is his name?\n00:38:26 SPK_3\nKeep?\n00:38:29 SPK_1\nWithin the Technical University, if he wishes.\n00:38:31 SPK_3\nGod. Also, I worked with.\n00:38:39 SPK_3\nEng. Heritage.\n00:38:45 SPK_3\nAnd. So this theme is architectural conservation, also is invited to the week, there means aye.\n00:38:52 SPK_3\nNorthern Technology Collector. Participation of specialists also AAA foreign universities. God\nwilling, from the coming days, there will be a ah on the subscriber, and we are honored by your\ncar.\n00:39:09 SPK_3\nAnytime they like, I try.\n00:39:11 SPK_1\nThank you very much, Mr. Mustafa Thaer. Specialized in solar energy.\n00:39:19 SPK_1\nPreviously. The industry nationality at the University of Video AAA is generally interested in\nclimate law and value, the impact is sustainable construction on the environment and society,\nand the economy economy. I wanted to see ideas.\n\n00:39:43 SPK_1\nFatima Ayalhom fiscal year, the most important institution of Iraq, is mainly the preservation of\nKoura jackets and shells on the heritage is the receipt. Interested in economic development and\nalways means anything related to the economy from a point of view. By God, he is an engineer.\n00:40:11 SPK_4\nApproval. Strategic, and one of the top 32 priorities is the issue of collisions, about if he wants.\n00:40:24 SPK_1\nGod. Engineer Akoza, numbers, numbers, numbers on the button\n00:40:31 SPK_1\nThe engineer, more roads than roads, oh the administrative work, and he is adjusting what is in\nthe stories of the entrances to cities, the fact that we have a lot of water in our garden in my tent\nin changing the fears of materials, More environmentally friendly,\n00:41:09 SPK_1\nThe head of the human resources department in the organization in this uh means of course\nthere is a defect in this session, within our work, how do I talk to Mr. Bilal on this subject? Part of\nour on-the-course training work. He is a collaborator, free, local organization.\n00:41:47 SPK_1\nInterested in sustainable design boundaries? Mohamed Khalid Ah, Executive Director. Ah, we\nworked in solar energy in residential agriculture, and, uh.\n00:42:05 SPK_1\nThe streets, uh, we have several contracts with almost 30 local and international organizations,\nwe went back to about eight state departments inside Nineveh, and we worked with them in the\nfield of solar energy, we already worked with the private sector, the field of laboratories. Eh, one\nof the factories we bought the Baghdad factory on, what was his ability, eh? Five megabytes,\neh? The largest project in Iraq? So far? Outlet in terms of total power capacity?\n00:42:34 SPK_3\nSolar.\n00:42:35 SPK_1\nAnd what? And also our specialization in the field of precision agriculture.\n00:42:40 SPK_3\nAnd a residential specialty, they are back to it.\n00:42:43 SPK_1\nConsulting, no longer organizations.\n\n00:42:45 SPK_3\nLocal International.\n00:42:46 SPK_1\nEh in the field? Behold, let the symptoms and your brother on myself, and let her remember\nand Muhammad, we mentioned a little of the problems related to the awareness of young\npeople, I am Hana Al-Hassan, coordinator of youth programs at the International Trade Center.\n00:43:03 SPK_1\nI have a successful model here. Hahaha. Ago. A few years ago I was working illegally, and\nMohammed was one of the projects participating in the accelerator programs from one of the\ndistinguished projects, something that makes me happy is that after this project finished\nMohammed more than three years, Mohammed is still working on a project that is expanding\nand was able to create job opportunities for the youth of Mosul, and today it is a successful\nproject and model, so we are the projects honestly\n00:43:35 SPK_1\nAnd those are these works that Thank you.\n00:43:38 SPK_3\nVery much.\n00:43:39 SPK_1\nHahaha. In the end, my name is Mustafa Al-Musleh, and I am the coordinator of the Bayt\nproject, which we explained before also in an international trade center.\n00:43:54 SPK_1\nWhat is the color feminist recycling of waste, and what is the color is surrounded by the micro.\n00:44:02 SPK_2\nThis network means I will try to mean. I do it everyone will suggest an idea, we are the\nsubsidies we will write here the new ideas\n00:44:15 SPK_2\nAnd organizations, I mean even we will see we will see who is in the room we will see the ideas\nin the room and yes yes sure yes let us oh oh enough the talk was nice if people have any\nsuggestions and they have yes I mean yes they see that there is a problem with yes With the\nsupport of one who supports one so that he trains quickly and problematically\n00:44:40 SPK_2\nWe talk about it, so I'm going to do training, and this topic today is about training, oh anyone\nhave any idea about one shilling? This is the problem of support and its impact on aaaa,\nmeaning that people come on time and continue with the project and the support has not ended,\n\nand oh young people, Hai Hai means it is not a problem that we stuff anyone, he wants to\ncontinue on this one.\n00:45:05 SPK_3\nI've got an addendum.\n00:45:05 SPK_1\nNever mind. With physical exceptions, with any other exceptions.\n00:45:14 SPK_3\nFirst thing we're working on.\n00:45:17 SPK_1\nThe trainee this is the first important step we will get for example the student or the trainee or\nwhatever he is one who is part of the work, our money, so we work on culture in the beginning, if\nthis culture we worked on it he will know all good we are and the secret of the next step will\n00:45:37 SPK_2\nI mean, how if one works with the youth and culture, I mean? What do we do? A day or two\ndays, a week we talk about an income trip?\n00:45:47 SPK_1\nCertainly, if it is brief, if it is summarized with several simple content, there is not much,\nbecause we are dealing with the Mosul community, which means it is not strange.\n00:45:58 SPK_3\nFrom inside the city of Mansir, for example, for example, a sports organization, when everything\ncame up wide, for example, in this field, it means if we work on this field, there are many\nreasons, we and a questionnaire that I hear about.\n00:46:11 SPK_1\nSubject.\n00:46:16 SPK_2\nAh, go ahead.\n00:46:17 SPK_1\nI mean, for trainees, of course, programs that need trainees are of two types, eh? I mean, we\nevacuate a set of filters, including applying for the form, the form is manifold and has many\npoints through a number that if we respond correctly, we will start entering the interview stage.\nOne of our programs we interviewed more than 700 people interviewed person, person,\npersonal interview.\n00:46:50 SPK_1\n\nAh, I extracted from it 300 people on mod download the program with high efficiency and it.\nOne of the solutions to the problems of traffickers is personal interviews, so that you can see the\nform you need for the program.\n00:47:08 SPK_2\nRight, you choose cultures, I mean I heard one of the things that encouraged me every time. A\nlesson on solar paresthesia means they open up a field of 30.\n00:47:25 SPK_4\nThe more than.\n00:47:27 SPK_2\nI mean, not just a little, I mean how many people do you have to come to 30? What's the best\nhopefully was there?\n00:47:43 SPK_1\nI mean regarding the public hand, the labor force is always nine for money only, I mean, I mean\nnot that it comes on a cultural side or always keen on money, so we always even put this worker\nthrough the leader and super pfizer to increase the number regarding these stages you come It\nwill exist, you will target the owner of these groups that are like others\n00:48:17 SPK_1\nSo you target civil engineering graduates and take them you will have a big one to have a lot of\ncoming down from the house or Observers on Oman except for the labor force, which will be the\nmajority, this is only nine, but if they have to.\n00:48:36 SPK_1\nTheir entry will be regulated. They can walk the Devila Sea and film while working, imagine\ngoing out to expand weekly salaries, if a day is absent or the salary is withdrawn from it, their\ncommitment will be direct daily.\n00:49:01 SPK_1\nI think in I mean a space you should choose very good people who have high honor, and those\nwho may be able to promise businesses that are more happy in R&D Then you go down a little\nbit by little, these are the last ones I have a bad experience with them, which we call Bal.\n00:49:23 SPK_1\nPeople who have a need, those even eh? What are stable? I mean, for example, he could be in\nthe stage of displacement and beliefs or intellectually with a settled resident in the city, but he is\nstill not affiliated with any. For all the ideas of the city, its work and its economy, these people\nlook at the help, the incentive that the international air force that can take it, what nine go up,\nmeaning passion and belonging increase, but you need a balance between people who are like\nwhat Mustafa mentioned. Leaders, as good engineers, move on with their work, lengthen it, and\namong people from the middle, I mean these people can work with their hands, yes, but they\n\nhave passion, I mean they have stability and any training program needs awareness.\n00:50:09 SPK_2\nBig.\n00:50:10 SPK_1\nI mean, I didn't publish the. Rigid with 50 lines and I want people to give me your money is\ngood.\n00:50:18 SPK_2\nI don't need to upload the video, ya.\n00:50:19 SPK_1\nPeople I don't have to work in this sector. Whoever has an interest equals 123 who has an\ninterest works 123 in two dimensions, I look at a non-video, I say to them, guys, will you slow\ndown, you see these opportunities in the future.\n00:50:30 SPK_2\nFolks, I am aware of them and at that time, the people who will have interest, will have a soul,\nwhere will he go? It is permissible to mean we start with before we start with advertising, money,\ntraining or manager?\n00:50:43 SPK_1\nWhat does it mean that you can not after what I swear, what is important, but you are talking\nabout that you want to settle this understanding of people? What do you think? Yes\n00:50:51 SPK_2\nGoodbye?\n00:50:57 SPK_1\nPersons. Interested people are studying on this topic.\n00:51:33 SPK_2\nSo in English, we look for\n00:51:46 SPK_3\nPrincipled with this jurisdiction more than the same person.\n00:51:48 SPK_1\nWho stops you. They studied economics. Because most of the people we keep talking to and\ntalking to you, I was on average.\n00:52:02 SPK_3\nUnfortunately.\n\n00:52:03 SPK_1\nI was thinking about hiring, I didn't think I could benefit the future. It means a type of nation that\nhas passion or what it has means the spirit of work or this time, I just accept these four years or\nfive years ago and meet you in the appointment.\n00:52:35 SPK_1\nIn here.\n00:52:35 SPK_3\nNon.\n00:52:36 SPK_1\nSections can I today this word?\n00:52:39 SPK_3\nWhat does it mean to desire.\n00:52:40 SPK_1\nBy breathing and they have a passion for this desire I mean? Very agreed, but it is because of\nthis way our economy is an emerging economy, today there are jobs in the construction and\nconstruction sector, after three years there can be new intermittent jobs, sustainability, before\nthat, there were jobs, for example, in organizations, we see many of our colleagues were\nworking with us development institutions today they are entrepreneurs in companies, it is a\nchanging economy, we do not go to be a high school graduate.\n00:53:12 SPK_1\nHe does not have awareness, we are the ones who have become us, ten years can work, we\nare no longer aware of the economy, where will he go because of its shape, so how can one\ngraduate from high school? He knows which economies will grow the most, and which jobs will\nbe good. And do not ask 90% of the Iraqi economy is Inforlo, you form 10% of the data, what\nmakes sense is that it represents the economy because the Informa is what you know is not\naffected, so it is very difficult that one enters a college is or Mahtot who enters a college, and\nthen completes a career path with the same specialization, and is happy with our mistake, but\nthis means.\n00:53:50 SPK_2\nWhich has difficulty in training because it is training. that we need.\n00:53:55 SPK_2\nA technical pal means part of our technical and part of it, and I want to think about how the\ntraining can be done Oh what are these two?\n00:54:04 SPK_1\n\nYou have an advantage that the number of university graduates in Nineveh from the close\ndepartments, I mean for example you need people with electricity, you have electrical\ntechnology, you have electrical engineering, the University of Mosul has electrical capacity,\ntronic and communications, you have the nearby departments on mechatronics like The\ncomputer goes like a at the University of Nineveh.\n00:54:27 SPK_1\nAlso, APP received another hour of electronics engineering. Control, computer informatics and\nothers, a large number of graduates gives you this space that within these graduates you find,\nfor example, a group of people who have passion and orientation.\n00:54:44 SPK_2\nIs there a possibility, I mean? Training is precisely that it needs people who come from parts, I\nmean one from electricity, one from the I mean from the Englishman who knows what it means\nfrom all parts.\n00:55:00 SPK_1\nBecause it is work, I mean it needs an entity, for example, Muhammad Muhammad is one of\nthe successful B. sustainability and solar energy, but it is his academic specialization, it had\nnothing to do with engineering, Muhammad maybe. I raise an athlete through leaks through\nseveral trips, which were very difficult.\n00:55:20 SPK_3\nFrom 2000, and.\n00:55:22 SPK_1\nAnd 18 I started the 2000 phase, and then 21 I am almost continuous, but he took the and\nknew how to manage the resources that he has engineers and so he knew how to manage\nthem.\n00:55:35 SPK_2\nDoctor, yes, we finished the definition, but if you want a little so that people know who's new\nwith us, we get to know yourself a little bit and a.\n00:55:56 SPK_1\nWho was the subject?\n00:55:56 SPK_3\nCorrupt then? France is our focus on the same subject.\n00:56:07 SPK_1\nThe first topic, sustainability in.\n00:56:09 SPK_4\n\nLodging.\n00:56:14 SPK_3\nAnd then the university architecture that is a sustainable phrase is sustainability.\n00:56:20 SPK_1\nAnd.\n00:56:24 SPK_2\nThank you. Thank you for being here and we are so happy, it means we saw you again. Okay,\nis there yes, I want to think about starting with?\n00:56:41 SPK_2\nTables, but if you want to take five minutes ten.\n00:56:45 SPK_1\nMinutes.\n00:56:47 SPK_2\nA break, and then the idea is that they go back and each one means 5 minutes. Yes, very\nmuch, I mean in a simple way, don't complicate it, you don't need big presentations, but suggest\nwhat you want to stuff about sustainability and reconstruction.\n00:57:06 SPK_1\nEspecially in the field of training, what topics do you propose that can become trainings from\nmany?\n00:57:12 SPK_2\nI mean about the solar energy, if about training, I mean ventilation and insulation and verse I\nmean, complete talking about training and mean?\n00:57:25 SPK_2\nIf he settles it, if any of the topics we have talked about so far? Oh we go to the tables, and in\nthe end I want each table I mean he comes back to me with an idea paper and you will choose\none who shares what you learned from the tables hopefully this idea Oh thank you all thank you\nfor being here hopefully yes you learned about the project and got to know the people behind\nthe project from Mustafa, here and me and if you have any questions and if you want any\ncooperation for sure\n00:58:01 SPK_2\nWith us, oh and uh, see you in the brain this hopefully, and after 15 minutes at 12 hopefully, oh\nno at twelve and ten we come back and I'll start if you have slides come if they don't have slides\ncome Extend it to you hopefully, thank you.\n\n00:58:24 SPK_2\nThe name of God. I supposedly but I don't know anything, so I need you yes I mean. And then\nwe complete it from the things that are needed.\n00:58:55 SPK_2\nRoic 1,000,000,000. One of the thoughts, what you were was it protects from the.\n00:59:14 SPK_2\nI mean, people can? They will return.\n00:59:21 SPK_1\nDo they do it at home?\n00:59:24 SPK_2\nThey put things and then they go to maybe and make a council and see me. Why is it only my\nwork?\n00:59:40 SPK_2\nThis is the beginning of one of Now we started I mean we only have a month with them and the\nfirst thing.\n00:59:51 SPK_2\nEThe time. About.\n00:59:53 SPK_1\nWhat's up? I mean, there isn't? After the hardest is difficult.\n01:00:16 SPK_2\nCoffee?\n01:00:23 SPK_1\nO.\n01:00:25 SPK_2\nSidi. Straight and your friend, one your car.\n01:00:36 SPK_1\nAnd something like the.\n01:00:38 SPK_2\nHyderabad pointing.\n01:00:39 SPK_1\nWas that they perhaps we.\n\n01:00:39 SPK_2\nHave.\n01:00:41 SPK_1\nThis was.\n01:00:42 SPK_2\nWe have a group and all of them, where is the dozen?\nPart 3\n00:00:00 SPK_1\nAnd he left a little ah, this house now the tribe for a week, I don't know that I'm tracking, while\nthis philosophy that we are going back to here or the bayzin is, no, it's the house that is\ndesigned to live, to live, and that you can work in it, you can settle everything you communicate\nwith, its components with the people who come around you and with the owners of the circle.\n00:00:22 SPK_2\nThousands of years ago, Iraq was named Mesopotamia, they were interested in sustainable\nconstruction, ordinary, if even observed designs. These are sustainable.\n00:00:35 SPK_1\nIt is one of the means so we know is uh building sustainables requested if thousands of years,\na thousand years long exist. With this very hot weather, you go inside these buildings, the\ntemperature can be lower than outside, so that's it. This thing means that people know it, but the\nproblem is what color can we bring to the modern method of construction, what color? We can\nlearn from the past, but we use the modern things that the doctor will remove from them, I mean\nthe walls do not have to be a meter to be insulator, there is a request to use from.\n00:01:11 SPK_1\nThe insulating insulating IE gives the same as the insulating insulating buffer. But the idea\ncomes from the projects and we update it in this, it may be the Haykal not Haykal the\nframework, the framework, the training They see the past we learn from torture and try to learn\nhow we can renew it and let it come out of it projects grandmothers\n00:01:35 SPK_1\nThis is a start I suggested to you what I want to think about these days from my research, and\nthe way of uh training in this way is that they take this we call it ah In the mean, they read this\nand they don't go to the cities, they find a modern building, they look at it, they go to their house,\nthey look and compare it, so it means eh?\n\n00:02:08 SPK_1\nWhat do they feel about it? And then where is he? They take this training with education, what\ndoes it mean the beginning of cooking, I mean they make their house money, and they suggest\nfrom the past, they used to do this, we can do this to improve my house, so suddenly my work is\nnot far away, not that it is a neighbor's house, if we build something big And will they have\nanything we can do in a week or two weeks?\n00:02:38 SPK_1\nYes, they learn about history, they learn why it was beneficial to the environment and\nsustainability, and how they can apply something from it, so here it will be, and yes, I mean,\ncreativity, I mean, they deal from history until they renew, yes, they renew their house, and then\nwe can work on the rest of the parties from the Beit Mal project. And the money of aa?\n00:03:07 SPK_1\nOne of the things I need. Is it permissible to learn from Muhammad? If there are people who\nhave companies here? And the companies they have.\n00:03:19 SPK_1\nApplication means let's say think that here we need at home, this thing is simple means clear,\nvery all people know it. Excuse me, how do they apply it? And there are people who have the\nability and what is the question? Are you not in the companies that even know how to apply\nthem? The second thing, this thing I have to stuff with it here is paper.\n00:03:40 SPK_1\nIt's Ako, Ako Funding. Maybe.\n00:03:47 SPK_1\nThe creativity program is one that has cured, it is the walls like it. Did he grow up? But we need\nto be able to be at the same insulator, and I have an idea, but I want to know what a company\nequalizes, so this broadcast needs, I don't know if. We do it the country is the third thing what\nare these things that between the previous research, they came out that these are the important\nthings, and if we find any training like a spicy conductor they do the money that they stop doing\nso they mean something and dream and they have energy and he has three choices they find a\ncompany they apply and they mean\n00:04:28 SPK_1\nI mean, my work is going on eh? Or the third thing they throw in these fields.\n00:04:35 SPK_1\nI know that this exists, I need these two, I need to see where people are, I mean, they can stop\nwith these, we need a second place for the company, but until I tell you, and the last thing I have\nto settle is that I suggest that I suggest to you, the framework is that it is Ako, any training that\nmakes people see the past, support sustainability, and then go to the future. So that they\ndevelop ideas and present them.\n\n00:05:08 SPK_1\nBut what do you expect if one will work on sustainability in the industry? Mind old houses, new\nhouses and new construction? What do we need? Train people in this? But if you take a picture\nof her? If you say on the paper yes I mean this way you have ideas, if you please I mean if you\nwant to take your hand away, if you are going to suggest Bilal, you are going to do training on\nsustainable construction, you need to train This one.\n00:05:41 SPK_1\nSo they put it there, and your hand.\n00:05:46 SPK_2\nExactly, Bilal means explaining the general framework of training, which we imagine, for\nexample, we are thinkers in several fields, in many ways, you can help us, we are developing\nthis project, we are developing training curricula, and because the way the ITC works is\ndifferent, we will not answer, for example. Training curricula from a second country that we\ntranslate into Arabic and train and say that we are our path of salvation, because we want to\nwork on something that really creates job opportunities, so you can add us something, we are\nnot thinking about it, we can think about insulation by insulation with diesel.\n00:06:29 SPK_2\nIt could be something else, yes you will help us think about adding a new topic, we are still in\nthe field of developing training curricula, so we need to hear from you ideas suggestions, yes\nwhat does this sector need in the field of sustainability, it can create job opportunities for young\npeople, especially that we are starting in Mosul, we are going to start in Mosul, then we will\ntransfer the experience to other provinces, maybe after the first year of the project, so we would\nlike to hear from you And thank you for the way to your house, that if someone has an addition\nhe can now give us an addition or write us on the\n00:07:13 SPK_1\nI can, first of all, I see that you're talking about isolation and so on, and all of these I think\nprecede them at least two hours 3 maybe or a whole day to talk about the philosophy of\nconstruction, I mean these insulators, and everything is connected at a stage that the person\nneeds my son a housing unit, it could be me or a valley or one of the existing ones This is the\nphilosophy of construction for us, as normal people in this society, it is yes, what is distorted, so\nwe need to talk about the ideals of lighting.\n00:07:45 SPK_1\nThe philosophy of building green spaces by construction, even if the area is small today, Pal\nand other sites, the spaces are small, Baxica and others, Brazil as 100 m, but it is designed on\nNawaf, for example, logical green spaces, meaning even if small. Exactly, this is the philosophy\nof construction, which is like what comes in relation to a little bit of mentality that focuses on the\nsubject of mentality, that is, two dimensions of other things that may have something to do with\ndesigns in terms of designs, because the person who will go with a traditional design will adopt\n\nfrom the beginning a traditional way of thinking, in comparison.\n00:08:25 SPK_1\nBehold my neighbors except this heck this pain engineer is a swindler. Your father is my\nmother, this engineer is like that, from the beginning of the beginning, from the traditional, we\nwill want to innovate more with the issue of insulators, the issue of the 90's, there is something\nelse I can always think about, I mean that we are in winter. The bathrooms are our money, the\nvisas, everyone has and the micro remains in it, but the house can be inhabited by a small\nnumber of people who need the morning to go any take or surveyor according to their work and\nthe time remained this water is not used and at the same time we have a huge amount of\nmoney from the deaths of children and suffocation of the secret because of the talking sofas.\n00:09:12 SPK_1\nWhat is the possibility? That we think about going around her? This water using these\ntraditional heating methods both on the floor, Or what they call Kinzitia Ossia by it. What is like\nin Europe or elsewhere. And they are present and correct.\n00:09:27 SPK_1\nAnd this may not be intended to be created. They are jobs, because for example, you also see\nthat we are the sweetest energy consumption in our homes.\n00:09:37 SPK_1\nIt comes from refrigeration and air conditioning units and comes from various migration,\nwhether the victim or the third, the consumption of electrical energy in Iraq, and the winter\nseason is the heater, I have almost 30. At the time the card is also sold at a good price, because\nthere is a demand for it, and here is the energy I mean.\n00:09:59 SPK_2\nWe see most of the modern residential complexes that are really used I mean sustainable\ntechnologies, but we see that most of these go to butchers, Ghazia from the house that lives in\nit is invasive. I don't have boiling water when I turn on the water, the water is hot, and the water\nis burning all the time, meaning what time I need it.\n00:10:23 SPK_1\nI have Ghassan, I look at the umbrella, I mean Eli is a heater. The canal and mata are present\non the surface.\n00:10:31 SPK_1\nWorking means without electricity. Then don't? I mean, we lived the Turkish experience, which\nis in the country with little heating.\n00:10:42 SPK_1\nwith walls. It's all warm, it's very cold out. And at the same time you don't have hot. And what\nyou need is that it turns into fragmentation, my question here is my question, here from a\n\nsocietal perspective, I mean, Hessa you know each province is different, I mean, Hess, for\nexample, that I am a relative of the winter season in Duhok M, I cannot compare to Baghdad,\nwe are in Baghdad the winter season is two months that I turn on the heating for one month,\nyou do not have anything that you deserve, it is true frankly, and God means yes, I want to ask, I\nmean from a societal perspective, the winter season in Mosul?\n00:11:14 SPK_1\nIf I come to compare heating with cooling, I mean if we want to reduce the importance ratio of\nM or the ratio of cooling how much does it take percent and heating how much does it take\npercent Don't talk about the business, tell him from perspective Citizen, you now if you come as\na citizen What does he mean he says you want heating or cooling, and why the winter season in\nthe season how many months a month\n00:11:39 SPK_1\nI mean, what does the citizen complain about? Most of the things related to cooling, the heating\nis different, I can get a gas heater that is enough for me for three to four days, a reasonable\nprice and its heat energy is very high, okay if you wear it, but I will go to a solution, but if I do not\nhave electricity, what color? Colder? There is no accurate solution, I mean, not only these are\nfactors that you can settle in the room, it makes the room maintain its temperature, you defend\ne-mo like cooling, cooling, just what a child, you are all cooling. If you perform in it, you can\nmaintain it by brushing a carpent that makes certain arrangements.\n00:12:13 SPK_1\nIt doesn't mean just that the stairs go off, especially the second floor, talk about the floor, things\ngo well, but the second floor is not a limit, it is a problem, this is frankly, I mean, I am my dear\nteacher, if you allow me the topic of heating. What is spent on heating in the winter, and what is\nspent on cooling in the summer is almost balanced.\n00:12:38 SPK_1\nThe second point I'm in. In our continental atmosphere, and in particular we are talking about.\nOn the city of Mosul. Whoever is deaf can not rely on heating and neglect cooling, and I cannot\nrely on cooling, and I omit the repetition, and here completes the real problem that we have,\nmeaning if I do not have a hot atmosphere to adapt myself only to the atmosphere, and I do not\nhave a cold atmosphere to adapt myself to the cold atmosphere, this is what we are if we can a\nhouse that adopts heating and cooling at the same time.\n00:13:15 SPK_1\nCreativity. We have achieved innovation. The topic is not easy, it is not a matter of insulators,\nand the topic is over.\n00:13:25 SPK_1\nBecause in summer you need great ventilation, and in winter on the contrary, quite the\nopposite, you need. ELI Afori fuel with the category of gas and the word, you will have pollution\ninside the house, you too can not isolate in order to maintain this income, you need to rotate you\n\nneed, filters the subject, I mean somewhat dragging us to the eastern construction, which is\ngradually developed over thousands of years and is more accurate.\n00:14:00 SPK_1\nFrom the modern construction that does not have this consideration, now, yes, the\nconsiderations of isolation seemed to work, we returned, let's say in the sixties and seventies of\nthe last century, when the Iraqi man began to move from the old houses, which are the door of a\nheritage nature, he does not have a type, he sees the forest. From Europe whose windows are\nthree and four very wide supplies, the way the ventilation does not suit our society and does not\nsuit our atmosphere, because he was dazzled, he was fascinated by this nettle, you see that all\nthe people seemed to follow this the, eh? This approach, gradually people began to feel in the\nmind of the imposition Zain e, this talk I expect a.\n00:14:56 SPK_1\nIt's just to stay with us for an hour, and the people who didn't participate want to participate, so I\nexpect this idea is how we can learn from the past and the home industry, and all of them we\ncan sit designs and not designs designs, maybe this place designs, and what color affects the\nhouse, an issue that wants to participate The anniversary project that we talked about the open\nsource, this is an open source project called Shawarma with a project.\n00:15:24 SPK_1\nAnd this is any project that protects the water, but it rotates it head, cleans it and returns it, and\nyou wash it with clean warm water, so it does not cool down and does not go to the sewers, so it\nprotects a small water and comes to take, I mean, a shower as much as you want, hours and it\nrotates it, and this is an open source project that means that we can take it, develop it, and\nmake it local, and this project is money If there are many projects of money, it may benefit us\n00:15:55 SPK_1\nThen who wants to participate, but here is a note E. For the Mosul. A pregnancy we have\nreturned is different from Baghdad and the southern regions, Umbal southern Iraq, summer\npregnancy peak pregnancy is summer, while.\n00:16:18 SPK_1\nIn Mosul, the peak of the Shatbi pregnancy, the peak of pregnancy means almost 50% higher\nthan the wealth of the pharmacist pregnancy is 50% more, more than 50%. So the topic of the\nmeans it turns out to be a concentration concentrate like what the doctor prefers, prefer both of\nthem are required, but the most thing in the winter, because we see it as the hours of the\nprogrammed piece in winter more than hours, the programmed piece.\n00:16:50 SPK_1\nAll the oil in it means any job? Yes. Yes, I mentioned that it is winter.\n00:17:02 SPK_1\nPregnancy lasts two months. No, no, two months, we start to moderate the weather.\n\n00:17:09 SPK_1\nSince the month of Ah but when the police enter Mosul, what time do people want to operate\nthe ah you are the banquet when the middle of the morning do not wear it? 11111\n00:17:25 SPK_1\nWhen are you afraid to start running Mitterrand? This means that this is about three, but we can\ntake this as a word. I expect.\n00:17:39 SPK_1\nThe salvation of the sixth begins in them. The 25th, and the sympathy of what you will call this\nand the happiness of processing?\n00:17:49 SPK_1\nThis will triumph designs. Right, so let's gather here so we can stop it. About. on this topic.\n00:17:59 SPK_1\nI mean, I hear from people who want to, share the idea in front of them for 5 minutes. Go\nahead, doctor.\n00:18:08 SPK_1\nAh. Muhammad and then? Who wants after doubt. Go ahead, doctor.\n00:18:14 SPK_1\nI mean I bring a laptop color means the homeland like you said if she replied it comes in a free\nway It's all there, I have something to talk about.\n00:18:27 SPK_1\nEA notarized. Before the.\n00:18:32 SPK_1\nHouses, we were in the sixties and seventies, there was an important paragraph, it was the\ntemperatures, the temperature was different according to the global occasion due to climate\nchanges, today you are in the right place needs the cultivation of merchants I mean. Find out\nwhat the temperature is inside the houses.\n00:18:54 SPK_1\nGo to you, there was a big discussion about agriculture. It means bringing up many topics.\n00:19:02 SPK_1\nBut you are the problem currently in the island region that it is disappearing due to the intensity\nof the heat due to the lack of agriculture, it is a big part of the study, a big part of the solutions.\nYou are right, God forbid me to talk about construction, I mean in a practical way, for example,\nas a neighborhood that lives in a house, if every house planted has three signs within ten years.\n\n00:19:30 SPK_1\nMy eyes the answer is to provide the shade of this occasion, so sure this area is from the dead,\nand the temperature will definitely come down, it's the problem It's the gardens in the houses\nnow they are starting to fade, Mako originally, is the spaces of course Zain, Zain Fahsa? Once\nDr. Mohamed you want to say yes and then?\n00:19:53 SPK_1\nBut Basma Zein's intervention, the intervention, influence on training, the second plane.\nTraining, this is a doctor you want to share something?\n00:20:09 SPK_1\nSo maybe we do the training session and I signed with you with a delusion? Peace be upon\nyou, I mean we all the talk from our colleagues about the design and the heritage house, and\nhow was the heritage house, usually this is what is usually called negative climate,\n00:20:40 SPK_1\nThe first thing good or not good Majid answers us is what he knows that without dependence\non the or plus electric power, energy, gas, all kinds of energy, these are in the world they call it.\nin the old city.\n00:21:07 SPK_1\nThe old Arab city means the specifications of the lighthouse, it differs from all countries of the\nworld, means even silence regarding sustainability or sustainable design, we must put the\nenvironmental conditions of any country, we in Iraq have certain specifications of the climate\nremoved the present. The trains have little humidity, and for this there are certain characteristics\nthat characterized the regions in general, in Iraq, which are apples that are very hot in\ntemperature, variation in temperature, at the level of summer even during the day, I mean I have\nlike in summer.\n00:21:43 SPK_1\nTruffles, and the wind always comes to us. Lies, and this is one of the problems that we are\ncurrently using.\n00:21:53 SPK_1\nBut this is what he was using. What kind of bottle is it?\n00:22:03 SPK_1\nClassic types of course depending on the price. People in the old Arab city, Ashu dealt with this\ntopic until we said Ashno we design, I am always our students, I mean we lead their ghosts to\nsustainable architecture, one of the most famous we design sustainable architecture.\n00:22:21 SPK_1\nIf you design directly, you go to traditional architecture or what you drink. Folk architecture with\n\nfolk architecture is it sweet? These solutions were divided into two directions on urban planning\nand at the level of one building for urban planning, the main objective of which was to provide\nan urban shade, which means a promising one, why? Because in any area we provided we\nprovided temperature difference.\n00:22:50 SPK_1\nWe provided a difference in demand, and we do not have the current moving automatically\nwithout wattage. One of the things used was narrow alleys.\n00:23:05 SPK_1\nIn addition to the system, the system, this solidarity urban fabric, the houses were always\nknown as the Old City, meaning that the city of Mosul is not all a unit on the street, the less we\nreduce the number of facades exposed to solar radiation, the less heat that will enter the house,\nand therefore the more we are.\nPart 4\n00:00:00 SPK_1\nAn air current has become on the surface, so it automatically covers this surface without a\ncertain force. The second case I have. Elly is.\n00:00:12 SPK_1\nThey used building materials that were conductivity which is the stone of the chair or. Or the\nmattresses, which we have, of course we mention these specifications, we did not achieve them\nin our house now, but the issue of the thick, the money of the wall, was aimed at isolation. On\nabsorbing or servicing heat, and we started dispensing with it in line, of course I mean my\nstudies in France.\n00:00:39 SPK_1\nAnd a building material called which is Shlon does not mean that it has many gaps, the purpose\nof which is to reduce heat absorption. The walls are all the prophet. Any detail in any house, we\ncan use these inscriptions which are the. And this is usually found in Assyrian architecture, and\nthe erection of walls, we did a research means.\n00:01:01 SPK_1\nI mean, what do we apologize to the Assyrians, why once circular, once square, once\ndeductive, why? Why did we study? It? We discovered that for every detail, whether it is a\nprotrusion or any means bullets, inputs or sorties, it is an environmental impact, the subject\nmeans what is aesthetic, an aesthetic and environmental subject. About us structural materials\nknowledge.\n\n00:01:24 SPK_1\nThis mud, the talon of course, from the power of the clay bird, I didn't give them the materials,\nthe queue that currently comes from Turkey which is the good one from the red block, perfect, a\nhair perfect, a precious feeling, but I don't have to use it with all its walls for the house, Any\nconfrontation from the building, you will take more radiant, solar, I use this wall and only,\nbecause some times people's obstacles put on yourself and God is precious, no, expensive my\nbrother at the level of independence long is the roofs, the ceilings, currently they used domes\nand food for him in the roofing of buildings, why? If exposure to solar radiation is on one side\nmore than better than society.\n00:02:06 SPK_1\nWe are currently in our homes to their feet. People seemed defenseless. By letting the\ninsulation materials make thick, it wants to make blocks and bricks, which means that people\nhave become aware of this issue.\n00:02:23 SPK_1\nOn the other solutions that keep Ahmed Hariri, we had the little Saidi in the city, the city of\nMosul, they used comfort and pen, his temperature was always first, and now we mean a\nFrench back that looks like this house, the clock becomes on it as a result of the narrow space,\nthey want to go down like a meter two meters and raise this area. Why do we have a doctor?\nThis talk? I mean a lot of people are currently telling you by God.\n00:02:54 SPK_1\nThe space is weak and the wind is soaring, oh what means what provides me and provides me,\nand the old architecture, I do not want to use my house, to use, I mean there is a possibility of\ncourse what has been achieved to achieve all the elements, but I can achieve. Of these\nelements?\n00:03:14 SPK_1\nThe people of the arcades, this is the part that separated the code area from the rest of the\nspaces in this corridor, the purpose of which is to provide a shadow or a transitional phase, this\niwan is another element that exists, the entire house that is taking on a two-story agreement.\nYes?\n00:03:35 SPK_1\nConnected open Kurds its temperature, lower, sunball, cold, heat, difference, gray stream\nowner. And of course, in areas like Baghdad and other than what was in the details of Shanashi\nHai Shanashi had two jobs, an environmental function.\n00:03:55 SPK_1\nThese were considered wooden wood, victorious bricks of passing an air current through this\nwood generates, enters into space, in addition to the topics related to privacy because it\ninterrupts the communication between the inside, the inside and the outside. Exactly, we came\nto the second type of classifications of elements that are elements aimed at evacuating hot air,\n\nwhich is what is known as Iraq and Badiyat or what is called the wind position, there are two\ntypes, the wind position is between us and two holes or an opening in Iraq, we are usually\none-way.\n00:04:29 SPK_1\nThe liquid wind has the north, they were facing, but in other areas they call it the tower of the\nwind tower, this wind tower is or. Four directions, four directions, this is done to all the\ncircumambulation that exists.\n00:04:50 SPK_1\nIf it is available in the refrigerated coolers we are now using in our homes. It is a but you told\nme that we are not in their face in directions, we are in certain directions pulls the air and\npushes it is the same building, before this was directed in the direction of the wind, the goal of it\nis to enter air and descend, it was through the stream with nozzles, Manu they were evacuating\nit Mi Meen evacuate, Mai shows free air, who goes down? It comes to no, excuse me, I have an\nintroduction.\n00:05:27 SPK_1\nYes, this free air that comes down on these holes or basins of water money, so we would use it.\n00:05:36 SPK_2\nIt was only 5 minutes, we turned off the electricity, we didn't see the drivers, so they just came\nback. We haven't seen those, so we should see that it's very nice.\n00:05:47 SPK_2\nYes from us I expect a and a quick but so that we can I will take pictures for them hahaha yes.\n00:05:57 SPK_1\nI mean, these are the details for me. Elly. Call and Ako and Ako Ako Ako this L.A?\nPart 5\n00:00:01 SPK_1\nAnd the young man is working eh? The universal part of the church, descend on.\n00:00:05 SPK_2\nThe narrative between us is cold. This will make me feel like I swear to God the areas I use at\nhome, not by God.\n00:00:19 SPK_1\n\nThe air that comes from the Malaga. What comes from. Bottom.\n00:00:25 SPK_2\nAccording to the weather. Honey in the air, but we say Malaga Malaga in the wind, meaning\nlanguage pulls the wind from the prevailing direction, we have elements, the third type is\nelements aimed at humidifying the air Babylon, which are two types fountain.\n00:00:43 SPK_2\nTherefore, it is used from the inside, in addition to another element which is the salsame, this is\na salsabil is a traffic lot, and inside the space inside the code passes over it water, and as a\nresult of the heat it will moisten or increase the rights, and therefore we reduced the\ntemperature, I mean, I'm sorry for the prolongation.\n00:01:08 SPK_3\nI mean, yesterday and one of the things I wanted to share with the group about the form. Ako\nEh? I mean, can you?\n00:01:16 SPK_2\nBefore I talk about Czech, it's not me who told you about Karbala, I actually visited Karbala\nonce twice, I mean, even just friends were with me from studying, on a certain point. So far, it's\nthe same. Soul.\n00:01:34 SPK_2\nThe style is up to this precise, the same architectural style as the old one. The fact that these\nhouses have been vacated to these exact areas is the same as what has changed.\n00:01:46 SPK_2\nI mean even those who live with you yes they build themselves they bring it himself, this\nspontaneity of people, sports, I mean we love Hussein, I mean after two you come you know\nand go away. This means love for the place.\n00:02:06 SPK_2\nI mean, it was a strong motivation for sustainability?\n00:02:10 SPK_1\nPride in identity.\n00:02:13 SPK_2\nAnd what, and he had attempts, I mean, what? Attempts to demolish a house or a part to be\ndemolished means in a land that will work without guidance, people's actions are among them,\nmeaning community participation to rebuild this damage. Those who used to see Ako, for\nexample, declare that today we are clean, for example, the Hadra or the Hadra our father and\nour father ignited all the people blowing regardless of the degree, the educational level and the\ncultural level.\n\n00:02:43 SPK_2\nAll the people seemed to keep managing this issue, who were fundraising, the whole people\nwere involved, we were benefiting from. I mean from this experience. That we therefore mean\nlove of the place.\n00:02:58 SPK_2\nAnd the desire and desire in. An important and essential incentive in the sustainability of any\nproject or any amount, and that's why we are in Mosul, everything that happens to us means ah.\n00:03:13 SPK_2\nA meeting on the revival of heritage followed us from Jenna, and we may talk about heritage, I\nalways mean I am satisfied that by returning us a building we return according to the old style, I\nmean what we simulate them 100%, but at least we add an identity to it in order to preserve the\nEnglish Jayne, and we took advantage of Dr. Omar with a while ago. There was a project in\nBritain that was a research project on documenting tangible, and intangible heritage in the city\nof Mosul, which means what is the end of me. Who came from Britain and the British\ngovernment was on Tafan?\n00:03:50 SPK_2\nFor this project it is good from Britain, documenting a parallel heritage, tangible heritage,\ncalculated to have a child that is the one who comes. Baldossar Otem.\n00:04:03 SPK_2\nAnd people used to feed the aaa feed the atmosphere, and from Aji I miss and get the wind of\nfish, and then come to the thirsty, and this is what they want to declare sustainability for this, I\nmean, they study and what do they achieve receipt for now you have children, I mean, where\nare we?\n00:04:22 SPK_1\nI would like to add to you I mean in terms of words and good words and God bless them, but\nbefore ISIS entered, these trends were present and present among the people, not with the\nlocal government. The proof is that it is Dr. Mahmoud Al-Jalid, Mr. President of the University of\nMosul for Markets, may God have mercy on him, eh? He was? He asked me that he rum from\nthe house of eh? He is safe to deal with? The rest of the newspaper that you know that this\nhouse was influential in every detail, in two years, in all its details, from its basement to its\nrooms to their khanda, to the tunnel to eh? Strange architectural details, I think they are.\n00:05:03 SPK_2\nEspecially.\n00:05:03 SPK_1\nin Medina and Mosul. Is the street through this house that I knew through a certain deficiency\nthat comes down the atmosphere of the street comes out in the house eh? From the icy beds,\n\nanother house that is now a parking lot but was there.\n00:05:19 SPK_1\nFiras Emad. It's nice.\n00:05:21 SPK_2\nI mean, so far. He refuses.\n00:05:26 SPK_2\nThe only family that built its buildings now after ISIS is Beit al-Jalidi and Amron himself, I mean\nmy friend Sinan al-Jaliq who offered it. This is the age of all the Pashas, they did not roam an\norganization or a contractor, they did not roam with the stone, they collected the match and\nlooked like them, they roamed the people and under their supervision and began to drop a\nstone and returned the pulpit and people returned.\n00:05:56 SPK_2\nAnd they were interested in it. What I followed from the ice they built it himself and what they\ncame. No engineer?\n00:06:07 SPK_2\nAbu Shalal crime is your daughter's husband responsible for I mean for focusing affairs they\nrefer him himself expand to your field picture. The place and how we took, and among them the\nspecifications, lighting, and a good shilling with us?\n00:06:23 SPK_1\nWe entered Emil and after the liberation and prepared after it. Still this.\n00:06:27 SPK_2\nExplain.\n00:06:27 SPK_1\nPeople before the municipality they proceeded the municipality.\n00:06:31 SPK_2\nI mean, told? About us at the University of Mosul.\n00:06:37 SPK_2\nI mean, aaaa. We do not accept after we work in the world, and it works as we do, I mean when\na British from the houses you have.\n00:06:47 SPK_1\nOur own standards.\n00:06:48 SPK_2\n\nI want my own benchmarks Penny Why? Because my eyes must be private, and if we walk the\nworld in every country. Qatar. The Green Pyramid in Egypt.\n00:07:05 SPK_2\nfound in America. The first is done for the second, it's in France, I mean, we have to try to have\na special form in us, uh.\nPart 6\n00:00:00 SPK_1\nNour Salim, this is backward, and if he works in this way, it is what the house is beautiful, how?\nCan we compromise between our aesthetics and identity? Oh, I mean, compared to Elly Yjina,\nhanging from the West? I mean, now, if you follow these standards, your money and make an\niron house, it can cost me such a sum, people can come and criticize me, I mean.\n00:00:22 SPK_1\nThey went on. On Tunisia, Mr. Abdelsalah, Hai Ali Saleh, yes, crack who? Are you? Your\nhonor? Pocket two pictures, one of A. from Fez M, a picture of me a building, take me a modern\nbuilding, a house, and bring it down to the people, and present any between, believe me, they\nwill choose it as a heritage house. What Pete loved me, if it's on my feces.\n00:00:46 SPK_1\nI will be Bahaa, it is me, this is my intention anymore Bahaa who shows insurance you show\nclarification to people, dear you are the one who made the opening fragile will be fragile, I mean,\nwhere is Hessa? Citizen talking about the level of Mosul? He comes from any evil that may live\nin a house with monsters in it, which is this monster. We are the first step in the Emma Outreach\nProject.\n00:01:11 SPK_1\nYeah. Of course, we also started Mohammed awareness at the University of Mosul on the\nsubject of use, and our work means sustainability week, and we worked with posters and\nlectures for all departments and adopted by the College of Engineering, and we started\npublishing on Ayman Makan and that I personally gave him a lecture, today the student center is\nall Joe students.\n00:01:40 SPK_1\nBenwasel empowers sustainability pioneers in Mosul. France food Baghdad people.\n00:01:53 SPK_1\nLet him make it safe. The Masnawiyyah is because he is not saved.\n\n00:02:02 SPK_1\nI mean, an alternative that I discovered began to mean that we have a little bit of a bent hand\nand what is listening.\n00:02:11 SPK_2\nWhat?\n00:02:13 SPK_1\nE.E. Sustainability, sustainability, we are honey and we mentioned the bayha to one of our\nkarquette colleagues, a, I mean Heban Jay on the thing these days of the siege. People\nseemed to mean what people know what to live, then they discover that these people mean a\nplace alone and they reduced it and started eating.\n00:02:40 SPK_1\nOn their need. Why? He eats on his needs in a way that meets his requirements. And it\nprovides to the generations to come, so it is a principle of sustainability, meaning from the\nbeginning of talking to the. With those present, with the students, and they said we can become,\nI mean, we want to do something that we use before it becomes a little continuing.\n00:03:00 SPK_1\nConsciousness becomes the way of such lectures, it takes direct speech, and the road is\nalready happening. Yahoo has more influence so that you already promise every time I enter a\nrestaurant that returns what we tasted, here he answers eating three money, I eat such, every\ntime on our nature from more than one I feed the pain of Zayed food and take it and recognize\nbullying you ruin this The. Verb his presence.\n00:03:35 SPK_1\nOrientation because it is used means older or such. That many people will learn from me and\nwhat they are ashamed of this work and become high, even if he comes home, I can feed him, I\ncan benefit from him, I can turn him around at night, that is, the required awareness must\nalready be before it is by live broadcast.\n00:04:01 SPK_1\nin the restaurant. Yesterday, when I started eloquence, I imagined that I would sit with you for a\nweek enough hahaha. Surely they feel the same thing and everything is benefited.\n00:04:22 SPK_1\nI am sorry. I mean, this is the age that we are coming, but Muhammad Radi bought us\nsomething. And then there are young women. I expect that I have reached Muhammad, and\nbecause this time is short, I will put a time hahaha by a limit.\n00:04:44 SPK_1\nFrankly, I will not add a lot of hands, the majority of us know what the solar layer is and what its\n\nbenefits are, and what are the things that already exist in reality, and what exactly is solar\nenergy in our society, today we want to talk about a society at the same time, what sustainability\nwill it achieve from solar energy? We all know for sure that solar energy will bring us electricity\nand we will use private generators. There is a very important thing, which I wanted to point out\ntoday that is how to use new energy or solar energy in our homes, meaning solar energy shows\nus the production of electricity.\n00:05:25 SPK_1\nDelivering water but at the same time we have the rest of the solar will be insulation at the\nsame time, it will be heating the house. I mean, it's the simplest example today about us.\n00:05:43 SPK_1\nSolar energy is about us inside the house today, if we provide solar energy system for each\nhouse today, I have a small question, the city of Mosul, the building of the hadith. He also needs\nto be self-sufficient at home.\n00:05:59 SPK_1\n40,000 40,040 means we all agree. First consumption is heater, right? Which is 15 to 20 kilos,\nright?\n00:06:14 SPK_1\nWe got rid of 20 means 50% we got rid of energy, but I only calculated method first or the first\ntwo people in the house take the third element, add to Europe, this wedding, but average, I\nmean we talk about a general whole, sure from my house to the house of the son of number to\nnumber, but I will answer it in an approximate way so that we can see an actual result all of us,\nhow are these sustainable homes? How will it be? What are the benefits of solar energy?\nTherefore, I will be with you step by step and pay attention at the same time until we reach the\nclosest approximate result on the basis of which we can present the results of future surveys for\nthe construction of these houses.\n00:06:54 SPK_1\nWe said we saved 50% of the waste, the energy that will be for the heaters right? 50% still have\n50% lighting and air conditioning Zain? Here's the 20 amps in there, the rest how much did it\nfall? Will you make us live? Or. Maybe two if what five activities of the house as a whole, we\nhave achieved five of these things, we have reached a very nice stage,\n00:07:27 SPK_1\nHow much is the average equation, and within the record numbers and real prices are gone.\nThe 50% what heaters heat water? Will we finish installing solar heaters then?\n00:07:44 SPK_1\nWe counted 50% which is 20 amperes which is the sabala. House events. The rest is okay?\n00:07:53 SPK_1\n\nThe 50% we got rid of then, we still have 20 days 2020 subject, how big is it? Its size is 6 kilos\n6 kilos which will neglect to equip the entire house.\n00:08:09 SPK_1\nMosul, if we provide this number, how will we consume the national here? My country will be on\na page that we will use only, or when needed, we will save this system six kilowatts approximate\ncost, average prices, and a life span of at least five years batteries and not less than 15 years\ncolors, up to five years of the device. This system costs $5,000.\n00:08:36 SPK_1\nWe adorned these houses that we built today, Mosul, which is close to the estimated cost,\nMalja. Ten Dval if we have this 5000 dollars, ten of a building.\n00:08:52 SPK_1\nIt's a very simple number. The generator is the long term in the recent period, every modern\ndownload means designed directly for the solar brain, now Mosul and the region have begun.\n00:09:07 SPK_1\nVispor I have 5% of the cost of construction, so what do I expect which house will you tell them\nthat it will get rid of, cut off electricity, you will say if we have a world war, you do not have a\nproblem, you have the housewife, say at the same time you have what travels as a house today,\nall year round, you do not have anything, called money, what is the shadow? Cooling, cooling,\nair conditioning, hot water, what is the beating? Hi? Get rid of the basic things? And at a very\nsmall estimated cost.\n00:09:40 SPK_1\nWhatsApp today is the home of Afak and we all know the interface and the unit costs. Zafta.\n00:09:49 SPK_1\nPeggy tells him is the solar issue a $5000 dog? Can I put it expensive for you? Why? Is it not\nfor expensive? No, Wayne? He put. It is considered to be a need plus an additional cost,\nwhereas if the culture of this system allows within a basic such as a light like a Mai like anything,\nit will be a basic need inside the house, Rah, this, any Jay house that leaves any house. It\nbuilds, calculates, solar energy.\n00:10:17 SPK_1\nThis is a very important thing, after what I put forward, which is the investment in the field of\npersonal energy, which is in parentheses, it is the hybrid system that the grid returns, today the\nhouses inside Mosul are installing the solar energy system, they themselves are within eh? Cap\nline, is I expect covenant text know what? Cap Line, is a privatization company, today Hai\nHouses, Houses Fold. Fold, and an initiative from the rest of the neighborhoods of the city of\nMosul, because it is withdrawn from a privatization company, your production is talks, these\nhouses inside the company were all the majority of them go to renewable energy, the work first\nday in general is what uses anything from the national energy, why? Because he is satisfied with\n\nsolar energy and at the same time he has a solar heater, what will he need next.\n00:11:09 SPK_1\nThey also have a water heater, which is out of the national during the day. For the top of the\ncard I will leave it in a page, and then I will talk about it.\n00:11:20 SPK_1\nWe talk about the state of Eli Ho. At the same time, if an employee is almost estimated at me\naccording to the questionnaires that I have 60% employees, it means that we are back the\nmajority of the worlds are families, families are 60% of the families are employees, if we count\nenergy consumption during the day, it almost decreases from 90%, it decreases, it may be to\n20%, the main needs, if we return energy savings during the day, it will return to the national\ngrid.\n00:11:52 SPK_1\nSo this is an investment in itself, it is the hour that will return this is the first thing that you return\nwith the loser, two, we return to the work is very important, what we are aware of is that if you\npay the measurements, today we are the state is selling us for ten dinars. Unity today if it rises\ntwice twice Dr. Firas, a piece of information I hope you share with us the ten, the ah if the clouds\nincrease it will be lost in magic\n00:12:26 SPK_1\nHe's gone. And the second, third and fourth leap may pray.\n00:12:33 SPK_1\nHe pays 10,000 dinars, from five 400,000 dinars for a residential house. That's a very big\nnumber, what is gone? We reduced the solar system, if the process of returning to this country\nwill return the clock to us, we will reduce the leaps, if we maintain investment over the long term.\n00:12:53 SPK_1\nTwo, during solar energy 30 years old pen. So this work is very important, a system that has a\npostal and an investment process, the important work is also thermal insulation, I mean, we all\nknow that we are saving on the one hand, eh? Dr. Al-Sharai talks about his reflections, we are\nthe surface if it becomes whole, the solar reality, if we almost the sun became on the surface, it\ndecreased by 90%, we are our facts what? Thermal insulation Kalash?\n00:13:25 SPK_1\nThis is of course also an add-on. Third, we have 90 water that I give you an exploiter, we were\ntalking about the heater a little while ago, so I was dizzy to work this coffee while.\n00:13:36 SPK_1\nSo all day around, will these heaters work? Hot water, always cans Mosul city has or anywhere\nin the world, it is the morning time for medicine and the evening, this is the time of use we have\nit inside, we used the solar money in it dirty, the floors and the walls, summer and summer in\n\nsummer, this is another process, we are kidding I try\n00:14:07 SPK_1\nWe want to work on this topic, but winter is known. I now have production, solar energy in the\nsummer, and what I can want converts hot water into energy for me, we work on this the best\ntopic we work on.\n00:14:26 SPK_1\nI'm waiting for my friendliness to receive a result until I see this thread. I want the appointment, I\nconvert it to energy of course.\n00:14:35 SPK_1\nNo, what I exist. But I directly give me electricity from the guard's water.\n00:14:43 SPK_1\nAre there any devices available and your eye can be graced in Dubai? Spade devices run on\nthe labor council until your boards turn his decision into one, I just let me. It is the origin of one\npersonality, it will produce a circuit of a job.\n00:15:03 SPK_1\nAbout us what we work, I mean the solar reality is Rashid, I am finished with them, but what do\nwe talk about water, professor, you mean turned into a map? Which way? That is. Which\ntechnology converts this energy to me? This is an achievement, if we achieve we will excel,\nbelieve me worldwide, but a little will is right and intellectual, I mean, there are no fatigue\nexpenses, think the team of the University of Mosul team are present, God willing, with\nblessings, people with experience, this is a repetition of all the project.\n00:15:42 SPK_1\nAnd see try, and see that it improves the cycle, the efficiency of the course with different\nnumbers, What are the many negatives if we talk about water, how to heat or the production\nprocess, oh away from us one, what are they all economic, we are talking about an economy\nthat is never like this economic, this is you have a saving and where do you go in the summer,\nwhat do I do in the first place?\n00:16:11 SPK_1\nThis is a huge amount of energy that is missing, and we are oblivious to it. No, no, no, you went\nto thermal plants, that's a second topic.\n00:16:36 SPK_1\nPossible other techniques? He means here the sea, because. But it is the solar heater station,\nfor example, in Turkey, the construction permit is only disrupted for homes, but a system is\ninstalled with a heater heater.\n00:17:00 SPK_1\n\nThe environment varies from loads. It has become stable, that is, energy efficiency, of course I\nhave this working energy installed, originally installed for winter in summer wasted.\n00:17:14 SPK_1\nI want to mean why you? Why advantage? I am even the right of something competitive, this is\nan innovation, we the people of Mosul innovated, something will become worldwide, but here is\nit? Umbrella?\n00:17:35 SPK_1\nin Turkey. and by regions. They draw water, they don't get eggs, a third and they have to\nsunbathe until this water gets hot even in summer.\n00:17:47 SPK_1\nAnd summer has come out. Our topic today, the house, the house, this house is about the salt\nof different aspects, it is true that we drew the topic of istikhara is the point that you mentioned in\nthe area of converting hot water into energy, here we are back a way. The way to convert liquids\nor locations into energy, the way the whole world is not. For example, before septoriation is\nhydraulic, the hydraulic method by pressure.\n00:18:15 SPK_1\nWhich already needs energy. Exactly, and this thing will be energy consuming, the second\nthing.\n00:18:22 SPK_1\nFor example, the smoking system converts steam, water into energy, this is also going to need\nadditional energy, considering that, I mean, currently professor, but allow me to do so, water is\nalready a rare and unsustainable source, especially in Iraq. I mean, if we measure the sun in\npal.\n00:18:42 SPK_1\nAnd the sun as a source, the sun is a source. Anyway, I leave it out, no, but I mean you're the\npoint.\n00:18:54 SPK_1\nAnd it means if one focuses on it with a season. I mean, this is a lesson and so on on this topic,\neverything is settled, but we will not solve it with 5 minutes, but we hopefully keep our work and\nthis question has no answer to Hess, but it opens a very important question, can it improve the\ncycle? Come on, no, no, we got a solution.\n00:19:19 SPK_1\nSolar energy. Large, and do not sunbathe, I mean the solar energy system is large, and in the\nsummer you will use it for. For electricity for the house, and in the winter you use energy from it,\nwe agreed in my house that I will do this work, but this topic is my research.\n\n00:19:36 SPK_1\nGo to him from where I started, professor, God willing, so surely, excuse me, professor, it is\nwhat is in it. The cost is great, I mean, you are a big cost that he always calculates for the\ncitizen, he tells you that I will pay for the system of $ 3000, $ 4000, I come to calculate it on the\nbasis of five years, I give the money of the generator and the rest is comfortable and what is\nrelated.\n00:19:59 SPK_1\nThe problems facing sustainability, green houses and others with all their effectiveness, the\nproblems that need to be solved as well. Professor, it is possible, but the system is cheap,\ntomorrow I will tell you this principle, but you?\n00:20:15 SPK_1\nI only focused on the cost, while you did not focus on the process of investing in it, which you\nhave 30 years old, you did not focus. What did you focus on the topic?\n00:20:30 SPK_1\nWhat you have, you have lists, at the same time you didn't focus that what might Abu\nal-Mawlida extinguish you? The voltage that you consume from the generators did not\nconcentrate, the novel of throwing the eye, cutting with the tooth, what focused the maintenance\nprocess with the generator, at the same time you are the process of the cow that you are talking\nabout at the age of 20 years, if the cows use it at the same time. The real guarantee you receive\nand you receive eh? You receive it for five years, you are the right of the Huithiyat, the left of it.\n00:21:03 SPK_1\nWe finished 4000 and 5000 dollars you will pay is an unforgettable investment process, my\nteacher is another topic you can do without batteries in certain locations that are schools. I\nmean, isn't it okay? Layla, what is her work?\n00:21:20 SPK_1\nWhat business cases does he have? They celebrated until the companies were only\nbattery-free transformers.\n00:21:33 SPK_1\nIt needs creativity, she calls it. One of the reasons they estimate they use uh solar costs,\nunfortunately, is because it is the banks they say subsidized by the government.\n00:21:49 SPK_1\nIn the future, we will settle this calculation, I mean, we think that it is five years, 20 years\nbattery, this, but until you think about what you pay electricity, what is dancing, you have\nblackness, this is its name that will be able to settle the development of the A, creativity with\nbanks and with assumptions with security companies. People you mentioned it's all. Every\nhouse sells eh? Employee, I mean, if there is cooperation between banks and employees to\ninvest in solar energy, can you see it increase?\n\n00:22:24 SPK_1\nIt is necessary for a non-profit or a non-profit injury. Certain, I mean possible collapse\nencourage them more.\n00:22:32 SPK_1\nI have two opinions, in general we will be close to this question, which is always why the cost of\nsolar energy is expensive? And why are we walking it? I always ask a question, which council or\nwhich? Councils, frankly, I benefited from me personally, why is there a car we ride for 5000 and\n10,000 dollars? And why at the same time a person? Is it the same car? Is it nourished, fed for\nthe same purpose?\n00:23:00 SPK_1\nWe use it for 30,000 dollars on this topic of luxury exactly you are using the solar energy\nsystem as a luxury for yourself and at the same time an urgent eyebrow, you are using this at\nhome? This is a necessary point. And the whole European field is vector, and solar energy is\ndifferent, but solar energy is strong, I mean, they rely especially German brands and special\nbrands, they have not been dragged like Chinese grammar, but we, by God, are working with\nsolar energy, meaning our money is weak.\n00:23:33 SPK_1\nSo we dismounted to the Chinese. I think the feasibility discussion is a very big topic in\nGermany and they want political dimensions to the issue, there are very big incentives from the\nnineties that exist and there are people who got it, the income of the projects behind it even on\nthe level of Fatah, this topic is very huge, the feasibility is possible for my house that I don't want\nto be spent to buy batteries, at the professor's house, it can be spent for me, maybe I buy we\ncan find that he takes electricity very cheap what is spent for him, it is a different topic, I mean\nwe don't want to defend Something or something, but at the end of the day the technology is\nused.\n00:24:07 SPK_1\nAnd proved the existence of different sectors in the city or in Iraq 20,000, in favor of abbreviated\nin two words, but it is in general, I mean if we talk about our homes, we are sitting 60% to 70%,\nif we use solar energy it will save us the amount paid, generators I will not say that it is the\nnational. With training, one settles the calculations with training, learns it economically table of\nthe subject, any economic table learns means learns on the Hawaii learn things at the same\ntime, and encourage the deputies, the probability of winning the factory of Em Mohammed.\n00:24:45 SPK_1\nHahaha. How can someone talk hopefully?\n00:24:47 SPK_2\nThank you, Muhammad. A final problem raised on diesel is what solar energy means, how\ndoes it replace electrical energy? It's perfect, I mean even at the manufacturing stage, all of it, I\n\nmean, its problems are the least one problem, and we face it in Iraq, that we have solar spirits\nquickly that happen to them\n00:25:08 SPK_1\nM\n00:25:09 SPK_2\nP reduces reduces their productivity. I saw the case of a German company, which made\nautomatic scanners for me every few hours, I mean, what color do you rinse these colors so as\nnot to reduce their productivity, we are there, what is reasonable every few hours one goes.\n00:25:25 SPK_1\nDid you wish? It is available to me in the full, until I come to introduce and places today Pepsi\nBaghdad factory, we are back 9500, it is not reasonable for someone to come out to clean it, I\nmean we clean it today. The end of the project arrives and I am sure due to the same thing.\n00:25:40 SPK_1\nAll of it is there, robots at the level of Al-Manasif, I am the losses that are considered a\nmaximum of 30% of the trains and they are twice a month, if you clean them, all the feasibility is\nvery useful, and at the same time I use small sprinklers and send the panels and help as well.\nThank you Mr. Mino after he wants to participate for us to come there and put a 5 minute limit.\n00:26:11 SPK_1\nI try to summarize it, we are in Dina Governorate, and we want to work on a project What\nprayer? Turn off the cost, but the 100 will be the second roof. It is a new global idea with one of\nits adopters, because everyone deals with these fruits and these frames, we do not correspond\nto the principle, I do not have the second floor for him or anything, I have a roof, it is a form.\n00:26:50 SPK_1\nThe topic is new and we have encountered difficulties and lack of acceptance, especially from\nthose who work in the fields of solar energy, meaning they are trying to keep us away from this\ntopic. We insist that we deliver the result of this point, and God willing, it will also be in\nsomething that means a point of hopefully announcer, we share the discussion, our money I\nagree with you.\n00:27:14 SPK_1\nAnd it's not like what. It uses more materials than, so this is my age more useful, eh, we\ndiscussed a design date in a quick pace, eh? We thought that the materials used in the country\nshould be locally manufactured materials of appropriate quality and be part of the sustainability\ncriteria, and this will divide new economic parts, new jobs, and also take on a large scale.\n00:27:41 SPK_1\nWitnessed these Turkish materials and others, especially since there are certain specifications\nfor red on the roads in Turkey, suddenly the transport is many times brilliant, yes we also talked\n\nabout the form of design for construction must be by a number of criteria that it is open to the\ninterior, expandable, suitable for Arab culture. The culture of the family that is after it exists in\nour Eastern societies, uh, resistance to changes, changes to the seasons, the materials used\nare recyclable and maintainable, and this is simply the simplest standards. Transaction.\n00:28:19 SPK_1\nIf you have a question, thanks. Uh, 20 Ah, okay. Uh, for someone else who wants to share\nsomething with us.\n00:28:30 SPK_1\nOh, go ahead and wonder car. We will see the creativity of the youth there.\n00:28:44 SPK_1\nPeace be upon you. God's mercy and blessings.\n00:28:49 SPK_1\nWe worked on the graduation project of the student of the Faculty of Science, the name of\nrenewable energies, so we worked on an amateur car that works with the northern energy, its\ncomponents are currently as a model and a small one, in which we want to control it. This car\nwe have settled it has several specifications and it works, it gives it a sunshade, it takes charge\nand it has sensors, we do not make a collision so that it is an increased honesty.\n00:29:18 SPK_1\nElly in the vehicle inside it, and it has things, we can charge it externally, and charge the solar\nairport, and we have another idea that it was possible that we are working on it, it became\nfuturistic ideas, which is your support in Mosul, it is a young feminist who is an electrician, the\nstreet is charging the car, at the same time he is going to have charging stations, and the street\nis working with the visa. And the push-up Kley, by pressing the cars on them, will give us the\nseizure. We'll take the boots and convert them,\n00:29:50 SPK_1\nAnd we leave it for charging batteries so that we can operate the imam, this work, and at the\nsame time we are this work and we sift it with solar cells so that it is charging, meaning that we\nwill be able to charge with vehicles with it, and at the same time we will be able to operate the\nlighting with it. These are people's ideas, these we worked on at the University of Mosul and the\ncoverage cells, they became futuristic ideas.\n00:30:15 SPK_1\nAnd my father, I mean, if you can help us think about the things that you thought about, so how\ncan this project hurt? I mean one makes a house if I mean you learned something during this\nproject that builds on the sector of the buying sector the streets We do the right things\n00:30:42 SPK_1\nI mean his house will be in the car, maybe I will leave in front of the house a small applicator,\n\nthis bump does the electric cells, and a car will pass from above and it will appear These ports,\nwe can take them away.\n00:31:00 SPK_1\nAnd we use them. Nice one thinks it's the problem of batteries and roses from cars, I don't\nknow frankly what forms of Balsuf, I mean from Visa, is currently a small Hai.\n00:31:16 SPK_1\nBut it is available in Japan, how much do you have any idea how much it costs? It is not\nfeasible, for example, for street lighting, at least, I mean here this is a long project, currently for\nme. The one we have is no, the one in Japan is priced, you have an idea about it and it is\nobedient, I mean I need after you, I mean, but it is possible. I have studied it and it has become\na futuristic actor, we are something that means.\n00:31:47 SPK_1\nFourth. And the nicest thing is to see the scissors. Val will benefit you with everything, all the\nstreets are buses going up and so on, Ahmed Zaida will show them up to us, destroying the\nstreets, I mean, especially the areas where the load increases, so you see the streets, Mosul,\nthe price of small cars, thank God for safety, and the brother does not dive, the Vizerk will\nexplode on our right, I mean they make what I have energy, but I don't know if in the market,\nwhat are the products? Bezol in Turkey orders?\n00:32:21 SPK_1\nI mean, it's staple, it's the layers, so this preserves it, it's distributed to it, I mean, it's a load\nenergy that exists, we're back in abundance, but it's economically viable, this big physics is\nworking with lighting, this is a topic that you can solve, this, we have to complete I mean. I\nmean, if you expect us to be in a certain place because we were working on a model with the\nUniversity of Al-Nisf and the University of the country's legal economy, then as a big thing it is\nsomething practical in the huge streets of Hai, we are already not available for us in Iraq, we are\nworking on the Iraqi market and we see the sweetest thing, a Abdul Raouf and the project that\nhe published on it, if one has an idea and no color, we convert water into energy.\n00:33:07 SPK_1\nThe water means we have a young judge? So they say that they achieve ideas and make\nmodels, so thank you I answered one of the people, I mean, they see that they don't believe\nabout us, the ability that we invent and create, ah k ksham hopefully, thank you very much,\nthank you, good luck.\n00:33:24 SPK_1\nOh, there were people after the last people, and then they were spread out on chairs, so go\nahead. Anyone else want to share something?\n00:33:35 SPK_1\nI mean, our tongue must want to say something, but I couldn't, and I couldn't anyone. Hi\n\neveryone, first thing, thank you for accepting the invitation and we stay the session, I am\nAbdullah the Egyptian program leveler Spacey eh? Can I have some perspective in which you\nhave communicated to reach?\n00:33:59 SPK_1\nI work in the FA councils, let us be a simple inscription, I will not hit you, your appointment eh?\nEgypt is scheduled to work, to enter the field of sustainability, it was a focus from the beginning\nof the year that we can be encouraged by this thing and the great results that we obtained from\nthe story of the agricultural explosion that we carried out in partnership with the one in which the\nperformance of the incense burner encouraged us the most to enter this field. We started an\ninitiative that is self-funded, which is the initiative of the One Program, which consists of\ndiscussion sessions, some place can be present, it can be Professor Saleh Dr. Omar, it can be\nProfessor Ramadan Kan Rahwa who are in it.\n00:34:39 SPK_1\nInitiative, which is. An initiative that they can talk about more, i.e. youth.\n00:34:52 SPK_1\nAnd born their specialty means far from the environment, however. In the field of sustainability, I\nwill let them tell you more about this activity that will be next month, thank you.\n00:35:11 SPK_2\nI was in the hospital. And answer you. Oh, yes, of course we published our names.\n00:35:20 SPK_2\nAnd who will be because in us this period I am full nostalgia a sixth stage yes? Fifth shit\n00:35:36 SPK_2\nAbdullah Ghazi was not on my class. What DZD, what electronic DDS?\n00:35:44 SPK_2\nYes we are interested in the topic of sustainability, the most, and it will be I mean I don't know\nsustainability it will be different dialogue I mean it doesn't have a wind axis, so it will be a clip\nthat has specific news that you care about\n00:36:01 SPK_1\nIt's going to happen that\n00:36:03 SPK_2\nEvery month we deliver Space hopefully. A session in which we target the youth and the big\none is a session, not just our sessions. Demand for the topic. A. Why?\n00:36:12 SPK_1\nYou identify young people, and people here are a hobby that I don't know. How are you all?\n\n00:36:17 SPK_2\nA gun? How are the youth? The gift? The age of each one?\n00:36:19 SPK_1\nEach one plays 170 Inner youth. Hahaha.\n00:36:26 SPK_2\nYoung people. Hahaha. On I saw me after a month what is calculated after youth, not I am not\ncalculated calculated. hahaha\n00:36:31 SPK_1\nGod willing.\n00:36:32 SPK_2\nHappy. Ah, so we will target the youth group with, uh, different topics, uh, the climate of Mosul,\nsince\n00:36:45 SPK_2\nA city that then grows, and with its affairs, I think this issue is part of, Uh, the women who live in\nthis city, and we did that it was a difference. A period of time between the nineties means the\nnineties and to?\n00:37:02 SPK_2\nOh the climate issue was Mosul, it was a summer resort for Iraq I mean Mosul 50 degrees final.\nThe city, of course.\n00:37:14 SPK_2\nWe invite you, of course, in excitement. Eh? I'm not going to insult you. It will be our session. It\nwill be the end of the ninth feeling or the half of the month of Tasseh means what?\n00:37:29 SPK_1\nThese are the topics, meaning Elly Elly eat the first session, Lord, I mean, for example, it\nmeans.\n00:37:35 SPK_2\nFor example, in pollution. I mean the most thing was kissed, I mean it was terribly in Mosul.\n00:37:49 SPK_2\nAfter the wars that took place inside the city of Mosul, we have more than one right construction\nwaste, I mean. I mean, when I get to the old city, but what. This is rubble, it is the first thing, it is\nthe most important problem, I mean it is the problem, I mean the problem that I am facing as the\nappearance of the city, it means products that you go to, for example, the old city of Mosul, you\nwill cheat on the ruins of possible more than the houses that are built. Faaa Hai rubble. Can I go\n\nback to the water? Could it be on the stream?\n00:38:23 SPK_2\nin southern Egypt. Anna Atluch in the south of Basri like a snow, I mean I am contaminated by\nEloth it is him on the. I mean, I want final pollution, maybe if the wind comes, it will take the dust,\nI mean, it is possible that we will have a retention of mind. I mean, are there any health\nproblems with her?\n00:38:39 SPK_2\nHe had more problems with it, should I intervene like I can? Do you put it in the water?\n00:38:48 SPK_2\nWhat we care about and use means a lot of damage, so why don't we do it? Why don't we take\nit? Now I saw a video about us and I was and Precie.\n00:39:04 SPK_2\nHendor Trielling who he was the. What is the recycling of environmental materials, I mean, for\nexample, we are back, for example, a state, or it is even possible to mean what letters, for\nexample, this house is like that it changes from the house, I mean, they are ako gra aku jobs, it\nis what. What works means, and we don't take anything new, I mean, yes, and if he leaves it, let\nthem be the neighbor's house, or if Elly is on the street, it is all normal, I mean.\n00:39:33 SPK_2\nDaddy is right. We are young people. No, we take the beloved material, we take this rescue\ngrinding by special grinders.\n00:39:42 SPK_2\nBreakers are special grinders, we increase impurities from it, we take the things that benefit.\nWe'll take R. Roman, we'll take the portions.\n00:39:53 SPK_2\nWhat will he miss with the material? For making cavalry? We will make a bead from recycling\nthese, we hopefully features to solve problems, how will we solve problems? Recycling is almost\nthe same efficiency as the Fundogen only, while this cost it will be cheaper than this, but it is the\nsame it will be the same, I mean the same result.\n00:40:24 SPK_1\nEvery bean has an impact on the environment.\n00:40:25 SPK_2\nEvery bean means just what I mean, for example. Yes, the landesto level everyone is tired\nengineer, I am cultured in these things, yes, and I understand the street that you are talking to\nus for example there is something that means taking advantage of taking away they get out of it,\nwe remember that we as elevators from the session here in the topic dialogue yes, I mean the\n\nsimplest thing, we are a lot we are really these problems, but these are us really these problems\nthat we are going to face, here, challenges that challenge the challenges that we are in, I mean\nit is possible that it is as an inside The city of Mosul.\n00:41:05 SPK_2\nOur work is more themed than the focus of each session, it is.\n00:41:09 SPK_1\nWell.\n00:41:10 SPK_2\nThree Assyrians, welcome Hashemi. I mean a big boy. Why? For example, you are the one\nwho can apply this thing, what can change? Va?\n00:41:21 SPK_2\nAko is a problem, if the problem is, why don't you solve this problem? Why? I mean, we start\nback? Why don't you believe? We are greedy for example this thing, why are we not like Aoki\naway from the construction, why are we still like A. We answer even if like Bogdan is a fool who\ndeserves you, right? Prepare the and transfer the E for sure?\n00:41:42 SPK_1\nAnd the target groups, I mean, you have a specific target group if any.\n00:41:46 SPK_2\nShe is the youth who is the youth M.\n00:41:49 SPK_1\nSweet, I see that this means that this is almost one of the sessions that will become and you\nare the people who propose a problem and then come up with ideas.\n00:42:02 SPK_2\nP is possible?\n00:42:10 SPK_1\nThe sweetest thing else. I encourage the people here who are interested in this project, yes my\nbrother is a very important officer we will talk about the future, today my brother the return of\narmies batteries and recycling of species, solar energy, these are of course future problems that\nexist, so you should think about them, among the things that are being\n00:42:28 SPK_2\nThe interviewer is possible so that we can host you hopefully. Tell us about the problems, for\nexample, about the problems that you face, we come back to talk about the problems, we host\nyou if you tell them about solutions, what will you do? Hi? They hear ideas possible what they\nhave means possible it means a very important job possible.\n\n00:42:52 SPK_2\nWe host you in Tigi Nekhel Bodhi. It is possible that we start with the issue of.\n00:42:59 SPK_2\nDo you have to work in it for our own Shlon from Lebanon? Benefit from it on Aco? We have\nplaces in Mosul within this achievement?\n00:43:09 SPK_2\nRotate. Ako was with eating, yes, so the money ate they become compost ie?\n00:43:26 SPK_2\nI mean, it was one of the axes. I mean like the I mean from a special slip I put this food in which\nthey put food, I mean what is the oil alone I don't even sing, the first things come down.\n00:43:43 SPK_1\nWe need the place of all these problems and all these solutions result in their gathering,\nbecause for me B with the idea of training and the reason I mean I try to learn what he accepts\nwith you that We turn these ideas, and these problems and problems into a to a I mean a new\nbusiness, if a new company or a new project, and yes because\n00:44:12 SPK_1\nThe sessions of a brother may come out something, so I mean something very nice, but where\nare we going to appreciate this information, the way that he can I mean, enough of it, if I have\nideas and what do I have if you see me?\n00:44:31 SPK_1\nWrite from the to the importance of. The streets so that they get out of their energies, and then\nthe problems of support lose motivation, money, students' money, I mean all these things are\nnice that I collected it today between the words of the group that I tried as much as anyone who\nsaid something can be in his place about ideas about the\n00:44:56 SPK_1\nThe problems, and we have the opportunities and we have the air institutions and the\ninstitutions that have ideas in this way I will try to write them down and arrange them so that\nthey are open to the parents who are here This is the idea of the open source, I mean a simple\nthing Yes we should not complicate it for you, but yes yes yes I mean Shui.\n00:45:27 SPK_1\nYou will complete it with an invitation.\n00:45:31 SPK_2\nHahaha. God willing. God willing.\n\n00:45:35 SPK_1\nAnd if anyone has a question, if I try to arrange the end of the project, but please our youth\nsince it is what God wills the ideas, and it is necessary God willing on them to look in a big way\nwe can mean the beginning of the project that you have It is even the birth of the God of his\nthoughts on the basis of means especially.\n00:45:58 SPK_1\nIdeas, and do not fall into it in a big way, crammed crammed them about the design project, a\nprojet a is not a little better, but this is from who means whom. Of the ideas that we have, I\nmean. But yes something shorter, yes on the weekend and something, maybe the next wife\nwhen it comes to Iraq, coming in a month hopefully we can do?\n00:46:25 SPK_1\nCollecting these problems and collecting the solutions so that we have this I mean one who\nwants to establish a company and one who makes a project says that I liked this problem,\nhahaha if I develop this solution for everything nice, maybe this is when the next one is on this\nidea Zain, and congratulations and God willing the reviewers who come will be on one of the\nsessions that you visit Okay we have reached the end of the time that we set together, but\nbefore I let you go, because it is that I am walking around, and all the ideas that you learned,\nand benefited from then did not go share them with me, but you are here in the room so let us\ntry to make a participation, I mean we focus on training in all these things that we benefited and\nlearned\n00:47:19 SPK_1\nWhat do you expect from you can, I mean leave it to me to make sure that it is in training, if it is\nsure that the training is with her, I mean facing a certain point of view, focusing on the By\nredoing the business and focusing on the mindset and focusing on the open vana from all that I\nheard today.\n00:47:40 SPK_1\nShare for me. Yah Walid, I hear from more people ah. Go ahead on a piece of paper. I don't\nthink your name is correct? Virtuous.\n00:47:52 SPK_2\nOf course, it's about training, the idea of training is already fun, it seems to consume a certain\ncategory. We have training programs that have taken place in Mosul regarding Hafez.\n00:48:04 SPK_2\nWe are here 25 interns frankly. Want is it a job opportunity?\n00:48:15 SPK_2\nBut it was drinking so that we get the opportunity to do this, when did you reward you with\ntraining your commitment? So this idea is possible that we let people definitely commit and let\nthem go means that they attend and share the motivation to do it, I mean in people who come\n\nthey would not have defended but or continue to mean they continued to have opportunities for\nthis regard. Professor Saleh, Professor Ehab, especially the existing old houses and the\nelements, if what I am holding then Rashid waived with their families, it means that they arrived\nold themselves living with the number of houses that I built because you are a special censor,\nwhat are the elements that never have their elements, Dr. But my current uncle Match wants to\nuse the same use that is.\n00:49:08 SPK_2\nCurrently, Masoud Al-Bab, and it is turning into a room, and originally it was working in Al-Dahra\nby introducing the days of the rooms located to the University of Fa, the main point of them was\nmentioned by Dr. Kras, awareness, awareness, I want the importance of these awareness\nelements. Decorative exist? No, it exists.\n00:49:29 SPK_2\nI mean, these houses use what I think will be the group that has biblical awareness or the\nculture that exists, so I am.\n00:49:38 SPK_1\nNot only the pictures, not just the thing. Why? Why do they change?\n00:50:04 SPK_2\nThe European city but from something they turn into salvation after they get used to adding\nbasic hopefully It's OK OK, it's a better and lower old city, but this is an old city, we'll upload this,\nI mean I take this and apply the 1,000,000 old to the manager 2000.\n00:50:23 SPK_1\nAnd 24 I don't need modernity with him.\n00:50:33 SPK_2\nAnd the other thing that we are dealing with is the idea of a house, while the main work in an\nold city is the fabric that intervenes with each other, I mean, what I can know is a model and\nAbis on you, it is a whole chain, this house with this house, I do not have a ball of foundations\nfrom the system, this system with the system has established something bigger group, I want to\nwork with one house that specializes in a player, is this sustainability, its money or these\nelements of its money? Regardless of Yemen, this is a problem. He will fight for something.\nPrinted to the context around it, from streets from open areas to dangerous areas, everything is\na factor that can be affected that can deal with the house alone with its materials, with its\ninsulators being E. I'm with the system in general, with the, I mean, the same as the high.\n00:51:17 SPK_1\nDoes Hi Mo mean one house?\n00:51:19 SPK_2\nThis fabric had the fabric with him, what do they handle? Why should I snipe dead houses? I\n\nmight have thought that Metin Beach would deal with the system around it, with the houses\naround it, with the streets around it, with the users inside the outside users.\n00:51:39 SPK_2\nSolar energy or reverse streets or fire on the awareness of the subject several individuals\ninvolved in the subject and the main concern.\n00:51:48 SPK_1\nConsciousness does not leave it the other way around. What does it mean? Well? I see the\ndifference between the?\n00:51:56 SPK_1\nAnd the new construction and then the. And this is one of the questions Multi Pal Pal Design\nMoney Training we focus on what? And I mean there is a new building, it is certainly not\nimportant, but how can we do the and benefit from these things? I mean from the house that\nThe past and we update it?\n00:52:19 SPK_1\nA little big question. I don't know if I can answer it. I don't know if there is an answer? For God\nthese days, hey, hay, two weeks, go ahead for training, two points, but I like to comment on it\nthat the exercises must be long-term training and not training, and the capsule.\n00:52:39 SPK_1\nAnd salvation of reporting long experiments. It always generates a person that is serious like\nshe said that it continues, it shows that who will continue who will fall on the road, and also you\nwill have someone who really has skill for the field, or for the process he will be efficient, so the\nexercises must be, I mean, yes, it has a long plan, hope at least means three or four months,\nand also I mean we focused a lot on the technical things that you are talking about in terms of\nthe tools Other than these things that are related to construction, but there must be things\nrelated to training before we changed the names that you called\n00:53:21 SPK_1\nI mean that you must learn to work under a team or manage the work team, management and\nothers, financial culture and financial culture, all of these must fall under the training curriculum,\neven those who inform you of the trainee can deal with all these variables, and can face\nchallenges in a correct way, meaning the long period and this addition. Very necessary\nexercises.\n00:53:46 SPK_1\nMo may be one coach. Maybe? For sure. Among the things that I told about the choice must be\nthe trainees, the most suitable person, I mean, many people have been offering for several\npurposes, but the most suitable person is necessary within the criteria, Malik chooses the most\nsuitable for this project in order to ensure the success of the people who enter the training, it\nmust be, I mean, not only the recipient of the base hears, and the training must be not only\n\ntheoretical, it must be in my work, people are training, how do you apply my work, what you\nhear.\n00:54:18 SPK_1\nWhich is a very important thing, the subject of training must be the. The eight to two shifts is\npossible is someone who is very interested, a successful project, but his time is not allowed to\nbe related to work, you can save for example.\n00:54:35 SPK_1\nI suppose from the lips I mean it is not a condition that it is always morning. For the people who\ncan go, oh, if there will be a fee for training to encourage people who come, you can make a\nsystem that means you are the most qualified people who are rewarded, and these\nachievements can be material or a job opportunity.\n00:54:57 SPK_1\nYou get it from someone, why don't you solve it? Sweet, very nice, that is to say.\n00:55:08 SPK_1\nYes for the flipped classroom It's permissible that Dr. Ah Bassem. Ghassan, I mean, he was\nvery, uh, deep Othman, but we bring him every week if we do that he comes every month to do,\nmaybe we can make a video, and a from this video, and then they get to the one who discusses\nit, I mean in this way videos, and at the same time we are also gatherings in\n00:55:40 SPK_1\nIf aaaa.\n00:55:42 SPK_2\nWhy do we always rely on technology for solutions? Why don't we adopt alternative solutions?\nFor example? We create green spaces, if we have, for example, buildings, which are built, I\nmean, it is reasonable to demolish them until we rebuild them as a sustainable building, I saw a\nsuccessful model in the UAE specifically, Abu Dhabi they have implemented a vision that can be\ntransformed by 2025 by all the Emirates into green spaces. Companies in particular, with\ngovernment support, have seen that it is all so-called green spaces, around companies within\ncompanies, and this means if they see its results as a very successful model, they see its\nresults and imitate the temperature.\n00:56:21 SPK_2\nOh, many things change from the environment, so why do we always rely on technology and\nalternative sources? Why don't we create green spaces? Aye in general sweet even here.\n00:56:37 SPK_1\nIt means more than the means. Feels.\n00:56:48 SPK_1\n\nAnd something else? Is there a possibility that we can do it? Yesterday was the idea of the\nScanninger hands, how? One says Skyaminger Hands in Arabic although he is the conductor of\nthe solutions are explosive in all the city, you go to visit all the balloons and make a report from\nthe specialist, so you go to the house of Ah Jalil from the old houses\n00:57:17 SPK_1\nAnd you take a picture and collect it I mean a little bit like a game that you visit all the places,\nwhere we go sweet, we visit the houses that have solar energy, you visit the house that settles\nthe new insulator, the to talk to the I mean, what distributed solutions do you collect during\ntraining? As a person it is permissible to do a kufrat but I don't know if this idea is something I\nhave and the idea is that it is permissible I mean green B in the form of Ako Ako al Babat so\npeople go and photograph it, and take notes that\n00:57:57 SPK_1\nWhich looks like the things that we are trying to teach that I mean Why is it just in the fay, if the\npunishment is important and what does the color of humidity affect, these things people do not\nlearn, it comes in writing about but they go to visit the experiences of almost one of them Ewa,\ncan we tell people that they saw the city What innovations exist I mean, people can settle jobs\nspontaneously because of the need is innovation, but this is a process of documenting and\nanalyzing it scientifically It's this What is this and where is it going?\n00:58:30 SPK_1\nAnd is it worth it, it's Escila, it's expanded and considered, or not? Yes, for example, we worked,\nwe had an experiment a month ago that we were taking the temperature in the areas, the sun is\nclose to the trees. The sun zones are far away from the trees, and there was a very big\ndifference in temperature.\n00:58:52 SPK_1\nSo you are about 20 degrees. With Spacey Connector, Lo Hai Dakh, Chekha, WFP as Food\nProgramme.\n00:59:03 SPK_1\nmeans the device th. Miama for training, of course.\n00:59:11 SPK_1\nI mean, these practical experiments, as an observation, are important so that people live the\natmosphere that can imagine the illusion that they are the focus of the beginning of the launch\nof ideas and the focus of discussion on the training series, when ideas come and they are\ndiscussed, he will be able to connect what he sees with the works that are very useful. These\ncameras depict the distribution of resolution.\n00:59:45 SPK_1\nIt is connected on smart devices and through the You can see the room and see the W. I mean\nvery very training.\n\n00:59:57 SPK_1\nWe will do pardon the exercises that are possible. For the workers this is the job, money, the\nmoney of building the role or sustainability, in general, we have a topic, eh does that mean\ncourses in the god in the design that concerns insulation, eh, what is it that concerns\nhigh-efficiency devices?\n01:00:30 SPK_1\nThe A, like the high conditions that we mentioned, individualization and telephony, what is this\nimportant topic also this is just the lighting this lighting that we are This is frankly meant as few\nred loads, but its effect is significant on electrical youth.\n01:00:49 SPK_1\nIf she's competent, you're not right, if she's incompetent, even the ones there. They will be\naffected by. From the winter lighting, because it has international specifications, what is currently\non the market is not within the specifications, I mean they will buy a lot of things.\n01:01:10 SPK_1\nI studied the color and the efficiency of the Arabs, the ability and electrical and light things, I\nmean there must be electrical tests, electrical tests, light tests, a procedure I mean but until I\nunderstand in English one you say that the market is what you receive, I mean what I say.\nWhich provides the cheap price?\n01:01:40 SPK_1\nWhich one buys the most? It is not commercial and not suitable for human use and for the\nnetwork and for, I mean, in trouble, I mean, I pulled something, they said I take this on\nsomething energy and such, when I pulled two of it, the room stops and I design with the house,\nI fill the room with the six, and I have a problem with high intensity, the color is extreme white, I\nmean.\n01:02:05 SPK_1\nIt seems to hurt your eye, that's a problem, I mean, this comes out, this is not an action, this is\nexaggerated, this is normal. I mean, this is a very second topic, all of which is education about\nwhat means sustainability or conservation, energy conservation in general, I mean energy not\nonly electricity, types of energy and this also can settle tools or sessions or mean university\nstudents, see the institutions. Field visits.\n01:02:41 SPK_1\nFor institutions, so that one must rationalize energy, I am very much with this issue, but there is\nanother part that bears the responsibility of the government, which is the so-called bal. It's\nimpossible to see anywhere in the world, an airport, a hospital, an institution, an ornament, or\nany large building with a high energy size.\n01:03:01 SPK_1\n\nI mean, is it reasonable to dedicate, Uh, like a thousand or wells in a hospital? And it's cash for\nall the equipment at the same time costs a thousand, but then it's possible if this power turns\nand it is possible that the generals generators only generate 500 amperes for me as a resultant\ncurrent, they turn it on, but I want to go and get twice the amount because I don't have to\nmanage the power to remove the cooling salary, and everything I have in mind, this rises all at\nonce, there is no Surveillance systems for example Monitoring everything, there is no\nconnection between all preventive networks such as fires and what I know what, ventilation,\nprocess ID room and others with the energy system with other organizations, this topic is very\nimportant, meaning everything related to all houses, there are small solutions for homes with\nlarge buildings, it does not mean impossible, it means.\n01:03:57 SPK_1\nPeople can have accidents, fires and big problems, because there is a failure with systems and\nwhat? EA, all devices work in a very short period of time 100%, and therefore what you require\nAjaj means that it even stabilizes, as he tells you, Mia or Mia, and it works, meaning a system as\nif it is parallel, not parallel, especially and even after two dimensions, for those who out of my\nneed for cooling, for example, I can gradually reduce the distribution of what I have of\nproduction to what I have of consumption, what I need to produce 100% and my consumption is\n50.\n01:04:32 SPK_1\nand Ako Mako hopefully. For example, most of what I see when I go. He evacuates the 15, and\nwe are in the inch, I told him that you are going to let me work on the sixteen, if you let you work\nfor three days, the room will not become the exercise, it will be measured by electricity, it will not\ndisconnect, and it will be disabled for you, I told him to leave it on 24 on the five and 20 will\nremain three, the same degree, he will be satisfied with those who investigate a little bit and\nreturn to work, they are not convinced, he does not have this, no, his cell is on the sixteen,\nAnnie, I want to raise until it becomes cold, he has nothing to do with it, it will not become a\nseat, Impossible heat lesson.\n01:05:17 SPK_1\nI switched the Ah to a prepayment system for electricity, so he uses electricity consciously, I\nmean in the same way as the family like the friends who used to keep the heater always\nworking when it became a prepayment and units he turned it off on a need, but the lighting turns\nit off all night, he is supposed to turn it off and go back to sleep like this, but it became a kind of\ncompulsory rationalization. Thus, a kind of equal distribution has come to mean from fair.\n01:05:46 SPK_1\nThe reality is that the words of Professor Saleh, I have revealed the offices of the departments,\nof the state, of course, a building that exceeds approximately 40 to 60 employees, according to\nstatistics. Of course, you target imaginary numbers of electricity, so I came to care. May be?\nThis circle area and 70 m2 consumes 400,000 riyals? I mean, all this is receiving 20,000 riyals,\n30,000, this is a number that is all children, so it meant a small limit, and as Professor Mustafa\nsaid, it was just that within an hour you were in the directorate, you lowered the temperature of\n\nthe bottom and 24.\n01:06:28 SPK_1\nOf course, the work is from Egypt. What everything I did. I do not. You didn't do anything extra,\njust change the six-step motion to 15,024 loads went down to victory except for the rest of the\nconsumption in terms of lighting a room of 5. *. 4.\n01:06:47 SPK_1\nHonestly, this needs culture, the Khush, oh I was. Let's go.\n01:06:57 SPK_1\nYes, pro review. Ah.\n01:07:04 SPK_1\nIs this related to rationalization? Training also or solar energy and its importance in\nrationalization refinement means importance.\n01:07:15 SPK_1\nIn general. This theme means better.\n01:07:22 SPK_1\nNote. Who might be on the consumer side?\n01:07:34 SPK_1\nMost of the balloons known as solar are considered the result. And reduce the consumption of\nwhy? I mean at night it always depends on the battery for storage, so it becomes a culture.\n01:07:46 SPK_1\nSelf-inside the house, it always reduces consumption, lighting what Lotfi needs, it depends on\nwhat? Depend on several. One of the things about the Beit project is that we know what the\ngovernment means, what color do they support? If what color do they need, I mean, they may\nchange the rules, how can they miss this with training? I mean a question.\n01:08:14 SPK_1\nThe law, the law is money, I mean, how do you claim the recycling and the if not the ACO\ninitiative in the Central Bank of Iraq, but what you are doing so far is renewable, because the\nbanks asked for half the interest, and therefore it is now even the law of renewable energy that\nhappened Mako initiative has become. The problems of non-central bank of the bureaucrats,\nand between the money and non-banks, wanted a somewhat high rate, and therefore the\nproblem of the problem of the interest rate itself, and the problem of the percentage of people\nwho already do not accept some of the same.\n01:08:57 SPK_1\nSo it means, knowing the amount that allocates a lot of 1,000,000,000 dollars, but what does it\n\nmean that the one who used it is less than six or 7%? Laws, I mean money The subject of laws\nis complex, meaning even possible a person within a certain institution knows laws, but what\ndefines other laws that exist in detail is complexity between local governments, ministries,\nreceiving bodies, strangely enough, for example, this part of desertification belongs to the\nministry, agriculture belongs to the governorate, Zain Shnu you are not together.\n01:09:37 SPK_1\nThis is a sin, it is permissible even if the Malaysian was sitting does not have, it is very\ncomplicated, this topic I think is difficult to discuss at the level of participants in the training, they\nwill smoke something, they do not understand, what is inside this government system that is\ncomplicated.\n01:09:54 SPK_2\nIt has to be the House of Government by legislation and regulation, meaning if they provide\nfinancial stimulus at least they legislate laws and make them support these projects.\n01:10:06 SPK_1\nNo, even in terms of laws, legislations and regulations, these are basically the same as specific\nspecific targets against the program itself, this program is not only the ILO is working on it,\nespecially with regard to laws and regulations for housing, especially for energy, I mean,\nespecially we had a meeting with the Ministry of Environment. And on trade and investment, all\nof these have meetings that will already become.\n01:10:37 SPK_1\nI mean, meetings coming from ministries and concerned people, even in order to talk about\nthese regulations, and we hope that the government is currently hoping for them, any regulation,\nany change to the law, the parliament is very necessary, which means very difficult and\ncomplicated, that someone settles a change to a certain regulation in Iraq, but it means part of\nthe project, because we cannot work hopefully and exempt the legislation that is problematic.\nLegislation means for legislation, and this does not mean the session that we have reported\ntoday, we are here sitting with the third A.\n01:11:25 SPK_1\nThe place that I mean the small part if I work on it, but the training and I expect if I see that the\nfocus on training is a working money, yes I mean ideas come out and focus a little bit, we love\npolitics always change is from the bottom up, because we are no longer people who are like\ngeniuses in the right place who have the leadership and the tools to stop this change. We have\nbeen all our lives since 2003 to the youth Hess looking for a job seeker, so we see all the parties\nto whom the elections come to answer us jobs and we go to elect them, so when I form\ncommunities of training.\n01:12:06 SPK_1\nIn building and sustainability, and then let it build awareness, and the student is in that it\nsupports a draft law that has been studied at the technical level, as well as what they studied, I\n\ndid not arrange and used them to support as masses, this topic will be positive and this is the\nnature of what it means that we always look at the government, but we are also still continuing,\nthe problem is the rest of the young people and it is part of the problem because it is the\nsimplest experience in 2019 for those who came out we were dreet. We started with jobs. After\nthat, we started demanding change, but did anyone come up with confidence? Executable?\nLam one of the things.\n01:12:45 SPK_1\nI try to think about it, thank God. I have a room that thinks with me Kalash da means hilarious\nand yah, and oh this lecture and the session with you, a that we have a number, I mean we\nwant young people the amount of young people miss the right training about 150 I don't know\nwhat I mean she has a certain number threatened we want to reach him, and more then\naccording to why? I want to hear that there is a possibility, we must start with awareness days\nand training, which means technical training is not things we want to settle and people\nencourage it, they are long in duration, so I see that if we prolong the period, we go for a month,\ntwo months, three months, where?\n01:13:28 SPK_1\nTo encourage us to three months also above, because this is the. The time it needs, so that\npeople change, and it is permissible for me to sit with Professor Muhammad, and hear what the.\nHis training means. Not only do you get one more than AAA, I mean a country and experiences,\nso maybe with you, then we try until you come, I mean the training will be one thing, I mean two\nweeks, yes and we will do after training, this is better, if we do training for months\n01:14:02 SPK_1\nYes, I don't know if anyone comes, I mean, to share ideas from my experience, I mean in the\nfield of training, this is ten years, I think when there is a high complexity like this kind of leaks,\nthat we make more than the, like what was also mentioned by Dr. Alves I, for example, talks\nabout a few general things on the level of awareness, like our plan to target a thousand people,\nthe best of these thousand people is possible 500 we can enter them on Facebook Second\nThen I measure their level do they accept or not?\n01:14:34 SPK_1\nFor example, there are certain tasks, there are details that separate me from this, then we miss,\nfor example, it is permissible to win the third, for example, two specialties, three or four, or\naccording to my needs, but I settle this mahjen that the. Elly it was my comfort with English with\nphilosophy.\n01:14:58 SPK_1\nI mean I pour coffee. Center, this center is that I need and reaches advanced stages with me,\nbut what does it mean that in the beginning I will increase and cost, no, it also needs, and as\npart of this facet exactly another of this ecosystem is useful, it can be technical, and the last one\ncan come out, it can be someone who is an engineer who designs this can be implemented, or\nthis can be an entrepreneur, this is an employee with him or helps him or enters a partner with\n\nhim, I mean it can reach you any. Me. C.\n01:15:29 SPK_1\nEveryone you work with and the evaluation means the second way. We just train the trainers\nand make it be other fields, I mean young people I mean we don't provide training to the youth,\nwe offer the money yes spaces and they go from to entrepreneurship to I don't know where\neach one makes a part of two big mattresses\n01:16:02 SPK_1\nEven what I like, I mean my advice to all the parties that work in Iraq, if you look for experience\nwe search a hundred times in Iraq, you will find better people and their mentality is better, and\nyour eyes are what you want from the end, instead of going to bring people from abroad, but\nwhat do you need to see, like doing a simple analysis, it's a Spice connector, like they have this\nthing accessories, they have On it and so on, so maybe I invest in it after Yes, but the process of\nsweeping them in a direction like another Yes, they are not very good at it, it will be a problem, I\nmean you have to balance the process\n01:16:36 SPK_1\nAnd it should be easy for the ah seeking knowledge that they know what happens hahaha and\nwhere to go or not finished this means what happens later, I mean not that he comes yes a day\nhere a day there, and where where there is information, and I mean it must be a little organized,\neven the guys My sisters are one of the things that if I expect we should focus on it, I expect you\nshared it a little bit that awareness And on social media and on I mean before they miss the\ntraining be a little even if it is a program.\n01:17:11 SPK_1\nYes, good hopefully, Zain aaa I got bored with my head you want to stretch I mean mess it up\nfill it with the last thing, any idea, any suggestion for training, if what with the groups I expect this\ntime? You're welcome, what do we expect from the coming stages, for me this is one important\ncontroversy I will yes I will do I mean drawn I will do yes the training model and I would be very\nencouraged that you share with me suggestions that you agree on, you say this means a way to\nmodify and change if you agree that they hopefully send you a second invitation\n01:17:51 SPK_1\nA second session here if online I will show you that I mean an idea an idea that we collected\ntogether from each other, I am from all the notes and ideas that practically in this painting that is\na little crazy, but we hopefully arrange it and do it, and then I will need I mean We make sure\nthat it is a right mistake that benefits Mosul that needs to be changed, God willing, this is for me\nthe second step.\n01:18:21 SPK_1\nValidation. But for the project as a whole, it is permissible, uh, the second steps that they\nparticipate in share with you.\n\n01:18:30 SPK_2\nI just mean, commenting on a question, I think it is important for us to have a country at this\nstage, that we are after us at the beginning, so can this same group settle like what? In the\ncoming stages? Who will start writing the disaster? No, you will show, show more, the features\nof the. The training. It can be shared with the people who are here today so that we can benefit\nfrom their experience so that they can do the training curriculum, yes, because in the end, when\nwe want to get out what training materials must be appropriate to the need, the market money,\nand must be appropriate to the needs of the city of Mosul, since we are starting items\n01:19:15 SPK_1\nSure, and maybe they mean hopefully units. In parallel with this subject of training, I mean the\ntraining materials that will work I may have mentioned it from the beginning, but I expect that\n01:19:28 SPK_1\nThe ball is the same, I mean this training will be complementary to this thing, that we are\ncurrently integrating it and putting on I mean that we are making a competition with the designs\nfor the works that have been selected I mean some of the works that have been proposed now\nduring the session. For example, solar energy, thermal honey, building designs, modernity,\nventilation, efficient lighting, efficient cooling and heating, etc., this competition will certainly take\nplace in partnership with company owners, entrepreneurs, engineers and university professors\nwho are in Mosul and will be asked from them, and they design certain models, these models\nare specifically intended for Mosul and in general for Iraq.\n01:20:14 SPK_1\nIt is to take the model and fabric of the social connector. Designing these prototypes and\ndesigning these models so that we can take these winning models, which are possible three or\nfour models, these winning models will enter an intensive training phase, this is the intensive\ntraining phase.\n01:20:31 SPK_1\nThe model will be transformed into an application on the ground, for those who apply this model\non the ground. We will start with the program that we talked about, which is the partial support\nprogram for a number of citizens until they adopt these limits, so we these training, competition,\nsupport, and installation are all walking in one field, and we will try to create consistency\nbetween the materials that will be done. A created it? How much? As a training and BML model\nthat we are gone.\n01:21:04 SPK_1\nWe try to get it through these competitions, so we are going in this parallel direction and it has\nto be I mean we guarantee the participation of Mosul entrepreneurs, engineers, Mosul,\ninnovators from Mosul. In the end, this thing will be on a level, so this idea is just like to give you\nthe, I mean, this is for a certain contract, I mean.\n01:21:28 SPK_2\n\nAnd at the same time, as we mentioned, we said that today we can focus on training and\ntraining materials that will target young people, because this is the specialty of Bilal, and the\ngoal that brings you together today is to benefit him, we leave the cridoria for training. We. We.\nWell.\n01:21:47 SPK_2\nWe don't want anyone to enter this training, because we are being targeted. Things because\nwe are technica training materials, I may. You will help us diagnose, is it possible that I uh this is\nassigned to me certain specialties, for example the college of engineering, specialties, certain\nspecialties in technical colleges, we were\n01:22:06 SPK_1\nWe bring down the customs of the technical industry according to the example.\n01:22:11 SPK_2\nFor whom? For whom? We trained in agribusiness, the topic was clearer, we targeted\nmanagement and economics graduates and we targeted agriculture graduates. Because it's\nagricultural entrepreneurship, but here's the issue.\n01:22:26 SPK_2\nWhat colleges are there? I mean we are young people who have an interest in this field, I don't\nwant to bring anyone to train him and tell him come you must love this field and you must work\nin it, he must have a desire\n01:22:41 SPK_1\nIt is yes I mean if someone wants to communicate and complete the right of stuffing, and with\nme yes this means you enter it on WhatsApp, and if anyone sends me WhatsApp and says I\nwant to see the summary of the meeting, and God willing I will work, and Mr. Abdullah that we\narrange this and do it a short hopefully and share it with you, and yes I mean Call me and I will\ncome in a month hopefully, um enough with you on this thinking, and hopefully if we pray for you\nagain I mean we will be very grateful to you visit us hahaha here or another place, let us see\nwhere we do it, and we want to do something called everyone participates, I mean the last thing,\nand we close the talk\n01:23:33 SPK_1\nAnd, God willing, please complete the sweets, the sweets that they brought us Mosul Space,\nGod willing. This is by E, this is wide, this number is Iraqi, but this is WhatsApp, keep it with me,\nthis is what WhatsApp, but this means that the call is always open, if anyone has an inquiry\nabout the project in general and about the training, yes, I mean, God willing, the whole training\nmoney is with Mr. Milad, anyone who has an inquiry about the project in general, this is my\nphone number to call any time I mean, and they will do WhatsApp on it hopefully, Zain, I will go I\nmean exemplary\n01:24:07 SPK_2\n\nMy business card Anything related to youth programs, whether in Mosul or non-Mosul, youth\nprograms at the International Trade Center, can you communicate?\n01:24:18 SPK_1\nYes, I'm now representing the A, and the idea is that everyone shares one thing that I learned if\nI learned it today is short and brief, I mean I don't know it before if you were encouraged by it, if\nit was an idea, then I learned many things. One of the things I learned is money, eh? For what\nyou need?\n01:24:44 SPK_1\nThe text ALA means cryogenic consumption, and we reach consumption for the refrigerator, so\nthat's important, it's Ako A between winter and summer, this suddenly means I learned it new\ntoday. I have not learned, nor a mother, and Hai Fifty Fifty, we have nothing else.\n01:25:05 SPK_1\nFati Fifty Electric de all locations Zain I will select them and make sure they consumption,\nenergy consumption between winter and summer of all kinds. Oh good?\n01:25:21 SPK_1\nThis is it, but the comment was not a comment. Anything I've learned that is new has a new\nrelationship. By God, this is a heritage issue, I mean, previously, the subject of heritage is\nalmost new.\n01:25:35 SPK_1\nAnyone who wants to participate in something they learn today. Saif Enta Jays Shayef Wade\nNew things. I came up with the new idea for you I mean it gave a lot of control It's Wow, I mean\nwe are doing it we want to come up with ideas thank God, so I really like it to be what color, we\nwere able to be virtuous yes hahaha she has a hobby different ideas, sorry English Hahaha,\nokay And the nice thing is that we always had an idea that came out, and we are the one who\nopposes it, but with the opposition of Zeina who reached a result Zeina\n01:26:10 SPK_1\nYes, very liked, and very useful. Anyone else learn something he wants to participate?\n01:26:23 SPK_1\nMother. This is the idea of heritage, it means an idea for me for me.\n01:26:41 SPK_2\nThis is very far from me, because I am a specialist in management and economics and the\nsubject and the means. Japanese for the Japanese language, I don't learn, yes, but today we\nhave to pay attention to heritage, and how do we have to integrate the heritage that we have\nand how to integrate it, and modernity is more important, so it was that we can employ modern\ntools that exist today in the field of green transportation such as the AII, today we have a\nrevolution of mind, so we can not use?\n\n01:27:16 SPK_2\nIn the field of which it could be? Ah. Attractive to young people, since today the whole world is\ntalking about the and how we are the so how can we employ it in the field of\n01:27:33 SPK_1\nI mean, for me, I always thought I had a great curiosity about the subject of construction, the\nhiss of building the east and west, and the souls of the carpet, the economic systems in their\nplace, how they work, but today the session has something different, it is a sweet person of\ndifferent people, like a winter on summer, on everything a lot of interest, wondering and\nreminding, so when you become an idea, it becomes fixed in my brain by different personalities.\nSpectrum time. That this is not an idea or a question that this is information I mean um, this\nthing is good she wants to take us a step to the needle nice\n01:28:14 SPK_1\nOf course, quickly, what is the whole topic, it is a matter of benefiting from every point, and\neven if, for example, information was coming to us, like Mr. Saleh, we were getting his\ninformation and ideas that were passing by us, today we have very accurate information, Nice.\n01:28:37 SPK_1\nAny other reviews of Final Take Away? Believe that I'm like me, like you say about the, uh, this\nidea is what we got to that, yes it's important, this thing is important, and it was that people feel\nthat it is stronger in the heritage that suits the and things like that, yes this is permissible I mean\nthere is an idea, but then when Mr. Bassem Ghassan sorry from the Dr. Ghassan shared with us\nthat no, it is a fact in which it means limited numbers and things.\n01:29:11 SPK_1\nAnd then yes, at the same time, this is not just history, we can learn from it so that we can do\nnew things, I mean we learn from values, and we use the same values, so that we do the\nmodern things that will benefit the region that suits the place, so I expect for me this was a\nquestion like you say, it was a question, there are things we can learn from history that will\nbenefit this project, God no, and at the same time like Hana was talking about how can we\ncombine these Things and things that come out like. Same time.\n01:29:45 SPK_1\nThe things that they certainly had a thousand years ago they would have used and developed\nthem in imaginary ways so we felt for everyone we learned a hobby and nice participation and\nyes send me WhatsApp hopefully, if you want to communicate, and we will send you this notes\nthat are coming from you not intellectual like she said here as I mean the computer engineer All\nthe ideas that are coming out of you so it will be like mirrors\n01:30:14 SPK_1\nMirror in the mail in the electronic and the elder, communication hopefully. And thank you to\nHana and Mustafa. Yes, you participated in the big frame of the house, and if anyone wants to\n\nmake cooperation and continue talking to them, yes, they are there, yes, and thank you, and\npeace and mercy of God be upon you"
