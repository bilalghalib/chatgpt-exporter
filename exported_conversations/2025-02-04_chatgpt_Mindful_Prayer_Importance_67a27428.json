      "content": "**Highlighting scriptural emphasis**\n\nReflecting on the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) emphasis on the value of a conscious, meaningful prayer over a lengthy one lacking this mindfulness, underlining the importance of humility and focus.\n\n**Highlighting contemplation**\n\nOK, let me think. A hadith emphasizes the importance of two focused rak'ahs over a whole night of inattentive prayer, showcasing the significance of thoughtful worship in Islamic tradition.\n\n**Focusing on reflection**\n\nDrawing from profound wisdom, I’m noting that a single prayer with deep thinking surpasses a thousand superficial ones, highlighting the value of meaningful connection in worship.\n\n**Emphasizing devotion**\n\nA hadith stresses that two rak‘ahs with heartfelt devotion are superior to a thousand performed thoughtlessly, aligning with teachings in Sahih Bukhari or Muslim.\n\n**Emphasizing reflection over worship**\n\nOK, let me think it through: Imam al-Ghazali and Sufi sources stress that a moment of reflection surpasses years of worship, highlighting the value of contemplation in Islamic teachings.\n\n**Emphasizing khushu'**\n\nNot mentioning the exact reflection hadith, I focus on the general importance of concentration (khushu') in prayer. The value of prayer is tied to the conscious intention and mindfulness applied to it.\n\n**Highlighting the importance**\n\nI’m considering Anas ibn Malik's hadith on prayer, which stresses the significance of focus and mindfulness. This suggests that only the attentively made portions of prayer are rewarded.\n\n**Emphasizing mindfulness**\n\nThe Prophet's guidance on mindful prayer highlights the significance of being calm and intentional in each posture and recitation. Only the mindful portion of prayer is rewarded.\n\n**Highlighting mindful prayer**\n\nI’m refining the explanation on mindful prayer, using the hadith about the man who prayed incorrectly, which underscores the need for calmness and awareness in each prayer posture.\n\n**Communicating sincere worship**\n\nOK, let me see. I’m noting that mindful worship, even if minimal, is more valued than extensive, insincere rituals. Encouraging heartful prayer in every action is essential.\n\n**Celebrating humility**\n\nHumility and reflection in prayer, both as described in the Quran and highlighted through various hadith, are key to truly satisfying prayer requirements.\n\n**Creating a thoughtful mashup**\n\nI'm curating a special summary focusing on the core essence of mindful prayer, making sure it highlights the key points and ensures a clear understanding.\n\n**Detailing mindful prayer**\n\nI’m honing in on the hadith of the man who prayed incorrectly and the concept of partial reward. These highlight the importance of mindfulness and awareness in prayer.\n\n**Highlighting mindful prayer**\n\nHumility and awareness disturb a short prayer compared to a lengthy one devoid of these elements.",

      "content": "There is no single, well-known hadith in the exact wording “a short prayer with full concentration is better than a long one without it.” However, the concept—that a prayer offered with mindfulness (khushūʿ) and understanding is more valuable than a lengthy but heedless prayer—is very much supported by multiple authentic narrations. Below are a few examples often cited to illustrate this principle:\n\n---\n\n## 1) The Hadith of the Man Who Prayed Badly\n\n**Narrated by Abū Hurayrah (ra):**\n\n> “The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) entered the mosque and a man came in, prayed, and greeted the Prophet. The Prophet said to him, ‘Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.’ He did this three times... Finally, the man said, ‘By the One Who sent you in truth, I cannot do better than that, so teach me.’  \n> The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: ‘When you stand to pray, say takbīr (Allāhu Akbar), then recite whatever is easy for you from the Qur’an. Then bow until you are at ease in rukūʿ. Then rise until you are standing up straight. Then prostrate until you are at ease in sujūd. Do this throughout your entire prayer.’”  \n> **(Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, 724; Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, 397)**\n\n**Lesson**: The Prophet repeatedly told the companion to “go back and pray” because he was rushing through the motions without proper calmness or focus. This hadith underscores how *correctness and mindfulness* in each posture (even if that takes a shorter time overall) is more important than just length or speed.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Only the Mindful Part Is Rewarded\n\nThere is also a well-known report that emphasizes the portion of prayer performed with concentration is what earns reward:\n\n> “A servant may perform a prayer and only half of it, or a third of it, or a quarter of it, or a fifth of it, or a sixth of it, or a seventh of it, or an eighth of it, or a ninth of it, or a tenth of it is recorded for him.”  \n> **(Sunan Abū Dāwūd, 796; classed as ḥasan by some scholars)**\n\n**Lesson**: This narration highlights that the *quality* of your focus (khushūʿ) directly affects the reward. Even if someone prays a long set of rak‘āt but their heart and mind are absent, they may end up with very little reward. Conversely, a shorter prayer performed with sincere concentration may carry far greater weight.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Quranic Emphasis on Khushūʿ (Humility & Mindfulness)\n\nWhile not a hadith, the Qur’an likewise stresses this principle:\n\n> **“Successful indeed are the believers—those who humble themselves (show khushūʿ) in their prayer.”**  \n> (Qur’an 23:1–2)\n\nThis verse makes clear that humility and attentiveness in prayer are keys to true success.\n\n---\n\n## Is There a Specific Hadith Saying “Short But Mindful Is Better”?\n\nSome popular sayings circulate along the lines of “Two rak‘ahs of prayer with contemplation are better than a whole night of heedless worship,” but most of these exact-worded statements are either weak (ḍaʻīf) or not traced back to the Prophet (peace be upon him) with an authentic chain.\n\nNevertheless, **the meaning** is strongly supported by authentic texts:  \n- Prayer must be performed calmly and with focus.  \n- The reward corresponds to the level of presence in prayer.  \n\nThus, while you may not find a “perfectly worded” single hadith, the *overall teaching* of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) clearly values mindful prayer—even if short—over a long prayer offered without proper attention and reflection.\n\n---\n\n### In Summary\n\n1. **Authentic hadith** show us the Prophet (peace be upon him) emphasized praying with correct posture and mindfulness (the hadith of the man who prayed badly).  \n2. **Portion of reward** depends on one’s concentration: you only get rewarded for the part of the prayer performed with awareness.  \n3. **Consistency and humility** in worship please Allāh more than mere quantity or outward length.  \n\nAll of these points capture the spirit behind “a shorter, mindful prayer can outweigh a longer, heedless one.”  ",
