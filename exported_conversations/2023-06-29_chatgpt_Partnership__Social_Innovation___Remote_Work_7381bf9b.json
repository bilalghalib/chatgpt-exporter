      "content": "Louise Opprud Jakobsen is an innovator, futurist, and keynote speaker specializing in the Future of Work. She is deeply engaged in helping companies rethink work for the 21st century. Her focus is on innovating work through science, particularly neuroscience, to create a more sustainable and balanced work environment. \n\nLouise’s work revolves around the concept of brain-based work design. She believes that understanding the brain’s performance patterns through science about circadian rhythms, attention span, cognitive switching, deep thinking, flow, execution, and creativity is essential in designing a work life that is in sync with the brain's rhythm of performance. According to her, the best work, highest creativity, and most brilliant thinking come when individuals are balanced, as brains cannot be creative when stressed and over-committed. \n\nShe has spent the past 12 years interviewing more than 500 key leaders at renowned organizations and institutions such as Pixar, X the Moonshot factory at Google, NASA, Dropbox, Spotify, and Stanford University. Through these interviews, she has distilled their wisdom into new and future-proof ways of working.\n\nLouise offers deep sessions, keynotes, and projects with companies that want science-based inspiration and tools to build a sustainable way of working. One of the major outcomes of her work includes helping a recent international company gain 44% less stress by employing neuroscience as a foundation for designing better ways of working.\n\nIn summary, Louise Opprud Jakobsen is a visionary in the realm of work-life design, with a strong emphasis on neuroscience as the foundation for creating innovative, sustainable, and balanced ways of working【5†source】【6†source】.",
