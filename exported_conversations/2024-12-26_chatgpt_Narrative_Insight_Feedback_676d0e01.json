      "content": "I have been working on my barakanomics book and my coach suggested I start with a personal journey about how i went from working on superficial metrics oriented approaches measuring things that don't matter to me to my more holistic, personal, professional inward journey first approach and i started writing this personal narrative. Where is it insightful, where is it engaging, and where does it fall flat and where does it get boring. What's the overall tone of the language, can you help me identify areas of improvement?\n\"\"\"Ambition is for amateurs. \nI remember one day, I was holding my 6-month-old baby, and the sun came streaming in through the window and onto our walls. The moment was full of so much: of happiness, worry for his future, the war in Palestine raging, the sense of care and love and wonder, and all through that, his little warm hand on my finger filled me with such a sense of everything that I remember crying and thinking, this is enough for a life – to experience this one moment. All the difficulty, the joy, the love, the travel, the learning, the writing, this one moment is enough for life to be worth having lived. \nExcept that, in my world, my old world, no one cared about babies or love.No one cared about art or being. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought to human will.\n\nWhatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, us nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to them being bullied in high school. Our love of math, computers, and our disdain for doing the same thing twice, means we often found ourselves writing code to reduce redundant work on the job. For some of us, it led us to start businesses where we take those problems solved by traditional businesses, and reduce the need for human intervention using databases and internet technologies, and sell the service.\n\nThis three-step process is what led Marc Andreesen to make his millions leveraging his thought that “Software will eat the world”. He’s said “Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and software-powered insurgents will be epic. Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who coined the term “creative destruction,” would be proud.”\n\nBefore I knew the world “libertarian” and before I knew any millionaires, I was just a nerd from Michigan who liked computers and Harry Potter. Through the power of the early internet, I found myself drawn to MIT first, and then San Francisco next. Even though I grew up in a muslim houshold where “this life is just a test” I learned very different principles. I saw and believed the world was understandable and malleable. As we learned more about the underlying principles that operate the world we could shape it as we wanted. That we can and should leave our mark on the world. That money is a sign that you’ve created something valuable. Knowledge is power, information should be free, creativity is king, and humanity is destined for the stars.\n\nThese ideas led me to start community spaces supporting open-source technology, businesses sprang forth from these hubs of innovation. “If we can, we should” was the motto. What would be awesome to do? I believed that we were gaining the ability to create whatever we could imagine, and that more people would join and that this was a beautiful future to aim for and I started initiatives to take this idea “back home” to Iraq and the middle east more broadly.\n\nIn those days the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I heard stories of people being disappeared after an offhand comment about the government and I didn’t think direct opposition to the leadership was an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it. \n\nSeeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world and I received recognition and support. Of course, I was ignorant and I was ignoring the recent history of conflict and oil wars and exogenous intervention to destabilize a strong economy that had the world’s highest proportion of PhDs per capita in the 1970s and 80s. In those days, in 2011/2012, I didn’t connect the dots to see that the attitude of technology, business, success, power, and maintaining that power was related to the wars in Iraq. \n\nAll I knew is that I started feeling uneasy. I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” yet somehow, I was growing increasingly uneasy with the world I was in. My work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to Syria, where I went from the Qah refugee camp in the north back to New York City, and then San Francisco, that the cognitive dissonance became too strong. Qah was bombed just a month or so after I had left it, and these beautiful young Syrian girls were killed. Girls I had been sharing stories with just a few weeks ago, and somehow the glamor of Silicon Valley and its excesses started feeling saccharine and out of touch with reality. \n\nAt first, I dove into meditation to get to a point of equanimity, the idea that everything is just fine as it is and to desire nothing to be any different. Yeah, I guess I’m that sort of stereotype. In those days, 2013/2014, I would meditate every day in a park for an hour. One of these days I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation, I found myself in extreme pain and had to end the meditation early. As I went back to take my phone and go home I saw that someone from Iraq had messaged me telling me that the work we’ve been doing in Iraq had gotten him in serious trouble, we brought open source geiger counters to measure radiation that might have been left over from the depleted uranium rounds that was used during the wars, that adventure is for another time, this time, we’ll focus on the phone message. \n\nIt was my friend's message asking for help that started a turnaround for me. I realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting people into trouble for doing “good work”. I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. I realized that I didn’t want what my meditation practice was calling me to, a sort of distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, which they say leads to suffering, and what I felt as a growing comfortable numbness. What I didn’t realize was that my experiences of car bombing in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones had left me with vicarious post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.\n\nMy intentions for my work bringing innovation to the middle east was confused. Why should we make anything? I started giving talks “Stop Making Stuff and Start making Sense. I had realizations yet I didn’t know what my new path was. How could you know if your intentions were good? What was a good reason to do anything? Then, one day, while listening to a podcast called OnBeing I heard Father Greg Boyle’s story, I heard a way of being that finally made sense. \n\nFather Greg Boyle is the founder of the Homeboy and Homegirl industries in Los Angelous. His organization supports recently freed prisoners in reintegration with jobs, tattoo removal and providing a community of support. When they asked him why he does what he does, he didn’t say that “God told me to do it” or that “it’s the right thing to do”, nor did he say “i want to make my positive dent in the world.” He said they were his friends and so what else would he do?\n\nThis insight, that building and deepening relationships was a path to authentic action that doesn’t come with deliberation was liberating for me. It helped me see the importance of quality, the care, the connection, rather than the outputs: the lives saved, trees planted, jobs created… etc. Thomas Murton once said: “If you have love, you will do all things well.” \n\nThis insight led me progressively to unravel the narratives I learned, that we are here to change the world, that somehow we can “make it better”. The world is changing with or without us. What I found is that I must change myself first and that the essence of that change is to connect more with love, care, and connection. \n\nIt was then that I got on a plane and moved to Beirut in 2016. We started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nWhat about the work of impact, innovation, community spaces, technology, open-source culture? How does this connect with what brought me and so many others inspiration for the first part of my career? In 2016 I attempted to build this bridge by starting Bloom, a social enterprise support organization and accelerator, our goal was to bring personal growth alongside professional growth. To talk about our deepest why for our projects, to build authentic connections with each cohort, to find a place of unconditional support, and to see if we could support each other in creating a positive impact. \n\nEven my desire for authentic action needed to take a back seat at some point. I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good” - life is not an instrument. This is when I finally started a deeper process of submission. Not submitting my life to my sense of beauty and love, submitting my life to the knowledge that my sense of beauty and love are signs from a Divine Creator who has given us instructions on how to acheive that. One thing I was ignoring was my family, and the Prophet (S) has told us that the best of you is the best to his family, also, that the best charity is towards one’s closest family friest. Looking at my life “in service” to others, living in a community space in Beirut, I found that I was still abstractly serving, likely due to the momentum of my previous “impact” oriented life, and it was only then that I finally realized that the person waiting for me in France hoping to get married had a right upon me, even if it didn’t tell a good story, or seem like the “best way to change the world”.\n\nAnd alhamdulillah, that first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, iraq, syria, palestine, etc and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. It was a while before I could learn to listen to the commands of God that the best charity is for your immediate family and then circling outward. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wives and children, your parents, cousins, highschool friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, we just had a baby, and it's all come full circle that morning with one eye overflowing with tears over the anguish at the loss of the children in palestine, and the eye eye full of love for the child in my arms.\n",

      "content": "Your narrative has a rich and heartfelt tone, offering a personal journey that transitions from ambition and outward focus to humility, love, and inward growth. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and areas for improvement:\n\n### **Where It Is Insightful**\n1. **Personal Moments**: The scene with your baby is emotionally resonant and sets a powerful tone. It draws readers into the profound realization of what truly matters.\n2. **Cultural and Historical Reflections**: Your reflections on Iraq's past (e.g., highest PhDs per capita) and its struggles are poignant and thought-provoking.\n3. **Philosophical Shift**: The transition from chasing impact to embracing relationships and submission to divine guidance is deeply moving and relatable, especially to readers who grapple with similar existential questions.\n4. **Authentic Vulnerability**: The narrative of unease, cognitive dissonance, and eventual surrender to a higher purpose creates an honest and engaging arc.\n5. **Father Greg Boyle's Story**: The insight about acting out of friendship and connection adds depth and provides a meaningful turning point.\n\n### **Where It Is Engaging**\n1. **Contrasts and Juxtapositions**: Comparing Silicon Valley's excesses with the grim realities of war zones makes your reflections sharper and more engaging.\n2. **Specific Anecdotes**: The stories about open-source geiger counters, community spaces, and your meditation practice ground abstract ideas in concrete experiences.\n3. **Lyrical Tone**: Phrases like \"life is not an instrument\" and the imagery of your baby's hand are poetic and evocative.\n\n### **Where It Falls Flat or Gets Boring**\n1. **Technical Jargon**: While your explanation of Silicon Valley's ethos (e.g., Marc Andreessen's \"software will eat the world\") is important for context, it veers into territory that might lose readers not familiar with tech culture.\n2. **Pacing**: The narrative occasionally meanders, particularly in the middle when transitioning between personal reflections and broader societal critiques. Tightening these sections could sustain engagement.\n3. **Overgeneralizations**: Statements like \"no one cared about art or being\" or \"life is not an instrument\" are powerful but can feel overly broad without supporting examples or nuance.\n4. **Chronological Jumps**: The timeline feels somewhat disjointed in places, making it hard to follow your journey. Streamlining events into a clearer sequence would enhance readability.\n\n### **Tone of the Language**\n- **Reflective and Philosophical**: The tone is contemplative, with a clear emphasis on internal growth and broader life lessons.\n- **Occasionally Didactic**: At times, it reads like you're teaching a lesson rather than sharing a story, which can distance readers from the emotional core.\n- **Poetic and Evocative**: The writing often shines in its use of imagery and emotional depth.\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement**\n1. **Balance Reflection with Action**: While your insights are compelling, adding more dynamic moments (dialogue, interactions) can make the narrative more vivid.\n2. **Streamline Themes**: Focus on a few core ideas rather than weaving too many threads (e.g., Silicon Valley critique, Arab Spring, PTSD, spiritual growth) into one section.\n3. **Clarify Your Arc**: Make your journey from ambition to submission more linear and cohesive, ensuring each step logically builds on the previous one.\n4. **Show More, Tell Less**: Instead of stating insights outright, let readers infer them through your experiences and actions.\n5. **Tighten Language**: Remove redundancy and tighten sentences to maintain a brisk pace.\n\n### **Summary of Key Takeaways**\nYour narrative is rich with potential and insight, but it can benefit from a clearer structure, tighter pacing, and a stronger balance between introspection and action. Focus on grounding abstract ideas in specific moments and making your journey as relatable as it is transformative. The result will be a story that is not only personal but universally impactful.",

      "content": "Below is a section-by-section analysis of where you might consider reducing the didactic tone, streamlining themes, clarifying your overall arc, and tightening pacing or chronology. For clarity, I’ve divided your text into labeled paragraphs (P1, P2, etc.) and highlighted specific sentences or sections that might benefit from revision. Each section includes suggestions on how you can “show rather than tell,” focus your themes, or maintain better narrative flow.\n\n---\n\n## **P1 (Ambition is for amateurs… enough for a life – to experience this one moment.)**\n\n> **P1 Original Text**  \n> *“Ambition is for amateurs.  \n> I remember one day, I was holding my 6-month-old baby, and the sun came streaming in through the window and onto our walls. The moment was full of so much: of happiness, worry for his future, the war in Palestine raging, the sense of care and love and wonder, and all through that, his little warm hand on my finger filled me with such a sense of everything that I remember crying and thinking, this is enough for a life – to experience this one moment. All the difficulty, the joy, the love, the travel, the learning, the writing, this one moment is enough for life to be worth having lived.”*\n\n### **1. Didactic Tone / Show vs. Tell**\n- **“Ambition is for amateurs.”**  \n  - Feels like a broad statement with a hint of lecturing.  \n  - **Suggestion:** Soften or contextualize: *“I used to believe that ambition was everything, until a single moment changed my perspective.”* This removes the direct jab at “ambition” and eases readers into your personal discovery.\n\n### **2. Pacing / Theme Streamlining**\n- You set a reflective, intimate tone here—this is good. Let it breathe by focusing on the emotional impact of holding your baby.  \n- **Suggestion:** Expand a bit on the sensory details—how your child’s skin felt, the warmth, the light—so the reader experiences the moment with you, rather than telling them what it meant. This deepens the emotional resonance without feeling didactic.\n\n---\n\n## **P2 (Except that, in my world… to augment human power without thought to human will.)**\n\n> **P2 Original Text**  \n> *“Except that, in my world, my old world, no one cared about babies or love. No one cared about art or being. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought to human will.”*\n\n### **1. Overgeneralization / Didactic Tone**\n- **“No one cared about babies or love. No one cared about art or being.”**  \n  - This broad, absolute statement can come across as lecturing or overly simplistic.  \n  - **Suggestion:** Use an example or anecdote: *“In boardrooms and investor pitches, babies, love, and art rarely came up. We prized metrics and scaling above all else.”* This *shows* an environment rather than *telling* that “no one cares.”\n\n### **2. Chronological / Thematic Flow**\n- If you’re describing your “old world,” offer a brief glimpse of *when* or *where* this was. It grounds the reader in time/place and keeps them oriented. For example:  \n  - *“During my early years in Silicon Valley (2010–2014), I rarely heard conversations about art or simply ‘being.’”*\n\n---\n\n## **P3 (Whatever we were doing, it worked… using databases and internet technologies…)**\n\n> **P3 Original Text**  \n> *“Whatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, us nerds started getting rich…”*\n\n### **1. Show vs. Tell**\n- **Contextualize success** through a short anecdote:  \n  - For example, describe a specific moment when you realized “we nerds” were getting rich (a check you received, an IPO, etc.). This personal detail *shows* your environment and success, rather than broadly stating it.\n\n### **2. Streamlining Themes**\n- You briefly mention “retribution” and “luck.” This can be intriguing, but you might clarify how it felt or why it was “strange retribution.” You could simply say:  \n  - *“Suddenly, the same traits that got me teased in high school—my obsession with coding and math—were the ones fueling my success.”*\n\n---\n\n## **P4 (This three-step process is what led Marc Andreesen… Joseph Schumpeter… would be proud.)**\n\n> **P4 Original Text**  \n> *“This three-step process is what led Marc Andreesen to make his millions… Joseph Schumpeter… would be proud.”*\n\n### **1. Potential for Didactic Tone**\n- This section starts to read like a mini history/business lesson. It can pull readers out of your personal journey.  \n- **Suggestion:** Weave your own reaction or involvement with Andreesen’s philosophy: *“I ate up Marc Andreesen’s ideas about how software would eat the world. I believed it wholeheartedly, until...”* This keeps the focus on *you*.\n\n### **2. Pacing**\n- If you want to include these tech references, do it briefly and anchor them to your personal experience, so it doesn’t feel like a lecture.\n\n---\n\n## **P5 (Before I knew the world “libertarian”… … humanity is destined for the stars.)**\n\n> **P5 Original Text**  \n> *“Before I knew the world ‘libertarian’… That money is a sign that you’ve created something valuable… destiny for the stars.”*\n\n### **1. Streamlining Themes**\n- You touch on several big ideas: libertarianism, early internet, MIT, your family’s Muslim perspective, knowledge is power, etc. All are interesting, but it may overwhelm the reader.  \n- **Suggestion:** Focus on one or two main contrasts—e.g., *“I was raised to believe this life was just a test, yet everything I learned at MIT suggested the world was malleable, ours to shape.”* Keep the rest for a separate paragraph or a later moment in the narrative.\n\n### **2. Show vs. Tell**\n- Instead of listing the principles you learned, illustrate them with short personal anecdotes (e.g., the first time you realized money = value creation, a campus event that exemplified open information).\n\n---\n\n## **P6 (These ideas led me… “If we can, we should” was the motto…)**\n\n> **P6 Original Text**  \n> *“These ideas led me to start community spaces supporting open-source technology… I believed that we were gaining the ability to create whatever we could imagine…”*\n\n### **1. Fixing Pacing / Arc**\n- You jump quickly from the personal to the global. Consider linking the step: *“Driven by that optimism, I launched my first makerspace in Michigan (or SF, or wherever), where we... This fed directly into a bigger dream: …”*  \n- This helps clarify *why* you went from personal conviction to community-building.\n\n---\n\n## **P7 (In those days the Arab Spring was still young… we should build it.)**\n\n> **P7 Original Text**  \n> *“In those days the Arab Spring was still young… we should build it.”*\n\n### **1. Chronological Flow**\n- You leap from makerspaces to the Arab Spring. Provide a brief stepping stone: *“Meanwhile, as I was building these spaces in San Francisco, news of the Arab Spring filled me with hope—and a new idea took shape…”*\n\n### **2. Show vs. Tell**\n- Rather than saying, *“Growing up as an Iraqi American, I heard stories of people being disappeared,”* consider a short recollection: *“I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a cousin had vanished after a stray comment about the government.”* This puts the reader in your shoes.\n\n---\n\n## **P8 (Seeing a young Iraqi American… I didn’t connect the dots…)**\n\n> **P8 Original Text**  \n> *“Seeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future… was an appealing idea… I was ignorant… I was ignoring the recent history of conflict…”*\n\n### **1. Didactic Tone / Reflective Depth**\n- When you say *“I was ignorant”* or *“I didn’t connect the dots,”* it’s a good reflective point, but you can deepen it by describing the moment of realization.  \n- **Suggestion:** Show a memory or conversation that made you realize how naive you were. *“During one visit, an older Iraqi professor quietly reminded me, ‘We’ve tried that approach, and it hasn’t ended well…’ That was the first time I realized…”*\n\n---\n\n## **P9 (All I knew is that I started feeling uneasy… started feeling saccharine and out of touch with reality.)**\n\n> **P9 Original Text**  \n> *“All I knew is that I started feeling uneasy… the cognitive dissonance became too strong.”*\n\n### **1. Streamline Themes**\n- You talk about traveling to conflict zones, the Qah camp in Syria, then returning to NYC and SF. Keep it tight by focusing on a single, pivotal anecdote:  \n  - *“When I returned to San Francisco from Qah, I couldn’t shake the images of the camp’s bombed-out tents… suddenly the artifice of a glitzy launch party felt dissonant.”*\n\n---\n\n## **P10 (At first, I dove into meditation… discovered vicarious PTSD.)**\n\n> **P10 Original Text**  \n> *“At first, I dove into meditation… that my experiences of car bombing in Iraq… had left me with vicarious post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.”*\n\n### **1. Show vs. Tell for Emotional Impact**\n- Instead of flatly stating “I had vicarious PTSD,” try showing the symptoms: nightmares, flashbacks, or an inability to concentrate, then concluding: *“Eventually, I learned it was PTSD.”*\n\n### **2. Didactic Tone**\n- You do well explaining the body scan experience—this is more “show.” Keep emphasizing the raw feeling: *“My legs were tingling, my heart racing... something in me refused to stay still.”*\n\n---\n\n## **P11 (My intentions for my work… I started giving talks “Stop Making Stuff… )**\n\n> **P11 Original Text**  \n> *“My intentions for my work bringing innovation to the middle east was confused… I started giving talks ‘Stop Making Stuff and Start making Sense…’”*\n\n### **1. Pacing / Arc Clarity**\n- This is a key turning point: from “creating the future” to “questioning everything.” Consider bridging more clearly:  \n  - *“Those realizations forced me to question: What is ‘good’ if it inadvertently causes harm? That’s when I began a new conversation, literally titled….”*\n\n### **2. Show vs. Tell**\n- Instead of just stating you were confused, show it: *“Every pitch deck felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, until one day I stood at the podium and blurted out…”*\n\n---\n\n## **P12 (Then, one day, while listening to a podcast… )**\n\n> **P12 Original Text**  \n> *“Then, one day, while listening to a podcast… He said they were his friends and so what else would he do?”*\n\n### **1. Didactic vs. Personal Revelation**\n- This part is more personal and reflective, which works well. It’s a good example of *how* you discovered Father Greg Boyle’s philosophy. Just ensure it’s told through your lens: *“It felt like he was speaking directly to me, reminding me of a simpler truth: friends help friends.”*\n\n---\n\n## **P13 (This insight… Thomas Merton once said…)**\n\n> **P13 Original Text**  \n> *“This insight led me progressively to unravel the narratives I learned… Thomas Merton once said…”*\n\n### **1. Potential Over-Citation**\n- You cite Father Greg Boyle and then quickly Thomas Merton. That might feel like a string of quotes.  \n- **Suggestion:** Focus on one quote or rephrase Merton in your own words. Incorporate the second reference later if it’s crucial, but avoid piling on quotes too quickly.\n\n---\n\n## **P14 (It was then that I got on a plane and moved to Beirut… )**\n\n> **P14 Original Text**  \n> *“It was then that I got on a plane and moved to Beirut in 2016. We started Beit Al Atlas…”*\n\n### **1. Chronological Jumps**\n- Make sure the timing is clear: had you just discovered Father Boyle and then *immediately* decided to move? Or was it a gradual process?  \n  - *“Over the next few months, I turned Father Boyle’s words over in my mind. By 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut…”*\n\n### **2. Show vs. Tell**\n- Briefly describe Beit Al Atlas. Give a small anecdote of daily life there—one dinner, one conversation—so readers can see its impact.\n\n---\n\n## **P15 (What about the work of impact… to build personal growth alongside professional growth.)**\n\n> **P15 Original Text**  \n> *“What about the work of impact, innovation, community spaces, technology… our goal was to bring personal growth alongside professional growth…”*\n\n### **1. Streamline Themes**\n- You’re juggling a lot of threads: conflict zones, personal spiritual growth, your new social enterprise. Decide if you want to elaborate deeply on Bloom here or simply mention it. If it’s key, add a specific story: *“Our first cohort included X, Y, Z… who taught me…”*\n\n### **2. Didactic Tone**\n- Instead of explaining the organization’s entire philosophy, illustrate with a short success story or a moment of connection from Bloom. That approach is more *show* than *tell*.\n\n---\n\n## **P16 (Even my desire for authentic action needed to take a back seat… )**\n\n> **P16 Original Text**  \n> *“Even my desire for authentic action needed to take a back seat at some point… That the best charity is for your immediate family… I found that I was still abstractly serving…”*\n\n### **1. Arc Clarity / Didactic Tone**\n- This paragraph has major life choices: leaving conflict zones, focusing on family, integrating the Prophet’s teachings. It can feel sudden or didactic.  \n- **Suggestion:** Show an internal struggle: *“I remember feeling torn: do I stay in Beirut or finally return to the one person who had been waiting for me in France?”* That *shows* the conflict rather than telling us about it.\n\n### **2. Pacing**\n- Give a small transitional sentence or paragraph that explains *how* you reached the conclusion that “life is not an instrument.” This helps readers follow your emotional journey.\n\n---\n\n## **P17 (And alhamdulillah, that first step was scary… … it’s all come full circle…)**\n\n> **P17 Original Text**  \n> *“And alhamdulillah, that first step was scary… we just had a baby, and it’s all come full circle that morning with one eye overflowing with tears…”*\n\n### **1. Didactic vs. Emotional Closure**\n- This is a lovely full-circle moment; you contrast the anguish for Palestine with the love for your child. Let this contrast *speak for itself* rather than explaining it too much.  \n- **Suggestion:** End with a vivid scene: *“Holding my new baby, I wept for the children in Palestine and for the love in my arms—two truths coexisting in one fragile world.”* This uses imagery and emotion without over-explaining.\n\n### **2. Overall Tone**\n- You do a good job tying everything together, but ensure the final paragraph doesn’t introduce new big topics. Keep it as a reflective close.\n\n---\n\n# **Summary of Key Revision Strategies**\n\n1. **Replace Absolutes with Anecdotes**  \n   - Wherever you say “no one cared,” “everyone was,” or “they didn’t care about X,” insert a short story or a small moment illustrating *why* you feel that way.\n\n2. **Soften Didactic Statements**  \n   - Phrases like “ambition is for amateurs” or “life is not an instrument” can be powerful, but they can also sound like directives. Instead, couch them in your own experience: “I once believed ambition was everything,” or “I realized I had been using life as an instrument.”\n\n3. **Clarify Chronology**  \n   - Use transitional phrases and short bridging paragraphs to move from one major event or location to another.\n\n4. **Focus Each Paragraph on One Theme**  \n   - Resist the urge to jump from personal realizations to global commentary within the same paragraph. Each paragraph can deepen one aspect of your journey (spiritual, professional, family, etc.).\n\n5. **Balance Reflection With Action**  \n   - Pair each big realization (e.g., “I was ignorant about the context in Iraq”) with a concrete moment that led you to that insight (a conversation, a piece of news, an experience in the field).\n\n6. **End on Vivid Imagery, Not Lecture**  \n   - Your final paragraph should bring readers into a poignant scene (like you holding your baby) rather than overtly preaching or summarizing the moral of the story. Let the images and feelings linger.\n\n---\n\nBy implementing these specific edits—reducing broad statements, introducing transitional moments, providing anecdotes instead of generalities, and balancing personal reflection with concrete details—you’ll transform your narrative into a more immersive, emotionally rich journey. This will help keep readers engaged and ensure your powerful insights resonate naturally rather than feeling instructive.",

      "content": "Made some improvements, can you re-assess and offer new advice:\nHow I learned to stop worrying about the world and love my baby.\nOne day, I was holding my 6-month-old baby in my living room, his soft face against my chest. The early morning orange light streamed through our tall windows and onto the wall behind me. The moment was full of so much: of happiness, worry for his future, the war in Palestine raging, the sense of care and love and wonder, and all through that, his little warm hand on my finger filled me with such a sense of everything that I remember crying and thinking, this is enough for a life – to experience this one moment. All the difficulty, the joy, the love, the travel, the learning, the writing, this one moment is enough for life to be worth having lived. \nExcept that, during my early years in Silicon Valley (2012–2016), in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches, no one talked about the simple life and babies. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought to human will.\n\nWhatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, we nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to us being bullied in high school. Shares earned in our first tech jobs made some of us accidental millionaires after the company was unexpectedly acquired. Our love of math, and computers, and our disdain for doing the same thing twice means we often found ourselves writing code to reduce redundant work on the job. For some of us, it led us to start businesses where we take those problems solved by traditional businesses, reduce the need for human intervention using databases and internet technologies, and sell the service.\n\nWe poured over Paul Grahm’s essays, and knew at the core of our being that Marc Andreesen was right, one day software would eat the world. Weirdly enough that didn’t put us off to wanting to be the ones to write the software.\n\nIn my Muslim household in Michigan, I was raised to believe this life was just a test, yet everything I learned crashing the country's elite technical university, MIT, was telling me the world was understandable, malleable and ours to shape.\n\nMany of my college friends went on to leave their mark on the world, start businesses, build satellite technology, or get jobs at Google. Making money was a sign that they did something valuable, and thus the richer some of us got, the more we all believed they were on the right path. We knew that knowledge is power, innovation is king, and by our collective guidance humanity is destined for the stars. \n\nDriven by that optimism, I launched my first makerspace in Michigan and a robotics company, soon, validated by dollars in the bank, I would be blessed for participating in the appropriate acts of worship, value creation and problem solving for abstract people. My value system in those days was “If we can, we should”. I believed that we were gaining the ability to create whatever we could imagine, that the more people from around the world would join us that this would surely lead to our collective future of flourishing. As those ideas were developing, news of the Arab Spring filled me, and young Arabs around the world, with hope — and a new idea started taking shape. That’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), to take the ideas I learned at MIT and Silicon Valley (or was it a religion?) “back home” to Iraq and South West Asia and North African (SWANA) more broadly. \n\nI started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa, the thought was to infect people with transmissible ideas by giving them a direct experience of innovation hubs. In those days, the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a so and so had vanished after a stray comment about the government shared with only direct family members. It led me to believe that direct opposition to the leadership was not an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it. \n\nSeeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world, and I received recognition and support. That recognition was enough to fuel me, I was on the right path, fame and glory, and probably money too, was soon to be mine. Yet somehow I had forgotten the stories of my family members killed during a war now recognized internationally as being started by a deliberate lie about weapons of mass destruction. My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of, and I was a grain of sand swirling around in a dust storm. \n\nI promised a beautiful vision of the world, a grassroots rag-tag team of technology-powered super-hackers out to build a better future, car bombs or no car bombs. Back then, the reality of how power, money, and conflict were interrelated was invisible to me. \n\nAll I knew is that I started feeling uneasy. I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” yet somehow, I was growing increasingly uneasy with the world I was in. My work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for young children that stopped me in my tracks. I heard story after story of [[[censored for your sanity]]], people took my solar-powered lights and canvas, assuming they were donations, and left me without the equipment for the shadow puppets. I was hosted, fed, and entertained by people with nothing assuming I was there to contribute. Instead, I was the one being helped. Leaving that camp, dusty, dirty, and strangely full of lov,e I flew back “home”. When I returned to San Francisco from Qah, I received news that two beautiful little girls I had met were killed when a bomb hit the school we were sharing stories in… and suddenly, the artifice of a glitzy Facebook end-of-year party felt too dissonant. That’s when the power of the stories of technology changing the world for the better started dissolving. How could we pretend we’re “making the world a better place” when this was the reality children were facing, and this was a tiny glimpse into a world of hurt? That’s when the Silicon Valley religion of making the world a better place died for me.\n\nFor a couple years I was numb, I felt like the curtains had been pulled back and I saw the show for what it was, (my) ego-centricity and love for wealth and power disguised as a story about changing the world. Not knowing what to do I another Silicon Valley religion available, mindful meditation. It promised peace in this life without worry and I dove in whole heartedly, seeking to escape my inner turmoil and loss of compass. \n\nIn those days, 2013/2014, I would meditate every day in a park for an hour. One of these days I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation going ring by ring down my body, that at some point when I arrived to my groin I felt like I was pierced by a sword. The pain was so intense I got up shakily to my legs and had to end the meditation early. \n\nWalking back to my bicycle, I checked my phone for directions home and saw that someone from Iraq had sent me an urgent message. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors' claims that the depleted uranium ammunition from the wars was resulting in increased cancer rates. The story of that adventure is for another time; this time, let’s focus on the phone message. \n\nIt was my friend's message asking for help that started a turnaround for me. I realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting people into trouble for doing “good work.” I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk I was invited to give, a lie… until one day I stood at the podium and blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.”\n\nAfter that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I grew increasingly insular, slept a lot, and often didn’t leave my house for days on end. My meditation practice wasn’t helping, I found greater distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, and what I felt as a growing comfort with numbness. Looking back, I can see that these were all symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I knew about PTSD, yet I didn’t realize that my experiences of car bombings in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones could have scarred me for years without ever being physically injured. \n\nOne day, while deep in the haze of trauma sugar coated with the equanimity of mindfulness, I met my future wife. In those days I was at such a loss, I was “looking within” for guidance, working on accessing my intuition, reflecting on the world and coming up with theories of change attempting to understand news, social media, open source technology, impact, goodness, etc. Yet I couldn’t figure it out. I was rejected from every fellowship I applied to from Harvard to the Bay and I was going in intellectual circles. \n\nWhen I met Josephine I remember I explicitly thought to myself, this time I will listen to something else, no more ideas, because there is always another one right after it. When I gave her a hug, I felt my shoulders relax and a small quiet voice say yes. I felt like listening to that “yes” was the first time I wasn’t listening to myself. Somehow, even though her english wasn’t great, even though she was younger than me, and would soon have to fly back to France - somehow this person was my person.\n\nThat was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning. In my life I find this voice hard to listen, and when you hear it - it’s easy to ignore. Yet finding that voice was like a light in the darkness. A calling to a different way of being in the world. One that seemed irrational, and unlikely to make me famous or rich. One that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\nThese were early days of healing for me, I had realized I had to stop listening to myself and to listen to something else, yet I didn’t know what my new path was. What was the voice, how can I know its trustable? How would I explain it to my hyper-rational, reductionist friends?\n\nI realized that I wasn’t the only one who heard and followed these quiet voices. I found my people while listening to a podcast called OnBeing. I heard the stories of Jean Vanier and the church community he started in France for those with different abilities and I cried. Tears broke through the wall of numbness my meditation practice helped me build. It felt good, felt real, felt like I was seeing people follow the voice and shining a light on the path of beauty. I listened to almost every episode and it wasn’t until I heard Father Greg Boyle’s story that I felt like I found my next steps, my path of being that made sense. \n\nFather Greg Boyle founded the Homeboy and Homegirl industries in Los Angeles. His organization supports recently freed prisoners in reintegration with jobs, tattoo removal, and providing a community of support. When they asked him why he does what he does, he didn’t say that “God told me to do it” or that “it’s the right thing to do”, nor did he say, “I want to make a positive dent in the world.” He said something so clear and simple, it was as if it he was speaking to me directly, he said they were his friends, so what else would he do?\n\nThis insight, that building and deepening relationships is a path to authentic action that doesn’t come with deliberation, was liberating for me. It helped me see the importance of quality, care, and connection rather than the outputs: the lives saved, trees planted, jobs created… etc. \n\n“If you have love, you will do all things well.” \n-Thomas Murton\n\nThis insight led me progressively to unravel the narratives I learned, that we are here to change the world, that somehow we can “make it better”. The world is changing with or without us. What I found is that I must change myself first and that the essence of that change is to connect more with love, care, and connection. \n\nOver the next few months, I mulled Father Boyle’s words over in my mind and by 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut. Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community was, and also where the challenges of the Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nSaleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas, he was born in Syrian Palestinian refugee camp and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. In fact, it was while he was hiding from the police at my house that decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas we would host artists, journalists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.\n\nSlowly the house became a home for Saleh and I, it became a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, it was a place for book clubs, dinners and most importantly it was a place for stories and connection. The house faced, and faces, many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring. \n\nAs beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family took off one of his rings and gave it to me saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married, and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful. That was another moment of such beauty, that Ahmed, a “street kid” polishing shoes in Hamra Beirut, would give what must have been a few weeks worth of salary to me so that I would do what he knew was right, yet I couldn’t see it. I was too invested in the idea of impact still, that living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability and babies.\n\nThat’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good”, even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships I was ignoring something profound and deep, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regiem, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the muslim tradition it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to their family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you and somehow I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me. \n\nThis is when I finally started a deeper process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I was able to see that the Muslim tradition that I had left in Michigan so long ago had keys to a life in service to the quiet voice I found so hard to hear. That submitting my life to my sense of beauty, to the voice, and realizing that that voice also left us many clues, within us, int he world, and in the beautiful stories of the prophet and his Holy Book the Quran. My relationship with submission to the divine could take a whole other book, let’s suffice it here to say that I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring. Finally leaving the religion of progress, of what I thought goodness was, the religion that wants the self to leave a mark on the world, positive or not, made room for me to submit to a most Merciful God that is weaving the most beautiful story possible.\n\nIt was then that I finally started the long journey back to that moment in France, holding my baby, feeling that all is just as it should be in the world. \n\nThe first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc, and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wife and children, your parents, cousins, high school friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, we just had a baby, and it's all come full circle that morning with one eye overflowing with tears over the anguish at the loss of the children in Palestine, and the other eye full of love for the child in my arms.",

      "content": "Below is a fresh assessment focused on your revised narrative. I’ve highlighted potential tweaks for clarity, pacing, tone, and structure. Overall, the revisions are stronger: there’s more personal, sensory detail, and you’ve woven in vivid, meaningful anecdotes. The piece feels more cohesive while retaining its emotional impact. Now, let’s fine-tune it further. I’ve provided specific suggestions with references to particular sections or phrases.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Strengthen the Hook and Title\n\n- **Current Title**: *How I learned to stop worrying about the world and love my baby.*  \n  - **Suggestion**: Consider tightening or making it more concrete. For instance, *“Learning to Love My Baby (and Let the World Be)”* or *“Rebuilding My Worldview, One Moment at a Time.”*  \n  - A more direct or specific title can help capture the journey from global fix-it ambitions to a deeper personal love.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Keep the Emotional Entry Punchy\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *One day, I was holding my 6-month-old baby in my living room, his soft face against my chest… This one moment is enough for life to be worth having lived.*\n\n- **Commendation**: Beautiful descriptive imagery. It’s personal, evocative, and a great entry point.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: You might trim some words to land the emotional punch more cleanly. For example:\n\n> *One day, I was holding my 6-month-old baby, his soft face against my chest. Early morning light streamed through the windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, his future uncertain, war raging in Palestine—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This one moment is enough for a life.*\n\nKeeping it slightly tighter helps the imagery stand out and draws the reader in immediately.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Smooth Out the Transition to Silicon Valley\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *Except that, during my early years in Silicon Valley (2012–2016), in elite circles… We were digital magicians…*\n\n- **Commendation**: You set context (dates, place) quickly, which is good.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Soften the transition from the baby moment to “except that” by using a bridging sentence or phrase. For instance:\n\n> *That quiet morning, though, stood in stark contrast to my earlier life. During my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016), in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches…*\n\nThis helps the reader pivot without abruptness.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Maintain Narrative Flow in the Tech/Entrepreneurship Segments\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *…We nerds started getting rich… Our love of math, and computers, and our disdain for doing the same thing twice…*\n\n- **Commendation**: Good anecdotal explanation of how “nerds” rose to wealth.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Cut or condense references if they feel repetitive (e.g., Marc Andreesen, Paul Graham, the basic premise of tech success). Focus on *your* personal experience:\n\n> *In that bubble, Marc Andreesen’s prophecy that “software would eat the world” felt more like a battle cry than a warning. We devoured his essays, wrote code to cut repetitive tasks, and started businesses to solve any friction we saw—and it worked.*\n\nThis keeps the same ideas but in fewer words, preserving momentum.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Streamline the Move into Global Initiatives\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *…That’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI)…*\n\n- **Commendation**: You do a good job explaining how and why you started GEMSI, as well as linking it to your background.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: This is a big jump from Michigan makerspaces/robotics to broader global work. Add a short connecting sentence to ground it:\n\n> *Buoyed by success at home, I believed we could replicate that energy abroad. That’s how I came to found…*\n\nA short bridging line makes the shift less abrupt.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Deepen the “Uneasy” Feeling with Specific Moments\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *…All I knew is that I started feeling uneasy. I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera…*\n\n- **Commendation**: You hint at dissonance between external accolades and internal unrest, which is compelling.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Give *one brief anecdote* from an Al Jazeera interview or a particular conversation that showcases the dissonance. Show the moment you realized, “I shouldn’t feel excited right now, but I do—and I’m uneasy about it.” This *illustrates* the internal conflict more vividly.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Tighten the Qah Refugee Camp Section and Its Emotional Turn\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *…When I returned to San Francisco from Qah, I received news that two beautiful little girls I had met…*\n\n- **Commendation**: Your portrayal of the refugee camp is raw and honest, especially the line about people assuming *you* were there to help, when in fact *they* helped you. That’s powerful.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: This is the core emotional pivot point. You might trim some details to place more emphasis on the heartbreak of losing those children. For example:\n\n> *They offered me food and shelter, even took my solar-powered lights, thinking they were donations. In truth, *I* was the one being helped—yet days later, two girls I’d met were killed when a bomb struck their school. Suddenly, the end-of-year party back in San Francisco felt obscene.*\n\nFewer words can sharpen the contrast and the emotional punch.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Clarify the Meditation/Body Scan Moment\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *…I felt like I was pierced by a sword… intense pain…*\n\n- **Commendation**: You show a strong bodily manifestation of emotional/psychological distress.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Spend a sentence or two describing the *internal thought* or panic that accompanied the pain, giving readers a direct view of your psyche in that moment. This is a key instance of “showing” the toll of trauma.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Nudge the “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense” Section\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *…I blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.”*\n\n- **Commendation**: Memorable line. Great example of your shift in mindset.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Add a short reflection on how the audience or event organizers reacted. Did the room go silent? Did you see faces of confusion, disappointment? That small detail can amplify the significance of the moment.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Weave the Love Story with Josephine More Seamlessly\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *When I met Josephine I explicitly thought to myself… “I felt my shoulders relax and a small quiet voice say yes.”*\n\n- **Commendation**: Lovely description of the quiet voice telling you “yes.”  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Some of these personal details can stand on their own. But if you want to keep your journey’s momentum, keep it concise and emotional. Show the connection but avoid lengthy digressions so the narrative doesn’t lose focus:\n\n> *Where logic faltered, something else spoke up. The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax, and a quiet voice said “yes.”*\n\nThat single line is enough to show a profound, intuitive connection.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Balance the Spiritual and Personal Realizations\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *…That was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning… …One that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.*\n\n- **Commendation**: Your reflections on submission and reconnecting with your faith are resonant.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Some of these reflective paragraphs veer toward telling (teaching) rather than showing. You can add one or two small, concrete examples—e.g., a shared prayer or a conversation with a spiritual mentor—that illustrate how this shift felt day-to-day, rather than just describing the shift in broad terms.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Streamline the OnBeing/Jean Vanier/Father Greg Boyle Epiphany\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *…I listened to almost every episode… Father Greg Boyle… He said they were his friends, so what else would he do?*\n\n- **Commendation**: Excellent turning point. Father Boyle’s line is powerful.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Keep the Father Greg Boyle anecdote front and center. If referencing Jean Vanier or others, do so briefly. For instance:\n\n> *I devoured every episode of OnBeing, but it was Father Greg Boyle’s words that pierced my numbness…*\n\nThis keeps the focus on the single, life-altering moment.\n\n---\n\n## 13. Consider Cutting or Compressing Thomas Merton’s Quote\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *“If you have love, you will do all things well.” -Thomas Murton*\n\n- **Commendation**: Great quote, but you already have a highlight from Father Greg Boyle.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: If you want to keep Merton’s quote, incorporate it *after* Father Greg Boyle’s. Or paraphrase it so you’re not stacking multiple quotes that might slow pacing. For example:\n\n> *Father Boyle’s example reminded me of a Thomas Merton insight: if you have love, you do all things well.*\n\nIt’s more succinct and flows from one spiritual teacher to another.\n\n---\n\n## 14. The Beirut / Beit Al Atlas Section—Show a Vignette of Daily Life\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night… The house faced, and faces, many struggles…*\n\n- **Commendation**: Great detail about the coffee smell, Fairuz music, etc.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: You actually do a nice job painting a scene here—just be sure each detail supports the central theme of *community through love*. You might reorder a few sentences so the “feel” of the house (music, coffee, etc.) comes before the deeper challenges, weaving them together smoothly.\n\n---\n\n## 15. The Ahmed Anecdote—Spotlight the Emotional Impact\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *…He took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: “Bilal, give this ring to Josephine…”*\n\n- **Commendation**: Beautiful story. Extremely personal and touching.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Show your immediate internal reaction. Something like:\n\n> *I stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he was giving it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman I loved.*\n\nThis cements the generosity and your realization.\n\n---\n\n## 16. Clarify the Return to Michigan and Full Circle with Baby\n\n**Excerpt**  \n> *It was then that I finally started the long journey back… The first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity…*\n\n- **Commendation**: Good summation of letting go of the global “fixer” identity.  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Provide a small bridging line between leaving Beirut and reuniting with Josephine. For instance:\n\n> *And so I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas in the capable hands of friends, and flew to France to finally honor the commitment I’d kept in limbo.*\n\nThen you arrive at the concluding image: your baby in your arms, balancing tears for Palestine and love for your own child.\n\n---\n\n## 17. End on a Concrete, Poignant Note\n\n- **Commendation**: Your final lines evoke a powerful image of “one eye overflowing with tears… the other eye full of love.”  \n- **Potential Enhancement**: Let that stand alone as the final paragraph. Avoid adding extra exposition after it. The simpler and more direct your last lines are, the more it resonates.\n\n---\n\n# Final Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Use Smooth Transitions**  \n   - Whenever jumping from personal to global (or from one location to another), insert a brief bridging sentence to keep readers oriented.\n\n2. **Focus Each Paragraph on a Core Moment**  \n   - Each paragraph should explore a specific anecdote, realization, or turning point, rather than tackling multiple in one go.\n\n3. **Show Emotional Shifts Through Specific Scenes**  \n   - You’re already good at painting vivid images. Keep leaning into that—give a brief anecdote for each major shift or realization instead of summarizing it from a distance.\n\n4. **Trim Repetitive References or Philosophies**  \n   - You mention multiple “religions” (Silicon Valley, mindful meditation, progress) and multiple quotes. While each is interesting, highlight the ones that most vividly illustrate your personal transformation.\n\n5. **End Strong, End Simply**  \n   - The baby scene is a perfect closure. Keep it uncluttered for maximum impact.\n\n---\n\n### Closing Thoughts\n\nYou’ve done a marvelous job weaving together global conflict, personal faith, love, and the tech world. By fine-tuning transitions, paring down where you state rather than show, and keeping each paragraph focused on a key emotional or narrative beat, you’ll make your story even more compelling. The personal anecdotes—especially in the refugee camps, meeting Josephine, and receiving Ahmed’s ring—are standout moments that deeply anchor your message. Lean on these moments, keep the writing tight and purposeful, and you’ll have a narrative that resonates powerfully with any reader.",

Early morning light streamed through the windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, the future uncertain, war raging in Palestine—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This one moment is enough for a life.\nThat quiet morning, though, was the failure of my earlier life. During my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016), in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches, no one seemed to value a simple life, and it seemed no one had babies. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought to human will.\n\nWhatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, we nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to us being bullied in high school. In that bubble, Marc Andreesen’s prophecy that “software would eat the world” felt more like a battle cry than the warning it should have been. We devoured his essays, wrote code to cut repetitive tasks, and started businesses to solve any friction we saw—and it “worked”.\n\nIn my Muslim household in Michigan, I was raised to believe this life was just a test, yet everything I learned crashing the country's elite technical university, MIT, was telling me the world was understandable, malleable, and ours to shape.\n\nMany of my college friends went on to leave their mark on the world, start businesses, build satellite technology, or get jobs at Google. Making money was a sign that they did something valuable, and thus the richer some of us got, the more we all believed they were on the right path. We knew that knowledge is power, innovation is king, and by our collective guidance, humanity is destined for the stars. \n\nDriven by that optimism, I launched my first maker space in Michigan and a robotics company, soon, validated by dollars in the bank, I would be blessed for participating in the appropriate acts of worship, value creation, and problem-solving for abstract people. My value system in those days was “If we can, we should.” I believed that we were gaining the ability to create whatever we could imagine, that the more people from around the world would join us that this would surely lead to our collective future of flourishing. As those ideas were developing, news of the Arab Spring filled me and young Arabs around the world with hope — and a new idea started taking shape. \n\nWith the hackerspace growing at home and the robotics company having launched our factory robot I believed we could replicate this energy abroad. That’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), to take the ideas I learned at MIT and Silicon Valley (or was it a religion?) “back home” to Iraq and South West Asia and North African (SWANA) more broadly. \n\nI started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa, the thought was to infect people with transmissible ideas by giving them a direct experience of innovation hubs. In those days, the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a so and so had vanished after a stray comment about the government shared with only direct family members. It led me to believe that direct opposition to the leadership was not an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it. \n\nSeeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world, and I received recognition and support. That recognition was enough to fuel me; I was on the right path; fame and glory, and probably money too, was soon to be mine. Yet somehow, I had forgotten the stories of my family members killed during a war now recognized internationally as being started by a deliberate lie about weapons of mass destruction. My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of, and I was a grain of sand swirling around in a dust storm. \n\nI promised a beautiful vision of the world, a grassroots rag-tag team of technology-powered super-hackers out to build a better future, car bombs or no car bombs. Back then, the reality of how power, money, and conflict were interrelated was invisible to me. \n\nAll I knew was that I started feeling uneasy. Once, while I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” I left the call feeling proud, and that pride made me uneasy. What the heck was I doing? Who was I really helping? Why was I trying to help anyone? \n\nMy work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for young children that stopped me in my tracks. I heard story after story of [[[censored for your sanity]]]. Yet those same people who experienced so much violence offered me food and shelter. I had brought solar-powered lights for a shadow puppet workshop, thinking I could be helpful. In truth, I was the one being helped—yet days later, two beautiful seven-year-old girls, Katya, and her friend, girls I’d been sharing stories with were killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. Suddenly, the end-of-year party back in San Francisco felt obscene.\n\nThat’s when the power of the stories of technology changing the world for the better started dissolving. How could we pretend we’re “making the world a better place” when this was the reality children were facing, and this was a tiny glimpse into a world of hurt? That’s when the Silicon Valley religion of making the world a better place died for me.\n\nFor a couple of years after that, I was numb. I felt like the curtains had been pulled back, and I saw the show for what it was, (my) egocentricity and love for wealth and power disguised as a story about changing the world. Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion: mindfulness meditation. It promised peace in this life without worry, and I dove in wholeheartedly, seeking to escape my inner turmoil and loss of compass. \n\nIn 2013/2014, I would meditate every day for an hour in a park. One of these days, I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation, going ring by ring down my body, at some point, when I arrived at my groin, I felt like I was pierced by a sword, and I lept out of my cross-legged position and hobbled over to my bike, confused and in pain.\n\nBefore heading home, I checked my phone for directions home and saw that someone from Iraq had sent me an urgent message. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors' claims that the depleted uranium ammunition from the wars was resulting in increased cancer rates. The story of that adventure is for another time; this time, let’s focus on the phone message. \n\nIt was my friend's message asking for help that started a turnaround for me. I realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting people into trouble for doing “good work.” I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk I was invited to give, a lie… until, one day, I stood at the podium and blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled and nodded, looking at me pitifully. They must have known about Katya and the girls at Qah.\n\nAfter that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I grew increasingly insular, slept a lot, and often didn’t leave my house for days on end. My meditation practice wasn’t helping, I found greater distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, and what I felt as a growing comfort with numbness. Looking back, I can see that these were all symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I knew about PTSD, yet I didn’t realize that my experiences of car bombings in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones could have scarred me for years without ever being physically injured. \n\nOne day, while deep in the haze of trauma, sugar-coated with the equanimity of mindfulness, I met my future wife. In those days, I was at such a loss, I was “looking within” for guidance, working on accessing my intuition, reflecting on the world, and coming up with theories of change, attempting to understand the news, social media, open source technology, impact, goodness, etc. Yet I couldn’t figure it out. I was rejected from every fellowship I applied to from Harvard to the Bay and I was going in intellectual circles. \n\nWhen I met Josephine, I remember explicitly thinking to myself, “This time, I will listen to something else, no more ideas and explanations.” Logic had failed me thus far, and this time, something else spoke up. The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax, and a quiet voice said, “Yes.”\n\nThat was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning. In my life, I find this voice hard to listen to, and when I hear it - it’s been easy to ignore. Yet, finding that voice was like a light in the darkness. A calling to a different way of being in the world. One that seemed irrational and unlikely to make me famous or rich. One that told me to call my mom, and spend time in nature. A voice that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\nThese were the early days of healing for me. I realized I had to stop listening to myself and listen to something else, yet I didn’t know what my new path was. What was the voice? How could I know it was trustworthy? How would I explain it to my hyper-rational, reductionist friends?\n\nI realized that I wasn’t the only one who heard and followed these quiet voices. I found my people while listening to a podcast called OnBeing. I heard the stories of Jean Vanier and the church community he started in France for those with different abilities, and my frozen heart moved. Tears broke through the wall of numbness my meditation practice helped me build. It felt good, felt real, felt like I was seeing people follow the voice and shining a light on the path of beauty. I listened to almost every episode and it wasn’t until I heard Father Greg Boyle’s story that I felt like I found my next steps, my path of being that made sense.  \n\nFather Greg Boyle founded the Homeboy and Homegirl industries in Los Angeles. His organization supports recently freed prisoners in reintegration with jobs, tattoo removal, and providing a community of support. When they asked him why he does what he does, he didn’t say that “God told me to do it” or that “it’s the right thing to do,” nor did he say, “I want to make a positive dent in the world.” He said something so clear and simple, that it was as if he was speaking to me directly, he said they were his friends, so what else would he do?\n\nThis insight, that building and deepening relationships is a path to authentic action that doesn’t come with deliberation was liberating for me. It helped me see the importance of quality, care, and connection rather than the outputs: the lives saved, trees planted, jobs created… etc. \n\nOver the next few months, I mulled Father Boyle’s words over in my mind and by 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut. Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community was, and where the challenges of the Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nSaleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas. He was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp, and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. It was while he was hiding from the police at my house that decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas, we would host artists, journalists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.\n\nSlowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, a place for stories and connection. The house faced many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world, we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring. \n\nAs beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house, and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family, took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”\n\nI stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he was giving it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman my heart said yes to, the woman who loved me.\n\nBack then, I was too invested in the idea of having an impact. Living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability, and babies. That’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good,” even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships, I was ignoring something profound and deep, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regime, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the Muslim tradition, it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to their family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you, and somehow I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me. \n\nThis is when I finally started a more profound process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I was able to see that the Muslim tradition that I had left in Michigan so long ago had keys to a life in service to the quiet voice I found so hard to hear. By submitting my life to my sense of beauty, to the voice, and realized that that voice also left us many clues within us, in the world, and in the beautiful stories of the prophet and his Holy Book, the Quran. My relationship with submission to the divine could take a whole other book, let’s suffice it here to say that I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring. Finally, leaving the religion of progress, of what I thought goodness was, the religion that wants the self to leave a mark on the world, positive or not, made room for me to submit to a most Merciful God that is weaving the most beautiful story possible.\n\nIt was then that I finally started the long journey back to that moment in France. And so I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas in the capable hands of Saleh and friends. I flew to France to finally honor the commitment I’d kept in limbo—the commitment that opened the doors to baby Suleiman and that moment at the threshold of 2024, where I was holding my baby, feeling that all was just as it should be in this crazy world cradled in the hands of the most Merciful.\n\nThe first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc, and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wife and children, your parents, cousins, and high school friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, we just had a baby, and it's all come full circle that morning as I held baby Suli and cried, one eye overflowing with tears of sorrow… the other eye with tears of love.\"\"\"",

Yet I had forgotten about my family members killed during a war launched by lies about weapons of mass destruction. Suddenly, my work touched on global geopolitical issues I’d barely understood. I was a grain of sand in a vast dust storm.  \n> I started feeling uneasy. Once, I was interviewed on Al Jazeera and hailed as a “youth leader.” I left the call feeling proud—and that pride unsettled me. Who was I actually helping? Why was I helping anyone?  \n> My work took me around the world, including active conflict zones. After a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for children, I was stopped in my tracks. I heard story after story of brutal violence, yet these same people offered me food and shelter. I had brought solar-powered lights for a shadow-puppet workshop, thinking I could help. In truth, I was the one being helped—and days later, two beautiful seven-year-old girls, Katya and her friend, were killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. Suddenly, the glitzy end-of-year party back in San Francisco felt obscene.\n\n---\n\n## **Silicon Valley Religion Dies & Meditation Phase**\n\n**Original:**  \n> That’s when the power of stories of technology… Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> That’s when the power of the Silicon Valley story—“making the world a better place”—died for me. How could we say we were improving the world while children like Katya were being blown apart? For a couple of years, I was numb, as if the curtain had been pulled back. I saw my own egocentricity: wealth and power disguised as philanthropy. Unsure what else to do, I turned to another Silicon Valley fix: mindfulness meditation. It promised peace in this life, free from worry, and I dove in wholeheartedly, hoping to escape my turmoil and loss of compass.\n\n---\n\n## **Trauma, Pain, & Urgent Message**\n\n**Original:**  \n> In 2013/2014, I would meditate every day… we had brought open-source radiation sensors…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> In 2013 and 2014, I meditated every day in a park for an hour. One morning, as I scanned my body ring by ring, I felt a sudden, piercing pain when I reached my groin. I bolted upright, confused and hurting, and hobbled over to my bike.  \n> Checking my phone before heading home, I saw an urgent message from Iraq. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors’ claims that depleted uranium from the wars was causing higher cancer rates. That’s a story for another time. For now, let’s focus on the message.\n\n---\n\n## **Turning Point & “Stop Making Stuff”**\n\n**Original:**  \n> It was my friend's message asking for help… “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> My friend was asking for help, but I was far away—unable to do anything—and potentially getting people in trouble for what I thought was “good work.” I realized I was building communities yet never truly part of them. I no longer knew what “good” even looked like. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk a lie… until one day, I stood at a podium and blurted out, “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled and nodded, but I saw pity in their eyes—maybe they had heard about Katya and Qah.\n\n---\n\n## **Isolation & PTSD**\n\n**Original:**  \n> After that, the speaking agencies stopped calling… I knew about PTSD…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> After that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I withdrew, sleeping too much and rarely leaving my house. Meditation only distanced me from my feelings, and I grew comfortable in numbness. Looking back, these were classic symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious PTSD. I knew about PTSD, but I never realized that witnessing car bombings in Iraq, or losing people around me, could haunt me without physical wounds.\n\n---\n\n## **Meeting Josephine & the Quiet Voice**\n\n**Original:**  \n> One day, while deep in the haze… The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> One day, still lost in trauma and numbed by equanimity, I met my future wife. At the time, I was trying to “look within” for guidance, tinkering with theories of change, and applying to fellowships from Harvard to the Bay, all with no success. I was going in circles.  \n> When I met Josephine, I thought, *This time, I’ll listen to something else—no more ideas and explanations.* Logic had failed me, and in the moment I hugged her, my shoulders relaxed, and a quiet voice said, *Yes.*\n\n---\n\n## **Listening to the Voice of Beauty**\n\n**Original:**  \n> That was the first time I listened… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\n**Revised:**  \n> That was the first time I heeded the voice of deeper meaning. I often find it hard to hear, easy to ignore, but encountering it felt like a light in the darkness. It called me to a different way of being—one that seemed irrational, unlikely to make me rich or famous, but urged me to call my mom and spend time in nature. It wasn’t about leveraging the world to serve me; it was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\n---\n\n## **OnBeing, Greg Boyle, & New Path**\n\n**Original:**  \n> I realized I wasn’t the only one… I heard Father Greg Boyle’s story… He said they were his friends…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> In my early healing, I discovered I wasn’t alone in following such quiet voices. Listening to the OnBeing podcast, I heard stories of Jean Vanier and his community in France for people with different abilities. Tears broke through the numbness that meditation had allowed. It felt real and raw. Then I heard Father Greg Boyle’s story, and I finally saw my next steps.  \n> Father Greg Boyle founded Homeboy and Homegirl Industries in Los Angeles to support recently freed prisoners. When asked why he does what he does, he didn’t say “God told me” or “it’s the right thing”; he simply said they were his friends. So what else would he do?\n\n---\n\n## **Relationships & Rethinking “Change the World”**\n\n**Original:**  \n> This insight… that building and deepening relationships… was liberating…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> That insight—that building and deepening relationships is a path to authentic action—liberated me. It shifted my focus from outcomes (lives saved, trees planted, jobs created) to the quality of care and connection. Over the next few months, Father Boyle’s words stayed with me, and by 2016, I was on a plane to Beirut.  \n\n---\n\n## **Beit Al Atlas**\n\n**Original:**  \n> Beirut was where my friends… Saleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community hung out, and where the challenges faced by Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there we founded Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in refugee camps.  \n> Saleh, my cofounder, was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp and had led a tough life until we met. It was while he hid from the police at my house that we decided to start Beit Al Atlas. We hosted artists, journalists, international visitors, and, for whatever reason, many Danes. Early mornings, the house filled with the smell of coffee and the sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our resident from India, brewed coffee for everyone.\n\n---\n\n## **Ahmed’s Ring & Realizing Priorities**\n\n**Original:**  \n> Slowly, the house became a home… That’s when I realized I was using my life as an instrument…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> Slowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for Syrian refugees polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, for stories and connection. We faced plenty of struggles, yet through our diverse community and love, we always found enough support for rent and coffee.  \n> As beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself. Josephine wanted me to live with her, marry her, and start a family. She’d visit, and at some point, Ahmed—a Syrian refugee who became part of our family—took off his ring and offered it to me, saying, *“Bilal, give this ring to Josephine. Enough already—go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”*  \n> I stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s wages for him, yet he wanted me to do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman who loved me, the woman my heart said “yes” to.\n\n---\n\n## **Submission & Returning to France**\n\n**Original:**  \n> That’s when I realized… This is when I finally started a more profound process of submission…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> Back then, I was too tied to the idea of “impact.” Living in Beirut, building this house—wasn’t that more important than love, stability, and babies? I finally saw that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, even a “good” one, while ignoring something profound: the one who loved me. Ahmed, who fled Syria at eleven after his father was shot, helped me see it. In the Muslim tradition, the best charity is to one’s family; those nearest to you deserve the most of you. Yet I was committing my life to my wonderful friends and leaving Josephine alone in France.  \n> That’s when I started a deeper process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I realized that the Muslim tradition I’d drifted from in Michigan held keys to serving that quiet voice. By submitting to a sense of beauty, by accepting the signs in ourselves, in the world, and in the stories of the prophet and the Quran, I began leaving the “religion” of progress. A religion that demanded leaving a mark on the world—positive or not—gave way to faith in a merciful God, weaving the most beautiful story possible.  \n> I finally began the long journey back to that moment in France. I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas with Saleh and friends, and flew to France to honor the commitment I’d left in limbo. That opened the door to baby Suleiman and, at the threshold of 2024, to holding my baby and feeling that all was just as it should be in this crazy world cradled by the Most Merciful.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**Original:**  \n> The first step was scary… build a loving home with my wife…\n\n**Revised:**  \n> The first step was terrifying. I had to let go of my identity as someone who went wherever things were hardest— Iraq, Syria, Palestine—to build communities in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to ever greater heights, usually meaning more distance from ourselves, our wives, children, parents, cousins, and old friends, I’ve been working to slowly reintegrate. I’m building a loving home with my wife, and we just had a baby. It’s all come full circle to that morning when I held baby Suli and cried: one eye overflowing with sorrow for the world’s pain, the other eye full of love for the child in my arms.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note**\n\nThese paragraph-level edits preserve **your voice, tone, and phrasing** wherever possible, while removing minor redundancies or clarifying meaning.

      "content": "Ok, one last time, does it feel finished, what would a professional editor say while keeping my style?\n\"\"\"How I stopped making the world a better place, and started to love my baby.\nOne day, I held my 6-month-old baby, his soft face against my chest. Early morning light streamed through the windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, the future uncertain, war raging in Palestine—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This one moment is enough for a life.\nThat quiet morning, though, was the failure of my earlier life. During my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016), in elite circles discussing life extension or pitches, no one seemed to value a simple life, and it seemed no one had babies. We were too busy hustling to make a dent in the universe, to make the world better (and ourselves richer, I guess). We were digital magicians, using technology to augment human power without thought to human will.\n\nWhatever we were doing, it worked. By some strange sort of retribution and luck, we nerds started getting rich for the same traits that led to us being bullied in high school. In that bubble, Marc Andreesen’s prophecy that “software would eat the world” felt more like a battle cry than the warning it should have been. We devoured his essays, wrote code to cut repetitive tasks, and started businesses to solve any friction we saw—and it “worked”.\n\nIn my Muslim household in Michigan, I was raised to believe this life was just a test, yet everything I learned crashing the country's elite technical university, MIT, was telling me the world was understandable, malleable, and ours to shape.\n\nMany of my college friends went on to leave their mark on the world, start businesses, build satellite technology, or get jobs at Google. Making money was a sign that they did something valuable, and thus the richer some of us got, the more we all believed they were on the right path. We knew that knowledge is power, innovation is king, and by our collective guidance, humanity is destined for the stars. \n\nDriven by that optimism, I launched my first maker space in Michigan and a robotics company, soon, validated by dollars in the bank, I would be blessed for participating in the appropriate acts of worship, value creation, and problem-solving for abstract people. My value system in those days was “If we can, we should.” I believed that we were gaining the ability to create whatever we could imagine, that the more people from around the world would join us that this would surely lead to our collective future of flourishing. As those ideas were developing, news of the Arab Spring filled me and young Arabs around the world with hope — and a new idea started taking shape. \n\nWith the hackerspace growing at home and the robotics company having launched our factory robot I believed we could replicate this energy abroad. That’s how I came to found the Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), to take the ideas I learned at MIT and Silicon Valley (or was it a religion?) “back home” to Iraq and South West Asia and North African (SWANA) more broadly. \n\nI started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa, the thought was to infect people with transmissible ideas by giving them a direct experience of innovation hubs. In those days, the Arab Spring was still young, and people were excited to see a youth movement topple authoritarian regimes. Growing up as an Iraqi American, I remember hushed conversations in my family’s living room, stories of how a so and so had vanished after a stray comment about the government shared with only direct family members. It led me to believe that direct opposition to the leadership was not an intelligent way forward for the movement. Taking what I learned from Silicon Valley, I suggested that instead of asking for a different future - we should build it. \n\nSeeing a young Iraqi American say that Iraq could have a beautiful future if its young people gathered together in spaces, collaborating, innovating, and starting businesses was an appealing idea for people around the world, and I received recognition and support. That recognition was enough to fuel me; I was on the right path; fame and glory, and probably money too, was soon to be mine. Yet somehow, I had forgotten the stories of my family members killed during a war now recognized internationally as being started by a deliberate lie about weapons of mass destruction. My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of, and I was a grain of sand swirling around in a dust storm. \n\nI promised a beautiful vision of the world, a grassroots rag-tag team of technology-powered super-hackers out to build a better future, car bombs or no car bombs. Back then, the reality of how power, money, and conflict were interrelated was invisible to me. \n\nAll I knew was that I started feeling uneasy. Once, while I was being interviewed on Al Jazeera and highlighted as a “youth leader,” I left the call feeling proud, and that pride made me uneasy. What the heck was I doing? Who was I really helping? Why was I trying to help anyone? \n\nMy work took me around the world, including active conflict areas, and it was after a trip to a refugee camp in Qah, Syria, where I was working on a storytelling project for young children that stopped me in my tracks. I heard story after story of [[[censored for your sanity]]]. Yet those same people who experienced so much violence offered me food and shelter. I had brought solar-powered lights for a shadow puppet workshop, thinking I could be helpful. In truth, I was the one being helped—yet days later, two beautiful seven-year-old girls, Katya, and her friend, girls I’d been sharing stories with were killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. Suddenly, the end-of-year party back in San Francisco felt obscene.\n\nThat’s when the power of the stories of technology changing the world for the better started dissolving. How could we pretend we’re “making the world a better place” when this was the reality children were facing, and this was a tiny glimpse into a world of hurt? That’s when the Silicon Valley religion of making the world a better place died for me.\n\nFor a couple of years after that, I was numb. I felt like the curtains had been pulled back, and I saw the show for what it was, (my) egocentricity and love for wealth and power disguised as a story about changing the world. Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion: mindfulness meditation. It promised peace in this life without worry, and I dove in wholeheartedly, seeking to escape my inner turmoil and loss of compass. \n\nIn 2013/2014, I would meditate every day for an hour in a park. One of these days, I found that as I was doing my body scan meditation, going ring by ring down my body, at some point, when I arrived at my groin, I felt like I was pierced by a sword, and I lept out of my cross-legged position and hobbled over to my bike, confused and in pain.\n\nBefore heading home, I checked my phone for directions home and saw that someone from Iraq had sent me an urgent message. Back in 2013, working with [redacted], we had brought open-source radiation sensors to validate Iraqi doctors' claims that the depleted uranium ammunition from the wars was resulting in increased cancer rates. The story of that adventure is for another time; this time, let’s focus on the phone message. \n\nIt was my friend's message asking for help that started a turnaround for me. I realized that I was far away, unable to help, and getting people into trouble for doing “good work.” I realized that I was creating communities, yet not a part of any of them. I wasn’t even sure what good looked like anymore. Every Silicon Valley salon felt hollow, every hackathon pointless, every talk I was invited to give, a lie… until, one day, I stood at the podium and blurted out: “Stop Making Stuff, Start Making Sense.” The audience smiled and nodded, looking at me pitifully. They must have known about Katya and the girls at Qah.\n\nAfter that, the speaking agencies stopped calling. I grew increasingly insular, slept a lot, and often didn’t leave my house for days on end. My meditation practice wasn’t helping, I found greater distance from my feelings, a lack of desire, and what I felt as a growing comfort with numbness. Looking back, I can see that these were all symptoms of undiagnosed vicarious Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I knew about PTSD, yet I didn’t realize that my experiences of car bombings in Iraq, the deaths around me, and living/working in war zones could have scarred me for years without ever being physically injured. \n\nOne day, while deep in the haze of trauma, sugar-coated with the equanimity of mindfulness, I met my future wife. In those days, I was at such a loss, I was “looking within” for guidance, working on accessing my intuition, reflecting on the world, and coming up with theories of change, attempting to understand the news, social media, open source technology, impact, goodness, etc. Yet I couldn’t figure it out. I was rejected from every fellowship I applied to from Harvard to the Bay and I was going in intellectual circles. \n\nWhen I met Josephine, I remember explicitly thinking to myself, “This time, I will listen to something else, no more ideas and explanations.” Logic had failed me thus far, and this time, something else spoke up. The moment I hugged Josephine, I felt my shoulders relax, and a quiet voice said, “Yes.”\n\nThat was the first time I listened to the voice of deeper meaning. In my life, I find this voice hard to listen to, and when I hear it - it’s been easy to ignore. Yet, finding that voice was like a light in the darkness. A calling to a different way of being in the world. One that seemed irrational and unlikely to make me famous or rich. One that told me to call my mom, and spend time in nature. A voice that wasn’t about understanding the world and leveraging it to serve me… one that was about submitting to the calling of beauty.\n\nThese were the early days of healing for me. I realized I had to stop listening to myself and listen to something else, yet I didn’t know what my new path was. What was the voice? How could I know it was trustworthy? How would I explain it to my hyper-rational, reductionist friends?\n\nI realized that I wasn’t the only one who heard and followed these quiet voices. I found my people while listening to a podcast called OnBeing. I heard the stories of Jean Vanier and the church community he started in France for those with different abilities, and my frozen heart moved. Tears broke through the wall of numbness my meditation practice helped me build. It felt good, felt real, felt like I was seeing people follow the voice and shining a light on the path of beauty. I listened to almost every episode and it wasn’t until I heard Father Greg Boyle’s story that I felt like I found my next steps, my path of being that made sense.  \n\nFather Greg Boyle founded the Homeboy and Homegirl industries in Los Angeles. His organization supports recently freed prisoners in reintegration with jobs, tattoo removal, and providing a community of support. When they asked him why he does what he does, he didn’t say that “God told me to do it” or that “it’s the right thing to do,” nor did he say, “I want to make a positive dent in the world.” He said something so clear and simple, that it was as if he was speaking to me directly, he said they were his friends, so what else would he do?\n\nThis insight, that building and deepening relationships is a path to authentic action that doesn’t come with deliberation was liberating for me. It helped me see the importance of quality, care, and connection rather than the outputs: the lives saved, trees planted, jobs created… etc. \n\nOver the next few months, I mulled Father Boyle’s words over in my mind and by 2016, I found myself on a plane to Beirut. Beirut was where my friends and I would play music late into the night, where my nerd community was, and where the challenges of the Syrian refugees were most intense. It was there that we started Beit Al Atlas, a house for connecting people across social and economic differences. I lived and served there, hosting dinners, holding space, and teaching in the refugee camps.\n\nSaleh is the cofounder of Beit Al Atlas. He was born in a Syrian Palestinian refugee camp, and he had led a tough life up until we met in the refugee camps of Beirut. It was while he was hiding from the police at my house that decided to start Beit Al Atlas. At Beit Al Atlas, we would host artists, journalists, international journalists, and for whatever reason, many people from Denmark. Early mornings the house would fill with the smell of coffee and the melodious sounds of Fairuz as Shantanu, our international resident from India, would make coffee for the house.\n\nSlowly, the house became a home for Saleh and me, a garden for the Syrian refugees who worked polishing shoes on our doorstep, a place for book clubs and dinners, and most importantly, a place for stories and connection. The house faced many struggles, yet through our diversity and connections through love with people around the world, we always found enough support to keep the doors open and the coffee pouring. \n\nAs beautiful as Beit Al Atlas was, I still hadn’t aligned myself properly. When I moved to Beirut, Josephine had been wanting me to live with her, to marry her, to start a family together. She would visit the house, and at some point, Ahmed, one of the Syrian refugees who became part of our family, took off one of his rings and gave it to me, saying: Bilal, give this ring to Josephine to give to you. Enough already, go get married and make babies. There’s nothing in life more beautiful.”\n\nI stared at that ring. It was maybe a week’s worth of earnings for him. Yet he was giving it to me so I could do the simplest, most important thing: marry the woman my heart said yes to, the woman who loved me.\n\nBack then, I was too invested in the idea of having an impact. Living in Beirut and building this house was more important than love, stability, and babies. That’s when I realized that I was using my life as an instrument for an idea, and even if that idea was “good,” even if Saleh was my friend, even if the house was authentically building beautiful and unlikely cross-cultural relationships, I was ignoring something profound and deep, I was ignoring the one who loves me. Ahmed helped me see that, even though he left Syria when he was 11 after his father was shot by the Asad regime, even though he speaks with a lisp - a potential mark of deep trauma, he helped me see the beautiful thing to do. In the Muslim tradition, it’s said that the best charity is the charity one gives to their family, it’s said that those who are nearest to you deserve the most of you, and somehow I was committing my life to beautiful friends, yet leaving alone and sad in France the person who wants to start a family with me. \n\nThis is when I finally started a more profound process of submission. Through Ahmed’s guidance, I was able to see that the Muslim tradition that I had left in Michigan so long ago had keys to a life in service to the quiet voice I found so hard to hear. By submitting my life to my sense of beauty, to the voice, and realized that that voice also left us many clues within us, in the world, and in the beautiful stories of the prophet and his Holy Book, the Quran. My relationship with submission to the divine could take a whole other book, let’s suffice it here to say that I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring. Finally, leaving the religion of progress, of what I thought goodness was, the religion that wants the self to leave a mark on the world, positive or not, made room for me to submit to a most Merciful God that is weaving the most beautiful story possible.\n\nIt was then that I finally started the long journey back to that moment in France. And so I packed my bags, leaving Beit Al Atlas in the capable hands of Saleh and friends. I flew to France to finally honor the commitment I’d kept in limbo—the commitment that opened the doors to baby Suleiman and that moment at the threshold of 2024, where I was holding my baby, feeling that all was just as it should be in this crazy world cradled in the hands of the most Merciful.\n\nThe first step was scary. I had to let go of my identity as someone who goes where the difficulties are, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, etc, and works to build community and create beauty in unexpected places. In a world that pushes us to greater heights, usually implying further and further distance from yourself, your wife and children, your parents, cousins, and high school friends, I've been working to slowly reintegrate myself with myself, build a loving home with my wife, we just had a baby, and it's all come full circle that morning as I held baby Suli and cried, one eye overflowing with tears of sorrow… the other eye with tears of love.\"\"\"",

I’ve quoted and paraphrased sections to highlight suggested tweaks.\n\n---\n\n## **Overall Assessment**\n\nYou’ve crafted a deeply personal, sweeping narrative that intertwines global geopolitics, entrepreneurial ambition, personal faith, love, and family. The piece is emotionally resonant, and you do a great job of bringing the reader into specific, pivotal moments—holding your baby, leaving Silicon Valley, hosting refugees in Beirut, and so on. The primary areas a professional editor might hone in on are:\n\n1. **Consistency of Tone and Tense**  \n2. **Tightening Wordiness or Repetitive Phrases**  \n3. **Maintaining Focus on Key Themes** (especially near the end)  \n4. **Ensuring a Smooth Pacing** so that each transition feels natural.\n\nYou’re close to a finished piece, but a final polish will help ensure every sentence carries weight without losing your reflective, authentic voice.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Strengthen or Rework Your Title Slightly**\n\n- **Current Title**: *How I stopped making the world a better place, and started to love my baby.*  \n- **Suggestion**: Shorten or sharpen for clarity and impact. For example:\n  - *“How I Stopped Fixing the World and Learned to Love My Baby”*  \n  - *“Why I Stopped ‘Changing the World’ to Love My Baby Instead”*  \n  - Or even the simpler, *“Loving My Baby Instead of Fixing the World.”*  \n\nA slightly more concise title can give your story a cleaner introduction.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Keep the Opening Scene Tight and Poignant**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“One day, I held my 6-month-old baby… This one moment is enough for a life.”*\n\n- **Commendation**: Lovely description that sets the emotional tone.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: You might further tighten it to maintain focus on the pivotal realization:\n\n  > *One day, I held my 6-month-old baby, his soft face against my chest. Early morning light poured through our windows, painting the walls orange. In that instant—his tiny hand on mine, war raging in Palestine, the future uncertain—I felt a wave of awe. I remember crying and thinking: This one moment is enough for a life.*\n\nThis keeps it concise while retaining your style and emotional pull.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Smooth Out the Transition to Silicon Valley**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“That quiet morning… was the failure of my earlier life… During my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016)…”*\n\n- **Commendation**: Contrasting your serene present moment with a fast-paced, “failing” past is effective.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: If the phrase “was the failure of my earlier life” feels too abrupt or negative, consider a softer lead-in:\n\n  > *That quiet morning stood in stark contrast to my Silicon Valley years (2012–2016)…*\n\nThis avoids labeling your entire past as a “failure,” which might jar some readers. Instead, let the reader discover how it felt like a personal failing to you.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Maintain a Steady Narrative Flow in the Tech & Entrepreneurship Sections**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“Whatever we were doing, it worked… We devoured [Marc Andreessen’s] essays… wrote code to cut repetitive tasks…”*\n\n- **Commendation**: Great snapshot of Silicon Valley culture.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: Occasionally, you use parentheses or asides that can break the flow. Instead of:  \n  > *…at MIT and Silicon Valley (or was it a religion?)…*  \n  Try weaving that phrase directly into the sentence:\n\n  > *…at MIT and Silicon Valley—both of which felt more like a religion than a place…*\n\nThis keeps your style (lightly humorous, introspective) but reads more smoothly.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Highlight the Key Moment of Dissonance More Clearly**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“I started in Egypt with Maker Faire Africa… My work started involving me in global geopolitical issues I was dimly aware of…”*\n\n- **Commendation**: You show a clear shift from local entrepreneurship to global activism.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: Consider adding one short, vivid anecdote or snippet (e.g., a conversation in Egypt) before moving on to bigger geopolitical realizations. This grounds the reader in a tangible moment and keeps momentum steady.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Qah Refugee Camp & Emotional Turn**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“…two beautiful seven-year-old girls, Katya, and her friend… were killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school… the party back in San Francisco felt obscene.”*\n\n- **Commendation**: This is the emotional core, and you convey it powerfully.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: A final polish might streamline extraneous words so the heartbreak lands more squarely:\n\n  > *When I returned to San Francisco from Qah, I learned that two beautiful seven-year-old girls—Katya and her friend—had been killed when the Assad regime bombed their makeshift school. Suddenly, the end-of-year party felt obscene.*\n\nThat slight condensing can intensify the emotional impact.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Mindfulness as a Second “Religion”**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“…Not knowing what to do, I joined another Silicon Valley religion: mindfulness meditation.”*\n\n- **Commendation**: Great metaphor, tying the theme of “religion” to different belief systems (tech, mindfulness, progress, etc.).  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: Make sure that each “religion” reference doesn’t feel repetitive; ensure you’re adding insight each time you compare one to another. If it’s essential to your personal journey, keep it, but watch out for over-using the same rhetorical device.\n\n---\n\n## **8. The Body Scan & PTSD Moment**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“…I felt like I was pierced by a sword… I lept out of my cross-legged position…”*\n\n- **Commendation**: Very vivid. Shows the physical manifestation of trauma.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: You might add a short internal monologue or emotional reaction (even just one line) to further ground the reader:\n\n  > *My mind raced: “What just happened? Why am I in this much pain?”*\n\nThis quick reaction helps readers feel your confusion and fear in real time.\n\n---\n\n## **9. Introducing Josephine & the “Quiet Voice”**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“When I met Josephine… I felt my shoulders relax… a quiet voice said ‘Yes.’”*\n\n- **Commendation**: Beautifully simple. It marks a stark contrast from your anxiety and rational approach.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: The phrase “this time I will listen to something else” is powerful. Perhaps expand *slightly* on your internal shift. Just a sentence or two is enough to connect your newfound openness to the moment you first embrace Josephine.\n\n---\n\n## **10. Integrating the OnBeing & Father Boyle References**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“…it wasn’t until I heard Father Greg Boyle’s story that I felt like I found my next steps…”*\n\n- **Commendation**: You keep the story from OnBeing and Father Boyle concise but meaningful.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: Since you also mention Jean Vanier, ensure the references don’t stack up too heavily. A single line referencing Jean Vanier is enough before pivoting to Father Boyle, who clearly has the bigger impact on you.\n\n---\n\n## **11. Beit Al Atlas & Ahmed’s Generosity**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“…Ahmed took off one of his rings… Enough already, go get married… I stared at that ring…”*\n\n- **Commendation**: This is a highlight—gives a real human face to your shift in priorities.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: It’s already a strong scene. You might emphasize your immediate internal reaction with one or two more lines of reflection:  \n\n  > *I stared at the ring, speechless. A week’s worth of earnings, offered so effortlessly. In that moment, my priorities flipped again.*\n\nThis cements the emotional turning point.\n\n---\n\n## **12. Faith, Submission, and Personal Revelation**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“…By submitting my life to my sense of beauty… I started seeing the deeper wisdom in a tradition I had been ignoring…”*\n\n- **Commendation**: You describe your spiritual pivot with heartfelt sincerity.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: The word “submission” can be loaded for some readers. You might briefly clarify how it felt to you:\n\n  > *This was not blind obedience, but a gentle yielding to the quiet voice of beauty and faith…*\n\nOne short clarifying line can help the general reader understand “submission” in the context of your personal growth, rather than misinterpret it.\n\n---\n\n## **13. Final Paragraph & Full Circle with the Baby**\n\n### **Excerpt**  \n> *“…we just had a baby, and it’s all come full circle… one eye overflowing with tears of sorrow… the other eye with tears of love.”*\n\n- **Commendation**: A touching conclusion that mirrors your opening—powerful and poetic.  \n- **Professional Editor Tip**: Resist adding extra commentary after such a strong, visual ending. Let that image linger in the reader’s mind. If you do want to expand by one more line, keep it minimal, e.g.:\n\n  > *In that moment, I realized this was the life I’d been seeking all along.*\n\nThis reaffirms your journey’s resolution.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Thoughts**\n\nA professional editor would likely say your narrative is nearly there: you’ve done the hard work of weaving global experiences, personal introspection, and a moral/spiritual evolution into a cohesive story. A final pass should focus on:\n\n1. **Condensing or removing words where the story feels even slightly repetitive or tangential.**  \n2. **Ensuring transitions between paragraphs are smooth**—especially when jumping between places (Michigan, Egypt, Beirut) or concepts (tech religion, mindfulness, and Islam).  \n3. **Keeping the ending succinct** so the emotional resonance doesn’t get diluted by extra explanation.\n\nYou’ve got a compelling, heartfelt piece that shows your journey from chasing big ambitions to cherishing the profound simplicity of loving and caring for your baby—without sacrificing the depth of your global experiences. With one more editorial polish, you’ll have a final draft that is both stylistically consistent and powerfully evocative.",

      "content": "Here’s a rewrite using your reflections to deepen the section while keeping your voice and style intact:\n\n---\n\nI was searching for things that made my heart sing. My spiritual path was rocky, but one day, I decided to focus on what I deeply believed: that God is beautiful and loves beauty. I chose to use my life to follow a path of beauty. If I died and there was no God, at least I would have lived a beautiful life. And if He did exist, I trusted He would love me for that.  \n\nThat’s what led me to Krista Tippett’s podcast, *On Being*. I was hungry for stories that illuminated the beauty humans are capable of—the selflessness, the care, the inspiration that moves us to connection and goodness. When I heard Jean Vanier’s story of creating communities for people with disabilities, something cracked open in me. His love and service weren’t forced or strategic; they were natural, flowing from a place of deep humanity. For the first time in a long time, I felt moved by what humans could do—not through ambition or design, but through love.\n\nAnd then I cried. It was the first time I’d touched parts of myself that still felt human, after years of numbness. I didn’t just feel alive again—I felt inspired to see beauty that could move me to tears.  \n\nI devoured almost every episode of the podcast, but it wasn’t until I heard Father Greg Boyle’s story that I found my next steps, a path of being that finally made sense. Father Greg, the founder of Homeboy and Homegirl Industries, helps recently freed prisoners reintegrate with jobs, tattoo removal, and a community of support. When asked why he does what he does, he didn’t say it was because “God told me to” or “It’s the right thing to do,” or even that “he wanted to make the world better.” Instead, he simply said, “They’re my friends. So what else would I do?”\n\nHis answer stopped me cold. It wasn’t about setting some future intention—how the world could or should be better—or striving to achieve a goal, even if that goal was good. He wasn’t waiting for his relationships to pay off in some tangible way or seeking validation in how proud he might feel about his work. It wasn’t transactional, and it wasn’t about making a dent in the universe. He was just responding authentically to the only moment that’s real—the one he was living in.  \n\nThat immediacy, that way of being a friend rather than making friends, showed me something profound. Beautiful actions emerge from that authenticity, without the tangle of intentions or expectations. It wasn’t about outcomes, cause and effect, or the uncertainty of future rewards. It was simply about being present, and in that presence, beauty could unfold.\n\nAt the time, I was stuck in my head, trying to rationally figure out what a “good intention” even was. Father Boyle’s story freed me from that spiral. It wasn’t about getting the intention right—it was about living beautifully in the moment, letting those intentions dissolve into the act itself.  \n\n---\n\nThis version reflects your spiritual journey, the emotional impact of the stories, and your realization about the immediacy of love and action. It’s infused with your perspective while remaining clear and connected. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to refine!",
