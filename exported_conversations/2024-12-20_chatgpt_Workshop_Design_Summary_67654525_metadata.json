Like, for example, I'm a bridge diver, and I kind of want to quantify the performance of small crabs to allow them to properly develop their own design thinking framework, and maybe even show them how they can use these techniques that are out there, and how, you know, that's like another one of the challenges of following the framework and thinking about it. And I think it's important to follow frameworks, not only to do things, but also to quantify them. You know, you can do small things, and really, like, one of these principle frameworks, you know, if you love, you don't just build something random, you build something out of care, right? And if you are seeking the truth, this is where we can get to these ideas of, like, what's the real problem here? Where am I really solving this problem? And this idea that there is and validating it for its life and all of that, and all of that comes with the truth. You can do this, you can do that, right? Like, you can equal that, and on top, you can do this, right? That, right? It's the God, experience, knowledge, and you're trying to create, right? And then, you know, like, there are also values, and there are values if and when things are beautiful to you, to others. You know, beauty is also something that saves. We can talk about how, you know, this Paris Burning has this documentary, a story about the German soldier who was ordered to blow up a big portion of Paris, and he just couldn't get himself to do it because it was just so beautiful. And if only we can expand people, people's eyes to see how beautiful nature is, you know, and to, through that, build love, and from love, there's the action, right? The action part of the doing needs some emotion and feeling, and it's sort of unfolds, right?

They can kind of be a little bit specific, you know, and they can just put their name, and then write which forms of capital they have, how it shows up in their life or something, and how can they contribute and share it if they need.
