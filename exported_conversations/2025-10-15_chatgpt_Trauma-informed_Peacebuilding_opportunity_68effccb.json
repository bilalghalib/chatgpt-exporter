Call for Tenders - Trauma-informed Peacebuilding\nThe Academy for Conflict Transformation, part of Pro Peace, is looking for a trainer to develop and deliver a five-week thematic online training on the topic of “Trauma-informed Peacebuilding”, scheduled for April 2026.\nApplication Deadline: 22.10.2025\n1. Background information\nThe Academy for Conflict Transformation has been a learning place for peace and conflict work since 1997. Our training program is aimed both at professionals in this field who want to deepen their skills, as well as experts in related fields who want to make their work more conflict-sensitive. To date, around 4,000 people have participated in our courses and trainings. Through their contributions to the non-violent transformation of conflicts, our participants reaffirm our belief that constructive conflict transformation can be taught and learned.\nIn our courses and trainings, we combine theory and practice. Through exchanges between people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, our participants explore how fundamental concepts can be put into practice. Here, current discourses and methods in the fields of peace research and conflict transformation meet the practical experiences of the participants. We pursue a participatory and holistic training approach. Self-reflection, an examination of one's inner attitude and one's own understanding of one's role are also an essential part of this. \nParticipants are accompanied by our trainers, who, in addition to their pedagogical skills, have in-depth practical experience and theoretical expertise in conflict transformation.\nThe Academy is part of the international non-profit organisation Pro Peace. Founded in 1996, Pro Peace fosters nonviolent conflict transformation and paves paths towards a more just and peaceful future. Pro Peace is today active in 13 countries and is a government-recognized member of the Civil Peace Service (CPS) and a signatory of the Transparent Civil Society Initiative.\nThe Academy’s portfolio consists of longer, comprehensive training courses in peace and conflict work as well as shorter trainings focused on specific topics – both as in-person and online. Furthermore, we offer specific exchange platforms for alumni and orientation trainings for people interested in the Civil Peace Service (CPS). The Academy also offers tailor-made trainings in the field of peace and conflict transformation.\n2. Training description\nWith the thematic online trainings, the Academy aims to reach peacebuilders who want to expand and deepen their existing knowledge through specialized topics in the field of peace and conflict work. These trainings are designed to allow participation alongside a regular job and from a variety of locations around the world. The majority of the participants are active in peacebuilding and already have knowledge on basic theories around peace and conflict. \nAs in previous years, the Academy would like to conduct training courses on trauma-informed peace and conflict work again. This training aims to provide peace workers with tools for understanding the significance of trauma in conflict contexts and dealing with it. Since this topic poses particular challenges in terms of facilitation and support of a diverse group of participants, we are looking for a trainer tandem (please also see section 5 of this call). After the training, participants should at least have accomplished the following learning objectives. \nParticipants…\n\t•\t…understand the key terms of a trauma-informed approach and recognize patterns of common behavior to traumatic events,\n\t•\t...know about collective and transgenerational trauma and how this may impact the societies they work in,\n\t•\t…learned concrete tools and exercises that help them in working with people who have been exposed to traumatic experiences,\n\t•\t…understand the relevance and have ideas on how to integrate a trauma-informed approach in conflict analysis and project planning,\n\t•\t...are aware of their personal and professional boundaries when dealing with trauma.\nThe planned schedule is five weeks of training with one four-hour live sessions per week. Between the live sessions, the participants will work independently and together with others on provided material (literature, podcasts, videos or similar). The training aims to be as hands-on-oriented as possible and to be embedded in the context of the participants. However, the weekly workload for the participants in addition to the live sessions should be about 3-4 hours. \nThe Academy for Conflict Transformation promotes an interactive, varied and playful learning environment and exchange-oriented communication of content in the digital space. In addition to input from the trainer, the exchange of ideas among the participants, for example in group work and discussions, is also crucial and a valuable resource. We emphasize a warm, encouraging, trusting and appreciating atmosphere in this online setting. The facilitator’s and the participants’ expertise constitute key components of our trainings. The Academy is aware of different power structures and considers it in the designing of the content and the training. Together with the trainers, we are striving to create a room when needed, where related thoughts and concerns are discussable. \nTo ensure a productive exchange on both a professional and personal level, the target number of participants is 16 people. If there are any changes in this regard, the trainer will be notified in a timely manner.\nOur online thematic trainings are conducted on the learning platform ILIAS. For the live sessions we use BigBlueButton. This virtual learning space is only open to participants and the facilitator.\n3. Deliverables\nThe trainer shall perform an online thematic training (preparing, holding and follow-up) and is responsible for designing and accompanying both the synchronous and asynchronous parts of the learning process, supported by and in agreement with the Academy’s team. This includes the following tasks:\n\nConceptualization and preparation of the training\n\n\t•\tProviding information on the training for the acquisition of participants\n\t•\tDepending on the needs at least one consultation with the Academy’s educational advisor on the tools used during the training. After a detailed briefing we expect the facilitator to be able to use these platforms independently.\n\t•\tProviding the content for the different modules on the learning platform and designing the tasks and deliverables for participants to invest 3-4 hours weekly in the training in regular consultation with the educational advisor\n\t•\tThe detailed and updated training outline shall be sent to the educational advisor four weeks before the start\n\nImplementation of the training\n\n\t•\tIndependent facilitation of the live sessions and preparation thereof\n\t•\tFeedback to participants’ deliverables and contributions \n\t•\tCreating a safe space in the online environment\n\t•\tAdapting the training to participants’ needs and the learning process\n\t•\tFriendly and responsive communication with the participants\n\nEvaluation of the training\n\n\t•\tOne last evaluative meeting with the educational advisor or a written report\nThe Academy for Conflict Transformation supports the methodical and content-related organization and is responsible for the advertising of the training, done in cooperation with the facilitator. It also provides the technical infrastructure for the training (e.g. access to the learning platform ILIAS and the video conferencing tool BigBlueButton). Additional software and platforms, such as interactive whiteboards or brainstorming tools, can be used and offered by the Academy if agreed to in advance. Furthermore, we provide the trainer with information on participants’ experience and expectations before the start of the training. The educational advisor is always available for consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Requirements to apply and assessment procedure\nThe following seven criteria have to be fulfilled:\n\t1\tSubstantial knowledge of the theory of the training subject\n\t2\tRelevant hands-on experience in areas related to the training subject\n\t3\tSubstantial experience as a trainer and/or in adult education in transcultural contexts\n\t4\tStrong communication skills, ability to recognize and respond to participants’ needs, willingness to implement constructive feedback\n\t5\tPrevious experience with online learning processes, dynamic and interactive online tools and the creation of safe spaces in the virtual environment.\n\t6\tExcellent skills of the training language (English)\n\t7\tBeing aware of various power relations and one’s own role as well as taking an anti-racist stance\n5. Assessment procedure\nThe selection will be done in line with the following criteria:\nQualification and Experience (Weight: 40%)\nQuality of the Concept (Weight: 60%)\n6. Fees\n\nThe Academy offers a daily rate of 650 € (excl. VAT). Since we recommend conducting the training with two trainers in this case, we offer a daily fee of 1,000 € for a trainer tandem. This training implies five daily rates (preparation, implementation, evaluation).\n7. Submission of proposals\n\nThe proposals should include:\n\n\t•\tA CV\n\t•\tA cover letter explaining your motivation and working approaches, including information on availability\n\t•\tA training concept and outline (see Annex 1)\nPlease submit all documents in English. \n",

      "content": "Short answer:\n\n- **Pay:**  \n  - Solo trainer: **€650/day × 5 days = €3,250 (excl. VAT)**.  \n  - Trainer tandem: **€1,000/day × 5 days = €5,000 total** (typically **~€2,500 each**, confirm whether that’s split or per trainer).\n\n- **Should you do it?**  \n  **Yes—strong fit.** Your PTG thesis + years facilitating trauma-aware, peace/entrepreneurship programs online and across MENA line up with every requirement. If you don’t want to hold clinical material alone, pair with a clinician or somatic therapist and you handle pedagogy, intercultural facilitation, and curriculum.\n\n---\n\n### Why you’re a match (fast checklist)\n- **Theory + practice:** Post-traumatic growth research; years designing hands-on curricula and online bootcamps.\n- **Adult ed in transcultural contexts:** Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine, etc.; 4-hour live blocks are your wheelhouse.\n- **Interactive online training:** You already run playful, participatory sessions; can adapt to ILIAS/BBB easily.\n- **Power awareness / anti-racist stance:** Embedded in your pedagogy and program design.\n- **English fluency + strong comms:** ✅\n\n### Gaps & how to cover them\n- **Clinical depth:** Team up with a trauma clinician/somatic practitioner for safety, grounding, and scope-of-practice clarity.\n- **Time vs. fee:** Five “daily rates” must cover prep, 5×4h live sessions, async feedback, and evaluation. Effective hourly could dip; negotiate scope (see below).\n\n### What to clarify/negotiate (before you commit)\n1. **Is “€1,000/day for a tandem” total or per trainer?** (The text reads total.)  \n2. **What counts as the 5 “daily rates”?** Propose a breakdown (e.g., 2 days prep, 2.5 days delivery, 0.5 day evaluation) or request extra 1–2 days for feedback on participant work.  \n3. **VAT / invoicing** (you’re in the EU): confirm VAT treatment and payment schedule.  \n4. **Admin support**: who posts materials on ILIAS, manages cohorts, and handles comms?  \n5. **Safeguarding**: crisis protocols, referral pathways, and boundaries (no 1:1 therapy).\n\n### Fast application angle (what you’d say)\n- **Concept spine (5 weeks, 4h live + 3–4h async):**\n  1) Foundations of trauma-informed peacebuilding (language, window of tolerance, scope).  \n  2) **Collective & transgenerational trauma** in conflict contexts; power, identity, and narrative.  \n  3) **Tools & micro-practices** (grounding, co-regulation, group agreements, brief somatic resets) usable in field settings.  \n  4) **Integrating into conflict analysis & project planning** (risk, do-no-harm, M&E signals of safety/agency).  \n  5) **Boundaries & care** (team rituals, vicarious trauma, peer debriefs, referral maps); capstone mini-plans.\n\n- **Your role vs co-trainer:** you lead pedagogy, online facilitation, and applied project design; partner leads clinical/somatic depth and safeguarding.\n\n- **Methods:** short theory bursts, case labs from participants’ contexts, peer consult triads, light somatic interludes, simple reflection prompts; all materials hosted on ILIAS with weekly missions.\n\n### Bottom line\n- **Money:** €3,250 solo or ~€2,500 each in a tandem (likely), excl. VAT.  \n- **Go/no-go:** **Go**—apply by **22 Oct 2025**. You’re highly competitive; propose a tandem to cover clinical scope and negotiate the prep/feedback days so the fee matches the workload.",

On the other hand side, it should enable peace workers to make constructive use of social media and AI. \nAfter the training, participants should at least have accomplished the following learning objectives. \nParticipants…\n\t•\t…have improved their own social media literacy, most importantly evaluating content and identifying disinformation, AI generated material.\n\t•\t…know about the role and influence of social media and AI on the escalation and de-escalation in conflicts.\n\t•\t…have developed ideas for peace workers to expand spaces for peace and peace narratives on social media and against polarization and online disinformation.\n\t•\t…have identified entry points for the use of digital tools for peace work (e.g. social media analysis, early warning systems, fact checking, messaging on social media…) and feel confident engaging with these tools.\nThe planned schedule is seven weeks of training with weekly two-hour live sessions. Between the live sessions, the participants will work independently and together with others on provided material (literature, podcasts, videos or similar).

Call for Tenders – Main-Facilitator for the Modules Arriving/ Basics of Peace & Conflict Work and Closing\nThe Academy for Conflict Transformation is looking for a Main-Facilitator for two connected Modules forming the beginning and end of the Full-Time Course in Peace and Conflict Work. The Main-Facilitator will be accompanied a Co-Facilitator from the Academy for Conflict Transformation. The Modules takes place from 23 February to 27 February and from 23 April to 25 April 2026 at the Jugendakademie Walberberg, in Bornheim, Germany.\nApplication deadline: 31.10.2025\n1. Background information\nPro Peace supports people involved in violent conflicts on the path to peace and strives to help overcome war and violence. \nOur Academy for Conflict Transformation, the qualification department in Pro Peace, offers a learning space for professionals, international peace workers and experts in the field of civil conflict transformation. Our educational work is an expression of our conviction of the non-violent, constructive ways of dealing with conflicts. The main goal is to provide professionals who already work or intent to work on international peace projects and/or conflict-sensitive development cooperation with practical tools that allow them to contribute to building lasting peace. In our courses, we create learning spaces where theory meets practice. Within this, our educational concept focuses on personal development, self-determination, responsibility and the ability to act in conflicts. One of our central concerns is fostering a personal attitude oriented towards peace-related values among all those who participate in our courses and trainings. The international intercultural exchange and participatory learning are particular strengths of our courses and trainings.\nThe Academy’s portfolio consists of longer, comprehensive courses in peace and conflict work as well as shorter trainings focused on specific topics – both as in-person and online. Furthermore, we offer specific exchange platforms for alumni and orientation trainings for people interested in the Civil Peace Service (CPS). The Academy also offers tailor-made trainings in the field of peace and conflict transformation.\nThe Academy for Conflict Transformation promotes an interactive, varied and playful learning environment and exchange-oriented communication of content. In addition to input from the trainers, the exchange of ideas among the participants, for example in group work and discussions, is also crucial and a valuable resource. We emphasize a warm, encouraging, trusting and appreciating atmosphere in this setting. The facilitator’s expertise and the personal exchange between participants will constitute key components of these trainings. Furthermore, the Academy is aware of different power structures and considers it in the designing of the content and the training. When the need arises, we, together with the trainers, we will create a room where discussions can take place.\n2. General course description and structure\nThe aim of this course is for the participants to acquire the appropriate skills and knowledge needed to work on the diverse and multi-faceted field of peace and conflict work. The participants will deepen their understanding of the conflict dynamics, and non-violent transformation, among others: clarify the key concepts of civil conflict transformation, analyse conflicts, design peace projects, as well as gain a deeper understanding of their roles and attitudes as peace workers. The consolidation of their sense of self, awareness of own patterns, attitudes, behaviours, biases, needs and limits, as well as understanding of group dynamics and the importance of communication, are core issues to the course, and are not only worked on through a theoretical input, but are consistently brought to the focus through self-reflection and group sharing.\nThe course utilizes the elicitive training model, where the learning journey is aimed at discovery and creation using the participants’ experiences and knowledge as the main resource, and where the trainers are catalysts and facilitators rather than experts. The participants’ learning also continues after the official sessions as they will be living together with the other participants throughout the course.\nAt the end of the intensive full-time course, the participants will have:\n\t•\tExamined their own motivations, attitudes and perspectives on peace work;\n\t•\tPracticed the selected conflict transformation skills in the classroom setting and identify ways and ideas how could they be implemented in their work settings;\n\t•\tAnalysed their own conflict settings and their own projects through the use of different lenses and frameworks conveyed in each module;\n\t•\tDeveloped project ideas or improve existing projects derived from the results of the conflict analysis;\n\t•\tDeveloped a plan for application of the knowledge and skills learned to their own work / conflict settings.\n\n3. Expected learning outcomes of the first and last Module\nThe Modules Arriving/ Basics of Peace & Conflict Work and Closing form the frame for a two-month learning journey for a core group of ten participants. These participants are all practitioners of peace and conflict work or neighbouring fields. At the same time, they have highly diverse backgrounds: professionally their background varies from lawyers, advocating for human rights over civil society activists to international experts with degrees in Peace Studies. On top they come from all over the world, sometimes being outside of their home countries for the first time, forming a wonderfully diverse group.\nThe idea of the first Module is threefold:\n\t•\tFacilitating the arrival of the participants, the forming of a group and the creation of a safe and trustful space.\n\t•\tCovering the Basics of Peace and Conflict Work including the terms Conflict, Peace, Violence, Nonviolence, Conflict Transformation, Peacebuilding and Basic Conflict Analysis. Additionally, explaining how the entirety of the Full-Time Course deepens different essential aspects of Peace Work, also highlighting the common threat going through the course. \n\t•\tSet the base for a two-month learning journey. This includes aspects of learning theory, the adaptation of these for each individual, as well as the discussion and sharpening of individual learning objectives.\nThe ideas of the last Module are:\n\t•\tFacilitating the formation of connections among the participants for after the course as well as the celebration of the transformation that the participants will have gone through on an individual basis and as a group.\n\t•\tSupporting the bridging of the knowledge from the course setting to their own contexts. \n\t•\tProviding space for closing reflections and feedback for the participants, the trainers and the Academy for Conflict Transformation.\n\n4. Procedure and Deliverables \n\nThe desired learning outcomes serves as a springboard for the module design but trainers could also put in additional/take out some when they see fit. Furthermore, the tenders should show how these outcomes could be met. The module’s pedagogy should focus not only on learning the theories and approaches but above all, on the application during the course and later in their own work/conflict contexts. Furthermore, modular interlinkages should be ensured in a way that succeeding modules should also build on the previous ones. It is therefore recommendable to think of connections/linkages to lots running before, after and/or parallel to the one applying for.\nThere will be a Co-Facilitation presented from the side of the Academy. This person will accompany the rest of the course, including the hand-over between the trainers, the regular reflection circles focused on the group dynamics, the communication with the venue and the reception of feedback towards the trainers and the Academy.\nThe following tasks are expected to be delivered in close collaboration with the Co-Facilitator:\n\nConceptualization and preparation of the training\n\n\t•\tProvides the training design and literature/materials;\n\t•\tAttends the trainers’ meeting to ensure linkages to the other modules, ensuring hand overs and general coordination with the Academy advisors and other trainers;\n\t•\tSends the detailed and updated training outline and materials to the educational advisor latest two weeks before the start.\nImplementation of the Modules\n\n\t•\tFacilitates the in-person sessions independently;\n\t•\tAdapts the course design and methodologies to needs of the participants, when the situation arises;\n\t•\tProvides a space/platform for addressing tensions/conflicts when the need arises;\n\t•\tGives timely feedback to the Academy’s educational advisors regarding the participants’ engagements and contributions. \nPost-course debriefing and hand over\n\n\t•\tProvides relevant information to the next trainer about the participants’ engagements, contributions, challenges, among others;\n\t•\tAttends a debrief (online) meeting with the educational advisors.\n\n5. Trainer and tender requirement\n\nThe trainer must fulfil the following criteria:\n\n\t1\tSubstantial knowledge of the theory of the course subject and its practical application. The theories and knowledge base should represent a wide array of schools of thoughts, including non-Eurocentric perspectives;\n\t2\tSubstantial knowledge of adult education methodologies through long-term experience as trainer in multi-cultural contexts;\n\t3\tFull English proficiency;\n\t4\tExcellent facilitation and communication skills, including the ability to convey abstract/complex concepts and terms (both in the design and in the actual training facilitation) in a manner that could be understood by the participants;\n\t5\tPossess self-awareness, openness to feedback and ability to deal with conflicts in a constructive manner;\n\t6\tBeing aware of various power dynamics within the classroom and the openness to create a platform to discuss power related issues during the module implementation, whenever the need arises.\n\n6. Assessment procedure\n\nThe selection will be done in line with the following criteria.\nQualification and experience (Weight: 40%)\n\t•\teducational background and further education on the subject\n\t•\ttraining experience, use of adult learning methods and tools, practical project \n\t•\texperiences in the field\n\t•\texpertise on the subject\nConcept (Weight: 60%)\n\t•\tshows how the learning outcomes will be realized and group processes and self-reflection are incorporated\n\t•\tfull outline\n\t•\tuse of appropriate methods and tools to convey the content\n\n\n7. Fees\n\nThe Academy offers a daily fee of 650€ (excl. VAT). For the first and last Module of the Full-Time Course in Peace and Conflict Work we calculate 11 working days (8 days of training facilitation and 3 days of preparation, attending a trainer’s meeting, and debriefing).\nTravel costs will be reimbursed in accordance with German law (“Bundesreisekostengesetz”).\nFood and accommodation for the trainers will be provided in the venue „Jugendakademie Walberberg“ in Bornheim, Germany.\n\n8.
