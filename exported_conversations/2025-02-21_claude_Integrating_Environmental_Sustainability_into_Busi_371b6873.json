What time would work best for you?\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm going to share my process below to ensure it's clear why I'm making this workbook and how I intend to integrate it with the modules and the module content upgrades. Once I get a go-ahead on the process after Sunday, I will continue with the Accelerator priority modules.\n\nGoal: \n\nInstead of creating numerous worksheets, we aim to share climate awareness and link it to business risks, then support them to act on it. To operationalize that, we will develop business resilience through a streamlined workbook, The Business Efficiency Workbook, that is referred to throughout various Five One Labs training modules.\n\nThis approach ensures that businesses in Iraq recognize climate risks during their design thinking, marketing, and product development strategies, and it encourages them to take practical steps to improve efficiency (and therefore climate resilience) - without merely focusing on being \"Green\".\n\nDevelopment Approach:\n\nDone:\n\nRaise awareness of climate risks for businesses in Iraq. (Slides completed)\n\nIdentify priority areas for integrating climate concepts. (Completed)\n\nNext:\n\nSelect a priority module from the Ignite/Accelerator program and decide:\n\nCan climate resilience be integrated into the Efficiency Workbook? If so, integrate it.\n\nDo we need a new worksheet? If so, develop it.\n\nShould we modify the presentation? If so, modify it.\n\nImplementation Approach for Training:\n\nGuide businesses to first identify risks using the risk assessment sheet. (To be determined where / when / how often during the accelerator to review risk worksheet)\n\nMove selected actions into the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW) to:\n\nIdentify risks\n\nImprove business resilience\n\nSelect and monitor key actions\n\n\n\nImplementation Approach During Training:\n\nBusinesses assess risks first using the risk sheet (likely during the \"Pitch\" or the \"Brand\" phase of Ignite). Telling stories about risk and risk mitigation can be an important element for their pitches.\n\nRisks related to efficiency are moved into the Business Efficiency Workbook.\n\nBusinesses track actions to improve resilience and monitor impact over time (various modules directing towards workbook)\n\nLoop and repeat at various points in the accelerator to flesh out the Business Efficiency Workbook, similar to the Financial Workbook growing more robust over time.\n\nThis reduces complexity and ensures businesses see climate resilience as a smart business strategy rather than extra work.\n\n]]]\n\nAsk it to use the rubric below to assess the content and to score the slide\n\nThen ask it to generate suggestions for improvement for the slides and facilitation notes and critique it ensuring it’s streamlined, minimally invasive, yet maximally impactful.\n\nThen ask it if a worksheet might be needed. And then only if absolutely necessary let’s make a markdown version of the worksheet.\n\n\n\nBe sure to follow this approach to adapt an entrepreneurship program to be more Climate-Resilient\n\nFraming Climate Resilience as Business Resilience\n\nInstead of presenting climate adaptation as an environmental initiative, we will position it as a necessary component of modern business strategy.\n\nThis may require an additional section in the curriculum supporting this realization and opening the connection between climate and successful business strategy. Entrepreneurs will learn to:\n\nAnticipate shifts in market demand, supply chains, and consumer preferences due to rising energy costs and environmental factors.\n\nDevelop business models that remain viable in an increasingly resource-constrained world.\n\nIdentify funding and investment opportunities linked to sustainability, such as impact investing and climate adaptation grants.\n\nKey Principles of Integration\n\nEmbedded, Not Added\n\nClimate resilience is not a standalone topic—it is integrated into market research, financial planning, business model design, and operations.\n\nReal-World Examples\n\nCase studies will highlight businesses in Iraq, KRI, and internationally that have successfully adapted to climate challenges.\n\nFlexibility & Feasibility\n\nEntrepreneurs will be introduced to staged adaptation strategies, allowing them to implement small, cost-effective changes now, with a roadmap for scaling up over time.\n\nRisk Management as a Core Business Skill\n\nBusinesses will learn how to monitor environmental and economic risks and adjust their models accordingly.\n\n\n\n3.

Resilience in Incubator Curriculum vs. Green School Quality Standard: Greening Every Learning Environment\n\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen School Quality Standard Recommendations\n\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\n\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\n\nDevelop a Green School Action Plan\n\n(Clear steps, responsibilities, and monitoring for sustainability initiatives)\n\n- The proposal outlines a structured Implementation Timeline for integrating climate resilience into the incubator curriculum.\n\n- The Curriculum Integration Strategy identifies specific intervention points in the Business Model Canvas (BMC).\n\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal includes structured phases, but it lacks explicit monitoring and evaluation plans to track progress.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce a progress tracking mechanism (e.g., feedback loops, sustainability progress dashboard for businesses).\n\nMonitor and Evaluate Progress\n\n(SMART targets, periodic evaluations, and avoiding greenwashing)\n\n- The proposal includes rubric-based evaluations for assessing resilience in the curriculum.\n\n- Key Deliverables mention an assessment of 32 curriculum sessions for improvement.\n\n✅ Alignment with improvement potential – The proposal addresses evaluation, but it doesn’t mention specific key performance indicators (KPIs) or methods for tracking business adaptation over time.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Develop clear KPIs such as:\n\n- % of businesses implementing climate resilience strategies\n\n- Success rates in securing climate-linked investments\n\n- Reduction in operational costs through energy efficiency\n\nFoster Community Engagement\n\n(Sharing sustainability best practices with the broader community)\n\n- The proposal includes case studies showcasing climate-resilient businesses in Iraq and internationally.\n\n- Additional services include business resilience coaching and policy & regulatory reports.\n\n✅ Good Alignment – The proposal focuses on community learning through real-world case studies.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Encourage peer learning and networking among entrepreneurs through sustainability forums, mentorship programs, or incubator alumni engagement.\n\nImprove Facilities and Operations\n\n(Water conservation, waste management, and infrastructure improvements for climate resilience)\n\n- The proposal focuses on business operations (lean operations, energy efficiency, sustainable supply chains).\n\n✅ Alignment in a business context – While the proposal integrates climate-conscious business operations, it doesn’t explicitly address waste management or water conservation.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Include training modules on circular economy principles and green infrastructure for businesses.\n\nEnhance Teaching and Learning\n\n(Integrate sustainability across subjects, participatory learning, hands-on projects)\n\n- Climate resilience is embedded across business modules, not treated as an isolated topic.\n\n- Uses Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a practical tool for integration.\n\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum ensures climate resilience is a core business skill.\n\n➡ Enhancement: Incorporate experiential learning, such as business simulations, hands-on resilience-building exercises, and real-time problem-solving workshops.\n\nStrengthen Policy and Stakeholder Engagement\n\n(Stakeholder workshops, engagement with indigenous knowledge, advocacy training)\n\n- The proposal includes a Policy & Regulatory Landscape Report to guide entrepreneurs on compliance and future climate policies.\n\n✅ Good Alignment – Addresses policy adaptation but lacks a community advocacy component.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Introduce policy roundtables or stakeholder dialogues for entrepreneurs to actively engage in policy discussions on climate resilience.\n\nAddress Climate Resilience and Disaster Preparedness\n\n(Emergency planning, climate risk reduction strategies)\n\n- The proposal integrates risk management as a business skill, helping businesses anticipate and mitigate climate risks.\n\n✅ Strong Alignment – The curriculum tackles climate risks through business continuity planning.\n\n➡ Enhancement: Add disaster preparedness training (e.g., what to do in case of climate-induced supply chain disruptions or extreme weather events).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnex 2:\n\nClimate Resilience in Incubator Curriculum vs. GreenComp: The European Sustainability Competence Framework\n\nLink: here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenComp Competence Area\n\nProposal for Integrating Climate Resilience into the Incubator Curriculum\n\nAlignment & Improvement Suggestions\n\nEmbodying Sustainability Values (Understanding ecological limits, fairness, and justice in sustainability)\n\n- Focuses on financial risk, supply chain adaptation, and business continuity.\n\n- Sustainability is framed as a business strategy, but ethical and social justice aspects are not emphasized.\n\n✅ Partial Alignment – The proposal integrates sustainability but does not explicitly address fairness and social justice in business models.\n\n➡ Recommendation: Expand on ethical decision-making and incorporate regenerative business models that prioritize fair trade, equity, and community

            "extracted_content": "Process Document: Integrating Climate Resilience into the Five One Labs Curriculum\nOverview\nThis process enables an intelligent assistant to use LLMs to assess, score, and improve individual modules of the Five One Labs entrepreneurship curriculum. The goal is to integrate climate resilience as a business strategy, ensuring entrepreneurs recognize and act on climate risks while maintaining the curriculum’s core structure. The process is designed to be minimally invasive yet maximally impactful, with a focus on practical, actionable changes.\nThe process is divided into six clear steps:\nAssess the Module Content\nScore the Module Using the Rubric\nIdentify Areas for Improvement\nSuggest Minimal, Impactful Changes\nDetermine if a Worksheet is Needed\nDocument the Assessment and Improvements\nEach step includes a detailed prompt for the LLM and guidance for the assistant. The process leverages the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW) as a central tool for integrating climate resilience, ensuring consistency across modules.\nStep 1: Assess the Module Content\nObjective: Understand the current module’s content and objectives to identify where climate resilience can be naturally integrated.\nPrompt for LLM:\nAnalyze the provided module content (slides and facilitation notes) for the [Module Name]. Summarize the key objectives, activities, and outcomes of the module. Identify any existing mentions of sustainability, efficiency, or risk management, even if indirect. Highlight sections where climate resilience could be relevant but is not currently addressed. Consider the following:\n- Opportunities to link climate risks to business strategy (e.g., market shifts, resource constraints).\n- Ways to embed sustainability into existing activities (e.g., adding eco-constraints to brainstorming).\n- Alignment with the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW) for tracking risks and actions.\nGuidance:\nFocus on understanding the module’s purpose and flow.\nLook for opportunities to tie climate resilience to existing concepts (e.g., risk management, market trends, operations).\nUse local context (e.g., Iraq/KRI-specific challenges like water scarcity, energy costs) to make assessments relevant.\nStep 2: Score the Module Using the Rubric\nObjective: Evaluate the module’s current integration of climate resilience using the provided rubric.\nPrompt for LLM:\nUsing the rubric below, assess the module’s integration of climate resilience. Assign a score from 1 to 5 for each relevant rubric element (hard and soft skills). Provide a brief justification for each score based on the module content.\n\n**Rubric Elements:**\n- **Hard Skills:**\n  - Business Model Resilience\n  - Risk Management & Scenario Planning\n  - Circular Economy & Sustainable Operations\n  - Technology & Innovation for Sustainability\n  - Sustainability as a Value Proposition\n  - Triple Bottom Line Thinking (People, Planet, Profit)\n  - Measuring Social & Environmental Impact\n  - Stakeholder & Community Engagement\n  - Understanding Green Markets & Consumer Trends\n  - Access to Green Investment & Incentives\n  - Product & Service Design for Sustainability\n  - Scalability & Climate-Smart Business Growth\n  - Collaboration with Sustainability Networks\n- **Soft Skills (GreenComp):**\n  - Valuing Sustainability: Reflecting on personal values and their alignment with sustainability.\n  - Supporting Fairness: Supporting equity and justice for current and future generations.\n  - Promoting Nature: Acknowledging humans as part of nature and respecting its needs.\n  - Systems Thinking: Approaching sustainability problems holistically.\n  - Critical Thinking: Assessing information and challenging assumptions.\n  - Problem Framing: Formulating challenges in terms of difficulty, people, time, and scope.\n  - Futures Literacy: Envisioning alternative sustainable futures.\n  - Adaptability: Managing transitions in complex sustainability situations.\n  - Exploratory Thinking: Exploring interdisciplinary connections and experimenting with novel ideas.\n  - Political Agency: Navigating political systems and demanding effective sustainability policies.\n  - Collective Action: Acting for change collaboratively.\n  - Individual Initiative: Identifying personal potential for sustainability contributions.\n\n**Scoring Framework:**\n- 1: Not Addressed (Element is absent or mentioned in passing)\n- 2: Basic Awareness (Element is introduced but lacks practical tools)\n- 3: Practical Integration (Element includes specific tools, examples, or exercises)\n- 4: Strong Application (Element is well-integrated with local context and applications)\n- 5: Advanced Integration (Element is fully embedded with metrics, tools, and real-world applications)\nGuidance:\nUse the rubric elements provided in the client’s framework.\nFocus on the most relevant elements for the module’s content (e.g., \"Market Research\" aligns with \"Understanding Green Markets & Consumer Trends\").\nDocument scores and justifications clearly for each element.\nPrioritize hard skills for practical applications and soft skills for mindset shifts.\nStep 3: Identify Areas for Improvement\nObjective: Pinpoint specific gaps where climate resilience can be integrated to enhance the module’s impact.\nPrompt for LLM:\nBased on the assessment and scoring, identify key areas for improvement in the module. Focus on gaps where climate resilience is either not addressed or only minimally integrated. Consider the following:\n- Opportunities to link climate risks to business strategy (e.g., market shifts, resource constraints).\n- Ways to embed sustainability into existing activities (e.g., adding eco-constraints to brainstorming).\n- Alignment with the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW) for tracking risks and actions.\n- Client’s curriculum review comments, including:\n  - Market & Business Opportunity: Identifying green markets, using sustainability as a competitive advantage.\n  - Product & Service Design: Considering materials, energy efficiency, and circular economy concepts.\n  - Operations & Supply Chain: Choosing green processes, optimizing energy consumption.\n  - Customer Research & Understanding: Surveying environmental concerns, mapping sustainability touchpoints.\n  - Financial Considerations: Calculating costs and savings of green investments.\n  - Strategic Planning & Risk Management: Including environmental factors in business plans.\n  - Networking & Partnerships: Connecting with sustainability networks and experts.\nGuidance:\nPrioritize areas that align with the module’s objectives and the BEW.\nLook for natural tie-ins to avoid disrupting the module’s flow.\nUse local context (e.g., Iraq/KRI-specific challenges like water scarcity, energy costs) to make improvements relevant.\nStep 4: Suggest Minimal, Impactful Changes\nObjective: Propose small, strategic changes to the slides and facilitation notes that integrate climate resilience without overhauling the module.\nPrompt for LLM:\nSuggest minimal, impactful changes to the module’s slides and facilitation notes to integrate climate resilience. Focus on:\n- Adding prompts or questions that encourage entrepreneurs to consider climate risks (e.g., \"How might rising energy costs affect your operations?\").\n- Including local examples or case studies relevant to Iraq/KRI (e.g., businesses adapting to water scarcity).\n- Tying activities to the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW) for tracking risks and actions.\n- Aligning with the client’s curriculum review comments (e.g., integrating green markets, sustainable operations).\nEnsure the changes are practical, require minimal effort to implement, and align with the module’s objectives.\nGuidance:\nAim for 1-2 small changes per module (e.g., a new prompt, a local example).\nEnsure changes are actionable and do not require extensive rework.\nReference the BEW where relevant to reinforce its use.\nUse local context to make changes relatable (e.g., Iraqi businesses adapting to climate challenges).\nStep 5: Determine if a Worksheet is Needed\nObjective: Decide if a simple worksheet is necessary to support the integration of climate resilience and, if so, create a markdown version.\nPrompt for LLM:\nEvaluate whether a worksheet is necessary to support the integration of climate resilience in this module. Consider if:\n- The module involves activities where entrepreneurs need to document or reflect on climate risks (e.g., risk assessment, action planning).\n- A worksheet would enhance understanding or provide a practical tool for implementation.\nIf a worksheet is needed, create a simple markdown version with 1-2 key prompts or questions. Ensure it aligns with the BEW and is easy to use. Format the worksheet as follows:\n```markdown\n### [Worksheet Title]\n- **Prompt 1**: [Question or task]\n- **Prompt 2**: [Question or task]\n\n**Guidance:**\n- Worksheets should only be created if they add clear value and cannot be integrated into existing materials.\n- Keep worksheets minimal (e.g., a half-page note with one or two questions).\n- Ensure worksheets tie back to the BEW to maintain consistency.\n- Avoid unnecessary worksheets to reduce complexity.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Document the Assessment and Improvements**\n**Objective:** Compile the assessment, scoring, and suggestions into a clear, actionable format for implementation.\n\n**Prompt for LLM:**\nCompile the following into a structured document for the [Module Name]:\nSummary of the module’s current content and objectives.\nScores for relevant rubric elements with justifications.\nIdentified areas for improvement.\nSuggested changes to slides and facilitation notes.\nWorksheet (if applicable), including a brief explanation of its purpose.\nEnsure the document is clear, concise, and can be easily implemented by curriculum developers. Use the template below for consistency.\n\n**Guidance:**\n- Use a consistent template for each module to ensure uniformity.\n- Include specific slide numbers or activity names where changes are suggested.\n- Highlight how the suggestions tie back to the BEW and the client’s goal of framing climate resilience as a business strategy.\n\n---\n\n### **Template for Documenting Each Module**\nTo ensure consistency, use the following template for each module’s assessment and improvement plan:\n\n---\n\n#### **Module: [Module Name]**\n\n**1. Module Summary**  \n[Brief summary of the module’s objectives, activities, and outcomes.]\n\n**2.

Here’s a template you can reuse:\n\nmarkdown\nCopy\nEdit\n**Prompt Template**:\nYou are an expert in curriculum design, climate resilience, and entrepreneurship. \nUsing the rubric and guidelines below, please do the following for the text provided:\n\n1. **Summarize the Module**: Provide a brief summary (2-3 sentences) of what the module covers.\n\n2. **Score the Module Using the Rubric**:\n   - For each relevant “Hard Skill” (e.g., Risk Management, Sustainability as a Value Proposition) and “Soft Skill” (from GreenComp), assign a score (1 to 5).\n   - Use the scoring definitions:\n     1 - Not Addressed \n     2 - Basic Awareness\n     3 - Practical Integration\n     4 - Strong Application\n     5 - Advanced Integration\n\n3. **Identify Gaps/Weaknesses**:\n   - Highlight what’s missing or underemphasized in terms of climate resilience and sustainability.\n   - Reference any relevant points from the client’s curriculum review clusters (e.g., Market & Business Opportunity, Product & Service Design, etc.).\n\n4. **Provide Improvement Suggestions**:\n   - Suggest **minimal** but **impactful** slide text changes or facilitation notes to integrate climate resilience.\n   - Reference real-world Iraqi/KRI examples if possible.\n   - For each suggestion, keep it practical and aligned with “business efficiency” messaging.\n\n5. **Indicate If a New Worksheet Is Needed**:\n   - If the content can integrate seamlessly into the existing Business Efficiency Workbook, mention which page/section it might link to.\n   - If a new worksheet is absolutely necessary, propose it in **markdown** format under a heading “Proposed Worksheet”.\n\n6. **Draft Updated or Additional Content**:\n   - Provide any new bullet points, slides, or speaker notes we could add to better address climate resilience without overwhelming participants.\n\n7. **Additional Checks**:\n   - Ensure we position climate resilience as “business resilience” and “operational efficiency,” not an “extra environmental responsibility.”\n   - Verify improvements align with local context and the risk environment in Iraq/KRI.\n   \n**Rubric & References**:\n[Paste your rubric, e.g., 3.2 Hard Skills, 3.2 Soft Skills, plus the climate resilience integration strategy, BMC alignment, or any other references]\n\n**Module Text to Analyze**:\n[Paste the raw text or slides for the module here]\nUsage:\n\nCopy-paste the Prompt Template into your LLM.\nInsert the module’s raw text at the bottom.\nInsert any rubric references needed.\nLet the LLM generate a structured response.\n3. Run the LLM Analysis\nPaste the Prompt Template with the module text into your LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).\nReview the output.\nYou’ll get a module summary, scores, gaps, improvement ideas, worksheet suggestions, and proposed updated slides or notes.\n4. Interpret & Implement LLM Output\nCheck Scoring: Confirm the LLM’s scores make sense. Adjust if needed.\nIncorporate the Recommendations:\nIf the LLM suggests small text changes, directly edit your slides or speaker notes.\nIf it recommends adding local case studies or data, gather relevant info (e.g., Iraqi solar business, KESK success story) and insert it.\nWorksheets:\nIf the LLM says you can adapt your existing “Business Efficiency Workbook,” simply insert the new recommended questions or prompts into the existing workbook sections.\nIf the LLM recommends a brand new worksheet, check if it’s truly necessary. If so, adopt the LLM’s markdown template or adapt it further.\n5. (Optional) Re-run for Validation\nOnce you’ve updated your slides or notes, run them back through the same prompt to confirm you’ve integrated changes effectively.\nThe LLM will give you a new score and confirm if your modifications address the gaps.\n6. Keep a Living “Master Curriculum Tracker”\nMaintain a simple spreadsheet or table to track each module’s:\n\nModule Name\nDate of LLM Assessment\nScores Before and After updates\nActions Taken (text changes, new slides, new worksheets, references to the Business Efficiency Workbook)\nThis ensures you see progress over time and maintain consistency across the entire curriculum.\n\nIllustrative Example\nBelow is a mini-example showing how you might prompt the LLM for the “Design Thinking” module from IGNITE, and the kind of output you can expect.\n\n<details> <summary>**Prompt to LLM**</summary>\nmarkdown\nCopy\nEdit\nYou are an expert in curriculum design, climate resilience, and entrepreneurship. \nUsing the rubric and guidelines below, please do the following for the text provided:\n\n1. Summarize the module in 2-3 sentences.\n2. Score the module using the Hard Skill Rubric (Business Model Resilience, Risk Management, etc.) and the Soft Skill Rubric (GreenComp).\n3. Identify any gaps or weaknesses in climate resilience.\n4. Provide improvement suggestions for slides/facilitation notes, focusing on minimal changes that have maximum impact.\n5. Indicate if a new worksheet is needed or if we can integrate changes into our existing Business Efficiency Workbook.\n6. Draft any additional bullet points or slides that you recommend adding.\n7. Ensure climate resilience is framed as business resilience.\n\n**Rubric**:\n1 - Not Addressed \n2 - Basic Awareness\n3 - Practical Integration\n4 - Strong Application\n5 - Advanced Integration\n\nHard Skills: \n- Risk Management & Scenario Planning\n- Sustainability as a Value Proposition\n- (etc.)\n\nSoft Skills (GreenComp):\n- Systems thinking\n- Futures literacy\n- (etc.)\n\n**Module Text**:\n[Paste your slides or script for the “Design Thinking” session here]\n</details>\nPossible LLM Output:\nSummary: The module covers the basics of design thinking, including problem definition, brainstorming, prototyping, and user testing. It aims to help entrepreneurs empathize with customers and generate solutions quickly.\nScores:\nRisk Management & Scenario Planning: 1 (Not Addressed)\nSustainability as a Value Proposition: 2 (Basic Awareness)\n…\nGaps: Lack of explicit mention of resource constraints, environmental factors, or sustainability in problem framing.\nImprovement Suggestions: Insert a quick mention during “Brainstorming” to consider energy/resource constraints. Add an example scenario about water scarcity or heat waves in Iraq to highlight local context.\nWorksheet Needed?: No. Integrate into the existing Business Efficiency Workbook under “Design Constraints” by adding a short “Resource Efficiency Brainstorm Checklist.”\nDraft Additional Slide:\nSlide Title: “Efficiency in Design Thinking”\nBullet Points:\nConsider climate and energy constraints from the start.\nExplore how your solution might reduce waste or resource usage.\nFacilitator Note: Emphasize local examples (e.g., water shortages).\n7. Next Steps & Tips\nTrain Facilitators: Make sure trainers know the new climate resilience content and can speak to it confidently.\nIterate: If the LLM’s suggestions feel too detailed or heavy, refine your instructions to keep them “minimally invasive but maximally impactful.”\nApply to All Modules: Follow the same process for each module to maintain a unified approach.\nFinal Implementation Document (Summary)\nCollect Content: Gather raw slides/scripts for the module you want to update.\nUse the “LLM Prompt Template”: Supply the rubric, the module text, and the instructions on how to assess, score, and propose improvements.\nReview and Integrate: Insert recommended changes into slides, speaker notes, or the Business Efficiency Workbook.\nDecide on Worksheets: Only create new worksheets if integration in the existing workbook is not sufficient.\nRe-run & Validate: Re-check the updated module with the LLM for final confirmation and scoring.\nTrack Progress: Keep a record of changes and final scores to ensure continuous improvement across the entire program.\nFollowing these seven steps and using the provided prompt template will streamline how you use an LLM to enhance each module’s climate resilience content—one module at a time—without overwhelming your trainers or participants."

            "extracted_content": "FIVE ONE LABS: CLIMATE-RESILIENT CURRICULUM UPDATE PROCESS\nI. Introduction & Key Principles\nEmbedded, Not Added\nWe frame climate resilience as business resilience—an essential aspect of modern entrepreneurship in Iraq/KRI. It is not an extra environmental step but rather a core risk management and business efficiency measure.\n\nReal-World Examples\nUse case studies highlighting Iraqi/KRI businesses that have adapted to local climate challenges (e.g., energy costs, water scarcity). This makes sustainability relevant and actionable for participants.\n\nFlexibility & Feasibility\nIntroduce staged adaptation strategies: small, cost-effective changes now, a roadmap for scaling over time.\n\nRisk Management as Core Business Skill\nMonitor environmental and economic risks, adjusting the model accordingly. This is especially relevant in contexts like the KRI with inconsistent electricity and potential water shortages.\n\nILO Green Business Booklet & GreenComp\nWe reference:\n\nILO Green Business Booklet (for greening processes, supply chain, and product design).\nGreenComp (European Sustainability Competence Framework) for soft skills like systems thinking and futures literacy.\nBusiness Efficiency Workbook (BEW)\nThe BEW is a central living document used throughout the program. At key points, participants fill in resource use, potential climate risks, and adaptation actions. We add or modify worksheets only if needed.\n\nII. The Four-Stage Process\nWe have fewer (4) major stages, each with a single, detailed prompt to run in an LLM. That yields a Module Update Report and a Scoring & Integration Tracker.\n\nStage 1: Summarize & Identify Existing Climate Links\nObjective: Understand the module’s content, goals, and any implicit references to sustainability or resource efficiency.\n\nPrompt (Paste your raw slides/content at the end):\n\nmarkdown\nCopy\nEdit\n[ROLE: You are a curriculum consultant integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training.]\n\n1. **Summarize the Module**:\n   - Provide a short (2–3 sentence) summary of the module’s main objectives, topics, and flow.\n\n2. **Identify Existing Sustainability or Efficiency Elements**:\n   - Note any references (even indirect) to resource use, risk management, or “green” topics.\n   - Mention potential local Iraqi/KRI contexts (e.g., water scarcity, rising energy costs).\n\n3. **Pinpoint Natural Integration Opportunities**:\n   - Where could we easily mention climate resilience without disrupting the lesson flow?\n   - Which sections or slides are best for referencing the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)?\n\nLLM Output: A short list of relevant existing references plus some “low-hanging fruit” for improvement.\n\nStage 2: Score Using Hard & Soft Skills Rubrics\nWe use two rubrics:\n\nHard Skill Rubric Elements\n\nBusiness Model Resilience\nRisk Management & Scenario Planning\nCircular Economy & Sustainable Operations\nTechnology & Innovation for Sustainability\nSustainability as a Value Proposition\nTriple Bottom Line Thinking (People, Planet, Profit)\nMeasuring Social & Environmental Impact\nStakeholder & Community Engagement\nUnderstanding Green Markets & Consumer Trends\nAccess to Green Investment & Incentives\nProduct & Service Design for Sustainability\nScalability & Climate-Smart Business Growth\nCollaboration with Sustainability Networks\nSoft Skill Rubric (GreenComp)\nArea 1: Embodying Sustainability Values\n\n1.1 Valuing sustainability: Reflect on personal values and how they align with sustainability.\n1.2 Supporting fairness: Support equity and justice for current/future generations.\n1.3 Promoting nature: Respect the rights of nature, restore healthy ecosystems.\nArea 2: Embracing Complexity in Sustainability\n\n2.1 Systems thinking: Approach problems from all sides, consider time/space/context.\n2.2 Critical thinking: Assess info, challenge assumptions, reflect on biases.\n2.3 Problem framing: Formulate challenges as sustainability problems, identify suitable prevention or adaptation approaches.\nArea 3: Envisioning Sustainable Futures\n\n3.1 Futures literacy: Envision alternative sustainable futures; scenario planning.\n3.2 Adaptability: Manage transitions and challenges in complex situations.\n3.3 Exploratory thinking: Use creativity and experimentation with novel methods.\nArea 4: Acting for Sustainability\n\n4.1 Political agency: Navigate policy, demand effective sustainability actions.\n4.2 Collective action: Collaborate for change.\n4.3 Individual initiative: Contribute personally to improving community/planet.\nScoring Scale:\n\n1: (Not Addressed)\n2: (Basic Awareness)\n3: (Practical Integration)\n4: (Strong Application)\n5: (Advanced Integration)\nPrompt:\n\nmarkdown\nCopy\nEdit\nUsing the Hard Skills and Soft Skills rubrics below, assign a score (1–5) to each relevant element based on the module text:\n\n[PASTE your Hard Skills list + Soft Skills list, as above]\n\n- Provide a short reason for each score (max 2 sentences).\n- Focus on the local Iraqi/KRI context if applicable.\n- Do not skip any element that might be relevant to the module’s content.\n\nLLM Output: A table or list of each rubric element with a score and justification. The highest priorities are typically those scoring 1–2 if they strongly align with the module’s core theme (e.g., “User Research” aligns with “Understanding Green Markets & Consumer Trends”).\n\nStage 3: Provide Update Suggestions & Revised Text\nObjective: Gather specific, minimal textual changes or additions to integrate climate resilience, referencing the Business Efficiency Workbook whenever possible.\n\nPrompt:\n\nmarkdown\nCopy\nEdit\nBased on the scoring and summary above, please propose specific slide/facilitation updates:\n\n1. **Recommended Updates**:\n   - For each slide or section (use actual slide numbers or section titles), \n     - Show the “Before” text \n     - Show the revised “After” text\n     - Provide a 1-sentence rationale.\n\n2. **Business Efficiency Workbook Integration**:\n   - Indicate where we can direct participants to fill out or reflect in the BEW (e.g., “Document this resource risk in the BEW’s Risk Assessment”).\n   - If we do need a new worksheet, provide a short markdown draft.\n\n3. **Simple Table Format**:\n   - Output an easy-to-read table with columns: \n     `Module | Slide/Section | Before | After | Action | Rationale |`\n\nLLM Output:\n\nA table of changes, e.g.:\nModule\tSlide #\tBefore\tAfter\tAction\tRationale\nDesign Thinking\t2\t“Tell us a little bit about your idea.”\t“Tell us a little bit about your idea. Have you thought about any resource…“\tUpdate the wording in notes\tEncourages reflection on resource constraints from the start.\nDesign Thinking\t5\t“We’ll do a brainstorm on user needs.”\t“We’ll do a brainstorm on user needs, focusing on cost savings & eco-lens.”\tInsert environment prompt\tIntroduces climate resilience thinking with minimal disruption.\n…and so on.\n\nIf the LLM says, for example, “No new worksheet needed—just instruct participants to fill in the ‘Energy & Resource’ section of the BEW,” that’s the final recommendation.\n\nStage 4: Final Documentation & Tracking\nObjective: Produce two final references for your internal records:\n\nModule Update Report (Single-Module): Summarizes what changed and why.\nScoring & Integration Tracker (Multi-Module): A simplified view across all modules.\n(A) Module Update Report\nA single table can suffice:\n\nModule\tRubric Scores (1–5)\tKey Improvement Areas\tChanges Made\tWorksheet?\nDesign Thinking\tRisk Mgt: 2 → 3\nSustainability Value: 2 → 3\nSystemsThinking: 1 → 3\t1. Added resource lens to user research\n2. Brainstorm eco-friendly prototypes\tSlide #2 text updated\nSlide #5 new prompt\tNone – integrated into BEW “Design Phase” tab\nThis shows the scores before/after (if you recheck with the LLM post-update), the improvement areas, changes made, and if a new worksheet was created.\n\n(B) Scoring & Integration Tracker (Master Sheet)\nKeep a master spreadsheet for all modules:\n\nModule\tElements\tScore\tShort Explanation\tPriority (1–4)\tBEW Section\tImprovement\nDesign Thinking\tProduct & Service Design for Sustain.\t3\tSome basic awareness of eco material selection, but no local examples\t2\t“Design Phase” tab\tAdd local success story; refer to BEW to log resource use\nMarket Research\tUnderstanding Green Markets\t2\tMentions general market stats, doesn’t cover climate-linked shifts in consumer demand\t1\t“Market Factors” tab\tInsert local climate data example\n(etc.)\t…\t…\t…\t…\t…\t…\nColumns can be adapted, but keep it short and standardized across modules.\n\nIII. Annex: Full Content References (No “...etc.”)\nBelow are key references from the original climate integration strategy, ensuring we keep them “in full”:\n\n(A) Climate Resilience as Business Resilience\nFraming: Position climate adaptation not as an environmental initiative alone but as a modern business necessity.\n\nAnticipate shifts in market demand, supply chains, and consumer preferences due to rising energy costs and environmental factors.\nDevelop business models viable in resource-constrained contexts.\nIdentify funding/investment opportunities in sustainability (impact investing, climate adaptation grants).\n(B) Key Principles of Integration\nEmbedded, Not Added: Integrate climate resilience into market research, finances, business modeling, operations.\nReal-World Examples: Use local Iraqi/KRI or international case studies.\nFlexibility & Feasibility: Show small, cost-effective changes that can scale over time.\nRisk Management: Train businesses to monitor and adjust to environmental/economic risks.\n(C) ILO Green Business Booklet References (pp. 7-9, 21-26, 25, 12-16, 30)\np.7-9: Resource efficiency as a competitiveness advantage\np.12-16: Environmental impact assessment, triple bottom line approach\np.21-26: Guidelines for greening operations & supply chains\np.25: Greening checklist for prototyping/materials\np.30: Criteria for selecting eco-friendly solutions\n(D) Curriculum Review Comments & Clusters\nMarket & Business Opportunity\n\nIdentifying demand for green solutions, positioning sustainability as competitive advantage\nProduct & Service Design\n\nConsidering materials, energy efficiency, circular economy\nOperations & Supply Chain\n\nChoosing green processes, sustainable procurement, transport efficiency\nCustomer Research & Understanding\n\nSurveying environmental concerns, mapping sustainability-related touchpoints\nFinancial Considerations\n\nCalculating costs of green investments, identifying special funds/incentives\nStrategic Planning & Risk Management\n\nIncluding climate risks in business plans, triple bottom line, environmental impact assessments\nNetworking & Partnerships\n\nConnecting with sustainability networks, environmental experts, success stories (like KESK)\nIV. Final Notes on Using This Process\nKeep the Flow: This 4-stage approach ensures minimal disruption:\nStage 1 quickly finds existing references\nStage 2 scores them\nStage 3 proposes targeted text changes\nStage 4 logs everything for future reference\nLeverage the BEW: Always direct participants to reflect or track risk/efficiency actions in the Business Efficiency Workbook.\nValidate & Iterate: If you have time, re-run updated slides in the LLM for a final check, then record final scores in the Scoring & Integration Tracker.\nDone—you’ll have a clean, auditable approach for each module, preserving the original material’s spirit while maximally integrating climate resilience as part of smart business strategy."

Participants learn to define customer problems, brainstorm creative solutions, and prototype ideas quickly.\n\nKey Activities or Components:\nActivities include icebreakers, brainstorming, rapid prototyping, user interviews, and feedback loops. The \"Yes, And\" and \"No\" brainstorming methods encourage divergent and convergent thinking. The design sprint allows participants to apply design thinking in a condensed format.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\nBy the end of the module, participants should be able to understand user needs, define key challenges, generate creative solutions, and develop rapid prototypes. The module fosters collaboration, empathy, and problem-solving skills that can be applied to entrepreneurship.\n\nTask 2: Existing Elements Analysis\nSection/Slide\tCurrent Reference\tType of Reference\tPotential Enhancement\nDesign Sprint Intro (Slide 5)\t\"We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources.\"\tResource Efficiency\tExpand this to explicitly mention sustainable design and low-impact solutions. Example: \"Mindful of resources, including energy efficiency, material reuse, and climate impact.\"\nBrainstorming (Slide 15)\t\"What if it had to be made from recycled materials?\"\tSustainability\tStrengthen this by incorporating local renewable resources and circular economy principles. Example: \"What if it had to be made from materials that minimize environmental impact in Iraq/KRI?\"\nPrototyping (Slide 16)\t\"Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\"\tSustainability, Local Context\tAdd a section on biodegradable materials, low-carbon-footprint designs, or water-efficient solutions relevant to Iraq’s climate challenges.\nFeedback & Debrief (Slide 17)\t\"Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\"\tResource Efficiency\tIncorporate climate resilience by asking: \"Would this solution still work in extreme heat, water scarcity, or unreliable electricity?\"\nNon-Linear Process (Slide 18)\t\"Reframing customer problems for better solutions\"\tRisk Management, Long-Term Planning\tIntroduce climate adaptation scenarios: \"How might climate change affect customer needs over the next 10 years?\"\nTask 3: Integration Opportunities\nSection/Slide\tCurrent Content\tIntegration Opportunity\tReasoning\n\"Yes, And\" Icebreaker (Slide 4)\tProblem-solving activity (rain, heat, transportation issues)\tIntroduce climate resilience challenges (e.g., How do we reduce extreme heat in public spaces?)\tHelps normalize climate considerations from the start of the program.\nUser Research (Slide 13)\tInterviewing users about their morning routine\tInclude questions about climate impacts on daily life (e.g., How does heat or power outages affect your work?)\tEncourages entrepreneurs to consider real-world climate-related challenges.\nDefine the Problem (Slide 14)\tReframing customer needs using verbs instead of nouns\tReframe needs related to climate adaptation (e.g., \"We need to stay cool in summer\" → \"We need to regulate temperature efficiently\")\tLeads to more sustainable, long-term solutions.\nPrototyping (Slide 16)\tUsing recycled/local materials\tEmphasize climate-smart solutions (e.g., passive cooling, rainwater harvesting, energy-efficient designs)\tEnsures solutions align with sustainable infrastructure.\nFeedback & Debrief (Slide 17)\tTesting ideas with a partner\tIntroduce a climate-resilience checklist: \"Does your solution consider energy use, waste reduction, or climate adaptability?\"\tEmbeds sustainability thinking into product development.\nNext Steps\nTo integrate climate resilience effectively, consider:\n\nFraming climate resilience as an entrepreneurial opportunity—help participants see the business potential in solving climate-related challenges.\nAdding climate-specific brainstorming prompts—e.g., “How can this product work in high temperatures or without reliable electricity?”\nEmbedding climate awareness into prototyping and feedback—encourage solutions that are sustainable, resilient, and relevant to Iraq/KRI’s context.\n"

Today is all about getting to know each other, understanding the program, and setting the foundations for the next two weeks as you learn more about the market and your customers needs!\n1\n\n\n\nLET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER\u000b\n Name?\n Where you are from?\n Tell us your idea.\n What’s your superpower?\n10 minutes: Share\n\nIntroductions:\nBefore we get started, I would like to introduce myself and get to know all of you a bit better. Let's quickly go around the room and share:\nYour name,\nWhere you are from,\nTell us a little bit about your idea. \nAnd finally, if you had a superpower, what would it be (flying, reading minds, shape shifting, etc…)?\n\nThe trainers should start first. Then, go around the room so each person can introduce themselves.\n2\n\n09:00 am \t\tWelcome + Introductions!\n09:30 am\t\tFive One Labs & Ignite\n10:30 am\t\tDesign Sprint \n12:00 pm\t\tGroup Lunch\n01:30 pm\t\tUser Research \n04:30 pm\t\tWrap up\nAGENDA\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nAgenda: Now that we all know each other a little better, let’s get into the agenda for the day. \nThis morning we will spend some time understanding Five One Labs, the program, and what exactly you will be doing over the two weeks. This will be an opportunity to clarify any questions you still have and give you some insights on what is in store ahead through a design sprint!\nGroup Lunch: At 12:00 we will take a break and get lunch together. \nThis afternoon we will come back and get into user research. This is the first major session we will have. Here we will define our research plan for the next few weeks! Tell us a little bit about your idea, what problem does it solve? Finally, we will wrap up around 4:30!\n\n3\n\nYES, AND….\n15 minutes: Icebreaker \n\n2 minutes: Explain the activity\nTrainers should conduct the “YES, AND…” Icebreaker\nMake teams of about 3-5\nState a problem or ask the group for a problem \nFor example:\nIt’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nIt is so hot outside, how can I get to and from work without sweating or ever feeling the heat?\n \n5 minutes: “No” technique:\nYou have 2 minutes to generate different crazy ideas to solve that problem. Generate as many as possible. But there is a rule! When one member in the team says an idea another one must say “no!” and come up with a completely different idea. This goes on and on until the 2 minutes are up. You have to do this quickly, let's see how many crazy ideas we will get.\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nUse an umbrella!\nNo! Build a tunnel to go directly inside!\nNo! make a waterproof suit that covers your whole body!\nNo! Build an overpass that my taxi/bus will drop me off under!\nNo! Have a drone float above my head to prevent water from touching me.\nNo!.....\n[2 minutes pass] Time is done!\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with.\n \n5 minutes: Now let’s try “yes and”: \nYou have 2 minutes again, and this time someone says an idea, and then someone else in the group must say “yes”, and add a feature to grow the idea to make the idea bigger. Is it clear? Let's do it\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nBuild a tunnel to go directly inside from where you get dropped off!\nYes! And have heat inside to keep you warm on cold days\nYes! And the heat system is controlled by an app on your phone that you can use to control the temperature where you are walking\nYes! And …..\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with\n\n3 minutes: Review + recap\nAsk them which one did they like and why? (yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more. \nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint!

Starting this afternoon, we will talk about applying the Design Thinking methodology to your business.\nUser Research: We will go into creating a research plan for you to deeply understand your customers and their needs.\nReframe: Define the Problem: We will take all of our research, and clearly define the problem for your different customer types.\nCreativity and Ideation: Finally, we will generate solutions to your customers problems. Some of them might be your current ideas, but we hope to generate a wide variety of ideas that could all be potential solutions. \n6\n\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is design thinking? Why is it useful?\nPotential answers:\nA way to take a messy problem and turn it into something much more clear and more ordered\nA way to enhance your creativity, build stronger, more innovative solutions\nTo build a deeper understanding of people \nHuman centered, iterative, collaborative, experiential \nThere is a bias towards action\nYou should work to embody these mindsets throughout the rest of this sprint\n\n7\n\nincreased creativity\nstronger solutions\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe trainer should recap points brought up on the previous slide answering “What is design thinking?

(gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!!

Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief \nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out? \nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable?

The core learning objectives are:\n\nUnderstanding the design thinking process and its application in problem-solving\nConducting user research to identify real customer needs\nIdeating, prototyping, and iterating on solutions\nKey activities include icebreakers, a design sprint, user research, brainstorming, and rapid prototyping. Participants engage in a hands-on one-hour design thinking exercise, which simulates the full process. Current outcomes emphasize increased creativity, problem-framing skills, and iterative design approaches, but lack explicit climate resilience components.\n\nTask 2: Climate Integration Analysis\nLocation\tCurrent Activity\tSuggested Change\tLocal Context & Reasoning\nSlide 4 - Design Sprint Introduction\tIntroduction to design thinking and the sprint process\tIntroduce climate-conscious design thinking, emphasizing how sustainable solutions are a part of problem-solving.\tIraq/KRI faces severe climate stress, including rising temperatures, water scarcity, and desertification. Embedding climate resilience in design solutions ensures that businesses are future-proof.\nSlide 7 - What is Design Thinking?\tDiscusses the role of design thinking in problem-solving and innovation\tAdd climate-focused case studies (e.g., designing businesses that minimize waste, use renewable energy, or adapt to extreme weather)\tEntrepreneurs in Iraq/KRI need to integrate sustainability early to navigate climate challenges and remain competitive in green markets.\nSlide 9 - Define a Clear Problem\tEncourages defining customer needs using verbs, not just nouns\tAdd a climate-resilience example: Instead of \"we need more electricity,\" reframe as \"we need to reduce energy waste.\"\tMany regions in Iraq suffer from energy crises and inefficient resource use—businesses can innovate by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and increasing efficiency.\nSlide 12 - Interview Activity\tParticipants interview their partners about morning routines\tAdd an environmental behavior component: Ask how participants' routines impact climate (e.g., energy use, transportation choices, waste).\tMany small businesses and households in Iraq rely on inefficient energy consumption and high plastic use—raising awareness can shift habits.\nSlide 15 - Brainstorming\tGenerating 5+ solutions to a partner’s problem\tIntroduce a climate constraint: What if the solution must be made from recycled or locally sourced materials? How can the business idea minimize waste?\tIraq has a waste management crisis—entrepreneurs should design with sustainability in mind from the outset.\nSlide 16 - Prototype Activity\tParticipants build a prototype using diverse materials\tEnsure that materials available for prototyping include eco-friendly, biodegradable, or upcycled options.\tThis encourages an early resource-conscious mindset—Iraq’s infrastructure cannot handle excessive industrial waste.\nSlide 17 - Feedback\tParticipants test prototypes and gather feedback\tAdd a climate-conscious reflection question: Could your solution work with fewer resources or less environmental impact?\tBusinesses that prioritize sustainability have a market advantage, especially as Iraq explores renewable energy initiatives.\nSlide 18 - Wrap-up\tReview of the design thinking process\tConclude by emphasizing that innovation includes resilience—climate change will define future market needs, and businesses should adapt proactively.\tClimate adaptation is not optional—entrepreneurs who consider sustainability early will outlast those who don’t.\nFinal Recommendations\nExplicit Climate Framing\n\nIntroduce sustainability as a design principle at the start.\nUse local examples (e.g., businesses tackling water scarcity, extreme heat solutions, waste reduction).\nClimate-Conscious Brainstorming & Prototyping\n\nAdd eco-constraints during ideation (e.g., \"How would this work in a low-water environment?\").\nEnsure green materials are available for prototyping.\nBusiness Model Resilience\n\nEncourage participants to future-proof their ideas by considering climate risks and market demands for sustainability.\nBy embedding climate resilience into design thinking, this module can prepare Iraqi entrepreneurs to build businesses that thrive in an uncertain future. 🚀\n\n11:40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nStage 2: Module Scoring Prompt\nINSTRUCTIONS\nYou are a curriculum consultant specializing in integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training.

By embedding sustainability principles into exercises (e.g., prototyping with green materials, defining problems with climate impact in mind), the module can equip entrepreneurs to build future-proof businesses in Iraq/KRI.\n\n🚀 With a few targeted improvements, this can become a powerful climate-resilient entrepreneurship module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYou are a curriculum consultant implementing climate resilience improvements in entrepreneurship training. Using the previous analyses and focusing on high-priority items, provide specific implementation recommendations.\n\n\nTask: Create Implementation Plan\nGenerate three clear tables:\nTable 1: Content Changes\nLocationCurrent TextRevised TextImplementation Notes[Slide/section][Existing content][New content][Specific guidance for facilitators]\nTable 2: Activity Modifications\nActivityCurrent FormatSuggested ModificationLocal Context Integration[Activity name][How it works now][Specific changes][How it connects to Iraq/KRI]\nTable 3: Resource Needs\nResource TypeCurrent StatusNeeded AdditionPurpose[Worksheet/Tool/Example][What exists][What to add][Why it's needed]\nGuidelines:\n\nFocus on highest priority improvements from Stage 2\nKeep changes minimal but impactful\nProvide specific, actionable guidance\nInclude clear facilitator notes\nReference local context where possible\nOnly suggest new resources if essential\nChatGPT said:\nImplementation Plan for Climate Resilience Integration in Entrepreneurship Training\nThis plan focuses on high-priority improvements to ensure climate resilience is embedded into the Design Thinking module without disrupting the core structure. The changes are minimal but impactful, ensuring entrepreneurs develop sustainable business models.\n\nTable 1: Content Changes\nLocation\tCurrent Text\tRevised Text\tImplementation Notes\nSlide 4 - Design Sprint Introduction\t\"We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources.\"\t\"We’ll think about creative solutions that are resource-conscious, climate-resilient, and mindful of sustainability challenges.\"\tAdd a 1-minute mention that businesses must consider how climate change and resource availability impact their solutions.\nSlide 7 - What is Design Thinking?\tNo mention of sustainability\t\"Design Thinking helps entrepreneurs solve messy problems. In today’s world, this includes climate resilience, energy efficiency, and sustainable solutions.\"\tFacilitators should give a quick example, e.g., how water scarcity in Iraq creates business opportunities for low-water agriculture startups.\nSlide 9 - Define a Clear Problem\t\"Instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste.’\"\t\"Instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to generate clean energy and reduce waste.’\"\tHighlight renewable energy solutions, e.g., solar startups in Iraq.\nSlide 15 - Brainstorming\t\"Use creative constraints to help your imagination. What if it had to be a physical object? What if it had to be made from recycled materials?\"\t\"Use creative constraints: What if it had to be carbon-neutral? What if it had to be resilient in extreme heat? What if it relied on local, recycled materials?\"\tFacilitators should encourage green innovation, such as products that reduce heat stress or use sustainable materials.\nSlide 16 - Prototype Activity\t\"Offer a diverse range of materials.\"\t\"Offer sustainable, locally sourced, and recycled materials.\"\tEnsure that prototyping supplies include eco-friendly options (e.g., biodegradable materials, recycled plastic, locally available natural fibers).\nTable 2: Activity Modifications\nActivity\tCurrent Format\tSuggested Modification\tLocal Context Integration\nDefine the Problem (Slide 14)\tParticipants define their problem statement\tAdd a climate-resilience question: \"How might this problem be impacted by climate change?\"\tIraq is facing water shortages, extreme heat, and pollution—encourage entrepreneurs to factor these into their problem statements.\nBrainstorming (Slide 15)\tParticipants generate at least five ideas\tIntroduce a climate constraint: \"How can your idea be more sustainable? Reduce energy use? Minimize waste?\"\tIraq’s energy grid is unreliable—businesses that reduce energy use are more resilient and cost-effective.\nPrototype (Slide 16)\tTeams create a prototype using available materials\tRequire at least one sustainability feature in each prototype (e.g., recyclable materials, energy efficiency).\tEncourages businesses to design with sustainability in mind from the start.\nFeedback & Iteration (Slide 17)\tParticipants receive peer feedback\tAdd sustainability-focused feedback questions: \"How can this idea reduce waste? Use fewer resources? Adapt to extreme weather?\"\tHelps businesses develop eco-conscious products that meet local challenges.\nTable 3: Resource Needs\nResource Type\tCurrent Status\tNeeded Addition\tPurpose\nWorksheet: Climate Resilience Questions for Entrepreneurs\tNo existing worksheet on climate resilience\t1-page worksheet with questions like: \"How will this business operate in extreme heat?\" \"Can it use less water?\" \"What eco-friendly materials could it use?\"\tHelps entrepreneurs embed sustainability early in their business models.\nCase Study: Sustainable Iraqi Startups\tNo local climate-related case studies\t2-3 brief case studies of Iraqi/KRI startups using green innovation, such as solar energy, water-efficient agriculture, or eco-friendly packaging\tShows real-world examples of businesses succeeding with sustainability principles.\nPrototyping Materials\tGeneral materials available\tEnsure locally sourced, upcycled, and biodegradable materials are included\tHelps normalize sustainability in product design and reduces waste in exercises.\nFacilitator Guide: Climate-Smart Design Thinking\tNo climate adaptation guide for trainers\t1-page guide with talking points on integrating sustainability into design thinking\tHelps facilitators confidently embed climate resilience without needing expert knowledge.\nFinal Steps for Implementation\n✅ Update slide content with minor but impactful wording changes\n✅ Modify activities to encourage climate-resilient business ideas\n✅ Add essential resources (worksheet, case study, and facilitator guide)\n✅ Ensure sustainable prototyping materials are available\n\nBy making these small but strategic improvements, the entrepreneurship training module will embed climate resilience while maintaining its interactive, problem-solving approach. 🚀]]]\ni want it operationalizable"

Today is all about getting to know each other, understanding the program, and setting the foundations for the next two weeks as you learn more about the market and your customers needs!\n1\n\n\n\nLET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER\u000b\n Name?\n Where you are from?\n Tell us your idea.\n What’s your superpower?\n10 minutes: Share\n\nIntroductions:\nBefore we get started, I would like to introduce myself and get to know all of you a bit better. Let's quickly go around the room and share:\nYour name,\nWhere you are from,\nTell us a little bit about your idea. \nAnd finally, if you had a superpower, what would it be (flying, reading minds, shape shifting, etc…)?\n\nThe trainers should start first. Then, go around the room so each person can introduce themselves.\n2\n\n09:00 am \t\tWelcome + Introductions!\n09:30 am\t\tFive One Labs & Ignite\n10:30 am\t\tDesign Sprint \n12:00 pm\t\tGroup Lunch\n01:30 pm\t\tUser Research \n04:30 pm\t\tWrap up\nAGENDA\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nAgenda: Now that we all know each other a little better, let’s get into the agenda for the day. \nThis morning we will spend some time understanding Five One Labs, the program, and what exactly you will be doing over the two weeks. This will be an opportunity to clarify any questions you still have and give you some insights on what is in store ahead through a design sprint!\nGroup Lunch: At 12:00 we will take a break and get lunch together. \nThis afternoon we will come back and get into user research. This is the first major session we will have. Here we will define our research plan for the next few weeks! Tell us a little bit about your idea, what problem does it solve? Finally, we will wrap up around 4:30!\n\n3\n\nYES, AND….\n15 minutes: Icebreaker \n\n2 minutes: Explain the activity\nTrainers should conduct the “YES, AND…” Icebreaker\nMake teams of about 3-5\nState a problem or ask the group for a problem \nFor example:\nIt’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nIt is so hot outside, how can I get to and from work without sweating or ever feeling the heat?\n \n5 minutes: “No” technique:\nYou have 2 minutes to generate different crazy ideas to solve that problem. Generate as many as possible. But there is a rule! When one member in the team says an idea another one must say “no!” and come up with a completely different idea. This goes on and on until the 2 minutes are up. You have to do this quickly, let's see how many crazy ideas we will get.\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nUse an umbrella!\nNo! Build a tunnel to go directly inside!\nNo! make a waterproof suit that covers your whole body!\nNo! Build an overpass that my taxi/bus will drop me off under!\nNo! Have a drone float above my head to prevent water from touching me.\nNo!.....\n[2 minutes pass] Time is done!\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with.\n \n5 minutes: Now let’s try “yes and”: \nYou have 2 minutes again, and this time someone says an idea, and then someone else in the group must say “yes”, and add a feature to grow the idea to make the idea bigger. Is it clear? Let's do it\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nBuild a tunnel to go directly inside from where you get dropped off!\nYes! And have heat inside to keep you warm on cold days\nYes! And the heat system is controlled by an app on your phone that you can use to control the temperature where you are walking\nYes! And …..\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with\n\n3 minutes: Review + recap\nAsk them which one did they like and why? (yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more. \nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint!

(gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!! (alone)\n Offer a diverse range of materials, encourage resource consciousness by providing local, recycled, and green materials.\n Send the entrepreneurs in the other room where prototyping supplies are laid out for them.\n How might this solution fit into the context of your partner’s life? \n Improve and build out the concept you talked about\n17\n\nFEEDBACK\n20 minutes: Activity\n\n6 minutes: Feedback (3 mins each) \nRemember, your idea is not precious, feedback is just a way to learn more\nGenerate more feedback\nWrite down how they feel about it\nWatch how they use it, misuse it, what mistakes are they making, what doesn’t make sense, etc\nWrite down one new idea, one big question from feedback. Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?\n \n10 minutes: Debrief \nHow did discussing and gathering feedback from the person change how your final solution looks?\nIf you had to make it for yourself, would it look the same as it did for your partner?\nWho ended up with something their partner really liked? Why? What about it stood out? \nWhat would you change in your next iteration?\nWhat part was most uncomfortable? What was most natural? \nHow was it as a user interacting with the prototype? \n\n18\n\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nBriefly explain again how they just went through the whole design thinking process in under an hour\nExplain that during Ignite, we will go through the first 3 steps, and then the incubator we will do the last 2 steps\nWrap up for lunch\n\n19\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nAny Questions?]]]\n\nChatGPT said:\nHere's a structured analysis of the module with a focus on climate resilience integration.\n\nTask 1: Module Summary\nThe Design Thinking module introduces participants to the human-centered design process, helping them develop innovative solutions to complex problems. The core learning objectives are:\n\nUnderstanding the design thinking process and its application in problem-solving\nConducting user research to identify real customer needs\nIdeating, prototyping, and iterating on solutions\nKey activities include icebreakers, a design sprint, user research, brainstorming, and rapid prototyping. Participants engage in a hands-on one-hour design thinking exercise, which simulates the full process. Current outcomes emphasize increased creativity, problem-framing skills, and iterative design approaches, but lack explicit climate resilience components.\n\nTask 2: Climate Integration Analysis\nLocation\tCurrent Activity\tSuggested Change\tLocal Context & Reasoning\nSlide 4 - Design Sprint Introduction\tIntroduction to design thinking and the sprint process\tIntroduce climate-conscious design thinking, emphasizing how sustainable solutions are a part of problem-solving.\tIraq/KRI faces severe climate stress, including rising temperatures, water scarcity, and desertification. Embedding climate resilience in design solutions ensures that businesses are future-proof.\nSlide 7 - What is Design Thinking?\tDiscusses the role of design thinking in problem-solving and innovation\tAdd climate-focused case studies (e.g., designing businesses that minimize waste, use renewable energy, or adapt to extreme weather)\tEntrepreneurs in Iraq/KRI need to integrate sustainability early to navigate climate challenges and remain competitive in green markets.\nSlide 9 - Define a Clear Problem\tEncourages defining customer needs using verbs, not just nouns\tAdd a climate-resilience example: Instead of \"we need more electricity,\" reframe as \"we need to reduce energy waste.\"\tMany regions in Iraq suffer from energy crises and inefficient resource use—businesses can innovate by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and increasing efficiency.\nSlide 12 - Interview Activity\tParticipants interview their partners about morning routines\tAdd an environmental behavior component: Ask how participants' routines impact climate (e.g., energy use, transportation choices, waste).\tMany small businesses and households in Iraq rely on inefficient energy consumption and high plastic use—raising awareness can shift habits.\nSlide 15 - Brainstorming\tGenerating 5+ solutions to a partner’s problem\tIntroduce a climate constraint: What if the solution must be made from recycled or locally sourced materials? How can the business idea minimize waste?\tIraq has a waste management crisis—entrepreneurs should design with sustainability in mind from the outset.\nSlide 16 - Prototype Activity\tParticipants build a prototype using diverse materials\tEnsure that materials available for prototyping include eco-friendly, biodegradable, or upcycled options.\tThis encourages an early resource-conscious mindset—Iraq’s infrastructure cannot handle excessive industrial waste.\nSlide 17 - Feedback\tParticipants test prototypes and gather feedback\tAdd a climate-conscious reflection question: Could your solution work with fewer resources or less environmental impact?\tBusinesses that prioritize sustainability have a market advantage, especially as Iraq explores renewable energy initiatives.\nSlide 18 - Wrap-up\tReview of the design thinking process\tConclude by emphasizing that innovation includes resilience—climate change will define future market needs, and businesses should adapt proactively.\tClimate adaptation is not optional—entrepreneurs who consider sustainability early will outlast those who don’t.\nFinal Recommendations\nExplicit Climate Framing\n\nIntroduce sustainability as a design principle at the start.\nUse local examples (e.g., businesses tackling water scarcity, extreme heat solutions, waste reduction).\nClimate-Conscious Brainstorming & Prototyping\n\nAdd eco-constraints during ideation (e.g., \"How would this work in a low-water environment?\").\nEnsure green materials are available for prototyping.\nBusiness Model Resilience\n\nEncourage participants to future-proof their ideas by considering climate risks and market demands for sustainability.\nBy embedding climate resilience into design thinking, this module can prepare Iraqi entrepreneurs to build businesses that thrive in an uncertain future. 🚀\n\n11:40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nStage 2: Module Scoring Prompt\nINSTRUCTIONS\nYou are a curriculum consultant specializing in integrating climate resilience into entrepreneurship training.
