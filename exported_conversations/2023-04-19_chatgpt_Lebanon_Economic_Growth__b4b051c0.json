Many of the Lebanese population have already taken that step and started their own small scale Agro-food and Mounet production, and many are now eligible to take their business a step further and produce on a bigger scale and cater to a larger market. \n",

Given the unsustainability of the current agri-food production, processing, distribution and consumption patterns, and the inadequate governance of the whole food system, the transition to sustainable agriculture and food systems has become crucial to effectively manage a global agri-food market able in supporting expected population growth and ensuring universal access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food for all. Based on a critical review of the existing international literature, the paper seeks to understand the evolutionary paths of sustainability issues within agri-food markets by analyzing their drivers and trends. An extensive analysis was conducted highlighting the development and importance of the body of knowledge on the most important sustainability transition frameworks, focusing mainly on the relationship between markets, trade, food and nutrition security, and other emerging issues within agri-food markets. Finally, the study makes suggestions to extend the research in order to improve basic knowledge and to identify opportunities to design meaningful actions that can shape agri-food markets and foster their transition to sustainability.\nKeywords: sustainability transitions; short food supply chains; alternative food networks; food systems; food security; nutrition; food policy; globalization; liberalization\n1. Introduction\n\nMarkets can be viewed as the “collective devices that allow compromises to be reached, not only on the nature of goods to produce and distribute but also on the value to be given to them” [1] (p. 1229). The main function of markets is the exchange of value based on context-specific rules that are shaped by public regulations, cultural customs, civic norms and/or private contracts [2]. In particular, agri-food markets aggregate demand and supply across space and time throughout the entire food system from input supply to farm production, collection, processing, packaging, transportation, including the final consumption of retail food products [3,4]. Summarizing, agri-food markets concern the totality of the complex production, transformation and distribution activities making it possible for a crop to be consumed by eaters [5,6]. Therefore, they perform multiple fundamental functions and play a crucial role in the process of economic development [3].\nNowadays, agri-food systems and markets are under unprecedented confluence of different pressures [7]. Indeed, they are at the center of an interconnection of global environmental, economic, and social problems, and are critical in dealing with various sustainability challenges such as climate change, population growth, food insecurity and malnutrition, resource scarcity, ecosystem degradation, and biodiversity loss [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19].\nThe importance of markets—in general and in the agri-food system in particular—in achieving sustainable development is demonstrated by the fact that they are mentioned in the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [20]. In particular, three targets of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 ‘Zero Hunger’ deal with agri-food markets and their functioning:\nTarget 2.3: By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment.\nTarget 2.b: Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.\nTarget 2.c: Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.\nThe achievement of these targets (as well as of others in different SDGs) in order to meet universal human standards calls for a radical rethinking of worldwide food production and consumption patterns. Gerten et al. [21] state that “If planetary boundaries were maintained ceteris paribus (without concurrent transition towards more sustainable production and consumption), present agricultural practices could sustain only 3.4 billion people” (p. 3). Moreover, they argue that “redirecting global food production and consumption onto more sustainable pathways could […] increase […] food supply to a level sufficient for 10.2 billion people” [21] (p. 3). Therefore, agri-food sectors have to increase their production—as food production must be increased (by 60%–110% from 2005) to meet the expected increase in global population and food demand by 2050 [22,23]—while simultaneously decreasing the negative impact of this production and distribution [24,25,26,27].\nIn the context of the new development agenda, the relationship between markets, trade, food security, and nutrition is attracting increased attention. Facing the significantly growing global food demand and the changes in overall nutritional needs, meeting higher quality standards (safety, environment, welfare and ethics) and keeping food affordable are key challenges to the world [25,28,29].\nThis review takes part to the current debate on the sustainability of modern agri-food markets and their development by addressing issues and topics covered by the existing international literature. In particular, the review provides a framework about some recent advancements in literature regarding most prominent sustainability transition frameworks with a focus on implications for trade, food security and other emerging issues within agri-food markets, that are likely to shape the direction of future research in this area.",

The number of publications on FVCs and RFHs is increasing, indicating that these topics are gaining interest among scholars from different countries and disciplines. Bibliometric analysis and preferred reporting items for systematic review and a meta-analysis (PRISMA) flow chart are used to identify the data from Scopus. The results show that FVCs are an innovative solution to improve the skills and capacity of smallholder farmers through collaborative networks that can match the functions of RFHs. RFHs connect local producers and customers by operating a business based on social entrepreneurship and ecological approaches to increase local economic viability and the sustainability of agriculture products. FVCs and RFHs are designed to respond to supply chain insecurity with value-based approaches in order to achieve sustainable nutrition for the local community. Further research on FVCs and RFHs emphasizes that the business model of regional development in developing countries can improve food security sustainability based on social entrepreneurship, and emphasizes the environmental aspect that it can use to support the sustainability of developing countries local food.\nKeywords: sustainability; food value chain; regional food hub; local competitiveness; alternative strategy\n\n",
