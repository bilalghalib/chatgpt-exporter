      "content": "### Script to Clean JSON Data\n\nLet's create a Python script that extracts valid JSON data from a text file with comments and other random text. The script will focus on identifying and extracting valid JSON structures while ignoring extraneous content.\n\nHere's a sample script to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport re\n\ndef extract_json_from_text(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract valid JSON objects from a given text.\n\n    Parameters:\n    text (str): The input text containing JSON objects and other random text.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of valid JSON objects extracted from the text.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use regular expression to find potential JSON objects\n    json_pattern = re.compile(r'\\{.*?\\}', re.DOTALL)\n    json_objects = []\n    \n    matches = json_pattern.findall(text)\n    for match in matches:\n        try:\n            json_obj = json.loads(match)\n            json_objects.append(json_obj)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            continue  # Skip invalid JSON\n\n    return json_objects\n\ndef main():\n    input_text = \"\"\"\n    Note: The edge descriptions are concise summaries of the relationships between the terms.\n\n    ERROR ### Here is the buggy response:  Here is the extracted ontology with their relations:\n\n    [\n       {\n           \"node_1\": \"Growth\",\n           \"node_2\": \"Development\",\n           \"edge\": \"growth and development are related concepts that support individual learning\"\n       },\n       {\n           \"node_1\": \"Albert Bandura\",\n           \"node_2\": \"Dewey\",\n           \"edge\": \"Bandura and Dewey have a copyretry relationship, as they both share their perspectives on AI-assisted learning\"\n       },\n       ...\n    ]\n\n    Note: The edge descriptions are concise summaries of the relationships between the terms. \n    ...\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Extract JSON objects from the input text\n    json_objects = extract_json_from_text(input_text)\n    \n    # Combine the extracted JSON objects into a single JSON array\n    final_json = json.dumps(json_objects, indent=4)\n    \n    # Save the final JSON to a file\n    with open('cleaned_data.json', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(final_json)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Regular Expression**: The `re.compile(r'\\{.*?\\}', re.DOTALL)` pattern is used to find potential JSON objects enclosed in curly braces. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the `.` to match newline characters, ensuring multi-line JSON objects are captured.\n\n- **JSON Validation**: Each match is attempted to be loaded as a JSON object using `json.loads()`. If it fails, the script skips that match.\n\n- **Output**: The valid JSON objects are combined into a single JSON array and written to `cleaned_data.json`.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Copy the script into a Python file, e.g., `clean_json.py`.\n2. Run the script using `python clean_json.py`.\n3. The cleaned JSON data will be saved in `cleaned_data.json`.\n\nThis approach ensures that only valid JSON structures are retained while ignoring any other text.",

Save the script to a Python file, e.g., `clean_json.py`.\n2. Prepare your input text file, e.g., `input.txt`.\n3. Run the script from the command line, specifying the input file and output directory:\n   ```bash\n   python clean_json.py input.txt output_directory\n   ```\n4. When prompted, enter a filename or press Enter to use the default. If no input is provided within 10 seconds, the default filename will be used.\n\nThis will extract the valid JSON objects from `input.txt`, save them to `clean_json.json`, and also save them as `clean_json.csv` with an additional `chunk_id` column in the specified output directory.",

Below is the updated script that includes a feature to extract conceptual neighborhoods from a text block and save them as a JSON variable named \"Conceptual Space.\" Additionally, the script will prompt the user for an output file name, defaulting to 'clean_json' if no input is provided within 10 seconds.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport re\nimport argparse\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport hashlib\nimport signal\n\nclass TimeoutExpired(Exception):\n    pass\n\ndef timeout_handler(signum, frame):\n    raise TimeoutExpired\n\n# Set the signal handler for timeout\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)\n\ndef extract_json_from_text(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract valid JSON objects from a given text.\n\n    Parameters:\n    text (str): The input text containing JSON objects and other random text.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list of valid JSON objects extracted from the text.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use regular expression to find potential JSON objects\n    json_pattern = re.compile(r'\\{.*?\\}', re.DOTALL)\n    json_objects = []\n    \n    matches = json_pattern.findall(text)\n    for match in matches:\n        try:\n            json_obj = json.loads(match)\n            # Generate a hash for the chunk_id\n            chunk_id = hashlib.md5(match.encode()).hexdigest()\n            json_obj[\"chunk_id\"] = chunk_id\n            json_objects.append(json_obj)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            continue  # Skip invalid JSON\n\n    return json_objects\n\ndef extract_conceptual_space(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract conceptual neighborhoods from a given text block.\n\n    Parameters:\n    text (str): The input text containing conceptual neighborhoods.\n\n    Returns:\n    dict: A dictionary representing the conceptual space.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use regular expression to find all concepts within brackets\n    concept_pattern = re.compile(r'\\[.*?\\]', re.DOTALL)\n    matches = concept_pattern.findall(text)\n\n    # Clean the matches and create the conceptual space dictionary\n    conceptual_space = {\"all concepts\": []}\n    for match in matches:\n        # Remove brackets and split by commas\n        concepts = match.strip('[]').split(', ')\n        conceptual_space[\"all concepts\"].append(concepts)\n\n    return conceptual_space\n\ndef main(input_file, output_directory):\n    # Read the input text file\n    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:\n        input_text = file.read()\n    \n    # Extract JSON objects from the input text\n    json_objects = extract_json_from_text(input_text)\n    \n    # Extract conceptual space from the input text\n    conceptual_space = extract_conceptual_space(input_text)\n    \n    # Combine the extracted JSON objects into a single JSON array\n    final_json = json.dumps(json_objects, indent=4)\n    \n    # Save the final JSON to a file\n    output_directory = Path(output_directory)\n    output_directory.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n    \n    json_output_file = output_directory / 'cleaned_data.json'\n    with open(json_output_file, 'w') as f:\n        f.write(final_json)\n    \n    print(f\"Cleaned JSON data has been saved to {json_output_file}\")\n\n    # Save the JSON objects to a CSV file\n    if json_objects:\n        df = pd.DataFrame(json_objects)\n        csv_output_file = output_directory / 'graph.csv'\n        df.to_csv(csv_output_file, sep='|', index=False)\n        print(f\"CSV data has been saved to {csv_output_file}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No valid JSON objects found to save to CSV.\")\n\n    # Save the conceptual space to a JSON file\n    conceptual_space_file = output_directory / 'conceptual_space.json'\n    with open(conceptual_space_file, 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(conceptual_space, f, indent=4)\n    print(f\"Conceptual space data has been saved to {conceptual_space_file}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Set up argument parser\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Extract valid JSON objects and conceptual space from a text file.')\n    parser.add_argument('input_file', type=str, help='The path to the input text file')\n    parser.add_argument('output_directory', type=str, help='The directory where the output files will be saved')\n    \n    # Parse arguments\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n    \n    # Prompt for the output filename with a timeout of 10 seconds\n    output_filename = 'clean_json'\n    print(\"Please enter the output filename (default is 'clean_json'):\")\n    \n    try:\n        signal.alarm(10)\n        output_filename = input()\n        signal.alarm(0)\n    except TimeoutExpired:\n        print(\"\\nTimeout reached, using default output filename 'clean_json'.\")\n\n    # Run the main function with the provided input file and output directory\n    main(args.input_file, args.output_directory)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Timeout Handling**: The script prompts for an output filename and waits for 10 seconds for user input. If no input is provided within this time, it defaults to 'clean_json'.\n- **Conceptual Space Extraction**: The `extract_conceptual_space` function extracts concepts from brackets in the text and organizes them into a dictionary under the key \"all concepts\".\n- **Saving Outputs**: The script saves the cleaned JSON data, CSV data, and conceptual space JSON data to the specified output directory.\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Save the script to a Python file, e.g., `clean_json.py`.\n2. Prepare your input text file, e.g., `input.txt`.\n3. Run the script from the command line, specifying the input file and output directory:\n   ```bash\n   python clean_json.py input.txt output_directory\n   ```\n4. When prompted, enter an output filename or wait for 10 seconds to use the default.\n\nThis script will extract valid JSON objects, conceptual neighborhoods, and save them to the specified files in the output directory.",
