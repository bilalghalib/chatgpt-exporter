Today is all about getting to know each other, understanding the program, and setting the foundations for the next two weeks as you learn more about the market and your customers needs!\n1\n\n\n\nLET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER\u000b\n Name?\n Where you are from?\n Tell us your idea.\n What’s your superpower?\n10 minutes: Share\n\nIntroductions:\nBefore we get started, I would like to introduce myself and get to know all of you a bit better. Let's quickly go around the room and share:\nYour name,\nWhere you are from,\nTell us a little bit about your idea. \nAnd finally, if you had a superpower, what would it be (flying, reading minds, shape shifting, etc…)?\n\nThe trainers should start first. Then, go around the room so each person can introduce themselves.\n2\n\n09:00 am \t\tWelcome + Introductions!\n09:30 am\t\tFive One Labs & Ignite\n10:30 am\t\tDesign Sprint \n12:00 pm\t\tGroup Lunch\n01:30 pm\t\tUser Research \n04:30 pm\t\tWrap up\nAGENDA\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nAgenda: Now that we all know each other a little better, let’s get into the agenda for the day. \nThis morning we will spend some time understanding Five One Labs, the program, and what exactly you will be doing over the two weeks. This will be an opportunity to clarify any questions you still have and give you some insights on what is in store ahead through a design sprint!\nGroup Lunch: At 12:00 we will take a break and get lunch together. \nThis afternoon we will come back and get into user research. This is the first major session we will have. Here we will define our research plan for the next few weeks! Tell us a little bit about your idea, what problem does it solve? Finally, we will wrap up around 4:30!\n\n3\n\nYES, AND….\n15 minutes: Icebreaker \n\n2 minutes: Explain the activity\nTrainers should conduct the “YES, AND…” Icebreaker\nMake teams of about 3-5\nState a problem or ask the group for a problem \nFor example:\nIt’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nIt is so hot outside, how can I get to and from work without sweating or ever feeling the heat?\n \n5 minutes: “No” technique:\nYou have 2 minutes to generate different crazy ideas to solve that problem. Generate as many as possible. But there is a rule! When one member in the team says an idea another one must say “no!” and come up with a completely different idea. This goes on and on until the 2 minutes are up. You have to do this quickly, let's see how many crazy ideas we will get.\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nUse an umbrella!\nNo! Build a tunnel to go directly inside!\nNo! make a waterproof suit that covers your whole body!\nNo! Build an overpass that my taxi/bus will drop me off under!\nNo! Have a drone float above my head to prevent water from touching me.\nNo!.....\n[2 minutes pass] Time is done!\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with.\n \n5 minutes: Now let’s try “yes and”: \nYou have 2 minutes again, and this time someone says an idea, and then someone else in the group must say “yes”, and add a feature to grow the idea to make the idea bigger. Is it clear? Let's do it\nFor example: It’s a rainy day and I want to get into five one labs without getting wet, how can I do that?\nBuild a tunnel to go directly inside from where you get dropped off!\nYes! And have heat inside to keep you warm on cold days\nYes! And the heat system is controlled by an app on your phone that you can use to control the temperature where you are walking\nYes! And …..\nAsk them about the different crazy ideas they came up with\n\n3 minutes: Review + recap\nAsk them which one did they like and why? (yes and or no method)\nThen explain “yes and” is good because it’s positive, and it feels good when your friends agree with your idea, right? And you can build on top of it to create really good and complete ideas. You can go deeper and come up with things that you normally wouldn’t have discovered.\n“No” is also good, as it generates a wide variety of ideas. And in real life when you talk about your idea to someone not everybody is positive and will like your idea. Sometimes you have to say no!\n\nRecap: As a rule at Five One Labs, we try to use the “yes and” method. We want to build off and support each other.\n\n4\n\nDesign Sprint!\n1 minutes: Lecture\n\nOk great! I hope you had some fun and got to know the people sitting around you a little bit more. \nWe are now going to get into the first design thinking session of Ignite, the Design Sprint! We’ll think about creative solutions that are not just effective but also mindful of resources. But first, we will give you a little introduction to the Design curriculum and an overview of the design thinking methodology.\n5\n\n\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      Introduction to Design Thinking\nFeb. 2, 2020:\t\t      User Research\nFeb. 16, 2020:\t      Define the Problem\nFeb. 20, 2020:\t\tCreativity and Ideation\n \n \n\nDESIGN THINKING SCHEDULE\nApril 1\nIntro to design thinking\nApril 1\nApril 7\nApril 8\nUser research\nDefine the problem\nCreativity and ideation\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nQuickly give an overview of the 4 Design sessions they will have over the next two weeks. \nIntroduction to Design Thinking: We will focus on giving you a good understanding of design thinking and the human centered design process today through a design sprint. Starting this afternoon, we will talk about applying the Design Thinking methodology to your business.\nUser Research: We will go into creating a research plan for you to deeply understand your customers and their needs.\nReframe: Define the Problem: We will take all of our research, and clearly define the problem for your different customer types.\nCreativity and Ideation: Finally, we will generate solutions to your customers problems. Some of them might be your current ideas, but we hope to generate a wide variety of ideas that could all be potential solutions. \n6\n\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What is design thinking?

(gather responses and write them on the board separating verbs and nouns without telling the group you are doing so)\nPotential answers (nouns):\nShe needs a book\nA ladder\nA taller chair\nShoes\nHer parents\nEtc… \n\nPotential answers (verbs)\nBe independent\nGain knowledge\nLearn information\nTo explore\nEtc…\n\n5 minutes: Recap \nIf you define needs as nouns, then there are only so many ways you can solve the problem – For example, instead of saying ‘we need more electricity,’ you could say ‘we need to reduce energy waste,’ which opens up more creative possibilities.\nIf you describe the need as a verb, you give yourself exponentially more options – For example, if you say “she needs to learn”, there are so many ways you can do this and you allow for countless possibilities:\nGet a teacher\nUse a book\nUse an online learning app\nWatch a video online\nPractice something\nEtc… \nDuring the activity, we’ll ask you to keep this in mind as you’re getting to know your partner\n9\n\nDefine a clear problem\nBuild your product\nFind the best ideas\nTest and improve\nUndertsand your customers\nDESIGN THINKING: A NON-LINEAR PROCESS\nTEST\nPROTOTYPE\nIDEATE\nDEFINE\nEMPATHIZE\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOver the course of this program, you will experience the Design Thinking process and apply it to your businesses. \nThe first step is to empathize with your user. Put yourself in their shoes and explore how they are experiencing the problem that your business idea is solving. Speak to customers and listen to their stories. \nAfter we explore our customers experiences, challenges, and high points, we will reframe that information and define the problem. What is the core challenge that our customers are facing?\nOnce we have a clearly stated problem statement, we go into ideation. What are all the possible solutions for that customer’s problem? We want a wide variety of potential solutions. Don’t be stuck in your idea!\nNext, we take a few of these ideas, build them, and test it out! By prototyping and testing frequently, we are able to save time and money while developing a product that the customers really want!\n\nThat is the design thinking process. It appears linear, and in some ways it can be. However, keep in mind that it is not intended to be a one way process. You can go back and forth on this depending on your needs.  \nAsk: Can someone give me an example of how this might not be a linear process? How might someone using the design thinking methodology move around in a way that is out of order?\nPotential answers:\nMaybe you are trying to define a clear problem, but you realize you did not gather enough information, go back and get more! Talk to more people\nMaybe you finished testing your prototype, you are going to want to bring it back to the customers and listen to how they are experiencing the product. You will continuously go through the process several times. \n\nTransition: Design is all about being experiential, so let’s get started!\n\n\nLET’S GO!\n< 1 minute: Lecture\n\nNow we are going to do a design sprint and go through the whole Design Thinking process in just 1 hour!\n11\n\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nFrame the activity and put the entrepreneurs in a situation.\nSo let me start by giving you a problem. I face this problem every day and I’m sure many of you face it as well. \n\nProblem: Every morning I wake up exhausted. I dread getting out of my warm bed to go to work in the morning. \n\nMy challenge for all of you is to redesign the morning routine to solve this problem (even if you like the morning, redesign it to make it even better).  There is one caveat here, you are not redesigning the morning routine for yourself, you are designing it for your partner. \n\nEveryone should now get into pairs. \n\n\n12\n\nINTERVIEW\n8 minutes: Activity\n\n4 minutes each: Interview Part 1\nLearn as much as you can about the other person’s morning routine\nWhat was their favorite part? What could be improved? \n\n13\n\nDIG DEEPER\n6 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes each: Dig Deeper\nTime to dig deeper – go for emotion\nAsk why 5 times\nWhat’s the underlying reason they do things? \n\n14\n\nDEFINE\n5 minutes: Activity\n\n3 minutes: Capture Findings (alone)\nDefine needs as verbs \nPinpoint surprising insights, that you’ll keep in mind as you’re developing a solution\n\n2 minutes: Reframe (alone)\nWrite the challenge you are going to address vis a vis your partner\nWrite out your point of view: “my partner needs to do get to work on time, keeping in mind that she has three kids that she needs to feed and get to school on time as well”\n\n15\n\nBRAINSTORM\n13 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm (alone)\nCome up with at least 5 creative ways to solve this problem\nDraw, sketch, or write out what you think these solutions would look like\nMake sure they’re all very different from each other\nPush yourself to think outside the box. \nUse creative constraints to help your imagination. What it it had to be a physical object, what it it had to be made from recycled materials, what it if had to be made entirely with local materials?\nGo for volume – generate as many ideas as you can (if you have more than five, write them down anyway)\n\n4 minutes each: Share ideas with your partner\n16\n\nBUILD\n8 minutes: Activity\n\nBuild a prototype!!

      "content": "Below is an analysis of the module content with a focus on (1) the overall learning objectives and flow of activities, (2) the existing references to efficiency, sustainability, and/or risk management, and (3) opportunities to integrate climate resilience and sustainability more intentionally.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Summary of the Module’s Objectives and Activities**\n\n**Module Purpose and Flow**  \n- **Goal**: Provide participants with a foundational understanding of design thinking and human-centered problem-solving, gearing them up for two weeks of exploration and validation of their entrepreneurial ideas.  \n- **Context**: This is an introductory session for a 2-week entrepreneurship program called “Ignite,” run by Five One Labs. Participants will get to know each other, learn key design thinking methods, and begin the process of researching users and defining the problems they aim to solve.\n\n**Key Activities**  \n1. **Welcome & Introductions**  \n   - Participants introduce themselves, their ideas, and a fun “superpower” icebreaker.  \n   - The day’s agenda is outlined: an overview of Five One Labs, a short design sprint, a group lunch, user research session, and wrap-up.\n\n2. **Icebreaker: “Yes, and … / No!”**  \n   - Teams generate solutions to a small problem (e.g., staying dry on a rainy day) under two different constraints:  \n     - “No!” encourages quickly pivoting to unrelated, creative ideas.  \n     - “Yes, and…” builds on each idea collaboratively.  \n   - **Purpose**: Demonstrate the value of open-mindedness and collaboration, while also showing that even negative feedback (“No!”) can generate creative breadth.\n\n3. **Design Thinking Overview**  \n   - Four key sessions over two weeks are introduced:  \n     1. Introduction to design thinking  \n     2. User research  \n     3. Define the problem  \n     4. Creativity and ideation  \n   - Participants learn the general flow of empathize → define → ideate → prototype → test, emphasizing that the process is iterative, not strictly linear.\n\n4. **Design Sprint** (in one hour)  \n   - **Framing**: Participants redesign the morning routine for a partner (not for themselves).  \n   - **Steps**:  \n     1. **Interview (8 minutes)**: Understand the partner’s routine, challenges, and emotional drivers.  \n     2. **Dig Deeper (6 minutes)**: Uncover root causes and motivations.  \n     3. **Define (5 minutes)**: Translate findings into clear needs and a succinct problem statement (focusing on verbs vs. nouns).  \n     4. **Brainstorm (13 minutes)**: Generate a wide range of possible solutions, encourage “out-of-the-box” thinking.  \n     5. **Build (8 minutes)**: Create a quick prototype using accessible materials.  \n     6. **Feedback (20 minutes)**: Test the prototype with the partner, gather feedback, iterate, and reflect.  \n\n5. **Wrap-Up**  \n   - Summarizes how the participants went through the entire design thinking process in under an hour.  \n   - Sets the stage for deeper application throughout the two-week program and the subsequent incubator phase.\n\n**Learning Objectives**  \n- **Introduce design thinking** and human-centered design as core frameworks for entrepreneurship.  \n- Practice **collaborative ideation** and creative problem-solving (“Yes, and…”).  \n- Gain **user insights** through targeted interviews and empathizing with the user’s lived experiences.  \n- Understand the **iterative nature** of design (empathize/define/ideate/prototype/test).  \n- Build early **prototypes** and learn the value of rapid feedback loops.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Existing References to Efficiency, Sustainability, or Risk Management**\n\nWhile this initial session is primarily focused on teaching the fundamentals of design thinking, there are **hints** of sustainability and resource awareness in the following places:\n\n1. **“Use creative constraints…”**  \n   - The brainstorming section encourages participants to consider designing solutions from recycled materials or limiting resources. This introduces a basic sustainability lens into the ideation process.\n\n2. **“Offer a diverse range of materials…”**  \n   - During the prototype-building stage, participants are encouraged to use local, recycled, and green materials where possible. This suggests an existing nod toward resource efficiency and environmental awareness.\n\n3. **Reflection Questions**  \n   - “Could your solution work with fewer resources or less waste?” This question explicitly invites participants to think about resource constraints and possibly the environmental impact of their designs.\n\n4. **Risk Management or Efficiency**  \n   - While not explicit, the question “What mistakes are people making when interacting with your prototype?” encourages participants to consider potential failures or risks in the design. This is an indirect introduction to risk management from the user-experience perspective.\n\nAt this point, **climate resilience** per se has not been directly addressed, but the seeds of sustainability are introduced in the prototyping constraints.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Where to Integrate Climate Resilience and Sustainability More Intentionally**\n\nSince the module already touches on using recycled materials and asking about resource use, there are multiple natural points to weave in climate resilience and sustainability:\n\n1. **Contextualizing the Problem Statements**  \n   - In the design thinking activities, you could introduce an example problem (or encourage participants to do so) that ties to climate resilience—e.g., “How might we help local businesses or households reduce energy or water usage?” or “How might we mitigate the impact of extreme weather on daily commutes?” This way, the interviews and ideation focus more explicitly on environmental challenges.\n\n2. **“Yes, and … / No!” Exercise**  \n   - Use climate or environmental prompts (like flooding, heat waves, or drought) as the “problem statement” in the icebreaker. For instance: “It’s extremely hot due to a heat wave—how do we keep our workspace cool and reduce energy use?” This small shift keeps the fun, creative feel of the icebreaker but introduces real-world resilience aspects.\n\n3. **Brainstorming Constraints**  \n   - Strengthen the existing green prompt. For example: “What if your solution must *reduce carbon emissions* or *use zero plastic*?” More explicit framing around climate and sustainability can help participants see the viability of greener entrepreneurial models.\n\n4. **Prototyping with Sustainability in Mind**  \n   - Provide “sustainability-inspired materials” as default for prototypes (e.g., cardboard, scrap paper, organic fabrics) and label them as such. This subtly normalizes sustainable thinking in product and service design.\n\n5. **Discussion & Debrief**  \n   - After the design sprint, pose additional reflection questions to tie climate resilience back to the final solutions:  \n     - “How does your solution handle extreme environmental conditions?”  \n     - “Could this solution help reduce waste or resource consumption in your partner’s daily routine?”  \n     - “How might local climate challenges or seasonal changes impact your idea?”  \n\n6. **User Research Session**  \n   - Incorporate climate-related questions into user research guides. For instance, if participants are working on a small agriculture-based concept, they might include questions on water scarcity, soil quality, or how climate change is affecting crop yield. This ties business viability to climate resilience.\n\nBy seamlessly integrating these elements, participants not only learn the core design thinking process but also begin to internalize the importance of **environmentally responsible entrepreneurship** and **risk mitigation** related to climate impacts.\n\n---\n\n### In Summary\n\n- **Objectives & Activities**: The module teaches design thinking basics through an engaging, hands-on design sprint.  \n- **References to Sustainability & Risk**: Found in the encouragement to use recycled materials, minimize waste, and reflect on solution pitfalls.  \n- **Integrating Climate Resilience**: Add climate-related prompts, explicitly label green materials, and include reflection questions that help participants factor in climate impacts and resource constraints from the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey.\n\nBy making these small yet pointed adjustments, the curriculum can better prepare participants to build ventures that are not only user-centric but also climate-resilient and sustainable.",
