It proves the humanity in technology. \n\nBloom.pm is a non-profit educational institute that builds technology, operates boot camps and accelerators, and works with universities in SWANA. We're based in Beirut, so we don't have a 501c3, although we're a registered charity. We also are not a .edu, although we work closely with Universities. Our focus is on whole human development through project-based learning (alternative university). \n\nI would love the discount for our team; please let me know if you have questions. You can call me on WA/Signal: +14782272253\n\nWorkshop Proposal for 37Signals:\nDiscover what you need to learn even when it lives in your blind spots. Bloom helps our students do that with mentorship. However, with LLMs having essentially a \"map of knowledge,\" we are developing a prompting technique that allows people to \"Learn What They Don't Yet Know They Need To Learn.\" \n\nAs the Education Researcher at Bloom, I've been playing with LLMs and contemplating how they work and how best to take advantage of their mechanism of operation. It became clear we could take our students' profiles and learning goals and create 2 embeddings (a location in space*) that capture the semantic meaning. Having these two \"locations\" means we can support creating pathways while also helping refine the destination embedding, supporting meaning in goal setting. This is how we can continue to support Bloom's mission of unlocking human potential through transformative educational experiences. \n\nI'd love to share this framework with you, and 37signals at large, in a workshop. If you are interested, please forward this email to the responsible party. It might be a way to most truly demonstrate our commitment to education ;D\n\n* very multi-dimensional\n\nFind 5 pros and 5 cons and then give a summary of your findings",

      "content": "Here’s a review of your email requesting a discount and proposing a workshop to Basecamp from 37signals:\n\n### Pros:\n1. **Personalized and Complimentary Opening**: Starting with compliments about 37signals' leadership in UX and copy sets a positive tone and personalizes the message, making it more engaging.\n\n2. **Clear Introduction of Bloom.pm**: You effectively introduce Bloom.pm, summarizing its mission and the work it does. This provides the reader with a quick understanding of your organization and its relevance.\n\n3. **Explanation of Non-Profit Status**: You clearly state your non-profit status and explain the absence of a 501c3 and .edu domain, which is crucial for setting the context for a discount request.\n\n4. **Innovative Workshop Proposal**: The workshop proposal is intriguing and aligns with the technological and educational ethos of 37signals, potentially offering value to both organizations.\n\n5. **Call to Action**: You provide a direct way to contact you and a call to action, inviting them to forward the email to the appropriate party, which is essential for driving engagement.\n\n### Cons:\n1. **Ambiguous Discount Request**: The request for a discount is somewhat vague and buried in the middle of the paragraph. It would be clearer if this request was more directly stated with specifics about the type of discount you’re seeking.\n\n2. **Technical Jargon**: The workshop proposal, while innovative, uses quite a bit of technical jargon (e.g., \"embeddings\", \"semantic meaning\") that might not be immediately clear to all readers, potentially alienating those not familiar with these terms.\n\n3. **Lacks Specifics of the Workshop**: The proposal mentions what you want to achieve with the workshop but lacks specifics about the workshop's structure, duration, or what exactly 37signals would gain from participating.\n\n4. **Assumes Interest**: The sign-off assumes interest on the part of 37signals and pushes for forwarding the email without initial consent or inquiry about interest, which might be perceived as presumptive.\n\n5. **Contact Information Protocol**: Providing a phone number for WhatsApp/Signal is practical, but it might be more professional to include an official email contact or to ask for their preferred method of communication.\n\n### Summary:\nYour email effectively conveys enthusiasm and aligns Bloom.pm’s goals with the interests of 37signals, particularly in the fields of technology and education. However, the message could benefit from clearer requests and definitions, both for the discount and the workshop details. Additionally, it might be more effective to initially gauge interest with a less direct approach before suggesting the email be forwarded. Consider refining the technical descriptions to be more accessible and adding a more formal closing with different contact options to enhance professionalism.",
