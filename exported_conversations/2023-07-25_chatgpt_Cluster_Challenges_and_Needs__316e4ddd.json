These include:\nLack of innovative and creative ideas in the Argytech and Cleantech sectors\nMisconceptions about technology\nDifficulty in finding the right startups to join our programs (Same startups everywhere) \nFunding constraints\nMeasuring the impact of our programs\"\t\"Our current priorities for wellbeing and engagement in the workplace include:\nMeaningful and positive work environment: Our organization values an open and collaborative work culture where everyone can contribute ideas and suggestions, regardless of hierarchy. We believe that this creates a positive work environment where everyone feels valued and engaged.\nAvailability of opportunities for growth and development: We prioritize offering training, mentorship, and career advancement opportunities to all staff members whenever it is needed. This allows our team to feel invested in their work and continuously improve their skills and knowledge.\nFeedback and communication: We prioritize open communication and feedback channels to allow for continuous improvement and growth. This helps us to foster a culture of continuous learning and development, and allows all staff members to feel heard and valued.\nBy prioritizing these areas, we believe that our team feels more engaged and valued in their work, and is able to contribute to the overall success of the organization\n\nPersonal: \nwork-life balance, exercise, mental health activities, and practicing self-care.\"\t\"The three activities that nurture me the most are:\nMeditation and mindfulness practices, especially in nature: Practicing mindfulness and meditation in a natural setting helps me feel at peace and connected to the world around me.\nExercise and physical activity: Engaging in regular physical activity helps me feel energized, boosts my mood, and improves my overall physical health.\nSpending time in nature: Being surrounded by nature helps me feel grounded and relaxed.

Poverty rates have been increasing exponentially in such highly populated areas and farmers and local producers have been suffering from high cost of inputs and limited sales due to transportation costs and limited consumer capacity.\nNature by Marc Beyrouthy since its establishment 7 years ago has been committed to helping the rural communities. During this time, NoGarlicNoOnions NGNO, with Anthony Rahayel, founder of Souk El Akel have been promoting Lebanese food and its culture. Together we organized MenKelLebnenLaKelLebnen to support MenKelLebnen initiative for Lebanon & Lebanese producers. This initiative buys vegetables, fruits, and Mouneh from remote areas, making sure to distribute them to families in need, hopefully on all the Lebanese territory.\nIn the beginning of 2020, Nature by Marc Beyrouthy and NGNO joined efforts in “La Campagne en Ville”, producer’s market which took place each month. The aim was to support the local producers, women cooperatives, and small artisans, by providing marketing support. \n\nwe believe that “ALONE, WE CAN DO SO LITTLE;TOGETHER, WE CAN DO SO MUCH”\"\t\"we are trying to create a safe and healthy atmosphere in which all members of the community can participate;as gathering places where families can bond with neighbors and visit with friends. \nA place where producers contribute to local food security and diversity. Creating a full support between local population and the producers. This place can also provide a medium by which people can get closer to their food sources. Many consumers feel good about supporting local producers. They also tend to distinguish the food offered at farmer’s markets as higher in quality, more flavorful, fresher, and healthier than the produce typically found in other outlets. \nWe are also a space for exchange of ideas, workshops and sessions. Not to mention, how many national and international conferences and meetings are choosing this place of positivity to nurture their groups while they also access the products and the community.\"\tTeam building activities, learning experience, markets or festive gatherings have the perfect location within our hub. Our assets include experts in different fields are ready to support and assist the growth and blooming of our community. We also have a team of dedicated people committed to supporting small producers from local rural and surrounding communities while aiming to achieve an enhanced and sustainable livelihood. Our team includes social media, organization, customer service, etc.\t.\t2023-06-15 8:50:38 AM\nPark Innovation\tDana\tAbou Shackra\tdana@park-innovation.com\twww.park-innovation.com\t\"Agriculture, General / Other\t, Food & Beverage\t, Technology, General / Other\"\tLebanon\tThinking BIG\tHealth and time management\tExercise and mental agility training\tYes, we can incorporate wellbeing programs into the training schedule.\t2023-06-19 4:34:16 PM\nSikka Saida\tMohammed\tGhamloush\tmdghamloush@gmail.com\thttps://sikkasaida.org\t\"Agriculture, General / Other\t, Education, General / Other\t, Food & Beverage\t, Nonprofit Organization Management, Renewables & Environment, Technology, General / Other\"\tLebanon\tResources(money, experts, reach, materials)\t\"The current situation in Lebanon has become very depressing to the people living in the area.\nOur main focus is to help these people heal so they can work on their dreams so they can thrive in their own environment.\"\t\"Personal development\nNLP Coaching\nPhysical activities like Yoga, meditation, music therapy..etc\nWe also have an orchard and use it to help people to get back the connection to the land.

Poverty rates have been increasing exponentially in such highly populated areas and farmers and local producers have been suffering from high cost of inputs and limited sales due to transportation costs and limited consumer capacity.\nNature by Marc Beyrouthy since its establishment 7 years ago has been committed to helping the rural communities. During this time, NoGarlicNoOnions NGNO, with Anthony Rahayel, founder of Souk El Akel have been promoting Lebanese food and its culture. Together we organized MenKelLebnenLaKelLebnen to support MenKelLebnen initiative for Lebanon & Lebanese producers. This initiative buys vegetables, fruits, and Mouneh from remote areas, making sure to distribute them to families in need, hopefully on all the Lebanese territory.\nIn the beginning of 2020, Nature by Marc Beyrouthy and NGNO joined efforts in “La Campagne en Ville”, producer’s market which took place each month. The aim was to support the local producers, women cooperatives, and small artisans, by providing marketing support. \nMade by Nature is offering an opportunity for the producers by providing visibility: promotional videos are made during our visits to the producers, as well as interviews during the fairs. These videos are posted on YouTube and eventually television to promote the companies and their products. This is helping the producer market their product and show transparency to enhance trust in client-producer relations. \n\nwe believe that “ALONE, WE CAN DO SO LITTLE;TOGETHER, WE CAN DO SO MUCH”\"\t\"we are trying to create a safe and healthy atmosphere in which all members of the community can participate;as gathering places where families can bond with neighbors and visit with friends. \nA place where producers contribute to local food security and diversity. Creating a full support between local population and the producers. This place can also provide a medium by which people can get closer to their food sources. Many consumers feel good about supporting local producers. They also tend to distinguish the food offered at farmer’s markets as higher in quality, more flavorful, fresher, and healthier than the produce typically found in other outlets. \nWe are also a space for exchange of ideas, workshops and sessions. Not to mention, how many national and international conferences and meetings are choosing this place of positivity to nurture their groups while they also access the products and the community.\"\tTeam building activities, learning experience, markets or festive gatherings have the perfect location within our hub. Our assets include experts in different fields are ready to support and assist the growth and blooming of our community. We also have a team of dedicated people committed to supporting small producers from local rural and surrounding communities while aiming to achieve an enhanced and sustainable livelihood.
