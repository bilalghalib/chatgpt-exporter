      "content": "In the Maliki Fiqh, is it possible to pray a different prayer with a different intention behind the Imam in Taraweeh if I need to make up my prayers? And I'm not supposed to pray any Sunnah prayers before catching up on my previous prayers, right? So how can I do Taraweeh and join the crowd given the Maliki Fiqh interpretation? I would like to go and maybe pray between people and then make my prayer of make up Fajr prayer for every two Ruqa and I'll just make, you know, four different Fajr prayers with each of their two. Does that make sense?",

      "content": "Yes, in the Maliki school of thought, it is generally valid to pray a different obligatory prayer behind an imam who is leading another prayer, as long as the structure aligns (i.e., the number of rak‘āt and the general order of movements). However, there are specific considerations when it comes to joining the congregation for Tarawīḥ while making up missed prayers (Qaḍā’).\n\n### Key Considerations in Maliki Fiqh:\n\n1. **Praying an Obligatory (Qaḍā’) Prayer Behind a Voluntary Prayer**  \n   - In the Maliki madhhab, it is generally not valid to pray an obligatory prayer (Qaḍā’) behind an imam who is leading a Sunnah or Nafl prayer (such as Tarawīḥ). This is because an obligatory prayer is of a higher status than a voluntary one, and the imam’s intention must generally be equal to or greater than that of the follower.\n\n2. **Priority of Making Up Missed Prayers**  \n   - In Maliki Fiqh, making up missed prayers takes precedence over voluntary prayers. This means that if you have missed prayers to make up, you are technically not supposed to engage in Sunnah prayers like Tarawīḥ until you have fulfilled your Qaḍā’ prayers. \n\n3. **How to Join the Congregation While Making Up Missed Prayers?**\n   - One option is to **pray your missed Fajr prayers separately while standing among the congregation**, following their movements but maintaining your own intention and recitations. Since Fajr is two rak‘āt and Tarawīḥ is prayed in units of two, this can work logistically.\n   - However, because you are performing an **obligatory prayer** while the imam is leading a **voluntary** one, this is problematic in the Maliki school. \n\n### Alternative Approach:\nSince you want to be part of the community experience while also fulfilling your Qaḍā’ obligations, you could consider:\n\n1. **Praying Alone or in a Small Group for Qaḍā’**  \n   - You can attend the mosque for Tarawīḥ, but instead of following the imam, find a space where you can pray your missed Fajr prayers in sets of two rak‘āt.\n   - If possible, you can find someone else who also has Qaḍā’ prayers to make up and pray together.\n\n2. **Praying Tarawīḥ After a Dedicated Time for Qaḍā’**  \n   - Some scholars allow a practical balance: dedicating a portion of the night to making up missed prayers, and then praying some units of Tarawīḥ afterward if you have energy.\n\n### Conclusion:\nYour approach of making up multiple Fajr prayers (each two rak‘āt) within the congregation praying Tarawīḥ is not technically valid in Maliki Fiqh because an obligatory prayer cannot be performed behind an imam leading a voluntary one. Instead, you should prioritize making up missed prayers separately, either before or during the Tarawīḥ gathering, but not as part of the Tarawīḥ congregation. \n\nWould you like suggestions on structuring your Qaḍā’ prayers in a way that still allows you to enjoy the Tarawīḥ experience?",

      "content": "In Maliki fiqh, praying your own prayer in a congregation setting—without following the imam—can be permissible if done in a way that does not confuse others or disrupt the order of the congregation. Here’s how to approach it:\n\n### **Praying in the Row Without Following the Imam**\n- If you stand **in the row with others** but are praying your own Qaḍā’ prayer, **it can be confusing for those next to you**, as they might assume you are following the imam.\n- To minimize confusion, you could stand **at the edge of the row** or **near a pillar** to ensure you don’t disrupt the unity of the congregation.\n- Since you are not following the imam, your bowing and prostrations may not align perfectly with the congregation’s, which could cause some distraction.\n\n### **Alternative Approaches to Preserve the Congregational Atmosphere**\n1. **Praying by a Pillar or a Side Area**  \n   - Many mosques have **pillars or designated spaces** where people pray individually.  \n   - If possible, find a **discreet corner** to pray without breaking the congregation’s rows.\n\n2. **Timing Your Movements to Match the Congregation (Without Following the Imam)**  \n   - While it is not obligatory, some scholars suggest that when praying alone near a congregation, **timing your movements similarly to those praying Tarawīḥ** can prevent confusion and maintain unity.\n   - This does **not** mean following the imam’s intention—your prayer is independent—but it prevents major visible discrepancies in movement.\n\n3. **Praying at the Back of the Congregation**  \n   - If the mosque is large, you might consider standing **at the back** rather than in the middle of the rows.\n   - Some mosques have spaces for those completing missed prayers or praying alone.\n\n4. **Joining the Congregation for Tarawīḥ After Some Qaḍā’**  \n   - If your goal is both **social participation and fulfilling obligations**, you could:\n     - Pray some of your Qaḍā’ prayers first, then pray some Tarawīḥ with the congregation afterward.\n     - Since Tarawīḥ is a Sunnah prayer, you are not required to complete all 20 rak‘āt.\n\n### **Conclusion: What’s Best?**\n- **Praying in the row while doing a different prayer is not ideal** in Maliki fiqh due to potential confusion.\n- **Best approach:** Pray **near a pillar, at the side, or at the back** while maintaining the general rhythm of movements to minimize disruption.\n- **Alternative:** Do part of your Qaḍā’ before Tarawīḥ and then join the congregation for some rak‘āt to still be part of the communal worship.\n\nWould you like help structuring a plan to balance your Qaḍā’ with attending Tarawīḥ?",
