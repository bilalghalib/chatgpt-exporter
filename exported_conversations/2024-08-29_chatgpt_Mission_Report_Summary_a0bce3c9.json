      "content": "can you help me take this messy running transcript of my trip to Mosul and turn it into an organized and well structured mission report? My mission was as follows:\nBuilding Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project \n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE \n\n \n\nName of the mission: Stakeholder Mapping Meetup \n\nMission from: Erbil to: Mosul 19 to 22.08.2024 \n\n \n\nBackground  \n\nThe International Trade Centre (ITC) is a joint agency of the United Nations and the World Trade \n\nOrganization, focusing in particular on developing the export capabilities of small and medium-sized businesses in developing and transition economies. ITC is 100% \"Aid for Trade\", supporting trade that delivers inclusive and sustainable development results. ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and transition economies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs) Fragile States and Sub-Saharan Africa. To support a more inclusive distribution of development gains, ITC works with women, youth, and marginalized groups in developing countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that provide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation. \n\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq, implemented by UN-Habitat, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent work and affordable housing. This multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive investment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq's National Public Works Programme, enhancing capacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting trade-led private sector engagement in climatesmart construction, and empowering social partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these components, BEIT focuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools and legislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social dialogue and capacity building among social partners, all to address housing challenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating climate change impacts in the housing sector. \n\n \n\nMain objectives: \n\nThis mission corresponds to the following Outputs and Activities under Bilal’s Terms of Reference. \n\nOutput 1. Comprehensive Training Curriculum Package \n\nActivity 1.1 Site visits to local stakeholders, universities, businesses, nonprofits and training organizations to identify and map relevant stakeholders and the available skills and competencies within the ecosystem in Nineva. \n\nOutput 2.

Through these sessions we can identify stakeholder engagement, competency, and skills opening doors for future focus groups and expert consultations.  \n\nMission agenda: \n\nThe development of the agenda below is in progress and some last-minute changes might occur. The sequencing of these meeting may change owing to logistical considerations. \n\nDATE TIME (Iraq time, CET +1h) \n\nACTIVITY \n\nNOTES \n\nOVERNIGHT \n\nSunday 18 August 2024  \n\nMeetings in Erbil KESK, GROFIN, 51 LABS and others  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMonday 19 August 2024 \n\n \n\nBilal travels to Mosul by Taxi \n\nSite visits and expert consultations with stakeholders in Mosul \n\n \n\n \n\nYes \n\nTuesday 20th of August 2024 \n\nSite visits and expert consultations with stakeholders in Mosul \n\n \n\nYes \n\nWednesday 21 August 2024 \n\n \n\n \n\nMosul \n\n10.30-14.00  \nSustainable Reconstruction Meetup / Focus Group \nWelcoming a broad spectrum of stakeholders in Mosul to a session sharing insights, best practices, and activities.  \n\n \n\n \n\nYes \n\nThursday 22 August 2024 \n\n \n\nSite visits and expert consultations with stakeholders in Mosul \n\n \n\nBack to Erbil by end of the Day \n\n \n\n \n\nNo \n\n \n\n \n\nThis is my writeup:I need to write a mission report of my time in Iraq - you can see some of my insights in curriculumprojectinsightsfrommissiontomosuliraq.pdf and you can see an example of a mission report in the FGDs report document. \n\nSo my trip started with an interview with rawanga organization and we interviewed them as a potential training partner and then we also interviewed 51 labs as a potential training partner on the 18th. Both of these organizations are in Erbil and their interviews are being processed for the selection report for the trainer. Next, we met up with Abdullah from Mosul Space and learned about the organization and developed our outreach attempts, Abdullah encourages User Generated Content for the awareness campaign moment. and then in the evening, we went to the mosul Heritage foundation founded by ayub thinuun and were able to connect with the local heritage and historic buildings that exemplify the sustainability practices of its history and we concluded our evening meeting up with Saleh from the WFP and Abdullraouf from the university of mosul as a student, we then visited Visions of Baghdad in the old city where we had a chance to connect with local nonprofits and learn a lot about the history of mosul and how young people experienced the occupation and learned some very valuable insights about the energy of volunteerism and cooperation that emerged soon after the occupation was lifted. We also continued to visit with the Mosque of Nuri, the \"lighthouse\" of mosul destroyed during the occupation and got a chance to see some of the buildings that were damaged during the war. The next day we went to qaf where we had a full day interviewing QAF labs and learning from Mariam Abdullah and SHAALAN who is the lead tech person at qaf labs. qaf labs can be a valuable partner due to their ability to produce content, their professionalism and their ability to have a large social media reach, particularly for the awareness campaign. They may also be good post hackathon incubators for projects that emerge from that hackathon another important thing and lesson that we were realizing during this process is that the paid trainings and the nonprofit model of a lot of these spaces makes sustainability difficult when priorities change and this makes me want to connect more with hybrid models like golf as well as inspire me to encourage nonpaid trainings and cross sector collaborations for the trainings rather than working only with one training organization. In the evening I met up with local architects and civil engineers who shared valuable insights about the importance of learning from the past, yet not being fixated on building things exactly like they did 1000 years ago. Each of them was grateful and able to identify training programs that helped them advance their careers, in particular programs from Italy around heritage and construction. \n\nLater that same evening I was able to meet with Abdulsattar the regional municipality lead and hear about the encouragements of building a local hub of hubs to house local nonprofits, reduce their expenses and act as a catalyst for innovative organizations in mostly and it was very promising then I also had a chance to visit with  AYMEN from the ministry of educational general director at vocational education and was glad to see their willingness to have a conversation, although practical collaborations were not forthcoming. They referred me to MOLSA for further Discussions then I had a meeting with the university of mosul and Dr. Bassem and Dr. Abdullah from the departments of environment and architecture and sustainability, and had a discussion about the importance of heritage water and the impact the war had on mindsets in mostly as well as the long history of Muslim's experience with famine, and how when they were being blocked, their focus on self-sufficiency has developed into a deep part of its culture and thinking about how can we use that history of self-sufficiency to connect with sustainability as a meta theme the idea of connecting with her heritage and history to show that sustainability is a local phenomenon not something coming from outside then I had a chance to meet up with Ihab from RIAYDAH and learn about their training programs. They are a potential partner, particularly for mindset and soft skills and they have a venue and mostly as well as have been a part of many of the founders of organizations, including the Mosul  heritage foundation ayub thinuun and their emphasis on contribution and volunteerism and mindset can be a valuable addition to our training. Later that evening met with local Youth, who work in the HVAC systems installing air conditioners and got a chance to learn that they don't find training available for solar skills, solar panel installing skills and also they have doubts about whether or not solar is inappropriate solution due to its cost for houses in Mosul and then we had a wonderful day with over 20 participants from government sectors business trainers people in university as well as Youth come to space and shared with us their insights around what a well developed training for sustainable reconstruction. Could look like some of those insights can be found below a highlight of the presentation for me was Dr. Bassem describing the green Zugaro rating system and how this system would be a locally relevant certification system for greenhouses coming from the university of Muslim. We also heard about a wonderful initiative called climate space being held in space that can be a regular event that can act as a pulse to activate a community around sustainability, reconstruction and outreach after that, I went to visit the festival of private and governmental education, which was held in the forests of MOSUL and was inspired to see such a diverse array of educators and trainers celebrating and mostly in such a beautiful green space as soon as you walk in the temperature drops 10° some of the most inspiring things I saw there were young people at the GSS of  neinavah madrasat al mawhibeen and seeing their many sustainability projects coming from kids as young as 10 years old working on solar panels that run water, purifiers and energy harvesting tools as well as smart temperature control systems for the home. Finally, I had a chance to visit the Beit project and was able to see their heritage museum and find deep historic practices of recycling and sustainability. One practice is the usage of ceramic and clay pots that are damaged during the firing process and instead of destroying them and throwing them away, they would use these deformed clay pots to fill the interstitial spaces between a dome and the top of a building to act as an air gap for insulation. It is these and many other historic, cultural trends, both physical like these pots and non-physical like the maslawwis interest in self-sufficiency and supporting their neighbors that give me hope that we will be able to connect with this deep thread of the past to support people and seeing this heritage as the foundation of a beautiful and sustainable future.\n\nAsk me 5 questions to help you guide the writing, also please use my language and style as much as possible. Do not write too much from yourself, ask me questions and i'll answer them and use my writing to flesh out the mission report\n\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTo help guide the writing of your mission report, here are five questions that will help me structure your information effectively while keeping your language and style:\n\nPrioritization of Insights: Which insights or observations from your trip do you consider most crucial to highlight in the mission report? Are there any specific organizations, individuals, or events you feel should take precedence in the narrative?\n\nStructure of the Report: Would you prefer the report to follow a chronological order, detailing each day's events as they happened, or should it be organized thematically, grouping insights by topics such as \"Potential Training Partners,\" \"Cultural Heritage,\" and \"Sustainability Practices\"?\n\nTone and Style: How formal or informal do you want the report to be? Should it maintain a conversational tone, reflecting your personal experiences and observations, or should it be more formal and objective, focusing on factual reporting?\n\nLevel of Detail: How detailed should the report be regarding your interactions with stakeholders? Should we include specific quotes, detailed descriptions of the meetings, and the outcomes, or should we focus more on summarizing the key takeaways?\n\nFollow-up Actions: Are there any specific next steps or follow-up actions that emerged from your meetings that you want to emphasize in the report? How should these be incorporated— as a separate section at the end or woven into the narrative of each day/event?\n\nOnce you provide your answers, I'll use them to craft a structured mission report that aligns with your preferences and style.\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n1. i'd like to organize it around each interview and the main insights gathered from that interview, you can see them inline in the text above\nchronological order is good\nI'd like it to be more formal and objective\nI'd like it to be as detailed as you can get, ask me questions if you need more information to make it detailed, I have transcripts if helpful\nfollow-up actions would be sending out a summary of the sustainablity and reconstruction meetup to the participants and to follow-up with calls to various members of the participants and to aggregate the insights into a curriculum and begin the validation process and scheduling the next visit to bring people together for a validation of the curriculum session. \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGreat! Based on your preferences, I’ll organize your mission report around each interview and event, presenting the insights in chronological order with a formal and objective tone. I’ll make it as detailed as possible, and I’ll incorporate the follow-up actions you’ve mentioned. To ensure I capture everything accurately, I have a few more questions:\n\nInterview with Rawanga Organization and 51 Labs: Could you provide more details on the key insights you gathered from these interviews? Specifically, what were their strengths, weaknesses, and potential contributions to the BEIT project?\n\nMeeting with Abdullah from Mosul Space: You mentioned outreach attempts and User Generated Content for the awareness campaign. Could you elaborate on what specific outreach strategies were discussed and how User Generated Content could be integrated?\n\nInsights from the Mosul Heritage Foundation: You highlighted the connection to local heritage and sustainability practices. Can you specify any particular practices or examples that stood out and how they might influence the project?\n\nQAF Labs’ Role in the Project: You mentioned QAF Labs’ potential as post-hackathon incubators and their professionalism. Could you detail any specific projects or capabilities that make them a strong partner, and how they might be integrated into the BEIT project?\n\nSustainability and Reconstruction Meetup: Could you share more on the key insights gathered from this meetup? Specifically, any standout ideas or feedback on the training programs that should be emphasized in the report?\n\nWith these details, I’ll be able to craft a comprehensive and structured mission report that aligns with your needs.\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nmosul-sustainability-meeting.md\nFile\nRawanga is an organization with a large footprint, they have some experience with sustainability and have a large tree planting campaign they've just executed. They would need to hire trainers for the sustainability and reconstruction training. they seem to have processese for M&E well established and are organized. they also have conenctions with the govronment as well as many organizations and may be a good organization to work with to connect people with internships\n51 labs is focused more on entrepreneurship training and could be great for further develpment of innovative ideas. They have a short ideation workshop that might be helpful to run with people before we take ideas into an accelerator or incubator to increase the size of the funnel of potentially innovative projects in Sustainable Reconstruction\n2. Abduallah mentioned using this process in previous work and finding it very engaging where requesting people to respond to prompts on social media to produce content and tag their organization created engagement and a large organic reach for their project. We could do something similar for our work, perhaps identifying heritage architectural practices and local \"hacks\" for sustainable practices and taking photos and sharing them on social media with a tag similar to #lookingBackLeapingForward\n3. materials used that don't absorb much heat, the shanasheel window coverings that let light in yet block direct sunlight. Having different colors with the engraved walls creating light and dark patterns that create convection currents and many more. \n4. qaf labs focuses on incubation and have the benefit of a large network and not being a non-profit, so their sustainability can be less at the whim of funders and potentially working with a business that has in its interest businesses success could be a valuable way to ensure long term sustainability of our projects\n5. the meetup had many insights, I will attach a document which includes a summary of the meetup's insights:\nIdentified Categories\nEnergy Solutions\nChallenges\nStakeholders\nJob Opportunities and Training\nCommunity Engagement\nSustainability Practices\nTechnical and Practical Considerations\nGovernment and Policy\nCategory 1: Energy Solutions\nSolar Energy: The transcript highlights the use of solar energy as a primary focus for sustainable construction.
