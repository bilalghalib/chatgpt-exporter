Here's a dish I recommend that's fast and requires minimal effort: \n\n---\n\n### **Pumpkin & Merguez Stew**\n1. **Ingredients:**\n   - Cooked pumpkin and carrots (already ready!).\n   - One merguez sausage.\n   - Onion (sliced or diced).\n   - Tomato sauce (or chopped tomatoes).\n   - Optional: Coconut milk for creaminess.\n   - Spices: Salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, or any spice mix you love.\n\n2. **Steps:**\n   1. **Sauté the sausage**: Slice the merguez into pieces or crumble it if possible. Sauté it in a pot until it releases its flavorful oils.\n   2. **Add onions**: Throw in some sliced onions and let them soften in the sausage fat.\n   3. **Stir in tomato sauce**: Add the tomato sauce (around 1-2 cups) and let it simmer for a few minutes.\n   4. **Add the pumpkin and carrots**: Toss in your cooked cubes of pumpkin and carrots, stirring gently to coat them in the sauce.\n   5. **Optional - Coconut milk**: If you want a creamy twist, add a splash of coconut milk.\n   6. **Simmer and season**: Let it all simmer for about 5-10 minutes to let the flavors meld. Adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and a dash of cumin or paprika.\n\n3. **Serve**: Enjoy it as a standalone dish, or serve it over rice, couscous, or with crusty bread to soak up the sauce.\n\n---\n\nThis dish is rich, hearty, and the merguez adds a lovely spice that complements the sweetness of the pumpkin and carrots.
