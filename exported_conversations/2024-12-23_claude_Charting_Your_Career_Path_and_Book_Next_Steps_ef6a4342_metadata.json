And maybe it's the end of the year, maybe it's the fact that crypto is zipping and I never know when to sell, because I haven't figured out how to deal with taxes, and I don't really want to sell, and I don't really want to buy, I don't want to even look at it, and I don't really want to think about money, and I need to apply for a job, and I think I have a good prospect at the due school, but I don't want to ever get a job, because I'm not the kind of person that works for other people. I always have my own projects, and I work for myself, and it would be the first time, and I'd like you to sort of come up with 10 questions, work sort of like a mix between a coach and a psychoanalyst, and help me really reflect and think about my life, and the end of the year, it's December 23rd, 2024, and I'm feeling like the whole world is sort of falling apart, this war has kind of been going on, and I just feel a little bit uneasy in all sorts of ways, and I don't really have a job right now, or work, I have a little bit of money, but who even knows what money is, I don't know if I should be buying gold or silver, or what exactly, and I'm walking with my baby, and he's cute, and yesterday was my wife's birthday, and I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm having a hard time. Can you help me think through these things, and other things, you know, like I haven't really worked on my publication for my paper, and there's all these things that I just wish I was better at, but I'm not, and I'm getting old, and I don't really have time for working out, and my family's far away, and I don't know if I'm holding my application well, and my sheikh in Gambia, my teacher, spiritual master, has told me to always have a question of God, or a positive impression of God, and I'm struggling to do that. Can you tell me what to think, can you help me think through these things, go by questions, and try to help me understand, and find a better way forward?”\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nIt's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed, especially with so much on your mind. Let's take a step back and approach this one piece at a time. How about we start with a few reflective questions to help you gain clarity?\n\nWhat specific aspects of your life are causing you the most stress right now?\nWhen you think about your ideal work situation, what does it look like?\nHow can you incorporate small moments of joy or peace into your day?\nWhat support systems or resources can you lean\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n“Yeah, Habibi? Yeah, so one, I think the most amount of stress is sort of like just feeling like I'm far from my family, that I don't really know about money and like what to do with my financial situation because the whole world seems topsy-turvy, and I guess I, you kn...[truncated]",
