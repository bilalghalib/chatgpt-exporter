ITC is 100% \"Aid for Trade\", supporting trade that\ndelivers inclusive and sustainable development results. ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and\ntransition economies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs) Fragile States and Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. To support a more inclusive distribution of development gains, ITC works with women, youth, and\nmarginalized groups in developing countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that\nprovide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation.\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq, implemented by UN-Habitat, the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent\nwork and affordable housing. This multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive\ninvestment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq's National Public Works Programme, enhancing\ncapacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting trade-led private sector engagement in climate-\nsmart construction, and empowering social partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these\ncomponents, BEIT focuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools and\nlegislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social dialogue and capacity building\namong social partners, all to address housing challenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating\nclimate change impacts in the housing sector.\nOutput 3.3 of the project is designed to enhance the capabilities of local businesses, particularly focusing\non young entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative practices into their operations. This includes a\ncomprehensive approach to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the\ndevelopment of sustainable and innovative capabilities, especially in sectors like climate-smart solutions\nand innovative construction technology. The project plans to:\n1. Reinforce Business Development Services: Strengthening the portfolio of service providers to offer\ntraining, coaching, and mentoring in areas critical for sustainable and innovative business practices.\n2. Leverage Peer Learning: Facilitating learning from institutional and company-level peers to help\nentrepreneurs effectively understand and implement sustainable practices.\n3. Enhance TVET Alignment: Aligning Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs\nwith the needs of businesses to ensure practical and industry-relevant training.\n4.

Research on construction and housing sector in Iraq:\nTo get started, I'd recommend looking into reports from:\n- UN-Habitat (they have extensive work in Iraq)\n- World Bank reports on Iraq's construction sector\n- ILO reports on employment in Iraq's construction industry\n- Local Iraqi government resources on housing policies\n\n2. Building stakeholder relationships:\nIt's good that you're aware of Mosul Space. To expand your network:\n- Reach out to your UN-Habitat and ILO counterparts on the BEIT project\n- Contact local construction industry associations in Iraq\n- Connect with Iraqi universities that have architecture or civil engineering programs\n- Reach out to NGOs working on housing issues in Iraq\n\n3. Competency-based curriculum development:\nSome recommended frameworks and methodologies:\n- ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation)\n- Bloom's Taxonomy for learning objectives\n- Kirkpatrick's Four-Level Training Evaluation Model\n- Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach\n\n4. Travel limitations:\nUntil you can travel in August:\n- Set up virtual meetings with key stakeholders\n- Conduct online research and literature reviews\n- Begin developing the initial curriculum framework\n- Prepare detailed questions and areas to investigate when you do visit\n\n5. Local engagement:\nTo increase your understanding before visiting:\n- Set up virtual focus groups with local construction professionals\n- Arrange online interviews with Iraqi educators in relevant fields\n- Engage with Iraqi diaspora in the construction sector if possible\n\n6. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E):\nYour idea to link M&E with assessments is excellent. Consider:\n- Developing a comprehensive skills assessment tool that can be used pre- and post-training\n- Incorporating practical, scenario-based assessments that reflect real-world situations in Iraq's construction sector\n- Including both quantitative metrics (e.g., test scores) and qualitative feedback (e.g., self-assessment of confidence levels)\n\nGiven your current situation, here's a suggested plan to move forward:\n\n<antThinking>A project plan would be helpful for organizing the consultant's work and ensuring all deliverables are met on time.

Start building your network immediately. Reach out to your UN contacts for introductions to key stakeholders in Iraq.\n\n2. Begin documenting everything from day one. This will make report writing much easier later on.\n\n3. Consider creating a risk management plan, identifying potential challenges and mitigation strategies.\n\n4. Stay flexible. As you learn more about the local context, you may need to adjust your approach.\n\n5. Regular check-ins with your supervisor at ITC will be crucial. Plan for these from the beginning.\n\nDo you have any questions about this plan or need any clarification on how to proceed?",

Local engagement:\nTo increase your understanding before visiting:\n- Set up virtual focus groups with local construction professionals\n- Arrange online interviews with Iraqi educators in relevant fields\n- Engage with Iraqi diaspora in the construction sector if possible\n\n6. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E):\nYour idea to link M&E with assessments is excellent. Consider:\n- Developing a comprehensive skills assessment tool that can be used pre- and post-training\n- Incorporating practical, scenario-based assessments that reflect real-world situations in Iraq's construction sector\n- Including both quantitative metrics (e.g., test scores) and qualitative feedback (e.g., self-assessment of confidence levels)\n\nGiven your current situation, here's a suggested plan to move forward:\n\n<antThinking>A project plan would be helpful for organizing the consultant's work and ensuring all deliverables are met on time. This is substantial content that the consultant is likely to modify and reference multiple times, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"project-plan\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"BEIT Project Plan\">\n# BEIT Project Plan\n\n## Phase 1: Preparation and Research (July - August 2024)\n\n1.

It's designed to help you meet all the deliverables on time while ensuring thorough research, stakeholder engagement, and quality curriculum development.\n\nA few additional suggestions:\n\n1. Start building your network immediately. Reach out to your UN contacts for introductions to key stakeholders in Iraq.\n\n2. Begin documenting everything from day one. This will make report writing much easier later on.\n\n3. Consider creating a risk management plan, identifying potential challenges and mitigation strategies.\n\n4. Stay flexible. As you learn more about the local context, you may need to adjust your approach.\n\n5. Regular check-ins with your supervisor at ITC will be crucial. Plan for these from the beginning.\n\nDo you have any questions about this plan or need any clarification on how to proceed?",
