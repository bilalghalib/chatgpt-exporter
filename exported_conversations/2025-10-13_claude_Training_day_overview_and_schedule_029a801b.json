  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user requested help analyzing and presenting a comprehensive 5-day thermal improvement training program for Mosul, Iraq called \"BEIT.\" They wanted Claude to create structured tables showing the daily overview, homework assignments, social media strategy, design spaces (home vs. Mosul lab), key takeaways, overall flow and goals, then build a website to showcase everything. The user provided extensive training content covering heat transfer, insulation materials, roof coatings, wall treatments, air sealing, and business development for energy efficiency retrofits.\n\nClaude analyzed the training program and identified its core philosophy of \"Insulation is a Basic Right, Not a Luxury\" with a Learn-Apply-Sell daily structure. The program transforms participants from laborers into energy consultants through 60% hands-on lab work, real home practice, and evidence-driven methodology. Each day focuses on specific technical skills: Day 1 covers heat physics and home audits, Day 2 addresses roof coatings and ROI calculations, Day 3 handles wall insulation and mix ratios, Day 4 focuses on air sealing and service packaging, and Day 5 culminates in business pitches and portfolio assembly.\n\nClaude created comprehensive documentation including detailed daily breakdowns with learning objectives, homework assignments, social media posting strategies, and success metrics. The analysis revealed the program's unique approach of alternating between home-based practice and Mosul lab work, with participants documenting everything through WhatsApp groups and building professional portfolios. The training addresses Mosul's specific climate challenges (48°C+ summers, high cooling costs) and post-conflict reconstruction needs, incorporating cultural elements like Islamic framing and heritage ventilation methods. Claude then built a fully responsive website featuring the complete program overview, daily schedules, tools and platforms, success metrics, and post-training support systems, designed with Middle Eastern cultural sensitivity and professional presentation standards.",

Natural ventilation helps remove both heat and moisture and reduces AC run‑time.\nOn the sidebar, you see our Passive Balance goal: Heat In ≈ Heat Out—when your envelope is balanced, you need far fewer amps to stay cool.\nEvery intervention—insulation, sealing, or airflow—shifts this balance toward comfort and savings.”\nKey Points:\nYour home is one integrated system, not separate parts.\nManaging humidity and ventilation is as important as heat control.\nPassive balance (heat in ≈ heat out) minimizes energy use.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In dusty Mosul summers, trapping humid air makes rooms feel hotter—even if the temperature reading stays the same.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk: “Which part of the envelope—heat, air, or moisture—matters most in your home?”\nHave 2 volunteers point to the diagram, the humidity box, or the passive‑balance sidebar and explain why (20 s each).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Confusing convection vs. ventilation.\u000b – Solution: Point to arrow colors and the “Ventilation & Humidity” box: blue arrows = air leaks, green wavy arrows = moisture flow.\u000b • Issue: Ignoring humidity’s role.\u000b – Solution: Highlight the content box: proper humidity keeps you comfortable and protects against mold.\nTransition:\u000b “Great!

By insulating the roof, walls, and even windows, we reduce the amount of heat entering.\u000b That means the AC runs less, but we still feel comfortable.\u000b Insulation is a first-order fix — it’s something we do before thinking about buying a bigger or more powerful AC.”\n\nKey Points:\nHeat entering buildings drives up AC use.\nMore AC use means higher bills and more emissions.\nInsulation is a proactive solution — reduce the cause before treating the symptom.\n\nActivity Instructions:\nStep 1: Walk through the diagram from left to right, pointing at each step.\nStep 2: Give one quick example for each arrow (e.g., “When it’s 48°C outside…”).\nStep 3: Ask participants to name one part of their home that could be insulated.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Audience focuses on AC efficiency instead.\u000b Solution: Remind them insulation reduces need for AC, which has a bigger impact.\nIssue: Someone says “It’s too expensive.”\u000b Solution: Preview that you’ll cover cost savings and payback later in the module.\n\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we understand why insulation is the first step, let’s look at how heat actually moves into a building — our next slide is the Building Heat Gain Breakdown.”\n\n28\nBuilding Heat Gain Breakdown\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWe'll address each systematically\nRoof: 70%\nTypical Fix Cost: 15 000 IQD /m²\nSimple ROI: 12 months\nWalls: 20%\nTypical Fix Cost: 10 000 IQD /m²\nSimple ROI: 18 months\nAir Leaks: 10%\nTypical Fix Cost: 5 000 IQD /m²\nSimple ROI: 6 months\n10:00 – 10:05 – Building Heat Gain Breakdown (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b • Show where heat enters and how fixing each area saves money over time.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide full‑screen with three percentage bars and cost/ROI sub‑bullets.\u000b • Participants remain seated.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck updated with cost & ROI details\u000b • Laser pointer or cursor\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify cost and ROI text is legible under each bar\u000b • Confirm pointer/device is working\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here’s our new breakdown:\u000b • Roof – 70 percent of heat gain. Fixing insulation costs about 15 000 IQD per square meter and typically pays back in 12 months.\u000b • Walls – 20 percent. Upgrading wall insulation runs around 10 000 IQD /m² with an 18‑month pay‑back.\u000b • Air leaks – 10 percent. Sealing gaps costs only 5 000 IQD /m² and returns its cost in as little as 6 months.\nBy focusing first on the roof, then walls, then air leaks, we maximize savings and habitable .”\nKey Points:\nHigher percentage → bigger impact, but also higher fix cost\nROI shows how long you wait to recoup your investment\nCombining fixes yields even faster overall pay‑back\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, a 100 m² tin‑roof upgrade can save over 200 kWh per month—paying back in about a year.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk: “Given these costs and ROIs, which area would you tackle first in your home?”\nInvite 2–3 participants to share their choice and reasoning (30 s each)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Fix cost seems high.\u000b – Solution: Emphasize long‑term savings—ROI\u000b • Issue: Confused by months vs. m².\u000b – Solution: Clarify: “Cost per square meter; ROI in calendar months”\nTransition:\u000b “Great insights!

He then had to pay again to redo the work, doubling his expense. This failure cost him money, trust, and left his home less habitable during the hottest days.\nQuality & longevity matter: when you invest in durable solutions, you invest in your reputation and in a home that stays comfortable and safe for years. That’s why we always ‘invest once, save long‑term.’”\nKey Points:\nCheap materials often fail quickly, costing more IQD and trust.\nA bad job harms your reputation—no referrals.\nDurable quality delivers lasting comfort and trust.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul’s intense sun, I’ve seen coatings blister and fall off in days—forcing multiple recoats and leaving families uncomfortable.”\nActivity Instructions:\nDisplay the peeled‑off and intact images.\nAsk: “Who here has seen a similar coating failure?”\nInvite 1–2 brief responses (30 s each) linking it to trust and home habitability.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: No one recalls a fast peel.\u000b – Solution: Prompt with any photo or fading they’ve noticed on local homes.\u000b • Issue: Participants want technical specs now.\u000b – Solution: Reassure: “We’ll cover material durability and selection in Day 2; today we’re focusing on why quality leads to a habitable home.”\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we understand the stakes of durability and trust, let’s explore Your Home as an Energy Envelope.”\n\n30\nاختبار الطابق الثاني - The Second-Floor Comfort Test\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nBenchmark: ΔT (ground floor vs 2nd floor) ≤ 3°C = PASS ✓\n\nإذا قدرت تعيش بالطابق الثاني… فأنت وصلت المرحلة الممتازة\n\"If you can live on the second floor... you have reached the excellent stage\" - Omar\n\n\n\n💡 Success metric teams can SELL to customers\n\n31\nHeat Transfer & Insulation Comparison\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMaterial\nDominant Mode\nU-Value (W/m²·K)\nR-Value (m²·K/W)\nTypical Use\nConcrete roof\nConduction\n0.8\n1.25\nExisting flat roofs\nInsulated panel\nConduction\n0.3\n3.33\nRetrofits & new roofs\nConcrete wall\nConduction\n1.2\n0.83\nUninsulated exterior walls\nSilicone coating\nRadiation\n5.0*\n0.20\nThin reflective surface\nElastomeric coating\nRadiation\n4.0*\n0.25\nFlexible sealant coatings\nAir gap + vented ridge\nConvection\n0.5\n2.00\nVentilated attic systems\n10:30 – 10:40 – How Heat Moves & Insulation Comparison (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b • Reinforce conduction/convection/radiation modes and show how different materials slow heat flow (via U- and R-values).\nSetup:\u000b • Display comparison table slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants seated, ready to discuss.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with table.\u000b • Laser pointer or cursor.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm table columns are legible from back of room.\u000b • Make sure pointer is aligned with each row.\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here’s a quick comparison of common building materials and how they handle heat. Each material’s U-value shows how fast heat moves through it—the lower, the better. Its R-value is just 1 ÷ U, telling us how well it resists heat flow.\nFor example, a concrete roof at U = 0.8 (R = 1.25) leaks heat faster than an insulated panel at U = 0.3 (R = 3.33). Coatings reflect heat (radiation) but have high U-values unless very thick. And adding a ventilated air gap uses convection to remove heat before it even touches the ceiling below.”\nKey Points:\nLower U-value = better insulation.\nR-value = resistance; bigger is better.\nMatch material to mode: coatings for radiation; panels and vents for conduction/convection.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, switching from bare concrete roof (U = 0.8) to insulated panel (U = 0.3) cut summer roof heat gain by over 60 percent.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk participants: “Which material on this table would you choose first for your project and why?”\nInvite two volunteers to point to their row and explain how it slows heat.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Confusing U- vs. R-values.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “R = 1 ÷ U.”\u000b • Issue: Misidentifying dominant mode.\u000b – Solution: Refer to the “Dominant Mode” column icons—flame for conduction, wind for convection, sun for radiation.\nTransition:\u000b “With this material guide in mind, let’s move on to Slow the Flow: Insulation Strategies, where we’ll pick the best fixes for each heat-transfer mode.”\n\n32\nHow Heat Moves: Conduction, Convection, Radiation\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMode\nConduction\nHeat through solids 🔥\nConvection\nHeat with moving air 🌬️\nRadiation\nHeat by waves ☀️\nU-value = heat transfer rate\nLower = better insulation\nConcrete roof: 0.8 W/m²·K\nConcrete wall: 1.2 W/m²·K\nSingle glass: 5.0 W/m²·K\nWith insulation: divide by 2.5\n10:40 – 10:50 How Heat Moves & U‑Values (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b To reinforce the three heat‑transfer modes and introduce U‑values as a measure of insulation performance.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen showing the three icons and U‑value table\u000b • Participants remain seated from the previous activity\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with icons and U‑value table\u000b • Pointer or laser\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Check icons and U‑value numbers are large and legible\u000b • Ensure slide follows immediately after the demo slide\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Let’s recap the three ways heat travels: conduction through solids, convection with moving air, and radiation by waves. You can see each mode represented with an icon: a flame for conduction, wind for convection, and sun rays for radiation.\n“Next we introduce U‑values—the rate at which a material transfers heat. The lower the U‑value, the better the insulation. For example, a concrete roof has U = 0.8 W/m²·K, concrete walls U = 1.2, and single‑pane glass U = 5.0. If we add insulation, we divide these values by about 2.5, dramatically cutting heat flow. Understanding U‑values helps us choose the right materials to slow each heat‑transfer mode.”\nKey Points:\nThree modes: conduction, convection, radiation.\nU‑value measures heat transfer per area per temperature difference.\nLower U‑values mean better insulation; adding insulation divides U‑value by ~2.5.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “In Mosul, switching from single‑pane windows (U = 5.0) to insulated panels (U ≈ 2.0) can cut wall heat gain by over 60 percent.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk: “Which building element in your project has the highest U‑value?”\nInvite two volunteers to name an element (e.g., window or roof) and suggest an insulation idea that lowers its U‑value.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Confusion between lower U‑value and thicker walls.\u000b – Solution: Explain: “It’s about material properties, not just thickness.”\nIssue: Participants forget to divide by 2.5 after insulation.\u000b – Solution: Emphasize: “Think: new U = old U ÷ 2.5.”\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we know how to slow heat flow in materials, let’s cover some essential precautions before our hands‑on activities.

everyone can see slide.\u000b – No movement required.\nMaterials needed\u000b – Slide projected.\u000b – Ladder, mask, water jug on demo table.\nPre-activity checks\u000b – Ensure a sturdy ladder is visible.\u000b – One clean mask per participant.\u000b – Water jug is filled.\nFacilitator Script\n“Before we get hands-on, let’s cover three must-do safety steps: ladder, mask, and water.”\nKey Points\n🪜 Always keep three points of contact on ladders.\n😷 Wear a mask when you see dust or smoke.\n💧 Drink water every 20 minutes, especially in heat.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Last summer, a trainee slipped because they forgot to face the ladder—easy to avoid with these steps.”\nActivity Instructions\nPoint to the ladder icon and demo a 3-point grip on the ladder beside you.\nHold up the mask and show correct fit over nose and mouth.\nPour a cup of water—invite one participant to take a sip.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Mask fogs glasses →\u000b Solution: Pinch the nose clip for a snug seal.\nIssue: Ladder wobbles →\u000b Solution: Check foot placement and ground level before climbing.\nIssue: Forgetting water →\u000b Solution: Set alarms on your phone as reminders.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—everyone’s safe and ready. Next, we jump into our Home-Audit Sprint, where you’ll log room temperatures and leaks.”\n\n43\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n44\nHome-Audit Simulation Sprint\nForm teams of 3–4 👥\nEach team gets on Auditmybeit\nYou have 30 minutes total ⏲️\nDay 1\nTrack actual generator amps throughout the day - this is your baseline for savings calculations\n11:05 – 11:35 Home‑Audit Sprint (30 min)\nPurpose – Start a minimal but consistent audit baseline that will feed your insulation ROI choices.\u000b Setup – Teams logged in; one laptop per team.\u000b Materials – AuditMyBEIT access; IR thermometer; smoke pen; phone camera.\u000b Pre-checks – Everyone sees Buildings and Audits (+).\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Teams of 3–4. Log in to AuditMyBEIT, open Buildings, and start a new audit via Audits (+). Over the next 30 minutes, you’ll capture orientation and windows area for the hottest façade, list roof and exterior wall materials, log your cooling system and electricity context, and take a generator amp photo as your baseline.”\nKey Points – Quick, consistent, field-realistic data beats guesswork; naming matters for tracking.\u000b Transition – “Let’s begin with room temperatures—Step 1.”\n\n45\nHome-Audit Sprint \nStep 1 – Measure Room Temperatures\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTeams: 3–4 people\nTime: 10 min\nTools:\nInfrared thermometer\nPhone camera (optional)\nAuditMyBEIT open\n\nInstructions:\nStructure → Floors → Rooms\nAdd the room you are in (type + dimensions).\nThermal Photos\nTake 2 readings: mid-wall & near ceiling.\nUpload 2 photos (or a single photo + note) and caption each with the temperature (e.g., “Bedroom-A mid-wall 29.3 °C”, “ceiling 35.1 °C”).\n11:35 – 11:45 – Step 1 – Measure Room Temperatures (10 min)\nPurpose – Capture vertical temperature stratification to justify insulation/air-sealing priorities.\u000b Setup – Teams in a room; AuditMyBEIT open on Structure; IR thermometers distributed.\u000b Pre-checks – Thermometers working; teams can access Thermal Photos.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Add this room in Structure → Floors → Rooms with basic dimensions. Now take two temperature readings—mid-wall and near the ceiling. Upload the photos in Thermal Photos and put the exact °C values in the caption. If you use the workbook, duplicate the values in the Indoor Temp cells.”\nKey Points – Two heights show stratification; higher ceiling temps typically indicate heat gain and poor mixing.\u000b Common Issues & Fixes – Reading fluctuates → hold steady 5 s; ceiling too high → 45° upward from mid-wall.\u000b Transition – “Temps logged—now we hunt for infiltration.”\n\n46\nHome-Audit Sprint \nStep 2 – Detect Air Leaks\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTeams: 3–4 people\nTime: 10 min\nTools:\nIncense stick or smoke pen\nFlashlight\nAuditMyBEIT open\nInstructions:\nInspect window/door frames and joints with smoke.\nThermal Photos\nUpload 1–2 photos (or short clips).\nCaption with Leak / No Leak and location (e.g., “Leak ✓ – Window NE corner”).\nImprovements\nAdd an item: “Air sealing at ___ (weather-strip/caulk)”.\n11:45 – 11:55 – Step 2 – Detect Air Leaks (10 min)\nPurpose – Make infiltration visible and tie it to a concrete action (air sealing).\u000b Setup – Same room; smoke pens distributed; app on Thermal Photos/Improvements.\u000b Pre-checks – Everyone can add a photo and create an improvement item.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Move the smoke slowly around frames and edges. If it drifts, that’s a leak—document with a photo in Thermal Photos and clearly label the caption Leak or No Leak with the location. Then add an Improvement called ‘Air sealing at ___’. If your template allows, add an estimated cost or priority.”\nKey Points – Photos + labeled evidence support convincing, low-cost fixes.\u000b Common Issues & Fixes – Smoke too thick → tiny puffs; can’t upload now → take photo and add later, but write it down.\u000b Transition – “Now let’s lock in your power context—generator and grid.”\n\n47\nHome-Audit Sprint \nStep 3 – Log Generator Use & Site Photos\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTeams: 3–4 people\nTime: 10 min\nTools:\nGenerator amp meter\nSmartphone camera\nAuditMyBEIT open\n\nInstructions:\nElectricity\nGrid: enter annual meter reading (if available).\nPublic generator: tick if used → enter monthly amperes.\nPrivate generator: tick if used → enter power, fuel type (gasoline/diesel/LPG), fuel consumption.\nSolar panels: tick and enter power (if present).\nBaseline proof\nTake a photo of the amp meter now; upload (Thermal Photos) with caption “Baseline = __ A”.\n11:55 – 12:05 – Step 3 – Log Generator Use & Site Photos (10 min)\nPurpose – Capture electricity context and a verifiable amp baseline that will anchor savings calculations.\u000b Setup – Teams near the panel/meter; app open on Electricity.\u000b Pre-checks – Confirm teams know which generator(s) apply (public/private).\nFacilitator Script\u000b “In Electricity, record what you actually use: grid reading if available; Public generator monthly amperes; Private generator power and fuel. If you have solar, enter power. Now take a photo of the amp reading and upload it—caption ‘Baseline = __ A’. If you’re using the calculator, convert to tons with Volts × Amps ÷ 3.5 and enter the number.”\nKey Points – This ties real-world power use to comfort-cost tradeoffs and later ROI.\u000b Common Issues & Fixes – No access to meter → use last known reading and note it; unsure generator type → ask owner/manager and log the assumption.\u000b Transition – “Excellent—baseline complete. We’ll use this audit to prioritize insulation and air-sealing interventions next.”\n\n48\nAuto‑Outputs\nInputs\nCost & Savings Snapshot\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWindow Area (m²)\nCurrent AC Size (Tons)\nPeak Cooling Load (Tons)\nOversized by (%)\nPotential Savings (IQD/month)\n📊 SPREADSHEET MOMENT \u000bOpen the Energy Calculator tab\n12:05 – 12:15 Energy Calculator – Cost & Savings Snapshot (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\u000b Show participants the immediate impact of their audit data on peak cooling load, system oversizing, and monthly savings.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the live Energy Calculator workbook (or a clear screenshot) on the screen.\u000b • Ensure everyone’s workbook is open to the Cooling Load Summary section.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Laptops/tablets with the Energy Calculator tab open\u000b • Projector or large screen\u000b • Pointer or remote\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify that Window Area and Current AC Size (yellow cells) have been entered.\u000b • Confirm that the formulas in the Peak Cooling Load, Oversized by %, and Potential Savings fields are recalculating.\nFacilitator Script:\n“Now that you’ve entered your two yellow inputs—Window Area and Current AC Size—let’s interpret the results. On the right, you see:\nPeak Cooling Load (Tons): the capacity your system must handle.\nOversized by (%): how much larger your current AC is compared to the optimal size.\nPotential Savings (IQD/month): the monthly fuel‑cost reduction if you right‑size or retrofit.\u000b\nLet’s do a quick demo: Who measured a 2 m² window and entered 0.8 Tons AC? Enter those values now and watch the numbers update.”\nKey Points:\nOnly the two yellow cells drive all outputs.\nPeak Cooling Load shows true system demand.\nOversized by % reveals inefficiency you can eliminate.\nPotential Savings quantifies the monthly benefit.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Basra, halving an oversize of 40 % saved households around 25 M IQD per month—just like this.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk a volunteer team to enter their audit’s Window Area and AC Size.\nObserve the Peak Cooling Load, Oversized by %, and Potential Savings fields.\nDiscuss briefly what this savings figure means for budgeting.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Outputs don’t refresh after entry.\u000b Solution: Click any blank cell or press F9 to recalculate.\nIssue: Participants misunderstand “Oversized by.”\u000b Solution: Clarify: “If your AC is 20 % oversized, you pay for 120 % of needed capacity.”\u000b\nTransition:\n“Now that you’ve seen the clear monthly savings, remember: Invest Once, Not Twice—we’ll continue after break.”\n\n49\nProject‑Wide Data Pipeline\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nCustomer Intake \n    ↓  \nEnergy Calculator \n    ↓  \nQuote Generator \n    ↓  \nProject Tracker\n12:15 - 12:20 – Project‑Wide Data Pipeline (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Show how one client entry travels through all workbook modules to give us a complete pipeline.\n\nSetup:\n  • Trainer computer with the BEIT Insulation Workbook open.\n  • Excel focused on Customer Intake tab, ready for paste.\n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Clipboard with one filled sample row from Customer Intake.\n  • Access to Quote Generator and Project Tracker tabs in the same file.\n\nPre‑activity checks:\n  • Ensure “Team Code” column exists in Customer Intake.\n  • Verify Energy Calculator formulas are enabled.\n  • Confirm Quote Generator fields are linked to Intake and Calculator.\n  • Check Project Tracker has an empty row for a new lead.\n\nFacilitator Script:\n  “Let’s see how a single intake record powers our entire workflow—from data capture to lead tracking—in under five minutes.”\n\nKey Points:\nAll teams paste into Customer Intake (yellow input cells).\nEnergy Calculator auto‑fills geometry and tariff—no re‑typing.\nQuote Generator pulls in summary and investment options automatically.\nProject Tracker records the new lead for follow‑up.\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1 (0:30) – Paste sample row into Customer Intake; enter Team Code “INS‑T3‑Mosul”.  \n  Step 2 (1:30) – Switch to Energy Calculator; highlight the auto‑filled fields (roof area, current AC size).  \n  Step 3 (2:30) – Go to Quote Generator; point out that Executive Summary and Investment Options are populated.  \n  Step 4 (3:30) – Copy the generated Quote #; navigate to Project Tracker and paste it into the “Leads” section.  \n  Success criteria – You see a new lead line in Project Tracker with correct Quote # and client name.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  Issue: Intake row didn’t paste into Calculator.  \n    Solution: Confirm you pasted into the proper table row—not below the formatted range.  \n  Issue: Quote fields remain blank.  \n    Solution: Return to Intake, ensure Team Code is in place, then reopen Quote Generator tab.\n\nTransition:\n  “Perfect—our workbook is a single source of truth.

Despite similar climates, material choice makes a huge difference in indoor comfort.\nNotice how the stone walls have thicker profiles and overhangs, while the concrete facades lack shading and thermal mass controls. This illustrates why, after walls and windows, the roof is our next critical frontier for reducing heat gain.”\n\nKey Points:\nThermal mass: Stone’s density buffers temperature swings.\nShading & overhangs: Traditional designs minimize direct solar absorption.\nModern concrete: High U‑value drives indoor heat load.\u000b\nLocal Example:\n“In Basra’s old neighborhoods, we saw indoor temperatures 5 °C lower in stone homes versus nearby concrete flats without any AC.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\nDiscuss with your neighbor: what passive feature from the stone houses could you apply to a retrofit?\nJot down one idea (e.g., reflective paint, added overhangs) for your roof solution.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Participants focus only on walls.\nSolution: Redirect: “We’ll cover walls in Day 3—today is about the roof.”\nIssue: “That’s for new builds only.”\nSolution: Emphasize retrofit potential (shade sails, reflective coatings).\n\nTransition:\n“Armed with these insights on materials, let’s dive into our next slide: Roof Heat‑Gain & Investment, where we’ll quantify roof losses and explore cost‑effective insulation options.”\n\n70\nBuilding Envelope Systems\nDay 2\nWWR (Window‑to‑Wall Ratio) =  Window Area ÷ Total Wall Area\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n(09 : 40 – 09 : 45) Building Envelope Systems (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Introduce Window‑to‑Wall Ratio (WWR) as a key metric in the Energy Calculator → Building Geometry tab and show how it guides façade interventions.\nSetup:\nSlide with formula “WWR = Window Area ÷ Total Wall Area” projected full‑screen\nParticipants remain seated with workbooks open to Building Geometry\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nSlide deck\nParticipant workbooks or print‑outs of Building Geometry section\u000b\nPre‑activity checks:\nEnsure the formula and areas (wall & window) are visible on screen\nConfirm everyone’s workbook shows the Window Area and Wall Area cells\n\nFacilitator Script:\n“Next, let’s talk about the building envelope—specifically, how much glass you have relative to walls. In your Building Geometry section, you see Window Area and Wall Area. The Window‑to‑Wall Ratio, or WWR, is simply:\nWWR = Window Area ÷ Total Wall Area\nFor hot climates like Mosul, keep WWR ≤ 18 % for the whole building, and ≤ 10 % on south‑facing walls. North façades can tolerate more glazing; east, south, and west need shading or smaller windows.”\nKey Points:\nWindows transmit heat much faster than walls.\nWWR target: ≤ 18 % overall; ≤ 10 % on south exposures.\nYou can reduce WWR by adding shades, smaller openings, or low‑U glass.\u000b\nLocal Example:\n“Many Mosul homes have 30 % WWR on west walls—adding 1 m eaves there cut indoor ΔT by 3 °C in our pilot.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\nIn your workbook’s Building Geometry, note your Window Area and Wall Area.\nCalculate your own WWR (divide window by wall).\nVolunteers: shout out your WWR and suggest one quick fix (shade, film, or resizing).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Mixing up wall vs. roof area.\nSolution: Point to the “Wall Area (m²)” row in Building Geometry.\nIssue: Forgetting south‑facing rule.\nSolution: Remind: “South gets extra sun—aim for 10 % or less.”\u000b\nTransition:\n“Great—now that we understand windows, let’s dive deep to the building envelope systems.”\n\n71\nRoof Heat‑Gain & Investment\nDay 2\n🌞 Roof accounts for most solar gain—insulate first for biggest habitable‑home impact.\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nArea\n% Heat Gain\n💵 Fix Cost (IQD/m²)\n⏳ ROI (months)\nRoof\n60–70 %\n15 000 IQD\n12 months (Second)\n Walls\n20–25 %\n10 000 IQD\n18 months (Longest)\nLeaks\n10–15 %\n5 000 IQD\n6 months (Fastest) \nMiscellaneous \n10% \nN.A.\nDon’t  kick your kids out.\nWHERE DO THESE NUMBERS COME FROM?\nComponent\nU‑value (W/m²·K)\nTypical Thickness (mm)\nMarket Cost (IQD /m²)\nEPS Roof Board\n0.45\n50\n15 000\nReflective Coat\n1.50\n2\n9 500\nPerlite Render\n0.65\n30\n18 000\n10:00 – 10:10 Roof Heat‑Gain & Investment (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Build trust by showing headline numbers, data sources, and key assumptions behind our cost & ROI figures.\n\nSetup:\nTrainer laptop/projector on this slide.\nSlide deck open to the updated table with banner + footnote.\n\nMaterials needed:\nSlide with updated table, banner, and footnote.\nLaser pointer or cursor.\nPre‑activity checks:\nConfirm the banner (“WHERE DO THESE NUMBERS COME FROM?”) is fully visible.\nFootnote “¹ Roof = 60–70 %…” is legible.\nTable columns display correctly with icons.\nFacilitator Script:\n  “Here are our ‘big three’ heat pathways in summer.

Our goal is to let in enough daylight while keeping heat out. Windows and doors pass heat five times faster than solid walls. We measure their impact with the Window‑to‑Wall Ratio, or WWR. The formula is simple: window area divided by total wall area above ground.\nFor hot cities like Mosul, we aim for 18 % or less across the whole building and 10 % or less on south‑facing rooms. Large windows belong on the north side, where the sun is weakest. On west, east, and south façades we shrink glazing or add exterior shades.\nLook at the left photo—small, recessed windows equal low heat gain.

damp walls need interior protection or a hybrid approach.”\n\nKey Points:\nDry walls benefit most from exterior EPS – it wraps the structure and blocks weather.  \nWet walls require interior perlite plaster or a hybrid to avoid trapping moisture.\nEach option has trade‑offs in space, cost, and maintenance.\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1 (0:30) – Ask: “Does anyone know a building here with damp walls?”  \n  Step 2 (1:30) – Point to the tree: have teams shout “Inside” or “Outside” based on their example.  \n  Step 3 (2:30) – Highlight pros & cons: invite one volunteer to name a pro and one to name a con.  \n  Success criteria – Teams can correctly explain which branch of the tree applies to their local examples.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Confusing moisture source vs. humidity.\n   Solution: Clarify “dry wall” means no visible leaks or rising damp.  \nIssue: Belief that exterior is always better.\n   Solution: Emphasize the moisture risk and need for a vapor barrier if outside.\n\nTransition:\n  “Now that we’ve picked our wall strategy, let’s review all solution categories on the next slide: Solution Categories Map.”  \n\n82\nSolution Categories Map\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nProblem\nLocation\nSolution Options\nCost Range\nHeat Gain\nRoof\nCoating/Insulation/Shade\n15-50k/m²\nHeat Gain\nWalls\nInsulation/Coating\n20-35k/m²\nAir Leaks\nGaps\nSealing/Weatherstrip\n5-15k/m\n10:20 – 10:25 Solution Categories Map (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Provide a quick reference to the main problem areas, their locations, solution types, and typical cost ranges so teams can choose the right fix.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full‑screen with the solution table\u000b • Participants seated and able to view clearly\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Ensure each column (Problem, Location, Solutions, Cost) is legible\u000b • Confirm cost units (IQD/m² or IQD/m) are clear\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here’s our Solution Categories Map. We’ve broken down the three main heat‑entry problems—roof, walls, and air leaks—into where they occur, which solutions work best, and what you can expect to pay. For roofs, you can choose coatings, insulation panels, or shade structures at roughly 15,000–50,000 IQD per square meter. For walls, coatings or insulation cost about 20,000–35,000 IQD per square meter. And for air leaks, sealing and weatherstripping run about 5,000–15,000 IQD per linear meter. Use this map to estimate and compare interventions quickly during your field work.”\n\nKey Points:\nRoof fixes yield the highest impact but can vary more in cost (15–50 k IQD/m²).\nWall treatments are next, with moderate cost and impact (20–35 k IQD/m²).\nAir‑leak sealing is cheapest and fastest (5–15 k IQD/m) but tackles only 10 % of heat gain.\nAlways match solution type to the problem location for best ROI.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, a simple shade cloth over a tin roof cost only 20 k IQD/m² and cut roof heat by 30 percent.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk each team to pick one problem area they audited (roof, wall, or leak).\nHave them note on their flipchart which solution option and cost range they’d recommend.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams confuse cost per m² vs per m.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Roof and walls are per square meter; leaks are per meter of gap.”\nIssue: Uncertainty about which solution fits their site.\u000b – Solution: Encourage: “Choose the lowest‑cost option that still meets durability needs.”\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now let’s dive into our first set of material tests with Three Common Coatings and see how they perform under real sun.”\n\n83\nCommon Coatings\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nType\nCost (IQD/L)\nCLTD Reduction (°C)\nCoverage (m²/L)\nROI @150 m² (months)\nAcrylic\n15 000\n3 – 4\n3.5\n20\nElastomeric\n25 000\n5 – 7\n3.2\n16\nSilicone\n30 000\n6 – 8\n3.0\n12\nAssumes generator cost 800 IQD/kWh.\n(10:25 – 10:35) Three Common Coatings (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b • Introduce cost‑to‑performance trade‑offs and show how pay‑back periods compare for a 150 m² roof.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide displayed full‑screen with updated table.\u000b • Lay out three demo tiles (Acrylic, Elastomeric, Silicone) labeled A/B/C.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Slide deck with table including ROI column.\u000b • Three labeled coating samples on tile pieces.\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm each demo tile matches its table row.\u000b • Ensure “IQD” labels and ROI values are clear.\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here are the three coatings you’ll test and their ROI for a 150 m² roof:\u000b • Acrylic costs 15 000 IQD/L, cuts 3–4 °C, covers 3.5 m²/L, lasts 4–5 yrs, and pays back in about 20 months.\u000b • Elastomeric costs 25 000 IQD/L, cuts 5–7 °C, covers 3.2 m²/L, lasts 6–7 yrs, with an ROI of 16 months.\u000b • Silicone costs 30 000 IQD/L, cuts 6–8 °C, covers 3.0 m²/L, lasts 7–8 yrs, and pays back in 12 months.\nThese ROI estimates assume a generator rate of 800 IQD per kWh.* Keep price, cooling impact, coverage, and longevity in mind as you move into the scratch‑test demo.”\nKey Points:\nCost vs. pay‑back shows which coatings return your investment fastest.\nHigher CLTD saves more energy, reducing pay‑back time.\nDurability extends long‑term savings, making your home truly habitable.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, spending more on silicone pays off—you avoid multiple recoats and keep homes cooler for years.”\nActivity Instructions:\nFeel each tile’s texture and compare to the table’s notes.\nNote the ROI and durability values for each sample.\nPrepare for the Scratch‑Test Demo to validate real performance.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Confusing CLTD with coverage.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Coverage is how many m² one liter paints.”\u000b • Issue: Misreading ROI months.\u000b – Solution: Point out the ROI column and footnote about 800 IQD/kWh.\nTransition:\u000b “Now that you know what you’re testing, let’s find out about Which coating will last 5 years?.”\n\n84\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2\nHow long does each type of coating last? \u000bWrite your guess and share now.\n10:35 – 10:40 – Prediction Prompt: “Which coating will last 5 yrs?” (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b • Engage teams to think critically about durability and link quality to trust.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide with the question displayed full‑screen.\u000b • Participants seated with scratch‑rating sheets in hand.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Scratch‑rating sheet or notebook.\u000b • Pen or pencil.\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm every team has a sheet and writing tool.\u000b • Ensure slide text is clear and legible.\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Before we test, let’s make a prediction: which coating—Acrylic, Elastomeric, or Silicone—will survive five years with minimal damage?

Don’t press too hard—just enough to test surface adhesion. Look for any chipping or flaking, then record a durability rating from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) on our board under column A. Next, repeat the same steps on Sample B (Silicone) and Sample C (Elastomeric). Finally, we’ll test a perlite plaster sample (D); notice its granular texture trapping air and how it resists your scrape differently.”\n\nKey Points:\nGentle pressure tests real‑world wear, not brute force.\nChips and flakes indicate weak adhesion or low durability.\nGranular perlite traps air—compare how it breaks versus coatings.\nStar ratings make side‑by‑side comparison quick and clear.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, coatings rated below 3 chipped within days of rain—that’s why durability matters in dusty, wet seasons.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\nTeams come up one at a time to scratch Sample A, then B, C, and D.\nAfter each scratch, note any flaking and assign a rating 1–5 on the board under the matching column.\nRotate until every team has tested all four samples.\nCompare ratings to see which material performs best.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams press too hard, breaking the surface.\u000b – Solution: Demonstrate “light, steady drag”—use fingertip pressure only.\nIssue: Inconsistent star ratings.\u000b – Solution: Ask, “Did you see more than three flakes? If yes, rate below 3.”\nIssue: Perlite dust everywhere.\u000b – Solution: Scratch slowly and catch loose grains on a tray.\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent observations!

Now let’s connect what you saw to customer trust and cost. Look at the tiles that flaked or chipped: any time a coating fails early, the owner pays again—doubling or tripling costs. This is why we say ‘Cheap now = pay later.’\nWhich sample had the most damage, and what would it cost to re‑coat a 150 m² roof at that same rate? Think about the IQD and lost trust when you have to return for repairs.”\n\nKey Points:\nFlaking during testing predicts real‑world failures—each recoat adds expense.\nDurable solutions protect both the home’s comfort and your reputation.\nQuality investments foster lasting client trust and fewer callbacks.\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, homeowners who chose the cheapest paint in 2020 ended up recoating twice that season—costing them over 30 million IQD extra and hurting their installer’s referrals.”\nActivity Instructions:\nAsk each team to share which coating scored lowest for durability.\nOn the flipchart, jot next to each coating the estimated recoat cost (ℹ️ 150 m² × IQD/L × cost per litre).\nDiscuss: “How would you explain this cost to a customer to build trust?”\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Difficulty translating test damage to cost.\u000b – Solution: Walk through one example calculation on the board.\u000b • Issue: Teams focus only on numbers.\u000b – Solution: Remind: “Also explain the impact on customer peace of mind.”\nTransition:\u000b “Now that we’ve seen why durability—and trust—matter, let’s watch our Case Study Video: 5‑Year Silicone Failure to learn even more.”\n\n88\nCase Study Video – 5-Year Silicone Failure\nDay 2\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nCheap now ➜ Double spend later\n11:10 – 11:20 Case Study Video – 5‑Year Silicone Failure (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show long‑term consequences of choosing low‑grade coatings versus investing in quality—reinforcing that “cheap now = pay later.”\nSetup:\u000b • Slide up, projector and sound on\u000b • Video cued to start at the right point\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Downloaded or streamed video clip\u000b • Speakers or room audio system\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Play 5 seconds to confirm audio and video clarity\u000b • Adjust volume so everyone can hear\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “We’re going to watch a short clip illustrating why ‘cheap now = pay later.’ This shows a low‑cost silicone coating that begins cracking and flaking by year 5 due to UV and heat cycling.

Use the brush to sweep off loose particles, then wipe corners and edges with the cloth—your goal is a visibly clean, smooth tile.”\n\nKey Points\nDust removal prevents coating from trapping particles.\nEdge cleaning ensures full coverage next.\nVisual check—tile should look uniformly clean.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In dusty Mosul homes, uncleaned tiles can cause tiny cracks later—so take your time here.”\n\nActivity Instructions\nPick up the brush and gently sweep the tile surface.\nWipe down with the damp cloth, focusing on corners.\nInspect under good light—no dust should remain.\nRaise your hand when done; you’ll rotate to Station 2.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Cloth leaves lint →\u000b Solution: Switch to a lint-free cloth or dry brush again.\nIssue: Teams rush and miss spots →\u000b Solution: Remind them to inspect from different angles.\u000b\nTransition\n“Excellent—once your tile is clean, head to Station 2 to apply your coating. Let’s keep the pace.”\n\n93\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nStation 2: Apply Coating\nDay 2\nEven brush strokes\n11:55 – 12:15 (20 min) Station 2 – Apply Coating\nPurpose\u000b Show how consistent application affects coverage and performance.\n\nSetup\nStations labeled “2” with clean tiles from Station 1.\nEach station has its assigned coating type and a brush.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nPre-mixed coating cans (Acrylic, Silicone, Elastomeric)\nBrushes or rollers\nStir sticks\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nEnsure coating is well-stirred.\nVerify brushes are clean and dry.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“At Station 2, you’ll apply your assigned coating using even, overlapping strokes. Cover the entire tile surface without leaving drips or pools—this simulates a professional finish.”\n\nKey Points\nEven strokes ensure uniform thickness.\nFull coverage prevents weak spots.\nNo drips avoids uneven drying and wastage.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, uneven coating caused water ingress at thin spots—taking time here prevents future leaks.”\n\nActivity Instructions\nStir your coating for 30 seconds.\nDip brush, apply one stroke across tile.\nOverlap each stroke by 20 %.\nCheck edges for full coverage.\nRaise hand when finished to rotate to Station 3.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Too much paint on brush →\u000b Solution: Wipe excess on rim before stroking.\nIssue: Uneven thickness →\u000b Solution: Keep strokes parallel and consistent speed.\u000b\nTransition\n“Well done—your tile is now coated.

As Ghassan’s story shows, choosing a budget acrylic at only 15 000 IQD/m² led to peeling in two weeks—then he paid twice to recoat with a better product. That doubled his cost and damaged his trust in the installer. By contrast, investing a bit more up front in quality coatings avoids that rework cost and builds your reputation.”\n\nKey Points:\nLow upfront cost can lead to high rework expenses.\nQuality products last longer and build trust and referrals.\nA one‑time premium saves money and protects your brand.\u000b\nLocal example:\n“In Mosul, clients who skimped on coating came back within months for a second job—paying 2× the original price.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\nThink about your ROI numbers—calculate the difference between a cheap coating and a premium option over one year.\nKeep Ghassan’s anecdote in mind when you role‑play objections in the next slide.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Teams doubt the magnitude of rework cost.\u000b – Solution: Highlight the “2×” repeat‑cost fact and tie it back to the customer’s budget.\nIssue: The phrase feels generic.\u000b – Solution: Encourage swapping in a local anecdote from Day 1 audits or your own experience.\nTransition:\u000b “Now that you know why this message works, let’s practice it in our 1‑minute role play.

In the Apply block, you’ll practice two hands-on tasks that put those learnings into action. And finally, in the Sell block, you’ll produce one proof or pitch deliverable that captures your work. Keep these objectives in mind as we move into the Learn session.”\nKey Points\nLearn: Understand the core concepts—ask questions if anything is unclear.\nApply: Use the tools and methods immediately—capture photos or data as evidence.\nSell: Create a shareable asset that demonstrates your progress for tomorrow’s pitch.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nGlance through each bullet to internalize the day’s goals.\nNote which deliverable (video, sheet, card, etc.) you’ll produce in the Sell block.\nWhen the slide disappears, we jump straight into the Learn session.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants miss which day they’re on →\u000b Solution: Verbally point to the highlighted row and restate “Today is Day X.”\nIssue: Overwhelm from many objectives →\u000b Solution: Emphasize that Learn and Apply each have only two bullets, and Sell has one—manageable chunks.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now let’s dive into our Learn session and master today’s first concept.”\n\n116\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\n117\nFoundations of Mix & Moisture\nDay 3\nWhy Moisture Matters?\nKey Ingredients:\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n09 : 35 – 09 : 45 (10 min) Foundations of Mix & Moisture\nPurpose\u000b Build foundational understanding of why proper moisture control and ingredients are critical before mixing.\nSetup\u000b – Participants seated; slide displayed.\u000b – No props needed yet.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – Slide deck only.\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Confirm slide visibility and icon clarity.\u000b – Ensure no distractions on screen.\nFacilitator Script\n“Before we mix, let’s cover the basics. Moisture is key: too little water and the plaster cracks; too much and it won’t set properly.”\nKey Points\nMoisture prevents shrinkage cracks.\nBinder (cement) gives strength.\nAggregate (sand) provides body and workability.\nWater activates the mix—use just enough.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul, some teams skipped adding water and saw panels crack within days—that’s why we emphasize balanced moisture.”\nActivity Instructions\nNote the three components on your notepad.\nThink of instances when you’ve seen plaster crack or sag.\nWe’ll use this foundation in our next live demo.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Participants question exact ratios now →\u000b Solution: Reassure: “We’ll cover precise ratios in the next slide.”\nIssue: Overload of terminology →\u000b Solution: Stick to the three core ingredients only.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now that we understand the ‘why,’ let’s learn the ‘how.’ Here’s our mix ratio and live demo.”\n\n118\nMix Ratios & Live Demo\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nRatio Example:\n1 part cement ⚪ : 3 parts sand 🟨 : 0.5 parts water 💧\nMoisture Tip:\nKeep the mix damp. No dry pockets.\n▶️ Live Demo\nAli mixed right → invited to client’s daughter’s wedding 3 yrs later\nRemember:  Cheap now = pay later\n09 : 45 – 10 : 00 (15 min) Mix Ratios & Live Demo\nPurpose:\u000b • Teach the 1 : 3 : 0.5 mix for strong, long‑lasting plaster and tie workmanship to reputation and cost savings.\nSetup:\u000b • Demo table front‑left with buckets of cement, sand, water, and trowels.\u000b • Sidebar and comparison photos visible on slide.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Cement, sand, measuring cups, water, trowel.\u000b • Cracked and perfect panel samples for photo reference.\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm measuring cups are accurate.\u000b • Ensure cracked vs. perfect panel images are clear.\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here’s our gold‑standard mix: 1 part cement, 3 parts sand, 0.5 part water—and keep it damp to avoid weak spots. Notice the call‑out: when Ali followed this exactly, he earned an invitation to his client’s daughter’s wedding three years later. That’s how quality builds reputation.\nLook at the comparison photos: the red × panel was eyeballed, cracked in months; the green ✓ panel was precise at 1 : 3 : 0.5 and still perfect today.\nRemember, cheap now → pay later if you skip these steps.”\nKey Points:\nAccurate ratio = consistent strength and workability.\nFlawless mixes earn repeat business (wedding‑invite story).\nCheap shortcuts lead to repair costs and lost trust.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, installers who skip the water check often end up recoating within a single dry season—doubling client costs and losing referrals.”\nActivity Instructions:\nWatch me measure each component precisely.\nI’ll demonstrate mixing and check for dry pockets.\nThen each team will mix their own batch and compare panel surfaces.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Too much water → mix slumps: add small dry mix until creamy.\u000b • Dry pockets → stir from the bottom for 60 seconds.\nTransition:\u000b “Great mixes! Next, we’ll explore the Supplier Treasure Hunt to choose the best wall solutions.”\n\n119\nExpensive = Cheap Pay‑Back Comparison\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nOption\nInitial Cost (IQD/m²)\nRe‑coat Interval (yrs)\nRe‑coat Cost (IQD/m²)\n7‑yr Total Cost (IQD/m²)\nStandard Mix\n× IQD▪▪▪\n2\n× IQD▪▪▪\nCalculate = Initial + 3×Re‑coat\nPremium Mix\n× IQD▪▪▪\n7\n× IQD▪▪▪\nCalculate = Initial + 1×Re‑coat\n10: 00 – 10 : 10 (10 min) Expensive = Cheap Pay‑Back Comparison\nPurpose:\u000b • Demonstrate that a higher up‑front investment can be cheaper over time by avoiding repeat recoats.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide “Expensive = Cheap Pay‑Back” displayed full‑screen.\u000b • Whiteboard or flipchart with two bars labeled “Standard” and “Premium.”\u000b • Markers available.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Team worksheets or phones for quick calculations.\u000b • Whiteboard or flipchart.\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm teams know their own initial and re‑coat IQD/m² numbers.\u000b • Ensure whiteboard is free and markers work.\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now that we’ve seen how glazing ratios and envelope balance save energy, let’s look at material costs over time. On the slide is a comparison: a Standard Mix that needs recoating every 2 years versus a Premium Mix that lasts 7 years.\nFill in your own Initial Cost and Re‑coat Cost per m².\nCalculate the 7‑year Total Cost: standard = initial + (7÷interval – 1)×re‑coat; premium = initial + 1×re‑coat.\nPlot your two bars on the whiteboard.”\u000b\nKey Points:\nA higher initial cost often eliminates multiple re‑coats—saving IQD.\nLifecycle cost trumps up‑front price for building a truly habitable home.\nVisual comparison cements the “expensive = cheap” insight.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, teams that paid 8 000 IQD/m² for premium mix saw total 7‑yr costs of ~10 000 IQD, versus ~20 000 IQD for cheap mixes that needed yearly recoats.”\nActivity Instructions:\nEach team enters their IQD values into the table on slide or worksheet.\nCompute the 7‑yr total for both options.\nOne member draws two bars on the whiteboard.\nBriefly discuss: “Which option wins long‑term, and how would you explain this to a homeowner?”\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Teams forget to subtract one coat.\u000b – Solution: Demonstrate formula: Total = Initial + (Years÷Interval – 1)×Re‑coat.\u000b • Issue: Whiteboard crowded.\u000b – Solution: Ask teams to draw small bars with labels.\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent! With this “expensive = cheap” proof in hand, let’s dive into our Supplier Treasure Hunt.”\n\n120\nSupplier Treasure Hunt\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nContact one coating supplier via phone or WhatsApp\nVerify three key data points:\nPrice (IQD per L)\nWarranty (years)\nCoverage (m²/L) at 35 °C surface temperature\nWin bonus points: first team to report back with all three answers - winner is the one who had the greatest price reduction from the first call.\n10: 10 – 10 : 20 (10 min) Supplier Treasure Hunt\nPurpose:\u000b • Build real-world supplier relationship skills and confirm critical data before selecting materials.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide “Supplier Treasure Hunt” displayed full-screen.\u000b • Teams seated with phones or tablets ready.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • List of local suppliers and contact info.\u000b • Phones or tablets with WhatsApp/calling capability.\u000b • Notepads or answer sheets.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Ensure each team has at least one working phone or tablet.\u000b • Confirm supplier contact list is accessible (printed or on screen).\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we’ll do a Supplier Treasure Hunt. Each team, pick one local coating supplier and contact them—by phone or WhatsApp—to confirm three critical values: the price in IQD per liter, the warranty in years, and the coverage in square meters per liter when the surface is at 35 °C. The first team to return and share all three correctly on our board earns bonus points. You have five minutes—go!”\nKey Points:\nVerifying data with suppliers builds credibility and ensures up-to-date figures.\nSupplier relationships are as important as technical specs.\nSpeed and accuracy both matter: bonus points for the quickest correct response.\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, one director called three vendors last month and discovered a special bulk-purchase discount—information not on the spec sheet.”\nActivity Instructions:\nChoose a supplier from your list.\nCall or WhatsApp them and ask for price, warranty years, and high-temp coverage.\nReturn to the front and announce your three confirmed values.\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Team can’t reach a supplier.\u000b – Solution: Switch to another contact on your list.\u000b • Issue: Supplier gives incomplete answers.\u000b – Solution: Politely follow up: “Could you please confirm your coverage at 35 °C?”\nTransition:\u000b “Great detective work! Now let’s move into our Materials Selection Matrix—add a ‘Verified contact?’ checkmark for the supplier you just called.”\n\n121\nMaterials Selection Matrix\nDay 3\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nProblem Type: Roof, Wall, Leak\nBudget Range: Low (≤ 15k IQD/m²) → High (≥ 60k IQD/m²)\nRecommended Materials: e.g., Acrylic Coating, EPS Boards, Weatherstripping\nSuppliers List: Local vendors stocking each material with contact info\n10:20 – 10:30 Materials Selection Matrix (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Introduce an interactive decision tool that matches the right material solution to the customer’s problem type and budget.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the interactive matrix on screen (or simulate with click‑through slides)\u000b • Participants seated, ready to follow along\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Laptop with the interactive spreadsheet or web tool loaded\u000b • Clicker or mouse for demo\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Verify the dropdown options work (Roof, Wall, Leak)\u000b • Test the budget slider to ensure materials list updates\u000b • Confirm supplier data is visible and accurate\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now we’ll use our Materials Selection Matrix—a tool to quickly match problems to the best solutions within a customer’s budget. First, choose a Problem Type from the dropdown: Roof, Wall, or Leak. Next, adjust the Budget Range slider to reflect what the customer can spend today—from low‑cost at 15 000 IQD per square meter up to premium at 60 000 IQD. The matrix then auto‑populates recommended materials—like Acrylic Coating for tight budgets or EPS Boards for mid‑range—and lists local suppliers who carry them. This ensures you always propose feasible, cost‑aligned solutions.”\n\nKey Points:\nDropdown & slider let you tailor solutions on the fly.\nAuto‑populate removes guesswork—tools pick the right material.\nSupplier list speeds up ordering and builds credibility.\n\nLocal example:\n“When working in Mosul’s Old City, I use this matrix to select Perlite Overlay when budgets allow, or acrylic coating when funds are tight—then call the nearest supplier in 30 seconds.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\nI’ll demo: select Roof, set budget to 25 000 IQD/m²—see the matrix recommend Premium Coating and list two local vendors.\nNow in pairs, choose Wall and a budget of 10 000 IQD/m²—note which materials and suppliers appear.\nShare one pair’s selection with the group.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Dropdown not responding.\u000b – Solution: Click the header cell to reset the field and try again.\nIssue: Suppliers list too long.\u000b – Solution: Use the filter box at the top to narrow by district.\nIssue: Budget slider feels coarse.\u000b – Solution: Enter numeric value directly in the adjacent cell.\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now that you can match problems, budgets, and materials instantly, let’s see those materials in action in our Temperature‑Bet Demo.”\n\n122\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nYour ΔT Bet\nDay 3\nWrite your own 10 °C bet on a sticky note\nWill your wall sample beat it?\n10:30 – 10:35 Your ΔT Bet (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b • Engage teams to set a personal benchmark and focus on measurable ΔT improvement.\nSetup:\u000b • Slide “Your ΔT Bet” displayed full‑screen.\u000b • Sticky notes and pens distributed to each team.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Sticky notes (one per team)\u000b • Pens or markers\nPre‑activity checks:\u000b • Confirm every team has a sticky note and pen.\u000b • Make sure slide text is clear and legible.\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Before we watch the demo, make your own 10 °C bet: on your sticky note, write down whether you think your wall sample will achieve at least a 10 °C drop in surface temperature. Be bold—this bet will guide your attention during the video and lab.”\nKey Points:\nSetting a target drives focus and accountability.\n10 °C is ambitious but achievable with proper materials and application.\nYour bet reinforces the link between data and customer promise.\nLocal Example:\u000b “Last month, one Mosul team bet 12 °C—and their sample actually hit 14 °C under test!”\nActivity Instructions:\nEach team writes a single-line bet on their sticky note (e.g., “Our panel will drop 10 °C”).\nPost it on the front board under “ΔT Bets.”\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b • Issue: Teams hesitate to commit.\u000b – Solution: Encourage: “It’s just a prediction—no penalty for missing, but you’ll learn more by aiming high.”\u000b • Issue: Sticky notes run out.\u000b – Solution: Tear off a small piece of scratch paper.\nTransition:\u000b “Great bets!

Run the fan at low speed to pressurize—this forces air through tiny gaps. Next, hold a smoke pencil near seams and watch where the smoke is drawn in or blown out. Each leak you find and seal saves a fraction of your generator capacity, so mark every spot with chalk or tape for targeted sealing.”\nKey Points:\nFull seal around the frame ensures you measure real leaks.\nLow‑speed pressurization reveals even subtle gaps.\nSmoke direction shows infiltration (smoke pulled in) vs. exfiltration (blown out).\nEach leak sealed equals more amps saved on your generator.\u000b\nLocal example\n“In one Mosul home, sealing a tiny leak at the attic hatch recovered 3 amps—enough to run a fan all night.”\nActivity Instructions:\nTeam A sets up the blower‑door frame and fan.\nTeam B lights a smoke pencil and moves along seams, doors, and windows.\nMark each leak location and note approximate draft strength on your chart.\nRotate roles so everyone practices setup, testing, and marking.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nSmoke disperses too quickly\u000b – Solution: Move the pencil closer to the seam or reduce fan speed.\nFan seal leaks around frame\u000b – Solution: Adjust the gasket or use extra tape to close gaps.\nToo many small leaks\u000b – Solution: Prioritize the largest drafts first—they save the most amps.\nTransition\u000b “Great detection!

For gaps ≤ 3 mm, use acrylic caulk—it sets in 30 minutes and costs about 350 IQD per meter. For 3–8 mm, choose silicone sealant, which cures in 2 hours and handles movement at 650 IQD per meter. For moveable joints, like door frames, install a rubber gasket at 900 IQD per meter. And for larger cracks and seams over 1 mm, use expanding PU foam—it fills irregular spaces in 10 minutes for 1 200 IQD per meter. Pick the right product for each leak to ensure long‑lasting seals.”\n\nKey Points\nPU foam expands to fill large, irregular gaps quickly.\nAcrylic caulk is fast‑setting for very thin cracks.\nSilicone offers flexibility on medium‑sized joints.\nRubber gaskets maintain a seal on moving parts and doors.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nLook at the leaks you marked on your wall diagram and estimate each gap’s width.\nChoose the material from the matrix that matches that gap size.\nRetrieve one sample tube of that product from the materials table for demo.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nFoam overshoots the gap\u000b – Solution: Apply sparingly and trim excess after it cures.\nSilicone vs. acrylic confusion\u000b – Solution: Recall: acrylic sets fast but is rigid; silicone takes longer but remains flexible.\nGasket sizing unsure\u000b – Solution: Press the gasket into the joint—if it compresses snugly, it’s the right profile.\nTransition\u000b “Great—now that you have the correct sealants, let’s turn to airflow and learn about Heritage Stack Ventilation next.”\n\n155\nDiagnostic Process Map\nDay 4\nInspect → Measure → Document → Analyze → \nPrioritize ROI → Report → Quote → Close\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10:35 – 10:40 Diagnostic Process Map (5 min)\nPurpose\u000b Provide a clear roadmap of the client‑consultation workflow—from initial inspection to closing the sale—so teams can follow a consistent, professional process.\nSetup\u000b • Slide full‑screen showing the eight‑step map: Inspect → Measure → Document → Analyze → Prioritize → Report → Quote → Close\u000b • Participants seated and ready to take notes\nMaterials needed\u000b • Slide deck only\n\nPre‑activity checks\nEnsure each step label is visible and in logical order\nConfirm arrows or numbering clearly show the flow\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “We use this Diagnostic Process Map to guide every project from start to finish. First, Inspect the building envelope and equipment. Next, Measure temperatures, amp draws, and leak flows. Then Document your findings in the Diagnostic Checklist and sketches. Analyze the data in your calculator sheets to quantify loads and costs. Prioritize solutions based on impact and budget. Report back to the client with an executive summary highlighting savings and payback. Quote the selected package with transparent pricing. Finally, Close by handling objections and securing commitment. Following these steps ensures you deliver both technical excellence and a smooth client experience.”\n\nKey Points:\nInspect & Measure gather the raw data.\nDocument & Analyze turn observations into numbers.\nPrioritize & Report focus on the highest‑impact fixes.\nQuote & Close tie cost, value, and trust into a signed agreement.\u000b\nLocal example\n“Our Mosul pilot used this exact flow—every customer felt confident because they saw each step, from leak tests to final quote.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\nReview the eight steps on your screen.\nIn one sentence, pick the step you found most challenging yesterday and share with your neighbor.\nNote how you will streamline that step in your own process.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nSkipping steps\u000b – Solution: Emphasize: “No shortcuts—each phase builds on the last.”\nData overload\u000b – Solution: Use the priority step to focus on top three actions only.\nClient confusion\u000b – Solution: Present the map to the client up front to set expectations.\nTransition\u000b “Now that we have our full process in mind, let’s move into hands‑on mode at our Retrofit Stations: Seal → Size → Sketch → Log.”\n\n156\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n\n157\nRetrofit Stations: Seal → Size → Sketch → Log\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nStation 1: Crack-Sealing with PU Foam or Silicone\nStation 2B: Sketch Ventilation options (badgir/courtyard /air vents)\nDay 4\n10 : 40 – 10 : 45 (5 min) Air-Sealing & Vent Station Overview\nPurpose\u000b Orient teams to today’s four‑step hands‑on flow and show where to capture data in the workbook.\nSetup\nSlide projected full‑screen at the lab entrance\nStations clearly numbered: 1 → 2A → 2B → 3\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nSlide deck only\nRotation sheet for each team\u000b\nPre‑activity Checks\nVerify station signs and icons match this slide\nEnsure each team has a rotation sheet\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Here’s our Retrofit Stations workflow and where you’ll record your data:\u000b Station 1: Crack‑Sealing with PU Foam or Silicone (no workbook entry yet).\u000b Station 2A: Vent/Fan Sizing on the mock roof → use Solution Designer → Roof Solutions to tick your vent and enter Coverage %.\u000b Station 2B: Sketch your Heritage Vent on paper (for your portfolio—no workbook entry).\u000b Station 3: Log airflow & ΔT → then open Energy Calculator and set Infiltration U‑Value to zero; capture the updated chart in the “Simple Charts” slot for your portfolio.\nFollow the sequence 1 → 2A → 2B → 3 so your data flows into the correct tabs.”\n\nKey Points\nStation 2A entries go into Solution Designer (Coverage %).\nStation 3 entries and chart come from Energy Calculator.\nStation 2B sketch and Station 1 sealing build your portfolio visuals.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nStart at Station 1 for crack‑sealing.\nRotate every 15 minutes in order: 1 → 2A → 2B → 3.\nCheck off each icon as you finish a station.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nTeams crowd one station: “Timer rings—move to the next station.”\nWorkbook confusion: “Remember 2A uses Solution Designer, 3 uses Energy Calculator.”\u000b\nTransition\n“Let’s head to Station 1 for detailed Crack‑Sealing instructions—see the next slide!”\n\n158\nStation 1: Mastering Crack-Sealing\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🧹 Prep: Clean & dry the crack\n💉 Tool: Select the right material and tool: PU foam or silicone caulk gun\n🖌️ Apply: Fill gap fully & smooth surface\nDay 4\n10 : 45 – 11 : 00 (15 min) Station 1: Crack-Sealing Instructions\nPurpose\u000b Ensure every team seals their diagnosed leaks perfectly to maximize energy savings and prepare for accurate airflow tests.\nSetup\u000b – Slide displayed at Station 1 table.\u000b – Teams gathered around the crack-sealing station.\nMaterials Needed\u000b – PU foam gun and/or silicone caulk gun\u000b – Utility knife for foam trimming\u000b – Cleaning brush or cloth\u000b – Gloves and safety glasses\nPre-activity Checks\u000b – Verify each crack is free of dust and moisture.\u000b – Confirm sealant cartridges are loaded correctly in the guns.\u000b – Ensure work area is ventilated.\nFacilitator Script\n“Welcome to Station 1. First, prep the crack by brushing away dust and ensuring it’s dry. Next, choose your sealant—PU foam for larger gaps or silicone for smaller joints—and load it into your gun. Finally, apply by steadily filling the gap from bottom to top, then smooth the surface with a trowel or gloved finger.”\n\nKey Points\nPrep is critical—contaminants weaken adhesion.\nConsistent bead prevents air pockets and ensures full seal.\nSmooth finish both looks professional and avoids trapping moisture.\u000b\nLocal Example\n“In Mosul homes, teams who skipped proper prep saw foam pull back from the crack; those who cleaned first achieved a complete seal lasting months.”\n\nActivity Instructions\nBrush and dry your marked crack thoroughly.\nLoad your PU foam or silicone into the gun.\nApply sealant steadily—don’t rush the fill.\nSmooth the bead immediately for a flush finish.\nTrim any excess foam after it sets (~10 min for PU foam).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Sealant drips or overflows →\u000b Solution: Reduce trigger pressure and fill slowly.\nIssue: Foam pulls back after curing →\u000b Solution: Reapply a thin silicone bead over the cured foam to lock it in.\nIssue: Skin irritation from foam →\u000b Solution: Wear gloves and wash exposed skin immediately.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great work sealing those leaks!

Choose either a badgir wind-catcher or a courtyard stack vent. On grid paper, sketch a top-down plan and a side profile showing how air flows through your design. Label key dimensions like tower height and inlet area.”\n\nKey Points\nBadgir uses wind and pressure differences—tower height is critical.\nCourtyard vent leverages stack effect—openings at top and bottom drive flow.\nAnnotation of airflow arrows and dimensions ties design to performance.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nPick one heritage vent type (badgir or courtyard).\nOn grid paper, draw the plan view (roof layout) and side view (tower or cavity).\nAdd arrows to show airflow direction and label openings (inlet/outlet).\nNote approximate dimensions (height, inlet width) next to your sketch.\nPrepare to explain your design in two sentences at the chart station.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Overly detailed drawings →\u000b Solution: Keep sketches simple—focus on flow path and key dimensions.\nIssue: Uncertain about airflow direction →\u000b Solution: Refer to smoke test observations: air moves from high‐pressure to low‐pressure zones.\u000b\nTransition\n“Fantastic designs!

Trust Through Evidence\n- Every claim backed by photo, ΔT measurement, or video\n- Second-Floor Comfort Test benchmark: ΔT ≤ 3°C\n- \"Hall of Shame\" examples of poor quality\n\n### 2. Financial Transparency\n- Show actual invoices + markup calculations\n- Multiple payment models (upfront, 30/70, install-first)\n- ROI always under 18 months\n\n### 3. Health & Dignity Framing\n- Not just \"cooler\" but \"healthier families\"\n- 60% fewer respiratory issues\n- \"Use all rooms year-round\"\n\n### 4. Cultural Integration\n- Opening Hadith: \"Best people benefit people\"\n- Heritage ventilation (badgir, courtyard vents)\n- Local materials (Labkh Al Harrari)\n- Mosul-specific climate data\n\n### 5. Ethical Business Practices\n- \"Under-promise, over-deliver\" (Omar's guidance)\n- Quality prevents \"pay twice\" scenarios\n- Career path from technician to consultant\n\n---\n\n## Key Tools & Platforms\n\n### Digital Tools\n1. **AuditMyBeit**: Home audit platform (Day 1)\n2. **Energy Calculator**: ΔT → kWh → IQD conversion (Days 1-5)\n3. **Solution Designer**: Intervention selection & pricing (Days 2-4)\n4. **Quote Generator**: Auto-calculate ROI & payback (Days 2-5)\n5. **Financial Dashboard**: Win-rate, cash-flow tracking (Day 5)\n6. **Canva**: Service card & flyer design (Day 4)\n\n### Physical Tools\n- IR thermometer (temperature measurement)\n- Smoke pencil (leak detection)\n- Blower-door fan (infiltration testing)\n- Mini-roof tiles (coating lab)\n- Plaster samples (mix-ratio practice)\n- PU foam & caulk guns (sealing)\n\n### Materials Database\n- XPS, EPS, Fiberglass, Mineral Wool, Labkh\n- Acrylic, Elastomeric, Silicone coatings\n- Supplier contacts & pricing (Turkey, Jordan, UAE)\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Technical Competency\n- ΔT measurement accuracy: ± 1°C\n- Mix ratio precision: 1:3:0.5\n- Leak detection success rate: 90%+\n- ROI calculation correctness: 100%\n\n### Business Readiness\n- Portfolio completeness: 4/4 days documented\n- Pitch delivery: 5 minutes with live demo\n- Service card quality: professional design\n- 30-day plan specificity: actionable steps\n\n### Customer Trust Indicators\n- Evidence protocol compliance: photo + ΔT + video\n- Transparency: invoice + markup shown\n- Payment flexibility: install-first offered\n- Testimonial authenticity: real homeowner stories\n\n---\n\n## Regional Context: Why Mosul?\n\n### Climate Challenges\n- Summer temps exceed 48°C\n- Extreme desert climate (60-70% desert coverage)\n- Rising temperatures: +1.3°C since 1950s\n- Highest cooling demand: May-September\n\n### Energy Situation\n- Fossil-heavy power (180M tons CO₂/year)\n- High summer electricity consumption: 2,370 kWh/month\n- Households = largest energy consumers\n- Generator dependence (800 IQD/kWh cost)\n\n### Built Environment Issues\n- 4,000-unit disaster: no roof insulation\n- Modern concrete absorbs heat (vs. traditional stone)\n- High Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR >18%)\n- Post-conflict reconstruction needs\n\n### Market Opportunity\n- Classification: 5th most climate-vulnerable country\n- Cooling = 66% of electricity use\n- Retrofit potential: existing building stock\n- Import pathways: Turkey, Jordan, UAE\n\n---\n\n## After-Training Support\n\n### 30-Day Launch Plan\n- **Week 1**: Audit 3 homes, identify pilot candidate\n- **Week 2**: Spec project, present 3 options (Good/Better/Best)\n- **Week 3**: Install with full documentation\n- **Week 4**: Evidence pack, testimonial, plan next 2 projects\n\n### Accountability System\n- Daily photo check-ins (WhatsApp)\n- Weekly group calls\n- Results Database tracking:\n  - Audits conducted\n  - Quotes delivered\n  - Conversion rate\n  - ΔT achieved\n  - Customer satisfaction\n  - Referrals generated\n\n### Career Progression\n- **L1 Auditor** (6-12 months): Conduct audits, basic specs\n- **L2 Consultant** (1-2 years): Full retrofit design, procurement, supervision\n- **Trainer/Lead** (2+ years): Train others, QA, business development\n\n### Services Menu\n1.

Trust Through Evidence\\n- Every claim backed by photo, \\u0394T measurement, or video\\n- Second-Floor Comfort Test benchmark: \\u0394T \\u2264 3\\u00b0C\\n- \\\"Hall of Shame\\\" examples of poor quality\\n\\n### 2. Financial Transparency\\n- Show actual invoices + markup calculations\\n- Multiple payment models (upfront, 30/70, install-first)\\n- ROI always under 18 months\\n\\n### 3. Health & Dignity Framing\\n- Not just \\\"cooler\\\" but \\\"healthier families\\\"\\n- 60% fewer respiratory issues\\n- \\\"Use all rooms year-round\\\"\\n\\n### 4. Cultural Integration\\n- Opening Hadith: \\\"Best people benefit people\\\"\\n- Heritage ventilation (badgir, courtyard vents)\\n- Local materials (Labkh Al Harrari)\\n- Mosul-specific climate data\\n\\n### 5. Ethical Business Practices\\n- \\\"Under-promise, over-deliver\\\" (Omar's guidance)\\n- Quality prevents \\\"pay twice\\\" scenarios\\n- Career path from technician to consultant\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Tools & Platforms\\n\\n### Digital Tools\\n1. **AuditMyBeit**: Home audit platform (Day 1)\\n2. **Energy Calculator**: \\u0394T \\u2192 kWh \\u2192 IQD conversion (Days 1-5)\\n3. **Solution Designer**: Intervention selection & pricing (Days 2-4)\\n4. **Quote Generator**: Auto-calculate ROI & payback (Days 2-5)\\n5. **Financial Dashboard**: Win-rate, cash-flow tracking (Day 5)\\n6. **Canva**: Service card & flyer design (Day 4)\\n\\n### Physical Tools\\n- IR thermometer (temperature measurement)\\n- Smoke pencil (leak detection)\\n- Blower-door fan (infiltration testing)\\n- Mini-roof tiles (coating lab)\\n- Plaster samples (mix-ratio practice)\\n- PU foam & caulk guns (sealing)\\n\\n### Materials Database\\n- XPS, EPS, Fiberglass, Mineral Wool, Labkh\\n- Acrylic, Elastomeric, Silicone coatings\\n- Supplier contacts & pricing (Turkey, Jordan, UAE)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Success Metrics\\n\\n### Technical Competency\\n- \\u0394T measurement accuracy: \\u00b1 1\\u00b0C\\n- Mix ratio precision: 1:3:0.5\\n- Leak detection success rate: 90%+\\n- ROI calculation correctness: 100%\\n\\n### Business Readiness\\n- Portfolio completeness: 4/4 days documented\\n- Pitch delivery: 5 minutes with live demo\\n- Service card quality: professional design\\n- 30-day plan specificity: actionable steps\\n\\n### Customer Trust Indicators\\n- Evidence protocol compliance: photo + \\u0394T + video\\n- Transparency: invoice + markup shown\\n- Payment flexibility: install-first offered\\n- Testimonial authenticity: real homeowner stories\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Regional Context: Why Mosul?\\n\\n### Climate Challenges\\n- Summer temps exceed 48\\u00b0C\\n- Extreme desert climate (60-70% desert coverage)\\n- Rising temperatures: +1.3\\u00b0C since 1950s\\n- Highest cooling demand: May-September\\n\\n### Energy Situation\\n- Fossil-heavy power (180M tons CO\\u2082/year)\\n- High summer electricity consumption: 2,370 kWh/month\\n- Households = largest energy consumers\\n- Generator dependence (800 IQD/kWh cost)\\n\\n### Built Environment Issues\\n- 4,000-unit disaster: no roof insulation\\n- Modern concrete absorbs heat (vs. traditional stone)\\n- High Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR >18%)\\n- Post-conflict reconstruction needs\\n\\n### Market Opportunity\\n- Classification: 5th most climate-vulnerable country\\n- Cooling = 66% of electricity use\\n- Retrofit potential: existing building stock\\n- Import pathways: Turkey, Jordan, UAE\\n\\n---\\n\\n## After-Training Support\\n\\n### 30-Day Launch Plan\\n- **Week 1**: Audit 3 homes, identify pilot candidate\\n- **Week 2**: Spec project, present 3 options (Good/Better/Best)\\n- **Week 3**: Install with full documentation\\n- **Week 4**: Evidence pack, testimonial, plan next 2 projects\\n\\n### Accountability System\\n- Daily photo check-ins (WhatsApp)\\n- Weekly group calls\\n- Results Database tracking:\\n  - Audits conducted\\n  - Quotes delivered\\n  - Conversion rate\\n  - \\u0394T achieved\\n  - Customer satisfaction\\n  - Referrals generated\\n\\n### Career Progression\\n- **L1 Auditor** (6-12 months): Conduct audits, basic specs\\n- **L2 Consultant** (1-2 years): Full retrofit design, procurement, supervision\\n- **Trainer/Lead** (2+ years): Train others, QA, business development\\n\\n### Services Menu\\n1.
