Yeah I just got back from America 5 days ago jet lagged and today I did not take my aderall yet although I don’t want to and I want to feel awake I feel sooooo heavy - foggy low energy and weak. I don’t think it’s just the no aderal I took a green smoothie and I’ll have a coffee - what’s the research on humid acid yesterday",

      "content": " It sounds like you're experiencing extreme fatigue and wondering if it's related to taking humic acid yesterday. This could be a complex situation with multiple factors:\n\nThe fatigue you're describing could be influenced by several factors working together:\n\n1. Jet lag - You returned from America just 5 days ago, and transoceanic travel can disrupt sleep cycles for 7-10 days\n2. Medication pause - Not taking your prescribed Adderall today\n3. Humic acid - Potential effects from yesterday's dose\n\nRegarding humic acid specifically, there's limited clinical research on its effects in humans. Humic acid is a complex mixture of many different molecules formed during the decomposition of plant matter. Some observations about humic acid:\n\n- It can bind to minerals and other substances in your body, potentially affecting absorption\n- Some people report fatigue after taking it, though this isn't well-documented in scientific literature\n- The 2 gram dose you took is relatively large compared to typical supplement doses\n\nYour body is likely dealing with multiple stressors at once: jet lag disrupting your circadian rhythm, the absence of your usual medication, and potentially some effect from the humic acid.\n\nA reasonable approach might be to:\n- Ensure proper hydration\n- Get natural sunlight to help reset your circadian rhythm\n- Consider reducing humic acid dosage or taking a break if you suspect it's contributing to fatigue\n- Consult with your doctor about medication timing and jet lag management\n\nWould you mind sharing what led you to take humic acid in the first place? That might help provide more context for your situation.",
