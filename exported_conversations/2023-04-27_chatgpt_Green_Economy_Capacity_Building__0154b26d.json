      "content": "Summarize the following as if I'm in high school be specific about the tasks needed to do:\n1.1.1. Fill in the table below:\nObiectives of the action\nTarget group(s)6\nFinal beneficiaries\"\nExpected outputs\nMain activities\nOverall objective: To strengthen and promote the green and circular economy as a vector for job creation and expansion of economic opportunities, leading to a more sustainable economy in Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, and Tunisia.\nSpecific objective: To increase green and circular economy competences of business support organisations (BSOs) and their capacity to act as ecosystem enablers bridging the gap between policy (macro) and SME (micro) levels.\nBusiness Support Organisations (such as incubators and accelerators, hubs, but also chambers of commerce, foundations and NGOs focused on job creation and entrepreneurship for vulnerable groups, sector-specific business associations, etc.)\nN.B. In Reway we define as ecosystem partners the BSOs that are members of the consortium, while we define BSOs the other BSOs that are not applicants in this proposal.\n(M)SMESs, Startup entrepreneurs,\nNational and Local\nPolicymakers, Academics, consumers and citizens of the wider MENA region.\nEO1 - (Develop) - A set of key resources targeting BSOs - and serving the purpose of understanding the 7 target MENA markets and of developing fitting and contextually relevant materials on green and circular economy - are created by the partners to be used in training and capacity building activities.\nE02: (Train) - 42 BSOs + 10 Ecosystem partners in 7 MENA countries, master key methodologies and approaches to drive startup and SME sectors in their countries towards circularity and sustainable production & consumption.\nE03: (Expand) - 1 Ecosystem Shapers Network of BSOs committed to becoming the major drivers of an economic shift towards circularity, sustainability and positive impact in their economies is created, bridging the MENA and European regions.\nE01\nA1.1 Data Architecture analysis and creation of online\n\"resource bank\" - The partners will take stock of their existing online platforms as well as other options available to create a common online open source space that will become the main go-to-place (one stop shop for all the resources and learning materials created used/identified during the project by the partners and by the newly-created Ecosystem Shapers Network (A3.1).\nA1.2 Green & Circular sectoral assessment - A sectoral mapping and assessment of the most relevant national SME sectors in relational to their ability (or lack of) to embrace and adopt green/social and circular practices, the main obstacles they encounter and what would most help them in this transition, will be conducted in the 7 MENA countries, each led by the Ecosystem Partners.\nA.1.3 Contextualisation, Translation and Training of Trainers on Embedding Circularity Toolkit - Based on IH's existing resource, the Ecosystem Partners will receive a ToT that will enable them to train other BSOs, including the ones that will be chosen to take part in Reway (A1.3), to embed circularity principles and practices into the startups they support. The toolkit and accompanying Teachable training materials will be first translated into Arabic and French, and enriched with examples and stories from the MENA region, drawn from the data emerging from the sectoral assessment, which will also form the basis of much of the follow-on communication-related activities (A2.6).\nA1.4 Identification and diagnostic assessment of 42 BSOs in target countries\nThe Ecosystem Partners will each select and invite 6 BSOs (on average, some Partners may suggest more/less depending on the size of their country and state of development of their ecosystem) to take part in various ReWay activities. The selection criteria will ensure a wide and diversified pool of BSOs, in recognition of the importance of reaching all elements of the SME sector. A diagnostic assessment of the BSOs' basic competences and skills in supporting entrepreneurs and SMEs will be conducted, with the aim of bringing everyone up to speed on the core elements of business support. The assessment will also map key tech and digital competences, as well as impact measurement/management approaches and communication capabilities.\nA1.5 Drafting and validation of Embedding Green/Social Toolkit - Conceptualised as a twin to the Embedding Circularity Toolkit (A1.3), with a freely-downloadable guide and associated online training and set of audio-visual resources, and targeting BSOs that work with early-stage enterprises and startups, the GS Toolkit will be first drafted by a purposely-created working group of BSOs from across Europe and the MENA regions that will draw from their lived experience the key learnings. A first draft of the toolkit will be then tested by at least 10 traditional BSOs and validated, and any changes embedded into the final draft of the Toolkit.\nA1.6 Creation of sectoral green/social and circularity packages\n(5)\nBased on the in-country findings of the assessment (A1.2), which will have brought to the fore the critical factors that may aid or hinder the transition of specific economic sector into circularity and sustainable production and consumption, the Ecosystem Partners will select 1 priority sector each and create a highly-practical package of tools and resources that will help other BSOs like them drive SMEs from that sector into becoming fully sustainable. The package will thus be structured as a 3-stage journey. The first part (do-no-harm) will offer a basic set of tools and recommendations. The second part (do-good) will tailor to a more motivated and principled crowd, enabling the participating SMEs to go fully circular, sustainable and socially responsible.\nThe third and final part will focus on offering targeted SMEs the option of embedding systemic-change approaches into their operations, thus lifting them above all others into a position of drivers of the transformation of the economic sector they operate in. Depending on the chosen sectors, the Ecosystem partners may well be working in close collaboration with one another, and with a pool of other BSOs that will be part of the Ecosystem Shapers Network and with experience in supporting SMEs and who will offer advice, resources and suggestions. Each resulting package will be validated (A.2.5) before being finalised and published in English, Arabic and French as a set covering multiple sectors in the MENA region (and beyond).\nE02\nA2.1 Capacity building of the 42 selected BSOs\nOnce the diagnostic assessment (A1.4) has been completed, the BSOs and in some cases the Ecosystem Partners who will find it useful) will undergo a number of capacity building and training modules to ensure they fully master some key competences in line with the action's themes. These will include for example training on environmental and social impact measurement and management, certification training (on the main international standards relevant to the region, including ESG, BCorp and SEMark) and training on how to communicate sustainability. All materials related to these trainings are to be developed in Arabic, English and French.\nA2.2 ToT for the Embedding Green/Social Toolkit\nOnce the validation phase of the Embedding GS Toolkit is completed (Al.S, a final version will be published and the accompanying audiovisual training will be recorded in Arabic, English and French, and distributed to all Ecosystem Partners, who will then receive a similar training of trainers to the Embedding Circularity Toolkit.\nA2.3. Organisation of Study tours and buddy-system for BSOs During the preparation of the sectoral green and circularity package of support for SMEs, the Ecosystem partners will have worked closely with some BSOs from Europe with expertise in supporting SMEs transition to circularity and sustainability. The study tours will be a way for the Ecosystem Partners and a number of committed B$Os from the MENA region to get inspired and learn directly from a peer BSO in Europe expert in these disciplines. By developing a closer tie between MENA BSOs and their counterparts in Europe, Reway will ensure a successful and consistent knowledge transfer through the establishment of a buddy-system (in our case a sister-to-sister system) that will also be used in the \"Pair for Greening and Circularity\" methodology (A2.4). For the Ecosystem partners, these study tours will happen twice, and once they will receive their sister BSO, for a total of 3 exchanges. For the BSOs, the Study tours will happen once, and for all involved it will be an immersive and inspirational",

The methodology has been tailored to the need of this program by pairing BSOs in the MENA region with European BSOs and with an expert coach. The expert and the European BSOs will support the MENA BSOs in developing their portfolio of services and their plan for including support activities focusing on circularity and sustainability. The expert will facilitate the talks among the two BSOs, providing inputs and knowledge to facilitate a co-designing process with two BSOs, activating a peering learning path. This triangular collaboration will last 4 months and at the end of it the 42 MENA B$Os will know which services in the field of circularity and sustainability they want to develop, why and how.\nA2.5. Scouting and identification of SMEs to receive training in green circularity transition\nThe sectoral green/social and circularity packages will be first validated by each Ecosystem partner with a cohort of sector-specific SMEs, scouted and identified in their context.\nThese SMEs will be able to offer suggestions and feedback on the package, which will then be enriched and completed with the live experience of the first cohort of participants. A second cohort will be identified after the finalisation of the package of materials, accelerating the positioning of each Ecosystem Partner as key service provider to SME transition.\nA2.6 Official launch of the green/social and circularity package for SMEs and communication campaign\nThe launch of the final version of the green/social & circularity package will use an innovative communication approach with various interventions jointly building a holistic project: I\n1) 20-30 minutes video documentary to communicate the 'why and how of circularity and sustainable production and consumption with examples from around the MENA region tailored to MSMEs and compelling messaging;\n2) interactive platform, linked to the documentary for a deeper dive into practical resources to support action-taking;\n3) trans-MENA & locally adapted online communication campaign to attract the SMEs to the documentary & website;\nThe launch will activate a movement of enterprises to open up for radical change by activating MENA SMEs to take steps to reduce carbon emissions, embrace green/social values and go circular and encourage their peers to do the same. We aim to reach 50.000+ SMEs in MENA through (assuming some through various channels:\nDocumentary screening online: 10.000,\nInteractive Website visit: 20.000, Ecosystem partners channels: 15.000\nLocal Activation Events & Conferences: 5.000\nLeading to 2.500 SMEs committing to circularity and the topic being established within the sector.\nA2.7. Organisation of one Regional Capacity building\nBootcamp\nIn year 2 a capacity building bootcamp will be organised to offer an international learning space to the 40 BSOs that wi Marina Sarli aspects emerged during the first year of implementation.\nEO3\nA3.1 Establishment of BSO Ecosystem Shapers Network\nOnce the data architecture and online repository of resources is established, the partners will officially launch the BSO Ecosystem Shapers Network. Creation of a one stop shop for circular, social and green economy linked to the network where we can share learning materials, share pool of circular and green experts, space for joint initiatives, forum for access to funds, etc.\nA3.2 Organisation of 2 regional policy (1) and ecosystem development (2) workshops\nThe 2 Workshops will kickstart two distinct strands of work aiming to reinforce the role of the Ecosystem partners as key actors vis-a-vis the policy world and in relation to accelerating the development of resilient green/social entrepreneurship ecosystems, with the ultimate aim of shifting the local economies towards circularity and sustainable production and consumption.\nDuring the Bootcamps, the Ecosystem partners will be able to share perspectives and learn from each other, as well as to receive technical support by consortium partners who are experts in these fields. The Bootcamps will also serve as an opportunity for cross-pollination of activities and strategies across the region and to allow for closer collaboration and synergies between the partners.\nA.3.3 Multi-stakeholders Policy Dialogues: on the back of the first Bootcamp, the partners in collaboration with the trained BSOs will initiate a series of policy initiatives to engage public authorities (local or governmental levels), academia and investors and discuss and advance on the produced recommendation.\nA3.4. Accompaniment of Ecosystem Partners in the mapping and subsequent development of a strategy to strengthen their ecosystem for green/social entrepreneurship\nTo accelerate the advancement of a green and social enterprise ecosystem in each of the 7 target countries, a range of system levers can be pulled at the ecosystem level. These include increasing flows of finance, building networks, strengthening markets, further building knowledge across various stakeholders, shaping policy and building powerful narratives. Ecosystem Partners will receive training and support to map the current state of their ecosystem and to shape a systemic strategy to play a critical role in accelerating its future development.
