ITC\nis 100% &quot;Aid for Trade&quot;, supporting trade that delivers inclusive and sustainable\ndevelopment results. ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and transition\neconomies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs),\nLandlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs)\nFragile States and Sub-Saharan Africa. To support a more inclusive distribution of\ndevelopment gains, ITC works with women, youth, and marginalized groups in\ndeveloping countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that\nprovide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation.\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq,\nimplemented by UN-Habitat, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the\nInternational Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent work and affordable housing.\nThis multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive\ninvestment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq&#39;s National Public Works\nProgramme, enhancing capacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting\ntrade-led private sector engagement in climate smart construction, and empowering\nsocial partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these components, BEIT\nfocuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools\nand legislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social\ndialogue and capacity building among social partners, all to address housing\nchallenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating climate change impacts\nin the housing sector.\nOutput 3.3 of the project is designed to enhance the capabilities of local businesses,\nparticularly focusing on young entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative\npractices into their operations.

      "content": "Let’s break this down step by step by analyzing each task in terms of what’s required and estimating how long it might take. I’ll also ask questions where needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 1: Stakeholder Engagement (April 15 - May 15)**\n#### **Tasks:**\n1. Conduct focus group discussions with key stakeholders.\n2. Identify and document partners and their roles.\n3. Summarize feedback and recommendations for curriculum validation and certification.\n\n#### **Time Estimate Breakdown:**\n- **Planning (3-5 days):** Identifying stakeholders, setting up interviews/focus groups, designing questions.\n- **Conducting discussions (5-7 days):** Hosting multiple focus groups (assuming 4-6 discussions with different groups).\n- **Analysis and reporting (7-8 days):** Summarizing findings, structuring recommendations.\n\n✅ **Estimated total: ~15-20 days**\n\n**Questions for you:**\n- How many stakeholders do you anticipate engaging? (More stakeholders = more time for discussions)\n- Will you need translation support for Arabic speakers, or do you handle that yourself? (Translation may add 1-2 extra days)\n- Do you already have a list of partners, or will you need to identify them from scratch? (If from scratch, add a few extra days)\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Curriculum Design and Improvement (May 15 - July 15)**\n#### **Tasks:**\n1. Revise and improve the curriculum based on stakeholder feedback.\n2. Develop additional teaching aids and trainer resources.\n3. Finalize a training delivery strategy and ensure accessibility.\n\n#### **Time Estimate Breakdown:**\n- **Reviewing stakeholder input and revising the curriculum (5-7 days)**\n- **Creating facilitator guides, case studies, and exercises (10-15 days)** \n- **Developing multimedia resources (5-7 days)**\n- **Finalizing curriculum translation and formatting (5-7 days)** \n\n✅ **Estimated total: ~25-30 days**\n\n**Questions for you:**\n- Do you already have drafts of teaching materials, or will they need to be created from scratch?\n- How complex will the multimedia resources be? (Basic slides and handouts take less time than video content)\n- Will you need to consult subject matter experts for technical content? (This could add extra time)\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Training of Trainers (ToT) & Capacity Building (July 15 - Sept 15)**\n#### **Tasks:**\n1. Conduct Training of Trainers (ToT) sessions.\n2. Develop an implementation framework for internships/apprenticeships.\n3. Provide recommendations for sustainability.\n\n#### **Time Estimate Breakdown:**\n- **Preparing ToT materials and session agenda (5-7 days)**\n- **Delivering ToT sessions (6-8 days)** (assuming multiple training sessions)\n- **Developing the internship/job shadowing framework (5-7 days)**\n- **Writing a sustainability plan (4-6 days)**\n\n✅ **Estimated total: ~20-25 days**\n\n**Questions for you:**\n- Will the ToT sessions be in-person or virtual? (Travel could extend the timeline)\n- How many trainers are expected to participate? (Larger groups may require multiple sessions)\n- Are internship/apprenticeship partnerships already in place, or do you need to initiate them? (Finding new partners can add time)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimate:**\nAdding up all the estimates:\n- **Stakeholder Engagement:** 15-20 days\n- **Curriculum Development:** 25-30 days\n- **Training of Trainers & Sustainability Work:** 20-25 days\n\n✅ **Total estimated workdays: 60-75 days over 5 months.**\n\n---\n\n### **Key Considerations**\n- **If you work full-time (5 days/week), this is roughly 3-4 months of effort.**\n- **If part-time (e.g., 3 days/week), it could stretch closer to 5 months.**\n- **Potential bottlenecks:** Scheduling stakeholders, waiting on approvals, delays in gathering feedback.\n- **Ways to speed up:** Parallel processing (e.g., refining curriculum while engaging stakeholders), delegating tasks.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a more detailed week-by-week plan to organize your work? Also, do you foresee any major challenges that might shift these timelines?",
