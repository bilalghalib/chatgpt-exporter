      "content": "The idea that one must make amends with others before asking Allah for forgiveness is not a single hadith, but rather a consistent teaching across various authentic narrations and Islamic legal and ethical thought. Here's the closest relevant hadith and supporting teachings:\n\n### 1. **Rights of People vs. Rights of Allah**\nThe Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:\n\n> **\"Do you know who the bankrupt is?\"**  \n> They said, \"The bankrupt among us is the one who has neither money nor goods.\"  \n> He said, **\"The bankrupt of my nation is the one who comes on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting, and zakah, but he comes having abused this one, falsely accused that one, unlawfully consumed the wealth of another, shed the blood of this one, and beaten that one. So he is seated, and this one is given from his good deeds, and that one is given from his good deeds. If his good deeds are exhausted before what he owes is paid off, their sins are taken and cast upon him, and then he is thrown into the Fire.\"**\n\n— **Sahih Muslim, 2581**\n\nThis hadith emphasizes that **violations of others’ rights (huquq al-‘ibad)** must be dealt with **by making amends or compensating the wronged person**, not merely by seeking forgiveness from Allah.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **General Rule: Forgiveness Requires Restitution**\nScholars derive from various narrations that:\n- **If your sin involves a direct offense against another person (e.g., slander, theft, backbiting), you must correct the harm**—either by returning stolen property, apologizing, or otherwise compensating them—**before Allah’s forgiveness can be hoped for.**\n- For sins solely between you and Allah (e.g., missing a prayer), sincere repentance (tawbah) with its conditions—**regret, stopping the sin, and resolve not to return**—is sufficient.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Supporting Narration for Returning Trusts**\n> **\"Render back the trusts to those to whom they are due...\"**  \n— **Qur’an, Surah An-Nisa (4:58)**\n\n> **\"There is no faith for the one who is not trustworthy, and no religion for the one who does not keep his promises.\"**  \n— **Musnad Ahmad, 12565; Hasan**\n\n---\n\nIf you're looking for a specific case—like **backbiting**—there are scholarly debates on whether to inform the person or just seek forgiveness indirectly and make dua for them. But in general, **the moral and legal principle is clear: forgiveness from Allah for interpersonal harm is contingent on making amends.**\n\nWould you like a short dua or phrasing you could use when trying to make amends with someone?",

      "content": "Yes — the concept you're referring to is **the classical definition of tawba (repentance)** in Islamic theology and law. It's not based on a single hadith alone, but on **a consensus of scholars derived from multiple Qur'anic verses and hadith**. The four conditions of *sincere tawba* are widely accepted, especially in the works of scholars like **Imam An-Nawawi**, **Al-Ghazali**, and others.\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 The Four Conditions of Tawba\n\n1. **Stop the sin immediately**  \n   You must halt the behavior and not continue committing the wrongdoing.\n\n2. **Feel sincere regret** (*nadam*)  \n   You must feel true sorrow and remorse for having disobeyed Allah.\n\n3. **Resolve never to return to it**  \n   A firm inner commitment to not repeat the sin.\n\n4. **If the sin involves another person, restore their right or seek their forgiveness**  \n   This is **the key part you're referencing** — if someone has been wronged, *you must right the wrong*.  \n   - Stolen money? Return it.  \n   - Backbiting? Either seek their forgiveness or counteract the harm (scholars differ on best approach).  \n   - Broken trust? Apologize and make amends.\n\n> **Ibn al-Qayyim** said:  \n> > *\"Tawba is not valid unless the harm done to others is rectified, as the rights of people are not waived simply by regret or intention.”*  \n> — *Madarij as-Salikin*\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 Supporting Hadith\n\nWhile not listing all four steps directly, the Prophet ﷺ said:\n\n> **\"Remorse is repentance.\"**  \n> — *Ibn Majah, Hasan (graded by Nawawi)*\n\nAnd the Qur’an says:\n\n> **“Except for those who repent, correct themselves, and make evident [what they concealed]. I will accept their repentance.”**  \n> — *Surah Al-Baqarah (2:160)*\n\nHere, repentance (*tawba*) is **paired with correction of behavior** — *islah* — implying **rectification is essential**, not just intention.\n\n---\n\nSo yes, in Islam:  \n> 💡 **True repentance = Stop + Regret + Intend not to return + Right the wrong (if it involved another person).**\n\nWould you like a short reminder or visual summary of these steps for a workshop or personal use?",
