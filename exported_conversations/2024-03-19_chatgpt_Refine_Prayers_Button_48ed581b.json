I have an app that makes an average guess for all the prayers someone missed in their life and then there's a button i was thinking about calling \"get specific\" or \"specify prayers\" i want 7 different names that imply that they can click this button to get a more granular view of all the prayers they missed so instead of 50 percent for all prayers you can say for morning prayer on average i prayed only 20 percent but in midday i prayed 80 percent because i was at school and we all prayed together\nwhat should that button be called?
