      "content": "Below are **10 precise, high-leverage questions**. They draw on your long history, your ways of being, your hosting/facilitation style, and what UNICEF’s ToR expects. These questions will let me craft a **deeply aligned, coherent application** that sounds like you, not generic L&D language.\n\nI’m keeping them direct and easy to answer one-by-one on your phone.\n\n---\n\n# 10 Questions\n\n**1. When you host or facilitate (rounds of conversation, workshops, peer-cohorts), what are the *two or three non-negotiable principles* you always hold?**  \n(For example: psychological safety, simplicity, shared ownership, delight, slowing down urgency, etc.)\n\n**2. What is your signature way of helping people feel safe, energized, and open—especially in multicultural or high-stakes environments?**  \n(This will let me articulate your “way of being” as a facilitator.)\n\n**3. Looking at UNICEF’s three learning domains (technical, soft skills, management), where do you personally feel strongest, and where do you bring an approach that is *different* from typical L&D consultants?**\n\n**4. What is an example of a moment where your approach changed a team’s behavior—not just their understanding?**  \n(UNICEF wants evidence of behavior change, not just workshops.)\n\n**5. When you design a learning system, what do you do in the first 2–3 weeks that usually unlocks clarity for the team?**  \n(e.g., structured interviews, asset mapping, identifying tensions, surfacing working rhythms, using prototypes instead of long documents.)\n\n**6. What makes your learning design “lightweight but deep”?**  \n(You often combine structure + humanity + reflective depth—how would you describe this in your own words?)\n\n**7. UNICEF emphasizes “rounds of conversation” and informal learning. What do you see as the purpose of these rounds?**  \n(Community building? Meaning-making? Surfacing tacit knowledge? Noticing emerging needs?)\n\n**8. You’ve built platforms, cohorts, workshops, assessments, learning pathways. For this role, what *kind of learning experience* would you be proud to build?**\n\n**9. What motivates you personally about working with UNICEF’s Office of Innovation right now?**  \n(This helps craft an authentic, non-generic motivation statement.)\n\n**10. Is there anything from your personal/philosophical work—Come Alive, attentional principles, beauty as a guide, learning as meaning-making—that you *want* included explicitly, or should the application stay strictly professional and implicit?**\n\n---\n\nWhen you answer these, even briefly, I’ll synthesize:\n\n- a sharper, more grounded cover letter  \n- an updated technical proposal tailored to your actual voice and methods  \n- a positioning narrative that connects your deep theory with UNICEF’s needs  \n- optional revisions to the financial proposal for coherence  \n\nAnswer in whatever format is easiest—short lines or voice-dictation style is fine.",

      "content": "Understood. I’ll extract what’s already here and ask you **targeted micro-questions** so we can fully shape your narrative.\n\nBelow I rewrite your four answers in clean, consultant-ready form, then ask **one clarifying question per answer** to complete each piece.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Your core principles  \n**You said:**  \nagency, community, ubuntu, humanity, craft, strengths-based approach.\n\n**Refined articulation:**  \nYou design learning spaces rooted in **agency**, **community**, and **ubuntu**—where people recognize their interdependence and capacity to uplift each other. You emphasize **humanity and craft**, treating learning as something people *practice* together rather than consume. You use a **strengths-based approach**, helping teams act from what they already do well instead of from deficit.\n\n**Clarifying question (choose one sentence):**  \n**1A.** When these principles are in tension—e.g., urgency vs. agency, or organizational pressure vs. humanity—*what do you do in the room* to restore alignment?\n\n---\n\n## 2. How you help people feel safe and energized  \n**You said:**  \ncheck-ins and creative vulnerability.\n\n**Refined articulation:**  \nYou create psychological safety through **simple check-ins** that slow the pace and let people land as humans, followed by **creative vulnerability**—light, playful opening moves that lower defenses and soften hierarchies (e.g., metaphor prompts, identity objects, small pair exchanges). This brings teams into a shared emotional field where learning feels possible.\n\n**Clarifying question:**  \n**2A.** What is one example of a check-in or “creative vulnerability” practice you’ve used that consistently shifts a room’s energy?\n\n---\n\n## 3. Your strongest learning domains  \n**You said:**  \nsoft skills and technical; and you believe the community focus + connection to “why” is what helps people navigate the technical.\n\n**Refined articulation:**  \nYou have credibility in both **technical learning** (AI, tools, innovation craft) and **soft-skills learning** (psychological safety, leadership, meaning-making). What differentiates you is how you **connect the technical to the “why”**—using community and purpose to make technical learning relevant, grounded, and emotionally coherent. You help people not only *learn tools* but **navigate complexity together**.\n\n**Clarifying question:**  \n**3A.** When you teach technical content (e.g., AI), what is the specific move you make to connect it back to meaning and community?\n\n---\n\n## 4. Example of behavior change  \n**You said:**  \na Type A person came in dubious about your work.\n\n**Refined articulation (draft):**  \nSomeone walked into your program with a strongly Type-A, skeptical stance—questioning the value of reflective or community-driven work. Through the structure you created (agency, community, small wins, vulnerability), something shifted that changed their behavior.\n\nTo make this strong for UNICEF, I need the details.\n\n**Clarifying question:**  \n**4A.** What *exactly* changed for that Type-A participant?  \nFor example:  \n– Did they start collaborating more?  \n– Did they open up in a check-in?  \n– Did they shift from individual to collective framing?  \n– Did they become an advocate for the process?  \n\nA concise description here becomes one of your anchor stories in the proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Please answer 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A in simple short sentences.  \nThat will give me enough to write a fully aligned, high-impact application.",

Let me start by looking back through our history.\n\n\n2 steps\n\nRelevant chats\n8 results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesized facilitation philosophy and prepared targeted inquiry strategy.\n\n\n\nLet me now review your specific proposal documents to understand what you've already created.\n\n\nViewing uploaded files to understand the UNICEF proposal materials\n\n\nSynthesized Bilal's philosophy and crafted targeted strengthening questions.\n12s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on reviewing both our extensive conversation history and your proposal materials, I can see your facilitation DNA clearly: trauma-informed design, \"One Thing Per Day\" pedagogy, Learn-Apply-Share loops, practical over theoretical, and community touchpoints over one-off events. Your proposal is solid but could be stronger in showing how your specific approaches address UNICEF's transition period challenges.\n\nHere are 10 questions to help me strengthen your application with content that's authentically yours:\n\n1. Transition Period Management\nUNICEF emphasizes this is a \"critical transition period.\" You've worked through Lebanon's compound crises and post-conflict reconstruction in Iraq. What specific facilitation techniques do you use when teams are navigating uncertainty or organizational change? Give me a concrete example of how you've helped a team stay psychologically safe while building new capabilities during turbulent times.\n\n2. The \"Rounds of Conversation\" Format\nThey want brown bag lunch-style sessions. You've facilitated extensively—what's your philosophy on creating these informal learning spaces? How do you structure them so they're not just nice chats but actually move learning forward? What's a specific format you've used that worked well?\n\n3. AI Learning Integration\nThey have AI learning survey results to integrate. You built Cursive with the philosophy of \"paper for plural minds\" and ethical AI with manual fallbacks. How would you approach helping a team learn AI tools while maintaining human agency and avoiding the \"black box\" problem? What's your stance on AI upskilling for practitioners?\n\n4. Management/Middle-Management Development\nThe ToR emphasizes management development for people leading teams through complexity. You've trained 350+ mentors and built learning systems at Bloom. What does good management learning look like to you? How do you help people develop management skills without defaulting to corporate platitudes?\n\n5. Measuring What Matters\nYour Iraq work measured behavior change and practice adoption, not just attendance. For UNICEF's Learning Committee, what 6-8 KPIs would you actually recommend tracking? What's the simplest dashboard that would tell them if learning is working?\n\n6. Repository Design Philosophy\nYou emphasize \"three clicks to find anything.\" UNICEF needs a resource repository. What's your philosophy on organizing learning resources so busy people actually use them? How do you balance comprehensiveness with discoverability?\n\n7. Cross-Cultural Facilitation\nYou facilitate in Arabic, worked across 16 countries, and bridge traditional wisdom with modern practice. UNICEF's Office of Innovation is multicultural. How do you facilitate learning when people have very different cultural references and working styles? Give me an example of when you've navigated this well.\n\n8. The \"Lightweight Governance\" Model\nYour proposal mentions a 30-minute monthly Learning Committee cadence. Why 30 minutes? What's your experience with learning governance that actually works vs. governance that becomes another meeting to dread? What makes a Learning Committee effective?\n\n9. Sustainability After You Leave\nYou built sustainability into the Iraq training from day one (Climate Space gatherings, trainer cascades, government advocacy). For UNICEF, how do you design the engagement so the learning culture continues after June 2026? What are the warning signs that it won't sustain, and how do you address them early?\n\n10. Your \"Why\" for This Work\nYou've worked in conflict zones, with displaced communities, training entrepreneurs through crises. UNICEF's Office of Innovation works on global child-focused challenges. Why does this opportunity matter to you? What draws you to helping this team specifically? (This is for your authentic motivation, not the cover letter version.)\n\nOnce you answer these, I'll help weave them into your proposal in ways that make your unique approach unmistakable—and make it clear why you're not just qualified, but the right fit for this specific context.\n\nAlright. So let's think about this. Critical transition period. Yeah. So in a transition period, there are a lot of anxiety about what's to come. And relevance and it's really important 2 Create a sense of grounding in each other and our humanity. In our values, and keep a sense of humor about us. And to realize that these are tools. And not to anthropomorphize so much. And to remember that we're here to learn and to grow and to Really leverage what we can while maintaining our values about who we are and what we want to be. So Some of the best ways I know of to keep our cells psychologically Safe. Is to maintain a check-in practice. For our teams to talk about both both Personally and professionally, what's going on to create Places where there can be 1 on 1 conversations. Dyads, triads, and then group conversations. Where people can see each other and hear each other and be mirrors for each other. Before bringing up the potential difficult conversations that they had in the 1 on 1 areas with a larger group. So that's really important. Round bag lunch style sessions. Yeah. That sounds awesome. I I love it. So making it chill, making it fun, making it Interactive Not sure if we can actually do it while people are eating because I definitely like interactivity. And so structuring them, they're nice nice chats. Move learning forward. Yeah. So Really, This sounds like it really should be a check-in moment where they talk about the explorations that week. Everyone is Probably likely exploring and using large language models, especially at a place like UNICEF where the question of, like, what does AI mean for the future of learning so huge and so paramount. So imagine a lot of people are using it. And think we need to uncover the wisdom of the crowd here. And to make it more of an moment of sharing. And then I think having some kind of common repository of Ideas and best practices and a library could be great. And, yeah. I think whatever we do we need to maintain humanity. At all costs, at at all levels. And have this be something that they have internalized. To really Share and experience the difference between knowledge information, and wisdom. And yeah, you know, HIVT can tell you something that sounds good, and sounds true, but can you repeat it tomorrow? Is it yours? And so I think that might be a really interesting thing is What if the moments that we share were actually more sticky note then Retrieval augmented generation. And to maintain that moment of humanity, gathering the stuff and then putting it into a rag or a another system. To maintain and to collect the information. And that's actually something that I can do is I can take our conversations and use them to create a searchable library. Not sure if that's important AI integration. So Yeah. Learning survey. I'm curious what the survey has. Yeah. I think it would be really interesting to talk about the difference between AI as a tool and AI as an assistant. AI as an assistant makes it really blurry and confusing and actually potentially Got it. Is a part of what is creating the brain rot and some of the other negative, attributes that have come out from the MIT research on essay writing assisted by LLMs. And If we can have a conversation About what this tool is what its architecture is. What it means, really? What people have access to And then we can try to to have a discussion about the affordances to the different tools that it could possibly be just because this base model has a system prompt. That is currently designed to take your workload off of your back because that's kind of the Silicon Valley narrative the question has what can we use it for that is different? That is a convivial technology. How do we transfer this highly fungible and flexible thing into a convivial technology that promotes agency and learning. And I'd love to host that conversation. I have some strategies and some approaches, But definitely would love to think and grow with people at UNICEF about that. Yeah. Management and middle management. Management for people leading teams through complexity. Yeah. I imagine that people are worried about their jobs, and people are worried about What all of this means and managers need to find a way of navigating that and also navigating the quality of work and helping people really feel proud of what they're doing. And I think working with management and middle management To help them understand what to help them connect and promote these qualities and competencies within their teammates, within their subordinates to really feel rather than they're there because they're getting good workout. They're there. It's sort of like they say, don't praise kids for their accomplishments. Praise them for their efforts. It's gonna become even more important now. As people's focus on the outputs of the LLM is going to be larger than the focus on who they're becoming, how their thinking is evolving, their inner exploration and it's okay to use the tool. In the end. But when we talk to middle management, about who the person is because becoming, what they are learning, the questions that they're having, the explorations that they've made, the experiments that they've done. Then there's a different conversation than did you or did you not use an LLM here 4 You know, we we yeah. And and to focus on a mutual exciting thing which is accomplishment and a sense of pride and, team, connection. So 6 to 8 KPIs actually recommend tracking. Is that really are they asking for, KPIs? Can you give me some ideas here? I don't have a lot of time to finish the rest. Repository design philosophy, Yeah. Resource repository. So I think having a Airtable with something that's really easy for people to fill or a Google Form that collects their favorite prompts, their different experiments, questions, anonymous and public, as well as a rag from the conversations that we've had. And I'd actually like to really interview people that are, open for it, both from middle management and others about their interest and questions and to create some some ideas, from that that we can extract. Cross cultural facilitation, yeah I’m not sure what the light to completely change everything yeah and the learning culture I think is really important to kick off and I’m not sure how it fits into their regular sessions, but I’d like to look at what they suggested like what is this brown bag thing and how we can actually dig in to it and find either existing tubing or processes and connect to a more ref this lot, this opportunity matters to me a lot because I believe that humans are beautiful and collaborative and creative and connected to deep wisdom and inspiration and embodied knowledge, and as large language models are coming at a moment of great anxiety I’m worried that people will be leveraging them more to show up as shadows of themselves at work, just regurgitating the past versus tapping into their own creative inspired output, and that this is potentially of what prevents our common creative humanity, and learning and doing together evolving it will become a block. I’m sure there’s other questions. Feel free to take another round.\n\nShow less\n\nSynthesized Bilal's philosophy and identified gaps for deeper exploration.\n17s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is excellent—I can hear your authentic voice and philosophy clearly. Let me push back and probe on a few things, then ask follow-ups.\n\nWhat's Strong and Clear:\nYour psychological safety approach (check-ins, dyads→triads→group) is concrete and practical. That's exactly what a team in transition needs.\n\n\"Sticky notes before RAG\" is brilliant—it's the human curation principle that keeps learning embodied. The distinction between AI-as-tool vs AI-as-assistant is sharp and addresses a real problem (MIT research on brain rot).\n\nYour \"why\" is compelling and cuts to the actual stakes: people showing up as \"shadows of themselves\" vs. accessing their creative humanity. That's what makes this more than just skills training.\n\nWhere I'm Pushing Back:\n1. On KPIs: Yes, they're explicitly asking. Deliverable 1 is \"L&D Strategy & Framework\" that includes \"KPI set.\" But here's the thing—your KPIs would look different from corporate BS. You measure:\n\nReuse of materials (Iraq approach)\nPractice changes observed\nTime saved on briefs/tasks\nQuality of questions being asked (not just answered)\nThink about it this way: what would tell you if people are actually learning vs. just showing up? You already know this from Bloom—you measured \"behavior change instead of attendance.\" What's the UNICEF version of that?\n\n2. On repository design: You said \"Airtable or Google Form\" but then also \"RAG from conversations.\" Which is it? I think you're actually describing a two-layer system:\n\nLayer 1: Human-curated library (sticky notes, Airtable, tagged prompts)\nLayer 2: RAG as backup search when you can't find it manually\nIs that right? Because that's actually sophisticated—simple interface, smart backend. But you need to articulate it clearly.\n\n3. On brown bags: You're right to question what already exists. But you also need a proposed format in the proposal. Here's what I'm hearing from you:\n\nWeekly or bi-weekly touchpoint\nNOT passive lunch-and-learn\nShare-out of experiments people ran that week\nCrowdsource best practices\nSomeone (you?) captures insights for the repository\nIs that the structure? Give me a 30-minute format sketch.\n\nFollow-Up Questions (Round 2):\n1. Management Development - Be More Specific: You said focus on \"who the person is becoming\" not \"did you use an LLM.\" Beautiful principle. But what's a concrete activity you'd run with middle managers to help them do this? Give me one workshop exercise or one coaching conversation structure that embodies this.\n\n2. Cross-Cultural Facilitation - You Dodged This: You work across MENA, you facilitate in Arabic, you've navigated Lebanese/Iraqi/Palestinian contexts. UNICEF's team is global. How do you actually handle when someone's cultural reference for \"good feedback\" or \"psychological safety\" is completely different from someone else's? Give me a real example of when this happened and what you did.\n\n3. Sustainability Mechanisms - Connect to Your Iraq Work: In Iraq, you built in Climate Space gatherings, trainer cascades, government advocacy. For UNICEF, what are the 2-3 mechanisms you'd put in place from month one that would keep the learning culture going after you leave? Not vague (\"create ownership\")—specific structures.\n\n4. The Learning Committee - What Makes It Work?: You proposed 30-minute monthly cadence. Why 30 minutes? What happens in those 30 minutes that makes it effective rather than just another status meeting? What's the agenda structure? Who leads it?\n\n5. From Your Iraq Transcripts - Give Me a Story: You mentioned the \"grandparents' homes\" icebreaker and \"Omar's wedding invitations.\" Give me one story from the ToT (October 12-14) where your facilitation approach made a visible difference. A moment where you saw someone shift from anxious/resistant to engaged/learning. This is for the \"how I work\" section.\n\n6. AI Learning Survey Integration: They have survey results already. You said you'd interview people to uncover questions. But in the proposal, you need to show you understand their data. Can you articulate what you expect to find in an AI learning survey? What are the likely anxieties, skill gaps, and competing narratives about AI in an innovation office?\n\n7. Repository \"Three Clicks\" Rule: You emphasized this. Walk me through it:\n\nClick 1: ?\nClick 2: ?\nClick 3: Found it.\nWhat's the information architecture?\n\n8. Governance \"Sunset Rule\": You mentioned this in your technical proposal—retire stale content. How does that work in practice? Who decides what's stale? What's the process?\n\n9. The 90 Working Days: Your financial offer has 90 days over 8 months. That's roughly 11-12 days per month. What does your actual rhythm look like? Are you on-site (Stockholm/remote) certain weeks? Available for office hours? Running monthly sessions? Help me see the operating pattern.\n\n10. Why UNICEF Office of Innovation Specifically?: You gave the broad \"why\"—preventing shadow selves. But why this team? They work on child-focused innovation in 190 countries. They're testing and scaling solutions for kids in tough places. How does that connect to your work in conflict zones, your focus on post-traumatic growth, your \"actions by their intentions\" principle?\n\nTake your time with these. I'm looking for the specific examples and structures that make your approach real, not abstract. The proposal needs to show how you think in practice, not just what you believe in principle.\n\nOkay. Yeah. So let's see. What are the follow ups? Learning and development strategy and framework, Yeah. I think I have the framework that I've developed for how to use large language models to learn, what you don't know you needed to learn to do the things that you don't know you needed 2 And I think I'd like to potentially use that as a starting point of the framework. I'm not actually sure. I feel like there's, a bunch of stuff within the UNICEF proposal that I'm forgetting to be responding to, but, so Yeah. Let's see here. Okay. Technical soft skills and management learning priorities. Okay. Yeah. So can you give me some ideas about that? So I got the technical stuff, and the soft are are interesting, about collaboration and creativity and Open mindedness and I think it'll be interesting to see what soft skills You can derive from the way I've been talking and thinking about things And then staff surveys, interim work in AI learning survey results. What Okay. So key element of you facilitate rounds of conversation where staff can discuss topics of collective interest. Yeah. I think this is great. I I love to do both of these things. So having, like, the chill time to, like, chat and discuss and And then the more technical stuff. So technical upscaling, AI digital information, emergent tools, soft skills. Adaptive leadership collaboration, design thinking. Okay. That's cool. Creativity and resilience. It could be interesting to actually do design thinking as the container for learning a lot of this other stuff. Creativity and resilience and collaboration. Adaptive leadership, all of that kind of connects. So maybe that's one of the ways that we can frame it. Is, like, design like, creativity and design in a world dominated by AI. Or a world, like, Right. Where is creativity is and production is no longer the limiting factor or even reasoning. Like, what is AI in that world? And then so for activities, rounds of conversation, skill focus workshop, Yeah. Yeah. So let's let's think about we're gonna facilitate that learning activity, learning pathways, and resources. Yeah. Okay. So the the the curator of internal and external resources, I can start, but I would love to actually work with people to develop together. Consolidated needs assessment and learning plan. Yeah. So we have the staff surveys, 3 tracks. And so it could be nice to come up with an assessment that relates to the key deliverables and impacts. We can even come up with, like, a pre post assessment. And, yeah, it would be interesting even to use the LLM prepost assessment idea that I been working on to Have conversations with people, and to kind of identify where they're at. Although it's not essential, government and knowledge management tools. Strengthening the learning committee survey templates and simple dashboards. That sounds good. We can use either Google Docs or Airtable. Evidence of impact, lessons learned, guidance. Okay. So the kind of I think that's the kind of interesting idea. So we can have a few touch points. There's, like, there's the the brown bag stuff. There's the design thinking. As the container. And then something with the middle management's end like, the the the people. Maybe it's during the brown bag thing. But, yeah, I think that's that's some stuff to really think about here. And, yeah, let me let let's go through another round of questions. Cultural across cultural facilitation. Psychological safety, connect to your Iraq work, learning committee, what makes it work. I don't need the 30 minute monthly cadence. Let's change that. Just, like, delete it completely, and let's let's start from scratch, from from this content here, I think. I have learning survey. I don't think we need the 3 clicks thing. I don't know where that from either. Sunset rule. Yeah. Okay. Let's figure this out. Okay. Okay.\n\nShow less\n\nRecognized overwhelm, consolidated emerging framework, recalibrated approach toward drafting.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, you're right to pushback. I was adding complexity that's not actually required. Let me strip this down to what the ToR actually asks for and what you've already given me.\n\nWhat You've Already Answered (Strongly):\n✅ Psychological safety in transitions: Check-ins, dyads→triads→group, humor, grounding in values ✅ Rounds of conversation format: Weekly share-outs of experiments, crowdsource wisdom, sticky notes before RAG ✅ AI philosophy: Tool not assistant, convivial technology, manual fallback, focus on becoming not outputs ✅ Management development: Praise effort not output, focus on questions/explorations, pride in learning ✅ Your \"why\": Preventing shadow-selves, accessing creative humanity, embodied learning ✅ Design thinking as container: Frame for soft skills (collaboration, creativity, resilience, adaptive leadership)\n\nWhat's Actually Required (from ToR):\n6 Deliverables:\n\nL&D Strategy & Framework (technical + soft + management priorities, roadmap, governance, KPIs)\nNeeds Assessment & Learning Plan (integrate surveys/evaluation, validate with Committee)\nLearning Pathways (2+ tracks, pilots, feedback)\nLearning Activities (≥4: workshops, peer-learning, rounds of conversation)\nRepository & Governance Tools (curated resources, templates, dashboards, Committee support)\nFinal Report (outcomes, sustainability)\nWhat I Actually Need from You:\n1. The Framework You Mentioned:\nYou said: \"I have the framework for how to use LLMs to learn what you don't know you needed to learn.\"\n\nThis could BE your L&D Strategy core. Can you sketch it? Even just the main steps/principles? This would make your proposal immediately distinctive.\n\n2. Two Concrete Learning Pathways:\nToR wants \"at least two tracks.\" You suggested:\n\nTrack 1: Design Thinking as container (soft skills: collaboration, creativity, resilience, adaptive leadership)\nTrack 2: AI as convivial tool (technical: tool vs assistant, ethical use, manual fallback)\nDo these feel right? Or would you structure them differently?\n\n3. Four Learning Activities (Simple Format):\nYou need ≥4 activities. Based on what you've said:\n\nActivity 1: Weekly rounds of conversation (experiment share-outs)\nActivity 2: Design thinking workshop series\nActivity 3: ??? (maybe middle management cohort?)\nActivity 4: ??? (maybe AI ethics/practice workshop?)\nWhat are activities 3 and 4?\n\n4. Cross-Cultural Facilitation (You Skipped This Twice):\nUNICEF Office of Innovation is 190 countries, multicultural team. You work across MENA, facilitate in Arabic. Give me ONE example of when cultural differences showed up in facilitation and how you handled it. Just one story.\n\n5. Sustainability After June 2026:\nFrom your Iraq work, you built in: Climate Space gatherings, trainer cascades, government advocacy. For UNICEF, what 2-3 mechanisms would keep learning going after you leave? (You don't need elaborate—just the structures.)\n\nHere's What I Propose:\nI'm going to take everything you've given me across both rounds and draft the Technical Proposal sections based on YOUR words and philosophy. Then you can edit/refine rather than answering more questions.\n\nBut I need those 5 items above to complete it properly.\n\nFocus on:\n\nYour LLM learning framework (sketch it)\nConfirm the two learning pathways\nDefine activities 3 & 4\nOne cross-cultural story\n2-3 sustainability mechanisms\nEverything else—I'll build from what you've already said.\n\nSound good?\n\n\nINSPIRE & NAVIGATE Aligned Pedagogically Sound Frameworks For Transformational Learning Introduction - How to Learn What You Don’t Know Without A Teacher Learning how to learn is a critical skill in an era of change. To do this, we must know ourselves, our abilities, our limits and finally we must k\n\npasted\n\n\nAI For Growth July 14-16, 2023 Bloom Community Workshops Welcome! 1 01 02 03 Basic Principles for an Engaging Session Today’s topic: AI For Impact Homework to prepare for Tomorrow What will we learn today? 1 01 02 03 05 Basics about the operations of AI What do word-vectors and clustering imply for\n\npasted\n\nOk, here's some workshop pdfs I've used to train ngos and social enterprises on proper LLM use that can be useful \nMaybe you can help me think of what htey mean and expect from learning pathway and propose 3 alternatives and I can help pick from it. \n4 activities... let's think, i like the idea of seasons and rhythms and a circle having four parts  how can we think about that, or a compass \nI think our work working with accelerator programs that bridge between cameroon and lebanon we've found it incredibly hlepful to highlight and celebrate what's beautiful, one thing we do is collect music from each perosn and make a group play list and use that to play during the set up period of our workshops, it's a beautiful way to appreciate each other and see each other and have people share a bit abou ttheir world and why they chose that song yeah ,so having the resources, the questions, and a new framework they can use to assess themselves on if they are growing with LLMs or if LLMs and gen ai is blocking their growht and pride in their work - as well as prompts they can use, airtalbe with resources, and open questions baout ethical use and convivial technology. Sometimes, all it takes is a word or idea to open the space. One suggestion - am i using this as a TOOL or as an ASSISTANT - why or why not \n\nWhat's the 2 learning pathways vs learning activities can you help me align and do all this, I will paste some content from my methodology here: attached and my workshop ai fo rimpact which i give to social enterprises at Bloom:\n\nShow less\n\nSynthesized pedagogical frameworks to architect pathways, activities, and assessment tools.\n13s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerfect! Now I can see your actual facilitation DNA. The SCRIBER framework, the \"AI for Impact\" workshops, the music playlists, the tool vs assistant distinction, the focus on marginalized communities—this is all gold.\n\nLet me help clarify Learning Pathways vs Learning Activities in UNICEF's context, then propose alternatives.\n\nTerminology Clarification:\nLearning Pathways = Multi-session structured curriculum tracks (like your 3-day Bloom workshop)\n\nExample: \"AI Foundations\" pathway = 4 sessions over 6 weeks with homework/practice between\nLearning Activities = Individual facilitated events (one-time or recurring)\n\nExample: Weekly rounds of conversation, a 2-hour workshop, a peer cohort that meets 3 times\n3 Alternative Pathway Structures (You Pick):\nOption A: Seasonal Cycle Approach (Your Circle/Compass Idea)\nTwo pathways, each following a 4-part seasonal rhythm:\n\nPathway 1: \"AI as Convivial Tool\" (Technical + Ethics)\n\nSpring/East (Planting): What is AI? Embeddings, vectors, SCRIBER basics\nSummer/South (Growing): Hands-on practice with tool vs assistant distinction\nAutumn/West (Harvesting): Assess your growth—are you becoming or outsourcing?\nWinter/North (Reflecting): Ethical frameworks, bias detection, manual fallback\nPathway 2: \"Design Thinking for Plural Minds\" (Soft Skills + Management)\n\nSpring/East (Divergence): Generative ideation, exploring possibility space\nSummer/South (Experimentation): Rapid prototyping, learning from failure\nAutumn/West (Convergence): Decision-making with complexity, prioritization\nWinter/North (Integration): Adaptive leadership, holding paradox, team resilience\nWhy this works: Natural rhythm, familiar metaphor, built-in reflection points\n\nOption B: SCRIBER as Pathway Structure\nTwo pathways, each using SCRIBER elements as learning progression:\n\nPathway 1: \"From Prompt to Practice\" (AI Literacy)\n\nSession 1: Seek + Inquire (What's around my question? Hidden dimensions)\nSession 2: Critique + Broaden (Antagonist feedback, divergent thinking)\nSession 3: Reflect + Explain (Worksheets, transparency, catching mistakes)\nSession 4: Recurse + Apply (Autonomous agents, integration into workflow)\nPathway 2: \"Managing in Transition\" (Leadership Development)\n\nSession 1: Seek clarity on values (Who are we becoming in this transition?)\nSession 2: Critique current systems (What's not working? Why?)\nSession 3: Reflect on team needs (Psychological safety, energy management)\nSession 4: Recurse with new practices (Check-ins, dyads→triads, governance)\nWhy this works: Uses your existing framework, participants learn the method while applying it\n\nOption C: Bridging Worlds Approach (Your Bloom/ITC Experience)\nTwo pathways designed for cross-cultural, values-driven teams:\n\nPathway 1: \"Humanity-Centered AI\" (Technical + Values)\n\nModule 1: The escalator problem—Having vs Being (Erich Fromm reference)\nModule 2: SCRIBER for learning what you don't know you need to learn\nModule 3: Tool vs Assistant—Maintaining agency and pride in work\nModule 4: Building convivial technology practices in your team\nPathway 2: \"Leading Through Complexity\" (Management + Soft Skills)\n\nModule 1: Psychological safety in transition (Check-ins, music, beauty)\nModule 2: Design thinking for wicked problems (Diverge/converge cycles)\nModule 3: Facilitating difficult conversations (Dyads→triads→group)\nModule 4: Sustaining learning culture (Touchpoints, rhythms, governance)\nWhy this works: Bridges your Bloom training experience with UNICEF's innovation context\n\n4 Learning Activities Using Compass/Seasonal Metaphor:\nSince you like circles with 4 parts and rhythms, here's a structure for the ≥4 activities:\n\nThe Four Directions Learning Cycle:\nActivity 1: EAST (Spring/Dawn) - \"Rounds of Awakening\"\n\nFormat: Weekly brown bag conversation series (Feb-May, ~12 sessions)\nStructure: 45 minutes, rotating facilitators from team\nEach session starts with music (playlist from participants)\nShare-out format: \"One experiment I tried this week with AI/learning\"\nCapture: Sticky notes → Human-curated Airtable → Later indexed in RAG\nSeasonal theme: Planting seeds of practice, exposing experiments\nActivity 2: SOUTH (Summer/Noon) - \"Design Sprint Workshop\"\n\nFormat: 2-hour intensive workshop (March)\nUses design thinking as container for AI + soft skills\nChallenge: \"How might we learn in ways that make us more ourselves?\"\nIncludes: Divergent AI brainstorming, rapid prototyping, convergent prioritization\nEnds with celebration of beautiful ideas (even failed ones)\nSeasonal theme: Growth through heat/pressure, testing in the light\nActivity 3: WEST (Autumn/Dusk) - \"Harvest Peer Cohort\"\n\nFormat: 3-session peer learning cohort (April-May)\n8-10 middle managers meet to share what's working\nStructure: Check-in (10min) → Case clinic (30min) → Harvest (20min)\nFocus: \"What helped you become vs. what made you a shadow?\"\nTool: Self-assessment framework (Tool vs Assistant continuum)\nSeasonal theme: Gathering what worked, composting what didn't\nActivity 4: NORTH (Winter/Night) - \"Ethics & Reflection Workshop\"\n\nFormat: 2-hour closing workshop (Late May)\nDeep dive into ethical AI use, bias detection, convivial technology\nIncludes: MIT research on AI essay-writing harm, manual fallback practices\nFacilitation: Socratic dialogue, not lecture\nEnds with collective commitment: \"One practice I'll keep, one I'll stop\"\nSeasonal theme: Rest, integration, preparing for next cycle\nWhat You Still Need to Decide:\n1. Which Pathway Option? (A, B, or C?)\n\n2. Cross-Cultural Story: You keep dodging this. Give me ONE example of when cultural differences showed up in your facilitation (Lebanon/Iraq/Cameroon) and what you did. Even a short one.\n\n3. Sustainability Mechanisms: From Iraq you did Climate Space, trainer cascades, government advocacy. For UNICEF, what 2-3 structures would keep this going after June 2026?\n\n4. Repository Structure: You said \"Airtable + RAG.\" Walk me through it:\n\nClick 1: ?\nClick 2: ?\nClick 3: Found it.\n5. Learning Committee Operating Rhythm: Not 30 minutes—you're right. What's the right cadence and agenda structure?\n\nOnce you answer these 5, I'll synthesize everything into your Technical Proposal and strengthen the Cover Letter with specific examples from your work.\n\nSound good?\n\nI'm not sure, I like all of them for the two pathways if you had to review my work and UNCIEFs goals with this contract which would you pick? \nAfter we pick the 4 activities will be more clear right? They are basically hte things we do to operate the pathways? or did i get this wrong?\ncross cultural differences we navigated were about language and translation, and how people in MENA, particularly Iraq, have difficulty identifying themselves as needing help/failure is not really an option, so working to come to a third new place where we don't identify flaws, we reframe and identify growth edges and get teams to work together on other people's projects we were able to ease into potentially difficult areas and talk about things that in the Iraqi culture people didn't want to address...\n3 sustainability mechanisms, i would recommend we find a way to offer people acronyms, key ideas and takeaways that are universal and timeless where they can check in with themselves, journaling practices, and potential additions to the L&D/culture at Unicef to create a common language around LLMs - perhaps it's about the importance of curation, LLMs and gen ai as a tool or as an assistant, or even these as questions and tensions. not sure what else you recommend, it's hard to add things to people's schedule even more\n\nREpo, let's just make it airtable with a RAG that leverages the content inside of it \n\nlet's see the right cadence after we decide on what we're doing here's the attachments: ",

      "content": "The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.",

      "content": "Here are the 10 questions I’d love you to answer so I can really sharpen your application:\n\n1. **Agency / Community / Ubuntu / Craft**  \nWhen you think of “agency, community, ubuntu, humanity, craft, strengths-based approach,” what’s one concrete workshop or program where those values *showed up in the room*? Describe the context, what you did, and what changed for participants.\n\n2. **Check-ins & Creative Vulnerability**  \nWhat’s your favorite way to open a session when people are stressed or skeptical? Give 2–3 example check-in prompts or mini-exercises you’ve used to create “creative vulnerability” and psychological safety.\n\n3. **Soft + Technical Skills Together**  \nYou wrote that soft skills and community focus “connecting more with the why” help navigate the technical “why” of AI and tools. Can you describe one activity where you deliberately braided a technical AI/LLM skill with a soft skill (e.g. collaboration, feedback, resilience) in a single exercise?\n\n4. **The Skeptical Type-A Story**  \nTell me the story of that Type A person who was dubious about your work.  \nWho were they (role), what were they skeptical about, what happened in the session, and what did they say/do by the end that showed a real shift?\n\n5. **Cross-Cultural Facilitation in MENA / Iraq**  \nYou mentioned that in Iraq people struggle to identify themselves as “needing help” and failure isn’t really an option. Walk me through a specific moment where you used reframing (growth edges, working on others’ projects, etc.) to get an Iraqi or regional team talking honestly about challenges.\n\n6. **Your AI / LLM Learning Framework in Simple Terms**  \nIf you had to explain your INSPIRE / SCRIBER / “AI for Impact” way-of-working to a UNICEF manager in *three to five bullet points*, what would you say? (Think: “How to use LLMs to learn what you don’t know you need to learn, without outsourcing your thinking.”)\n\n7. **Rounds of Conversation: Your Go-To Format**  \nImagine a brown-bag “round of conversation” at UNICEF OOI. In 60–90 minutes, what’s your ideal structure? (e.g. opening, check-in, sharing experiments, small groups, closing). Please outline it as a simple timeline.\n\n8. **Lightweight Governance / Learning Committee**  \nIn your ideal world, how would the Learning Committee actually function so it feels *lightweight and alive*, not bureaucratic? Give a sample recurring meeting agenda and 2–3 “rules of thumb” you’d propose for them.\n\n9. **Evidence of Impact (Not Just Attendance)**  \nFrom your past work (Bloom, Iraq, AI for Impact, Nawaya, etc.), what are 3–5 *specific* indicators you’ve used (or wish you had used) to show that learning was working? Think behavior changes, reuse of tools, quality of questions, etc.\n\n10. **End-State Vision for UNICEF OOI**  \nIf this consultancy goes beautifully, what do you hope a staff member in the Office of Innovation will say in June 2026 when someone asks, “What changed about how you learn here?”  \nWrite it as a short quote, in their voice.\n\nAnswer these in your own language and I’ll weave them into a sharper cover letter + technical proposal that feels very “you.”",

      "content": "Okay, Agency Ubuntu. Yeah, so we've been doing all that at Bloom. I mean, we've done this. You know what, let me give you the program management guide for Bloom for the last 10 years. Check-ins and creative vulnerability. Yeah, we just do check-ins where we ask people for credit to check in and then something more closely aligned with their exploration, question, work, soft and technical skills. Yeah, we like to use the Values in Action Characters profile from the School of Positive Psychology and kind of thinking about what makes you come alive and bringing that to what you're doing to make sure that, you know, you're showing up with the thing that makes you unique. All the crazy forces at play in the thousands and millions of things that have happened to bring you to this place gives you an insight that a machine would never have that is homogenized across the world. And we need to make sure that shows up as representative. So that type A person was dubious. And then by the end, they're like, oh, my God, it's actually real. And it's great. I love the fact that I'm sharing and connecting with these other teams. And it's true that we're stronger when we're together. Yeah. So people in UROC, they generally don't like asking for help. Yeah. So getting them to work on this, you know, reframe of growth edges was really helpful and getting them to not only ask for help, but also give help was transformative. Three to five bullet points. Yeah. So how to use an LLM to learn what you don't need to know, don't know you need to learn. So, you know, the basic thing is the embedding space is basically a map of human knowledge, but people don't know what they're doing with the prompts to kind of explore that and just getting that technical understanding of sort of, you know, direction and space being the metaphor, I think, is just a deep intuition that's going to be super helpful for people. Rounds of conversation and go to format. Yeah. Open, check in, sharing experiments, small groups and closing, opening with gratitude and curiosity and just naming the qualities and maybe even like kind of talking about the people that we know that kind of live up to those best shout outs for people that have helped is really great and just really kind of creating an uplifting kind of environment. I'm not actually sure what this is. What do they mean by learning committee and governance? So I need your help here. Maybe come up with three different ways based on everything that you've heard from me and that, you know, for me, maybe you can help me figure this out. Evidence of impact. Yeah. So basically, I think the first thing is to have a good understanding of what you're basically. We have a great. Post program long form exit interviews where people have been talking about how the values that they've learned have been really helpful and that they've taken it out of the program and into other parts of their personal and professional lives is really beautiful. We have our assessments pre and post that show not only people's growth, but also the development of their organizations, as well as the. Buffering effects that we've had with catastrophes, so people within our program and not within our program. That's what I did my master's research on in terms of post-traumatic growth and things like that. It turns out people in our programs are more likely to rock on and to state, yeah, staff member, Office of Innovation will say what changed about how you learn here. Yeah. You know, maybe it's something about like we learned. To. Identify, highlight and promote the unique perspectives and. Experiences and. How they inform our experiments and explorations moving forward and learn to see each other. And. Support each other in communities of safety and to emphasize our agency over our usage of these tools as not replacing us, but serving us. Serving us and serving us as a community and our our hearts as explorers, something like that.",

      "content": "Great, this is plenty to work with. I’ll answer your specific “what should we do?” questions and give you copy-ready pieces you can drop into the technical proposal / forms.\n\nI’ll cover:\n\n1. Which pathways to pick (and why)  \n2. How pathways vs activities relate  \n3. 4 concrete learning activities  \n4. Learning Committee & governance (3 models + a recommended one)  \n5. Sustainability mechanisms  \n6. KPIs (so you’re not stuck)  \n7. Short “story paragraphs” you can paste in (cross-cultural + impact + rounds of conversation)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Which pathways to pick?\n\nGiven:\n\n- UNICEF’s ToR → very explicit about **AI learning** + **management/middle-management**  \n- Your strengths → **humanity-centred AI**, **psych safety & community**, **post-trauma contexts**, **design thinking as a container**\n\nI’d go with Option C, but name them in UNICEF-friendly language:\n\n**Pathway 1 – “AI Foundations for Impact (Humanity-Centred AI)”**  \nFocus: technical + ethical + agency.\n\nDraft structure:\n\n1. **How AI actually works (the map of human knowledge)**  \n   - Embedding space as “map”, direction in vector space as intuition.  \n   - What LLMs are good/bad at.\n\n2. **Tool vs Assistant: Protecting Agency and Craft**  \n   - “Am I using this as a **tool** or as an **assistant**, and why?”  \n   - When over-delegation leads to “shadow self” work.\n\n3. **SCRIBER/INSPIRE to Think for Yourself**  \n   - Use SCRIBER as a method to learn what you *didn’t know you needed to learn*.  \n   - Prompts that deepen thinking rather than replace it.\n\n4. **Ethical Guardrails & Manual Fallback**  \n   - Bias, hallucinations, “manual fallback” practices.  \n   - Simple rules for safe use in UNICEF’s context.\n\n---\n\n**Pathway 2 – “Leading Through Complexity & Collaboration (Management for Innovators)”**  \nFocus: soft skills + management development.\n\nDraft structure:\n\n1. **Psychological Safety in Transition**  \n   - Check-ins, dyads → triads → group; creative vulnerability.  \n   - Naming anxieties around AI, jobs, and relevance.\n\n2. **Design Thinking as Container for Learning**  \n   - Use design thinking to hold AI + innovation + team tensions.  \n   - Diverge / converge cycles for real UNICEF problems.\n\n3. **Feedback, Growth Edges, and Cross-Cultural Help-Seeking**  \n   - From “failure is not an option” → “growth edges we explore together”.  \n   - Case work on giving/receiving help across cultures.\n\n4. **Building a Learning Culture (Managers as Hosts)**  \n   - How managers run check-ins, rounds of conversation, and reflection.  \n   - Simple habits: what they do monthly / quarterly.\n\nYou can literally swap these names into your Technical Proposal where you currently have “e.g., AI Foundations, Management for Innovators”.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Pathways vs Activities (so it’s clear)\n\n- **Pathways = the structured tracks** (like mini-curricula, 3–4 modules each).  \n- **Activities = the concrete events** you run that *deliver parts of those pathways*.\n\nOne activity can serve one or both pathways (e.g., a brown-bag “Round” that surfaces both AI and management issues).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Four learning activities (aligned with ToR)\n\nHere’s a clean set that hits their “≥4 activities” requirement and fits your style:\n\n1. **Rounds of Conversation: “AI & Learning in Our Daily Work” (Series)**  \n   - Format: 45–60 min brown-bag sessions (e.g., monthly or every 3 weeks).  \n   - Flow:\n     1. Check-in (with gratitude + shout-outs).  \n     2. 2–3 people share AI / learning experiments they tried.  \n     3. Small groups (dyads/triads) to react and extract “what worked”.  \n     4. Group harvest: 3–5 sticky insights added to Airtable.  \n   - Delivers: Pathway 1 (AI Foundations) + Pathway 2 (Leading Through Complexity).  \n   - This clearly fulfils “rounds of conversation / brown bag lunches”.\n\n2. **Workshop 1: “AI Foundations for Impact”**  \n   - 2-hour structured session.  \n   - Content: embedding-space intuition, tool vs assistant, first SCRIBER exercises.  \n   - Output: participants leave with 2–3 prompts and one practice to try that week.  \n   - Delivers: core of Pathway 1.\n\n3. **Peer-Learning Group: “Managing Through Transition” (Middle-Management Cohort)**  \n   - 3 x 60–90 min sessions over 6–8 weeks.  \n   - Flow each time:\n     - Check-in.  \n     - One “case clinic” from a manager (e.g., resistance, anxiety, ethics).  \n     - Group uses growth-edge framing instead of “failure/blame”.  \n     - Harvest: 2–3 practices to try before next session.  \n   - Delivers: Pathway 2.\n\n4. **Workshop 2: “Learning, Wellbeing, and Ethics in an AI-Rich Workplace”**  \n   - 2-hour closing/reflection workshop.  \n   - Bring in: MIT findings on LLM “brain rot”, your tool vs assistant frame, convivial tech.  \n   - Participants journal on: “Am I growing with LLMs, or are they blocking my pride in work?”  \n   - Delivers: both pathways; closes the cycle and feeds the Final Report.\n\nYou can present these as the minimum 4, while noting the rounds of conversation are a *series* across the period.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Learning Committee & governance (what it is + 3 models)\n\n**What “Learning Committee & governance” means here**  \nIn UNICEF language, this is basically:\n\n- A small group of staff who:\n  - help set learning priorities,  \n  - give feedback on pathways/activities,  \n  - steward the repository and KPIs.\n- “Governance” = clear **decision rights + rhythm + criteria** (not bureaucracy).\n\n### Three models (based on your style)\n\n**Model 1 – Steward Circle (simple, stable)**  \n- 6–8 people (mix of technical, operations, management, HR).  \n- **Cadence:** Monthly 60-min meeting + async comments in between.  \n- **Agenda:**\n  1. Check-in (10 min).  \n  2. Look at 2–3 KPIs + qualitative stories (20 min).  \n  3. Decide 1–2 small adjustments (e.g., next round topic, resource gap) (20 min).  \n  4. Assign stewards to follow up (10 min).  \n- Governance: clear that they **advise + steward**, not micromanage.\n\n**Model 2 – Rotating Hosts (agency & ubuntu)**  \n- Same size, but facilitation **rotates every month**.  \n- Each month a different member curates:\n  - one story of impact,  \n  - one tension / challenge,  \n  - one resource to add/retire.  \n- This mirrors your “agency, community, ubuntu” focus and keeps ownership distributed.\n\n**Model 3 – Async-First, Quarterly Deep Dives**  \n- Small committee, plus:\n  - Teams/Slack channel where anyone can drop resources/questions.  \n  - Airtable is updated continuously by staff.  \n- Every quarter: 2-hour “Learning Deep Dive” to:\n  - review what’s being used,  \n  - prune stale content,  \n  - choose next quarter’s focus.\n\n### What I’d recommend for UNICEF\n\nI’d propose **Model 2** in the technical proposal:\n\n- It fits your strengths (shared agency, strengths-based, rotating leadership).  \n- It doesn’t add many new meetings: a monthly 60-min session, plus async.\n\nYou can describe it as:\n\n> A small Learning Committee with rotating hosts. Each month, one member curates an impact story, a tension, and a resource update, and hosts a 60-minute meeting. This keeps governance light, participatory, and grounded in real practice rather than bureaucratic reporting.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Sustainability mechanisms (after June 2026)\n\nBased on what you said (acronyms, common language, journaling, minimal extra meetings), here are **3 concrete mechanisms**:\n\n1. **Shared Language & Anchor Questions**  \n   - Introduce 2–3 simple phrases that live on:\n     - “Tool or Assistant?” (as a live question)  \n     - “Growth edges, not deficits” (for feedback)  \n     - “Sticky notes before RAG” (human curation before automation)  \n   - These become quick tests managers and staff can use *inside existing meetings*.\n\n2. **Micro-Rituals in Existing Meetings (no new calendar load)**  \n   - 10-minute “learning check-in” once a month in team meetings:\n     - One thing I tried.  \n     - One thing I learned.  \n     - One question I still have.  \n   - This is explicitly documented as part of the L&D strategy so it continues after you.\n\n3. **Distributed Learning Stewards + Airtable Repository**  \n   - Each team nominates a “learning steward” who:\n     - adds their team’s best prompts/resources to Airtable,  \n     - brings 1–2 highlights to the Learning Committee quarterly.  \n   - The repository + simple RAG search sits at the centre, so no one person has to “be the L&D department”.\n\nYou can slot these into the “sustainability”/final report section.\n\n---\n\n## 6. KPIs (6–8 you can copy-paste)\n\nHere’s a set that matches your philosophy **and** ToR:\n\n1. **AI Confidence & Agency**  \n   - % of staff reporting *increased confidence* using AI tools **without feeling their own voice is lost** (pre/post survey).\n\n2. **Practice Adoption**  \n   - # / % of teams that adopt at least **one new learning practice** (e.g., regular check-ins, rounds of conversation, peer case clinics).\n\n3. **Repository Use**  \n   - Number of **unique users** accessing the Airtable/RAG repository per month, and the **top reused resources**.\n\n4. **Middle-Management Development**  \n   - % of participating managers who report improved ability to:  \n     a) create psychological safety,  \n     b) give growth-edge feedback,  \n     c) host learning conversations.\n\n5. **Experimentation Rate**  \n   - # of AI / process **experiments** shared in rounds of conversation / peer groups over the period (a proxy for real learning-in-practice).\n\n6. **Qualitative Impact Stories**  \n   - At least **10 staff narratives** collected (short interviews) on “how my way of learning changed,” coded for themes (agency, collaboration, creativity).\n\n7. **Sustainability Indicator**  \n   - By June 2026, Learning Committee and stewards have:  \n     - met independently at least twice, and  \n     - updated the repository + KPIs without your direct facilitation.\n\nIf you need to keep it to 6, you can drop #7.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Copy-ready paragraphs (you can paste these)\n\n### a) Cross-cultural facilitation\n\n> In my recent work designing sustainability training in Mosul, Iraq, I had to navigate a culture where “failure is not an option” and asking for help can feel shameful. Instead of framing learning around deficits, I introduced the idea of “growth edges” and designed activities where participants worked on *each other’s* projects. This allowed people to talk about sensitive challenges indirectly, through supporting a peer, and gradually normalize vulnerability. One initially very Type-A, skeptical participant ended the program saying that what changed everything was realizing “we are stronger together” when we give and receive help across teams. This kind of culturally sensitive reframing is central to how I facilitate in multicultural, high-stakes environments.\n\n### b) Evidence of impact\n\n> Over the last decade at Bloom, I have designed and run accelerator and learning programs with 900+ enterprises across 16 countries. Our evaluation combines pre/post assessments, long-form exit interviews, and comparison groups. My Master’s research on post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs during Lebanon’s crises showed that participants in our programs reported higher levels of agency, learning, and wellbeing, and were more likely to “rock on” in the face of shocks compared to peers who did not participate. Many participants described applying the program’s practices—check-ins, peer support, and experiment-driven learning—far beyond the original context, in both their personal and professional lives.\n\n### c) Rounds of conversation format\n\n> For “rounds of conversation” or brown-bag sessions, my go-to format is simple and human: we start with a brief check-in that invites gratitude and shout-outs, move into 2–3 short sharings of real experiments people tried that week (for example, a new way they used an LLM), then shift into small groups to unpack what worked, what felt uncomfortable, and what questions remain. We close by harvesting 3–5 concrete insights or “sticky notes” into a shared Airtable. This keeps the rounds informal and psychologically safe while ensuring they generate reusable learning, not just pleasant conversations.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, next step I can:\n\n- Rewrite your Technical Proposal to reflect **these two pathways + four activities + governance + KPIs** in one coherent narrative, using your voice.",

Learning pathways vs learning activities (in your language)\n\nIn UNICEF terms:\n\n- **Learning pathways** = the *journeys* (multi-step tracks)\n- **Learning activities** = the *moments* along those journeys (workshops, cohorts, rounds of conversation, etc.)\n\nGiven your work and their ToR, I’d pick **Option C**:\n\n#### Pathway 1 – *Humanity-Centred AI for Innovators* (technical + values)\n\n> “How do we use AI in ways that make us *more ourselves*, not shadows of ourselves?”\n\nRough shape:\n\n1. **Seeing the Map**  \n   - Gentle intro to embeddings/word vectors as “a map of human language and ideas”  \n   - What AI is good at / bad at, in plain language\n\n2. **Tool vs Assistant**  \n   - The “Am I using this as a *tool* or an *assistant* — and why?” question  \n   - Brain-rot risks, pride in craft, manual fallback\n\n3. **SCRIBER for Learning**  \n   - Use SCRIBER to *learn what you didn’t know you needed to learn*  \n   - From single prompts → iterative dialogue → genuine understanding\n\n4. **Convivial Practices**  \n   - Small, humane team norms (attribution, reflection, “show your working,” journaling)  \n   - Design a tiny “AI use charter” that fits UNICEF’s ethics\n\n#### Pathway 2 – *Leading Through Complexity & Change* (management + soft skills)\n\n> “How do we lead people through a transition without losing our humanity or our sense of humour?”\n\nRough shape:\n\n1. **Psychological Safety in Transition**  \n   - Check-ins, creative vulnerability, dyads → triads → group  \n   - Normalizing uncertainty and mixed feelings about AI / reorgs\n\n2. **Strengths, Agency & Ubuntu**  \n   - VIA strengths / “what makes you come alive” work  \n   - Reframing from “deficits” to “growth edges” and mutual support\n\n3. **Design Thinking as Container**  \n   - Use design thinking to hold real OOI challenges  \n   - Practice giving/receiving feedback across cultures, safely\n\n4. **Rhythms & Rituals of Learning**  \n   - Building small, repeatable practices into existing meetings  \n   - How managers can keep learning alive without adding 10 new meetings\n\n---\n\n### 2. Four learning activities that sit inside those pathways\n\nYou need ≥4 activities. These can live inside the pathways and also tick Deliverable 4.\n\n1. **Rounds of Conversation: “What I Tried This Week”**  \n   - 45–60 min brown-bag series  \n   - Opening check-in (gratitude, “who helped you this week?”)  \n   - 2–3 staff share a small AI / learning experiment they ran  \n   - Breakouts to react, steal ideas, and adapt them  \n   - One person captures “sticky notes” → added to Airtable library\n\n2. **Workshop: “AI As Tool, Not Boss”**  \n   - 2-hour, highly interactive session from Pathway 1  \n   - Short, playful explainer on embeddings (“map of human knowledge”)  \n   - Live demo of TOOL vs ASSISTANT use on real OOI tasks  \n   - People leave with 3–5 “house prompts” and a simple self-check\n\n3. **Peer Cohort: “Managers in Transition”**  \n   - 3 x 75-minute sessions for middle managers  \n   - Structure each time: check-in → one real case → group coaching → harvest  \n   - Focus on: growth-edge language, asking for help, supporting pride in work *with* AI in the mix\n\n4. **Design Thinking Lab: “Learning Our Way Through a Wicked Problem”**  \n   - ½-day lab using a live OOI challenge  \n   - Mix of technical and non-technical staff  \n   - People prototype *learning experiments*, not products (e.g., “for 4 weeks, we’ll test X tiny change in how we brief AI and see what happens”)  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Learning Committee & governance — what it is, and 3 ways you’d run it\n\n**What UNICEF means:**  \nA small group that **keeps an eye on the learning ecosystem**: which skills matter now, what’s working, what’s not, and what to adjust.\n\nThree versions that fit you:\n\n#### Option 1 – *Learning Stewards Circle* (lightweight, human)\n\n- 5–7 people across roles (tech, ops, HR, programme)  \n- **Monthly 60-min call**, agenda:  \n  1. 10 min check-in (how are we *really* arriving?)  \n  2. 15 min “signals from the field” (what people are trying, where they’re stuck)  \n  3. 20 min decisions: what to amplify, what to quietly retire, what to test next  \n  4. 15 min housekeeping: calendar, who’s hosting what  \n- Rotating chair so it doesn’t become “HR’s meeting”\n\n#### Option 2 – *Pathway Co-Stewards* (tied to the two pathways)\n\n- For each pathway, 2 stewards: one technical, one soft-skills/people  \n- **Short bi-weekly 30-min huddle**:  \n  - Look at 2–3 simple indicators (attendance, reuse of materials, “would you recommend?”)  \n  - Decide one small tweak per cycle  \n- Once per quarter, stewards meet as a full Learning Committee for a 90-min “seasonal review”\n\n#### Option 3 – *Embedded Governance* (minimal extra meetings)\n\n- Use **existing all-staff / team meetings**  \n- 10-minute “learning weather report” slot monthly:  \n  - One story of a successful experiment  \n  - One growth edge we’re noticing  \n  - One small invitation (e.g., “this month, notice where you’re using AI as a crutch vs tool”)  \n- Learning Committee does its work mostly async in a shared doc + chat channel; meets synchronously only at key points (e.g., before/after big activities)\n\nYou can say you’d **start with Option 1** and progressively move toward Option 3 as the culture and habits mature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Sustainability mechanisms (after June 2026)\n\nIn your words, this could be something like:\n\n- **Shared language pack.**  \n  A one-pager of acronyms and questions everyone knows (e.g., SCRIBER basics, “Tool or Assistant?”, “What growth edge am I working on?”). This lets teams keep checking in with themselves without a consultant in the room.\n\n- **Rotating hosts for rounds of conversation.**  \n  I start by hosting, then progressively hand facilitation to staff so the format survives me. By the end, the Learning Committee can run the whole cycle.\n\n- **Tiny reflection rituals, not new meetings.**  \n  For example, adding one question to existing 1:1s and team meetings:  \n  > “What did you try differently this week, and what did you learn?”  \n  That’s enough to keep a learning culture alive if people actually ask it.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Repository structure (Airtable + simple RAG)\n\nKeep this very simple in the proposal:\n\n> “I’ll set up a small Airtable as the front-door — one row per resource — and, if useful, we can layer a very lightweight RAG chatbot on top of that same content.”\n\nEach Airtable row:\n\n- Title  \n- Type (prompt pack, guide, video, slide deck, etc.)  \n- Track (Technical / Soft Skills / Management)  \n- 2-line “why this is useful here” (your Ubuntu/humanity piece)  \n- How it was used at OOI (real use case)  \n- Tags and owner\n\n**Three clicks in practice:**\n\n1. Open the table or simple interface (by track or role)  \n2. Filter by topic / track / type  \n3. Click into the resource (with context + link)\n\nIf people still can’t find something, they can ask the RAG chatbot, which only searches that curated content — so AI is riding on top of human curation, not replacing it.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Your “How to learn what you don’t know you needed to learn (with an LLM)” bullets\n\nHere’s a 5-bullet version in your style:\n\n- **Treat the model as a map, not an oracle.**  \n  I explain embeddings as “a huge, fuzzy map of human language.” Our job is to learn how to walk that map with good questions, not to copy-paste whatever comes back.\n\n- **Start wide, then zoom.**  \n  I use SCRIBER-style prompts to first *seek* what’s around my question and uncover hidden dimensions, then gradually narrow toward what matters for our context.\n\n- **Invite a friendly critic.**  \n  I often ask the model to argue with its own answers, or to take on an antagonist role. This helps participants see that the first answer is just a starting point, not “the truth.”\n\n- **Make it explain itself.**  \n  I ask the model to show its working, translate ideas into plain language, and help people build their own worksheets. The test is: can you still explain this tomorrow without the AI?\n\n- **Always loop back to your own judgment.**  \n  Every interaction ends with a human check-in: “What feels right here? What doesn’t? What will *we* actually try?” That keeps agency and craft at the center.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Cross-cultural facilitation story (you can paste this as-is)\n\n> “In Iraq and across much of MENA, I’ve noticed that ‘needing help’ can feel shameful. Failure is not really an option culturally, especially in professional spaces. In our Mosul training, this showed up as people hesitating to name their gaps.\n> \n> Instead of forcing people to confess weaknesses, I reframed everything around **growth edges** and mutual support. We started by working on *other people’s* projects in small groups, so no one was exposed alone. I invited teams to offer help to each other before asking for it themselves.\n> \n> Over a few days, something shifted. A very type-A participant who had been quite dubious at first told me, ‘I didn’t expect this to be real. But I love that I’m sharing and connecting with these other teams — we really are stronger together.’ That’s the moment where I know the container is working: people can talk honestly about what they need to learn, without losing dignity.”\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, next step I can take these pieces and **rewrite your Technical Proposal sections** (governance, pathways, activities, approach) so they read as one coherent story — still in your voice, just a bit more structured.",

      "content": "Here’s a clean, honest critique based on the new drafts + your revision summary, keeping your voice and priorities in mind. fileciteturn3file1turn3file2turn3file0  \n\n## 5 Pros\n\n1. **It finally sounds like you.**  \n   The cover letter and proposal are clearly “Bilal-shaped”: agency, ubuntu, craft, strengths-based, check-ins, music, growth edges, all there. This is a big upgrade from earlier, more generic versions.\n\n2. **Direct alignment with the 6 deliverables.**  \n   Each ToR output has a concrete plan: pathways, activities, repository, Learning Committee, KPIs. A reviewer can literally tick their checklist while reading.\n\n3. **Strong, practice-based pedagogy (not buzzwordy L&D).**  \n   SCRIBER, rounds of conversation, dyads → triads → group, VIA strengths, “growth edges not flaws” — these are specific, teachable methods, not vague “we will foster engagement” promises.\n\n4. **Evidence of impact is real, not hand-wavy.**  \n   You bring in your master’s research on post-traumatic growth, Bloom’s buffering effect during Lebanon’s crises, and concrete stories from Iraq. That signals “this isn’t just a nice story; it works.”\n\n5. **Sustainability is baked in, not tacked on.**  \n   Peer facilitators, quarterly Learning Committee, sunset rule, Airtable + RAG, shared language (SCRIBER, tool vs assistant, growth edges). It’s clear how things continue after June 2026.\n\n---\n\n## 5 Cons / Risks\n\n1. **Length and density may overwhelm reviewers.**  \n   The technical proposal reads like a beautiful mini-book. Great for depth, risky for a time-poor panel. Key ideas could get lost; they may skim and miss your strongest points.\n\n2. **You might be over-weighting AI vs “plain” L&D.**  \n   The AI framing is powerful, but the ToR is equally about soft skills and management development. Right now, AI is the spine; UNICEF might want to see AI as one strong thread inside a broader L&D strategy.\n\n3. **Some language is emotionally strong for UN style.**  \n   Phrases like “brain rot,” “shadow of themselves,” “this could block our common creative humanity” are true to you, but may feel a bit heavy or informal to some HR/OOI reviewers. We may want 1–2 of these as sharp hook phrases, not 10.\n\n4. **Children / UNICEF’s mission are in the background, not foreground.**  \n   The proposal is very focused on internal culture and AI/learning. It could more explicitly tie learning outcomes to UNICEF’s impact for children, which is what they ultimately care about.\n\n5. **Governance assumptions might be a bit over-specified.**  \n   You propose very concrete rhythms (16 rounds, 100+ resources, exact session counts, etc.). Great for clarity, but if they see it as inflexible or heavy, they might worry about bandwidth. Some of this could be framed more as “options” or “default pattern we’ll adapt with you.”\n\n---\n\n## 5 New Questions to Clean & Align\n\n1. **How “spiky” do you want the voice to be?**  \n   Which 2–3 strong phrases MUST stay because they are your heart (e.g. “shadows of ourselves,” “hearts as explorers”), and where are you okay softening language to match UNICEF tone?\n\n2. **Where do you want to explicitly connect to children’s outcomes?**  \n   What’s one clear through-line from “better internal learning culture in OOI” → “stronger innovation pipelines” → “better outcomes for children”? We can weave that sentence into the cover letter and intro of the proposal.\n\n3. **What’s your minimum viable version of this plan?**  \n   If UNICEF said, “We love this but need something lighter,” what would a “smallest coherent version” look like (e.g., 1 pathway + 2 activities + lighter repository)? Naming that helps us signal flexibility.\n\n4. **Which 3–4 elements of your approach are absolutely non-negotiable?**  \n   For example:  \n   - check-ins & creative vulnerability,  \n   - growth-edges framing,  \n   - agency-protecting AI practices (tool vs assistant, SCRIBER),  \n   - peer-led continuation.  \n   Knowing your top 3–4 lets us cut or compress everything else first.\n\n5. **How much do you want to foreground Bloom / past programs vs keep focus on UNICEF?**  \n   Are you happy with the current balance, or do you want one short “track record” section and MORE space on “here’s exactly how this lands in your specific Office of Innovation context”?\n\nIf you answer those, I can help you trim, sharpen, and re-balance so it still feels like you, but reads as “obvious fit” for what UNICEF is asking and likely worrying about.",

      "content": "Gotcha, this helps a lot. Let me do what you asked in this round and not rewrite anything yet.\n\n### 1. Quick alignment with your 5 points\n\n1. **Soften the language**  \n   - Right now there are a few “big” phrases like *“navigating an existential question: What is human work for in an age of AI?”* and *“I don’t teach generic frameworks”* that land a bit sharp, even if they’re true. fileciteturn4file16turn4file4  \n   - Easy fix: keep the clarity but soften the edges, e.g. “this raises deep questions about what human work is for…” / “rather than generic frameworks, I work from first principles…”\n\n2. **“We only teach what we know” / co-learning with LLMs**  \n   - This is implied (you talk about first-principles AI understanding and lived practice), but not explicitly stated. fileciteturn4file16  \n   - We can add one line in both proposal + cover letter about *designing while learning alongside the team* so it feels humble, experiential, and not “guru”.\n\n3. **2 pathways + ≥4 activities (and show you do both strategy + hands-on)**  \n   - V2 already does this:  \n     - Pathways: **“Humanity-Centered AI”** and **“Leading Through Complexity”** (4 modules each). fileciteturn4file16turn4file10  \n     - 4+ activities: Rounds of Conversation, AI Foundations workshop, Management Peer Cohort, Ethics & Reflection workshop. fileciteturn4file13turn4file15  \n   - What’s missing is an *explicit* one-liner mapping to their bullet 3 & 4 so they instantly see: “Yes, these are your 2 pathways; yes, these are your 4 required activities.”\n\n4. **Core spine: agency protection, tool vs assistant, peer/cooperative learning, embeddings/space (SCRIBER)**  \n   - All of these are in there but spread out. SCRIBER + “map not oracle” + tool vs assistant + growth-edges language are described in detail. fileciteturn4file16turn4file7turn4file12  \n   - We can make a “Core Learning Principles” mini-box early in the Technical Proposal that just names these 3–4 anchors so reviewers don’t miss them.\n\n5. **Bloom as proof of track record**  \n   - Bloom and your 10 years / 1,000+ entrepreneurs show up clearly in V2, but mostly mid-document. fileciteturn4file5turn4file17  \n   - We can pull Bloom up earlier as “this is not theoretical; this is what we’ve been doing for a decade.”\n\n---\n\n### 2. Five pros (what’s really working)\n\n1. **Crystal-clear structure vs the ToR**  \n   - Six deliverables map almost 1:1 to UNICEF’s list, with phases, days, outputs, and dates. It’s easy for them to see you’ve covered everything. fileciteturn4file10turn4file19  \n\n2. **Distinctive, human voice**  \n   - The cover letter genuinely sounds like you: grounded, values-based, not corporate. The Type-A Iraqi participant story and “shadow vs more myself” line are memorable and human. fileciteturn4file5turn4file18  \n\n3. **Strong match to “strategy + hands-on execution”**  \n   - You clearly show both: strategy, KPIs, governance *and* concrete workshops, cohorts, agendas, and check-ins. They asked for that exact combo; you’re over-delivering on it. fileciteturn4file6turn4file13  \n\n4. **Evidence-backed, not just vibes**  \n   - Masters research, buffering effect in Lebanon, Bloom program outcomes, Iraq ToT case… this signals you’re not just a charismatic facilitator, you’re evidence-minded. fileciteturn4file17turn4file8  \n\n5. **Sustainability is concrete, low-burden**  \n   - The 3-pillar sustainability plan (shared language, self-organized rounds, living repository + quarterly committee) directly addresses their “beyond the consultancy” worry without adding heavy bureaucracy. fileciteturn4file11turn4file12  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Five cons / risks (where it could be tweaked)\n\n1. **Tone occasionally a bit “big” / existential**  \n   - Phrases like “existential question” and “human work is for becoming more ourselves” are beautiful but could feel slightly intense for some reviewers. Softening the language (not the idea) would help. fileciteturn4file8turn4file16  \n\n2. **AI tech depth might intimidate non-technical reviewers**  \n   - Embeddings/attention/vector-space talk is great for your people, but a couple of lines could be simplified so HR/administrative readers don’t feel lost. fileciteturn4file16  \n\n3. **SCRIBER origin story could sound over-heroic if not gently framed**  \n   - “Developed from first principles…” is correct but could read as slightly boastful if the tone elsewhere isn’t softened. fileciteturn4file2turn4file12  \n\n4. **Document length and density**  \n   - The Technical Proposal is rich (which is good) but quite dense. A skeptical reader might skim and miss the simple headline: “2 pathways, 4 activities, 6 deliverables, all mapped to your ToR.” It may need one more summary graphic/section up front.\n\n5. **Assumes comfort with your language (growth edges, convivial tech, shadows vs self)**  \n   - These are powerful phrases, but a couple of them might need one extra plain-language line so they don’t feel like “new jargon”.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Five new questions to tighten alignment\n\nAnswering these (even roughly) will help me do a clean, aligned softening pass that still sounds like you:\n\n1. **Softening & humility:**  \n   Which 1–2 sentences feel *most* “too strong” or edgy to you in the cover letter / conclusion? (If you name them, I’ll rewrite them in your voice but 10–20% softer.)\n\n2. **AI depth vs accessibility:**  \n   On a spectrum from “keep it very accessible” to “it’s okay if it’s a bit technical, they’re the Office of Innovation,” where do you want this to land?\n\n3. **Bloom emphasis:**  \n   Do you want Bloom framed primarily as:\n   - (a) “10-year lab where these methods were tested,”  \n   - (b) “regional social-impact accelerator with UN partners,” or  \n   - (c) both?\n\n4. **What *not* to foreground:**  \n   Is there any phrase, story, or concept you feel might be “too much” for UNICEF (e.g., existential language, explicit mention of trauma, religious references) that you’d prefer we keep subtle or remove?\n\n5. **Shortest “core promise” in your words:**  \n   If you had to describe what you’re offering them in **one sentence** to a colleague inside UNICEF (not a funder), what would you say? I’ll use that as the north star line to align the whole proposal around.\n\nIf you respond to those, I can do a gentle pass that: softens language, explicitly flags “2 pathways + 4 activities,” foregrounds agency/tool-vs-assistant/peer learning/embeddings in one clean spot, and weaves Bloom in a bit earlier—while keeping it very much “you.”",

      "content": "Great, this helps a lot. Let me lock a few things in and then give you the 3 alternatives you asked for.\n\n- **Pathways:** We stick with what’s already in V2:  \n  **Pathway 1 – Humanity-Centered AI**  \n  **Pathway 2 – Leading Through Complexity**  \n  → This cleanly matches the ToR’s “technical / soft skills / management” and your own practice.\n\n- **Activities:** We’re also already aligned with the “≥ 4 activities” requirement:  \n  1. Rounds of Conversation (weekly brown bags)  \n  2. AI Foundations / SCRIBER workshop  \n  3. Management Peer Cohort  \n  4. Ethics & Reflection workshop  \n\n- **Tech level:** I’ll keep embeddings/vector space & SCRIBER in, but always explained in everyday language (map, neighborhoods, directions), not as “fancy AI stuff.”\n\n- **Tone:** I’ll soften the more “big” language so it’s still existential and values-driven but not grandiose.\n\nBelow are **3 alternative “Why this opportunity matters to me” sections** you can swap into the cover letter. All of them assume we keep mentioning Bloom, your post-traumatic growth work, and (lightly) that you’ve collaborated with UNICEF before.\n\n---\n\n### Option 1 – Post-Traumatic Growth & Learning in Crisis\n\nFor the last decade, most of my work has been in places where change is not theoretical: Lebanon during economic collapse and the Beirut explosion, Iraq in reconstruction, and across MENA with teams trying to keep going through overlapping crises. At Bloom, we didn’t just teach entrepreneurship—we built practices for staying human and creative when everything feels uncertain.\n\nMy Master’s research on post-traumatic growth showed that participants in our programs had a “buffering effect” during Lebanon’s crises. They weren’t less affected by events, but they had shared ways to process them: check-ins, growth-edge language instead of “failure,” peer support, and space to be vulnerable without losing dignity. Those practices travelled with them into their families, workplaces, and communities.\n\nThat’s why this role with UNICEF’s Office of Innovation matters to me. You’re supporting teams who are working on behalf of children in some of the toughest contexts on earth, while also navigating the upheaval of AI. I’d like to bring what we’ve learned at Bloom—about agency, trauma, and learning together in hard times—into a setting where it can support the people who support everyone else.\n\n---\n\n### Option 2 – Agency, Tool vs Assistant, and Lived AI Practice\n\nI don’t come to AI as a detached theorist. I come as someone who has spent the last years actually learning with these tools, making mistakes with them, and helping social enterprises and NGOs figure out how to use them without losing their soul.\n\nIn our “AI for Impact” workshops, we treat LLMs as maps of human knowledge, not oracles. We work with people to feel the difference between using AI as a **tool** (to see more of the landscape, to ask better questions) and outsourcing their thinking to it as an **assistant**. We talk about embeddings as “neighborhoods of meaning,” and use SCRIBER to help people see what they didn’t know they needed to see—while always looping back to their own judgment and craft.\n\nFor UNICEF’s Office of Innovation, I’m excited about a simple idea: we only teach what we have genuinely learned. I want to co-learn with your team—about AI, about your specific constraints, about what “good work” feels like here—and then design pathways, rounds of conversation, and tools that are grounded in lived experience, not generic slide decks. The goal is not just competence with AI, but a deeper sense that “these tools serve us, and serve the children we work for—not the other way around.”\n\n---\n\n### Option 3 – Ubuntu, Community, and Vulnerable Excellence\n\nMost of my facilitation work starts from a simple conviction: **we become more intelligent together than we can ever be alone**. In Bloom’s programs across 16 countries, I’ve watched what happens when people are given space to show up as whole humans—bringing their histories, their humour, their faith, their doubts—and then invited into structured, cooperative learning.\n\nWe’ve seen it with very “Type A” participants who arrive skeptical, arms crossed, unsure why we’re talking about check-ins and music and growth edges. A few days later they’re saying, “I didn’t expect this to be real, but I love that we’re stronger together.” That shift—from self-protection to shared exploration—is the heart of my work. It’s also what underlies my research on post-traumatic growth: people do better when they have communities of safety and meaning to lean on.\n\nI’ve had the chance to collaborate with UNICEF-linked initiatives before through Bloom and partner programs, and I know how deeply your teams care about the children and communities you serve. This consultancy matters to me because it sits at the intersection I care about most: ubuntu (I am because we are), craft, and technology. I’d like to help your staff protect their humanity and their sense of purpose while they learn new tools, so that the culture inside the Office of Innovation is as life-giving and resilient as the work you’re doing in the world.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me which of these feels closest, I can:\n\n- weave that version fully into the cover letter,  \n- soften any remaining “big” language in the technical proposal to match, and  \n- slot in a gentle reference to prior UNICEF collaboration without over-specifying it.",

Is there *any* concrete example we can safely name? Even one line like: “previously contributed to X UNICEF initiative in Y country/year” would anchor trust.\n\n2. **AI vs broader L&D balance:**  \n   If we imagine a pie chart of emphasis in the *cover letter* (not the technical doc), what feels right to you?  \n   - ~40% AI / 30% soft skills / 30% management, or  \n   - 33/33/33, or  \n   - Heavier on soft+management and a bit lighter on AI?\n\n3. **How comfortable are you with explicit spiritual/trauma language here?**  \n   You’ve said religious–existential & post-traumatic growth are real drivers for you. For a UNICEF proposal, do you want that:  \n   - A) lightly implied (“meaning, agency, resilience”),  \n   - B) named once with Bloom/PTG as evidence, or  \n   - C) more foregrounded?\n\n4. **Bloom positioning:**  \n   Do you want Bloom framed primarily as:  \n   - A) your “lab” and long-term learning system (1–2 sentences),  \n   - B) a central case study (short paragraph), or  \n   - C) background context with more focus on *you* as independent consultant?\n\n5. **Pathway names: keep or soften?**  \n   Are you happy keeping the current names “Humanity-Centered AI” and “Leading Through Complexity”, or would you prefer something slightly more neutral/UN-ish, like “AI Foundations for Innovators” and “Management & Collaboration in Transition”? fileciteturn5file3turn5file9  \n\nOnce you answer these, I can:\n\n- Soften the language to feel a bit less manifesto, a bit more UNICEF-human,  \n- Rebalance AI vs other skills,  \n- Keep Option 2’s structure, but make it sound even more like you talking *with* them, not at them.",

We can keep the depth but tone it down a notch. fileciteturn6file9turn6file4  \n\n2. **AI may be a bit more than 40% right now**  \n   SCRIBER, embeddings, escalator problem, AI workshops, ethics workshop, RAG… it risks feeling like an “AI programme with some L&D” rather than “L&D for an innovation office with a strong AI thread.” fileciteturn6file18turn6file6  \n\n3. **Bloom + UNICEF history are underplayed**  \n   The documents reference Bloom, but they don’t foreground: 10+ years of accelerator work, 1,000+ participants, and your direct UNICEF-linked work (Nawaya / Burj el Barajneh, Elevate accelerator) early enough. fileciteturn6file4  \n\n4. **Governance/committee bits may feel a bit “system-heavy”**  \n   Airtable + RAG + KPI dashboard + quarterly committee + surveys could read as a lot, given their time constraints.

A reviewer skimming might miss key UNICEF-specific points unless we sharpen the front matter. fileciteturn6file5turn6file18  \n\n---\n\n**5 new questions to clean and align it further**\n\n1. **How explicit do you want the AI share to be?**  \n   You said ~40% AI. Do you want us to:  \n   - (a) keep the two pathways as-is but trim some of the deep AI theory,  \n   - or (b) rebalance the examples so Pathway 2 (Leading Through Complexity) carries more non-AI content and stories?\n\n2. **Where should we surface your prior UNICEF work?**  \n   You’ve got Nawaya/Burj el Barajneh and Elevate with UNICEF. Do you want that:  \n   - in the first paragraph of the cover letter,  \n   - or as a short “Previous UNICEF collaboration” note in the Technical Proposal intro,  \n   - or both?\n\n3. **How “loud” should PTG/trauma language be?**  \n   Is your preference:  \n   - “Quietly embedded” (e.g., talk about buffering and resilience without using the words trauma/PTG much),  \n   - or “named but light” (one short paragraph explicitly mentioning your PTG research),  \n   - or “foregrounded” (a small dedicated sub-section on PTG as a design lens)?\n\n4. **What’s the softest version of your existential language that still feels true to you?**  \n   For example, would you be happy changing “existential question: what is human work for in an age of AI?” to something like “deeper question about what our work is for as AI becomes more present”? Any phrases you already know feel a bit too sharp/poetic for this audience?\n\n5. **How much of the internals (SCRIBER, embeddings, RAG) do you want in the proposal vs kept in your back pocket?**  \n   We can:  \n   - keep the high-level explanation and move detailed tech/pedagogy into an appendix,  \n   - or keep it as-is because you want them to see the depth,  \n   - or strip some details and just offer to share full framework docs “on request.”\n\nIf you answer those, I can tune the next revision so it:  \n- feels more like “you,”  \n- matches the 2-path / 4-activity requirement really explicitly,  \n- and lands right in their likely comfort zone (serious, grounded, not too grandiose).",

Just stuff you can use.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Quick review: 5 pros / 5 cons of V2\n\n**5 Pros**\n\n1. **Very strong fit to ToR:** You clearly hit 2 pathways + ≥4 activities + all 6 deliverables.  \n2. **Authentic voice:** It actually sounds like you—agency, growth edges, music, playlists, Bloom/PTG, all there.  \n3. **Concrete methodology:** SCRIBER, rounds of conversation, Airtable+RAG, management peer cohort—very tangible.  \n4. **Evidence-based:** You bring in your Master’s PTG work and Bloom’s buffering effect in crises.  \n5. **Clear sustainability plan:** Common language, self-organized rounds, quarterly governance—lightweight but real.\n\n**5 Cons / Tuning points**\n\n1. **Tone is a bit intense in places** (“existential question… shadows of themselves”)—could worry a risk-averse reader.  \n2. **Tech language occasionally heavy** (“embeddings, vector spaces, attention mechanisms”)—you want one simple explanation, not three buzzwords.  \n3. **UNICEF experience is implied but not named clearly**—you *do* have UNICEF track record, that should be explicit.  \n4. **“I don’t teach generic frameworks” sounds a touch sharp**—can be softened without losing the point.  \n5. **“What is human work for in an age of AI?” appears in strong rhetorical form**—beautiful, but softening it slightly will feel safer in a UN context.\n\nEverything below addresses these.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Softened & updated Cover Letter (V3)\n\nYou can replace your current `UNICEF_Cover_Letter_V2.md` with this:\n\n```md\n# Cover Letter\n\nDear Hiring Committee,\n\nI'm applying for the Organizational Learning Strategy and Design Consultant role with UNICEF's Office of Innovation.\n\n**Why I fit this assignment**\n\nYour team is moving through a real transition: AI is changing what skills matter, how people work together, and how “learning” shows up in daily practice. In moments like this, I’ve found that teams don’t just need more content—they need spaces to stay grounded in their humanity while they experiment with new tools.\n\nOver the last 10+ years I’ve been building learning systems in crisis and complexity: training more than 1,000 entrepreneurs across 16 countries in MENA and Africa, working with displaced communities in Lebanon, and supporting reconstruction work in Iraq. With AltCity (which later became Bloom), I co-ran the UNICEF-supported Elevate accelerator, and I helped Nawaya Network design a UNICEF-funded design thinking pilot for marginalized youth in the Burj el-Barajneh refugee camp in Beirut. \n\nMy Master’s research in Education looked at post-traumatic growth among social entrepreneurs during Lebanon’s compounding crises (economic collapse, Beirut blast, COVID). Participants in Bloom programs showed a “buffering” effect: they reported higher agency, learning, and wellbeing—not because their environments were easier, but because they had simple, shared practices for processing uncertainty together.\n\nSince 2023, a large share of my work (around 40%) has focused specifically on helping teams learn to use large language models and AI in ways that protect their agency, craft, and sense of meaning.\n\n---\n\n**How I’ll deliver your six outputs**\n\n**1. L&D Strategy & Framework**  \nI’ll begin with stakeholder interviews and a map of current assets and pain points. From there, I’ll co-design a strategy organized into three tracks:\n\n- **Technical AI literacy** (with a “humanity-centered” lens and a clear distinction between using AI as a *tool* vs as an *assistant*)  \n- **Soft skills for innovators** (using design thinking as a container for creativity, collaboration, and resilience)  \n- **Management and middle-management development** (psychological safety, feedback as “growth edges,” leading through transition)\n\nThe framework will include a simple governance charter and KPIs that focus on behavior change and practice adoption, not just attendance.\n\n**2. Consolidated Needs Assessment & Learning Plan**  \nI’ll integrate the AI Learning Survey, the Global Staff Survey, prior needs assessments, intern outputs, and the Innovation Evaluation Report into one coherent picture. The learning plan will be role-based (“If you’re a program manager, start here…”) and will show how the three tracks work together. It will be validated with the Learning Committee before implementation so it feels owned, not imposed.\n\n**3. Learning Pathways & Resources**  \nI’ll design two pathways:\n\n1. **“Humanity-Centered AI”** – an accessible pathway that introduces AI as a map of related ideas rather than a magic answer box; covers the tool vs assistant distinction, your key use cases, ethical guardrails, and convivial technology practices.  \n2. **“Leading Through Complexity”** – a pathway for managers and key staff on psychological safety, design thinking for “wicked” problems, cross-cultural facilitation, and building a sustainable learning culture.\n\nEach pathway will have 4 practical modules with exercises, worksheets, and a curated set of internal and external resources (including prompts, checklists, and reflection tools).\n\n**4. Learning Activities Delivered**  \nI’ll coordinate and facilitate at least four core activities, each feeding into the pathways and repository:\n\n- **Rounds of Conversation** – a weekly or bi-weekly brown-bag style series with rotating facilitators, opening with music and brief check-ins, focused on sharing real experiments with AI and learning practices.  \n- **AI Foundations Workshop** – a 2–2.5 hour session where people bring real tasks, learn the SCRIBER prompting framework, and practice using AI to explore what they don’t yet know they need to see—without outsourcing their thinking.  \n- **Management Peer Cohort** – three 60-minute sessions using a gentle “case clinic” format, where managers support each other’s growth edges around feedback, psychological safety, and leading through uncertainty.  \n- **Ethics & Reflection Workshop** – a closing workshop that uses stories, research, and dialogue to help the team articulate an AI use “charter” and very practical manual-fallback and bias-awareness practices.\n\nTogether, these activities create a rhythm: check-in, experiment, harvest, reflect.\n\n**5. Governance & Knowledge Management Tools**  \nI’ll set up a lightweight learning system built on tools you already know. The core is an Airtable repository with three-click access, organized by “Technical,” “Soft Skills,” and “Management,” and linked to pathway modules. On top of that, a simple search layer (RAG) can help when someone doesn’t know what to search for but remembers a conversation or theme.\n\nThe Learning Committee will meet quarterly (not monthly, to avoid overloading schedules) for focused 30-minute reviews: looking at a simple dashboard that tracks reuse of materials and observed practice changes, deciding which resources to keep, add, or quietly retire.\n\n**6. Final Report & Recommendations**  \nI’ll provide a final report that combines quantitative and qualitative evidence: KPI trends, participation data, and stories of practice change. It will include a clear sustainability plan (SOPs, a trained facilitator roster, a living backlog of learning needs) so the culture of learning can continue to evolve after the consultancy ends.\n\nMy test of success is that by June 2026, staff in the Office of Innovation can honestly say something like: *“We have simple shared practices that help us learn together, protect our agency with these tools, and stay connected to why our work for children matters.”*\n\n---\n\n**How we’ll work together**\n\nThis will be a part-time, deliverables-based engagement (around 90 working days over eight months), with more intensive time during pathway pilots and workshops. I’ll coordinate closely with your sponsor and Learning Committee, keep materials in a shared repository, and report progress against the agreed KPIs. I typically facilitate the first rounds of conversation myself, then gradually hand over to internal facilitators so the system can live comfortably inside your team.\n\n---\n\n**What makes my approach different**\n\nI don’t start from generic frameworks; I start from first principles and lived practice. I spend time understanding how tools like LLMs actually work (for example, as maps of related language and ideas) and then co-design learning experiences that protect agency, craft, and pride in work.\n\nThe SCRIBER approach I use (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/Contract, Explain, Recurse) grew out of both the technical realities of these models and many hours of working with teams who were anxious about AI but curious. We experiment together, keep what feels life-giving, and discard what doesn’t.\n\nIn cross-cultural settings, I pay close attention to dignity and vulnerability. In Iraq, for example, I noticed that “asking for help” felt risky, especially in public. So instead of asking people to list their weaknesses, we reframed everything as “growth edges,” started with dyads and triads, and had people work on each other’s challenges first. By the end of one Mosul training, a very Type-A participant who had been skeptical said, “I didn’t expect this to be real, but I love that I’m sharing and connecting with these other teams—we really are stronger together.”\n\nMy Master’s work on post-traumatic growth, and my consulting in conflict-affected contexts, continuously remind me that technical skills and human wellbeing are not separate tracks. Simple practices—check-ins, peer support, reframing setbacks—can make a real difference in how people show up to their work.\n\n---\n\n**Why this opportunity matters to me**\n\nI believe people are naturally creative, collaborative, and connected to deep sources of wisdom. As AI becomes more present in daily work, there’s a real risk that we quietly lower our expectations of ourselves and show up as smaller versions of who we are—repeating the past instead of exploring what’s possible.\n\nWorking with UNICEF’s Office of Innovation is a chance to do the opposite: to help a diverse, values-driven team use new tools in a way that deepens their capacity to serve children, strengthens their sense of community, and protects their humanity in the process.\n\nI would be glad to support you in designing and launching this learning system.\n\nWarm regards,  \n**Bilal Ghalib**\n\nEmail: bilal@bloom.pm / bg@bilalghalib.com  \nPhone: +1 478 227 2253\n\n---\n\n**Attachments:**\n- Technical Proposal (detailed methodology and timeline)  \n- Financial Offer ($36,000 for 90 days, deliverables-based)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Replace Section 1: PURPOSE & APPROACH\n\nReplace your current Section 1 with:\n\n```md\n## 1. PURPOSE & APPROACH\n\nUNICEF's Office of Innovation is navigating an important transition. AI is beginning to reshape how teams work, what skills matter, and how learning happens across the organization. In this context, a learning strategy needs to do more than offer new tools—it needs to help people experiment safely, stay grounded in their values, and keep a clear sense of purpose in their work for children.\n\nThis proposal outlines a practical, values-driven learning system that supports three interconnected needs:\n\n1. **Technical literacy** that remains accessible and protects agency (AI as a helpful tool, not a replacement for thinking)  \n2. **Adaptive leadership** for navigating complexity, uncertainty, and change  \n3. **Sustainable practices** that can continue and evolve after this engagement ends\n\n**Core Philosophy:** Learning works best when it is embodied (connected to real tasks), relational (done with others, not alone), and meaningful (linked to why the work matters). Large language models can help people notice more, see new possibilities, and work more creatively—or, if used uncritically, they can leave people feeling disconnected from their own judgment and craft. The way we design the learning environment makes the difference.\n\nI approach this work by:\n\n- Starting from **first principles** about how these tools function (for example, as maps of related language and ideas rather than magic answer boxes)  \n- Designing experiences that invite **curiosity, reflection, and co-creation**, not just consumption  \n- Building in **simple, repeatable practices** (check-ins, growth-edge language, peer support) that teams can use long after the consultancy ends\n```\n\n### 3.2. Soften the “existential question” conclusion & add explicit UNICEF experience\n\nReplace your current CONCLUSION section (near the end) with this version:\n\n```md\n## CONCLUSION\n\nUNICEF's Office of Innovation is asking an honest question, even if it is not always spoken out loud: how do we keep human work meaningful in a time when AI can do so much of the “doing”?\n\nThis proposal offers a practical way to explore that question together. It combines two pathways (Humanity-Centered AI and Leading Through Complexity), at least four core learning activities, a living repository, and a light but real governance structure. The aim is not perfection in eight months, but a noticeable shift in how people learn together, support one another, and use new tools with confidence and care.\n\nI bring over a decade of experience helping people learn in difficult conditions: entrepreneurs in conflict zones, displaced communities, and teams navigating compound crises. With AltCity/Bloom, I co-ran the UNICEF-supported Elevate accelerator and helped design a UNICEF-funded design thinking pilot with Nawaya Network for marginalized youth in the Burj el-Barajneh refugee camp in Beirut. My work in Iraq, with UNESCO and the International Trade Centre, has reinforced how important it is to respect local culture, avoid one-size-fits-all models, and build sustainability from the first day.\n\n**If this consultancy goes well, I hope that in June 2026 a staff member in the Office of Innovation might say something like:**\n\n> “We’ve found a shared language for learning together. We understand these tools more clearly, we’re kinder to ourselves and each other in transitions, and we feel more able to bring our real perspectives and experiences into the work. The tools are helping us, but they’re not speaking for us.”\n\nThis is not just a learning strategy document; it is an invitation to keep human agency, dignity, and creativity at the center while technology evolves.\n\nI would be honoured to support UNICEF’s Office of Innovation in this work.\n\n---\n\n**Bilal Ghalib**  \nCo-Founder, Bloom | Curriculum Consultant, UN ITC  \nMaster's in Learning Sciences, Université de Paris  \nIslam & Psychology, Cambridge Muslim College  \n\nEmail: bilal@bloom.pm / bg@bilalghalib.com  \nPhone: +1 478 227 2253\n```\n\n### 3.3. Make the tech explanation more accessible (SCRIBER section tweak)\n\nIn your **Pathway 1 / SCRIBER** part (Section 2), swap the “embeddings / vector space” bullet with this softer wording:\n\n```md\nThe basic insight I share with participants is that **LLMs store patterns of language and meaning in a kind of “map” of related ideas**. When you prompt them, you’re walking around that map. Most people have never been shown this, so they treat AI like a search box: ask one question, accept the first answer. Once they see the “map” metaphor, they can use AI to explore what is around their question, not only what sits directly in front of it.\n```\n\nYou can then keep your five-bullet explanation, but if you want to soften further, adjust this line:\n\n- From: “Treat the model as a map, not an oracle.”  \n- To: “Treat the model as a map to explore with, not an oracle to obey.”\n\n### 3.4. Add explicit UNICEF reference into “Grounded in Evidence”\n\nIn Section “10. WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS” under **Grounded in Evidence**, add one more bullet:\n\n```md\n- Previously collaborated with UNICEF through:\n  - The Elevate accelerator (run with AltCity/Bloom and UNICEF)\n  - A UNICEF-funded design thinking pilot with Nawaya Network for marginalized youth in Burj el-Barajneh refugee camp (Beirut)\n```\n\nYou can place it right after the “Tested with 1,000+ entrepreneurs…” bullet.\n\n---\n\nThat’s it.  \n\nIf you paste the new Cover Letter and patch those few sections in the Technical Proposal, you’ll have:\n\n- Softer, more “UN-safe” (in a good way) language  \n- Clearer UNICEF track record  \n- Accessible tech explanations  \n- Still very much *you*—agency, ubuntu, craft, growth edges, and all.",
