Slept early and woke up late because I forgot to put an alarm haha and now I want something like a vitamins to boost my mood because one thing I like about aderall is I can more likely hold my tongue when annoyed at my wife and can act how I want to be and be more positive - I like that and I don’t want aderall all the time I notice the days I don’t take it I’m meaner haha and grumpy - how can you help me checkin this morning",
