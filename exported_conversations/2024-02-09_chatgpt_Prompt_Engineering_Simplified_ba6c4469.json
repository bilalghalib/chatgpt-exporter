Task: As a consultant with expertise in environmental impacts, specifically wastewater treatment, your goal is to edit and enhance the report. The aim is to make the report compelling and persuasive, advocating for the treatment of wastewater outfall into a river. Instructions: Evaluation Criteria: Start by establishing the criteria you'll use to review the report. Consider clarity, persuasiveness, data accuracy, solution viability, and environmental impact understanding. Step-by-Step Review Process: Assessment: Analyze the current state of the report. Identify areas of strength that support the project’s goals and areas of weakness that require improvement. Refinement Ideas: Propose specific edits and improvements. This could include reorganizing content for better flow, enhancing arguments with additional data, clarifying technical descriptions, and suggesting new sections that could strengthen the report's persuasive power. Presentation Enhancements: Offer suggestions on how to make the report more accessible and compelling to government officials. This might involve visual aids, executive summaries, and clear articulation of benefits to both the environment and the community. Editing Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations for each section of the report. Prioritize changes that would significantly enhance the persuasive quality of the document. Context: The report is in a preliminary draft stage and needs both cosmetic and substantive edits to be deemed professional and convincing. The ultimate goal is to secure government approval for the proposed wastewater treatment project, making a positive impact on the river's environmental health. Parameters: Focus: Emphasize precision, persuasiveness, and professional integrity in your recommendations. Length and Format: Detail your findings and suggestions concisely within an 800-word limit.

      "content": "The document \"PromptTips.txt\" outlines key concepts for creating effective AI prompts, emphasizing the importance of clarity and structure. It highlights that prompts are the medium of interaction between humans and AI, and can take various forms like text, images, and audio. Effective prompts consist of four components: task (the goal for the AI), instructions (details on format, length, style, content), context (background information to aid AI understanding), and parameters (settings to adjust system behavior). It also introduces the concept of 'prompt engineering', which involves decomposing tasks into components, crafting and testing recipes, determining optimal recipes, and storing successful ones in a library. This structured approach enhances AI performance by clearly communicating user intent, thereby minimizing trial and error and saving resources. \n\nApplying these insights, the environmental report review prompt can be improved by clearly defining the task, giving specific instructions, providing relevant context, and setting clear parameters for the review process.",
