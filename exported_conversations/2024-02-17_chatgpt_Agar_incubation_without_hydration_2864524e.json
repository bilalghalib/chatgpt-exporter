      "content": "After placing spore prints onto a sterilized agar dish, you should follow these steps for proper incubation:\n\n1. **Location:** Place the agar dish in an environment with a stable temperature suitable for the specific type of fungi you are cultivating. This is usually around 70-75°F (21-24°C) for many common mushroom species. The location should be dark or have indirect light, as direct sunlight can be harmful.\n\n2. **Humidity and Hydration:** Agar medium typically contains enough moisture for the initial growth of mycelium, so you don't need to add extra liquid. However, maintaining a humid environment is crucial. You can achieve this by placing the dishes in a larger container like a plastic box (still air box) with a damp paper towel to maintain humidity, but don't let water directly touch the agar.\n\n3. **Timeframe:** The waiting period depends on the type of mushroom and environmental conditions. Typically, you will start to see mycelial growth within several days to a week. Full colonization can take anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks or more.\n\n4. **Observation:** Regularly check for signs of growth and contamination. Healthy mycelium usually appears as white, thread-like structures spreading across the agar. If you notice any unusual colors or odors, it could indicate contamination.\n\nRemember, a sterile technique is crucial throughout this process to prevent contamination. Keep the dishes sealed and handle them as little as possible, preferably in a clean, draft-free area.",
