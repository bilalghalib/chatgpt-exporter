It's kind of large, I'd say it's about like the size of my palm. The stem doesn't have the whole skirt thing, that's why it's called a spike. It's an autumn mushroom here in Nile, France. It's mid-September. It has kind of a grayish top that goes gray kind of in the center, but a little bit more pale, light-colored white on the outside.",

      "content": "Got it — let’s slow this down and go step by step with the details you shared:  \n\n- **Cap**: Grayish, darker in the center, paler toward the edges. Has an **umbo** (raised bump in the middle). Size: about palm-sized.  \n- **Gills**: **Pink** in color.  \n- **Stem**: No ring/skirt.  \n- **Texture**: “Wet” or moist appearance.  \n- **Season/Location**: Mid-September, northern France (Nîmes/Nîle?).  \n\nThat combination — **pink gills, moist appearance, no ring, greyish cap with umbo** — makes me think first of the **Entoloma** genus (often called pinkgills). They’re notorious because they have pink spores (so the gills mature pink), don’t have a ring, and many have grayish, umbonate caps.  \n\n⚠️ **Caution**: Most Entolomas are toxic, some dangerously so (like *Entoloma sinuatum*, the livid pinkgill). They’re large, grey to pale caps with pinkish gills as they mature, no ring, found in autumn. The features you describe match this very closely.  \n\nThe “spike” you mentioned — could you mean *Tricholoma* (often called “knights” or “spikes” in French/English)? If so, that’s another group, but **Tricholomas have white spores and white gills, not pink**, so the pink gills rule them out.  \n\nSo right now, best guess: **Entoloma sp.** (likely *E. sinuatum* if it’s large, grayish, autumn, France).  \n\n👉 Next things to check if you want to narrow it down:  \n- **Spore print color**: If it’s salmon-pink, that confirms Entoloma.  \n- **Smell**: *E. sinuatum* often smells mealy (like flour or cucumber).  \n- **Gills attachment**: Entolomas often have gills that notch into the stem (“sinuate”).  \n- **Habitat**: Was it under broadleaf trees (oak, beech, hornbeam)? That would fit *E. sinuatum*.  \n\n⚠️ But bottom line: if it’s Entoloma, it is **not edible and can be poisonous**.  \n\nWould you like me to give you a clear **comparison chart** (Entoloma vs. Tricholoma vs. Clitocybe) so you can rule out other lookalikes systematically?",

      "content": "Ah, that’s really helpful! If you’re thinking **Deer Shield** (*Pluteus cervinus*), let’s check it carefully against what you saw:  \n\n### Pluteus cervinus (Deer Shield) features\n- **Cap**: Brown to grey-brown, often darker in the center, paler at the edge. Smooth, sometimes slightly sticky when wet. Can be palm-sized.  \n- **Umbo**: Sometimes present, though not always strong.  \n- **Gills**: Start whitish, then turn **pinkish** as spores mature. Free from the stem (they don’t attach).  \n- **Stem**: Whitish, fibrous, no ring.  \n- **Spore print**: Pinkish.  \n- **Season**: Spring to autumn, often found in **forests on decaying wood** (but the wood can be buried, so it may look like it’s growing from soil).  \n- **Edibility**: Generally considered edible but not highly prized — and sometimes causes gastric upset in sensitive people.  \n\n### Why it might match your find\n- You saw **pink gills** (fits).  \n- **No skirt/ring** on stem (fits).  \n- **Greyish cap with umbo** (fits).  \n- Palm-sized, autumn, France (fits the habitat/season).  \n\n### Key check to confirm\nThe main difference between **Pluteus (Deer Shield)** and **Entoloma (Livid Pinkgill)** is the **gill attachment**:  \n- *Pluteus*: gills are **free** (don’t touch the stem).  \n- *Entoloma*: gills are **sinuate/notched** (they curve into the stem).  \n\n👉 If you tilt the mushroom and see a tiny gap where the gills stop just short of the stem = Pluteus.  \n👉 If the gills run into the stem and form a notch = Entoloma.  \n\n⚠️ This is super important because one is “edible-but-meh” and the other is **seriously poisonous**.  \n\nDo you want me to make you a **side-by-side photo/diagram guide** of Entoloma vs Pluteus so you can check your mushroom against it clearly?",

      "content": "Thanks for the photos — that clears things up a lot.  \n\nThis is **not** a Deer Shield (*Pluteus cervinus*). Here’s why:  \n\n- The underside clearly shows **pores, not gills**. You can see a sponge-like layer, typical of **boletes**. Pluteus always has gills, never pores.  \n- The stem is thick, fibrous, and patterned/scaly, which is also consistent with boletes.  \n- The cap is large, brown, and cracking with age — again, bolete characteristics.  \n\n### What it likely is:\nThis looks like a **Leccinum species** (sometimes called rough-stemmed boletes).  \n- The stem shows the dark scabers/scales that are diagnostic of **Leccinum**.  \n- Common in France under birch, poplar, oak depending on the species.  \n- Edibility varies — some Leccinum are edible when well-cooked, but others can cause gastric upset in some people, especially when old or undercooked.  \n\n### Why not Deer Shield / Entoloma\n- Both of those have **gills** (pink in Entoloma, free and pinkish in Pluteus).  \n- Your mushroom has **pores** (sponge layer), so it sits in the bolete group, not the gilled mushroom group.  \n\n---\n\n👉 So your find is a **large, mature bolete — probably a Leccinum (“scaber stalk”)**.  \n- The rough stem is the giveaway.  \n- The cap color and size are in range for *Leccinum scabrum* (birch bolete) or *Leccinum aurantiacum* group (orange cap, but older specimens can look browner).  \n\n⚠️ Note: With boletes, always check:  \n- **Pore color changes** (blue-staining or not).  \n- **Tree association** (birch, oak, poplar nearby).  \n- **Spore print** (though less often used for boletes).  \n\nWould you like me to help you **narrow which Leccinum species** this is (based on trees nearby + color changes when cut), or are you more interested in the **edibility/safety** side?",
