      "content": "i want help thinking about and making a python script that has a flask server and ollama backend. it should talk to me as an LLM chatbot and should have a place to save a system prompt and other variables, it should mantain a chat history so it can develop a conversation record and importantly it should build a theory of mind of the person in the framing of a Johari window - so things they disclose and know about themselves things you know about them based on inference things others know that they might now and things that are totally in their blind spots. We want to represent this in an easy way to visualize so they can see their self representation being developed as the conversation grows. what i'd like to do is help them be able to see what you think their goals/intentions are so clicking into \"what's known to the LLM\" which includes your theory of mind of the person - this is the place where the LLM is working from to help them as their assisstant and is brought into the context every time the LLM responds so we need to develop a system prompt that includes referncing the theory of mind before responding. can you think with me about this idea and come up with a plan I'd like to come up with a 3 page document describing this idea and the model clearly, and why we want to do it and how it can inform how LLMs should interact with people in the future, yet I need you to first summarize your understanding and then ask me 5 questions to clarify my thinking and deepen the concept"

      "content": "it should be done in every cycle where the llm will have another process to have each element of the Theory Of Mind be represented as a detective exploring the conversation so far and especially the new information and hunt for clues or examples that it can use in it's representation. my question is besides theory of mind are there any other things we might want to build detectives for? is there a better word than a \"detective\" agent - perhaps we need to design this modularly and systematically so we can have a detectives file with names where we add the concepts, the elements of the concept, and the detective question system prompt. It should be mostly implicit although if they request to update the systems representation they should be able to clarity alter improve or add informationto any of the elements. how should the UI or UX (perhaps they need a mad libs style menue where the prompt is explicit and asks for the LLM to update based on a clear prompt structure, not sure if this is a good idea or if it it'll work). 1. it should focus on their values and sources of meaning, beliefs, goals, knowledge, and emotions - how can we help people understand themselves so we can help them do things that will help them find satisfaction and pride in their lives. a life well lived of flourishing. 2. there should be a way for a user to ask to see the theory of mind in a clear way, and to ask which elements are influencing the current conversation. 3. the information is stored in the users computer and they can delete it - the local LLM also helps with that. 4. it should be a showcase demonstrating what LLMs could be like in the future. Some other ideas is that for each element in the models representation of the user it should have the representation, the evidence it pulls from the conversation and the evidence it has from it's implicit understanding and guesses, a confidence score representing how strongly it believes it has good quality evidence for that element, and questions it has about that element that would help it improve its confidence, as well as questions for how the user might improve, deepen, widen, or benefit in this element for their flourishing or for their goal objectives. I also wonder if we might benefit from a LLM defined \"panel of experts\": people who know how best to help the user based on their goals, intentions, values, knowledge and beliefs who are one or a few steps a head who can then offer advice, critique, or suggestsions, they can be generated as the conversation goes on and as their \"conversation pressure\" meaning how much they feel like they want to talk can show up in a side bar and the user can click on them when they want to get an alternative perspective, and they can also be modeled in a similar way to the elements in the theory of mind and or other measures with their perspective, their confidence, their questions for improving confidence, and their questions for the user"

One importnat thing to know is that learning is fun and becoming is good so the user should have a sense of \"wow, this is big, good, important, and i feel expanded ina. good way\""

I'd also add to the problem statement of the philosophy paper that LLMs don't have opinions on what the good life is and don't guide people towards it, they just do what they say and help people based on where they are. In a world of inquality where people are more and less exposed and don't know what to google to grow become or what is even possible - they would need great mentors, or educated parents, when they don't have that people's visions on whats posisble for them in lfie is constrained and this system can help expand that by bringing their goals into view and helping expand the possibility space in the embeddings around it and to help guide people to what they might rather do if they could only see - how can we include this concept better? where might it already fit in our system"

      "content": "1. I wonder what you would say would be the mosaic elements that would be most essential in helping model the conciousness hofstadter - i think having the meta model process the situation and then have a view on itself with a specialzed meta question - who am i and what am i doing or something along those lines - with a set of values - maybe something like a gradual series of stronger and more permanent objects of selfhood - feeings are fleeting, knowledge is semi permanent till they're updated, and then finally beliefs about the self and at the top are our values and sources of meaning that are metastable and require disruptions to fundamental schemas beliefs goals and life narratives before they change. 2. yes, since we're dealing with an LLM with a token count we will get what we get and it's all a bit gooey and fuzzy and not hyper concrete, usefulness in terms of the person feeling the positive aspects of growth, progress, becoming, aha of new insights, seeing in the dark spaces of things they are not exposed to yet benefit from would be a good measure of good enough - and the infinite loop would be necessarily closed due to cost and token count and we could optimize for our variables. 3. it aligns really well with frames and can benefit from the idea of object files - we can consider each agent as containing a set of frames. 4. we don't really want self-awareness, we want the person to be come self aware so the intentionality should always be flipped towards the person. 5. thank spiaget, I think there's a way of thinking that using a tool like this can indeed support mental complexity. 6. sure, what do you think is a good minimum maximum level of scaffolding that doesn't take too much away from the users ability to grow on their own? 7. kagen: by helping them see themselves through the lense of another - talking to experts who are one step ahead perhaps helps them see what's possible in becoming. 8. yes, how would you help them towards self authorship - which parts of the system do you think need to be tuned or changed?"

Right now the LLM takes away agency by doing things for us. I think if the person feels the surprise and positivity of aha, hope, optimism, the Positive learning emotions include **interest, curiosity, wonder, passion, creativity, engagement and joy**. These activate the reward system of the brain, make the experience desirable, and aid in focus and attention I think we can try to measure some of this as well as flourishing measures that change over time in the PERMA model. it should focus on modeling and assissting the user and its self reflection is just to be able to update the model and create a list of good questions. The other thing that distinguishes it from an LLM is that instead of waiting for the user all the time if there is a burning question it can ask it after providing a response"
