      "content": "Make me an Etsy listing post from the following text. From northern Iraq there is a wild pistachio tree that the locals call the Qazwan tree. Q-A-Z-W-A-N. This tree is used to make a rosary, otherwise known as a remembrance beads chain that Muslims call a zikr bead. T-H-I-K-R. These beads remind us that in the Muslim tradition, the entire natural world is in the constant worship of God, and that we can remember our place in the natural order of things and join them all. Whether you have faith or not, these beads represent a beautiful place in the world, a beautiful people, the Kurdish people, and a beautiful act to connect with something natural and real, and to use it as a reminder to become present. We have two types, one long and one short. Each of them will look different because they have their natural differences in seed size and shape. I hope you enjoy these beads.",
