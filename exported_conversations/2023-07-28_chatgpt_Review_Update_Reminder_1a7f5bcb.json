But the fragrance is not what I have in mind.\n\nJudy! sorry to hear that, we know it's quite hard to buy oils without smelling them first and I believe that you purchased before we made the opportunity of purchasing samples. I am sending you a 50% refund to help make your experience with us better. We want to make it easy and fun to shop with us - even when you have to shop \"smell blind\"! Please let me know if we can make your experience better and if you like our shop, an updated review helps others know about your experience!\nDate:\n10 hours ago 9:12pm EDT\nJudy Tsao Message:Thank you. Really appreciate the customer service.\nDate:\n5 hours ago\n\nShe seemed to appreciate us yet she didn't update the review, maybe we can remind her it's possible to update? What do you think is a nice non pushy response",

This could help future customers make informed decisions.\n\nBut please don't feel obligated to do so - we genuinely appreciate the time you've taken to engage with us and your overall support of our store.\n\nThank you once again, Judy.
