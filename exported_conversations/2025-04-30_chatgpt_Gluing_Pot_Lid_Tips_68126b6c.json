You're reattaching the **plastic knob to the glass lid**, and it looks like:\n\n- The screw or bolt that held the knob is missing or broken.\n- You’re considering gluing the knob directly onto the glass.\n\n### Here’s the safest and most effective approach:\n\n#### **1. Best option: Replace the screw or bolt**\nIf the original screw/bolt is still usable or can be replaced:\n- This is far stronger and more heat-safe than glue.\n- Check if a small **M4 or M5 bolt and washer** can fit through the hole to re-secure the knob.\n\n#### **2. If gluing is the only option**\n- Do **not** use regular silicone sealant (like Bostik Cest Malin). It’s **not strong enough** for a load-bearing joint and may degrade with heat.\n  \n**Instead, use:**\n- **High-temp epoxy**, such as **J-B Weld High Heat** or **Loctite Glass Glue** (if designed for plastic-to-glass bonds).\n- Make sure it says:  \n  - **Heat resistant to at least 120–150°C (preferably 200°C+)**  \n  - **Bonds glass and plastic**\n\n#### **3. Surface prep is critical:**\n- **Clean both surfaces** with rubbing alcohol.\n- **Roughen** the plastic surface slightly with sandpaper for better grip.\n- Apply the adhesive and clamp or hold tightly for at least a few hours.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help picking a specific glue available in France or online.",

      "content": "You're absolutely right—the **bolt is still there**, and yes, I now see the **broken plastic socket** in both knob halves. Thanks for pointing that out.\n\n### Here's the good news:\nSince the bolt is present and **the knob doesn't touch food**, you're mainly dealing with:\n- **Moderate heat exposure** (steam, not direct flame)\n- **Minimal weight-bearing** (just lifting the lid)\n\n### So, what’s the worst that can happen using silicone like Bostik?\n- **It might not hold well long-term**, especially if steam softens the bond.\n- The knob might eventually come off again.\n- You’ll need to **reapply** or **replace the knob** if it fails.\n\nBut **nothing dangerous** will happen. It’s not toxic if cured, and it won’t melt—just weaken over time.\n\n### If you want a quick-and-easy fix:\n- **Use the silicone** you have, apply generously around the bolt and broken socket.\n- Let it cure **at least 24 hours**.\n- It might last for months, especially if you’re careful lifting the lid.\n\n### For a longer-term fix:\n- Use **high-temp epoxy** or **replace the knob** entirely (many universal replacement knobs exist online for €5–10).\n\nWould you like links to replacement knobs or high-temp epoxy options?",

Mix epoxy well and **apply around the bolt** and inside the broken plastic socket.\n4. Clamp or hold in place **at least 30 minutes**, preferably let it **cure 24 hours** before use.\n\nAs long as you’re not using this lid in an oven or under very high heat, **your regular epoxy should work just fine**.\n\nWant tips for shaping or reinforcing the bond while it sets?",

Clean and dry all surfaces (especially glass and plastic).\n2. Mold Sugru around the **bolt area and inside the broken knob** to fill gaps.\n3. Press the knob onto the lid, adjusting position carefully.\n4.

      "content": "Thanks for sharing! This glue, **Cyanolit Koltout Express**, is actually a **very good candidate** for your pot lid knob repair. Here's a breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **What it is:**\n- A **high-performance polymer adhesive**, often referred to as an **MS polymer** or **hybrid glue**.\n- Designed for **strong, flexible, durable bonds**.\n- Works on a wide range of surfaces: **glass, metal, plastic, wood, ceramic, etc.**\n- Stays **slightly flexible after curing**, which helps absorb thermal expansion and minor shocks.\n\n---\n\n### **Pros for your use:**\n- **Good heat resistance**: These hybrid glues typically withstand **up to 120–150°C**, which is **sufficient for steam and stovetop use**.\n- **Fills gaps** well, ideal for broken or uneven surfaces.\n- **No mixing**, easy to apply, and **fast grab**.\n- **Safe once cured**, and since it’s not in contact with food, you’re good.\n\n---\n\n### **Instructions (from the tube and best practice):**\n1. **Clean** both the glass and the plastic knob well (rubbing alcohol is ideal).\n2. Apply glue **around the bolt and into the broken socket area**.\n3. Press and hold in place firmly for a minute or two.\n4. **Let cure 12 hours minimum** before use (24 hours best for full strength).\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict:**  \nYes—**this is one of your best options** at home. It’s stronger and neater than silicone, easier than epoxy, and better suited for your case than neoprene glue.\n\nWould you like help shaping it for a cleaner, reinforced grip?",
