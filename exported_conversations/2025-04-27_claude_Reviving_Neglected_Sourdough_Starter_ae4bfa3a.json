      "content": "I left my sourdough for three weeks. Is there anything I can do to revive it? It grew a weird colored liquid, like a purple liquid on top. I poured out the purple liquid and scraped off the kind of bluish purple looking flour dough that was on the top. It still smells kind of sour and nice. I added more flour, but maybe I should add some sugar to help speed up the reaction. Does that make sense? What can I do to help revive and liven up my sourdough?",

      "content": " You're dealing with a common sourdough situation that's similar to reviving a neglected garden - it needs careful attention but isn't necessarily a lost cause.\n\nThe purple liquid you saw was \"hooch,\" an alcohol byproduct that develops when your starter gets hungry. The blue/purple mold is more concerning, as mold (unlike hooch) indicates potential contamination.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\n1. First, verify there's no more visible mold. If there is, it's safer to start over as mold can grow microscopically throughout the starter.\n\n2. If you're confident you've removed all mold, take a small portion from the middle of your starter (about a tablespoon) - this area is less likely to be contaminated.\n\n3. Mix this with 50g fresh flour and 50g room temperature water in a clean container.\n\n4. Feed it every 12 hours with equal weights of flour and water (discard half before each feeding).\n\n5. Watch for signs of life - bubbles, pleasant sour smell, consistent rise and fall.\n\nDon't add sugar - that's not necessary and may encourage the wrong microorganisms. Sourdough thrives on the complex carbohydrates in flour.\n\nIf after 3-4 days you don't see activity, or if there's any off smell (garbage, nail polish remover, etc.), it's best to start fresh. Sometimes even our best revival efforts can't overcome significant contamination.",
