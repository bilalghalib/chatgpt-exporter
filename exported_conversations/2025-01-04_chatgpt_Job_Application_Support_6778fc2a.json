I want you to figure out, like, what about this document you already know about me, and start filling in all of the questions that you can already answer on your own. And I want you to help me answer all of these questions in a way that would make me really stand out in this application by, you know, interrogating me about my past, about my qualities. And if I don't give a great answer, maybe you can ask me, like, based on your understanding. I'm sure there's some way of framing or spinning things so that I actually can give you more insights. You know, I have had a very diverse life from running a music venue and art gallery in college and a screen printing business and being an entrepreneur since I was in high school with my graphic design business and all of these various things that I've done. And, you know, I'm the co-founder of Bloom.pm, an entrepreneurship support organization based out of Lebanon. And, you know, there's a lot of things that I've done. I'm sure there's a way of framing this and spinning this. You know, we've worked with UN organizations and EU and other organizations as Bloom. And also more recently I've been the international trade center consultant developing a curriculum. I have a master's degree from the University of Paris in learning sciences and pedagogy and education. I also have a bachelor's in computer science and I have a technical background. I used to have a robotics company and I helped support hackerspaces and makerspaces and, you know, innovation processes. And I'm a design thinking trainer. I've done a lot. So I'm sure there's a lot that from, you know, knowing Bilal, Galib and whatever shows up on the Internet and Bloom.pm and knowing that I'm the co-founder of Bloom.pm and whatever else is out there. I'm sure there's a lot of the questions that you can already answer. And otherwise, I want you to ask me them one at a time so that we can have a conversational style where you sort of nudge and direct me to answer the questions in the best way possible so that we have the highest likelihood of getting this job. Are you ready? When you're ready, I'll paste the thing and then respond with all of the answers filled out as best as you can. And then we'll go through the ones where you need more information one at a time. And you'll just respond with, are you ready? And then I'll open up the conversation and go.

lens on mental health and well-being support for entrepreneurs, which can differentiate UNICEF’s approach globally.  \n5. **Results-Driven**: Clear deliverables and measurable outcomes align with UNICEF’s standards, maximizing the likelihood of successful resource mobilization and stakeholder engagement.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis project plan lays out a month-by-month roadmap through December 2025, aligned with each deliverable in the Terms of Reference. Bilal’s role is central, leveraging his rich background to deliver a comprehensive, innovative entrepreneurship support system for Generation Unlimited (GenU) and the Egypt Country Office, culminating in a robust and scalable global entrepreneurship strategy for UNICEF.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps**  \n1. Finalize any outstanding details (e.g., exact number of knowledge products).  \n2. Confirm key milestones and sign-off points with UNICEF/GenU.  \n3. Begin Phase 0 onboarding activities in January 2025.  \n\nIf any clarification or adjustments are needed, we can iterate further to ensure a smooth and impactful engagement.",

      "content": "Based on everything you’ve shared—your extensive, multi-regional experience, the depth of your entrepreneurial expertise, and the senior-level strategic deliverables you would be responsible for—charging a day rate of **USD 300–400** is well within a reasonable range. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Benchmarking Against Annual Salaries**  \n   - The TOR outlines a consultant salary range of **\\$31,500–\\$160,500** annually, with an average of around **\\$99,275**.  \n   - If you assume a typical consultancy schedule of around **20 working days/month**, a **\\$300/day** rate translates to about **\\$6,000/month** or **\\$72,000/year**—somewhat below the midpoint of the stated average.  \n   - A **\\$400/day** rate brings you closer to **\\$8,000/month** or **\\$96,000/year**, which is near the average.\n\n2. **Level of Effort and Seniority**  \n   - You’re not just delivering “routine” tasks; your scope involves strategic design, high-level stakeholder engagement, curriculum development, and multi-country project management.   \n   - Typically, experts with a blend of **technical (software, robotics), entrepreneurial (Bloom, GEMSI), and design thinking** skill sets command a premium.  \n   - Your field experience in fragile contexts and proven success in **partnership-building** with UN agencies, EU donors, and grassroots organizations also adds unique value.\n\n3. **Market Comparisons**  \n   - Senior consultants in international development or innovation ecosystems can range from **\\$250 up to \\$800+** per day, depending on specialization, geographic focus, and the complexity of the assignment.  \n   - Your rate falls comfortably into the mid-range, reflecting your broad background yet remaining cost-effective for UNICEF.\n\n4. **Additional Costs and Overheads**  \n   - Make sure to confirm whether this day rate includes incidentals like **travel, lodging, insurance**, etc., or if UNICEF covers those separately.  \n   - If you’re expected to provide your own specialized software or cover certain admin costs, factor those in to avoid underquoting.\n\n**Recommendation**  \n- A **\\$300–\\$400/day** rate looks reasonable given your background and the scope of this consultancy. If you foresee significant travel or added responsibilities beyond what’s outlined, you could position yourself at the higher end (e.g., **\\$400/day**).  \n- You might also wish to clarify with UNICEF how many days per month they anticipate you working. If the workload is intense (e.g., full-time equivalent), the total compensation should reflect that effort.\n\nIn sum, **\\$300–\\$400/day** is justified by your expertise and well-aligned with the TOR’s overall salary indications. Adjust accordingly if project demands or overheads increase.",

Swap in your actual daily rate (e.g., \\$300–\\$400) and estimated days per deliverable.*  \n> *You can also remove or combine certain phases/deliverables if you prefer a simpler presentation.*\n\n---\n\n## **2. Total Lump-Sum**\n\n- **Total Lump-Sum (Professional Fees)**: \\${{ your_total }}  \n  (This equals your sum of all deliverables + any contingency buffer.)\n\nIf UNICEF requests an exact figure (without a contingency line), you can simply provide the total of the deliverables. Make sure to clarify if you are open to adjusting based on final negotiations or additional travel days.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Travel & DSA (Daily Subsistence Allowance)**\n\n- **Travel Costs**: (If the TOR confirms required travel, list estimates here. For example:)  \n  - **Roundtrip flight** (Paris → Cairo / etc.): \\${{ amount }}  \n  - **Hotel & Meals** (\\${{ daily DSA }} × estimated nights): \\${{ total_DSA }}  \n- **Total Travel and DSA**: \\${{ sum_of_above }}\n\nIf you’re **not** certain of travel needs or the TOR states “travel costs will be covered by UNICEF,” you can simply note “N/A or covered by UNICEF as per TOR.”\n\n---\n\n## **4. Other Estimated Costs**\n\n1. **Visa Fees**: \\${{ cost_if_applicable }}  \n2. **Health Insurance**: Indicate whether you already have coverage in place (e.g., “I have an active global health insurance plan; no additional cost needed” or “Estimated \\${{ x }} monthly”).  \n3. **Living Costs**: If you’re working remotely from your current location, typically these are not itemized. If relocation is needed, add a small line item.\n\n> *If you have no additional overhead beyond your daily rate, you can note “No extra costs anticipated beyond professional fees.”*\n\n---\n\n## **5. Availability**\n\n- **Earliest Start Date**: Provide a precise date (e.g., January 10, 2025) or note if flexible.  \n- **Days/Hours per Week**: (If requested) Indicate if you are available full-time or if you expect to dedicate a certain percentage of your schedule.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Summary Statement**\n\n> _I, **Bilal Ghalib**, propose a total lump-sum of **\\$27,772.50** (inclusive of contingency) for the 11-month assignment as Entrepreneurship Consultant. This figure reflects my daily rate of **\\$350** multiplied by an estimated **76 days** across the project’s deliverables. Travel costs (if required) and daily subsistence allowance would be reimbursed by UNICEF or otherwise negotiated. I can commence work on **January 10, 2025**, and have current health insurance coverage._\n\n---\n\n## **Additional Tips**\n\n- **Keep It Simple**: UNICEF often prefers a clean, easy-to-read financial breakdown.  \n- **Add a Brief Narrative**: A short paragraph explaining your approach to each cost item can help justify the total.  \n- **Review the TOR**: Double-check if UNICEF wants the cost breakdown per deliverable or purely a single lump-sum. Each office can have slightly different rules.  \n- **Ensure Accuracy**: If your daily rate or the number of days per deliverable changes, update all calculations accordingly before you finalize the submission.\n\nThis layout should sufficiently cover the costs per deliverable, total lump-sum, and any additional required expenses, while indicating your availability and confirming health insurance coverage.",

Dividing **90 days** across 11 months averages to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Monthly Average Workload} = \\frac{90 \\text{ days}}{11 \\text{ months}} = \\text{~8.2 days/month}\n     \\]\n   - This suggests a workload of roughly **2 days/week**, leaving ample space to pursue other opportunities.\n\n### **What This Means for You**:\n- You could comfortably take on another **20–30% role**, depending on its flexibility and intensity.\n- Alternatively, you could dedicate remaining time to personal projects, skill-building, or freelance work.\n\n### **Full-Year Feasibility**:\nYes, spreading the work across the full year is feasible and allows for better flexibility to align with outreach timelines, stakeholder availability, and reporting needs. Buffering extra time for unpredictable delays (e.g., slow responses, additional revisions) further supports this approach.\n\nWould you like help drafting a pitch or plan for a secondary role or optimizing how to schedule your workload for the year?",

      "content": "### **Proposed Timeline for the 90-Day Workload**\n\nWhile the total work is estimated at 90 days, spreading it across the full year allows flexibility for:\n1. **Outreach and Coordination**: Some phases (e.g., stakeholder interviews, follow-on funding, partnership-building) are time-dependent and rely on external parties. These activities typically require waiting periods that stretch timelines.\n2. **Revisions and Feedback**: Deliverables such as strategic documents, frameworks, and proposals often involve multiple review cycles.\n3. **Contextual Factors**: Emergencies, slow response times from stakeholders, or resource alignment issues could require extra time.\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Duration**\nGiven the above considerations, proposing the full year (January–December 2025) is **reasonable and realistic**, as it matches the TOR's timeline. This approach reflects:\n- **Alignment with UNICEF Expectations**: They likely expect a consultant to work steadily over the year, accommodating the TOR's staggered deliverables with intervals for outreach, learning events, and feedback collection.\n- **Commitment to Quality**: A full-year proposal demonstrates that you’re prioritizing quality and coordination rather than rushing deliverables.\n\n---\n\n### **Shorter Alternatives**\nIf you'd prefer to propose a shorter duration to emphasize efficiency:\n1. **6–9 Months**: This could work if:\n   - Outreach/coordination dependencies are front-loaded or well-organized.\n   - Some activities (like webinars or case studies) can overlap or run in parallel.\n2. **Key Risk**: Condensing the timeline increases pressure to meet outreach and review deadlines. Any delays could lead to missed milestones.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation for Application Form**\n- **Propose Full Year (January–December 2025)**: This aligns with the TOR’s staggered deliverables and ensures adequate time for outreach, feedback, and high-quality outputs.\n- **Rationale**: Emphasize that this timeline ensures flexibility for stakeholder coordination and unforeseen challenges, ensuring all deliverables meet UNICEF’s standards.\n\nIf you’re leaning toward a shorter duration, let me know, and we can draft a clear justification for it.",

With your background in ecosystem mapping and data visualization, this work is achievable in 1–2 weeks.\n   - **Current Allocation**: 10 days → Could be shortened to 7–8 days.\n   \n2. **Developing Strategic Documents (Phases 2, 3, 4):**  \n   - These include the operational plan, portfolio strategy, and management framework. Since these rely heavily on existing tools and templates you’ve developed in the past (e.g., Bloom frameworks, M&E templates), you can draft these quickly and fine-tune them during reviews.  \n   - **Current Allocation**: 23 days → Could be shortened to 16–18 days combined.\n\n3. **Knowledge Products (Phase 7):**  \n   - Creating case studies and reports can be streamlined by leveraging existing success stories and adapting content from other projects.  \n   - **Current Allocation**: 6 days → Could be done in 4–5 days.\n\n---\n\n#### **Where to Leave Spaciousness (Dependent on Others)**\n1. **Stakeholder Outreach & Interviews (Phase 1, 5B):**  \n   - Reaching out to stakeholders for interviews, partnerships, and funding discussions is time-consuming. Scheduling, aligning, and getting responses from diverse stakeholders can cause delays.  \n   - **Recommendation**: Allow sufficient buffer time (e.g., 2–4 weeks of outreach).\n\n2. **Workshops and Webinars (Phases 9, 10):**  \n   - Planning, delivering, and documenting workshops/webinars require collaboration with UNICEF teams and external partners. These sessions also need to fit into their schedules.  \n   - **Recommendation**: Maintain the allocated timeline (~1 month each) to avoid rushing.\n\n3. **Follow-On Funding (Phase 5B):**  \n   - Building partnerships and follow-on funding mechanisms takes negotiation and back-and-forth discussions. These are often out of your control and need buffer time.  \n   - **Recommendation**: Stick to the TOR timeline for this phase.\n\n4. **Feedback Cycles:**  \n   - Deliverables like the entrepreneurship strategy and portfolio framework involve multiple review rounds with UNICEF and partners.  \n   - **Recommendation**: Allocate 2–3 days per deliverable for revisions.\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Faster Timeline**\nIf you aim to compress the work, here’s a faster (but realistic) version of the timeline:\n\n| **Deliverable**                            | **Current TOR Deadline** | **Proposed Deadline**    | **Reason for Compression**                          |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Mapping Report                             | Feb 15, 2025             | Feb 7, 2025              | Independent work; less reliance on external inputs.|\n| Operational Plan for Support System        | Mar 5, 2025              | Feb 28, 2025             | Can build off existing frameworks/templates.       |\n| Entrepreneurship Portfolio Strategy        | Mar 31, 2025             | Mar 15, 2025             | Shortens review time; maintains quality.           |\n| Portfolio Management Framework Report      | Apr 22, 2025             | Apr 10, 2025             | Uses similar tools as the support system plan.     |\n| Toolkit for Incubation Systems             | May 14, 2025             | Apr 30, 2025             | Independent work that can overlap with Phase 4.    |\n| Follow-On Funding Strategy Report          | Jun 12, 2025             | May 30, 2025             | Outreach buffer still included.                    |\n| Egypt CO Model Technical Report            | Jul 10, 2025             | Jun 15, 2025             | Fieldwork/documentation overlaps with prior phases.|\n| Knowledge Products                         | Aug 28, 2025             | Jul 30, 2025             | Accelerate drafting of case studies.               |\n| Funding Proposals                          | Sep 19, 2025             | Aug 15, 2025             | Can be drafted alongside earlier funding strategy. |\n| Capacity-Building Sessions                 | Oct 24, 2025             | Sep 30, 2025             | Workshops follow proposal phase.                   |\n| Webinars / Learning Events                 | Nov 18, 2025             | Oct 20, 2025             | Topics align with earlier deliverables.            |\n| Results Framework                          | Dec 31, 2025             | Nov 30, 2025             | Final reporting can begin earlier.                 |\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points for the Application**\n- **Timeline Flexibility**: Propose the full year in your application but indicate your ability to compress certain phases if needed, depending on UNICEF’s priorities.\n- **Highlight Spacious Phases**: Emphasize areas requiring stakeholder collaboration and feedback cycles, justifying the need for flexibility.\n- **Commitment to Quality**: Make it clear that while some phases can be expedited, maintaining quality and alignment with UNICEF’s standards is your top priority.\n\nIf this compressed timeline works for you, we can finalize it into your financial proposal and highlight it in the application form.",

      "content": "To ensure the workload realistically aligns with the 90-day timeline while accounting for buffers, it’s essential to evaluate each deliverable, its dependencies, and potential challenges. Below are questions and considerations to help identify where expectations might be unreasonable and where adjustments are necessary:\n\n---\n\n### **Questions to Clarify Scope and Realistic Buffers**\n\n#### **1. Stakeholder Coordination and External Dependencies**\n- **Mapping Report (Phase 1):**  \n   - How many stakeholders or initiatives need to be mapped? Are their contact details and availability already known?\n   - Will data be readily available, or is significant primary research required?\n   - **Buffer Suggestion**: Add 2–3 extra days for slow responses or incomplete data.\n\n- **Follow-On Funding Strategy Report (Phase 5B):**  \n   - How many potential partners need to be contacted, and do you have a shortlist of relevant contacts?\n   - What is the typical response time for partnerships in similar projects?\n   - **Buffer Suggestion**: Add 3–5 days for outreach delays or follow-ups.\n\n- **Capacity-Building Sessions (Phase 9):**  \n   - Will these workshops require extensive customization, or can existing materials be repurposed?  \n   - Are UNICEF’s internal teams and implementing partners known and readily available for scheduling?  \n   - **Buffer Suggestion**: Add 2–3 days for revisions and logistics.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Writing, Reviewing, and Iterating Deliverables**\n- **Portfolio Strategy Document (Phase 3):**\n   - Will multiple rounds of feedback from UNICEF and external stakeholders be required?\n   - Are there any pre-approved templates/frameworks to follow?\n   - **Buffer Suggestion**: Add 3 days for feedback iterations.\n\n- **Knowledge Products (Phase 7):**\n   - Do you already have access to relevant case studies and data, or will you need to gather new information?\n   - How much review and approval time is typically required for publishing knowledge products?  \n   - **Buffer Suggestion**: Add 2–3 days for editing and approval cycles.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Scheduling and Delivery Logistics**\n- **Workshops and Webinars (Phases 9 & 10):**  \n   - How flexible are participants’ schedules? Will time zones or holidays pose challenges?  \n   - Will these sessions require live facilitation, or can some be pre-recorded/self-guided?  \n   - **Buffer Suggestion**: Add 5 days total across these phases for scheduling/logistics.\n\n- **Final Handover and Results Framework (Phase 11):**\n   - How extensive is the results framework expected to be? Will additional pilots or testing be required?  \n   - Will you need to provide live training on the framework or just documentation?  \n   - **Buffer Suggestion**: Add 3 days for polishing the framework and addressing final feedback.\n\n---\n\n### **Deliverable Adjustments**\nHere’s how you could **extend the timeline closer to 90 days** by incorporating reasonable buffers:\n\n| **Deliverable**                         | **Original Days** | **Adjusted Days** | **Reason for Adjustment**                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Mapping Report**                      | 8                 | 10                | Adds buffer for stakeholder interviews and slow responses.     |\n| **Operational Plan**                    | 6                 | 8                 | Extra time for refining tools and feedback collection.          |\n| **Portfolio Strategy Document**         | 10                | 13                | Adds 3 days for stakeholder feedback and iteration cycles.      |\n| **Portfolio Management Framework**      | 8                 | 10                | Includes time for testing and technical M&E revisions.          |\n| **Incubation Toolkit**                  | 7                 | 9                 | Adds time for cross-referencing best practices and pilot tests. |\n| **Follow-On Funding Strategy**          | 6                 | 9                 | Includes buffer for outreach delays and follow-ups.             |\n| **Egypt CO Model Refinement**           | 8                 | 10                | Adds time for coordination with local stakeholders.             |\n| **Knowledge Products**                  | 6                 | 8                 | Incorporates additional time for editing and approvals.         |\n| **Funding Proposals**                   | 5                 | 7                 | Adds buffer for proposal refinement and alignment checks.       |\n| **Capacity-Building Sessions**          | 8                 | 11                | Allows for extra customization and scheduling challenges.       |\n| **Webinars/Learning Events**            | 4                 | 7                 | Adds buffer for planning and participant coordination.          |\n| **Results Framework & Handover**        | 6                 | 8                 | Adds extra time for testing and final approval.                 |\n\n---\n\n### **New Total**\n- **Original Total Days**: 90  \n- **Adjusted Total Days with Buffers**: **110 days**\n\n---\n\n### **Should You Propose the Full Year or Shorter?**\nIf the TOR allows flexibility in the timeline, **propose 110 days** of work stretched across the full year. This provides spaciousness for:\n1. **Unforeseen Delays**: Like scheduling conflicts or iterative feedback.\n2. **High-Quality Outputs**: You’ll have time to refine, test, and adapt deliverables without rushing.\n\nIf UNICEF prefers efficiency, propose completing the work in **9–10 months** with clear notes on buffer areas for stakeholder collaboration and reviews.\n\nWould you like to refine this proposal further or focus on a specific section?",

      "content": "Dear UNICEF Hiring Committee,\nI am writing to apply for the Entrepreneurship Consultant position with Generation Unlimited (GenU), bringing over 15 years of experience designing and implementing youth-focused entrepreneurship programs across the MENA region. My background combines building entrepreneurial ecosystems, developing innovative learning methodologies, and creating scalable support systems - with a particular focus on youth resilience and sustainable development.\nCurrently, I'm completing a project with the International Trade Center in Iraq focused on green sustainable housing, where I facilitate workshops in Arabic and support young entrepreneurs in developing environmentally conscious solutions. Previously, I founded Bloom.pm, where we've supported over 950 entrepreneurs across 16 countries using a unique assessment-driven methodology that enables customized learning journeys. Our approach has consistently achieved a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating while demonstrating measurable improvements in entrepreneur resilience and success rates.\nMy experience is particularly relevant to GenU's objectives in several key areas:\nPortfolio Management & Support Systems: I've developed the Bloom platform that integrates assessment tools, progress tracking, and targeted interventions - enabling program managers to support more entrepreneurs effectively while maintaining personalized attention. This system has been successfully adopted by multiple accelerators through our training-of-trainers programs.\nRegional Expertise: Having worked extensively throughout MENA, including Egypt during the Arab Spring and recently in Iraq, I understand the unique challenges and opportunities for youth entrepreneurship in the region. I conduct workshops in Arabic and have deep connections with entrepreneurship support organizations across the ecosystem, including partnerships through the Safir program network.\nResearch-Backed Methodology: My master's research at Learning Planet Institute focused on post-traumatic growth in entrepreneurship contexts, leading to evidence-based approaches for building resilience in youth entrepreneurs. This research has informed program designs that demonstrably improve outcomes, particularly in challenging environments.\nGreen Skills Integration: Most recently, I've led programs specifically focused on sustainable entrepreneurship, including the HerMeNow accelerator supporting green solutions across MENA and Africa, and ITC's sustainable housing initiative in Iraq. This experience directly aligns with GenU's focus on green thematic pathways.\nI am particularly excited about contributing to GenU's mission of youth empowerment through entrepreneurship. My daily rate is $400, with a total project cost of $100,000 (inclusive of travel and expenses). I am available to begin on January 10th, 2025, and am prepared to meet all deliverables as outlined in the Terms of Reference.\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience designing resilient entrepreneurship ecosystems can contribute to GenU's vision of nurturing the next generation of innovators.\nSincerely,\nBilal Ghalib\nbilal@bloom.pm | +1 (478) 227-2253Link: https://thedo-school-careers.jobs.personio.de/job/1849984#apply\nRole: Director of Sustainable Ventures\n\nName *: Bilal Ghalib\nEmail *: bilal@bloom.pm / bg@bilalghalib.com \nPhone *: +1 (478) 227-2253\nAvailable from *: Now\nExpected salary: £100.000/ year\nLocation *: Lille, France\nWhy are you interested in working with The DO? *: \nThe DO School's mission to unlock youth potential for positive change mirrors my life's work. Having spent 15 years building ecosystems of innovation and social entrepreneurship, particularly at Bloom where we've supported 933 enterprises across 16 countries, I've seen firsthand the transformative power of giving young people the tools and community to address global challenges.\n\nWhile Bloom has achieved a significant impact, the ongoing regional conflicts have created operational challenges for organizations across Lebanon. This transition creates an opportunity to bring the methodologies, networks, and lessons learned from Bloom to a larger platform and new geographies.\n\nAs a new father to my one-year-old Suleiman, I'm increasingly aware of the challenges young people are inheriting and their incredible capacity for positive action. A 2021 survey of 10,000 16-25-year-olds across ten countries showed that 75% find \"the future frightening.\" Yet research shows that climate anxiety symptoms improve when young people actively engage in solutions – exactly why programs like the DO School Fellowship are essential. Providing resources, community, and context supports young people in becoming more joyful, proactive co-constructors of their future.\n\nThis role is an opportunity to take forward my work at Bloom and amplify the impact the DO School fellowship program can have. One day, my son Suleiman might even be a DO Fellow. Fundamentally, I want to help create the support systems his generation will need to thrive.\n\n\nI’m not entirely sure what the long-term expectations are for this role—it might be permanent, or it could be more of a short-term arrangement. Honestly, I’ve even thought about it as a kind of consultancy, a way to share the experience and insights I’ve gained through designing pedagogies at Bloom. At the same time, I’d be learning new approaches from you all, expanding my skill set, and seeing how a different organization tackles similar challenges.\n\nUltimately, I think this is about mutual learning and growth: I bring the expertise I’ve developed, and in return, I get to explore how you do things at the DO School. It feels like the right fit for me at this stage in my career.\n\nHow does your personal, professional and/or educational experience qualify you for this position? * : I think my time at Bloom is a great example. I wasn’t just designing programs and projects—I was also right there in the thick of it, running them day-to-day as the lead trainer. That hands-on involvement taught me so much about how to take an idea from a concept all the way through to something that really works in practice. It’s that blend of strategic planning and on-the-ground execution that I believe makes me well-suited for this role.\n\nAs a recent college graduate during the economic downturn of 2008, I have dedicated my career to building ecosystems of mutual support for positive innovation. During this period, I saw the opportunity to transform vacated factories, the free time of the unemployed, and the momentum of the open-source movement into a grassroots shift—creating the jobs and future we wanted by sharing resources, tools, ideas, and space. This foundational experience shaped my belief in the power of grassroots organizing and community-driven innovation to build resilient systems and transform lives.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring, as young people in the Middle East demanded systemic change, I saw the potential for not just top-down reform, but a flipping of power—empowering communities to build their future through grassroots organizing, innovation, and entrepreneurship. This inspired me to launch The Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), promoting and supporting innovation communities and spaces from Egypt to Nigeria and Iraq. In 2016, I founded Bloom to provide deeper support for leveraging these innovation capacities, channeling them toward solving social and ecological challenges.\n\nMy work at Bloom was directed toward designing personal and professional growth pedagogies that empower social entrepreneurs to achieve both well-being and impact. I designed our learning by doing together learning process and set of learning principles. My next steps were to transform this approach into a ToT that we successfully packaged and supported other social impact accelerators in learning to help them offer custom learning journeys to their participants. \n\nMy Master’s research on post-traumatic growth emerged from my experiences working in Lebanon during the pandemic and the Beirut Port Explosion. I sought to understand what factors helped social entrepreneurs persevere and maintain balance during crises and how they continued to deliver social and ecological impact. These insights shaped Bloom’s Accelerator pedagogy and emphasized the critical role of self-knowledge and personal growth in creating sustainable change.\n\nProfessionally, I’ve built networks with foundations, corporations, and NGOs, moved from building tech prototypes to managing teams and expanded my work exploring well-being-centered program designs. I have deepened my commitment to personal growth practices, recognizing that the greatest impact starts with oneself and expands outward—to those around us and through our work.\n\nThese experiences and skills—rooted in community empowerment, innovative program design, and a holistic approach to sustainability—align closely with The DO’s mission. The opportunity to leverage this expertise in collaboration with The DO’s team would allow me to amplify the impact of my work and contribute meaningfully to supporting young innovators as they create the future they want to see.\n\nWhat languages do you feel comfortable working in? *: English and Arabic\nHow did you find out about this job? *: Nihal actually mentioned this position to me, and then I saw it listed on LinkedIn.\nLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/bilalghalib \nDocuments: CV\n\nBilal Ghalib\nLille, France 59800\nbilal@bloom.pm | +1 (478) 227-2253\nDec 12th, 2024\nDear Do Schooler \nWhat excites me most about joining The DO is the potential to work with a team to support young people around the world in becoming proactive co-creators of their futures. I’m excited to see how the knowledge, networks, and methodologies at Bloom translate and to bring wellbeing and welldoing together at DO. \nPrograms like beVisioneers are critical when young people feel increasingly anxious about the future and can help them take the fear and transform it into planet-positive action. Working in Iraq and Lebanon, I know how often people think their only solution is to leave. Yet, I’ve seen how these programs can offer participants practical tools while fostering agency, belonging, and hope.\nAt Bloom, we’ve worked with 933 enterprises across 16 countries, running over 100 accelerator and sprint cycles and engaging hundreds of mentors to build communities of innovation and support. Our goal to have our selection, monitoring, and disbursements match entrepreneur’s learning goals has led us to develop unique pedagogies and 96% of people going through our programs would recommend them for others. \nWorking in conflict zones, I’ve developed pedagogies that integrate well-being with impact, informed by my Master’s research on post-traumatic growth, where I explored how social entrepreneurs sustain their efforts during crises. My problem-solving mind and love of people led me to facilitate workshops in Arabic in Mosul, run design-thinking programs with marginalized youth in Lebanon, and manage cross-cultural teams. Looking back I see I’ve always sought to build environments where people can thrive and grow.\nWorking with the DO School is a beautiful next step where I can bring my experience in program design, grassroots organizing, and collaborative leadership to a team equally dedicated to creating lasting impact. I’m eager to leverage the lessons, networks, and systems I’ve developed to help The DO expand its reach and create fellowships and programs that accompany youth in building a flourishing future—for themselves and the world.\nThank you for considering my application. I’d love to get on a call and discuss how my background and skills align with The DO’s mission and this role.\nWarm regards,\nBilal Ghalib\nsome of my writing: Cultivating Resilience through Good Questions and Social Support\nPractical Interventions for Entrepreneurs Navigating Challenges\nIn our previous research publication, we explored factors that support people during times of difficulty and instability. This work was inspired by our experiences with social entrepreneurs affected by the Beirut blast, where we observed both the painful impact and the unexpected resilience within our program communities.\n\n\n\nExamining the literature and our data, we found deliberate rumination, social support, and narrative reappraisal are key factors in promoting post-traumatic growth (PTG). Interestingly, our pre/post assessments of teams Values in Action Character Profile showed that humor had the strongest connection with PTG. We believe humor's ability to diffuse stress, unblock the freeze response, open possibility spaces, and foster cognitive flexibility aligns with the skills needed for creative problem-solving in challenging situations.\n\n\n\nWhile check-in questions can vary to serve your organization's goals, we encourage incorporating questions that spark deliberate rumination and community building. These factors promote creativity, growth, and resilience by encouraging realistic, growth-oriented reappraisal of situations and narrative formation.\n\n\n\nWe believe that entrepreneurship programs, especially for social impact entrepreneurs working in difficult areas, can provide a valuable home for these discussions. It's essential to establish a space that builds meaningful relationships and provides framing for navigating transitions.\n\n\n\nUse these questions in your programs, classrooms, or even with your family at breakfast. They should be fun, help develop deeper relationships, and spark creativity. They touch on many of the factors which promote Post Traumatic Growth, including reappraising past difficulties, creating empowered narratives, identifing ways forward, celebrating achievements, and recognizing new opportunities. We did our best to blend reflection on past experiences with humor in daily reflections, take these as a starting point and mix in the features above to give them your own unique twist.\n\nUnexpected Positives and Empowered Narratives\n1. What's a surprise from your past that makes you smile?\n\n2. What past challenge did you overcome that seemed insurmountable at first?\n\n3. If a past mishap were a plot twist in your superhero origin story, how did it turn you into a champion?\n\nWays Forward and Celebrating Achievements\n4. What small step did you take in the past that felt like a giant leap for mankind (or at least for you)? \n\n5. What's your 'I nailed it!' moment from the past week? Even if it's just resisting the urge to snooze the alarm?\n\nNew Opportunities and Silver Linings\n6. What's a new door that opened for you given the situation, even if it was just a crack and you had to squeeze through? \n\n7. How can you turn a past challenge into a silver lining?\n\nPerspective Shifts and Shared Laughter\n8. What's the funniest thing about a recent or historic challenge you faced? \n\n9. What past moment made you laugh so hard you forgot you were supposed to be stressed?\n\n10. What's something you took seriously in the past but laugh about now?\n\nTransforming Past Challenges and Finding Light Moments\n11. How can you turn a past failure into a funny story that makes you laugh now? \n\n12. What hard-won lesson from the past can you apply to today's challenges with a touch of humor?\n\nThese questions are designed to touch upon factors that promote post-traumatic growth, including sharing emotions, cognitive processing, positive reappraisal, and committing to growth actions. By incorporating them into your daily or weekly routines, you can foster an environment that supports resilience, creativity, and positive growth, in the face of significant challenges or just any old regular Monday.Thriving in 2020, Post Traumatic Growth For Social Entrepreneurs\nUncategorized\nInsights from the First Edition of the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation Program\nAs Bloom’s program manager during the the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation (ACSI) program, we faced unprecedented challenges including a global pandemic, economic crisis, political instability, and the devastating Beirut Port explosion. I thought I’d share this report on why we believe the program participants persevered and how it also fostered resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG). Our findings suggest that structured social support and deliberate reflection can significantly enhance resilience in social entrepreneurs, even amid extreme adversity.\n\nIntroduction\n2020 was a year of extraordinary challenges globally, with Lebanon facing particularly severe hardships. As we ran the ACSI program with teams across Lebanon, we encountered a perfect storm of crises:\n\nGlobal COVID-19 pandemic\nSevere economic downturn\nPolitical instability\nResource shortages\nRising unemployment\nThe catastrophic Beirut Port explosion\nThese events profoundly impacted our participants, with some team members directly affected by the port explosion. Despite these challenges, the ACSI program continued, adapting to provide crucial support during this tumultuous period.\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship support organizations, like Bloom, are working in an environment and an age of seemingly accelerating incidences of social, political, and environmental challenges. Thus, identifying the factors that promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) is critical. \n\nProgram Approach\nThe ACSI program employed several key strategies:\n\nPrinciples-based training: We focused on core principles of social innovation rather than rigid methodologies, allowing for flexibility in application.\nQuantitative/Qualitative data and reflection: Using the Values In Action Character Profile(VIA) – a psychometrically validated tool – helped us assess and support participants’ character strengths.\nRegular convening circles: We maintained consistent check-ins, even in the immediate aftermath of the port explosion, fostering a supportive community.\nResearch Findings\nOur research compared ACSI participants with a control group of individuals who were assessed but unable to participate in the program. Key findings include:\n\nEnhanced resilience: ACSI participants demonstrated greater resilience in the face of acute challenges.\nPositive impact of social support: Regular check-ins and a supportive community correlated with improved coping mechanisms.\nImportance of deliberate rumination: Structured reflection on experiences contributed to personal growth.\nCharacter strength development: Participants showed increases in traits associated with PTG, such as Hope, Persistence, and Gratitude.\nThe Values In Action (VIA) assessment offers a unique perspective in psychological measurement. While traditionally Psychological measures measure what goes wrong, the VIA identifies what is working well in a flourishing life. We used this psychometrically validated instrument to assess teams before the ACSI accelerator program and after the program’s completion.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed a control group of teams who were unable to participate in the program. Our findings revealed a difference: teams who participated in the ACSI program demonstrated greater resilience when facing acute challenges. This observation led us to a crucial question: What specific aspects of the ACSI program contributed to this enhanced resilience?\n\nDiving into the literature, we found connections between social support, asking meaningful questions, and PTG. \n\nImplications for Social Entrepreneurship Support\n\nWhile traumatic events can destabilize the status quo by disrupting our worldview, how we reconstruct those narratives is critically important. The ACSI program’s structure appears to have provided a framework for positive narrative reconstruction, even in the face of severe challenges. \n\nThe originators of the concept of PTG, Tedeschi, and Calhoun, identify Deliberate Rumination and Positive Social Support as important factors in promoting the possibility of growth after a difficulty. We believe one of the reasons teams in the ACSI program fared better is that we developed a “pre-resilience” habit of holding a space where important questions are raised in a socially supportive setting, our check-in circles.\n\nLimitations and Future Research\nIt’s important to note that while many people experience PTG after difficulty, it’s not universal or expected from everyone. Factors such as prior life experiences, personal schemas, and individual differences play significant roles.\n\nOur study’s limitations include:\n\nSmall sample size\nFocus on a specific geographic and cultural context\nRelatively short timeframe for observing long-term effects\nFuture research could explore:\n\nLarger-scale studies across diverse contexts\nLongitudinal studies to assess long-term impacts\nComparative studies of different support methodologies\nWe welcome collaboration opportunities with other organizations to expand this research.\n\nRecommendations for Organizations\nBased on our findings, we recommend the following actions for social impact accelerators, educational institutions, and businesses:\n\nImplement Regular Check-ins:\nEstablish consistent times for team or community gatherings.\nExample: Establish regular check-in sessions where participants share challenges and successes.\nFoster Deliberate Reflection:\nIncorporate structured reflection activities into programs.\nDevelop Personal and Professional Strengths\nUse assessments and activities to help people identify personal and professional strengths. \nExample: Consider using the VIA assessment to identify and nurture key traits and measure flourishing.\nCreate Supportive Communities:\nFacilitate peer support networks within and beyond formal program structures.\nConclusion and Call to Action\nThe ACSI program’s experience during 2020 demonstrates the potential for entrepreneurship training programs to go beyond business skills, fostering resilience and personal growth. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, organizations can create more supportive, resilient, and growth-oriented environments for social entrepreneurs.\n\nWe invite other organizations to join us in this important work. By fostering resilience and PTG, we can build a community of social entrepreneurs better equipped to drive positive change, taking care of themselves, others, and their mission – even in the face of significant adversity.\n\nFor more detailed information and data, please download our full research report: “Character Strengths and Fostering PTG” Character Strengths And Fostering PTG (draft to

UNICEF Hiring Committee,\nDear UNICEF Hiring Committee,\nI am writing to apply for the Entrepreneurship Consultant position with Generation Unlimited (GenU), bringing over 15 years of experience designing and implementing youth-focused entrepreneurship programs across the MENA region. My background combines building entrepreneurial ecosystems, developing innovative learning methodologies, and creating scalable support systems - with a particular focus on youth resilience and sustainable development.\nCurrently, I'm completing a project with the International Trade Center in Iraq focused on green sustainable housing, where I facilitate workshops in Arabic and support young entrepreneurs in developing environmentally conscious solutions. Previously, I founded Bloom.pm, where we've supported over 950 entrepreneurs across 16 countries using a unique assessment-driven methodology that enables customized learning journeys. Our approach has consistently achieved a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating while demonstrating measurable improvements in entrepreneur resilience and success rates.\nMy experience is particularly relevant to GenU's objectives in several key areas:\nPortfolio Management & Support Systems: I've developed the Bloom platform that integrates assessment tools, progress tracking, and targeted interventions - enabling program managers to support more entrepreneurs effectively while maintaining personalized attention. This system has been successfully adopted by multiple accelerators through our training-of-trainers programs.\nRegional Expertise: Having worked extensively throughout MENA, including Egypt during the Arab Spring and recently in Iraq, I understand the unique challenges and opportunities for youth entrepreneurship in the region. I conduct workshops in Arabic and have deep connections with entrepreneurship support organizations across the ecosystem, including partnerships through the Safir program network.\nResearch-Backed Methodology: My master's research at Learning Planet Institute focused on post-traumatic growth in entrepreneurship contexts, leading to evidence-based approaches for building resilience in youth entrepreneurs. This research has informed program designs that demonstrably improve outcomes, particularly in challenging environments.\nGreen Skills Integration: Most recently, I've led programs specifically focused on sustainable entrepreneurship, including the HerMeNow accelerator supporting green solutions across MENA and Africa, and ITC's sustainable housing initiative in Iraq. This experience directly aligns with GenU's focus on green thematic pathways.\nI am particularly excited about contributing to GenU's mission of youth empowerment through entrepreneurship. My daily rate is $400, with a total project cost of $100,000 (inclusive of travel and expenses). I am available to begin on January 10th, 2025, and am prepared to meet all deliverables as outlined in the Terms of Reference.\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience designing resilient entrepreneurship ecosystems can contribute to GenU's vision of nurturing the next generation of innovators.\nSincerely, Bilal Ghalib bilal@bloom.pm | +1 (478) 227-2253\n\n\n\nI am writing to apply for the Entrepreneurship Consultant position, bringing over 15 years of experience in entrepreneurship development, curriculum design, and innovation across multiple regions, including the Middle East and Europe. My background spans founding a social enterprise support organization (Bloom.pm) in Lebanon, serving as a Sustainability Curriculum Consultant for the International Trade Center (ITC) in Iraq, and conducting research into post-traumatic growth and resilience following the Beirut blast.\nThroughout my career, I have focused on helping entrepreneurs discover and express their fullest potential. My approach emphasizes learner-driven methodologies, blending personal growth with actionable business tasks. For instance, I have developed quiz-based assessments that enable participants to self-identify growth areas, receive targeted mentorship, and tap into shared resources. This allows a single trainer or a small team to scale support effectively to large cohorts, a framework that aligns closely with UNICEF’s mission to maximize impact for youth worldwide.\nMoreover, I have a demonstrated record of collaborating with UN agencies, and successfully aligning deliverables through structured reporting, bilateral meetings, and robust communication channels. My extensive work in diverse cultural settings—from Lebanon to Iraq—has honed my ability to adapt rapidly, navigate institutional requirements, and cultivate strong stakeholder relationships.\nKey highlights of my experience include:\nDesigning and managing accelerator programs that served 950+ entrepreneurs, achieving a 4.8 NPS rating.\nImplementing research-driven evaluations, including a study showing enhanced resilience and lower stress levels among participants post-Beirut blast.\nOverseeing the creation of integrated software platforms (Bloom.pm) that support real-time monitoring, track user milestones, and maintain cohesive online communities.\nBuilding funding and partnership networks by connecting various ecosystem players, from private investors to international NGOs.\nShould I be selected, I will bring a results-driven mindset, a passion for youth empowerment, and proven strategic planning skills to the Entrepreneurship Consultant role. My daily rate is currently set at $400, with a total cost for the full assignment at $100,000 (inclusive of travel and other expenses). I am available to begin on January 10th, 2025, and I am prepared to meet all required deliverables punctually and in full alignment with UNICEF’s standards.\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing my expertise to UNICEF’s essential work in nurturing the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators.\n\n\n\nFinancial Proposal\nConsultant Name: Bilal Ghalib\nPosition: Entrepreneurship Consultant\nAssignment Period: January 10, 2025 – December 31, 2025\nDaily Rate: USD 350\nTotal Estimated Days: 90 days\nTotal Lump Sum: USD 31,500\n\nIntroduction\nThis financial proposal outlines the estimated costs for the consultancy assignment as per the Terms of Reference (TOR) provided by UNICEF.

      "content": "i want a table it's a bit ugly - any questions? does it align with my cover letter?\nDear UNICEF Hiring Committee,\nI am writing to apply for the Entrepreneurship Consultant position with Generation Unlimited (GenU). I bring over 15 years of experience designing and implementing youth-focused entrepreneurship programs across the MENA region. My background combines building entrepreneurial ecosystems, developing innovative learning methodologies, and creating scalable support systems, with a focus on youth resilience and sustainable development.\nI recently completed a project with the International Trade Center in Iraq focused on entrepreneurship in green and sustainable housing in a post-conflict setting. I conducted literature reviews, interviews, and framework analysis and developed a heritage innovation curriculum for environmentally conscious housing solutions. Previously, I founded Bloom.pm, where we've supported over 950 entrepreneurs across 16 countries using an assessment-driven methodology that enables customized learning journeys. Our approach has consistently achieved a 4.8/5 satisfaction rating while demonstrating measurable improvements in the resilience and success rates of entrepreneurs.\nMy experience is particularly relevant to GenU's objectives in several key areas:\nPortfolio Management & Support Systems: I've developed the Bloom platform, which integrates assessment tools, progress tracking, and targeted interventions. This enables program managers to support larger programs while maintaining personalized attention. Multiple accelerators have successfully adopted this system through our training-of-trainers programs.\nRegional Expertise: Having worked extensively throughout MENA, including Egypt and recently in Iraq, I understand the unique challenges and opportunities for youth entrepreneurship in the region. I conduct workshops in Arabic and have deep connections with entrepreneurship support organizations across the ecosystem I’ve been supporting since 2011.\nResearch-Backed Methodology: My master's research at Learning Planet Institute focused on post-traumatic growth in entrepreneurship contexts, leading to evidence-based approaches for building resilience in youth entrepreneurs. This research has informed program designs that improve outcomes, particularly in challenging environments.\nGreen Skills Integration: At Bloom, we’ve run many programs focused on sustainable entrepreneurship, including the HerMeNow accelerator supporting green solutions across MENA and Africa. Working with the UN ITC's sustainable housing initiative in Iraq gave me a deeper insight into connecting entrepreneurship and sustainability. This experience directly aligns with GenU's focus on green thematic pathways.\nI am particularly excited about contributing to GenU's mission of youth empowerment through entrepreneurship. My daily rate is $400, with a total project cost of $100,000 (inclusive of travel and expenses). I am available to begin on January 10th, 2025, and am prepared to meet all deliverables outlined in the Terms of Reference.\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience designing resilient entrepreneurship ecosystems can contribute to GenU's vision of nurturing the next generation of innovators.\nSincerely, \nBilal Ghalib bilal@bloom.pm | +1 (478) 227-2253",
