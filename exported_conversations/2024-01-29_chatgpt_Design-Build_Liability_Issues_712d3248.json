      "content": "The article discusses liability issues in design-build contracts in the water infrastructure sector. Design-build projects, which combine design and construction roles, face unique liability challenges. Contractors, now responsible for both construction and design, often seek to limit design-related liabilities, which can lead to a \"liability gap\". Solutions include negotiating acceptable liability limits with project owners and purchasing high-limit, project-specific professional liability policies. Addressing these liabilities requires collaboration among all parties involved, including transparent discussions of goals, requirements, and costs. \n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the original article on the Water Collaborative Delivery Association's website [here](https://watercollaborativedelivery.org/limitation-of-liability-on-design-build-projects/).",

      "content": "Contractors attempt to limit design liabilities in design-build projects for several reasons. Firstly, taking on both design and construction roles increases their risk exposure. Design errors can lead to costly corrections and delays, impacting the project's overall success and the contractor's profitability. Additionally, contractors may not have the same level of design expertise as specialized design firms, making them more vulnerable to design-related issues. Limiting liabilities helps manage these risks, ensuring the contractor's financial protection and project viability.

This includes:\n\n1. **Negotiated Liability Caps**: Parties may agree on a maximum limit of liability, which can be a fixed amount or a percentage of the contract value.\n\n2. **Risk Allocation**: Allocating risks to the party best able to manage them. For example, design risks are often best handled by the contractor, while external risks like regulatory changes may be the owner's responsibility.\n\n3. **Insurance**: Purchasing comprehensive insurance policies can protect against unforeseen liabilities, including errors and omissions in the design.\n\n4. **Detailed Contracts**: Clearly defining responsibilities, obligations, and expectations in the contract can prevent disputes and clarify liability issues.\n\n5. **Quality Assurance and Control**: Implementing robust quality control processes can minimize the risk of design errors.\n\nIt's important for parties to seek legal advice specific to their situation and jurisdiction to ensure the best approach to liability in design-build contracts.",
