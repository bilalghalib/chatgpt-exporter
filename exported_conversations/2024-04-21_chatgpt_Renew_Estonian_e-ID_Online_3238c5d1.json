      "content": "To renew your expired Estonian e-Residency ID, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Online Application**: Visit the official e-Residency website of Estonia. You will need to fill out an application form for the renewal of your e-Residency digital ID.\n\n2. **Documentation**: Provide any required documents that may include a copy of your current passport, a recent photograph, and possibly other personal details or documents that were required in your original application.\n\n3. **Application Fee**: Pay the applicable renewal fee. The fee can be paid online through various methods such as credit card or bank transfer.\n\n4. **Submission and Review**: Once you have submitted your application and paid the fee, it will be reviewed by the Estonian authorities. This process can take a few weeks.\n\n5. **Receiving Your New ID**: If your application is approved, you will be notified about where and when you can pick up your new digital ID. Typically, you can choose to collect it from a designated pickup location either in Estonia or at one of the Estonian embassies or consulates worldwide.\n\nIt's recommended to start the renewal process well before your current ID expires to avoid any lapse in your ability to use the e-Residency services. Also, make sure to check the specific requirements and steps on the official e-Residency website as they may have updates or specific instructions to follow.",
