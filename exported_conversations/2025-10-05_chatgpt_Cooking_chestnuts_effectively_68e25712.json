You know, you cook them and then peel them. It takes a long time. There's very little there. What's a good way of using them?",

      "content": "Chestnuts are tricky because they dry out fast if cooked the wrong way, and the little ones can feel like a lot of work for little payoff. Two parts to your question: **keeping them moist** and **making small ones worth it**.  \n\n---\n\n### 🔹 How to Cook Chestnuts Without Them Getting Dry\n- **Boiling/Simmering (best for moist chestnuts)**  \n  *Score* (cut an “X” or slit) the flat side first. Simmer in salted water for ~20–25 minutes. The shells slip off more easily while warm, and the flesh stays tender and not powdery.  \n  ➡️ Good if you want to mash them, purée them, or use in soups/stews.\n\n- **Oven-Roasting (classic, but can dry out)**  \n  Put them in a hot oven (200°C / 400°F), but to prevent dryness:  \n  - Soak them in hot water for 10–15 minutes first.  \n  - Roast in a covered dish or wrapped in foil with a splash of water.  \n  - Bake ~20 minutes, then peel while still hot.  \n\n- **Pan-Roasting / Chestnut Pan**  \n  If you have a cast-iron skillet, score them, toss in the pan with a splash of water or wine, cover, and shake now and then. The steam keeps them tender.\n\n---\n\n### 🔹 What to Do With Medium–Small Chestnuts\nBecause peeling them one by one isn’t worth it, here are **low-effort, bulk-use ways**:\n\n1. **Chestnut Soup or Purée**  \n   Boil them whole (scored), then mash and pass through a sieve or food mill. The shells and skins mostly stay behind. You don’t need to hand-peel each one.\n\n2. **Infused Milk/Cream for Desserts**  \n   Simmer small chestnuts (whole, scored) in milk or cream with sugar/vanilla. Then strain. You get chestnut-flavored cream for custards, puddings, or coffee drinks without peeling.\n\n3. **Stews and Braises**  \n   Throw them in with meat stews (lamb, chicken, beef). The shells slip off more easily after long simmering, and the nuts give body to the broth.\n\n4. **Grinding into Flour**  \n   If you can dry them fully (in a low oven or dehydrator), you can blitz them into chestnut flour. That way even tiny nuts become useful in breads, pancakes, or pasta.\n\n5. **Sweetened Chestnut Spread (Shortcut)**  \n   Boil, mash with milk + sugar + a touch of rum or vanilla → rustic chestnut cream. Don’t worry about perfectly smooth or perfectly peeled, just strain through a sieve at the end.\n\n---\n\n👉 For small ones, my go-to is **boil → mash → strain** rather than peel. You can make a pot of chestnut soup or a sweet spread with almost no waste.  \n\nWould you like me to give you a couple of **fast recipes** (one savory, one sweet) specifically designed for small chestnuts?",
