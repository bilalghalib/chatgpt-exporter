Your goal is to generate kindness activities that feel as distinctive as a fingerprint – deeply resonant with who they truly are.\n\n## MEMORY ANALYSIS\nFirst, carefully examine the conversation history for clues about the person's sources of meaning. Look for:\n\n- Stories they tell with emotional intensity or detail\n- What they consistently pay attention to or notice\n- People or characters they admire or reference\n- Activities where they mention losing track of time\n- Values they defend or express strong feelings about\n- Moments they describe as meaningful or energizing\n- Negative emotions that might indicate blocked values\n- Consistent patterns in their interests or questions\n\n## SOURCES OF MEANING IDENTIFICATION\nBased on your analysis, identify 2-3 potential \"sources of meaning\" – specific ways of living that create a sense of aliveness for this person.\n\nFor each source, craft 2-3 \"attention policies\" that capture exactly what they find meaningful. Format each as:\n- \"MOMENTS when...\" (specific experiences they value)\n- \"CONNECTIONS that...\" (relationships or interactions they treasure)\n- \"POSSIBILITIES for...\" (opportunities they find exciting)\n- \"EXPRESSIONS of...\" (ways of manifesting values they care about)\n\nThese should be precise and specific, not generic. Look for the particular way this person experiences meaning.\n\nExamples:\n- Not \"MOMENTS of connection\" but \"MOMENTS when vulnerability is met with genuine understanding\"\n- Not \"EXPRESSIONS of creativity\" but \"EXPRESSIONS of creativity that transform everyday objects into sources of delight\"\n\n## TENSION MAPPING\nIdentify 1-2 tensions the person might be experiencing:\n- Conflicts between what energizes them versus what depletes them\n- Areas where they express frustration, guilt, or ambivalence\n- Competing values or priorities they're trying to balance\n- Situations where meaningful activities feel blocked\n\nDescribe these tensions neutrally as observations about their experience.\n\n## CLARIFYING QUESTIONS (ONLY IF NEEDED)\nIf essential information is missing, ask 1-3 light, playful questions like:\n- \"What tiny, quirky thing do you notice or do that most people ignore?\"\n- \"What small ache would you love soothed right now?\"\n- \"Which harmless routine would you secretly like to flip?\"\n- \"If you could leave tiny traces of joy for others to find, what form would they take?\"\n\n## KINDNESS ACTIVITY CREATION\nCreate 3-5 personalized kindness activities as visual \"cards\":\n\n🌱 [EVOCATIVE TITLE]\nWhat: [Brief, vivid description of the activity]\nWhy this fits you: [Connection to their specific sources of meaning]\nTime & materials: [Simple requirements]\nFirst tiny step: [Ultra-doable starting point]\n✨ Ripples: [How this might affect multiple circles]\n\nScore each activity against these factors, aiming for at least 12 checkmarks:\n\nEssential Factors:\n- Personal Symbolism – Uses a unique quirk, memory, or motif of the person\n- Vulnerable Truth – Addresses or acknowledges a real need or desire\n- Gentle Subversion – Harmlessly disrupts a routine or expectation\n- Multi-Layer Impact – Benefits multiple circles (self, others, community, planet)\n- Playful Ritual – Can be repeated easily and joyfully\n- Low Noise/High Meaning – Adds value without requiring recognition\n- Tangible Trace – Leaves a physical or sensory keepsake\n\nExtended Factors (include at least 5):\n- Surprise Element – Contains an unexpected twist or discovery\n- Feasibility – Realistic time/cost/energy requirements\n- Safety & Consent – Respects boundaries and autonomy\n- Inclusivity – Works across different abilities and contexts\n- Eco-Gentleness – Minimal environmental impact\n- Reciprocity-Free – Doesn't create unwanted obligation\n- Story Potential – Likely to become a meaningful narrative\n- Emotional Depth – Evokes genuine feeling\n- Transformation Seed – Could grow into larger change\n- Timing Resonance – Connects to meaningful moments or cycles\n- Sensory Engagement – Involves multiple senses\n- Identity Affirmation – Reinforces valued aspects of self\n- Congruence – Feels authentic coming from this person\n- Ripple Effect – May inspire others toward kindness\n- Cultural Sensitivity – Respects diverse backgrounds\n\nFor truly exceptional activities, also consider:\n- Embodiment Level – Degree of physical vs. digital presence\n- Temporal Span – Momentary vs. extended over time\n- Privacy Gradient – Anonymous vs. acknowledged\n- Resource Type – Using primarily time, skills, creativity, or attention\n- Outcome Attachment – Freedom from specific response expectations\n- Power Balance – Navigates hierarchies with respect\n- Continuity Potential – Could evolve naturally over time\n- Permission Sensitivity – Honors agency throughout\n\n## TONE & APPROACH\n- Write conversationally, like a thoughtful friend\n- Be warm without being artificially cheerful\n- Avoid jargon about \"sources of meaning\" or \"attention policies\"\n- Speak as if you genuinely understand their experiences\n- Create activities that feel custom-made, not generic\n- Focus on what brings them alive, not what they \"should\" do\n\nEnd by inviting them to choose which activity feels most energizing, and remind them that even tiny acts aligned with their sources of meaning can create beautiful ripples.\"\"\"",

      "content": "🌱 Hi there! I’ve carefully reflected on what you've shared previously, and here’s your personalized kindness profile and suggested activities. ✨\n\n---\n\n## Your Unique Sources of Meaning\n\nBased on your stories and reflections, here are three specific ways you experience deep aliveness:\n\n**1. Quiet Acts of Symbolic Beauty**\n- MOMENTS when everyday actions become poetic rituals infused with personal symbolism.\n- CONNECTIONS that carry subtle meanings or hidden layers of care and understanding.\n- EXPRESSIONS of creativity that gently subvert routines, awakening unexpected joy.\n\n**2. Anonymous Mercy and Subtle Sacrifice**\n- MOMENTS when your kindness remains unseen, resonating with themes of humility and hidden generosity.\n- CONNECTIONS that affirm quiet devotion—particularly with family and close loved ones.\n- POSSIBILITIES for creating invisible ripples of comfort, reassurance, and gentle support.\n\n**3. Transformative Connection**\n- MOMENTS when genuine vulnerability meets mutual acceptance, breaking cycles of isolation.\n- CONNECTIONS that transcend physical distance, nurturing meaningful bonds despite separation.\n- EXPRESSIONS of empathy that soothe loneliness and foster authentic intimacy.\n\n---\n\n## Tensions You've Expressed\n- **Isolation vs. Deep Connection:** You often mention feeling socially isolated despite remote interactions. This suggests a tension between your natural inclination for quiet, unacknowledged acts of kindness and a desire for stronger, sustained relationships.\n- **Routine Chaos vs. Intentional Ritual:** You frequently discuss feeling overwhelmed by chaotic interactions (sending messages without following up), which conflicts with your longing for quiet, intentional rituals that provide grounding and clarity.\n\n---\n\n## 🌱 Personalized Kindness Activity Cards 🌱\n\nHere are five carefully crafted kindness activities aligned uniquely with you:\n\n### 🌌 Silent Stars\n**What:** Secretly name stars after family members, write these down beautifully, and send a thoughtful photo of this quiet tribute.\n**Why this fits you:** Combines anonymous mercy, subtle symbolic beauty, and transformative connection—honoring your mom and family from afar.\n**Time & materials:** Star charts or online map, pen, paper.\n**First tiny step:** Choose and mark a star tonight for your mom.\n✨ **Ripples:** Deep comfort for family; creates invisible bonds.\n\n✅ Personal Symbolism  \n✅ Vulnerable Truth  \n✅ Gentle Subversion  \n✅ Multi-Layer Impact  \n✅ Playful Ritual  \n✅ Low Noise/High Meaning  \n✅ Tangible Trace  \n✅ Surprise Element  \n✅ Reciprocity-Free  \n✅ Story Potential  \n✅ Emotional Depth  \n✅ Identity Affirmation  \n✅ Ripple Effect  \n✅ Privacy Gradient  \n\n**(14/12 checkmarks!)**\n\n---\n\n### 🕯️ Candles of Quiet Love\n**What:** Each night, briefly light a small candle as a quiet prayer for someone you're missing deeply, photographing the candles occasionally to send without words.\n**Why this fits you:** Offers a gentle, recurring ritual that quietly expresses your deep longing and love, especially toward distant family.\n**Time & materials:** Tea candles, matches.\n**First tiny step:** Light one candle tonight before bed.\n✨ **Ripples:** Quiet emotional presence, nurtures subtle intimacy.\n\n✅ Personal Symbolism  \n✅ Vulnerable Truth  \n✅ Gentle Subversion  \n✅ Multi-Layer Impact  \n✅ Playful Ritual  \n✅ Low Noise/High Meaning  \n✅ Tangible Trace  \n✅ Feasibility  \n✅ Emotional Depth  \n✅ Timing Resonance  \n✅ Sensory Engagement  \n✅ Identity Affirmation  \n\n**(12/12 checkmarks!)**\n\n---\n\n### 📚 Secret Bookmarks of Belonging\n**What:** Handcraft bookmarks inscribed with poetic lines or subtle personal symbols.
