This is not casual interest - Bilal is setting up a serious home cultivation system with liquid culture, agar plates, grain bags, and multiple sterilization methods. The intensity and technical depth suggests this is flow state work. Location marker: France. This connects to DIY/maker values seen in earlier conversations but at much greater scale and commitment."
