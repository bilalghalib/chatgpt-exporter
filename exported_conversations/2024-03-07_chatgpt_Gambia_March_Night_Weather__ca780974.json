      "content": "In Gambia, on average, the weather during the night of March 5th is relatively warm, with nighttime temperatures typically around 21°C (approximately 70°F). The daytime temperature in March can be much higher, averaging around 35°C (95°F). The humidity in March is about 50%, and there is very little rainfall, with an average of zero rainy days during the month. With these conditions, it is generally possible to sleep outside with only a blanket, especially considering the pleasant nighttime temperatures and low likelihood of rain【5†source】【6†source】【7†source】.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider personal comfort and the specific circumstances of your stay. Factors like the exact location within Gambia, the presence of mosquitoes, and your personal tolerance for varying temperatures and outdoor conditions should be taken into account. Additionally, it's a good idea to have a contingency plan in case of unexpected weather changes.",

Average daytime temperatures can reach around 35°C (95°F), which can feel quite warm, especially in areas without shade or air conditioning. The humidity level is about 50%, which can contribute to the overall perception of heat.\n\nGiven these conditions, it's advisable to prepare for a hot and sunny day. This means wearing light, breathable clothing, using sun protection like sunscreen and hats, and staying hydrated. It's also a good idea to seek shade during the hottest parts of the day and to be aware of any signs of heat exhaustion if you're spending extended periods outdoors【6†source】【7†source】.\n\nKeep in mind that these are average conditions, and actual weather can vary. It's always a good idea to check the local weather forecast closer to your visit for more accurate and up-to-date information.",
