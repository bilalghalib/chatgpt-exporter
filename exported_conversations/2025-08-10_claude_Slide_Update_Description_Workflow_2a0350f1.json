  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is working on a 5-day workshop presentation focused on energy-efficient building design in Iraq, specifically transitioning from a retrofit-focused approach to new build construction. They have developed a comprehensive workbook (v3) that includes client discovery processes, heritage principles integration, three design concepts (A/B/C), materials library, supplier network, AuditMyBEIT integration, 10-year total cost of ownership analysis, and a Goldilocks negotiation framework. The user requested detailed slide updates in JSON format to align their existing presentation with this new workbook structure.\n\nClaude analyzed the current slide deck and identified a major misalignment - the slides were still focused on retrofitting existing buildings while the workbook was designed for new construction projects. The user specifically requested updates in a \"slide update specification\" format that would transform the presentation day by day. Claude provided comprehensive recommendations for 25+ slides across all five days, including updates to existing slides, new slides to be added, and slides to be removed entirely.\n\nThe transformation involved shifting the entire workshop narrative from \"fixing problems in existing buildings\" to \"designing efficient new homes from scratch\" while maintaining evidence-based approaches. Key changes included replacing generic client scenarios with real WhatsApp client assignments, adding technical calculation demonstrations (U-values, UA method, heritage credits), integrating workbook tabs throughout the presentation, and restructuring the final day around competition judging criteria. The user preferred the final JSON format to use natural language descriptions rather than technical operation codes, asking for explanations like \"update the main text body to say...\" instead of technical terminology. Claude provided both detailed JSON specifications and summary implementation tables organized by priority levels to guide the slide revision process.",

The format is designed to be easy for an LLM to generate, especially for bulk updates across many slides.\n\nThe root of the JSON is an array of \"update objects.\" Each object targets a single slide index and contains a list of suggested operations.\n\n## JSON Structure\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"slide_index\": 2,\n    \"summary\": \"Update the Day 1 objective slide.\",\n    \"ops\": [\n      {\n        \"op\": \"SET_TITLE\",\n        \"value\": \"Today's ONE Output\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"op\": \"SET_BODY\",\n        \"value\": \"Complete Client Brief + Site Analysis\\n• Real client via WhatsApp\\n• Site constraints documented\\n• Program requirements clear\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"slide_index\": 31,\n    \"summary\": \"Add a new slide for the Site Analysis Template.\",\n    \"ops\": [\n      {\n        \"op\": \"ADD_SLIDE\",\n        \"value\": {\n          \"layout\": \"TITLE_AND_BODY\",\n          \"title\": \"Site Analysis Template\",\n          \"body\": \"Quick Site Constraints:\\n• Plot area: ___m²\\n• Max FAR: ___\n• Max GFA: =Plot_Area*FAR\n• Setbacks: F/S/R ___m\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Field Definitions\n\n### Update Object\n\n-   **`slide_index`** (Integer, Required): The 0-based index for the operation.\n    -   For `UPDATE` operations, this is the slide to modify.\n    -   For `ADD_SLIDE`, this is the index where the new slide will be inserted.\n-   **`summary`** (String, Required): A brief, human-readable summary of the changes.\n-   **`ops`** (Array of Objects, Required): A list of suggested operations.\n\n### Operation Object\n\n-   **`op`** (String, Required): The suggested high-level operation.\n-   **`target`** (String, Optional): The element to act upon (e.g., text to find for `REPLACE_TEXT`).\n-   **`value`** (String or Object, Optional): The new content for the operation.\n\n## Suggested Operations (`op`)\n\nThis is an extensible list of high-level operations an LLM can suggest.\n\n| `op`           | `target` Description                               | `value` Description                                                              |\n| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`ADD_SLIDE`**    | (Not used)                                         | An object representing the new slide, with `layout`, `title`, and `body` keys.   |\n| `SET_TITLE`    | (Not used)                                         | The new title for the slide.                                                     |\n| `SET_BODY`     | (Not used)                                         | The new body content for the slide.

Each team gets a real client contact.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  // New slide insertion\n  {\n    \"slide_index\": 31,\n    \"summary\": \"Insert new Site Analysis Template slide\",\n    \"ops\": [\n      {\n        \"op\": \"ADD_SLIDE\",\n        \"value\": {\n          \"layout\": \"TITLE_AND_BODY\",\n          \"title\": \"Site Analysis Template\",\n          \"body\": \"Quick Site Constraints:\\n• Plot area: ___m²\\n• Max FAR: ___\\n• Max GFA: =Plot_Area*FAR\\n• Setbacks: F/S/R ___m\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Phase 4: Content Integration Guidelines\n\n**Formula References:**\n- Use clear mathematical notation\n- Include units and definitions\n- Reference external calculation sheets\n\n**Workbook Integration:**\n- Specify which workbook tab/section each slide feeds\n- Include data flow directions (slide → workbook, workbook → slide)\n- Note calculation dependencies\n\n**Evidence Chain:**\n- Maintain traceability between slides and deliverables\n- Include photo/screenshot requirements\n- Specify documentation needed for each step\n\n### Processing Workflow Example\n\nGiven a strategic update document:\n\n1. **Parse the document** for slide-specific changes by day/section\n2. **Create a mapping table** showing old slide → new content → operation type\n3. **Generate JSON operations** in logical execution order\n4. **Validate completeness** by checking all mentioned slides are addressed\n5. **Test incremental execution** to ensure operations don't conflict\n\n### Quality Checklist\n\nBefore generating final JSON:\n- [ ] All referenced slide numbers are correct (0-based indexing)\n- [ ] New slides are inserted at appropriate positions\n- [ ] Content formatting preserves bullet points and structure\n- [ ] Formula references include proper notation\n- [ ] Cross-references between slides are updated\n- [ ] Speaker notes capture teaching moments and context\n- [ ] Evidence/deliverable requirements are clear\n\n```"

This changes everything. Let me rethink:\nDay 1: Client Discovery should be about:\n\nDream home vision\nFamily size and needs\nCurrent energy costs (maybe from current home)\nBudget for new construction\nSite constraints\nLifestyle preferences\n\nDay 2: Heritage Analysis needs to be about:\n\nFinding suppliers for materials\nCreating different design options with different U-values\nCalculating expected energy performance\nHeritage principles as design inspiration, not retrofit\n\nDay 3: Should be about developing multiple design options\nDay 4: Negotiation between options\nDay 5: Final pitch\nThe workbook needs to shift from retrofit phases to design options.
