Problems with focus and alignment\n2. Questions about higher purpose\n3. Issues with burnout and inclusion\n4. Concerns about measurement and effectiveness\n5. Questions about working with people vs \"material\"\n6. Problems with implementation and understanding\n\nThe second mind map explores the concept of \"Beauty\" and shows how it:\n1. Leads to love\n2. Guides to truth\n3. Asks to be witnessed\n4. Needs no justification\n5. Draws people naturally without compulsion\n6. Contains meaning and connects to deeper truth\n\nLooking at these together, I see several potential connections:\n\n1. **Purpose and Meaning**: While the first map shows tension around \"no higher purpose,\" the beauty map suggests that meaning emerges naturally through recognition of beauty. This could offer a different approach to purpose - one that's discovered rather than imposed.\n\n2. **Human Connection**: The first map mentions challenges with \"using people for things\" and tension between people and \"material.\" The beauty map suggests a more organic approach through concepts like \"asks to be witnessed\" and \"draws you without compulsion,\" which might offer a more harmonious way to think about human engagement.\n\n3. **Measurement vs. Natural Understanding**: Where the first map struggles with \"we don't know what works really,\" the beauty map suggests that truth and understanding can emerge through recognition of beauty - \"guides to truth\" and \"truth as a sign of something true.\"\n\n4. **Implementation**: The first map shows frustration with \"it's not working,\" while the beauty map suggests that when things are aligned with natural principles (beauty, truth, love), they tend to unfold more organically.\n\nWould you like me to explore any of these connections in more detail?

      "content": "Yeah, so I just lost another long rant where I was talking about how I wonder like if it's possible for beauty to actually be something that we can, you know, center our economic systems on and craft because I don't know how to bring craft back and like what is a crafty, you know, oil refinery, what is a crafty plastic injection mold making company, what is a crafty, well I guess it might be something there, crafty, you know, pick any of these, are there like industries that just seem like not very crafty, right? Like it's impossible to craft a mass produced yogurt box or something, right? Like is it just like those stuff shouldn't exist and everything should be more expensive or something like that. I was also talking about this realization that the thing, like I'm wondering what you think is at the center of this book. Is it beauty? Is it craft? Is it even economics? And who the book is for because the thing that I've been wondering about is, you know, like that thing that's missing is this focus on quality, right? Like everyone knows that they feel things, right? That there's a quality to experience that is more than the sum of its parts sometimes that, you know, like you see something so beautiful and it moves you to tears and it could be a surprise, you know? It could take you by surprise, this sudden perception of beauty and I feel like making time and space for these things is just not made available to most people and thus we are in this place where the world is telling us what the measures are and because there are all these objective measurable quantities, how much GDP? How much are you exporting? How many cars do you have? How many children do you have? How much money do you have? How big is your military? How many wars have you won? How many people died in your, you know, last attack? How many sports teams? The first to whatever, counting, right? And then there's the quality, like the presence we have with our family and loved ones, the enjoyment we have in making a loaf of sourdough bread and sharing it with the people we love. And I feel like so many people touched during the pandemic, literally sourdough, people did it and they're like, oh my god, this is amazing, you know? And I think there's a reason it's amazing, it's because we're made for this, we're made for relations, we're made for each other through ourselves, through what we can create and share and there's this kind of sense of meaninglessness, right? That everything is perfect and nothing is working, right? Like you have a metro system that really efficiently takes you from home to work where you don't want to go and then from tired from work to home where you just kind of rest and recharge and go back again. And for many people that's the case, it's like I need to do these things. And so there's like this other dichotomy of like need versus want, right? And when you do things that are connected to beauty and love and meaning, and you connect more with the feeling of love and this is highly motivating, I think. And it's like love of exploration and I think we can even connect it to some of the different types of cycles in the body like dopaminergic, which can take you into this process where you are, you know, set a goal and then you feel like you're making progress and so there's excitement and learning and then you achieve the goal versus other like hormones that are related to you know, wanting to rest and be in a state of like oxytocin and serotonin and these other types of things. And sure, like we need to learn, we need to have some goals and there's like some things that we need to do. But even that's debatable, right? I think it's possible to connect more our need to do's with our want to do's and make them intentional at the very least, right? And I was thinking also about this idea of like the arts, right? You look at the arts and we realize that like the arts are so important because they teach us and give us the space to open a portal to that felt sense, that quality of things, right? But schools like focus on STEAM or STEM education, STEAM at best, where arts are basically just like 3D printing and laser cutting and like you is seen as an add-on to make better science and technology, right? It's like, yeah, you know, like science and technology is the real thing, but like arts makes it even better. And that's, you can see that because it's like, it's not a perfect balance. It's like science, technology, engineering, and math, and they all have the same proportion. But in my opinion, they're basic, they could be like a 50-50 split between the arts and science, technology, engineering, and math, because the arts are basically a, the other half. It's the quality part of the quantity part. And the problem with our arts is that, you know, most people are here, they're trying to be famous and rich and because they believe that there's not enough, right? The world is this scarcity mindset, like what am I going to do for a job in the future? I have to be famous if I'm going to be an artist. And so it's ego-driven and not a craft. It's not an offering. It's not a service. It's not you opening up to that space of quality within you. And I think that like, there's a thing that we can do, like actually teach people how to be artistic. And to be artistic, it's basically just connecting and opening to that place of where love emerges from. And it requires attention and concentration and this ability to be present and aware. And this awareness is not really so easy to access in everyday life. And the place that I think we have a lot of, I think, sort of like, you know, replacements or surrogate kind of replacements for what we really are looking for. So for instance, like entertainment and movies, they do a great job at like gathering our attention and our awareness. And then because of that, we're able to use our movies. Movies are able to use that attention to get us into that place within us of quality. And it's because we have, what do they call it? A suspension of belief, right? And we're like, okay, you know, we live in a hyper-rational, materialistic world. But for a second, I'm going to pretend like I have a soul and that I can feel things. And it's in that place that we start to realize like our tears are flowing. We're connecting. We connect with each other. We connect with our feelings. We connect with the characters on the screen and the narratives. And I feel like this is such an important thing. And I'm wondering how can we bring some of that movie attention energy into the rest of our world, into our work, reconnecting with meaning, reconnecting with beauty and truth. And I see these things as all so connected, right? Like, I feel like that quality is, yeah. Can you tell me how these things are connected? I'm trying to figure it out. That's why I was making that graph and talking about how things are connected. Because I want to know what kind of book I'm writing and who it's for. Because right now, I have no idea. I just have all of these different feelings that seem like disconnected and connected at the same time. And I think about craft as like a potential avenue to think about this a little bit more deeply, but I can't see it yet. And I was wondering if you could help.",

Let me try to help connect these threads:\n\nThe core tension seems to be between two ways of engaging with the world:\n\n1. **Quantitative/Mechanistic**\n- Focused on measurable outputs (GDP, efficiency, profit)\n- Treats things and people as resources to be optimized\n- Leads to alienation and meaninglessness despite \"perfect\" systems\n- Creates a scarcity mindset and ego-driven behavior\n\n2. **Qualitative/Living**\n- Centered on beauty, craft, and felt meaning\n- Emerges from presence and attention\n- Creates connection and abundance\n- Allows for surprise and discovery\n\nWhat's interesting is that your example of sourdough bread-making during the pandemic illustrates a potential bridge: When people had space to slow down and engage with craft, they discovered something profound about quality and meaning. This suggests that craft could be a practical pathway to bring beauty and meaning into economic systems.\n\nRegarding your question about \"crafty\" industrial processes - perhaps the key isn't that everything needs to be artisanal, but rather that we need to reshape our relationship with production and consumption. Even in industrial settings, there could be:\n\n1. Craft in design and engineering\n2. Beauty in efficiency and elegance of systems\n3. Meaning in purpose and service\n4. Quality in attention to detail and care\n\nYour book seems to be exploring a fundamental question: How do we create economic and social systems that honor both quantity and quality? That allow for both efficiency and beauty? That serve both material needs and spiritual/emotional needs?\n\nThe audience might be:\n1. People feeling the disconnect between meaningful work and economic necessity\n2. Leaders looking to transform organizations and systems\n3. Anyone seeking to bridge the gap between craft/beauty and modern economic realities\n\nThe central thesis might be that beauty and quality aren't luxury add-ons to efficient systems, but rather essential elements of truly sustainable and life-giving economies. Craft could be the practical framework for implementing this vision - not just in traditional artisanal work, but as a way of approaching all types of work and production.\n\nWould you find it helpful if I created a visual map showing these relationships and potential pathways forward?
