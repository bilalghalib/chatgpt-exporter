  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user requested a comprehensive review and extraction of interview data from Iraqi solar market research to support solar training development in Mosul, Iraq. They specifically wanted to identify the training process steps, extract all relevant local Iraqi numbers including generator costs, energy usage patterns, component pricing, and technical considerations, then organize this information into usable tables with original Arabic quotes as evidence for ground-truth verification.\n\nClaude conducted an extensive analysis of interview summaries and training materials, using project knowledge search and attempting to access Excel workbooks containing Iraqi solar market data. The analysis revealed critical market insights including that generator costs in Mosul have doubled from 5,000 to 10,000-12,000 IQD per amp in just one year, customers think in amps rather than kWh, and there's a significant quality crisis with fake components causing installations to fail.\n\nClaude created four comprehensive artifacts: a detailed ground-truth data compilation with 10 tables covering everything from generator costs to installation best practices with Arabic quotes and interview sources; a complete training process and implementation guide structured around a 5-day curriculum; critical training adaptations based on Iraqi market realities addressing issues like the 49°C operating temperature and dust conditions; and a quick reference card with essential conversions, pricing guides, and safety protocols. The work emphasized the importance of using amp-based calculations since Iraqi customers request service in amps (like \"10 amps day, 5 amps night\"), incorporating local success stories and failure examples, and adapting standard solar training to address Iraq-specific challenges like extreme heat, dust, fake components, and rapid cost changes in the generator market.\n\n**Tool Knowledge**\n\nThe project knowledge search tool proved effective for extracting interview data using specific Iraqi market terms. Searches combining technical terms with local context like \"Iraqi solar interview energy costs generator price grid electricity amps\" and \"Mosul generator price 5000 10000 12000 IQD interview heat dust temperature\" yielded the most relevant results. When searching for pricing data, including specific currency amounts and ranges like \"500000 200000 150000 generator monthly cost battery replacement payback\" helped locate exact cost figures from interviews. The tool worked better with Arabic transliterations and local terminology rather than generic solar industry terms. For accessing Excel workbooks through the repl tool, the XLSX library import approach was attempted but encountered file access limitations, making the project knowledge search the primary reliable method for extracting structured interview data and market research findings.",

Common voltages:\n\n12V DC (small systems)\n\n24V or 48V DC (larger solar systems)\n\n220V AC (typical household appliances and generators in Iraq)\n\nLet’s calculate amps for each voltage:\n\nVoltage\tCurrent = 750W ÷ V\tResulting Amps\n12V DC\t750 ÷ 12\t62.5 A\n24V DC\t750 ÷ 24\t31.25 A\n48V DC\t750 ÷ 48\t15.6 A\n220V AC\t750 ÷ 220\t3.4 A\n\n🔄 Comparing to generators:\nGenerators are usually rated in kVA or kW, and their output amperage depends on voltage:\n\nA 3 kVA generator at 220V supplies:\n3,000W ÷ 220V = ~13.6 A\n\nYour solar roof gives ~750W average usable power\n→ at 220V: 3.4 A\n→ at 12V: 62.5 A\n\nSo your solar system is:\n\nRoughly 1/4th the output of a 3 kVA generator in energy terms.\n\nComparable to a small generator (0.75–1 kVA)\n\n🧠 Key Notes:\nSolar output is over the course of the day (peaks midday), not constant like a generator.\n\nYou need batteries and inverters to get steady AC amps.\n\nAmps depend on the system’s voltage design, so always specify the voltage when asking about amps.\n\n⚡ Summary (Assuming 750W average):\nVoltage\tAmps\n12V\t62.5 A\n24V\t31.25 A\n48V\t15.6 A\n220V\t3.4 A\n\nWould you like to calculate this based on actual panel area or generator comparison by hour/day use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nsorry that was per month \n\n\nChatGPT said:\nAh! If your solar radiation potential is 1,370 kWh per month, not per year, then your energy generation potential is much higher. Let’s recalculate everything step by step:\n\n🧮 Step 1: Convert kWh/month → W (watts)\n1,370 kWh/month\n→ per day: 1,370 ÷ 30 ≈ 45.7 kWh/day\n→ assuming ~5 peak sun hours per day (typical for Iraq):\n45.7 kWh ÷ 5 h ≈ 9.14 kW average usable power\n→ in watts: 9,140 W\n\n🔌 Step 2: Convert Watts to Amps at Different Voltages\n(Using: Current = Power ÷ Voltage)\n\nVoltage\tAmps = 9,140 ÷ V\tResulting Amps\n12V DC\t9,140 ÷ 12\t761.7 A\n24V DC\t9,140 ÷ 24\t380.8 A\n48V DC\t9,140 ÷ 48\t190.4 A\n220V AC\t9,140 ÷ 220\t41.5 A\n\n🔄 Generator Comparison\nIf your solar system outputs 9.14 kW average during sunny hours:\n\nGenerator Size\tApprox Amps at 220V\n10 kVA\t10,000 ÷ 220 ≈ 45 A\n5 kVA\t5,000 ÷ 220 ≈ 22.7 A\n\nSo your solar roof output (monthly potential) is similar to a 9–10 kVA generator running for 5 hours/day.\n\n⚠️ Important Notes\nThis is average usable power assuming good system design, minimal losses.\n\nActual amps you “see” depend on inverter setup (DC to AC), voltage design, storage, etc.\n\nIn Iraq, 220V AC is standard, so you'd use an inverter to convert DC to AC, and expect ~41 amps during peak hours from your system.\n\n✅ Summary (for 1,370 kWh/month solar potential):\nVoltage\tAmps Output During Peak\n12V DC\t762 A\n24V DC\t381 A\n48V DC\t190 A\n220V AC\t41.5 A\n\nLet me know your panel size, inverter size, or how much of this you want to actually install — and I can help design the system and compare costs too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nok, how much can we expect for an average home's draw if the rest goes to battery, is it enough or do we need to supplement with a generator?\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nGreat question — let’s break it down into realistic daily energy needs for a typical Iraqi home, and then compare it to your solar potential (1,370 kWh/month).\n\n🏠 1. Average Iraqi Home Energy Consumption\nTypical daily usage ranges from 5 to 15 kWh/day, depending on:\n\nAppliance\tDaily Use Estimate\nLighting (LEDs)\t0.5 – 1 kWh\nFridge\t1 – 2 kWh\nFans / Ceiling Fans\t0.5 – 2 kWh\nTV / Electronics\t0.5 – 1 kWh\nWashing Machine (if used)\t1 kWh (every other day)\nWater Pump\t0.5 – 1.5 kWh\nAir Conditioner (summer)\t2 – 5 kWh\n\n➡️ Total: 6–12 kWh/day, or about 180–360 kWh/month for a modest household.\n\n🔋 2. Your Solar Potential: 1,370 kWh/month\nLet’s assume 80% efficiency after system losses:\n\n1,370 × 0.8 = 1,096 kWh usable/month\n\nThat’s ~36.5 kWh/day available on average.\n\nThat’s 3–6× more than a typical home needs!\n\nSo yes — your solar radiation potential is more than enough to power one full home and still have energy left to:\n\nCharge batteries\n\nPower appliances during the day\n\nShare with neighbors or sell to grid (if possible)\n\n🔄 3. Do You Still Need a Generator?\n✅ YES, IF:\n\nYou have no or small battery bank (for night-time or cloudy days)\n\nYou run heavy appliances at night (like multiple A/Cs or heaters)\n\nYou live in an area with frequent dust or shading that reduces solar output\n\nYou expect multiple cloudy days in a row in winter\n\n❌ NO, IF:\n\nYou have a well-sized battery system\n\nYou stagger high-consumption use to the daylight hours\n\nYou use inverter A/Cs, solar water heaters, efficient fridges, and LED lighting\n\n⚡ Recommendation\nSystem Element\tRecommendation\nSolar Array\tAt least 3–5 kW to match your roof potential\nInverter\t5 kW+ hybrid inverter (solar + grid + battery)\nBattery Bank\t10–15 kWh usable storage (e.g., 4× 3.5 kWh LFP batteries)\nGenerator (optional)\t3–5 kVA backup, auto-start if budget allows\n\nWith this setup, solar will cover 80–100% of your needs, and the generator fills the gap on rare cloudy days or maintenance.\n\nWould you like:\n\nA sample wiring diagram?\n\nA battery sizing calculator?\n\nHelp estimating cost of such a system in Iraq?\n\nLet me know your home size, family size, and which appliances you use most — and I can give a more precise design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nwhat's the minimum sized battery - and do we really only need 5kW inverter? - how do we make that calculation\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nGreat! Let's work through this together clearly and step by step. You're asking two excellent and related questions:\n\n✅ 1. How to Size the Inverter\n➤ Rule of Thumb:\nYour inverter size (in kW) should roughly match your peak power demand, not your total daily consumption.\n\n🔌 Step-by-Step:\na. List all major appliances that might run at the same time\nFor example (typical middle-class Iraqi home):\n\nAppliance\tPower (W)\nRefrigerator\t150 W\nLights (LEDs, 5 rooms)\t100 W\nTV + Wi-Fi\t150 W\nCeiling Fans (2)\t140 W\nWashing Machine\t500 W\nAC Unit (1.5 Ton)\t1,500 W\nWater Pump\t800 W\n\n➡️ Total simultaneous load:\n150 + 100 + 150 + 140 + 500 + 1,500 + 800 = ~3,340 W = 3.3 kW\n\nb. Add 25–30% safety margin\n→ 3.3 kW × 1.3 ≈ 4.3 kW\n\n✅ Recommendation:\n5 kW inverter is a good minimum size for most homes.\nIt handles normal daily use plus some margin for:\n\nSurge loads (motors, fridges, pumps)\n\nFuture expansion\n\n❗ If you plan two ACs or large electric ovens, go up to 7–8 kW.\n🔋 2. How to Size the Battery Bank\nBatteries are sized in kWh, not kW.\n\n🔋 Step-by-Step:\na. How many hours of backup do you need?\nLet’s say: Nighttime (6–10 hours)\n\nb. Estimate critical night-time loads\nE.g., Fridge, lights, fans, maybe one AC for a few hours:\n\nAppliance\tDaily Runtime\tEnergy Use (kWh)\nFridge (24h)\talways on\t1.2 kWh\nLights & fans\t4–6 hrs\t1.0–1.5 kWh\nTV + Wi-Fi\t2–3 hrs\t0.3 kWh\nAC (3 hrs at night)\t3 hrs\t3.0–4.0 kWh\n\n➡️ Estimated total night use: 5–7 kWh\n\nc. Depth of Discharge & Safety\nUse only 80–90% of lithium battery to protect lifespan.\n\nSo:\n\nNeed 7 kWh usable → Install at least 8–9 kWh total\n\nWith safety margin: 10–12 kWh battery is ideal\n\n✅ Battery Recommendation:\nBattery Type\tSize\tNotes\nLithium (LFP)\t10–12 kWh\tBest performance & lifespan\nLead Acid (Flooded or Gel)\t12–14 kWh\tCheaper, but lower efficiency, heavier\nModular Systems\te.g., 3.5 kWh × 3\tFlexible expansion possible\n\n⚖️ Summary\nComponent\tRecommended Minimum\nInverter\t5 kW hybrid inverter\nBattery\t10–12 kWh Lithium (or 14+ kWh Lead)\nSolar Input\tEnough panels to cover ~40–50 kWh/day (~8–10 kW system)\n\nWould you like me to build a sample setup and cost estimate for Iraq (with or without generator), including real brands and prices if available?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nyeah can you do a example setup for my home, how many panels, what inverter, what batteries, what sized cables, what bms, what other parts might i need, battery housing, etc, rack to hold things, what angle, what azimuth, what other considerations \n\n\nChatGPT said:\nUpdated saved memory\nExcellent! Here's a practical, grounded example setup for a complete solar power system for your home in Iraq, assuming:\n\nDaily household consumption: 10–12 kWh/day\n\nDesire for battery backup (overnight usage)\n\nGrid is unreliable, but generator optional\n\nRoof space is available (flat or angled)\n\nLocation: Iraq (e.g., Mosul, Baghdad, etc.), ~5.5 peak sun hours/day\n\n☀️ 1. Solar Panels\n✅ Goal: Generate ~45 kWh/day → Needs ~8.2 kW of panel capacity\nItem\tValue\nPanel Wattage\t550 W (mono PERC half-cut panels, common now)\nPanels Needed\t8,250 W ÷ 550 W ≈ 15 panels\nArea Needed\t~2 m² per panel × 15 = ~30 m²\n\n➡️ 15 × 550W panels = 8.25 kW system\n\n⚙️ 2. Inverter\n✅ Needs to handle:\nMax load: ~3.5–4.5 kW\n\nCharging batteries + powering home\n\nGrid/generator input + solar\n\nRecommendation\tSpecs\n5 kW Hybrid Inverter (Growatt, Victron, Solis, Luxpower, Voltronic)\t48V system, MPPT 120–500V DC input, 2 MPPT trackers, WiFi monitoring\nWhy hybrid?\tHandles grid, generator, solar, and battery inputs together\n\n🔋 3. Battery Bank\n✅ Goal: Store 10–12 kWh usable energy\nOption\tSpecs\tNotes\n3× 48V 100Ah LiFePO₄ batteries\t48V × 100Ah = 4.8 kWh each\t~14.4 kWh total, 90% usable → 13 kWh\nBrands\tPylontech, Hubble, Narada, Shoto, or even assembled packs (local providers)\t\n\nConsider rack-mount models for safety & modularity\n\n🔌 4. Cabling\nCorrect cable sizing ensures minimal voltage drop (under 3%). Here's a rough guide:\n\nConnection\tType\tMin Cable Size\nPanels → Inverter (DC)\t4–6 mm² solar cable\t6 mm² preferred for 8kW strings\nInverter → Batteries (DC)\t25–35 mm²\tShorter is better; fused\nInverter → AC Load (AC)\t4–6 mm²\tDepends on load distance and power\n\n✅ Use MC4 connectors and DC breakers for safety and maintenance.\n\n⚠️ 5. BMS (Battery Management System)\nIf you're using off-the-shelf batteries (Pylontech, Narada, etc.), they come with integrated BMS.\n\nIf you're assembling packs, get a:\n\nSmart BMS for LiFePO₄\n\nBluetooth monitoring (e.g., Daly, JBD, JK BMS)\n\nMust be sized for 48V and >100A discharge\n\n🧰 6. Other Components\nItem\tDescription\nCombiner Box / DC Disconnect\tFuses & breakers for solar strings\nBattery Disconnect Switch\tSafety switch for battery bank\nSurge Protector\tFor both AC and DC sides\nGrounding & Earthing Rods\tCrucial for safety\nMonitoring System\tMany inverters include WiFi/app, Victron has Cerbo GX if advanced\nGenerator Input (Optional)\tAuto-start feature if needed\nATS (Automatic Transfer Switch)\tSwitch between grid/generator/solar if needed\nCircuit breakers\tSized per load and voltage, usually DIN-rail mount\n\n🧱 7. Battery Housing\nOption\tNotes\nMetal Rack Enclosure\tFor rack-mount batteries, with ventilation\nFireproof Battery Box\tIf near living areas; especially for DIY packs\nWell-ventilated battery room\tCool, dry, out of direct sun — lithium prefers 15–30°C\n\n🧭 8. Panel Mounting, Angle, Azimuth\nFeature\tRecommendation for Iraq\nAzimuth (Direction)\tSouth (±15° ok)\nTilt Angle\tLatitude × 0.9 → ~30–35° tilt (for most of Iraq)\nMount Type\tAdjustable tilt mount (if seasonal adjustment), or fixed frame\nWind Load Protection\tReinforced racking or ballast if rooftop flat\n\n🧾 9.

Updated ROI\nScenario\tTotal Cost (25 yrs)\tComparison\nGrid + generator mix\t$12,050\t—\nSolar system\t$16,000\t—\n💡 Net cost difference\t+ $3,950\tSolar costs more over 25 years\n\n⚖️ ROI Analysis:\nYearly comparison:\n\nSolar breaks even in ~33 years vs. grid+generator — longer than panel lifespan.\n\nLifetime ROI (25 years): solar earns −$3,950, meaning a net loss financially compared to current hybrid costs.\n\n🧠 5. But Why Solar Still Wins\nEven if purely financial ROI is negative, solar delivers significant benefits:\n\nEnergy independence & reliability — no more reliance on our troubled grid or fluctuating fuel prices.\n\nConsistent supply, day and night.\n\nEnvironmental and air‑pollution benefits — replacing diesel generators.\n\nLong-term protection from future price hikes in fuel or electricity.\n\n🔧 6. Optimizing the Payback\nYou can tilt the ROI favorably by:\n\nReducing battery replacement cost via bulk purchasing or local production.\n\nHybridizing with a smaller generator to reduce battery size.\n\nTaking advantage of possible subsidies or incentives for solar.\n\nPanel upgrades—higher efficiency panels can reduce upfront cost.\n\n✅ Summary Table\nMetric\tGrid+Generator\tSolar System\nInitial Setup Cost\t$0 + generator\t$16,000\nYearly Cost\t$482\t$0 (fuel/electricity free)\n25-Year Total Cost\t$12,050\t$16,000\nROI Over 25 Years\t—\t−$3,950\n\n📌 Your Next Steps\nDo you want me to run scenarios with fuel price inflation, increasing outages, or smaller system sizes?\n\nShall we estimate a hybrid solar+generator setup to balance cost and reliability?\n\nWant to investigate local subsidies or financing options in Iraq?\n\nHappy to refine again based on what matters most to you—costs, independence, or sustainability!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\nYou said:\nthat was for winter irradiation, in the summer the rooftop gets 2,904 ( kWh ) in july - how does that change our calcualtions?\n\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nAnalyzed\npython\nAlways show details\n\nCopy\n# Recalculating solar output based on July's potential\n# Given: 2,904 kWh in July = ~93.7 kWh/day\n\njuly_kwh_per_month = 2904\njuly_daily_output = july_kwh_per_month / 31  # daily solar generation in July\n\n# Household daily usage\ndaily_usage = 12  # kWh\n\n# Calculate surplus and self-sufficiency\njuly_surplus = july_daily_output - daily_usage\njuly_self_sufficiency = daily_usage / july_daily_output\n\n# Financial comparison: assume full offset of grid + generator during July\ngrid_cost_per_kwh = 0.015  # USD\ngenerator_cost_per_kwh = 0.30  # USD\ngrid_hours = 8\ngenerator_hours = 4\n\n# Cost without solar in July\ngrid_kwh = 8\ngenerator_kwh = daily_usage - grid_kwh\njuly_daily_cost_without_solar = (grid_kwh * grid_cost_per_kwh) + (generator_kwh * generator_cost_per_kwh)\njuly_total_cost_without_solar = july_daily_cost_without_solar * 31\n\n# Cost with solar (assume batteries cover night)\njuly_total_cost_with_solar = 0  # Assuming full coverage\n\nresults_july = {\n    \"Daily Solar Generation (July)\": f\"{july_daily_output:.1f} kWh\",\n    \"Surplus Energy per Day (July)\": f\"{july_surplus:.1f} kWh\",\n    \"Self-sufficiency in July\": f\"{july_self_sufficiency*100:.1f}%\",\n    \"Monthly Energy Cost without Solar (July)\": f\"${july_total_cost_without_solar:.0f}\",\n    \"Monthly Energy Cost with Solar (July)\": f\"${july_total_cost_with_solar:.0f}\",\n    \"Savings in July\": f\"${july_total_cost_without_solar - july_total_cost_with_solar:.0f}\",\n}\n\nresults_july\nResult\n{'Daily Solar Generation (July)': '93.7 kWh',\n 'Surplus Energy per Day (July)': '81.7 kWh',\n 'Self-sufficiency in July': '12.8%',\n 'Monthly Energy Cost without Solar (July)': '$41',\n 'Monthly Energy Cost with Solar (July)': '$0',\n 'Savings in July': '$41'}\nIn July, your rooftop solar system performs extremely well — here's how the summer solar potential changes the picture:\n\n☀️ July Solar Output (2,904 kWh/month)\nDaily generation: 93.7 kWh/day\n\nYour household needs: 12 kWh/day\n\nDaily surplus: 81.7 kWh/day\n\nSelf-sufficiency: Only 12.8% of your solar is needed to power your home — the rest is surplus\n\nYou could easily power 7–8 homes with your July rooftop potential.\n\n💸 Financial Impact (July)\nScenario\tCost\nWithout Solar\t$41 (mixed grid + generator)\nWith Solar (fully covered)\t$0\nSavings in July\t$41 just for this month\n\n🧠 Interpretation\nYou're fully self-sufficient in summer, with tons of surplus.\n\nIf net metering or battery-sharing were available, you could sell or store this excess.\n\nBattery storage becomes critical to capture and use this surplus at night or in winter.\n\nWould you like to:\n\nSimulate winter + summer hybrid performance?\n\nModel battery size needed to store the surplus 81.7 kWh/day?\n\nExplore how to share or sell excess solar with neighbors?\n\nLet me know how you’d like to build on this. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI'd like to resize and find the ideal setup that has a positive ROI - I am also dubious about the calculations you had for the generator and the gov power - can you do some more research to see what people actually are paying and then let's redo the ROI calculations with the 26,245 kWh/Year*\nRESULTS\nPrint Results\n\nMonth\tSolar Radiation\n( kWh / m2 / day )\nAC Energy\n( kWh )\nJanuary\t3.14\t1,319\nFebruary\t3.76\t1,395\nMarch\t5.30\t2,143\nApril\t6.36\t2,393\nMay\t7.19\t2,741\nJune\t7.96\t2,872\nJuly\t7.95\t2,904\nAugust\t7.68\t2,830\nSeptember\t7.06\t2,572\nOctober\t5.33\t2,086\nNovember\t4.09\t1,620\nDecember\t3.29\t1,370\nAnnual\t5.76\t26,245\n\nData\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nLet's update the ROI analysis using real-world energy data for Mosul and your annual solar production of 26,245 kWh/year.

Also describe the difference in the system now that we changed it. Is it going to be the same for the consumer, is it possible that it can be increased if/when generator/grid costs increase or would we need another size up in inerter etc\n\n\nChatGPT said:\nHere’s a clearer, Mosul-focused breakdown to better reflect your situation — including amp-based generator costs, all associated fees, and the solar system adjustments:\n\n🔌 Generator   💡 \"Ampere\" Billing in Mosul\nIn Mosul (and much of Iraq), private generators bill by ampere of supply, not by energy used:\n\nExample from Baghdad (similar model) \naljazeera.com\n:\n\nDaytime (12–1 h) = 6,000 IQD/amp (~$4.10)\n\nNight (0–6 h) = 9,000 IQD/amp (~$6.10)\n\n24‑hour “golden” = 12,000 IQD/amp (~$8.10)\n\nUnsubsidized/fuel‑only adds 1,000–2,000 IQD more\n\nA 10‑amp line (typical home) costs:\n\nDay rate ≈ $41/day\n\nNight rate ≈ $61/day\n\n💶 Many pay $60–100/month for a 10 A connection \nshafaq.com\naljazeera.com\n, regardless of usage.\n\n💡 Generator owners also add fuel & maintenance fees, plus enforcement/regulation costs \nleegov.com\nleegov.com\n+13\nshafaq.com\n+13\nunitedrentals.com\n+13\n.\n\n🏠 How Many Amps Do Homes Need?\nHere's a rough breakdown of required amperage (assuming 220 V service):\n\nLoad\tPower (W)\tAmps at 220 V\nLights, fridge, fans, TV\t1,000\t~4.5 A\nWater pump\t800\t~3.6 A\nAC unit (1.5 ton)\t1,500\t~6.8 A\nTotal peak\t~3,300\t~15 A\n\n🧠 Most households subscribe to 10–15 A lines, though peak needs might exceed — but fuse limits cap you.\n\n💸 Generator & Grid Costs Combined\nLet's assume:\n\n10 A connection\n\nMix of day/night billing (average 7,500 IQD ≈ $5.10 per amp)\n\n& fuel/maint mainly covered\n\n→ 10 A × $5.10 = $51/day, even if you don’t fully draw it.\n\nMonthly: $1,530, Annual: $18,360!\n\n🧮 Revised ROI Comparison vs. Solar\n🟦 Traditional Supply Costs\nAnnual generator bill alone: $18,360\n\nGrid payment (if any) may be negligible in winter.\n\n🟩 Optimized Solar Setup\nPanels & hybrid inverter: $6,000\n\n5 kWh battery + BOS: $2,000\n\nTotal investment: $8,000\n\nBattery replacements: +$2,400\n\nLifetime cost: $10,400\n\n📈 Return\nSolar offsets full generator cost: saves ~$18,360/year\n\nPayback period: ~$8,000 ÷ $18,360 ≈ 5 months\n\n25‑year ROI: Huge — solar yields ~4.8× return, or ~$335,000 saved\n\n🔄 Impact on Consumer System & Sizing\nYour system stays largely the same:\n\n5 kW hybrid inverter\n\n5 kWh battery\n\n5 kW panel array\n\nBut with this billing model:\n\n💰 You see tremendous cost savings — paying generator fees outstrips solar setup easily.\n\n📈 If generator rates or outages worsen, your savings increase.\n\n✅ Future scaling? You can upgrade panels or batteries without changing inverter — as long as capacity limit ~5 kW solar input is respected.\n\n🧭 Comprehensive Cost Summary\nExpense\tAnnual Cost\nGenerator subs (10 A)\t$18,360\nSolar system investment\t$8,000 (one-time)\nBattery replacement\t$2,400 (over 25 yrs)\nNet annual savings\t$18,360\n\n🕓 ROI timeline: ~5 months\n📅 Over 25 years: ~$335k saved after costs\n\n✅ Final Insights & Next Steps\nYou pay by amp — not kWh — so unsused capacity is wasted cost.\n\nSolar bypasses that whole expense.\n\nYour new system can easily scale; higher future generator costs just improve ROI.\n\nYou avoid fuel and generator maintenance fees entirely.\n\nWould you like help drafting the contract or rate negotiation with generator provider or designing a solar+amp-based tariff plan?"

Or when you want to convince them to go to Solar, is\nit for them to leave?\\\n\\\n00:35:45 SPK_2\\\n. I read, I mean, there was an article that economically, let\\'s say,\nit\\'s considered for homes, I mean, when you come to sell my home with\nsolar, its price will be higher than a normal home, I mean, this is\nsomething, how is this an addition to the home, I mean, it will add to\nits price, this is the point of its longevity. Yes, there are many other\ndetails, the generator, the subject of the generator is annoying, but\nthe only barrier that people face in heading towards the system, is that\nthere is a required amnesty amount from me, an amount, yes, my money,\nyes, a one-time payment, for example, \\$10,000, okay, yes, so the\nsubject is that this barrier is always what stands in their way. Another\nthing is that we, in reality or from the reality that we have made and\nour experience, when we want to convince and be blessed, we always tell\nthem so-and-so, whether he is from their region or from. Who? From their\ncity, for example, when we currently work with, for example, farmers or\ninspectors. It is so-and-so who did this, or succeeded in it, he\nactually succeeded, we do not talk about something in you or something\nthat is actually achieved that something succeeded, yes, good, this\nencourages it a lot, right? Yes? I mean, it exists in some areas, and\nso-and-so did, why shouldn't I do it, so this becomes a very high\nmotivation, we see it, maybe I personally see it, no, why did so-and-so\ndo it, if I do it, it might be that so-and-so's budget is different from\nmine, or that I do not need so-and-so to do this thing, so if I do it, I\nsee that I need it, if I go and do it, but they don't, I mean some of\nthem sometimes, no, it works in Iraq, it works a lot. Ok, we saw it from\nmore than one side, I mean\\\n\\\n00:37:54 SPK_1\\\nYes, it\\'s good, so we need a case, I mean, close to them, thank God,\nMosul has a lot of materials, I mean, what are the prices these days for\nmaterials, and with companies that I\\'m present in Iraq? And if so, we\nwant to see, I mean?\\\n\\\n00:38:17 SPK_2\\\nIt changes, but from what I remember, the 520 was priced at around\n\\$200, okay, depending on its size, but around \\$500 to \\$700. Lithium\nbatteries. Ethiom ion batteries last approximately, yes. They last\napproximately ten years. Ben Benrah 15. Yes, sorry, between \\$1,500 and\n\\$2,000. That\\'s something for a single battery, but there will be\nflexibility, yes, there was a very dominant company, a Chinese company,\nI don\\'t remember its name?\\\n\\\n00:39:22 SPK_1\\\n. Yes, and now these prices are from\\\n\\\n00:39:24 SPK_2\\\n. This company in this format, I don\\'t remember the name well? This is\neverything. But it differs, I mean, according to. According to the\ncompanies, I mean\\\n\\\n00:39:36 SPK_1 .\\\nI mean, this is a local industry, it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s normal, right?\\\n\\\n00:39:45 SPK_2 .\\\nLocal.",

Distribute case study packets for \"Your cousin's 150m² house\"  \n3. Explain the audit process and deliverables  \n4. Have teams complete a thorough load assessment  \n5. Circulate to provide guidance and answer questions\n\n**What to Say:** \"Now you'll apply what you've learned by conducting a full energy audit for your 'cousin's house.' This 150m² home in East Mosul has a typical family of six with the usual appliances. You'll create a complete load profile, just as you would for a real client.\n\nInterview your teammates as if they were the homeowners. Ask detailed questions: 'How many hours do you run the refrigerator? Do you use the washing machine daily or weekly? What time of day do you need air conditioning?' The more specific your questions, the more accurate your assessment will be.\"\n\n**Stories to Share:** \"One trainee from last year used this exact exercise to design a system for his actual cousin's house the week after training. Because he had practiced the conversation during training, he knew exactly what questions to ask. He uncovered that his cousin was planning to buy a new air conditioner the following month—which would have made his initial system design completely inadequate. This discovery saved him from an embarrassing failure.\"\n\n### **System Size Estimation (30 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Prepare system sizing worksheets  \n* Have component price lists from local suppliers  \n* Create comparison charts for different system configurations\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Guide teams through converting their load assessment to a system design  \n2. Have them determine panel count, battery capacity, and inverter size  \n3. Ask them to create a component list with local prices  \n4. Calculate total system cost and generate an estimated quote  \n5. Determine payback period compared to generator use\n\n**What to Say:** \"Based on your load assessment, you'll now design an appropriate system. Remember Dr. Nasih's advice to focus on homes around 150m² for your first designs. These smaller residential systems are perfect starting points before tackling more complex commercial projects.\n\nFor a typical Mosul home, we recommend a battery bank that can cover at least 12 hours of essential loads. Why? Because grid outages commonly last 8-12 hours, and generator service is usually limited to evening hours. Your system should bridge these gaps reliably.\"\n\n**Financial Context:** \"When calculating payback period, remember that most Mosul households spend between 100,000-200,000 IQD monthly on generator service. A properly sized solar system typically costs 10-15 million IQD but eliminates most of this recurring expense. This means a payback period of 4-6 years for residential systems, after which the client enjoys essentially free electricity for years.\"",

In any subject, now if you are working on your subject that\nyou said I work on the subject of design and yes training and such, the\nfirst question you might have is yes do you currently have a course that\nyou are training or not? Of course you will say I might be a month ago\nor I might have a plan after a month, yes if you are in this subject,\neither you have done it or you will do it, yes correct, okay, in our\nfield anyone who works on this subject if it is not the first thing he\nstarts with himself, I mean I start, I have a system that I use at home,\nand then I can educate him and say, dad, this system works this way, it\nworks, yes, right, yes its problems and challenges are this, and I\neducate him on whether we go in its direction or not, why?\\\n\\\n00:13:25 SPK_1\\\n. You have a chest at home\\\n\\\n00:13:27 SPK_2\\\n. At home it has been more than three and a half years. Leaving the\nline, the generator is called the region's generator and so on.

After that, after they increased, they increased the price, meaning\\\n\\\n00:14:03 SPK_2\\\nNo, no, it\\'s not. This is the challenge, now if this issue escalates,\nyes, people don\\'t just think. They think ten times about working on the\nsubject of solar energy. Yes, it appears yes, yes, yes, if you saw a\nlesson, yes, this is necessary?\\\n\\\n00:14:16 SPK_1\\\n. They change the prices\\\n\\\n00:14:18 SPK_2\\\nYeah, the tariff yeah, because it\\'s the tariff, really, you know why\nwhen they raise it you know, because sometimes I\\'m close to the\ndecision maker, because I, you know, I worked for long periods, yeah,\nyeah, with men on committees with the advisory body, the Council of\nMinisters, on the subject of solar\\\n\\\nenergy\\\n\\\n,\\\nyeah\\\n\\... I am not affected, I am punishing anyone who pays this electricity\nbill. I tell him I will increase his electricity bill and he must pay\nmore. This means he is saying you are punishing me in return. Whoever\ndoes not pay is not subject to the law, or he does not pay these\namounts. Now there is a keenness on the issue that everyone must have a\nmeter as the first step, and then there will be the issue of controlling\nthe tariff, and certainly the segments whose social, yes, material level\nis low will not be affected by the few amperes or kilowatts, the happier\nyou are, the more there is an increase in the issue of the rate of\npricing.",

Yes, good, but this is the entire payment, not just the extra \\$1,000.\nIf I were now to try to imagine someone who would try to make a\ndecision.\\\n\\\n00:21:16 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n.

Yes, just the price of the\nbatteries. Do you know that the batteries will be the most consumed\npart? Yes?\\\n\\\n00:21:31 BILAL\\\nThat\\'s it. But for the \\$1,000, seriously, see if what does one say to\nthe customer? How will he know if he should do it? What? Is this talk?\nAnd how do you deal with the customer with this idea?\\\n\\\n00:21:49 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. No problem? I\\'ll get back to you. But let me tell you about the\njoyful thing, which is that for you, this is for the residents, for the\ncommercial business owners? The value that they made of every solar\npanel system, we came back through a maximum of two years\\\n\\\n00:22:04 BILAL\\\n. The good thing about two years is the gradual increase in the price of\nelectricity, and they are high, right? I mean higher\\\n\\\n00:22:13 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Is it possible for the price of 1 \\* 10 E, the commercial price is 60\nE? And then it reaches a certain point and it gets hit again. So, the\ncommercial person in particular, who pulls it, for example, above two\nhundred, is the environment. It will increase, meaning Bashar is almost\nno less than 1,000,000\\\n\\\n00:22:33 BILAL\\\n. Iraqi dinars\\\n\\\n00:22:34 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Yes, on my country. Your births are on 2,000,000, 2,000,000. Half as\nwell. You charge 2,000,000 or half of 12. 100, meaning almost 3,000,000\\\n\\\n00:22:49 BILAL\\\n. And the farms\\\n\\\n00:22:49 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. 1,000,000 means 20,000 dollars, with which he can install an excellent\nsystem.\\\n\\\n00:22:54 BILAL\\\n. 20,000 means he solves a problem and gets his money back in two years,\nand then he means the battery, after that it has five years, seven years\nbehind it, so\\\n\\\n00:23:04 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. As for the 120 MW, the electricity price became\\\n\\\n00:23:08 BILAL\\\n. Hundreds a month.\\\n\\\n00:23:11 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. No, it depends on his point of view, and the vision of his airport and\nwhat he might operate.

Yes, I remember there was almost a lot of surveys, what? Nine\\\n\\\n00:23:32 BILAL\\\n300,009 What?\\\n\\\n00:23:35 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n300,000 dinars per month, upgrading the electricity and nine\\\n\\\n00:23:40 BILAL\\\nWhat was the size of the farms, do you think?

Mustafa Waleed notes this is 'the biggest problem in Mosul'. This simple mistake reduces battery life from 10 years to just 2-3 years. Hands-on assessment prevents such costly errors.\"\n\n### **Measuring Energy Use (45 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Set up common appliances at the front of the room (refrigerator, fan, phone charger, water pump, etc.)  \n* Have amp meters ready for demonstration  \n* Prepare amperage reference sheet showing typical Mosul appliance loads\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Demonstrate how to use an amp meter safely  \n2. Show how to measure current draw from different appliances  \n3. Record readings on a visible chart, comparing actual readings to typical values  \n4. Discuss variations in energy use and their impact on system sizing  \n5. Have trainees practice measuring and recording amperage\n\n**What to Say:** \"In Mosul, we always calculate system size based on amp-hours, not kilowatt-hours. Why? Because that's how local customers think about their electricity use. They know their refrigerator draws 1.5 amps, not 345 watts. Speaking their language **builds trust**.\n\nLet's measure some common appliances to see their real-world power consumption. This refrigerator is drawing 1.7 amps right now, which is typical for models in Mosul. Write down these measurements—they'll be the foundation for your system designs.\"\n\n**Financial Context:** \"Every amp-hour of energy a solar system produces replaces generator power that costs about 10,000 IQD per month. When you measure a client's refrigerator at 1.7 amps, you can tell them: 'Your refrigerator alone costs you 17,000 IQD monthly on the generator. Solar can eliminate this expense completely.' This concrete financial benefit is more persuasive than technical specifications.\"\n\n## **Session 2: Decode \\+ Decide (11:15-12:45)**\n\n### **Load Calculation Method (40 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Prepare load calculation worksheets in both Arabic and English  \n* Have calculation examples ready on flipchart or slides  \n* Distribute calculators if needed\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Introduce the concept of load calculation using amps  \n2. Walk through step-by-step process using a simple example  \n3. Demonstrate how to account for usage hours  \n4. Show how to calculate total daily amp-hours  \n5. Have trainees complete a worksheet for a typical Mosul home\n\n**What to Say:** \"Now we'll learn how to create a load assessment in amp-hours, which is the foundation of every system design. This simple tool will help you accurately size systems and avoid the two most common mistakes in Mosul: undersizing systems that disappoint customers or oversizing systems that waste their money.\n\nFirst, list all appliances the client wants to power with solar.",

Yes, there are many other\ndetails, the generator, the subject of the generator is annoying, but\nthe only barrier that people face in heading towards the system, is that\nthere is a required amnesty amount from me, an amount, yes, my money,\nyes, a one-time payment, for example, \\$10,000, okay, yes, so the\nsubject is that this barrier is always what stands in their way. Another\nthing is that we, in reality or from the reality that we have made and\nour experience, when we want to convince and be blessed, we always tell\nthem so-and-so, whether he is from their region or from. Who? From their\ncity, for example, when we currently work with, for example, farmers or\ninspectors. It is so-and-so who did this, or succeeded in it, he\nactually succeeded, we do not talk about something in you or something\nthat is actually achieved that something succeeded, yes, good, this\nencourages it a lot, right? Yes? I mean, it exists in some areas, and\nso-and-so did, why shouldn't I do it, so this becomes a very high\nmotivation, we see it, maybe I personally see it, no, why did so-and-so\ndo it, if I do it, it might be that so-and-so's budget is different from\nmine, or that I do not need so-and-so to do this thing, so if I do it, I\nsee that I need it, if I go and do it, but they don't, I mean some of\nthem sometimes, no, it works in Iraq, it works a lot. Ok, we saw it from\nmore than one side, I mean\\\n\\\n00:37:54 SPK_1\\\nYes, it\\'s good, so we need a case, I mean, close to them, thank God,\nMosul has a lot of materials, I mean, what are the prices these days for\nmaterials, and with companies that I\\'m present in Iraq? And if so, we\nwant to see, I mean?\\\n\\\n00:38:17 SPK_2\\\nIt changes, but from what I remember, the 520 was priced at around\n\\$200, okay, depending on its size, but around \\$500 to \\$700.

Distribute case study packets for \"Your cousin's 150m² house\"  \n3. Explain the audit process and deliverables  \n4. Have teams complete a thorough load assessment  \n5. Circulate to provide guidance and answer questions\n\n**What to Say:** \"Now you'll apply what you've learned by conducting a full energy audit for your 'cousin's house.' This 150m² home in East Mosul has a typical family of six with the usual appliances. You'll create a complete load profile, just as you would for a real client.\n\nInterview your teammates as if they were the homeowners. Ask detailed questions: 'How many hours do you run the refrigerator? Do you use the washing machine daily or weekly? What time of day do you need air conditioning?' The more specific your questions, the more accurate your assessment will be.\"\n\n**Stories to Share:** \"One trainee from last year used this exact exercise to design a system for his actual cousin's house the week after training. Because he had practiced the conversation during training, he knew exactly what questions to ask. He uncovered that his cousin was planning to buy a new air conditioner the following month—which would have made his initial system design completely inadequate. This discovery saved him from an embarrassing failure.\"\n\n### **System Size Estimation (30 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Prepare system sizing worksheets  \n* Have component price lists from local suppliers  \n* Create comparison charts for different system configurations\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Guide teams through converting their load assessment to a system design  \n2. Have them determine panel count, battery capacity, and inverter size  \n3. Ask them to create a component list with local prices  \n4. Calculate total system cost and generate an estimated quote  \n5. Determine payback period compared to generator use\n\n**What to Say:** \"Based on your load assessment, you'll now design an appropriate system. Remember Dr. Nasih's advice to focus on homes around 150m² for your first designs. These smaller residential systems are perfect starting points before tackling more complex commercial projects.\n\nFor a typical Mosul home, we recommend a battery bank that can cover at least 12 hours of essential loads. Why? Because grid outages commonly last 8-12 hours, and generator service is usually limited to evening hours. Your system should bridge these gaps reliably.\"\n\n**Financial Context:** \"When calculating payback period, remember that most Mosul households spend between 100,000-200,000 IQD monthly on generator service. A properly sized solar system typically costs 10-15 million IQD but eliminates most of this recurring expense. This means a payback period of 4-6 years for residential systems, after which the client enjoys essentially free electricity for years.\"",

What do you pay for electricity?\nYes, yes? He told me I only pay for the generator per month. Yes, \\$700\nfor kerosene, and even my generator runs. I don\\'t know, for the\ncountry, or about two and a half times more\\\n\\\n00:50:54 BILAL\\\nThis silence means for washing and I don\\'t know what else?\\\n\\\n00:51:00 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n.

We want to install,\nwe\\'ll think about solving a problem. And we need to know the needs, of\nthe house and the location, of the house, etc. I mean. Yes, yes, we\ndecrease or increase, and we are inspired by the material\\'s\nsuitability. So this thing\\\n\\\n00:46:05 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Needs. Keep the same place as the customer, custom. What would be\ncomfortable? Yes? Look, on this basis, he comfortably does the\ncalculations and determines the minimum-maximum\\\n\\\n00:46:25 BILAL.\\\nI expect this is nice and important. But the difficult thing is that\nsomeone will be able to know, yes, the financial needs, the money for my\nhouse, whether this person can pay it, whether he can\\'t pay it, and how\nto deal with it from this point of view, because\\\n\\\n00:46:41 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. The idea is that he will check, he will measure his ability based on\nwhat he can pull. The supplier is considered the main evil more than the\nnational one that exists. It depends on four amperes, six meters,\nbecause it has this one. This is the minimum that you want to operate\\\n\\\n00:47:02 BILAL\\\n. A generator takes the power, how much does it pay for the generator\nand its amperages, and you say this is your baseline, and then we dream\nand say if we were able to open, I mean, two asphalt roads and I don\\'t\nknow what, what would we do and what would it cost, and where would we\nget to? We do it at the minimum, I mean, N.N. If we replace the\ngenerators, what would you pay for the generators monthly? Let\\'s see\nthis, I mean, how much would you get back from us, but that\\'s a\nminimum\\\n\\\n00:47:27 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Exactly. So what would you pay for a sports card from your mother, for\nexample? Would it cost you this much? You\\'ve calculated that in the\nfuture, with the generators that are there. Have you calculated that,\nfor example, in the future, with electricity, the price of the\ngenerators will double and increase? This is a reality, it\\'s not the\ncase now, the National Electricity Company. Electricity from nuclear\nelectricity. We didn\\'t calculate it on the computer now. After six\nyears\\\n\\\n00:48:08 BILAL\\\nThere is a possibility that if we see it change, it changes day by day,\nyes, and the price of oil changes, the price of the national changes,\nyes, and hahaha the amount of sun increases in the best thing hahaha\\\n\\\n00:48:22 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. It is that when he comes to know that he must tell someone that within\nseven years you have returned the price of the entire system, the\nbattery is years old. It is only. It returns the price of the grocery\nstore cow. For example, in the case of this envious person, it has\nbecome \\$500. We are approximately \\$1,000,000. He calculates it in a\nmonth, does the national pay for a generator of 150,000\\\n\\\n00:48:49 BILAL\\\nOkay, the idea, the, the, the workshop, that he has people?\\\n\\\n00:48:54 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\nI mean?\\\n\\\n00:48:56 BILAL\\\n.",

I read, I mean, there was an article that economically, let\\'s say,\nit\\'s considered for homes, I mean, when you come to sell my home with\nsolar, its price will be higher than a normal home, I mean, this is\nsomething, how is this an addition to the home, I mean, it will add to\nits price, this is the point of its longevity. Yes, there are many other\ndetails, the generator, the subject of the generator is annoying, but\nthe only barrier that people face in heading towards the system, is that\nthere is a required amnesty amount from me, an amount, yes, my money,\nyes, a one-time payment, for example, \\$10,000, okay, yes, so the\nsubject is that this barrier is always what stands in their way. Another\nthing is that we, in reality or from the reality that we have made and\nour experience, when we want to convince and be blessed, we always tell\nthem so-and-so, whether he is from their region or from. Who? From their\ncity, for example, when we currently work with, for example, farmers or\ninspectors. It is so-and-so who did this, or succeeded in it, he\nactually succeeded, we do not talk about something in you or something\nthat is actually achieved that something succeeded, yes, good, this\nencourages it a lot, right? Yes? I mean, it exists in some areas, and\nso-and-so did, why shouldn't I do it, so this becomes a very high\nmotivation, we see it, maybe I personally see it, no, why did so-and-so\ndo it, if I do it, it might be that so-and-so's budget is different from\nmine, or that I do not need so-and-so to do this thing, so if I do it, I\nsee that I need it, if I go and do it, but they don't, I mean some of\nthem sometimes, no, it works in Iraq, it works a lot. Ok, we saw it from\nmore than one side, I mean\\\n\\\n00:37:54 SPK_1\\\nYes, it\\'s good, so we need a case, I mean, close to them, thank God,\nMosul has a lot of materials, I mean, what are the prices these days for\nmaterials, and with companies that I\\'m present in Iraq? And if so, we\nwant to see, I mean?\\\n\\\n00:38:17 SPK_2\\\nIt changes, but from what I remember, the 520 was priced at around\n\\$200, okay, depending on its size, but around \\$500 to \\$700.

Quality inverters have robust power handling components that survive Mosul's harsh conditions—grid fluctuations, high temperatures, and dusty environments.\"\n\n**Mosul-specific Mistake Example:** \"A common mistake in Mosul is selecting inverters based solely on power rating and price, ignoring quality indicators. One installation company bought 15 inverters at an attractive price, only to have 11 fail within six months. The thin internal wiring couldn't handle Mosul's summer heat. Remember: in our climate, component quality isn't a luxury—it's a necessity.\"\n\n### **Battery Inspection Exercise (10 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Display different battery types (lead-acid, AGM, lithium)  \n* Have damaged battery samples if safe to display  \n* Prepare temperature measurement demonstration  \n* Create battery placement scenario cards\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Introduce different battery types and their characteristics  \n2. Demonstrate proper battery inspection techniques  \n3. Show temperature effects using IR thermometer  \n4. Highlight ventilation and placement requirements  \n5. Discuss battery failure modes and warning signs\n\n**What to Say:** \"Batteries are the most vulnerable and expensive components in most systems. Mustafa Waleed identifies battery location as 'the biggest problem in Mosul' because batteries placed in hot rooms fail prematurely.\n\nWhen inspecting batteries, check these key points: terminal condition, case integrity, ventilation space, and operating temperature. This infrared thermometer shows this battery is operating at 37°C, which is already reducing its lifespan. In a poorly ventilated room in Mosul's summer, temperatures can exceed 50°C, cutting battery life by 75% or more.\"\n\n**Financial Context:** \"A quality 200Ah lithium battery costs approximately 1.5-2 million IQD. When properly installed in a cool, ventilated space, it should last 8-10 years. The same battery in a hot, unventilated location might last only 2-3 years. This simple placement mistake costs the client 4-5 million IQD in premature replacements over a 10-year period.\"\n\n## **Session 2: Decode \\+ Decide (11:15-12:45)**\n\n### **Datasheet Scavenger Hunt (40 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Prepare component datasheets in both Arabic and English  \n* Create scavenger hunt worksheets with specific data points to find  \n* Have manufacturer websites or catalogs available for reference  \n* Prepare datasheet comparison slides highlighting key specifications\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Explain the importance of datasheet literacy  \n2. Distribute datasheets and scavenger hunt worksheets  \n3.",

We want to install,\nwe\\'ll think about solving a problem. And we need to know the needs, of\nthe house and the location, of the house, etc. I mean. Yes, yes, we\ndecrease or increase, and we are inspired by the material\\'s\nsuitability. So this thing\\\n\\\n00:46:05 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Needs. Keep the same place as the customer, custom. What would be\ncomfortable? Yes? Look, on this basis, he comfortably does the\ncalculations and determines the minimum-maximum\\\n\\\n00:46:25 BILAL.\\\nI expect this is nice and important. But the difficult thing is that\nsomeone will be able to know, yes, the financial needs, the money for my\nhouse, whether this person can pay it, whether he can\\'t pay it, and how\nto deal with it from this point of view, because\\\n\\\n00:46:41 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. The idea is that he will check, he will measure his ability based on\nwhat he can pull. The supplier is considered the main evil more than the\nnational one that exists. It depends on four amperes, six meters,\nbecause it has this one. This is the minimum that you want to operate\\\n\\\n00:47:02 BILAL\\\n. A generator takes the power, how much does it pay for the generator\nand its amperages, and you say this is your baseline, and then we dream\nand say if we were able to open, I mean, two asphalt roads and I don\\'t\nknow what, what would we do and what would it cost, and where would we\nget to? We do it at the minimum, I mean, N.N. If we replace the\ngenerators, what would you pay for the generators monthly? Let\\'s see\nthis, I mean, how much would you get back from us, but that\\'s a\nminimum\\\n\\\n00:47:27 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Exactly. So what would you pay for a sports card from your mother, for\nexample? Would it cost you this much? You\\'ve calculated that in the\nfuture, with the generators that are there. Have you calculated that,\nfor example, in the future, with electricity, the price of the\ngenerators will double and increase? This is a reality, it\\'s not the\ncase now, the National Electricity Company. Electricity from nuclear\nelectricity. We didn\\'t calculate it on the computer now. After six\nyears\\\n\\\n00:48:08 BILAL\\\nThere is a possibility that if we see it change, it changes day by day,\nyes, and the price of oil changes, the price of the national changes,\nyes, and hahaha the amount of sun increases in the best thing hahaha\\\n\\\n00:48:22 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. It is that when he comes to know that he must tell someone that within\nseven years you have returned the price of the entire system, the\nbattery is years old. It is only. It returns the price of the grocery\nstore cow. For example, in the case of this envious person, it has\nbecome \\$500. We are approximately \\$1,000,000. He calculates it in a\nmonth, does the national pay for a generator of 150,000\\\n\\\n00:48:49 BILAL\\\nOkay, the idea, the, the, the workshop, that he has people?\\\n\\\n00:48:54 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\nI mean?\\\n\\\n00:48:56 BILAL\\\n.",

Mosul gets ~5 kWh/m²/day.\nkWh-Amp conversion - Amps × Volts × Hours ÷ 1000 = kWh\n\nSnap a photo - you'll need these all week.\"\n```\n\n### Slide 20: Datasheet Quick-Read\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Grab the datasheets on your table - one Longi, one cheap panel.\nYou have 2 minutes to find three specs:\n- Voc (open circuit voltage)\n- Isc (short circuit current)  \n- Temp coefficient\n\nThink of Voc as water pressure with nozzle closed.\nIsc is full flow with nozzle removed.\nTemp-coef is how flow drops when hose heats up.\n\nTimer starts... NOW!\"\n```\n\n**Actions:** Walk around, help stuck teams, announce answers after 2 min\n\n### Slide 21: Component Stations - Setup\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Check your station has everything on this list. If anything's missing, \nraise your hand once. Otherwise, get familiar with your tools - \nwe start rotations in 5 minutes.\"\n```\n\n## 10:45 - Hands-On Stations\n\n### Slide 22: Component Stations Rotation\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE (5 min briefing):**\n```\n\"Four stations, 15 minutes each. When you hear the whistle, rotate clockwise.\n\nSTATION 1 - Panel ISC Test: \nConnect tester, press ISC button, record in Ahmed's worksheet.\n\nSTATION 2 - Inverter Teardown:\nLift both lids, spot 3 differences - heatsink, fuse, copper width.\n\nSTATION 3 - Battery Temp-Log:\nIR gun three spots, record highest temp. Note if over 35°C.\n\nSTATION 4 - MC4 Crimp:\nStrip 8mm, crimp connector, test polarity with multimeter.\n\nSafety rules:\n- PPE always on\n- Keep tools tidy\n- Rotate immediately on whistle\n\nYour goal: One measurement per station into Workbook Tab 1.\nReady? First whistle in 30 seconds...\"\n```\n\n**Station Management:**\n- Set 15-minute timer\n- Blow whistle for rotations\n- Check each station's progress\n- Help struggling teams\n\n## 12:00 - LUNCH\n*60-minute break*\n\n## 13:00 - SELL Block\n\n### Slide 23: LUNCH Header\n*Return from lunch slide*\n\n### Slide 24: Mini-Debrief - Linking Theory to Practice\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE:**\n```\n\"Welcome back! Let's connect morning theory to your measurements.\n\nOne volunteer from each station - come write ONE number you measured.\n[As they write]: See how your 38V Voc links to our yellow compatibility branch?\nReal measurements prove our theory!\n\n60 seconds - go!\"\n```\n\n### Slide 25: Load Calculation Workshop\n\n**SPEAKER NOTE (4 min intro + 20 min activity):**\n```\n\"Now we become Ahmed's engineers. Open Tab 1 - Load & Baseline ROI.\n\nStep 1: Measure the demo kettle with our plug meter\nStep 2: Enter current, hours, voltage  \nStep 3: Add your local tariffs\nStep 4: Watch auto-calculations\nStep 5: Set three financial goals:\n  - Target payback years\n  - Monthly savings target\n  - Generator reduction %\n\nI'll circulate to help.

                "text": "Good ideas for a BEIT Solar Energy Facilitation Guide Deliverable 1 Draft.md\nYesterday we mastered physical installation; today we'll learn to design complete systems and build successful businesses around them. As Muayad Hasan emphasizes, simulation software like PVsyst helps create accurate system designs.\n\nProfessional system design software allows you to:\n\n* Model system performance with precision  \n* Account for local climate conditions  \n* Compare different configuration options  \n* Generate professional reports for customers  \n* Validate your manual calculations\n\nFor Mosul installations, we need to adjust standard parameters to reflect local conditions—higher temperatures, dust accumulation, and grid instability. These adjustments ensure realistic performance projections that won't disappoint customers.\"\n\n**Mosul-specific Mistake Example:** \"A designer used default software settings without adjusting for Mosul conditions. His projections showed 15% higher output than the system could actually deliver. The customer was dissatisfied when the system underperformed, damaging the installer's reputation. Always adjust simulation parameters to reflect Mosul's higher temperatures, dust conditions, and other local factors.\"\n\n### **ROI Calculator Exploration (40 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Prepare ROI calculator spreadsheets  \n* Load current component pricing for Mosul  \n* Create comparison scenarios for different system types  \n* Have generator cost data available\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n* Introduce financial modeling concepts  \n* Demonstrate ROI calculator features:  \n  * System cost computation  \n  * Energy production valuation  \n  * Payback period calculation  \n  * Comparison with generator costs  \n  * Residential vs. commercial differences  \n* Show how to customize calculations for specific customers  \n* Guide trainees through calculator operation\n\n**What to Say:** \"Financial calculations transform technical designs into compelling value propositions. As Ali Abkan says, 'We must run the numbers so people see why the expensive one is actually cheaper.'\n\nOur ROI calculator accounts for Mosul's specific economic factors:\n\n* Current generator fuel costs (approximately 10,000-12,000 IQD per ampere monthly)  \n* Varying electricity rates and availability  \n* Maintenance and replacement costs  \n* System degradation over time  \n* Different payback periods for residential and commercial applications\n\nAs Mustafa Waleed points out, 'Commercial systems payback in 2 years, residential in 6-8 years.' Understanding these differences helps you target the right customers with appropriate solutions.\"\n\n**Financial Context:** \"When comparing solar to generator power, include all costs. A typical 10-ampere generator service costs approximately 120,000 IQD monthly in fuel alone, plus maintenance and eventual replacement. Over 10 years, this exceeds 15 million IQD—far more than an equivalent solar system. The calculator makes this comparison clear and compelling for customers.\"",

It is only. It returns the price of the grocery\nstore cow. For example, in the case of this envious person, it has\nbecome \\$500. We are approximately \\$1,000,000. He calculates it in a\nmonth, does the national pay for a generator of 150,000\\\n\\\n00:48:49 BILAL\\\nOkay, the idea, the, the, the workshop, that he has people?\\\n\\\n00:48:54 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\nI mean?\\\n\\\n00:48:56 BILAL\\\n. He knows a lot about electricity, and he means engineering teachers,\nand we want to find them job opportunities. This is the\\\n\\\n00:49:05 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. This means that a thousand brothers will come out and come back within\na year, to come out for the battery. In the future, this means that the\nprice will continue to rise more and more\\\n\\\n00:49:16 BILAL\\\nAnd this is in the the that we\\'re talking about now, isn\\'t it someone\nwho installs it? Isn\\'t it someone who understands electronics, which is\nunderstanding the customer, understanding the system, and how can\nsomeone find this? We will definitely do some practical work. They need\nto know how to install it, so that when they go, they can supervise the\nproject. All of this is just the basic pillar that we work on. And what\ndo I mean by this? I see this as important. How do you talk to the\ncustomer? What do you expect people to need? How does one start, where\ndo they go, where do they go?\\\n\\\n00:50:04 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Look, your first job in politics, so that you sell someone a certain\nthing? You need this person to have a problem that needs a solution,\nright? So that you give him a portfolio to carry this thing.\\\n\\\n00:50:16 BILAL\\\nRight. Right?\\\n\\\n00:50:17 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\nIf he doesn\\'t have this problem, you won\\'t convince him, right?\nAbsolutely, right or not?\\\n\\\n00:50:23 BILAL\\\n. No, right, right, right, yes\\\n\\\n00:50:25 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Okay, but it happened to someone that he was a part of us, no, come\nwash with the cars. Take more sorrows. What do you pay for electricity?\nYes, yes? He told me I only pay for the generator per month. Yes, \\$700\nfor kerosene, and even my generator runs. I don\\'t know, for the\ncountry, or about two and a half times more\\\n\\\n00:50:54 BILAL\\\nThis silence means for washing and I don\\'t know what else?\\\n\\\n00:51:00 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. It was only \\$1,500 per month. Electricity, yes, okay? God willing,\nyou have enough space. I feel like it should be from a solar energy\nsystem, I mean, you just look for it during the day\\\n\\\n00:51:16 BILAL\\\n. That\\'s right. Honestly, you don\\'t need a battery from agriculture,\napproximately\\\n\\\n00:51:22 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Almost, but what? Industrial? And they need a large battery to heat\nthe electricity, so this battery is enough\\\n\\\n00:51:33 BILAL\\\nto keep it okay?\\\n\\\n00:51:35 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n.

The idea is that he will check, he will measure his ability based on\nwhat he can pull. The supplier is considered the main evil more than the\nnational one that exists.

We do it at the minimum, I mean, N.N. If we replace the\ngenerators, what would you pay for the generators monthly? Let\\'s see\nthis, I mean, how much would you get back from us, but that\\'s a\nminimum\\\n\\\n00:47:27 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Exactly. So what would you pay for a sports card from your mother, for\nexample? Would it cost you this much? You\\'ve calculated that in the\nfuture, with the generators that are there. Have you calculated that,\nfor example, in the future, with electricity, the price of the\ngenerators will double and increase?

Let me show you how to keep that money\"\n\n**Props**: \n- Their actual generator bill\n- Calculator showing monthly savings\n- Photo of similar successful installation\n\n### Pain Acknowledgment (1 minute)\n**Key Points to Address:**\n1. \"Generator noise disrupting customers/family\"\n2. \"Fuel price uncertainty\"\n3. \"Maintenance headaches\"\n4. \"Power cuts during peak business\"\n\n**Magic Words**: \"You're not alone - every business in Mosul faces this\"\n\n### Solution Presentation (2 minutes)\n\n**The Amp-Based Explanation:**\n\"Your business uses [X] amps. At 50,000 IQD per amp, that's [Y] IQD monthly.\nA solar system provides those same [X] amps for free after installation.\"\n\n**Visual Aid**: Simple diagram showing:\n```\nGenerator: Fuel → Noise → Power → Monthly Bill\nSolar: Sunlight → Silence → Power → No Bill\n```\n\n### Investment Clarity (1 minute)\n\n**The Three Numbers That Matter:**\n1. System Cost: _______ IQD (one-time)\n2. Monthly Savings: _______ IQD (forever)\n3. Payback: _______ months (then pure profit)\n\n**Comparison They Understand:**\n\"Like buying a car instead of taking taxi every day\"\n\n### Close with Next Step (30 seconds)\n\n**Soft Close Options:**\n1. \"Should we check if your roof is suitable?\"\n2. \"Would you like to see a similar system working?\"\n3. \"Can I calculate exact savings for your business?\"\n\n## Common Customer Objections & Responses\n\n### \"It's too expensive\"\n**Response**: \"Expensive compared to what? You'll spend [10-year generator cost] on generator fuel. Solar costs [system cost] once.\"\n**Proof**: Show 10-year calculation spreadsheet\n\n### \"Does it work in dust storms?\"\n**Response**: \"Yes, with reduced output. But generator doesn't work without fuel. Solar works even at 50% on worst days.\"\n**Evidence**: Show production data from dusty days\n\n### \"What about maintenance?\"\n**Response**: \"Monthly cleaning, annual check. Compare to generator: daily fuel, monthly oil, yearly overhaul.\"\n**Demonstration**: Show cleaning video (2 minutes)\n\n### \"I don't trust new technology\"\n**Response**: \"Baghdad has used solar since 1979. This panel has 25-year warranty. How long does generator last?\"\n**Local Proof**: Show nearby installations\n\n### \"Will it power AC units?\"\n**Response**: \"Yes, we size specifically for your AC load.",

                "text": "Good ideas for a BEIT Solar Energy Facilitation Guide Deliverable 1 Draft.md\nDivide trainees into teams of 3-4  \n2. Distribute case study packets for \"Your cousin's 150m² house\"  \n3. Explain the audit process and deliverables  \n4. Have teams complete a thorough load assessment  \n5. Circulate to provide guidance and answer questions\n\n**What to Say:** \"Now you'll apply what you've learned by conducting a full energy audit for your 'cousin's house.' This 150m² home in East Mosul has a typical family of six with the usual appliances. You'll create a complete load profile, just as you would for a real client.\n\nInterview your teammates as if they were the homeowners. Ask detailed questions: 'How many hours do you run the refrigerator? Do you use the washing machine daily or weekly? What time of day do you need air conditioning?' The more specific your questions, the more accurate your assessment will be.\"\n\n**Stories to Share:** \"One trainee from last year used this exact exercise to design a system for his actual cousin's house the week after training. Because he had practiced the conversation during training, he knew exactly what questions to ask. He uncovered that his cousin was planning to buy a new air conditioner the following month—which would have made his initial system design completely inadequate. This discovery saved him from an embarrassing failure.\"\n\n### **System Size Estimation (30 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Prepare system sizing worksheets  \n* Have component price lists from local suppliers  \n* Create comparison charts for different system configurations\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Guide teams through converting their load assessment to a system design  \n2. Have them determine panel count, battery capacity, and inverter size  \n3. Ask them to create a component list with local prices  \n4. Calculate total system cost and generate an estimated quote  \n5. Determine payback period compared to generator use\n\n**What to Say:** \"Based on your load assessment, you'll now design an appropriate system. Remember Dr. Nasih's advice to focus on homes around 150m² for your first designs. These smaller residential systems are perfect starting points before tackling more complex commercial projects.\n\nFor a typical Mosul home, we recommend a battery bank that can cover at least 12 hours of essential loads. Why? Because grid outages commonly last 8-12 hours, and generator service is usually limited to evening hours. Your system should bridge these gaps reliably.\"\n\n**Financial Context:** \"When calculating payback period, remember that most Mosul households spend between 100,000-200,000 IQD monthly on generator service. A properly sized solar system typically costs 10-15 million IQD but eliminates most of this recurring expense. This means a payback period of 4-6 years for residential systems, after which the client enjoys essentially free electricity for years.\"",

What do you pay for electricity?\nYes, yes? He told me I only pay for the generator per month. Yes, \\$700\nfor kerosene, and even my generator runs. I don\\'t know, for the\ncountry, or about two and a half times more\\\n\\\n00:50:54 BILAL\\\nThis silence means for washing and I don\\'t know what else?\\\n\\\n00:51:00 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n.

We want to install,\nwe\\'ll think about solving a problem. And we need to know the needs, of\nthe house and the location, of the house, etc. I mean. Yes, yes, we\ndecrease or increase, and we are inspired by the material\\'s\nsuitability. So this thing\\\n\\\n00:46:05 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Needs. Keep the same place as the customer, custom. What would be\ncomfortable? Yes? Look, on this basis, he comfortably does the\ncalculations and determines the minimum-maximum\\\n\\\n00:46:25 BILAL.\\\nI expect this is nice and important. But the difficult thing is that\nsomeone will be able to know, yes, the financial needs, the money for my\nhouse, whether this person can pay it, whether he can\\'t pay it, and how\nto deal with it from this point of view, because\\\n\\\n00:46:41 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. The idea is that he will check, he will measure his ability based on\nwhat he can pull. The supplier is considered the main evil more than the\nnational one that exists. It depends on four amperes, six meters,\nbecause it has this one. This is the minimum that you want to operate\\\n\\\n00:47:02 BILAL\\\n. A generator takes the power, how much does it pay for the generator\nand its amperages, and you say this is your baseline, and then we dream\nand say if we were able to open, I mean, two asphalt roads and I don\\'t\nknow what, what would we do and what would it cost, and where would we\nget to? We do it at the minimum, I mean, N.N. If we replace the\ngenerators, what would you pay for the generators monthly? Let\\'s see\nthis, I mean, how much would you get back from us, but that\\'s a\nminimum\\\n\\\n00:47:27 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. Exactly. So what would you pay for a sports card from your mother, for\nexample? Would it cost you this much? You\\'ve calculated that in the\nfuture, with the generators that are there. Have you calculated that,\nfor example, in the future, with electricity, the price of the\ngenerators will double and increase? This is a reality, it\\'s not the\ncase now, the National Electricity Company. Electricity from nuclear\nelectricity. We didn\\'t calculate it on the computer now. After six\nyears\\\n\\\n00:48:08 BILAL\\\nThere is a possibility that if we see it change, it changes day by day,\nyes, and the price of oil changes, the price of the national changes,\nyes, and hahaha the amount of sun increases in the best thing hahaha\\\n\\\n00:48:22 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\n. It is that when he comes to know that he must tell someone that within\nseven years you have returned the price of the entire system, the\nbattery is years old. It is only. It returns the price of the grocery\nstore cow. For example, in the case of this envious person, it has\nbecome \\$500. We are approximately \\$1,000,000. He calculates it in a\nmonth, does the national pay for a generator of 150,000\\\n\\\n00:48:49 BILAL\\\nOkay, the idea, the, the, the workshop, that he has people?\\\n\\\n00:48:54 MUSTAFA WALEED\\\nI mean?\\\n\\\n00:48:56 BILAL\\\n.",

Or when you want to convince them to go to Solar, is\nit for them to leave?\\\n\\\n00:35:45 SPK_2\\\n. I read, I mean, there was an article that economically, let\\'s say,\nit\\'s considered for homes, I mean, when you come to sell my home with\nsolar, its price will be higher than a normal home, I mean, this is\nsomething, how is this an addition to the home, I mean, it will add to\nits price, this is the point of its longevity. Yes, there are many other\ndetails, the generator, the subject of the generator is annoying, but\nthe only barrier that people face in heading towards the system, is that\nthere is a required amnesty amount from me, an amount, yes, my money,\nyes, a one-time payment, for example, \\$10,000, okay, yes, so the\nsubject is that this barrier is always what stands in their way. Another\nthing is that we, in reality or from the reality that we have made and\nour experience, when we want to convince and be blessed, we always tell\nthem so-and-so, whether he is from their region or from. Who? From their\ncity, for example, when we currently work with, for example, farmers or\ninspectors. It is so-and-so who did this, or succeeded in it, he\nactually succeeded, we do not talk about something in you or something\nthat is actually achieved that something succeeded, yes, good, this\nencourages it a lot, right? Yes? I mean, it exists in some areas, and\nso-and-so did, why shouldn't I do it, so this becomes a very high\nmotivation, we see it, maybe I personally see it, no, why did so-and-so\ndo it, if I do it, it might be that so-and-so's budget is different from\nmine, or that I do not need so-and-so to do this thing, so if I do it, I\nsee that I need it, if I go and do it, but they don't, I mean some of\nthem sometimes, no, it works in Iraq, it works a lot. Ok, we saw it from\nmore than one side, I mean\\\n\\\n00:37:54 SPK_1\\\nYes, it\\'s good, so we need a case, I mean, close to them, thank God,\nMosul has a lot of materials, I mean, what are the prices these days for\nmaterials, and with companies that I\\'m present in Iraq? And if so, we\nwant to see, I mean?\\\n\\\n00:38:17 SPK_2\\\nIt changes, but from what I remember, the 520 was priced at around\n\\$200, okay, depending on its size, but around \\$500 to \\$700. Lithium\nbatteries. Ethiom ion batteries last approximately, yes. They last\napproximately ten years. Ben Benrah 15. Yes, sorry, between \\$1,500 and\n\\$2,000. That\\'s something for a single battery, but there will be\nflexibility, yes, there was a very dominant company, a Chinese company,\nI don\\'t remember its name?\\\n\\\n00:39:22 SPK_1\\\n. Yes, and now these prices are from\\\n\\\n00:39:24 SPK_2\\\n. This company in this format, I don\\'t remember the name well? This is\neverything. But it differs, I mean, according to.

Financial\ncalculations? What kind of program as a whole is there something good?\\\n\\\n00:32:27 SPK_1\\\n. Good, so we handed over the test battery. Then we said installation,\nmeaning the complete installation. We start from the morning to the\nhoneymoon, explaining to them how to bring the panels and how to install\nthem, and let\\'s say what do you do? Calculating the entire system, for\nthe solar energy system, for example, you know we went down to the\ncommunity level, ready, no, no, calculating the amperes that the\ncustomer wants, and the cost, I mean, who does it? What color? I\\'ll\ntell you, and you formula yes, our community is new, a large part. And\nmy west is this basic community F. Whoever comes and brings you, I want\n10 during the day, 5:00 at night. How do you calculate that as an\nengineer? I want 20 from the rack. One day, an engineer contacted me,\nGod willing, he wants 50 amperes during the day, the language and the\nhouse is his father, and 20 at night, so he doesn\\'t supply a battery\nfor panels, he wants 50 during the day from 20 at night. As an engineer,\nhe must have received training to know how many panels and how many one,\nyou know, for example, during the day there are panels. And when you\nhave electricity, for example, the national one is running, so you take\na unit from him, isn\\'t there one? I don\\'t know, by God I just don\\'t\nknow, there are no panels, so you calculate the time you need during the\nday with the watts you need at night, and you do a bunch of\ncalculations, almost a whole sheet, I mean any combinations of volts\nuntil you get a final result, you tell him, for example, you need an 8kV\ninverter, a 10kV battery, 16 M panels, MC4, the connection, etc. And the\nelectrician takes that much, etc. And the blacksmith installs 30 corners\nfor you, for example, say it comes to \\$3,500, anything would be great,\nso what do I do today\\\n\\\n00:34:08 SPK_2\\\nno no no? Three ways, or four, from cheap to expensive, and each one\ndoes the same model, say ten during the day, 5:00 at night. Okay, let\\'s\ngive it to all of them, that\\'s it. Later, we want to know the prices.",

Like my father says\\\n\\\n00:31:40 SPK_2\\\n. The first day is the. The date and the technical. The second day is\nthe\\\n\\\n00:31:45 SPK_1\\\nspecializes in?\\\n\\\n00:31:46 SPK_2\\\n. The inverters, now, we separated the third day, right? Okay, good. I\nthought I missed the day you advised\\\n\\\n00:31:49 SPK_1\\\n. The batteries. No, no, now history, inverter E, then battery E, third\nday became, yes, fourth day\\\n\\\n00:31:59 SPK_2\\\n. We need at least 34 inverters from the unfortunate one to the\nMercedes\\\n\\\n00:32:06 SPK_1\\\n. And the good one\\\n\\\n00:32:07 SPK_2\\\nEveryone is right and cancel it and tell me why is this good? And this\none is not good?\\\n\\\n00:32:13 SPK_1\\\n. I will not tell you\\\n\\\n00:32:15 SPK_2\\\nyou tell me why?\\\n\\\n00:32:16 SPK_1\\\nwe need this?\\\n\\\n00:32:17 SPK_2\\\nseason, and then maybe what is its impact on yes? Financial\ncalculations? What kind of program as a whole is there something good?\\\n\\\n00:32:27 SPK_1\\\n. Good, so we handed over the test battery. Then we said installation,\nmeaning the complete installation. We start from the morning to the\nhoneymoon, explaining to them how to bring the panels and how to install\nthem, and let\\'s say what do you do? Calculating the entire system, for\nthe solar energy system, for example, you know we went down to the\ncommunity level, ready, no, no, calculating the amperes that the\ncustomer wants, and the cost, I mean, who does it? What color? I\\'ll\ntell you, and you formula yes, our community is new, a large part. And\nmy west is this basic community F. Whoever comes and brings you, I want\n10 during the day, 5:00 at night. How do you calculate that as an\nengineer? I want 20 from the rack. One day, an engineer contacted me,\nGod willing, he wants 50 amperes during the day, the language and the\nhouse is his father, and 20 at night, so he doesn\\'t supply a battery\nfor panels, he wants 50 during the day from 20 at night. As an engineer,\nhe must have received training to know how many panels and how many one,\nyou know, for example, during the day there are panels. And when you\nhave electricity, for example, the national one is running, so you take\na unit from him, isn\\'t there one? I don\\'t know, by God I just don\\'t\nknow, there are no panels, so you calculate the time you need during the\nday with the watts you need at night, and you do a bunch of\ncalculations, almost a whole sheet, I mean any combinations of volts\nuntil you get a final result, you tell him, for example, you need an 8kV\ninverter, a 10kV battery, 16 M panels, MC4, the connection, etc. And the\nelectrician takes that much, etc. And the blacksmith installs 30 corners\nfor you, for example, say it comes to \\$3,500, anything would be great,\nso what do I do today\\\n\\\n00:34:08 SPK_2\\\nno no no? Three ways, or four, from cheap to expensive, and each one\ndoes the same model, say ten during the day, 5:00 at night. Okay, let\\'s\ngive it to all of them, that\\'s it. Later, we want to know the prices.",

Or when you want to convince them to go to Solar, is\nit for them to leave?\\\n\\\n00:35:45 SPK_2\\\n. I read, I mean, there was an article that economically, let\\'s say,\nit\\'s considered for homes, I mean, when you come to sell my home with\nsolar, its price will be higher than a normal home, I mean, this is\nsomething, how is this an addition to the home, I mean, it will add to\nits price, this is the point of its longevity. Yes, there are many other\ndetails, the generator, the subject of the generator is annoying, but\nthe only barrier that people face in heading towards the system, is that\nthere is a required amnesty amount from me, an amount, yes, my money,\nyes, a one-time payment, for example, \\$10,000, okay, yes, so the\nsubject is that this barrier is always what stands in their way. Another\nthing is that we, in reality or from the reality that we have made and\nour experience, when we want to convince and be blessed, we always tell\nthem so-and-so, whether he is from their region or from. Who? From their\ncity, for example, when we currently work with, for example, farmers or\ninspectors. It is so-and-so who did this, or succeeded in it, he\nactually succeeded, we do not talk about something in you or something\nthat is actually achieved that something succeeded, yes, good, this\nencourages it a lot, right? Yes? I mean, it exists in some areas, and\nso-and-so did, why shouldn't I do it, so this becomes a very high\nmotivation, we see it, maybe I personally see it, no, why did so-and-so\ndo it, if I do it, it might be that so-and-so's budget is different from\nmine, or that I do not need so-and-so to do this thing, so if I do it, I\nsee that I need it, if I go and do it, but they don't, I mean some of\nthem sometimes, no, it works in Iraq, it works a lot. Ok, we saw it from\nmore than one side, I mean\\\n\\\n00:37:54 SPK_1\\\nYes, it\\'s good, so we need a case, I mean, close to them, thank God,\nMosul has a lot of materials, I mean, what are the prices these days for\nmaterials, and with companies that I\\'m present in Iraq? And if so, we\nwant to see, I mean?\\\n\\\n00:38:17 SPK_2\\\nIt changes, but from what I remember, the 520 was priced at around\n\\$200, okay, depending on its size, but around \\$500 to \\$700. Lithium\nbatteries. Ethiom ion batteries last approximately, yes. They last\napproximately ten years. Ben Benrah 15. Yes, sorry, between \\$1,500 and\n\\$2,000. That\\'s something for a single battery, but there will be\nflexibility, yes, there was a very dominant company, a Chinese company,\nI don\\'t remember its name?\\\n\\\n00:39:22 SPK_1\\\n. Yes, and now these prices are from\\\n\\\n00:39:24 SPK_2\\\n. This company in this format, I don\\'t remember the name well? This is\neverything. But it differs, I mean, according to.

You came to tell me I want a very good\nsystem, meaning the highest specifications, but the battery is no\nproblem for me, because I will replace the battery every five years, so\nwhat do I see? It\\'s very high, but I don\\'t want to pay the price.\nHere, the customer is the engineer, meaning, for example, I won\\'t be\nable to give him an expensive battery. Yes, I have to choose a battery\nwhose price is compatible with the inverter, which is expensive, for\nexample, right? Right, it\\'s not right to choose a type that isn\\'t\ncompatible with the inverter. Now it has started\\\n\\\n00:18:44 BILAL\\\n. The discussion, and with the customer, Hamina\\\n\\\n00:18:47 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. If you want, of course\\\n\\\n00:18:47 BILAL\\\n. Zina battery\\\n\\\n00:18:50 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Yes. Here\\\n\\\n00:18:53 BILAL\\\nrelationship, and with the customer and what information?\\\n\\\n00:18:58 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. This, this, you don\\'t have it with the customer yet, we are talking.\nAs engineers. These are the answers that must be given. The engineer\nknows them before he proposes anything. Because if he doesn\\'t know\nthem, he will face problems in the design and implementation. And if the\nbattery starts, the customer asks you, why did the battery start? I want\nthis, I chose this, he doesn\\'t know there is a technical problem,\ndon\\'t imagine\\\n\\\n00:19:26 BILAL\\\n. Yes, it\\'s true that it doesn\\'t match, so it must be from the\nbeginning\\\n\\\n00:19:28 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. This compatibility, all of this is necessary for the installer and the\nengineer working in the field\\\n\\\n00:19:34 BILAL\\\n. Right?

Yes, the design of the panels in terms of implementation, in terms of\nthe wind, in terms of the angle of inclination, and in terms of the\nshade. Yes, these are a lot of mistakes that engineers make, a lot. I\nmean, he makes a system in the sky, and any gust of wind after a year or\ntwo will happen or a problem will occur, this is fatal, so we have to\nimprove, I mean\\\n\\\n00:20:15 BILAL\\\n. We\\'re shooting banners, I mean, they gave people\\\n\\\n00:20:18 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. How many of you have it? I mean, with companies? Yes, that\\'s all? No\none publishes about us, because they don\\'t publish because this is what\ncompanies have to say, so they get scared\\\n\\\n00:20:28 BILAL\\\n. But it\\'s important that people focus on it\\\n\\\n00:20:31 MOHAMMED AL-QATAN\\\n. Very important. Praise be to God and thanks.

Then we said installation,\nmeaning the complete installation. We start from the morning to the\nhoneymoon, explaining to them how to bring the panels and how to install\nthem, and let\\'s say what do you do? Calculating the entire system, for\nthe solar energy system, for example, you know we went down to the\ncommunity level, ready, no, no, calculating the amperes that the\ncustomer wants, and the cost, I mean, who does it? What color? I\\'ll\ntell you, and you formula yes, our community is new, a large part. And\nmy west is this basic community F. Whoever comes and brings you, I want\n10 during the day, 5:00 at night. How do you calculate that as an\nengineer? I want 20 from the rack. One day, an engineer contacted me,\nGod willing, he wants 50 amperes during the day, the language and the\nhouse is his father, and 20 at night, so he doesn\\'t supply a battery\nfor panels, he wants 50 during the day from 20 at night. As an engineer,\nhe must have received training to know how many panels and how many one,\nyou know, for example, during the day there are panels. And when you\nhave electricity, for example, the national one is running, so you take\na unit from him, isn\\'t there one? I don\\'t know, by God I just don\\'t\nknow, there are no panels, so you calculate the time you need during the\nday with the watts you need at night, and you do a bunch of\ncalculations, almost a whole sheet, I mean any combinations of volts\nuntil you get a final result, you tell him, for example, you need an 8kV\ninverter, a 10kV battery, 16 M panels, MC4, the connection, etc. And the\nelectrician takes that much, etc. And the blacksmith installs 30 corners\nfor you, for example, say it comes to \\$3,500, anything would be great,\nso what do I do today\\\n\\\n00:34:08 SPK_2\\\nno no no? Three ways, or four, from cheap to expensive, and each one\ndoes the same model, say ten during the day, 5:00 at night. Okay, let\\'s\ngive it to all of them, that\\'s it.

I will not tell you\\\n\\\n00:32:15 SPK_2\\\nyou tell me why?\\\n\\\n00:32:16 SPK_1\\\nwe need this?\\\n\\\n00:32:17 SPK_2\\\nseason, and then maybe what is its impact on yes? Financial\ncalculations? What kind of program as a whole is there something good?\\\n\\\n00:32:27 SPK_1\\\n. Good, so we handed over the test battery. Then we said installation,\nmeaning the complete installation. We start from the morning to the\nhoneymoon, explaining to them how to bring the panels and how to install\nthem, and let\\'s say what do you do? Calculating the entire system, for\nthe solar energy system, for example, you know we went down to the\ncommunity level, ready, no, no, calculating the amperes that the\ncustomer wants, and the cost, I mean, who does it? What color? I\\'ll\ntell you, and you formula yes, our community is new, a large part. And\nmy west is this basic community F. Whoever comes and brings you, I want\n10 during the day, 5:00 at night. How do you calculate that as an\nengineer? I want 20 from the rack. One day, an engineer contacted me,\nGod willing, he wants 50 amperes during the day, the language and the\nhouse is his father, and 20 at night, so he doesn\\'t supply a battery\nfor panels, he wants 50 during the day from 20 at night. As an engineer,\nhe must have received training to know how many panels and how many one,\nyou know, for example, during the day there are panels. And when you\nhave electricity, for example, the national one is running, so you take\na unit from him, isn\\'t there one? I don\\'t know, by God I just don\\'t\nknow, there are no panels, so you calculate the time you need during the\nday with the watts you need at night, and you do a bunch of\ncalculations, almost a whole sheet, I mean any combinations of volts\nuntil you get a final result, you tell him, for example, you need an 8kV\ninverter, a 10kV battery, 16 M panels, MC4, the connection, etc. And the\nelectrician takes that much, etc. And the blacksmith installs 30 corners\nfor you, for example, say it comes to \\$3,500, anything would be great,\nso what do I do today\\\n\\\n00:34:08 SPK_2\\\nno no no? Three ways, or four, from cheap to expensive, and each one\ndoes the same model, say ten during the day, 5:00 at night. Okay, let\\'s\ngive it to all of them, that\\'s it. Later, we want to know the prices.",

                "text": "Good ideas for a BEIT Solar Energy Facilitation Guide Deliverable 1 Draft.md\nWhy? Because grid outages commonly last 8-12 hours, and generator service is usually limited to evening hours. Your system should bridge these gaps reliably.\"\n\n**Financial Context:** \"When calculating payback period, remember that most Mosul households spend between 100,000-200,000 IQD monthly on generator service. A properly sized solar system typically costs 10-15 million IQD but eliminates most of this recurring expense. This means a payback period of 4-6 years for residential systems, after which the client enjoys essentially free electricity for years.\"\n\n### **Client Communication Role-Play (20 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Prepare common client questions and objections cards  \n* Create a simple role-play scenario script  \n* Have visual aids ready to demonstrate system benefits\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Demonstrate effective client communication with a volunteer  \n2. Show how to explain technical concepts in simple terms  \n3. Model handling common objections about cost, reliability, etc.  \n4. Have trainees pair up for role-play practice  \n5. Provide feedback on communication effectiveness\n\n**What to Say:** \"Technical knowledge alone won't make you successful—you must communicate effectively with clients. As Mustafa Waleed says, 'The client's most important question is often: Will my coffee machine work?'\n\nWhen explaining systems to clients, avoid technical terms. Don't say, 'This 5kW system with 48V battery bank will provide 25kWh daily.' Instead say, 'This system will run your refrigerator, lights, TV, and fans for 24 hours, and your air conditioner for 6 hours daily—all without needing the generator.'\"\n\n**Mosul-specific Mistake Example:** \"A common mistake in Mosul is assuming clients understand technical terms. One installer told clients their batteries would last '1500 cycles at 50% DOD.' The clients nodded politely but later complained that the system didn't meet their expectations. They had no idea what those specifications meant in practical terms. Always translate technical details into everyday benefits.\"\n\n## **Session 4: Reflect \\+ Connect (3:30-4:00)**\n\n### **Group Presentation (15 min)**\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n\n* Arrange seating for presentations  \n* Have a flip chart or board for noting key points  \n* Prepare simple feedback criteria for peers\n\n**Facilitation Steps:**\n\n1. Have each group briefly present their system design  \n2. Ask them to explain their key decisions and calculations  \n3. Encourage questions from other trainees  \n4. Provide constructive feedback on technical accuracy and communication  \n5. Highlight particularly effective approaches\n\n**What to Say:** \"Now each team will present their system design for the case study. Explain your load assessment, system sizing decisions, and how you would communicate the benefits to the client. Be prepared to defend your choices—just as you would with real clients who ask tough questions.\n\nAs you listen to other presentations, note different approaches.",
