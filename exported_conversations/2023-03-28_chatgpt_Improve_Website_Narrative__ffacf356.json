      "content": "I want to improve my webpage, I'm 37 years old, I have a long history of checkered accomplishments from being a screen printing business founder, running a Hackerspace, making a ton of weird digital/electronic projects, invisible graffiti, I am now running a non-profit social accelerator and I want to somehow find a coherent story to tell. I want my website to be inspiring people to hire me, pay me more, invite me to speak. I am innovative and creative and do technical things at Bloom.pm around AI and the future of work and data processing as well as facilitate the programs we run with teams. What do you think, can you help me find a coherent narrative, you can ask me some questions to help define the narrative and then we will work on constructing the website, including some of the talks I have given and old projects in a way so they make sense. You can search Bilalghalib.com for some idea of what I've done. You can start asking questions now",

      "content": "It's always been about communities and helping people find their way in the world for the screen printing company I wanted to find a way to use my creativity and my friends writing (to write copy for the business) to do the things we thought were awesome and get paid to do it. as I grew up it became more and more important for the things I've done to make a positive impact, so my robotics company we were working on recycling robots. and now I unlock human potential for positive change in the world through social enterprise support. I learn what I need to learn to follow my intuition of what's good and beautiful to do. So I got a masters degree in education in 2021 from the university of Paris.\nI would like to talk about my work on sensors and alternative sensory inputs for the human body, the wearable compass and my wearable face detection I think is pretty innovative and fun. also the flybrary is a potential business to help people with their library management and to allow people to make money on the books on their shelves. Also aiwayway which is an ai robotic drawing project\n3. I've been working on identifying what helps people develop wellbeing alongside their professional development and processing assessment data to identify best learning opportunities for people. \n4. I think my ink talk on hackerspaces everywhere and my talk good is hard in Vienna is great (I wish I had more talks more recently actually, maybe we can work on that later) they're all old before I got focused on building Bloom\n5. truth seeking, community and community support, creativity and innovation, making things to bring a smile to people, humor, insight, helping unlock values for positive change. \n6. I was an entrepreneur before I trained entrepreneurs. I am community building and know what it's like to live in Lebanon and be with the communities in the Middle East where I work and build community there.\n7. I love the Hackerspace I founded allhandsactive.com in 2009 is still running without me. I love the fact that I think I have been a part of many people's success stories in the hackerspaces that I have helped catalyze while working on my project GEMSI(the global entrepreneurship and make space initiative, founded 2011, closed 2018) you can see the website at gemsi.org - I'm proud of the crazy and creative projects I've done and they seem the least relevant, maybe you can tell me otherwise. I think they're hilarious and innovative. For instance I once made a smell guitar so people can have a concert without sound.\n9. I would like to speak on the future of work, ai, learning and education. using ai in education. Wellbeing for social entrepreneurship, post traumatic growth (my masters thesis was on post traumatic growth for the teams I was training in 2020 when the Beirut blast happened. I was conducing assessments and analyzed the data to identify the factors that helped people grow \n",
