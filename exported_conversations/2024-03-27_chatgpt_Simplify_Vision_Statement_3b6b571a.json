Is it primarily to create public spaces, to foster unity and understanding among diverse groups, or something else?\n\n2. How does your organization specifically plan to achieve this vision? For example, do you focus on certain activities or initiatives in these public spaces?\n\n3. What do you want people to feel or do as a result of your vision? For instance, is the emphasis on recognizing shared humanity, or on taking specific actions like love and service?",
