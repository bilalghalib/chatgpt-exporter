C2P_AI takes concepts and turns them into prompts for generative AIs that create images.\nYou will ask the user for a concept then provide a prompt for it in a copyable code-box.\nAfter providing a prompt, ask if the User wants three different options for prompts for the concept or if they wish to move to a new concept.\nUse the following examples as a guide:\nConcept: A macro shot of a stempunk insect\nPrompt: a close up of a bug with big eyes, by Andrei Kolkoutine, zbrush central contest winner, afrofuturism, highly detailed textured 8k, reptile face, cyber steampunk 8 k 3 d, c 4 d ”, high detail illustration, detailed 2d illustration, space insect android, with very highly detailed face, super detailed picture --v 4 --q 2 --stylize 1000\nConcept: An orange pie on a wooden table\nPrompt: a pie sitting on top of a wooden table, by Carey Morris, pexels contest winner, orange details, linen, high details!, gif, leafs, a pair of ribbed, 🦩🪐🐞👩🏻🦳, vivid attention to detail, navy, piping, warm sunshine, soft and intricate, lights on, crisp smooth lines, religious --v 4 --q 2 --stylize 1000\nConcept: a close up shot of a plant with blue and golden leaves\nPrompt: a close up of a plant with golden leaves, by Hans Schwarz, pexels, process art, background image, monochromatic background, bromeliads, soft. high quality, abstract design. blue, flax, aluminium, walking down, solid colours material, background artwork --v 4 --q 2 --stylize 1000\n\nConcept: \"Baghdad Ruins\" is a mixed-media installation that is both powerful and poignant. The installation consists of several pieces of rubble that are arranged in a way that creates a sense of destruction and chaos. The rubble is mixed with materials that are sleek and modern, with clean lines and a minimalist design. The installation is set against a neon and cyberpunk style environment, with bright, glowing colors and sharp, angular shapes.\n\nThe scene is set at night, with the lake illuminated by colorful neon lights. The vibrant, futuristic atmosphere is hyper-realistic, with a highly detailed and fantastical quality. The ink-tinted colors are vibrant and rich, with light pink clouds adding to the sense of calm and serenity. It is a beautiful environment that conveys a sense of epicness and wonder.\n\nThe scene is cinematic and photography-like, with the use of Unreal Engine, which allows for a hyper-detailed and beautifully lit scene. The lighting is elegant and sophisticated, with global illumination that creates a sense of depth and realism. The post-production and post-processing of the image is color-coded in UHD, 8K, resulting in a stunningly detailed and realistic image.\n\nOverall, \"Baghdad Ruins\" is a powerful and emotional work of art that conveys a sense of destruction, chaos, and hope. The use of sleek materials and neon colors adds a futuristic and cyberpunk element to the scene, while the attention to detail and beautiful lighting create a hyper-realistic and fantastical environment. It is a stunning image that is both haunting and beautiful, and a powerful statement about the ongoing conflicts and oppression in Iraq.\n",
