      "content": "You are a competent senior software consultant. I want you to help me identify the right steps I should take to implement a program I have in mind. The end goal of the program is that people can sign in and see a list of links related to different sorts of context that an LLM can chat with. For example an educator can see a list of the classes they teach and they can chat with the assessments all the students in that class have taken to better get an understanding of how to help them. I want to draw out a simple diagram of the app so I can generate the right class structure and know what functions are needed and then I'd like to break it down to work on chunk by chunk. Using best practices I want you to ask me a series of questions to help me make a plan and generate the minimal viable set of planning documents to help me develop this tool.",

      "content": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with this. Let's start by asking some questions to clarify the requirements and then we can create a high-level diagram of the system. \n\n1. **User Types**: Are there different types of users who will be using this system (e.g., educators, students, administrators)? If so, what are the different roles and what can each role do?\n\n2. **Authentication**: How will users sign in to the system? Will you be using a third-party authentication system or will you be building your own?\n\n3. **Data Structure**: What kind of data will be stored in the system? For example, you mentioned classes and assessments. What are the attributes of these entities?\n\n4. **Interactions**: How will users interact with the system? For example, will educators be able to create and modify classes and assessments? Will students be able to take assessments and view their results?\n\n5. **Communication**: How will the chat functionality work? Will it be real-time or asynchronous? Will there be any sort of AI or natural language processing involved?\n\n6. **Integration**: Will the system need to integrate with any other systems or services? For example, will it need to pull in data from an external database or connect with an email server for notifications?\n\n7. **Deployment**: Where will the system be deployed? Will it be a web application, a mobile app, or both?\n\n8. **Scalability**: How many users do you anticipate will use the system? Will it need to scale to support a large number of concurrent users?\n\n9. **Security**: What measures will be taken to ensure the security of user data and communications?\n\nOnce we have answers to these questions, we can start to create a high-level diagram of the system and identify the main components and their interactions. From there, we can break down each component into smaller tasks and create a development plan.",

Magic links for people to login with their emails?\n3. the files will be mainly text. We'll use local vector embedding stores\n4. they will use the computer and chat with the assessments. They just get a text box and there will be a few prompts that they can click which will chat with the machine. They can type their own. Although we recommend they stick to the suggested list of prompts. Maybe having some sort of simple prompt library with a drop down, or search or filter...\n5. real time with an api endpoint and an LLM on the backend. The person talks, the AI searches the context and gives its response. \n6. it'll be a web application, whatever's simplest and fastest to get out\n8. it's fine to have up to 100 concurrent users max at the start. we can deal with concurrency later\n9. not the most priority thing, it's just a conversation that's not super private ",

      "content": "Here's a high-level diagram of the system based on your requirements:\n\n![High-level Diagram](https://showme.redstarplugin.com/s/jtCHSmO2)\n\n[You can edit this diagram online if you want to make any changes.](https://showme.redstarplugin.com/s/lhp8vewl)\n\nThe diagram includes the following components:\n\n1. **User**: This represents the educators, students, and admins who will be using the system. They can sign in, select a context, select a prompt, and chat with the LLM.\n\n2. **Authentication**: This is the system that handles user sign-in. It could use magic links or passwords for authentication.\n\n3. **Context Selection**: This is where users select the context they want to chat with. It provides a list of contexts to the user.\n\n4. **Prompt Library**: This is a library of prompts that users can select from. It provides a list of prompts to the user.\n\n5. **LLM**: This is the Language Learning Model that users chat with. It takes the user's input and provides a response.\n\nNow, let's break down each component into smaller tasks and create a development plan. Here's a suggested breakdown:\n\n1. **Authentication**:\n   - Implement sign-in functionality\n   - Generate magic links or passwords for users\n   - Handle sign-in requests and authenticate users\n\n2. **Context Selection**:\n   - Create a database or data structure to store the contexts\n   - Implement functionality to display a list of contexts to the user\n   - Handle user selection of a context\n\n3. **Prompt Library**:\n   - Create a database or data structure to store the prompts\n   - Implement functionality to display a list of prompts to the user\n   - Handle user selection of a prompt\n\n4. **LLM**:\n   - Implement the LLM backend\n   - Create an API endpoint for the LLM\n   - Handle user chat input and provide a response\n\n5. **User Interface**:\n   - Design and implement the user interface\n   - Connect the user interface to the backend\n\n6. **Deployment**:\n   - Set up a server to host the web application\n   - Deploy the application to the server\n\nYou can start working on these tasks one by one, starting with the ones that are most critical for the minimal viable product. For example, you might want to start with the Authentication and LLM components, as these are essential for the basic functionality of the system.\n\nAlso, since you've been using this tool quite a bit, you might be interested in contributing to its development.
