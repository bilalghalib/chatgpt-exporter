            "extracted_content": "You are an expert writer and editor tasked with transforming a stream-of-consciousness text into a well-structured, long-form essay in the style of an economist or philosophy magazine article. Your goal is to preserve the original ideas and logic while improving clarity, organization, and depth.\n\nHere is the stream-of-consciousness text you need to work with:\n\n<stream_of_consciousness_text>\nAll right, so, today is December 3, 2024.\n\nThe last of year. Nine, here, eight, one.\n\nWe gonna leave.\n\nNice. Here. In um in the I top money and with chocolate pie, and some of the new top in my head. And work that I related to logical contact. And how they impact learning.\n\nI've been in the domain of learning for the majority of my open life. And a lot of the questions that people are asking, I think would change that we started thinking about the new.\n\nOne is kind of some third knowledge, the lady still the uh, and that with the int knowledge or um, theerior knowledge, uh, are kind of incompential.\n\nUm, but that what the challenge when we overeplies when the fire that is an abs bas and rew and we have turned and basically think there are many examples in history of horrible fun, actually. This person floats, uh, then she's awitch, and if she sinks when she was innocent, but she's drowned.\n\nThat's a that's a science.\n\nThere's some pause and effect and a worldview that interpreted that sense data that's worth here. So in the constant operation of our stuff out of working, there' bit green to sort of by the evidence. Or it's desperate attempts we have to constantly be imperring things and recognizing them because if we have a uh it is that the idea of not knowing what's happening or how things are happening, it is so problem that we're willing to make up the closest possible logical narrative about it.\n\nAnd I remember Ram Dass's teacher being given a strong psychic substance, and Ronass Ramdas's teacher essentially didn't have an experience or an impact of that experience.\n\nAnd I believe that is because the type of perception that the individual is the most associating herself for herself with, uh, is the noninferred knowledge itself, the one that knows from experience and of direct observation. There are many ways to get to that path.\n\nSo, for instance, you have meditation and mindfulness and settling into the moment, and I believe though, the thought and the priming that we can have will be very helpful to open less that method of interpretation that the presence and, you know, some people call it intuition, some people call it instin, some people talk about all these things and whether or not we can trust them, as if these things are meaningless.\n\nAnd I think that talking about these things in a way such that it will be able to be trusted by going by direction. One direction is we turned kind of deconstruct the idea that there's a knowable world out there that we can, uh touch sense feel and bump to sort of similar conclusions about. Without any dire know interfering with our interpretation.\n\nThat's there's like a raw data to that societies and then the um a line up.\n\nAnd once we did that, you know, we can explain how many times we thought we were right since retrograde motion was explained with a bunch of equations, and then they're like, well, you know, there's an easier way of explaining it, and that is that uh, we or around the sun, not the other way around.\n\nWe're not a heliocentric universe, we're actually, uh, something different, right?\n\nAnd so, the the issue is we thought with real confidence that we could explain with retrograde motion and equations and all sorts of things, and before, perhaps there were other explanations, um, and before we knew that they were stars and and planets and not stars, we thought they were all sorts of uh different things, and we had different interpretations kind of explain what we were experiencing.\n\nSo then I was take it back to public stuff, right?\n\nSo we're talking about two kinds of knowledge. Experiential that which we know by the holding and reflecting?\n\nSo that's the other thing.\n\nCan you know anything that you are not?\n\nSo when you see the beauty of a sunset, what part of you know that is beautiful?\n\nAnd there might be some ideas about resonance that we can bring in here that could put without some using avenues.\n\nAnd at the same time, we can continue this exploration and talk about the difference between that kind of knowing and its balance with the interpretive knowing.\n\nAnd when we start to realize that our knowledges are being confused and that we have uh overemphasized a sort of knowledge that is um provisional. And we do not hold that knowledge against any eternal knowledges. We disconnect ourselves with the past, and we disconnect ourselves with a a potential shared reality.\n\nThe and the other issue is we disconnect ourselves with meaning and purpose. And the Hello.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd now the other elements of the The way that we perceive the world can can come in.\n\nAnd of course, I'm not even talking about power structures and different ideas that are um attempting to influence um, perception and thought and I believe that there's a lot of that happening as well.\n\nAnd uh the thing that we can do is to work more and more on figuring out what the self is in relation to its knowledge.\n\nAnd, you know, there's a lot of these things that we try to figure out about the world, and we figure it out neglecting the figuring out mechanisms.\n\nSo we we look at the world and we interpret it, but we don't realize we're interpreting it through our filter and through narratives and stories that have to happen.\n\nThis idea of the default mode network and the mind constantly seeking a reasonable explanation, I think is related to not enough and this is where it's gonna get contested and debatable and religious, not enough trust in God.\n\nSo imagine this uh story of somebody just getting into a car accident, and he's bloodied.\n\nThe driver is dead, and the person the back seat talks through the sha in the front, the scholar in the front and he says, oh my God, are you okay?\n\nAnd the scholar says, yeah, no, no, don't worry about it.\n\nI've already prayedihara for this trip, meaning that he has confidence that God's choices are the most beautiful of all possible choices and good choices, and there's complete reliance.\n\nSo, if we think about the psychedelic experiences of Ram Das and and others and the possibility for unquotead trips, I don't think it's possible for somebody that is in that state.\n\nAnd this kind of trust in the world, I think allows for the acceptance of the uh complete uncertainty that is the not the uncertainty, but the openness to the doubt and mystery and awe and wonder that is really present in the world.\n\nAnd I think, you know, connecting it with need, I was imagining that if we had retained a sense of awe and mystery and wonder, is it possible that we would have never damaged our environment to such a degree?\n\nUm there people have long spoken about the hunter gatherer tribes and the amounts of time that they spend working versus telling stories and connecting, and their work is a short period of intensity followed by a long period of relaxation.\n\nAnd that sounds like you stress to me, and you stress is positive stress.\n\nIt's the stress that when you put an organism through it, they are enhanced because they have the recovery time. And this the social bonds, the types of um relationships that people form, and types of relationships that people are forming with the natural world and themselves is one of trust, because they're aligned with the natural cycles and the natural rhythms of things. And therefore they wind up getting the blessings of the seasons and of the ability to feast in the harvest season and the joy of the spring when things start to grow again.\n\nAnd we've uh developed a type of immunity in a sense to that world, and uh it's not an immunity, exactly.\n\nIt's a we've developed a an idea that through understanding the faintest elements of cause and effect and learning the ropes of the magic of God through our understanding of the natural forces, we attempt to cause the flowers to bloom in the winter with artificial the lit greenhouses that consume energy that wasn't for this time.\n\nThat was for our different time. That had blessed the earth thousands and thousands of years ago before turning into coal and turning into oil.\n\nAnd so with these types of systems that we barely understand and barely grasp, we are attempting to recreate the world based on false assumptions of our ability to handle the unity of self and world.\n\nAnd we peep through the temporality and we attempt to have a world that is more through our desires and our liking and on our timeline, and this isn't to say that we should not be attempting to be better farmers or to be more efficient with our harvests or to even process our food, even all very natural things.\n\nUh, so it is still a question to me, what differentiates a healthy planning and foresight and a unhealthy planning on foresight.\n\nAnd I'm the beneficiary of a trillion systems that are all coordinating, billions and millions of people, all working together to get my food on the table and there is an economy.\n\nAnd I think maybe the thing that we're looking to do with this thought process is to simply become more in the presence and to balance our understanding with our seeing.\n\nAnd when that happens, here's what I think can happen.\n\nWe will notice earlier signs of fish degrading, and we won't see them as outside and other we see them as a part of a unified hole, a dynamic and beautiful world that is a mysterious gift, that we are here to be more a part of and responsible for and keeping a balance in rather than taking and consuming as much as we possibly can and trying to expand the amount of consumption that we can do in the limited time we have while we're alive.\n\nI think there is a very different sort of worldview that is attuned to this important balance.\n\nAnd this relates to the two kinds of knowledges and some of the challenges of overemphasizing the knowledge of cause and effect, which necessitates the quantification, which is related to time ticking one after another, and in each snapshot in each instant, we can take a measurement in the fractions of a second and our better sensors go down to micro fractions.\n\nAnd so there's time, position and energy or velocity being the three the trifecta.\n\nAnd with that, we can try to glue together to complete whole truths of a reality that is right now.\n\nAnd that includes a sense of fear where this extrapolation goes to thinking of a reduction or a loss in the future, and the more we actually see right now, what is the present moment offering?\n\nWhat is the the sense of knowing what is the knowing that is here?\n\nUh, there has to be this balance.\n\nAnd I think that's the difference that's the balance here between trust and fear.\n\nSo we can we can be in this moment and completely in and and this allows the idea of enjoyment, because we can be in this moment and accept that we are blessed to be full enough, conscious, aware and touching reality, and at the same time have the other eye open to seeing that we must be also careful and cautious and making plans to be safe and participate in the creation of the future, so plant the seeds, but appreciate the harvest.\n\nThere's something here.\n\nThis is my journal for the day. \n</stream_of_consciousness_text>\n\nPlease follow these steps to create your essay:\n\n1.

            "extracted_content": "1. the sense I get of love and joy when I'm with my baby, or the amazement when I see dolfins in the ocean - it isn't interpreted - somehow it's clear, if people asked I couldn't defend it. Which makes these ways of knowing lesser than in the modern world. The more correct answer would relate to some evolutionary adaptation or a curiosity that inspires us to learn about and survive in a hostile world or something\n2. I don't know, I'd love your perspective, how can we possibly know what it feels like to live in a society which builds these sorts of minds? Do they qualitatively have different architecture and structure? Could they be unknowable and could it be impossible to gain access to these ways of being/seeing without being raised in an entire society with a different paradigm?\n3. I wonder about that too, I think this brings us to some of the curx of the issue, time is money, and tick,tock implies dollars and cents - and exchange of now for an enjoyment later as opposed to a lived experience of now where our morality can show up. I think there's a disconnection between actions and morality living on clock time as opposed to being in the now, witnessing our moral actions. The idea of a traitor going against their own nations in exchange for money requires mental time travel - the blessed financial future in exchange of the non-existant now where we don't live with ourselves doing the crime\n4. Yeah, who can know anyone, let alone yourself. All the text, all the language you've written might be able to be fed into an Ai which can write like you - reading that, does it feel like yourself? Or is i tyourself that can choose a new way, decide to be unlike your past. That freedom is connected to the principle of life and being and no matter how accurate something can be that's trained on your past, is it you? Let's imagine it responds to new situations and the new content is fed back into it... does it evolve? Has it extracted some meta principles that set the fundamental trends of your life that would allow it to also have growth/directionality? Isn't the joy of being connected ot being surprised at who you can be and who you've become when you connect to deeper values that guide you in shaping a potentially different you in the future?\n5. I mean the idea that if we trust in God / the universe / if we have enough access to Sat Chit Ananda - somehow can we know the reality of things is Goodness? Perhaps the knowledge of the extremely privledged position of the earth with all the unlikely coincidences it takes to create life, and all the people in our family tree that had to survive to produce us and all the factors at play to give us the moment of contemplation - that one moment is such an immense gift that perhaps that's enough to give one a sense that whatever the origins of our conciousness is - it must be good. I'm not sure if this is a logical argument. Otherwise we must trust the Sufis, the taoists, the vedic people who see being conciousness and bliss being the foundational elements, that mercy overcomes all things. Once we have this trust, perhaps we can create a chain of trust from there to where we are - realizing that we can rest easy - that even with all the difficulties we see bound to a temporal reality that expanding our perspective to an atemporal one that can witness a family tree like a root structure and see its improbability, or a time saussae of the universe where we see all the causes that were necessarry for conciousness to be able to self reflect in a body we'd even be amazed at the blessing of pain because the contrast to that isn't the annihalation of a people, a species, the oposite is actually non-existance - nothing needed to be at all, the ultimate tradgedy isn't death, it's void - and the blessing to see the presence of things and the presence of a witness even for a flash of insight is indeed wonderful. Being is here. Conciousness is here... how about Bliss, how do we know that is an element of reality? What are we trusting in exactly? Help me understand - what am i missing, what things could i have said that i haven't what perspectives are missing? \n\nDo you have more questions or is it time to restructure our essay and start writing?"

Yet paradoxically, such experiences are often dismissed as lesser forms of knowledge in our modern paradigm, which privileges interpretive understanding over direct experience.\n\nThis privileging of interpretive knowledge reveals a fundamental crisis in how we understand ourselves and our world. We have created sophisticated frameworks for explaining reality through cause and effect, measurement, and logical inference. But in doing so, we may have unconsciously constructed mental architectures that limit our access to other ways of knowing—ways that characterized human experience for most of our species' history and continue to shape indigenous worldviews today.\n\nThe distinction becomes clearer when we examine how different societies structure their relationship with time. Modern industrial society operates on what we might call \"clock time\"—a quantified, commodified approach where time becomes money and the present moment is constantly exchanged for imagined future returns. This temporal framework shapes not just our economic activities but our moral architecture. The very possibility of certain modern ethical transgressions—like betraying long-term commitments for immediate financial gain—requires the ability to mentally time-travel, to prioritize an imagined future over the lived present.\n\nIn contrast, societies that maintain closer connections to natural rhythms often exhibit different relationships with both time and knowledge. Hunter-gatherer communities, for instance, typically alternate between periods of intense activity and extended relaxation—a pattern that mirrors natural cycles and allows for deep social bonding. Their knowledge systems often emphasize direct observation and experiential understanding over abstract theorizing. This is not to romanticize pre-modern societies, but rather to highlight how different social structures create different ways of knowing.\n\nThe implications extend beyond anthropological curiosity. Our modern emphasis on interpretive knowledge has enabled remarkable technological achievements but may have simultaneously disconnected us from crucial forms of understanding. Consider environmental degradation: would we have damaged our natural systems so extensively if we had maintained a more balanced relationship between analytical understanding and direct experiential knowledge of our environment? The question isn't merely rhetorical—it points to practical challenges in how we approach contemporary problems.\n\nThis disconnection manifests in our attempts to control nature rather than work within its rhythms. We build artificially lit greenhouses to force summer flowers in winter, burning ancient sunlight stored as fossil fuels to defy seasonal cycles. While such innovations demonstrate human ingenuity, they also reveal a kind of hubris—an overconfidence in our ability to understand and manipulate complex natural systems through purely interpretive knowledge.\n\nThe path forward likely involves finding ways to balance these different modes of knowing. This doesn't mean abandoning scientific understanding or technological progress. Rather, it suggests developing frameworks that can hold both types of knowledge in creative tension. Trust plays a crucial role here—not blind faith, but a grounded trust in the fundamental goodness of existence, what some traditions call Sat Chit Ananda (being-consciousness-bliss).\n\nSuch trust might seem naive in our cynical age. Yet consider the improbability of our existence—the precise conditions required for life, the unbroken chain of survivors in our ancestral line, the remarkable fact of consciousness itself. This recognition can foster a kind of cosmic gratitude that allows us to remain open to mystery while engaging in rational inquiry.\n\nThe challenge lies in maintaining this balance while navigating real-world problems. We need both the precision of quantitative analysis and the wisdom of direct experience. We need careful planning for the future and deep presence in the current moment. Most importantly, we need to recognize that different ways of knowing aren't hierarchical alternatives but complementary approaches to understanding our complex reality.\n\nThis reconciliation becomes increasingly urgent as we face unprecedented global challenges. Climate change, biodiversity loss, and social fragmentation can't be addressed through technical solutions alone. They require us to fundamentally reimagine our relationship with knowledge itself—to create new mental architectures that can bridge the divide between interpretive and experiential understanding.\n\nThe path forward may lie in cultivating what we might call \"enlightened planning\"—approaches that maintain technological sophistication while remaining grounded in direct experience and natural rhythms. This could help us distinguish between healthy foresight that respects natural systems and unhealthy attempts to override them. The future of human flourishing may depend on our ability to navigate this delicate balance.\n</essay>",

            "extracted_content": "1. altered states of consciousness offer a temporary rewiring of our minds, bridging elements that were not bridged, offering a sense of safety in the case of MDMA. For anyone who has attempted these substances they seem to offer a new angle on our sensory perception and what we think \"normal\" is. It still seems to me that set and setting matters a lot in our experience and interpretation of our experience, one of the fundamental \"sets\" that we have is the cognitive frames and schemas we have about what the mind is (my brain is experiencing a sort of synesthesia because of the way psilocybin causes the networks of the brain to cross communicate) vs (I am one with the universe of love.) - It isn't really clear that pysychadellics are able to offer an alternative perspective without ideas. This relates to the idea of transmitted knowledge vs derivable knowledge and their relationship. We can derive knowledge from the world, except that transmitted knowledge often limits our ability to see - we can give the example of retrograde motion and the transmitted knowledge that the sun and planets orbit the earth and how derived knowledge had to do some backflips in order to preserve a sense of meaning. A revolutionary way to see information / sense perception / a copernican shift in conciousness might be close, and once it's accepted, perhaps many things will be renewed and reinterpreted and made right/whole/balanced without the mental gymnastics cutting \"I'm just doing my job\" while we see that perhaps the job shouldn't exist at all \"I must feed my family\" \"they did it first/started it\" - these things in the light of developmental psychology is in a sense one way to describe the copernican shift in decentering the self, and recognizing conciousness as a gift we partake in. \n2. i think the amount of time they've been shown to be telling stories vs \"working\" - and the definition - we call them hunter gatherers - they probably wouldn't identify with how they were able to \"earn their sustinance\" - perhaps they'd call themselves story tellers, or people blessed by the earth that provides - I don't know enough about them or have the greatest stories, although I do think this intuition about what modern people \"name\" them demonstrates the doing orientation - what is the issue with the doing orientation? perhaps it's related to the idea of being outside of the now time, that we do these things for some final cause that will forever be beyond us because we never arrive. we do work so we can do eating and housing and we do entertainment to \"destress\" so we can prepare for tomorrow - we do all these things without thinking, threading one moment to the next till we wind up in hospice doing death and then there is a cut, a temporal terminal point - perhaps as we approach it we can wake up to presence. many people with near death experiences drastically shift their lives, the reasearch on their decisions and explanations of their decision making can be interesting. What would economic models of the world be like if everyone who was a banker and had a near death experience became a yoga teacher, are there cases where people actually open ethical banks? Can society, especially modern society, survive without significant changes to the infrastructure if more humans achieved more being states, where the trade of the future prize, the heaven we are promised if we work hard and do xyz - vs realizing the heaven in the now, and th ealignment with sat chit ananda and how that connects to the ethical argument - that being in time is fundamental to noticing who you want to be, this permanent forever that the moment holds is a lifetime of anguish if you hate yourself for what you're doing even if there's a future goal that makes it \"worth it\" - crime, violence, treachery - even to your very soul. some people think I'll work in Finance to pay off my student loans and then never leave manhattan - the finish line moves ever further into the future because all of society is goal and future oriented. The anguish when the GDP doesn't grow year on year is one way to see this. what happens to the world when more present based people exist, more people have near death experiences, or otherwise find a shift in their understanding of time, ethics, being, action, we need mountains to hold the earth down, what would a mountain of presence within individuals be like? \n3. I didn't want to get too religious in this discussion which is why I'm attempting to describe things as philosophically as possible and to find cross religious/tradition examples, especially including examples of philosophers, taoists, bhuddists who don't have a supernatural faith to back up my claims and arguments. if you think it's important to bring in God, my perpsective is the Islamic one, one might call it Sufi, except I refuse to suggest that being a sufi means you're not a muslim in a traditional way. God is being, fundamental being, necessary being. God has no beginning, or ending, god is unlike anything in the created domain, and god has no needs. God's lack of need might be a mirror for man is created in God's image, the more \"real\" world in the muslim tradition is the everlasting world. We are contingent beings, able to understand the universe as infinite signs of God as everything that is created and contingent points to that which isn't - and the qualities of the divine is present in all things, innerworld, and outerworld. Additionally this creative force, is all knowledgable and knows all that is, was, all that isn't and could have been and all that couldn't be and could never have been. This total knowledge is is combined iwth his total will and his total power as well as his all seeing and all hearingness, including his ability to uniquely see and hear and know himself. The only other name of God in the muslim tradition that stands uniquely on its own is Al Rahman, the most merciful - not to muslims, to all reality. This fundamental Merci is the recognition in Sat Chit Ananda - and creates the axioms for a divine unfolding reality. One metaphor we can refer to is that of the mandlebrot set, infinite - yet has a beginning - like humanity. And the \"limits\" that allow the unfolding are defined in its equation, our \"equation\" are the fundamental qualities of God as described above and on top of that the definition he established for himself that \"his mercy overcomes his wrath\" and that \"The Most Merciful (Al Rahman) sits on the throne of power, that caues, and can be seen as the firmament upon which unfolding happens. This is what we can know through direct experience, contemplation and reflection as God continuously asks us to od in the quran. This is why in suratul baqara God starts with the book that has no doubt in it, a guidance for the god concious believers, the believers who believe in the unseen and have a firm confidence, as if they can see it, of the next - and eternal - life. We are created rational creatures and we cannot have confidence in the unseen or the afterlife if it was not acheivable through our faculties. The question is do people have the humility to be in awe? The presence to experience the knowlede that can be reflected in the mirror of the heart? All this language is sufi/islamic and religious and might not be relevant for the article, what are the pros and cons of including it, help me think through it and if it can be formulated in a productive way for this essay.\n4. I described already some of the ethical dilemmas that come when people project onto the future and make exceptions in the now for behavior. not knowing or believing that this snapshot in the time suassage of 4d reality can be a moment of eternity, hanging in a 3d universe sized photo frame where the torment of neglecting ones present self and the guilt that comes from doing what one knows to be harmful and evil yet in a sense the cost benefit goal oriented process convinced them that it's ok to create this black spot in a time saussage of eternity. The question of how big is that slice? is it big enough to experience? Different people percieve the passage of time differently and the gut wrenching experience of anxiety has a temporal dimension as it's hormonal and neuralogical - when we feel anything how big is it on the time dimension. Laughter is an interesting way to create dynamic fluctuations to allow for joy to persist over the course of time \n5. in my prior writing I described how the real evil is void and how sat chit ananda can be achieved by a rational walk through the unlikeliness and the awe and humility and amazement that we are here and can hold eachothers hands and can tickle a baby, it's incredible!"

      "content": " This new material adds crucial depth around altered states of consciousness, religious perspectives, and the relationship between time and ethics. Let me incorporate these insights into a revised essay.\n\n\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"knowledge-consciousness-essay\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"The Architecture of Knowing: Time, Consciousness, and Truth\">\n# The Architecture of Knowing: Time, Consciousness, and Truth\n\nIn our modern world, the most profound forms of knowing are often the least defensible. A parent gazing at their child experiences a form of knowledge as real as any scientific measurement, yet one that resists reduction to evolutionary psychology or neurochemistry. This paradox points to a deeper crisis in how we understand knowledge itself—a crisis that may require nothing less than a Copernican revolution in consciousness to resolve.\n\n## The Limits of Interpretive Knowledge\n\nOur current epistemological framework privileges interpretive knowledge—the kind that can be measured, quantified, and defended through logical argumentation. Yet history repeatedly shows the limitations of this approach. Consider the elaborate mathematical models created to explain planetary retrograde motion while preserving the geocentric worldview. Like modern bankers justifying ethically questionable practices with \"I'm just doing my job,\" these mental gymnastics reveal how transmitted knowledge can constrain our ability to see reality clearly.\n\nPsychedelic experiences offer a striking window into these limitations. Whether through psilocybin, MDMA, or other substances, these altered states temporarily rewire our neural architecture, creating novel bridges between typically separate mental domains. Yet even these experiences are profoundly shaped by set and setting—including our conceptual frameworks about consciousness itself. A neuroscientist might experience \"cross-communicating brain networks,\" while another might encounter \"universal consciousness.\" The interpretation shapes the experience, even as the experience challenges our interpretive frameworks.\n\n## Time, Ethics, and Presence\n\nPerhaps nowhere is our epistemological crisis more evident than in our relationship with time. Modern society operates on what we might call \"clock time\"—a quantified framework where present moments are continuously traded for future returns. This temporal architecture shapes not just our economics but our ethics. The ability to betray one's values for future gain requires a specific relationship with time—one that prioritizes projected outcomes over lived experience.\n\nThis becomes particularly clear when we examine societies with different temporal frameworks. Hunter-gatherer communities—better understood as storytellers blessed by the earth than as mere subsistence workers—typically spend far more time in communal storytelling than in what we would call \"work.\" Their relationship with time enables a different kind of ethical framework, one grounded in present awareness rather than future projections.\n\n## The Role of Trust and Ultimate Reality\n\nAt the heart of this epistemological revolution lies a fundamental question of trust. Whether framed in religious terms—as in the Islamic concept of God as necessary being and fundamental mercy—or in philosophical ones like Sat Chit Ananda (being-consciousness-bliss), this trust enables a different relationship with uncertainty and knowing.\n\nThis trust isn't blind faith but can be approached through rational contemplation. Consider the extraordinary improbability of consciousness itself—the precise conditions required for life, the unbroken chain of survivors in our ancestral line, the remarkable fact of self-awareness. These considerations can lead to a kind of cosmic gratitude that allows us to remain open to mystery while engaging in rational inquiry.\n\n## Towards a New Architecture of Consciousness\n\nThe path forward may require what we might call a decentering of the self—a recognition that consciousness is not a possession but a gift we partake in. This shift could enable new ways of knowing that bridge the divide between interpretive and direct experience.\n\nNear-death experiences offer a compelling window into such possibilities. Research shows that these experiences often catalyze dramatic life changes—bankers becoming yoga teachers, materialists embracing spiritual practices. While society couldn't function if everyone made such dramatic shifts simultaneously, these experiences point to the possibility of more balanced ways of knowing and being.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nThis epistemological revolution has practical implications for how we address contemporary challenges. Our environmental crisis, for instance, might be understood as a crisis of knowing—an overreliance on interpretive knowledge at the expense of direct experience of our embeddedness in natural systems.\n\nThe solution isn't to abandon rational inquiry but to develop new frameworks that can hold both types of knowledge in creative tension. This might involve:\n\n- Recognizing the validity of direct, experiential knowledge alongside interpretive frameworks\n- Developing educational approaches that cultivate both analytical and contemplative capabilities\n- Creating economic systems that respect natural rhythms rather than attempting to override them\n- Fostering social structures that enable present-moment awareness alongside future planning\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe challenge before us is not merely philosophical but practical and urgent. As we face unprecedented global challenges, we need ways of knowing that can bridge the divide between analytical understanding and direct experience. This may require nothing less than a fundamental reimagining of consciousness itself—one that recognizes knowing not as a possession but as a participation in something far greater than ourselves.\n</antArtifact>\n\nWould you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this essay or make any adjustments to better capture your perspective?",

While society couldn't function if everyone made such dramatic shifts simultaneously, these experiences point to the possibility of more balanced ways of knowing and being.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nThis epistemological revolution has practical implications for how we address contemporary challenges. Our environmental crisis, for instance, might be understood as a crisis of knowing—an overreliance on interpretive knowledge at the expense of direct experience of our embeddedness in natural systems.\n\nThe solution isn't to abandon rational inquiry but to develop new frameworks that can hold both types of knowledge in creative tension. This might involve:\n\n- Recognizing the validity of direct, experiential knowledge alongside interpretive frameworks\n- Developing educational approaches that cultivate both analytical and contemplative capabilities\n- Creating economic systems that respect natural rhythms rather than attempting to override them\n- Fostering social structures that enable present-moment awareness alongside future planning\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe challenge before us is not merely philosophical but practical and urgent. As we face unprecedented global challenges, we need ways of knowing that can bridge the divide between analytical understanding and direct experience. This may require nothing less than a fundamental reimagining of consciousness itself—one that recognizes knowing not as a possession but as a participation in something far greater than ourselves.\n</antArtifact>\n\nWould you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this essay or make any adjustments to better capture your perspective?",

Your goal is to preserve the original ideas and logic while improving clarity, organization, and depth.\\n\\nHere is the stream-of-consciousness text you need to work with:\\n\\n<stream_of_consciousness_text>\\nAll right, so, today is December 3, 2024.\\n\\nThe last of year. Nine, here, eight, one.\\n\\nWe gonna leave.\\n\\nNice. Here. In um in the I top money and with chocolate pie, and some of the new top in my head. And work that I related to logical contact. And how they impact learning.\\n\\nI've been in the domain of learning for the majority of my open life. And a lot of the questions that people are asking, I think would change that we started thinking about the new.\\n\\nOne is kind of some third knowledge, the lady still the uh, and that with the int knowledge or um, theerior knowledge, uh, are kind of incompential.\\n\\nUm, but that what the challenge when we overeplies when the fire that is an abs bas and rew and we have turned and basically think there are many examples in history of horrible fun, actually. This person floats, uh, then she's awitch, and if she sinks when she was innocent, but she's drowned.\\n\\nThat's a that's a science.\\n\\nThere's some pause and effect and a worldview that interpreted that sense data that's worth here. So in the constant operation of our stuff out of working, there' bit green to sort of by the evidence. Or it's desperate attempts we have to constantly be imperring things and recognizing them because if we have a uh it is that the idea of not knowing what's happening or how things are happening, it is so problem that we're willing to make up the closest possible logical narrative about it.\\n\\nAnd I remember Ram Dass's teacher being given a strong psychic substance, and Ronass Ramdas's teacher essentially didn't have an experience or an impact of that experience.\\n\\nAnd I believe that is because the type of perception that the individual is the most associating herself for herself with, uh, is the noninferred knowledge itself, the one that knows from experience and of direct observation. There are many ways to get to that path.\\n\\nSo, for instance, you have meditation and mindfulness and settling into the moment, and I believe though, the thought and the priming that we can have will be very helpful to open less that method of interpretation that the presence and, you know, some people call it intuition, some people call it instin, some people talk about all these things and whether or not we can trust them, as if these things are meaningless.\\n\\nAnd I think that talking about these things in a way such that it will be able to be trusted by going by direction. One direction is we turned kind of deconstruct the idea that there's a knowable world out there that we can, uh touch sense feel and bump to sort of similar conclusions about. Without any dire know interfering with our interpretation.\\n\\nThat's there's like a raw data to that societies and then the um a line up.\\n\\nAnd once we did that, you know, we can explain how many times we thought we were right since retrograde motion was explained with a bunch of equations, and then they're like, well, you know, there's an easier way of explaining it, and that is that uh, we or around the sun, not the other way around.\\n\\nWe're not a heliocentric universe, we're actually, uh, something different, right?\\n\\nAnd so, the the issue is we thought with real confidence that we could explain with retrograde motion and equations and all sorts of things, and before, perhaps there were other explanations, um, and before we knew that they were stars and and planets and not stars, we thought they were all sorts of uh different things, and we had different interpretations kind of explain what we were experiencing.\\n\\nSo then I was take it back to public stuff, right?\\n\\nSo we're talking about two kinds of knowledge. Experiential that which we know by the holding and reflecting?\\n\\nSo that's the other thing.\\n\\nCan you know anything that you are not?\\n\\nSo when you see the beauty of a sunset, what part of you know that is beautiful?\\n\\nAnd there might be some ideas about resonance that we can bring in here that could put without some using avenues.\\n\\nAnd at the same time, we can continue this exploration and talk about the difference between that kind of knowing and its balance with the interpretive knowing.\\n\\nAnd when we start to realize that our knowledges are being confused and that we have uh overemphasized a sort of knowledge that is um provisional. And we do not hold that knowledge against any eternal knowledges. We disconnect ourselves with the past, and we disconnect ourselves with a a potential shared reality.\\n\\nThe and the other issue is we disconnect ourselves with meaning and purpose. And the Hello.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nAnd now the other elements of the The way that we perceive the world can can come in.\\n\\nAnd of course, I'm not even talking about power structures and different ideas that are um attempting to influence um, perception and thought and I believe that there's a lot of that happening as well.\\n\\nAnd uh the thing that we can do is to work more and more on figuring out what the self is in relation to its knowledge.\\n\\nAnd, you know, there's a lot of these things that we try to figure out about the world, and we figure it out neglecting the figuring out mechanisms.\\n\\nSo we we look at the world and we interpret it, but we don't realize we're interpreting it through our filter and through narratives and stories that have to happen.\\n\\nThis idea of the default mode network and the mind constantly seeking a reasonable explanation, I think is related to not enough and this is where it's gonna get contested and debatable and religious, not enough trust in God.\\n\\nSo imagine this uh story of somebody just getting into a car accident, and he's bloodied.\\n\\nThe driver is dead, and the person the back seat talks through the sha in the front, the scholar in the front and he says, oh my God, are you okay?\\n\\nAnd the scholar says, yeah, no, no, don't worry about it.\\n\\nI've already prayedihara for this trip, meaning that he has confidence that God's choices are the most beautiful of all possible choices and good choices, and there's complete reliance.\\n\\nSo, if we think about the psychedelic experiences of Ram Das and and others and the possibility for unquotead trips, I don't think it's possible for somebody that is in that state.\\n\\nAnd this kind of trust in the world, I think allows for the acceptance of the uh complete uncertainty that is the not the uncertainty, but the openness to the doubt and mystery and awe and wonder that is really present in the world.\\n\\nAnd I think, you know, connecting it with need, I was imagining that if we had retained a sense of awe and mystery and wonder, is it possible that we would have never damaged our environment to such a degree?\\n\\nUm there people have long spoken about the hunter gatherer tribes and the amounts of time that they spend working versus telling stories and connecting, and their work is a short period of intensity followed by a long period of relaxation.\\n\\nAnd that sounds like you stress to me, and you stress is positive stress.\\n\\nIt's the stress that when you put an organism through it, they are enhanced because they have the recovery time. And this the social bonds, the types of um relationships that people form, and types of relationships that people are forming with the natural world and themselves is one of trust, because they're aligned with the natural cycles and the natural rhythms of things. And therefore they wind up getting the blessings of the seasons and of the ability to feast in the harvest season and the joy of the spring when things start to grow again.\\n\\nAnd we've uh developed a type of immunity in a sense to that world, and uh it's not an immunity, exactly.\\n\\nIt's a we've developed a an idea that through understanding the faintest elements of cause and effect and learning the ropes of the magic of God through our understanding of the natural forces, we attempt to cause the flowers to bloom in the winter with artificial the lit greenhouses that consume energy that wasn't for this time.\\n\\nThat was for our different time. That had blessed the earth thousands and thousands of years ago before turning into coal and turning into oil.\\n\\nAnd so with these types of systems that we barely understand and barely grasp, we are attempting to recreate the world based on false assumptions of our ability to handle the unity of self and world.\\n\\nAnd we peep through the temporality and we attempt to have a world that is more through our desires and our liking and on our timeline, and this isn't to say that we should not be attempting to be better farmers or to be more efficient with our harvests or to even process our food, even all very natural things.\\n\\nUh, so it is still a question to me, what differentiates a healthy planning and foresight and a unhealthy planning on foresight.\\n\\nAnd I'm the beneficiary of a trillion systems that are all coordinating, billions and millions of people, all working together to get my food on the table and there is an economy.\\n\\nAnd I think maybe the thing that we're looking to do with this thought process is to simply become more in the presence and to balance our understanding with our seeing.\\n\\nAnd when that happens, here's what I think can happen.\\n\\nWe will notice earlier signs of fish degrading, and we won't see them as outside and other we see them as a part of a unified hole, a dynamic and beautiful world that is a mysterious gift, that we are here to be more a part of and responsible for and keeping a balance in rather than taking and consuming as much as we possibly can and trying to expand the amount of consumption that we can do in the limited time we have while we're alive.\\n\\nI think there is a very different sort of worldview that is attuned to this important balance.\\n\\nAnd this relates to the two kinds of knowledges and some of the challenges of overemphasizing the knowledge of cause and effect, which necessitates the quantification, which is related to time ticking one after another, and in each snapshot in each instant, we can take a measurement in the fractions of a second and our better sensors go down to micro fractions.\\n\\nAnd so there's time, position and energy or velocity being the three the trifecta.\\n\\nAnd with that, we can try to glue together to complete whole truths of a reality that is right now.\\n\\nAnd that includes a sense of fear where this extrapolation goes to thinking of a reduction or a loss in the future, and the more we actually see right now, what is the present moment offering?\\n\\nWhat is the the sense of knowing what is the knowing that is here?\\n\\nUh, there has to be this balance.\\n\\nAnd I think that's the difference that's the balance here between trust and fear.\\n\\nSo we can we can be in this moment and completely in and and this allows the idea of enjoyment, because we can be in this moment and accept that we are blessed to be full enough, conscious, aware and touching reality, and at the same time have the other eye open to seeing that we must be also careful and cautious and making plans to be safe and participate in the creation of the future, so plant the seeds, but appreciate the harvest.\\n\\nThere's something here.\\n\\nThis is my journal for the day. \\n</stream_of_consciousness_text>\\n\\nPlease follow these steps to create your essay:\\n\\n1.

This question, far from being merely philosophical, lies at the heart of our relationship with the natural world and our approach to solving global challenges. Two distinct forms of knowledge compete for our attention: experiential knowledge, born of direct observation and presence, and interpretive knowledge, derived from analysis and measurement. The tension between these approaches, and our modern tendency to favor the latter, may be at the root of our current ecological crisis.\\n\\nConsider the evolution of human understanding. Throughout history, we have witnessed dramatic shifts in our interpretation of reality. The Ptolemaic model of the universe, with its complex equations explaining retrograde planetary motion, seemed irrefutable until Copernicus proposed a simpler, heliocentric model. This historical example illustrates a crucial point: our most confident interpretations of reality can be fundamentally mistaken, even when supported by sophisticated mathematical models and careful observation.\\n\\nThe modern scientific worldview, while immensely powerful, has led to an overemphasis on interpretive knowledge at the expense of direct experience. We have developed what might be called an \\\"immunity\\\" to the natural world – not in the biological sense, but in our psychological relationship with nature. This immunity manifests in our attempt to control natural processes, exemplified by our use of energy-intensive greenhouses to grow summer flowers in winter, utilizing fossil fuels that represent millions of years of stored solar energy.\\n\\nThis disconnection becomes particularly apparent when we examine hunter-gatherer societies, which maintain a fundamentally different relationship with the natural world. These communities typically engage in intense periods of work followed by extended periods of relaxation and social bonding – a pattern that mirrors natural cycles and what modern science recognizes as beneficial \\\"eustress.\\\" Their approach to knowledge integrates both direct experience and careful observation, maintaining a balance that modern society has largely lost.\\n\\nThe consequences of our imbalanced approach to knowledge extend beyond environmental degradation. Our reliance on interpretive knowledge has led to what philosopher Ram Dass observed in his studies of consciousness: a fundamental disconnection from direct experience. This disconnection manifests in our constant need to create narratives and explanations, even when facing situations that might better be met with presence and acceptance.\\n\\n[Continued in next part due to length...]\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"1. the sense I get of love and joy when I'm with my baby, or the amazement when I see dolfins in the ocean - it isn't interpreted - somehow it's clear, if people asked I couldn't defend it. Which makes these ways of knowing lesser than in the modern world. The more correct answer would relate to some evolutionary adaptation or a curiosity that inspires us to learn about and survive in a hostile world or something\\n2. I don't know, I'd love your perspective, how can we possibly know what it feels like to live in a society which builds these sorts of minds? Do they qualitatively have different architecture and structure? Could they be unknowable and could it be impossible to gain access to these ways of being/seeing without being raised in an entire society with a different paradigm?\\n3. I wonder about that too, I think this brings us to some of the curx of the issue, time is money, and tick,tock implies dollars and cents - and exchange of now for an enjoyment later as opposed to a lived experience of now where our morality can show up. I think there's a disconnection between actions and morality living on clock time as opposed to being in the now, witnessing our moral actions. The idea of a traitor going against their own nations in exchange for money requires mental time travel - the blessed financial future in exchange of the non-existant now where we don't live with ourselves doing the crime\\n4. Yeah, who can know anyone, let alone yourself. All the text, all the language you've written might be able to be fed into an Ai which can write like you - reading that, does it feel like yourself? Or is i tyourself that can choose a new way, decide to be unlike your past. That freedom is connected to the principle of life and being and no matter how accurate something can be that's trained on your past, is it you? Let's imagine it responds to new situations and the new content is fed back into it... does it evolve? Has it extracted some meta principles that set the fundamental trends of your life that would allow it to also have growth/directionality? Isn't the joy of being connected ot being surprised at who you can be and who you've become when you connect to deeper values that guide you in shaping a potentially different you in the future?\\n5. I mean the idea that if we trust in God / the universe / if we have enough access to Sat Chit Ananda - somehow can we know the reality of things is Goodness? Perhaps the knowledge of the extremely privledged position of the earth with all the unlikely coincidences it takes to create life, and all the people in our family tree that had to survive to produce us and all the factors at play to give us the moment of contemplation - that one moment is such an immense gift that perhaps that's enough to give one a sense that whatever the origins of our conciousness is - it must be good. I'm not sure if this is a logical argument. Otherwise we must trust the Sufis, the taoists, the vedic people who see being conciousness and bliss being the foundational elements, that mercy overcomes all things. Once we have this trust, perhaps we can create a chain of trust from there to where we are - realizing that we can rest easy - that even with all the difficulties we see bound to a temporal reality that expanding our perspective to an atemporal one that can witness a family tree like a root structure and see its improbability, or a time saussae of the universe where we see all the causes that were necessarry for conciousness to be able to self reflect in a body we'd even be amazed at the blessing of pain because the contrast to that isn't the annihalation of a people, a species, the oposite is actually non-existance - nothing needed to be at all, the ultimate tradgedy isn't death, it's void - and the blessing to see the presence of things and the presence of a witness even for a flash of insight is indeed wonderful. Being is here. Conciousness is here... how about Bliss, how do we know that is an element of reality? What are we trusting in exactly? Help me understand - what am i missing, what things could i have said that i haven't what perspectives are missing? \\n\\nDo you have more questions or is it time to restructure our essay and start writing?\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"assistant\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"Your comments add crucial depth and raise fascinating philosophical questions that should be incorporated into our essay.

For anyone who has attempted these substances they seem to offer a new angle on our sensory perception and what we think \\\"normal\\\" is. It still seems to me that set and setting matters a lot in our experience and interpretation of our experience, one of the fundamental \\\"sets\\\" that we have is the cognitive frames and schemas we have about what the mind is (my brain is experiencing a sort of synesthesia because of the way psilocybin causes the networks of the brain to cross communicate) vs (I am one with the universe of love.) - It isn't really clear that pysychadellics are able to offer an alternative perspective without ideas. This relates to the idea of transmitted knowledge vs derivable knowledge and their relationship. We can derive knowledge from the world, except that transmitted knowledge often limits our ability to see - we can give the example of retrograde motion and the transmitted knowledge that the sun and planets orbit the earth and how derived knowledge had to do some backflips in order to preserve a sense of meaning. A revolutionary way to see information / sense perception / a copernican shift in conciousness might be close, and once it's accepted, perhaps many things will be renewed and reinterpreted and made right/whole/balanced without the mental gymnastics cutting \\\"I'm just doing my job\\\" while we see that perhaps the job shouldn't exist at all \\\"I must feed my family\\\" \\\"they did it first/started it\\\" - these things in the light of developmental psychology is in a sense one way to describe the copernican shift in decentering the self, and recognizing conciousness as a gift we partake in. \\n2. i think the amount of time they've been shown to be telling stories vs \\\"working\\\" - and the definition - we call them hunter gatherers - they probably wouldn't identify with how they were able to \\\"earn their sustinance\\\" - perhaps they'd call themselves story tellers, or people blessed by the earth that provides - I don't know enough about them or have the greatest stories, although I do think this intuition about what modern people \\\"name\\\" them demonstrates the doing orientation - what is the issue with the doing orientation? perhaps it's related to the idea of being outside of the now time, that we do these things for some final cause that will forever be beyond us because we never arrive. we do work so we can do eating and housing and we do entertainment to \\\"destress\\\" so we can prepare for tomorrow - we do all these things without thinking, threading one moment to the next till we wind up in hospice doing death and then there is a cut, a temporal terminal point - perhaps as we approach it we can wake up to presence. many people with near death experiences drastically shift their lives, the reasearch on their decisions and explanations of their decision making can be interesting. What would economic models of the world be like if everyone who was a banker and had a near death experience became a yoga teacher, are there cases where people actually open ethical banks? Can society, especially modern society, survive without significant changes to the infrastructure if more humans achieved more being states, where the trade of the future prize, the heaven we are promised if we work hard and do xyz - vs realizing the heaven in the now, and th ealignment with sat chit ananda and how that connects to the ethical argument - that being in time is fundamental to noticing who you want to be, this permanent forever that the moment holds is a lifetime of anguish if you hate yourself for what you're doing even if there's a future goal that makes it \\\"worth it\\\" - crime, violence, treachery - even to your very soul. some people think I'll work in Finance to pay off my student loans and then never leave manhattan - the finish line moves ever further into the future because all of society is goal and future oriented. The anguish when the GDP doesn't grow year on year is one way to see this. what happens to the world when more present based people exist, more people have near death experiences, or otherwise find a shift in their understanding of time, ethics, being, action, we need mountains to hold the earth down, what would a mountain of presence within individuals be like? \\n3. I didn't want to get too religious in this discussion which is why I'm attempting to describe things as philosophically as possible and to find cross religious/tradition examples, especially including examples of philosophers, taoists, bhuddists who don't have a supernatural faith to back up my claims and arguments. if you think it's important to bring in God, my perpsective is the Islamic one, one might call it Sufi, except I refuse to suggest that being a sufi means you're not a muslim in a traditional way. God is being, fundamental being, necessary being. God has no beginning, or ending, god is unlike anything in the created domain, and god has no needs. God's lack of need might be a mirror for man is created in God's image, the more \\\"real\\\" world in the muslim tradition is the everlasting world. We are contingent beings, able to understand the universe as infinite signs of God as everything that is created and contingent points to that which isn't - and the qualities of the divine is present in all things, innerworld, and outerworld. Additionally this creative force, is all knowledgable and knows all that is, was, all that isn't and could have been and all that couldn't be and could never have been. This total knowledge is is combined iwth his total will and his total power as well as his all seeing and all hearingness, including his ability to uniquely see and hear and know himself. The only other name of God in the muslim tradition that stands uniquely on its own is Al Rahman, the most merciful - not to muslims, to all reality. This fundamental Merci is the recognition in Sat Chit Ananda - and creates the axioms for a divine unfolding reality. One metaphor we can refer to is that of the mandlebrot set, infinite - yet has a beginning - like humanity. And the \\\"limits\\\" that allow the unfolding are defined in its equation, our \\\"equation\\\" are the fundamental qualities of God as described above and on top of that the definition he established for himself that \\\"his mercy overcomes his wrath\\\" and that \\\"The Most Merciful (Al Rahman) sits on the throne of power, that caues, and can be seen as the firmament upon which unfolding happens. This is what we can know through direct experience, contemplation and reflection as God continuously asks us to od in the quran. This is why in suratul baqara God starts with the book that has no doubt in it, a guidance for the god conscious believers, the believers who believe in the unseen and have a firm confidence, as if they can see it, of the next - and eternal - life. We are created rational creatures, and we cannot have confidence in the unseen or the afterlife if it is not achievable through our faculties. The question is do people have the humility to be in awe? The presence to experience the knowlede that can be reflected in the mirror of the heart? All this language is sufi/islamic and religious and might not be relevant for the article, what are the pros and cons of including it, help me think through it and if it can be formulated in a productive way for this essay.\\n4. I described already some of the ethical dilemmas that come when people project onto the future and make exceptions in the now for behavior. not knowing or believing that this snapshot in the time sausage of 4d reality can be a moment of eternity, hanging in a 3d universe sized photo frame where the torment of neglecting ones present self and the guilt that comes from doing what one knows to be harmful and evil yet in a sense the cost benefit goal-oriented process convinced them that it's ok to create this black spot in a time sausage of eternity. The question of how big is that slice? is it big enough to experience? Different people perceive the passage of time differently, and the gut-wrenching experience of anxiety has a temporal dimension as it's hormonal and neurological - when we feel anything, how big is it on the time dimension? Laughter is an interesting way to create dynamic fluctuations to allow for joy to persist over the course of time \\n5. in my prior writing I described how the real evil is void and how sat chit ananda can be achieved by a rational walk through the unlikeliness and the awe and humility and amazement that we are here and can hold each others hands and can tickle a baby, it's incredible!\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"assistant\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"Your responses reveal even deeper layers. Before proceeding with the essay, I'd like to ask a few follow-up questions to ensure I fully capture your perspective:\\n\\n1.

Specifically, how does this decentering affect our relationship with both immediate experience and long-term planning?\\n\\n2. The contrast between \\\"doing orientation\\\" and being states is fascinating. You mentioned ethical banking - could you expand on how you envision practical institutions that could bridge this gap between being-oriented and doing-oriented approaches? What might a \\\"presence-based economy\\\" look like?\\n\\n3. Your explanation of the Islamic/Sufi perspective brings up interesting parallels with modern physics and mathematics (like the Mandelbrot set reference). Could you elaborate on how you see these mathematical/scientific concepts relating to spiritual truths? Are there other examples where you see modern science accidentally \\\"rediscovering\\\" ancient wisdom?\\n\\n4. The concept of \\\"time sausage\\\" and eternal moments is intriguing. Could you share more about how you see this relating to decision-making and ethical behavior? Perhaps some concrete examples of how different temporal perspectives lead to different ethical choices?\\n\\n5. Regarding the relationship between awe, rationality, and trust - could you expand on how you see these elements working together? How might someone maintain both scientific rigor and spiritual openness?\\n\\nThese follow-ups aim to gather more specific examples and clarify the connections between the various threads in your thinking. Would you like to address any of these before we move forward with the essay structure?\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"1. I believe intentionality and trust are key elements to act in presence. Sort of like David Allen says “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” - we can reflect, set direction, plan to align ourselves with the sense of the greatest good, the feeling of knowing that comes when we let go of fear and anxiety and ask what would the most beautiful way to act be, keep this constant reflection, inthe muslim tradition it's called muraja3a(reviewing) and muhasaba(taking ourselves to account) - together they frame the dynamic between planning, touching ground, sensing, and then in the day acting on our intentions, staying true, having faith and trust. \\n\\n2. having a sense of presence and trust can shift us from hoarding to relationship. if we can move into trust based economies knowing we are deeply integrated into social webs rather than isolated and protected by a moat of financial reserves, money for housing, money for food, money for medical care, money to distract us when we realize we're lonely - i believe that rather than measuring what we have in our bank (integral) we can measure how much money comes in/out (derivative) and that that is a sign of greater wealth because it indicates some of what (if properly aligned) our role is in the dynamics around us\\n\\n3. I believe that one way we can think about the emergence of the world is to imagine a 4 dimensional entity intersecting with a 3D plane. The idea of the unseen are all the 4d objects impossible for our 3d trained eyes/minds to see, yet we can recognize their patterns. Like a dot becoming a disk growing and shrinking back into a dot can be interpreted as a 3d ball enters a 2d plane, yet looks miraculous to the 2d beings, we can see the patterns and acknowledge that there might be an unseen dimension, one which has patterns we can know in our world that help us build trust. FOr instance things are, and they are consistent - a sign of the mercy of God is that he doesn't allow matter to be created or destroyed allowing us a maneuverable world with consistant laws. That there is balance and harmoney, seen in many equations - equal opposite reaction - witnessing a calf being chased by a lion and when we can not root for one or the other, we can see the natural systems that are in harmoney. the story from Jesus that if we trusted like the birds, we'd go out hungry and come home fed - this sort of trust has religious roots, in the muslim tradition it's believed that our sustinance and lifespan are written, so we must enact to create the occasion for rizk to come, like mary under the date tree, she was asked to shake the tree and the dates fell for her. yet there is so much ambition and struggle and competition. What would happen if these beliefs, a little further afield from the fact that existance exists and that much of nature is in harmony, a type of knowledge that we can know without any need for external teachers, direct knowledge. VS the knowledge in the spiritual traditions, the promise of God that no one's money was ever decreased from giving charity. If people truly believed this, would there be any poverty? \\n4. In the idea of the time sausage I was imagining that each 3d frame has a lived depth to it, perhaps as long as our short term memory, where we would be \\\"Trapped\\\" in and live forever, experiencing the consequence of the decisions. If we betray ourselves and hurt someone for a long term gain, that sense of wrongness, the darkness, that lives forever in a snapshot in the time sausage. The idea of patience and gratitude transforms even a necessarily painful moment (death of a loved one, painful medical treatments) into a place of blessings to reside within that snapshot forever, proud of how you are responding.\\n5. scientific rigor and spiritual openness are related, the idea of a scientist curiously and openly attempting to see and understand brings awe, wonder, curoisity, etc. The science directed by intentionality seeking to make use of the operations of the natural world for the benefit of the inventor is different, blinded, and I believe directs science toward a world of less awe and more mechanisation and harm. For instance the invention of the Fritz Haber process transforms nitrogen from the air into fertilizer today, it was first invented to be able to build bombs for the German war machine. And now that abundance of nitrogen led to feeding many millionso f people - yet the food is not as nutritious and how many diseases of malnutrition do we have? What about the dead land and the dead zone in the gulf of mexico from nitrogen based fertilizer run off. Bringing our innovation and creativity in line with our sense of oneness with all things, the idea of the natural direct knowledge we see and know about the harmoney and balance of the world, which is not foriegn to us, we can think then as we learn and understand more about how it works also how best to participate. And when we participate we can always review, is this, or is this not, following The Way, is it encouraging harmoney and balance, is it beautiful?\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, let's review the essay structure and all the text I have provided, and without changing my text much let's rearrange my ideas in my own language to present a compelling essay.

The Way comes from Toaism and i choose to refer to it to describe a natural philosophy that scientists might be able to more easily resonate with VS a God inspired religion like Islam. The Way can be known when the knowing self moves into the action, choiceless action called wu wei - a sense of doing without doing, this is perhaps the telltale sign of being on the path. In the muslim tradition it says that God becomes the eyes with which you see, the ears with which you hear, and the hands by which you act\\n2. Curiosity driven knowledge opens the doors of knowledge that include direct observation, questions about meaning, life, death, and unifies because curiosity is a radiating type of intellectual force. Utility driven knowledge has a direction, a sense of importance, a hunger for acheivement of a solution and a narrowing of vision vs the radiating nature of curiosity. This causes one to ignore the idea of balance and harmoney, which comes perhaps outside the vantage point of a narrowed vision. The discovery of the double helix can be seen as a curisoty driven acheivement, looking, wondering, being open to the gift of discovery. i believe this is also an important element, the discovery of penecilin, an accident, a gift, and acknowledged as such by pasteur by his rejection for patent rights. This demonstrates the openness and acceptance of knowledge and insight through wonder and curiosity can influence those who recieve it. It's all a gift, why not give and share of its benefit.\\n3. I was once in a refugee camp in Syria and I was given the most delicious meal I had in months, the desire to be generous to guests, the hospitality culture, is similar to the gift culture. The (non-intellectuated) thought that i have recieved so I will give. It's critical that the gift doesn't become a transaction, this is related to the disindividuating practices, not that I personally will recieve a gift when I visit someone else, the fact is that as a giver i created this reality of the gift world that is possible. One day it might be me, perhaps it is \\\"me\\\" given a slighty vaster interpretation of the world. These values enacted create a social reality that matches the knowable reality by direct observation. The ultimate gift is the gift of existance which we didn't do anything for and from which all other gifts derive. To see the world as a constant paying it forward of the ultimate gift, transferring, shifting, never being consumed or reduced is a way to begin to trust. Perhaps I go hungry, yet the beauty of a world which exists generously with gifts and offerings and sharing and loving others as ones self - perhaps because the unitary conciousness sees this as true. As true once values are lived, upheld, we do our part in creating a more aligned social reality that in a small way, praises the ultimate reality. \\n4. A day thath starts with intention and ends with reviewing allows us to constantly stay in tune. Like a tuning fork near another one, we can listen for the resonances and move. The 99 names, and infinitely many more, are in a dyanmic dance everywhere within and without us. Our role can be to align to that, and then slowly slowly watch our movements come into harmony with that which is the origin of harmony. We must constantly review, because we forget, our actions and to see if we align with our intentions. Intentions can become plans, and in the days between the intention and the arrival, we are in a state of alignment and becoming.\\n5. I remember one day I was holding my 6 month old baby and the sun came streaming in through the window and he was holding my finger. The moment of such happiness and worry for his future, the war in palestine raging, the sense of care and love and wonder and the little warm hand on my finger filled me with such a sense of everything that I remember crying and thinking, this is enough for a life to experience this one moment. All the difficulty, the joy, the love, the travel, the learning, the writing, this one moment is enough for life to be worth having lived. \\nYes, now that these are addressed you can continue, remember use my language as closely as possible to write the essay, cut/paste elements.

The thought arose clearly: this one moment is enough for a life to be worth having lived. All the difficulty, the joy, the learning, the travel, the writing - this single moment of direct knowing contained everything. This is what The Way feels like - when the knowing self moves into action, a sense of doing without doing, what the Taoists call wu wei.\\n\\n**Two Ways of Knowing: The Modern Crisis**\\n\\nThe sense of love and joy when I'm with my baby, or the amazement when seeing dolphins in the ocean - isn't interpreted. Somehow it's clear, yet if people asked, I couldn't defend it. In our modern world, this makes these ways of knowing lesser than the \\\"more correct\\\" answers about evolutionary adaptation or survival mechanisms in a hostile world. We face a crisis of knowledge where our most meaningful experiences are considered the least valid, where trust in direct experience has been replaced by fear and the need for constant interpretation.\\n\\nConsider how this plays out in the history of human understanding. For centuries, astronomers observed the peculiar motion of planets in the night sky - sometimes appearing to move backward in their journey across the heavens. This \\\"retrograde motion\\\" demanded explanation. The transmitted knowledge that Earth was the center of the universe, around which all celestial bodies must orbit, forced scholars to create increasingly complex mathematical models. They added circles within circles, epicycles upon epicycles, performing intellectual gymnastics to preserve their fundamental assumption. It wasn't until we allowed ourselves to see differently - to consider that perhaps we weren't the center - that a simpler, more elegant truth emerged. The planets' apparent backward motion was simply the natural result of observing them from our own moving platform as we all orbit the sun.\\n\\n**Time, Trust, and Knowledge**\\n\\nThis pattern of holding onto transmitted knowledge at the expense of direct observation repeats throughout history and within our own lives. How can we possibly know what it feels like to live in a society which builds these sorts of minds? Do they qualitatively have different architecture and structure? Could they be unknowable and could it be impossible to gain access to these ways of being/seeing without being raised in an entire society with a different paradigm?\\n\\nThe question of how we know extends into how we experience time itself. Clock time implies dollars and cents - an exchange of now for an enjoyment later, as opposed to a lived experience of now where our morality can show up. There's a disconnection between actions and morality when living on clock time versus being in the now, witnessing our moral actions. The idea of a traitor going against their own nation in exchange for money requires mental time travel - the blessed financial future in exchange for the non-existent now where we don't live with ourselves doing the crime.\\n\\nA revolutionary shift in consciousness might be close - one that parallels the Copernican revolution in astronomy. Once accepted, perhaps many things will be renewed and reinterpreted without the mental gymnastics that allow us to say \\\"I'm just doing my job\\\" while we see that perhaps the job shouldn't exist at all. This shift involves decentering the self and recognizing consciousness as a gift we partake in rather than possess. It's about moving from fear-based interpretation to trust-based direct knowing, recognizing the natural harmony and balance that exists when we align ourselves with The Way.\\n\\n[Would you like me to continue with the next sections? This version develops the retrograde motion example more fully and connects it more clearly to the themes of direct knowing versus transmitted knowledge, while also introducing the temporal aspect that becomes crucial in later sections.]\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"Yes, continue with the next two sections\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"assistant\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"**Trust, Gift, and The Natural Way**\\n\\nI was once in a refugee camp in Syria where I was given the most delicious meal I had in months. The desire to be generous to guests, the hospitality culture, reveals something fundamental about trust and gift-giving. The (non-intellectuated) thought that \\\"I have received so I will give\\\" creates a different kind of social reality. It's critical that the gift doesn't become a transaction - this is related to the disindividuating practices. It's not that I personally will receive a gift when I visit someone else; the fact is that as a giver, I created this reality of the gift world that is possible. One day it might be me, perhaps it is \\\"me\\\" given a slightly vaster interpretation of the world.\\n\\nHaving a sense of presence and trust can shift us from hoarding to relationship. If we can move into trust-based economies, knowing we are deeply integrated into social webs rather than isolated and protected by a moat of financial reserves - money for housing, money for food, money for medical care, money to distract us when we realize we're lonely - we might measure wealth differently. Rather than measuring what we have in our bank (integral), we can measure how much money comes in/out (derivative), indicating our role in the dynamics around us.\\n\\nThese values enacted create a social reality that matches the knowable reality by direct observation. The ultimate gift is the gift of existence which we didn't do anything for and from which all other gifts derive. To see the world as a constant paying it forward of the ultimate gift, transferring, shifting, never being consumed or reduced is a way to begin to trust. Perhaps I go hungry, yet the beauty of a world which exists generously with gifts and offerings and sharing and loving others as oneself - perhaps because the unitary consciousness sees this as true.\\n\\n**Science, Wonder, and The Path Forward**\\n\\nScientific rigor and spiritual openness are deeply related. The idea of a scientist curiously and openly attempting to see and understand brings awe, wonder, curiosity. But science directed by intentionality seeking to make use of the operations of the natural world for the benefit of the inventor is different, blinded, and I believe directs science toward a world of less awe and more mechanization and harm.\\n\\nConsider the Fritz Haber process, which transforms nitrogen from the air into fertilizer. It was first invented to build bombs for the German war machine. Today, that abundance of nitrogen has led to feeding millions of people - yet the food is not as nutritious, and how many diseases of malnutrition do we have? What about the dead land and the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico from nitrogen-based fertilizer runoff? Contrast this with the discovery of penicillin - an accident, a gift, acknowledged as such by Pasteur through his rejection of patent rights. This demonstrates how openness and acceptance of knowledge through wonder and curiosity can influence those who receive it. It's all a gift, why not give and share of its benefit?\\n\\nBringing our innovation and creativity in line with our sense of oneness with all things requires constant review. In the Muslim tradition, this is called muraja3a (reviewing) and muhasaba (taking ourselves to account). A day that starts with intention and ends with reviewing allows us to constantly stay in tune. Like a tuning fork near another one, we can listen for the resonances and move. The 99 names, and infinitely many more, are in a dynamic dance everywhere within and without us. Our role can be to align to that, and then slowly, slowly watch our movements come into harmony with that which is the origin of harmony.\\n\\nWhen we participate in discovery and innovation, we can always review: is this, or is this not, following The Way? Is it encouraging harmony and balance? Is it beautiful? The natural direct knowledge we see and know about the harmony and balance of the world is not foreign to us. As we learn and understand more about how it works, we can also learn how best to participate.\\n\\n[Would you like me to write the conclusion?

As we learn and understand more about how it works, we can also learn how best to participate.\\n\\nWould you like me to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this version, or would you prefer to point out areas that need improvement first?\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"Time Trust and the architecture of mind seems like it's short and confusing and needs some deepening to make a better argument.

Clock time is one where the tick tocking of a clock determines life, vs one where one might be more connected to natural rythems and the implications it has on integrating one into a dynamic with the world. Seeing the sun setting, knowing the work day is done vs watching a clock slide to 5pm and jumping for joy. The entrainment we get into with clocks dictating our days is harsh and sharp vs the gradual feeling of waking up groggy at dawn and booting up over the course of an hour as the sun slowly stars warming the earth. The transitions, the presence, the connection with the solarsystem and universe as we smell the morning full of dew, or connecting with the inner cosmos, as some women do with their menstrual cycles. As we connect more to the cycles of life, harvest seasons, planting seasons, resting seasons, acting seasons, I believe we get into more harmony and less tick tock investment return i paid x for this and it's been 12 months and i expect a 5 percent annual return. VS planting, praying, abundance, sharing. I believe there is. a relationship between time and presence and gifts and abundance and clock time and forethought/planning/projection and earning and extracting. \\\"Getting the most \\\"bang\\\" from your buck\\\" or earning more per hour/day - leverage, hoarding because hoarding and time leads to growth. VS alterantive economics where hoarding leads to grain spoilage, the inversion of interest and making money on money, holding grain leads to reduction and encourages spending. \\n2. architecures of mind - people who have complete faith in the unseen Absolute. There's a story I remember of a sheikh who was in a car accident where the driver was killed and the person in the backseat jumps out of the car and rushes to the window where the sheikh was sitting, blood dripping from his face and he desperately asks if he's OK, so much worry. The sheikh simply says \\\"I am ok, god be praised, I have set my intention and prayed my istikhara prayer, requesting permission and blessings for this car journey\\\" - the idea that someone can be in an urgent situation like this and remain calm because of a foundational belief that they are in the care of a most Merciful Lord makes me wonder what it would be like to inhabit a mind like that. makes me wonder what the world would be like if we had 1% of the population with eyes that see the world like that. That sort of trust creates a new ground of being that connects us beyond time and presence to the ultimate and in that grounding we can pour forth in this world all our gifts without fear or loss.\\n3. The time sausage is a metephor, like the many snapshots of a cartoon drawn on paper, except in 3d, to help us imagine our lives in the grand scheme of the universe. The time sausage has a thin pointy bit at one end and then expands, showcasing the bigbang creating space/time and each slide of this time sausage is a moment from the very beginning till now. Your life would start as a minuscule few cells, moving around in a tiny sphere stretched through time towards a period where all your composite molecules will once again be scattered in an earth-shaped orb. In this view watching outside time and space one can imagine that each snapshot also must have within it conciousness and experience. Presence to me feels like it can be expanded about 3/4 seconds of existence. Perhaps as shakespear says, there's nothing good or bad and that thinking makes it so - we can imagine that the duration of a ruminative thought of self dislike can be the sense / being / snapshot for your conciousness in that frame in the time sausage forever. There's no going back. Otherwise the sene of self acceptance / like, trust in yourself being as beautiful as you can be, given the singular nature of the time sausage and all the other elements within it - that's a good place to live \\\"forever\\\" in a sense. \\n4. Making a plan and sticking to it is one of the critical success factors no matter the initial feedback we might have. One of the worst ways to lose money is jumping into the stock market greedily seeing the price go up and then when the correction inevitably comes selling in terror as everythign tumbles - only to watch as the stock market performs stable and smoothly in a multi-year perspective. Patience and planning, vs responding with greed and fear can be seen easily in markets as they are a sort of mirror to the feeling of the market.\\n5. The Gify By Lewis Hyde documents gift cultures, the idea that art can be a gift and maybe is a gift of connection. \\n6. journaling intentions in the morning review at night is simple enough\\n7. historians debate for ages why zheng He had ships with 28,000 sailors and visited 30 countries yet didn't colonize a single one, similarly there's The Needham Puzzle which asks why didn't China develop science and industrialize when it had the means to. Other historians question why the ottoman empire didn't industrialize, seeming to take as a given that western society's developmental direction is progress and that they \\\"should\\\" have. the outcomes might not have been politically adventageous as these countries were dominated by europeans militarilly. There are some interesting stories of people from ottoman empire being asked about european wealth, big buildings, wide streets, yet seeming not to be excited by this view of glamorous progress. A society can be judged by how it treats its weak, or perhaps, we can judge a society by how much anti-depressants they prescribe. (i want to find/remember this story about the sheikh looking at the western world and being unfazed) \\n8. transmitted knowledge can be seen as things we learn from others, including science, and transmitted elements from religious doctrines. derived knowledge takes a mind and a world and contemplation. The book Hayy Ibn Yaqzan follows the story of someoen on a deserted island who in their primordeal knowledge seeking and enaction essentially ends up practicing the muslim faith, an ancient story. \\n9) The trust that people have create a new ground on which to stand, especially without fear of hunger or death it creates a different way to interact. Today we want smart contracts that are incorruptable, what if our souls were, what if there were people in the world where dishonor and going against their word/trust would be worse than death? It seems to create a platform from which we can connect/exchange that is beautiful rather than mechanical and efficient. I believe a perfect system where our souls are not exposed to the reality of ethical action, and the friction that choosing the Good provides, is infact the oposite of a perfect system. It's preventing the most beautiful parts of us from growing, causing atrophy in the muscles of perception and enaction of The Good - leading to smooth and slippery exchange of \\\"Goods and services\\\" except are they goods if the bodies they provide nutrition to are empty of beauty? are they really serving us if the will that directs those services has not been refined through repeated interaction with ethical training and action?\\n10) if you follow the way you will not be wondering if you are following the way. there is ... no way.

Could you share more about the relationship between Flow states and ethical action? How does being in Flow relate to \\\"following The Way\\\"?\\n\\nWould you like to address any of these questions before I proceed with the complete rewrite?\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"1. you can come up with one\\n2. friction in ethical development - the idea is that knowing what is beautiful and Good is one thing, it fills the heart with song. I want to give time to visit a sick person, then there's the effort of going and clearing the snow off the car and driving to the hospital buying flowers and spending time with the person. That process is effortful, there's friction there. You choose to become the goodness that you imagined. In the light of oneness, the idea that this friction sands down the self absorbed, individuated part of you that would rather want for itself, coffee from that fancy shop for me rather than flowers for that person, sleep in my warm bed rather than scraping snow off the car. The self absorbed self is shrunk everytime we prioritize beauty and goodness, the process of doing this enacts beauty and goodness and makes it a reality in the world. This can relate to the ethical idea of imagining acting in the world and doing things as if you could be reborn tomorrow and be anyone on the planet. The person working at the flower shop, the person in the fields growing the flowers, perhaps the flower and the soil itself. In this worldview when we want to act in a way that's beautiful, we take into consideration all levels of ebauty, which is why harmony and balance must be preserved. If we are to be a chicken to be slaughtered, how would we raise them? How would we bring the knife down? I do not believe we'd do it as we do it here. The choice to become a beautifying agent on this planet requires us to think systematically and holistically and to align with the balance. \\n3. Empty bodies - I mean that they are living for an imaginary self, self absorbed and becoming something despised and despisable. No one likes a narcessist, yet our culture fetishizes the self, quench your thirst, do what you love, you only live once YOLO - etc. The issue is this leads to a person becoming valuless because they are not directed towards becoming. athing of value, a thing they can be proud of, in a humble way, proud and honored to be allowed and given the willingness and strength of will to enact beauty, forthemselves and othres. It's like a fire, warms those and brings light to all and doesn't forget itself. \\n4. alternative metrics - the book giving up the Gun shows how Japan for hundreds of years, after becoming world experts, decided to stop making guns and muskets - because they saw the disgrace in how someone with no training, no honing of the self, could shoot and kill a samurai with decades of discipline and a protective warrior ethic. Who do we empower with our technologies if our selves are not refined? Do we want to give the power of the Gods to those who don't discipline themselves to earn it? Where do we learn to be appropriate weilders of the power that technology has unlocked for all of us. When college dropouts can build technologies that transform the world before they have learned how to mourn the loss of their parents, or raise a toddler with patience and love. The metrics might be the problem, coming up with a measure takes away from the quality of creating the situation of beauty. For instance if we measure number of impovrished people, we are measuring a number instead of knowing the person. The shift towards knowing that we are here to know the whole and see the consequences of our actions towards Godly traits of harmony, balance, beauty, justice, etc and to respond appropriately in our lives and to teach this, and build environments where this is the goal and ultimate path in life, the purificaiton of the self till only beauty spills forth. I believe success should be in every step for a king, president and shop owner. Success is in right action at the right time derived from right seeing. These, in aggregate, creates a more beautiful world, although it doesn't matter. For instance there's a story of a child on a beach throwing star fish back into the water one at a time., there are hundreds of starfish. The father asks, you know you it doesn't matter, you can't save them all, and the boy responds, it matters to this one - he says as he throws it into the ocean. The idea is that it doesn't just matter to the starfish, it matters to the boy. The boy has created the reality of mercy on earth where indifference is the \\\"rational\\\" response. The shift. inthinking is to focus on our purification and action and creating situations for this rather than thinking about systems and metrics only to intervene strategically. The most strategic thing to do is to make real Goodness and beauty. This makes it... real. I can't overemphasize this - there are some things we cannot control, aging, for instance, happens. Perhaps you don't think that's necessarily so, liek Aubrey De Gray, fine. How about accidents. Ok, now we create systems of insurnace to handle this in an impersonal way, depriving neighbors, sisters, brothers and friends to come to one's help. Or for doctors to volunteer their efforts. For those who can to do when they can. \\n5. flow states don't necessarily lead to ethical actions, yet with appropriate intentionality, and a trust and a letting go it might be possible to be in a flow state and to exist it when your self desirous self, your self abosrbed self starts talking and demanding and ruminating \"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"assistant\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"text\",\n                    \"text\": \"This additional content is incredibly rich and adds crucial depth, particularly around:\\n1.

In that moment, tears welled up - a complex mixture of joy, worry about his future with wars raging in Palestine, wonder, and love.

All the difficulty, the joy, the learning, the travel, the writing - this single moment of direct knowing contained everything.

The sheikh simply says \\\"I am ok, God be praised, I have set my intention and prayed my istikhara prayer, requesting permission and blessings for this car journey.\\\" The idea that someone can be in an urgent situation like this and remain calm because of a foundational belief that they are in the care of a most Merciful Lord makes me wonder what it would be like to inhabit a mind like that.

The process of doing this enacts beauty and goodness and makes it a reality in the world.\\n\\nI was once in a refugee camp in Syria where I was given the most delicious meal I had in months. The desire to be generous to guests, the hospitality culture, reveals something fundamental about trust and gift-giving. The (non-intellectuated) thought that \\\"I have received so I will give\\\" creates a different kind of social reality. It's critical that the gift doesn't become a transaction - this is related to the disindividuating practices.\\n\\n**Technology, Power, and Worthiness**\\n\\nConsider Japan's decision, documented in the book \\\"Giving up the Gun,\\\" where after becoming world experts, they chose to stop making guns and muskets. They saw the disgrace in how someone with no training, no honing of the self, could shoot and kill a samurai with decades of discipline and a protective warrior ethic.

The metrics might be the problem - coming up with a measure takes away from the quality of creating the situation of beauty. For instance, if we measure number of impoverished people, we are measuring a number instead of knowing the person.\\n\\n**Creating Reality Through Action**\\n\\nThere's a story of a child on a beach throwing starfish back into the water one at a time. There are hundreds of starfish. The father asks, \\\"You know it doesn't matter, you can't save them all,\\\" and the boy responds, \\\"It matters to this one\\\" as he throws it into the ocean.

The most strategic thing to do is to make real Goodness and beauty. This makes it... real.\\n\\n**The Way of No Way**\\n\\nIf you follow the way you will not be wondering if you are following the way. There is... no way. Think of the state of Flow from Csikszentmihalyi - the capacity at wondering if you're there is occupied with engagement. Yet flow states don't necessarily lead to ethical actions. With appropriate intentionality, and trust and letting go, it might be possible to be in a flow state and to exist it when your self-desirous self, your self-absorbed self starts talking and demanding and ruminating.\\n\\nThe ultimate gift is the gift of existence which we didn't do anything for and from which all other gifts derive. To see the world as a constant paying it forward of the ultimate gift, transferring, shifting, never being consumed or reduced is a way to begin to trust. Perhaps I go hungry, yet the beauty of a world which exists generously with gifts and offerings and sharing and loving others as oneself - perhaps because the unitary consciousness sees this as true.\\n\\nSuccess should be in every step for a king, president and shop owner. Success is in right action at the right time derived from right seeing. These, in aggregate, create a more beautiful world, although it doesn't matter. What matters is that we become beautiful in trying, that we make real the possibility of beauty and trust in a world increasingly structured around fear and extraction. The Way is not a path to follow but a reality to create, moment by moment, choice by choice, in the eternal now where all possibility resides.\\n\\n[Would you like me to review this for areas that need strengthening or clarification?]\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n)\nprint(message.content)"

The sheikh simply says \"I am ok, God be praised, I have set my intention and prayed my istikhara prayer, requesting permission and blessings for this car journey.\" The idea that someone can be in an urgent situation like this and remain calm because of a foundational belief that they are in the care of a most Merciful Lord makes me wonder what it would be like to inhabit a mind like that.

The idea is that it doesn't just matter to the starfish, it matters to the boy. The boy has created the reality of mercy on earth where indifference is the \"rational\" response.\n\nSuccess is in right action at the right time derived from right seeing. These, in aggregate, create a more beautiful world, although it doesn't matter.

            "extracted_content": "INSPIRE & NAVIGATE\nAligned Pedagogically Sound Frameworks\n  For Transformational Learning\nIntroduction - How to Learn What You Don’t Know Without A Teacher\nLearning how to learn is a critical skill in an era of change. To do this, we must know ourselves, our abilities, our limits and finally we must know where we want to go and have some idea how to get there. This is the crux of the problem, in much of the world education is lackluster, and mentorship is lacking, and having a sense of where to go next is next to impossible without exposure and support. We believe generative AI can solve this problem, or make it worse.\n\nFor nearly a decade I’ve been building systems to help people learn about knowledge landscapes through educational assessments and offering learning activities based on results. While this is marginally better than giving someone access to wikipedia and suggestions they “google it” - it’s missing a crucial element. A database model of education doesn’t have the ability to support goal reflection and articulation, doesn’t know your blindspots, can’t explain things walking backward from where you want to go to your current level of knowledge. These, and many others, are new learning levers that Large Language Models now make possible.\n\nLLMs can transform education along the same vector previous technologies have, making it more accessable, personalized and relational. In the Middle Ages, a prince may have had a tutor, in the Industrial Era the printing press made books accessible to those with disposable income, later cultural innovations like the Public Library brought access to more people, the internet brought searchability with database queries, Wikipedia, Brilliant and youtube brought multi-modal and social learning to our pockets. LLMs can be the next step. Right now the internet is full of knowledge waiting to become relevant, except the person who needs it best might not know what to search for and no database will help. We need conversation and adaptive learning directionality, things LLMs can bring to the table.\nThe Ethics of LLMs and Agency - To have or to be\nOn top of the ethical problems of bias in the data sets used for training, there are other biases baked in during the instruction fine tuning moment and during the user scoring and feedback loops. What is a good response from an LLM? \nWe’ve hit a the language of normativity, what’s a good prompt, and this is where designers of systems resort to “whatever people want” - and often use session based user testing (have you ever selected one of two chatGPT prompt responses?) to feedback “good response” through the training set and into system. \nThat sounds like a reasonable approach, except let’s take the analogy of using an escalator, using it once might be a thrill, especially if it’s your first time. Yet if it replaces taking the stairs at home and those 4 flights of stairs were a large part of your daily exercise as you go up and down multiple times a day, you might find that you rue the day you ever started taking the escalator.\nSo is an escalator good or bad? \nLet’s conduct a trial (June 2024) with the LLM on the top of the leaderboards, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Prompt: “Please write a letter to my grieving mother… I just lost my dad, she just lost her husband.” Response: “Dear Mom, I hope this letter finds you in a moment of peace… [one page of cringeworthy content] …I'm here for you, Mom. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. We'll get through this together, one day at a time.” \nWill “we” - using my own pronouns to write a letter on my behalf to my mom for my dad, who thankfully is very much still alive, feels so weird to me. \nI think this is related to the idea of having, vs being. I have my response, I can use it to send to my mother and get the task out of the way. Or I can engage with the soul searching needed to say what is truely mine to say in this moment, something that might have never been said before, perhaps, something that would be new to the collective embedding space. Something that would touch my mothers heart, and give me a sense of grief soaked contentedness.\n\nThe Reality of Muses\nIt was missing what the muses would bring to me, and only me, in this moment - sure it can help us write, yet I believe it should have asked first for input. You can blame it on the prompt, or we can reflect on the user feedback mechanisms, the instruction fine tuning environment and build a better prompt reciever than a prompt writer. What are the qualities of a good prompt? What makes an LLM respond in ways that make it more like an escalator than a flight of stairs, and how do we build a system that’s as fun to ride as an escalator, yet as supportive for health and who we want to be as stairs.\nWhat the Telos\nIt seems that the LLM is able to get up to the understanding area from the trillions of datapoints entered as it’s training set, yet there is a moment of choice that connects to the steerability of the LLMs, the agency of a learner, the layer of wisdom where potentially we must guide a learner towards, bringing the information, explaining the knowledge, and bringing someone to the moment of their choosing. \n\nSoon LLMs will enter the pockets of 80% of the world’s population when they are integrated with our smart phones. They can either continue to be designed and marketed towards becoming your “assisstant” or they can be designed and marketed towards becoming your assistant and coach. They can help you do. \n\nOr they can help you do things you never thought possible.\n\nWe have a choice.\n\nThe Problem Today: People Don’t Know What They Are Talking To\nAs educators at Bloom.pm, it has been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, which is how they are marketed. “GPT, make me a sandwich!”.  Through our interactions with our students and many hundreds of hours of LLM use we came to the conclusion that to use LLMs effectively we must how LLMs work, how Learning works and to map between learning needs and the new affordances LLMs have made architecturally, and technically to interface with a large chunk of what is known to humanity today. \n\nWe are approaching this goal, t, practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nLearning is goal oriented behavior and in this paper we will describe emerging trends in research that demonstrates that LLMs are able to identify your goals without your explicitly stating them. Using this goal representing in the language of LLMs as an embedding in a vector space we can have  geometric representation of our goals, beliefs, emotions and knowledge allowing us to use prompting like a compass to walk in into the dark spaces of our knowledge towards our goals. Learning happens in a loop where acting creates new knowledge, changing the system again, and potentially updating the goal, and therefore the location and therefore the new-new thing we need to learn. \n\nSome people say that a datapoint merges with others to become information, information merges to become knowledge and knowledge can become wisdom - which I’d argue is knowledge updated after enactment. You are informed by knowledge and act upon it, and through that transform yourself create new knowledge, and gain in wisdom. \nWe believe that due to the biomimetic approaches computer scientists have taken to develop AI/LLMs there are leverageable structures within LLMs to support our learning journey. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \n\nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December after hundreds of hours of GPT use the following framework has been developed. Finding first the principles that led to better results with Large Language Models (LLMs) and then later formalized through the lense of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into transformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how LLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by these two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to migration, economic impoverishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of their understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to develop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nBalaji Srinivasan, author of the Network State, describes “dark talent” - the idea that through networking we can find extreme talant anywhere then support and network them into a powerful State beyond borders. This idea superficially sounds possible, yet upon further consideration good ideas do not come simply from numbers of brains alone. Exposure is critical. While there are many definitions for intelligence, the one that appeals to me most is the one proposed by Douglass Hofsteader in his book Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire as the ability to abstract and generalize from specific instances into concepts that become manipulable in an uninterpreted way. For instance the moment you hear something it’s either a noise or a sound, a sound you can say has an isness - an implication, hooked into an idea, a noise is something that must be interpreted. That immediate translation from auditory input into categorization likely develops like our other senses, and it’s for this reason I propose we may be more likely homo-sensorious than homo-sapiens, since thinking is seeing. The process of taking sensory input, conceptual input and deriving a new “one of those” is a process humanity does individually and collectively. Youth are often at the forefront, as GenZ slang demonstrates copious examples. \nLet’s talk about being “Based” - which originated as a way to describe someone who was “freebasing” drugs, which itself is a created concept based on the idea of acids and bases, transforming amines, usually basic, into their neutral counterparts to alter their consumption methods and impacts. Now, for GenZ, being based simply means “not caring” - and it’s very likely the majority of people using the word have no understanding of the chemical processes underpinning the origin of the word. And most chemists likely do not know that the word, base, comes from the greek pedestal due to it bening the structure upon which an acid rests upon when making a salt (The Origin of the Term “Base” by William B. Jense 10.1021/ed083p1130). \n\nWhy did we take this long detour into understanding the origins of ideas? It’s to make it clear that there is more than superficial language connecting human intelligence with machine intelligence, and that by exposing how a machine learns to a human, we can transfer some of the millions of dollars and effort spent running millions of words across the attention mechanisms of LLMs to the most marginalized learners on the planet. Making it more likely that they could be one of the “dark talents” that will come up with the idea that will deeply and positively impact their communities and our world. The network state should seek true diversity for it to make true on its promise, otherwise we will have a silicon valley state with Berlin, Beijing, Paris, Silicon Valley, New York, Porto, Dubai, Bangalore and other cities like these being over-represented, and not due to their population count. \nTo increase the possible surface area of ideas crossing minds that are able to merge and encompass I believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of pre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of 2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nWhile we’re waiting for openAI and Anthropic to integrate machine-human transfer learning into the core of their offering, we have options:\nSupport the development of the ways of being that inspire prompting along the framework described below. \nTechnological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of improvements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer. \nDeveloping customized system prompts that align with the person that will maneuver the LLM to being more transfer and transformational in its dialog. \n\nThese two ideas:\nTransfer and transformation hint at what I believe to be the key insight underneath much of this argument, that we can learn best when we learn in symbiosis with a machine that learns in similar ways (concept clustering). \nSalience is the sense that things are meaningful and make sense, when you write a poem referring to your infant child as the light of your life, she doesn’t become photons, yet you may sense the rightness of this analogy. When taking certain entheogens one might start reducing their critical thinking allowing them to make analogies that are further off from reality. This lamppost reminds me of my highschool history teacher’s handwriting - perhaps. Yet how helpful is it for them, let alone others? Only God(swt) has the highest analogy, truely being able to see the oneness of everything - to hold that in total comprehension. We are reduced to analogies that are “useful” - yet the true geniuses are those that continue to expand and encompass till they are able to hold more things in the light of oneness. This is the process of meta-cognition. The ability to dive into the uniqueness yet zoom out into the unity at will. This in/out process is what enables the building of patterns across truely related concepts that those inside the concept space might not be able to see. \nThis is how pattern recognition is possible. A developer at a certain level of mental complexity may think their job is to provide code that achieves a goal - contrast this to a CEO making a decision where they may need to be able to see the interrelationships between being a father, a ceo, the company in the context of the economy, the economy in the context of global cultural shifts against capitalism, the international climate and how it relates to a decision between stainless steel and aluminum.\nThis level of thinking is more related to a why than a how. \nMachines are more and more able to take over the how, and normally mental complexity and human transformation that leads to it arises after many years of “one of those”ing many situations, building experience throughout life. Is it possible to develop and transform and grow in the true sorts of comprehension that allow someone to see and know the why behind things, the thing that touches the indeterminate gut intuition, the sense of rightness, the value that one knows through their emotions, the feeling of beauty that arises when the right thing emerges. \nThis is a “zone of genius” - this is everything one knows and an element of the ineffable, what exactly is a beautiful idea? How does one make a decision at high levels of abstraction? I believe that it’s similar to the physicist who chooses the more beautiful equation and finds this “trust” is rewarded. Or as G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” Why?\nWhile one may dive into controversial territory speaking of God or Truth. I believe we can stay within the realm of the philosophical and logical. We see that salience is possible to artificially enhance, that moment when someone on a psychoactive substance senses they just found the meaning of everything and they write it down only later to find it’s something like “the stars are beautiful, and I am a star” or some other phrase that doesn’t quite pack the same punch. This is related to the difference between a two dimensional matrix True and false and permanent and transitory. There are moments in our lives when we are able to go a level above our mental complexity and we glimpse the world from above, like a flatlander in 2 dimensions being pulled into the third dimension and can finally understand the topology of 2 dimensional shapes, that all the differences he sees in triangles and squares and octogons, that really, in a sense that is hard to build when you live in 2, they’re all the same, a single line encompassing a space - all essentially circles. \nTo gain an intuitive understanding of the sort of space of inspiration needed to build new knowledge, let’s study this picture carefully:\nWhat does it look like it represents? \nImagine you produced this image through this process:\n\nTry to determine the structure of the material in the place of the green shape in the image above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Would you have guessed a corkscrew?\n\nWe now know what DNA looks like, I can only imagine the AHA moment Rosalind Franklin had when she made the connection between all the data. I also wonder if she also decided to use the frame of a twisted strand because it was beautiful. If only she was alive today to ask.\n\nThis realization that we find throught science and mathematics, that beauty is a trustworthy guide may have evolutionary origins, although there is no reason that of all the ways the world could have worked that it should be this way.\n\nI believe that a good human life is connected to this source of knowledge, the source where we know beauty and align ourselves and our actions with it. It’s not to become a bootcamp developer or whatever is the current trend in education. The how will be automated, craft remains since craft remains tied to purpose and beauty.\n\nOk, now let’s connect this dialog with learning and transformation using LLMs: \nNow, we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting.\n\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse), and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions. \n"

These, in aggregate, create a more beautiful world, although it doesn't matter. What matters is that we become beautiful in trying, that we make real the possibility of beauty and trust in a world increasingly structured around fear and extraction. The ultimate gift is the gift of existence which we didn't do anything for and from which all other gifts derive. To see the world as a constant paying it forward of the ultimate gift, transferring, shifting, never being consumed or reduced is a way to begin to trust. Perhaps I go hungry, yet the beauty of a world which exists generously with gifts and offerings and sharing and loving others as oneself - perhaps because the unitary consciousness sees this as true.\n\nWould you like me to revise any sections or strengthen particular transitions?",

The idea is that it doesn't just matter to the starfish, it matters to the boy. The boy has created the reality of mercy on earth where indifference is the \"rational\" response.\n\n**The Zone of Genius and Authentic Contribution**\n\nThis is a \"zone of genius\" - this is everything one knows and an element of the ineffable, what exactly is a beautiful idea? How does one make a decision at high levels of abstraction? I believe that it's similar to the physicist who chooses the more beautiful equation and finds this \"trust\" is rewarded. The metrics might be the problem - coming up with a measure takes away from the quality of creating the situation of beauty.\n\nSuccess is in right action at the right time derived from right seeing. These, in aggregate, create a more beautiful world, although it doesn't matter. What matters is that we become beautiful in trying, that we make real the possibility of beauty and trust in a world increasingly structured around fear and extraction. The ultimate gift is the gift of existence which we didn't do anything for and from which all other gifts derive. To see the world as a constant paying it forward of the ultimate gift, transferring, shifting, never being consumed or reduced is a way to begin to trust. Perhaps I go hungry, yet the beauty of a world which exists generously with gifts and offerings and sharing and loving others as oneself - perhaps because the unitary consciousness sees this as true.\n\nWould you like me to revise any sections or strengthen particular transitions?",

I'm the beneficiary of a trillion systems that are all coordinating, billions and millions of people, all working together to get my food on the table and there is an economy. And I think maybe the thing we're looking to do with this thought process is to simply become more in the presence and to balance our understanding with our seeing.\n\nWhen that happens, here's what I think can happen: We will notice earlier signs of fish degrading, and we won't see them as outside and other - we'll see them as part of a unified whole, a dynamic and beautiful world that is a mysterious gift, that we are here to be more a part of and responsible for and keeping a balance in rather than taking and consuming as much as we possibly can and trying to expand the amount of consumption that we can do in the limited time we have while we're alive.\n\nThis is about something beyond just having knowledge - it's about being.

Is it beautiful? The natural direct knowledge we see and know about the harmony and balance of the world is not foreign to us. As we learn and understand more about how it works, we can also learn how best to participate.
