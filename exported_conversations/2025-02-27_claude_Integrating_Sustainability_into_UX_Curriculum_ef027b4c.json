How are you doing today? \nToday, we will talk all about your customers journey with your business. We will take a look at your business from the perspective of your customers. This is an essential step right at the beginning and throughout the program as you develop your business to make sure that what you are designing fit the needs of your customers. \n\n1\n\n Reflect on CJM and why it is important. \n Map out the ideal customer journey or  “happy path” for your business.\n Identify areas of opportunity that we will use when developing your business model.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nReflect on customer journey mapping and why it is important.\nMap out the ideal customer journey or “happy path” for your business\nIdentify areas of opportunity that we will use when developing your business model\n2\n\nWHAT IS CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAPPING?\nTime\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nRecap customer journey map from Ignite\nAsk: What do you remember from the CJM?\nPotential answers could be:\nIt is mapping the users experience (UX) with your product or service\nA customer (or user) journey map is a detailed record of a customer’s experience of doing something. \nThe journey covers three parts, before, during, and after. \nThis should be put in the context of a potential customer trying to accomplish something related to your business.\nUnderstand customer emotions\nIt is the USERS EXPERIENCE with your product.\n\nAsk: Why should you understand your users journey and experience with your product? What is the benefit of that?\nPotential answers could be:\nTo know what the users go through while they try to meet their needs.\nMake our business easy and convenient for our customers.\nA customer journey map can help you build empathy towards your users as you try to experience what they go through. \nIt can also uncover insights, such as when you compare journeys between customers to find common threads or find conflicting behaviors within a customer’s journey.\nIt is a way to find new opportunities that we can implement for our business\n“A successful customer journey map will give you real insight into what your customers want and any parts of your product, brand or process that aren’t delivering.”\n3\n\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\n\n\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\n\n\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nCUSTOMER JOURNEY MAP\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nReview CJM tool\nThis is the tool that you all used during Ignite, so I hope it is familiar to you. \nAs you all mentioned earlier, you can see a big focus identifying the actual behaviors of customers. For each step a customer has a specific goal in mind. With each step emotions come up as well. Maybe they are excited, happy, or even frustrated with the process. We use this information to as a way to identify new opportunities that will make things better for our customers/user.\nWe have already done this based on your customers experience without your competitors business, now we will try and map out what their experience would be with YOUR product or service. \nWe are going to start with what is called “happy path”, which is focusing just on the steps (the highlighted part on the slide) your user/customer will take to successfully accomplish a goal (make a purchase for example). \nWe don’t know the emotions and behaviors of our customers with our product yet because we haven’t developed and tested it yet. Therefore we are only focusing on the steps. We will create the whole CJM for our business as be begin to prototype and develop more!\n\n\n\nDraw a happy path for a greengrocer shop with a goal to serve orders really fast!\nHAPPY PATH:\n10-15 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nBrainstorm: So lets do an example of this together. Lets imagine we are a green grocer shop. Our main value that differentiates ourselves from our competitors is that we serve our customers very quickly. Now lets design the happy path for our customers. Again, the happy path is the journey the customer would take to successfully complete their goal.\n\nAsk: What do you suggest? What are the steps our customers should go through to buy fresh fruit and vegetables from? \nWrite the happy path out on white board or on a Jamboard.\nPeople might answer something like this:\nListing what they need to purchase from our store\nCustomer thinks about which store to go to so they can get their groceries\nGo to our store\nEnter the store and explore it\nEvaluate the quality of produce\nPut food into your basket\nGo to check out and pay\nRequest delivery\nEtc…\n\nTrainer tips:\nMake sure to manage the board in a way to make sure the steps happen in the right order, even though people might make suggestions out of order.\nPeople might want to talk about what the business should be doing and how to run the business. Write these points on the side as ideas, but make sure to focus on the steps of the customer.\nAn entrepreneur might want to point out that the customer isn’t happy and leaves without purchasing, or maybe gets distracted by something. In that case point out that it is important to construct alternative user experiences to allow for “not happy” path journeys, but that is not our focus today. Assume they go to purchase.\n\nAsk: Why do we make this?\nWe do this to get a clear picture of your business and the journey of your customers in an obvious way. \nClarity on what is most important and what you should be doing\nFocus on Prioritize the key point of value when developing business\nSimplify and have a visual description\nWe need to start here to frame the rest of the incubator. This will be helpful when we get into prototyping as well and developing an MVP.\n\n5\n\nHAPPY PATH:\nDraw a happy path for a greengrocer shop with a goal to serve orders really fast!\nPark the car\nPick up \npre-filled packages\nPlace package on register\nPay money\nPut items in your car\nOpen the app\nAdd items to basket\nConfirm purchase request\nSelect payment method\nSelect delivery method\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\n5 minutes: Example\nAs you remember from Ignite, not all of our customers are the same. We have different personas representing groups of people with different needs. Remember my goal is to be fast and convenient. I always keep this value proposition in mind!\n\nOne happy path that I designed looks like this (show first row). This is a persona who likes to go to the store.\nThe first step here is that customers park their cars. \nIn order to make it fast, I made pre-filled packages that customers can just pick up without going around the store\nThen they go to the register and pay\nFinally they go to their car.\n\nMy second persona is someone who likes to use technology. Therefore I made an app for them. (show second happy path)\nThe journey with my app looks like:\nOpen the app\nAdd needed items to the basket\nConfirm order request\nSend payment method\nSelect delivery method (pick up in store or delivery)\nReceive fresh food to your door.\nYou can point out that there might be actions missing such as “browse items” before you add them to the cart. You want to be simple, but also comprehensive and include all the actions.\n\nRecap: \nFor each of these steps, if I see that customers will take a lot of effort to do it, I should consider changing it to something else or cutting out the step if possible.\nIn each step, I am talking about the steps my customer is taking. It is not from the perspective of the business.\nI considered my personas needs. These journeys were made based off of the user research that I did and the needs I found! \n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: “why we should do this? Why we should focus on designing the user experience with such care? (this leads us to the next slide).\nPotential answers can be: \nWe do this to get a clear picture of how your customers experience your business in a highly obvious way.\nSimplify everything in your head and have a visual description,\nWe want clarity on what is most important and what your customers end goal is (making a sale, signing up, or something else),\nWe need to start here to frame the rest of the incubator. This will be helpful when we get into prototyping as well and developing an MVP.\n\n6\n\nWHAT IS THE GOAL?\nTo deliver value and make sales \n+\n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nRecap: \nThere are both user goals and business goals that need to be considered! A great entrepreneur is able to align these 2 goals in a successful way! \nAlthough a happy path may seem very simple and mater of fact, it is essential to create a business model that you and your customers benefit from. This is all rooted in our customers needs and emotions. \nDo NOT forget about your Unique Value Proposition! We have spent so much time looking at the market and seeing where the we can really add value to our customers, we need to develop our product to meet those needs. \nAlthough you might have many great features and elements of your business, we want to focus on and prioritize the key point of value (UVP) when developing your business. Remember we are offering value to make sales (or another business goal)!\nTime and time again, when an entrepreneur interacts with investors, mentors, judges, or other business people, the most consistent feedback is that the UVP is unclear! Highlight it!\nNever forget about your UVP! \n\n\n\n7\n\nFOCUS ON THE STEPS:\n\n1. Identify the most important,      singular goal of your business.\n\n2. Start each step with an action verb.\n\n3. |Review to see which steps might cause sales to decrease.\n\n5 minutes: Lecture \n\nSo how will we create our happy paths? It is easy:\nIdentify most important, singular goal of your business. Identify your purpose. There has to be a purpose/goal at the end of the happy path. This is probably you getting paid for the key value you delivered. Each feature of your product should contribute to that one goal in some way!\n\nStart with an action verb. Every step of your happy path should be very clear and start with an action verb. What is the action that your customer does at this step to get them closer to the promise of value that your business is offering?\n\nReview to see which steps might cause sales to decrease? After you do those 2 simple steps, take a step back and review it. Are these steps simple and easy for your customer to get to the end and benefit from your product/service? How can you improve it?\n\nLet’s do an example together to clarify the steps.\n\n8\n\nTHE “HAPPY PATH”: TOURISM AGENCY\nDraw the happy path and describe the experience of your personas who are for the first time buying and using your product or service!\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nSo here is an example of a tourism agency. \nFor this business we drew this happy path. \nTrainer should briefly go through the points on the happy path. \nAsk: What do you guys think of this? Does each step make the process easier, or harder for the customers? \nPotential answers could be: \nIt is long\nThere are a few unnecessary steps\nMost people don’t want to wait for more information, they want it right away\nI don’t want to pay in an office for an online service!\nEtc… \n\n9\n\nTHE NOT SO “HAPPY PATH”\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nHappiness\nTime\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nCan someone tell me what they think this is? What happened?\nPotential answers can be: \nIt is a CJM gone wrong\nIt is a happy path with many steps and started to take too long\nSteps 5, 6, and 7 weren’t working well and bothered the user causing a negative customers experience\nIt wasn’t designed for the customer!\nIt is taking a lot of time for the person to get to the end.\nWhich steps aren’t in line with customers? Which steps make them leave or unhappy?\n\nRecap: If there is a step that isn’t working well, it will cause our customers to get frustrated and maybe go to another solution. In reality many customers are not ready to convert they may get distracted by other features of your business. They might drop out of the journey completely and leave the site. You should think critically about your customers journey to make sure that it is clear and simple for them. Many times we only think about the end goal of our customer, but ignore the steps they take to get there. Your solution should be designed with their needs in mind.\n\n\n\n10\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n30 minutes: Activity\n\nSo, keeping in mind that our customers are getting frustrated with our previous happy path, we will make a new one!\nAsk: Does anybody remember the first step to making a happy path? \nIdentify most important, singular goal of your product\nFirst, we have to remember what our promise of value is! In this case, it is convenience of booking and a fair price. Remembering that my customers care most about convenience and price, how should I remodel my business happy path? \n\n25 minutes: Activity\n15 minutes: Group work\nGet into small groups and discuss how we can make sure that this happy path is in line with the promise of value to our customers (which is convenience of booking and price).\nGo where you are comfortable and create a new happy path.\n10 minutes: Share\nCome back to the big group and have the groups share.\nMake sure that the path is staying on point, doesn’t deviate to other features, and doesn’t have any unnecessary steps. \n11\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n3 minutes: Recap \n\nHere is an example of how I shortened the happy path. \nFirst I wrote out my main goal. I need to always remember that my customers care most about convenience and price\nNext, I looked through what I had and I highlighted all the unnecessary steps or things that made it more inconvenient or expensive. I will cut these out!\nKeep in mind that when you change something on here, it will be reflected in your whole business model and how you operate. Think about the effect changes will have on both your customers and your business. \nMake sure this happy path has an overall positive affect and is feasible!\n\n12\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nBrowse tours\nClick on tour\nView details\nBook tour\nPay by credit card\nReceive confirmation email\nAfter sales support\n3 minutes: Recap continued\n\nHere is an example of how I shortened the happy path. \nAfter highlighting the parts that weren’t suitable for my customers, I removed them or replaced them with other, more convenient, steps. \nI cut extra steps out\nI changed the payment method\nI will also save money by automating processes and having less staff. I can transfer this value to the customers (by lowering my price for example) or keep it myself (as more profit).\n\nRecap: Just because this is what I designed right now doesn’t mean I should keep it this way. I have to show it to people and test it with my customers to see if it is right, and find ways to improve. Don’t be stuck on your idea! Be open to changing and adjusting things!\n\n\n13\n\nCREATE YOUR HAPPY PATH! – 25 MINUTES\nIdentify the most important, singular goal of your business? \n2. Start each step with an action  verb.\n3. .Review to see which steps\n    .might cause sales to decrease.\n50 minutes: Activity\n\nNow, we will take some time for all of you to make a happy path of your own. Remember, this activity is to lay out all of the steps that your customers would take to accomplish their goals. If we think about CJM, it includes before during and after!\nBefore: First learning about your product and interacting with it\nDuring: Going through your products/services and choosing to purchase (in here, we put our positive expectation on paper about the relation between product and user)!\nAfter: Any follow up activities that the customer will do\n\n25 minutes: Activity\nIndividual work on their businesses to create their happy path. Some businesses might be multi-sided, leading to more than 1 happy path. Focus on 1 side for now, and do the other one later today.\nUse flipchart paper or something that will be easy to share your work with others. If you are working online, there is a digital version that entrepreneurs can use as a template.\nMake sure you clearly write your UVP at the top and the end goal of your business (make a purchase, download, subscribe, etc…)\nStart with an action that your customer will take\nTrainers should be walking around during this time to help entrepreneurs and answer questions\n\n15 minutes: Post and share\nEntrepreneurs should post their happy paths around the room \nEveryone will get post it notes and provide feedback on each others happy paths.\nIs the path clear and easy for users?\nDoes it accomplish the end goals of the business and customer?\nDo you have any suggestions to improve it?\nIf it is online, entrepreneurs will go into breakout rooms as small groups to share their work and get feedback\n\n10 minutes: Recap\nBring everyone back into the room to discuss.\nAsk: How was it, what did you learn? \n\n14\n\nALTERNATIVE PATHS\nCreating a workflow\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nVisit the blog\nView gallery\nComment on photo\nBrowse tours\nClick on tour\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nNow, you guys just did the “happy path”. This is the customer successfully completing the transaction in the simplest of forms.\nHowever, you need to remember that your business has alternative paths as well. \nYou have a path to register, a path to change settings, etc… \nIf you are a more traditional business, maybe you don’t go right to check out. You walk around, you can add or remove things to your cart, compare items, you might ask for help from the front desk, etc… \nSome of these alternative paths lead to customers dropping off and leaving.\nOnce you have a very clear happy path, start to add more detail and build out your whole workflow. \nTry to keep all the “paths” clean and simple\nMake sure that the alternative paths lead back to the end goal of “make a purchase” (or likewise)\nMake sure that users understand where they are, and where they can go, at all times (especially true for applications/websites).\nJust because it looks simple, doesn’t mean it is! Make sure to run your personas through these paths. \n\nAsk: Why is this important to do?\nWe will use this as a starting point for some other sessions.\nTech businesses: \nThis is an essential step for applications. You will use these workflows as a starting point for our wireframes. If you have clear workflows that you hand over to your developer, you can negotiate a cheaper price. This is one of the most difficult parts to get right!\nNon-tech businesses: \nWe will use these workflows to ensure that we are creating a great user experience for customers. Making sure that processes are simple and user friendly!\n\n15\n\nOUR DESIGN JOURNEY\nValue Proposition\nWorkflow Architecture\nProduct Layout\nUI\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nThis is the first step in a series of steps that will lead us to a perfectly designed product for our customers!\nTrainer should go over each step and explain how we will do it:\nValue proposition: This should be at the forethought of the entrepreneurs minds at all times. All of the other components are built upon delivering value to the customers. We did this during Ignite, and touched on it again today. \nBusiness processes: How does the user interact with your product day to day? What are the actions they take to get the value delivered to them? Again, we started this today through the happy path, but you should go deeper by defining the alternative journeys as well. \nProduct layout: Once we know what we are trying to deliver and the user flow, we must define how users will interact with your business. What does the user do at each step? How do they interact with your actual product? How do they physically navigate through their whole journey? We will spend a lot of time on this when we begin to prototype and test! \nUI: What does the user see? What designs are visible? Color and font schemes are determined to make the product visually appealing. This is the last step. It doesn’t matter if your product looks nice if the user doesn’t have a good experience achieving their goal. \n16\n\nOUR DESIGN JOURNEY\nValue Proposition\nWorkflow Architecture\nProduct Layout\nUI\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nWe have already started! These steps are critical to creating a strong foundation for the rest of our design. Make sure that you spend the next week working on these two parts. We will look at them next Sunday!\n17\n\nBECAUSE…\nGOOD DESIGN \nGOOD BUSINESS\n=\n3 minutes: Lecture \n\nRemember, Good design = Good business\nWhen you are thinking of your customers as you design your product, you are developing a good business. A good business is one that is sustainable, profitable, and has clear competitive advantage (among other things). \nThis is the design of your actual product/service, but also the design of your business (HOW your customer gets and pays for it).\nNext session we will dive into the BMC where we will look at all the different elements of your business. Every single part of your business needs to be designed thoughtfully to make sure that you are able to deliver that promised value to your customers.\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nAdd workflows to your “happy path” of your business and do a peer review. \n\nMake sure that your designs are really solving your customers problems!\n\nDue next Sunday!\n\n\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTrainer note: Some businesses might have a multi-sided business model (marketplaces for instance). Ask the entrepreneurs who have more than 1 happy path to do this for each side of their business.\n19\n\nTHANKS \nANY QUESTIONS?\n20]]]\nHere are our table elements [[[Module\tModule Elements\tGaps Identified\tContent Changes\tActivity Modifications\tPotential Worksheet to Make\tPossible Efficiency Workbook Integration\tReasoning\tNotes \n2.

      "content": " I've reviewed your materials in detail and understand that you want to integrate sustainability elements into the \"Intro to UX\" module, with a particular focus on incorporating green practices into the Customer Journey Mapping (CJM) exercise. Based on the existing curriculum and the sustainable practice suggestion you highlighted, here's my updated table with three high-impact targeted changes:\n\n## Updated Sustainability Integration Table for Module 2: Intro to UX\n\n| Module Element | Sustainability Integration | Implementation Details | Reasoning |\n|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------|\n| Customer Journey Mapping (Slides 2-4) | **Green Touchpoint Identification** | Add a prompt during CJM exercise: \"Where in the customer journey can you showcase sustainable practices that matter to your customers?\" Add examples like packaging choices, energy use visibility, waste reduction steps. | This targets the core CJM activity where participants are already mapping customer interactions. By identifying sustainability touchpoints early, entrepreneurs can build green practices into their business design from the start rather than adding them later. This directly addresses your idea about showcasing sustainable practices within the journey. |\n| Happy Path Design (Slides 7-11) | **Sustainability-Driven Decision Points** | Modify the tourism agency example to include sustainability decision points (e.g., \"Choose eco-friendly tour option,\" \"View carbon offset information\"). Add discussion prompt: \"Which steps in your happy path might cause environmental impact, and how might that affect customer satisfaction?\" | The tourism example is perfect for showcasing sustainable alternatives. Customers increasingly factor sustainability into decisions, especially in tourism. By building this into the path design, entrepreneurs learn to integrate sustainability as a value-add rather than a constraint. |\n| Alternative Paths & Design Journey (Slides 15-17) | **Green Alternative Journey Mapping** | Add sustainability-specific alternative paths: \"How might environmentally conscious customers navigate your product differently?\" Include examples like \"Research product sustainability,\" \"Compare eco-credentials,\" and \"Check recycling options.\" | This leverages the existing \"alternative paths\" concept but extends it to cover green customer behavior. It acknowledges that sustainability-minded customers often take different journeys through products/services and helps entrepreneurs design for this growing segment. |\n\nThe approach I've taken focuses on:\n\n1. **Integration rather than addition** - These changes work within the existing flow of the module rather than adding separate \"green\" sections.\n\n2. **Customer-centric perspective** - The changes emphasize how sustainability affects customer experience, keeping with the UX focus.\n\n3. **Business value alignment** - Each change ties sustainability to potential business value (improved customer satisfaction, new market segments, competitive differentiation) rather than presenting it as purely an environmental concern.\n\nThese changes would enable entrepreneurs to consider sustainability as an integral part of customer experience design from the beginning of their business development journey, while maintaining the core learning objectives of the UX module.",

Based on the existing curriculum and the sustainable practice suggestion you highlighted, here's my updated table with three high-impact targeted changes:\n\n## Updated Sustainability Integration Table for Module 2: Intro to UX\n\n| Module Element | Sustainability Integration | Implementation Details | Reasoning |\n|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------|\n| Customer Journey Mapping (Slides 2-4) | **Green Touchpoint Identification** | Add a prompt during CJM exercise: \"Where in the customer journey can you showcase sustainable practices that matter to your customers?\" Add examples like packaging choices, energy use visibility, waste reduction steps. | This targets the core CJM activity where participants are already mapping customer interactions. By identifying sustainability touchpoints early, entrepreneurs can build green practices into their business design from the start rather than adding them later. This directly addresses your idea about showcasing sustainable practices within the journey. |\n| Happy Path Design (Slides 7-11) | **Sustainability-Driven Decision Points** | Modify the tourism agency example to include sustainability decision points (e.g., \"Choose eco-friendly tour option,\" \"View carbon offset information\"). Add discussion prompt: \"Which steps in your happy path might cause environmental impact, and how might that affect customer satisfaction?\" | The tourism example is perfect for showcasing sustainable alternatives. Customers increasingly factor sustainability into decisions, especially in tourism. By building this into the path design, entrepreneurs learn to integrate sustainability as a value-add rather than a constraint. |\n| Alternative Paths & Design Journey (Slides 15-17) | **Green Alternative Journey Mapping** | Add sustainability-specific alternative paths: \"How might environmentally conscious customers navigate your product differently?\" Include examples like \"Research product sustainability,\" \"Compare eco-credentials,\" and \"Check recycling options.\" | This leverages the existing \"alternative paths\" concept but extends it to cover green customer behavior. It acknowledges that sustainability-minded customers often take different journeys through products/services and helps entrepreneurs design for this growing segment. |\n\nThe approach I've taken focuses on:\n\n1. **Integration rather than addition** - These changes work within the existing flow of the module rather than adding separate \"green\" sections.\n\n2. **Customer-centric perspective** - The changes emphasize how sustainability affects customer experience, keeping with the UX focus.\n\n3. **Business value alignment** - Each change ties sustainability to potential business value (improved customer satisfaction, new market segments, competitive differentiation) rather than presenting it as purely an environmental concern.\n\nThese changes would enable entrepreneurs to consider sustainability as an integral part of customer experience design from the beginning of their business development journey, while maintaining the core learning objectives of the UX module.",

            "extracted_content": "Choicemaking and the Interface\nJoe Edelman 2014\nAbstract\nTheories of choice from economics and philosophy suggest information requirements for good choices. In view of these requirements, we can see why current menus lead toward regrettable and isolating choices. We propose principles for redesigning menu systems, and consider the possibility of a public database about choices and outcomes. Such a system would reshape the media ecosystem and incentives for business.\n\nContents\nIntroduction\n\nHuman choicemaking\n\nSearching for Options Search costs and desperate choices.\nInformation Requirements The role of the device.\nIdentity Our values, our choices, our selves.\nRepairing individual choicemaking\n\nVisible Promises What do we hope for when we click?\nCollective Wisdom Public data, satisfying choices, & lives well lived.\nPromising Recommendations Repairing feeds and autosuggests.\nValue Browsing Administering our own identities.\nBeyond individual choicemaking\n\nSocial Choices Choices are rarely for ourselves.\nBest-Outcome Economies Consequences for business and society.\n\nIntroduction\nMuch of our daily lives are structured by menus. Whether we are deciding which email to respond to, what to order at a restaurant, which stores to visit on a street or in a mall, what job listings to investigate—we navigate our lives by scanning lists of options.\n\nWe can ask, then, what are the responsibilities of menu-makers?\n\nThis essay focus on one key responsibility: to present options on-screen in a manner that is free from bias and manipulation. Currently, many kinds of menus (including, on devices—app stores, notification screens, browsers) are guilty of two broad kinds of manipulation:\n\nHidden costs. Time costs for instance are often unexpected on the internet. Whereas in commerce we are wary of hidden costs, unexpected fees, and consider them dishonest business, unexpected costs via the internet are not yet seen as dishonest.\n\nWhat if time costs were estimated for everything?\n\n\nFalse promises. When an app store sells us a fitness app or a dating app, are user reviews enough information to keep us from wasting our time? We‘ll show that, without providing additional information about how they work out for people, app stores mislead us about the promise of a product. We’d call a salesman a charlatan or a quack, but we don't yet blame the app store.\n\nThis paper takes the position that devices and their menus should serve users. As humans, we tend to choose from what‘s in front of us. It follows that these menus which are so often in front of us have a great influence on our lives. We must bring them into line. At the platform level, devices must take care to populate menus with options aligned with the users’ interests—rather than in the interests of increasing engagement metrics for media companies—and should present those options in a way that lets us choose well, lets us express what‘s important to us, and doesn’t isolate us in the process.\n\nIn other words, we need a menu environment in which to make informed, expressive, and social choices. To begin to design such an environment, we'll need an understanding of (a) how our environment affects our choices, (b) how our choices and our identities evolve together, and (c) what aspects of choice our devices could help us with.\n\n\nHuman choicemaking\nSearching for Options\n“The sea is endless when you are in a rowboat.” — Casares\n\nOur information environment is the medium through which we search for and compare various options when we are making a choice. Because of the environment, some options may be much easier to discover or to recall than others. When an option is hard to find or hard to recall at the moment of choice, we say that it has a high search cost.\n\nSometimes it is our real preferences that determine our choices, but often it is a difference in search costs. When an exhausted worker comes home and immediately switches on the TV, or a tourist goes to McDonald‘s because they don’t know any local places, or a hungry person buys a donut as a snack when they would, in the abstract, prefer mozzarella and tomato hors d'oeuvres—these can be considered rational choices. But they are made based on the disparity of search costs, not because of preferences independent of search costs. We can call them desperate choices, because they were made in a situation where further search felt too costly compared to choosing something suboptimal. For a society, they can be an indication of a failing. ✱\n\n✱ To the extent that coordination is an information and search problem, even the choice to do isolated activities instead of meeting with friends is of this type. For instance, the choice to, on any given day, use internet porn over having a relationship likely is more about search costs (i.e., the difficulty of finding a partner for that day) than about independent preferences (prefering porn to real sex) or non-search transaction costs (e.g., costs of commitment/switching, being charming and humane, etc).\nThe economics literature suggests that even the most hardcore addictions can be considered as desperate choices. While popular psychology regards addiction as a lapse in the ability to choose (e.g., “OMG I just spent 4 hours on facebook.”), economists tend to think of it as either (a) a rational choice made in a bad situation (e.g., “Life sucks let's get high and watch cat videos.”) or as (b) a rational choice made with a misunderstanding (e.g., \"I thought I could spend just a few minutes!“ or ”I thought it'd make me popular and happy!\").\n\nThese interpretations were advanced in a landmark paper by Becker and Murphy which found that cigarette smoking and heroin use are sensitive both to announcements of future tax levels and to independent improvements in life circumstances. That is, people do stop doing heroin when they suddenly have an unexpected chance to go to college, and they can stop smoking if they figure out it's going to be more expensive than they thought. Similar results have been observed with rats and morphine 1 2 3.\n\nThis suggests that a regrettable choice is a desperate choice: not necessarily a character defect, a failure to choose, or a weird preference, but a lack of options at hand. The activities we regret are the ones where we know we could have done better by ourselves (at least if we had known), but the search for better options was too hard at the time. ✱\n\n✱ It follows that interventions that deprive an addict of their drug—in the case of internet addicts, browsing “speedbumps”; for alcohol, prohibitions; etc—will not be as effective as providing better situations for people, or placing better opportunities in the menu at the moment of choice. Behavioral economists are starting to call this navigability.\nTelevision, the Internet, and now mobile phones have dramatically lowered the search costs for certain kinds of entertainment—mostly isolating entertainment—while giving us confusing menus that don't contain the best options we could think of if we tried. When we are tired, absent-minded, time poor, or alone, we are likely to choose from the menus given, rather than engaging in a costly manual search. We are likely to make a desperate choice.\n\n\nInformation Requirements\n“Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, ‘It might have been.’” — Kurt Vonnegut\n\nBut what information in particular is important to guide search, and how can we set an attainable standard for what devices should show us? How could a device be said to have made a best effort to align with our true interest?\n\nI propose the following: when there is information that would help us live better according to our own judgement and values, we would like our devices to surface it promptly and at the moment of choice. I.e., if a device omits easily-obtainable information and so leads us to do something we would regret on review, we may say it has failed us and kept us from choosing well.\n\nTo be clear, avoiding the feeling of regret is not the standard here. We often feel regret about an action even when we were fully informed going into it; we sometimes don‘t feel regret simply because we haven’t had the opportunity to review our activity; finally, we may feel regret over a missed chance that we wouldn't have actually preferred.\n\nFor this reason, we'll focus on designing interfaces that avoid durably regrettable choices—choices where, if we were to review our activity, we‘d be able to name a better option that we wish we’d taken (and that we have since become familiar with)—and specifically the subset that we might call “I wish I had known X” regrettable choices—where we can also name some plausible information that would have helped us understand the options and choose differently. ✱✱ A full explanation of why “Durable I-Wish-I-Had-Known Regret” (DIR) is a good foundation for defining good and bad choices is beyond our scope here. But consider that, in choosing a metric around which to characterise choices, we would want one that: (a) accommodates many value systems across different users, (b) aligns with user intuitions about what‘s good, and (c) aligns with human needs. An inferior metric like “maximal moment-to-moment happiness” fails all of these: some people don’t value happiness, many things widely regarded to be good like grad school and childbirth are not about happiness, and there are ways to be happy that don't align well with human needs. Furthermore: (d) DIR is clearly and quickly evaluable via user reports, (e) that evaluation once made is durable over time, and (f) minimizing DIR correlates well with existing metrics, including maximizing brand trust and net promoter, maximizing positive user sentiment, and minimizing burnout.\n\nShitty menus are those which lead us directly to these regrettable choices. We may feel Durable I-Wish-I-Had-Known Regret because of wrong assumptions about the costs/likelihoods of the option we choose, about the existence or proximity of better options, or about what is important to us about the choice. In particular, shitty menus may be missing information about time costs, money costs, whether hoped-for outcomes are likely, whether unexpected outcomes are likely, whether there are less-costly or otherwise better options for similar outcomes, and even whether our hopes themselves are likely to change.\n\nWithout this information, it is more likely we‘ll make a choice we’ll later regret. Below I'll present designs for browsers, for app stores, and for other device menus that address this.\n\n\nIdentity\n“There are goals other than well-being, and values other than goals.” - Amartya Sen, 1984\n\nOne of the trickiest sources of regret is when we made a choice based on ill-informed values or goals. For instance, we have all made choices based on price where later we wished we had considered another factor as more important. Or sometimes we make purchases based on the mistaken idea that we will continue with a certain project.\n\nThis happens all the time. Perhaps a goal was overly specific, was dependent on some other goal in a way we didn‘t understand, was founded on a misunderstanding, or was just less compelling than a goal or value we hadn’t thought of yet.\n\nIn this map, an arrow is drawn when people tend to migrate from one activity to another activity, and the latter activity is reported to satisfy their desires more effectively.\n\n\nIn which situations do our values shift in this way? And how can we make sure that users remain in charge of their own values, rather than having them directed by the device? As philosopher Ruth Chang has argued, it seems likely that we define and adjust our values while making choices. Specifically, we evolve our values when we have an initial difficulty making a choice because one option seems better in some ways, and another better in a different way. Dr. Chang suggests✱ ✱ It would be good to have better data about these moments of value reconsideration.these are the moments where we reexamine and change our values, and that we often choose a new, more general value for ourselves that makes the choice more clear.\n\nIf this is correct, we need a name for the environments in which this activity of self-construction can proceed fluidly. We will call these environments of expressive choice. To make an expressive choice, users must be able to explore a space of values that might apply to the choice, and to organize the options in front of them in terms of whatever they decide matters to them. As simple a thing as providing widgets for changing the sort order and filtering of options creates more possibility for expressive choice.\n\nIf menus are to help us find decisions we won‘t regret, they must allow us to explore what’s important to us about the options, and to navigate according to what we've decided is important.\n\n\nRepairing individual choicemaking\nVisible Promises\n“Ads sell a great deal more than products. They sell values, images, and concepts of success and worth.” — Brene Brown\n\nWithout an idea of what the user hopes for with a choice, it seems impossible to surface information about better options or related values. We will start our redesign with the notion that when the user has decided to engage with a resource—to go to an event, to use an app, to buy a product, to follow a link, etc—it's because she has a hope, because she is taken with the promise of the engagement. This promise could be the outcome she hopes will result, it could be a value embodied in the choice itself, or it could be an outcome she wishes to avoid. ✱\n\n✱ Our everyday hopes, as we buy things, download apps, book appointments, etc—are few enough that they can all be clearly named. While human pursuits in general are of infinite variety, the key categories for everyday life are: (a) terms related to ideal schedules (e.g. “frequent exercise”), (b) ideal personal states (e.g. “getting hitched”), and (c) ideal tactics (e.g., “acting boldly”).\nWe may, for instance, think of facebook for a quick break, of Sports Authority for not getting fat, or of voice lessons for a courageous move. We can give each such hope a name and then use an on-screen object to let the user navigate by what they're really after.\n\nExample: Browsing\nMost of us have visited facebook.com at some point during work when we needed a break.\n\n\n\nLet‘s say we had been trying to get organized in Gmail. We don’t want to think very hard about what kind of break to take. We lack the time or the energy to make an internal catalogue of options for a break, so we type ‘f’ into the box at the top of the window.\n\nIn today‘s browsers, there is no representation of what I want or of how much time I want to spend. I’m hoping to relax, to take a break, perhaps imagining it will take 5 minutes. But nowhere on the screen do the words “break” or “relax” or “5 minutes” appear. It's as though the device wants me to forget my plans.\n\nA more user-aligned browser would make this explicit. For instance, with an extra tag in the URL bar to capture what the use of the site is about.\n\n\n\nOnce I start navigating to facebook, of course there could be many reasons I'd want to go there.\n\nHere, I can compare how well these uses of facebook have worked out for people. And I can see—maybe for the first time—if there might be a better activity for feeling relaxed.\n\n \n\nExample: Shopping\nOf course the same can work for physical goods:\n\n\n\n\nCollective wisdom\nIn order to display these kinds of cues, we'd need to build giant database about people, about their choices, and about the outcomes of those choices.\n\nThis is a kind of metadata about URLs. When you think about it, it‘s similar to other kinds of metadata about URLs that are already in use today. For instance, Facebook and Google know how many people clicked on a URL or linked to a URL, but they don’t currently know how many are glad they went, and why.\n\nWe can think of this “big data” about people and URLs as a kind of collective intelligence we share with one another, but when you look at the metrics that we mainly use to propel media coverage—likes / clicks / views / purchases / downloads—a better name might be “collective impulse”, because this data is dominated by samples from the impulsive, lost moments in people's days.\n\nAs such, this new big data about people, choices, and outcomes would constitute a real collective wisdom: an alternative to virality, a new claim as to what's worth sharing.\n\nIf collective wisdom can be used to drive distribution and ranking of options, it will mean less-regrettable options at hand for most people. That will mean fewer desperate choices and more lives well lived.\n\nHere's how we might collect it:\n\n\n\nAn outcomes-based review must remind its user of the costs involved in the engagement (time and money, ideally as authenticated via the service provider or the platform), then give them a quick, precise way to report what the engagement was about, how their desired outcomes have worked out so far, and what else has happened.\n\nEven a small number (say 50,000) of reviews could be a significant public resource, guiding people away from likely regret and towards time well spent. To provide meaningful signals across all the top apps and web products, we will need an articulate, representative, and thoughtful set of reviewers, but not so many of them.\n\nAs a data API, this collection would be a google maps or OpenStreetMap for life decisions—augmenting all manner of shopping, browsing, and list experiences, allowing users to sort by likely outcomes, relevancy to their own desires for personal growth or for scheduling, etc.\n\nSuch an API could be used for sourcing and sorting suggestions for friend get-togethers, for instance:\n\nThis interface was tested with a few thousand users as part of a defunct startup. The results suggested that user behavior can change significantly when recommendations are ordered by desired outcome and ranked by reported likelihood of an outcome working out.\n\n\nAs a destination site, this collection would be like Wikipedia or Quora, but focused on life choices made, what they were about for the individuals involved, and how it all worked out. Visitors could review choices about downloading/using apps, websites, products, etc—but they could also review larger engagements, like moving to a new city, going freelance, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromising Recommendations\nAlgorithmic menus like Facebook Newsfeed and Google Now are even more important to align with our true interests, because they've begun to structure even more of our discretionary time.\n\nA full treatment of recommender systems and feeds will come later.\n\n\n\n\nValue Browsing\nTo be written.\n\n\nBeyond individual choicemaking\n\n“Isolation underpins technology, and technology isolates in its turn; all goods proposed by the spectacular system, from cars to televisions, also serve as weapons for that system as it strives to reinforce the isolation of ‘the lonely crowd.’” — Guy Debord\n\n“Computers, video, radio, printing presses, synthesizers, fax machines, tape recorders, photocopiers — these things make great toys, but terrible addictions. Finally we realize that we cannot ”reach out and touch someone“ who is not present in the flesh.” — Hakim Bey\n\nSocial Choices\nTo be written\n\n\nBest-Outcome Economies\nOne measure of the health of an economy is whether the interests of businesses are aligned with the interests of their customers or users. To be quantitative about this, we can check whether sales and spending figures match up with long-term satisfaction ratings, with customers' health, and with other measurements of well-being.\n\nThe epidemics that currently face the modernized countries—obesity, social isolation, depression, a lack of meaningful work, and so on—indicate just such a misalignment. We are seeing sales that make customers' lives worse. Industry and marketing focus on clicks, views, downloads, and sales, rather than on our long-term desired outcomes.\n\nCONSUMER SPENDING. If we imagine an outcome economy—our society re-gearing around longer-term forms of satisfaction: How would it be different from the consumption economy pictured, that we have today? Click for an explorable map from nytimes.com\n\n\nTo outcome-align our society would require both (a) detecting when and how best our true interests are satisfied, and (b) either reshaping traffic / sales or otherwise changing incentives for businesses and organizations to match those reports of long-term satisfaction.\n\nIt is likely that more will be required to reshape demand than just better menus, but the collective wisdom gathered via retrospective reviews can tell us when the incentives are misaligned. We can then decide as a society how to disincentivize businesses from leading us into activities we regret.\n\nThe potential switch is from marketplaces that are mostly about transactions to marketplaces for personal outcomes, and means redirecting attention and cashflow towards providers and sites that produce the best outcomes, best livelihoods, and lowest costs in users' lives, rather than those with viral loops, network effects, marketing deals, or other advantages.\n\nConclusion\n“We shall once more value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful. We shall honor those who can teach us how to pluck the hour and the day virtuously and well.” — John Maynard Keynes\n\nIn 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes claimed that the sales metrics that drive capitalism would at some point start driving us in the wrong direction. Perhaps that time has come. Can we measure demand with the question “what are you glad that you bought?” instead of “what did you buy?”, or online, with “what are you glad you clicked?” rather than “what did you click?” Can we tether the lifeblood of our economy—cashflow, attention, and resources—to reports of informed and fulfilled lives? Would people then work together to create the best outcomes for one another—in much the same way they currently collaborate to generate sales, clicks, and views?\n\nSummary\nA standard for judging the device's responsibility to its owner is advisable.\n\nAt the platform level, devices should give us options aligned with our own interests—rather than in the interests of increasing engagement metrics for media companies, and should present those options in a way that lets us choose well.\n\nThis requires giving us informed, expressive, and social choices.\n\nEnabling informed choice may require that options listings be augmented with likely time costs, likely money costs, the unlikelihood of various hoped-for outcomes, the likelihood of unhoped-for outcomes, whether there are less-costly or better-success-rate options for similar outcomes, and even whether our hopes themselves are likely to change.\n\nEnabling expressive choice means that options presented must relate to the values and outcomes that are, or that could be, important to us.\n\nA public data service about people, choices, and outcomes could change search costs and behavior.\n\nThese models of informed choice, expressive choice, and collective wisdom relate to microeconomics of addiction, behavioral economics, and current social issues like obesity, depression, a lack of meaningful work, sexual dysfunction, clickhole media / the buzzfeedification of media, and “internet addiction”.\n\nRecommended Reading\nTo be written.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Tom Chi and Glen Chiacchieri for direct feedback on drafts of this paper.\n\nThanks to Tristan Harris, Bret Victor, Jonathan Harris, Aza Raskin, and Dan Mosedale for motivating and clarifying discussions.\n\n"

But what if we expanded our understanding of what makes a truly 'happy' customer? Research suggests customers increasingly value not just convenience, but also whether their purchases align with their deeper values and contribute to lasting wellbeing.\n\nThe truly happy path isn't just about making a transaction smoother - it's about helping customers make choices they won't later regret by showing what truly matters. Notice how this journey starts with values clarification, incorporates sustainability information, and ends with understanding the broader impact of choices.\n\nFor our greengrocer example, this might mean showing not just price and delivery time, but also information about local sourcing, carbon footprint, fair labor practices, or packaging waste. The customer still gets their groceries, but they also get the lasting satisfaction of knowing their purchase aligns with what they truly value.\n\nAsk yourself: What values do your target customers hold? How could your customer journey help them make choices that align with these values? What information might they later wish they had known at the time of purchase?\"\n\nThis approach would fit naturally after your existing greengrocer example slides and sets up a discussion about how to incorporate sustainability values into customer journeys in a way that enhances, rather than complicates, the user experience.",

Intro to UX | After the Greengrocer Happy Path Example (After Slide 9) | Current focus only on transaction completion, not long-term satisfaction | Add new slide \"From Happy Path to No-Regrets Path\" showing how the same journey can include information customers might later wish they had known | After showcasing the greengrocer examples, ask: \"What information might customers wish they had known before making their purchase? How could we include this at each step without complicating the journey?\" | This builds directly on the existing greengrocer activity while introducing sustainability considerations in a way that's practical for entrepreneurs at any stage |\n\nThis approach doesn't push values on customers nor does it assume what people should care about. Instead, it empowers entrepreneurs to provide information transparency that enables informed choices, regardless of what values their customers prioritize.\n\nThe guiding question \"What might customers later wish they had known?\" is practical and business-focused while still leading naturally to sustainability considerations like product origins, real environmental costs, and disposal options.",

This design shows how UX creates different customer journeys by offering alternative views that highlight different values.\n\nThe slide shows:\n\n1. A standard customer flow at the top (similar to your existing tourism example)\n2. Two alternative \"product views\" that could appear at the browsing step:\n   - A standard product view showing typical price-based options\n   - A value-aligned view with sustainability filters and information that matters beyond price\n\nThe key insight is that providing alternative paths in your UX isn't just about navigation - it's also about what information you present at each step. The right side shows how adding value-based filters and additional information creates an alternative path where customers can make choices aligned with what matters to them.\n\n## Facilitation Notes for This Slide:\n\nWhen discussing this slide, you could explain:\n\n\"When we design alternative paths in our customer journeys, we need to consider not just *where* customers can go, but *what information* they see along the way. The choices we make about what to show - and what not to show - directly shape what customers think about.\n\nNotice the difference between these two product views. The standard view only shows price and basic product categories. The value-aligned view adds filters for quality, sustainability, and time, plus additional information about materials, impact, and wait times.\n\nThis is what Joe Edelman means by 'what's on the menu is what's on the mind.' If sustainability information isn't visible in your UX, customers literally can't consider it in their decision, even if they would care about it.\n\nThink about your own product or service: What information might customers value that isn't currently visible in your customer journey? How might adding alternative paths that surface this information change the choices they make?\"\n\nThis slide would fit naturally after your existing \"ALTERNATIVE PATHS\" slide (slide 15 in your module), showing a concrete example of how alternative paths can incorporate value-aligned options.",

            "text": "\n\nI've created a new slide that combines the concepts of alternative paths and value-aligned menu design. This design shows how UX creates different customer journeys by offering alternative views that highlight different values.\n\nThe slide shows:\n\n1. A standard customer flow at the top (similar to your existing tourism example)\n2. Two alternative \"product views\" that could appear at the browsing step:\n   - A standard product view showing typical price-based options\n   - A value-aligned view with sustainability filters and information that matters beyond price\n\nThe key insight is that providing alternative paths in your UX isn't just about navigation - it's also about what information you present at each step. The right side shows how adding value-based filters and additional information creates an alternative path where customers can make choices aligned with what matters to them.\n\n## Facilitation Notes for This Slide:\n\nWhen discussing this slide, you could explain:\n\n\"When we design alternative paths in our customer journeys, we need to consider not just *where* customers can go, but *what information* they see along the way. The choices we make about what to show - and what not to show - directly shape what customers think about.\n\nNotice the difference between these two product views. The standard view only shows price and basic product categories. The value-aligned view adds filters for quality, sustainability, and time, plus additional information about materials, impact, and wait times.\n\nThis is what Joe Edelman means by 'what's on the menu is what's on the mind.' If sustainability information isn't visible in your UX, customers literally can't consider it in their decision, even if they would care about it.\n\nThink about your own product or service: What information might customers value that isn't currently visible in your customer journey? How might adding alternative paths that surface this information change the choices they make?\"\n\nThis slide would fit naturally after your existing \"ALTERNATIVE PATHS\" slide (slide 15 in your module), showing a concrete example of how alternative paths can incorporate value-aligned options.",

How are you doing today? \nToday, we will talk all about your customers journey with your business. We will take a look at your business from the perspective of your customers. This is an essential step right at the beginning and throughout the program as you develop your business to make sure that what you are designing fit the needs of your customers. \n\n1\n\n Reflect on CJM and why it is important. \n Map out the ideal customer journey or  “happy path” for your business.\n Identify areas of opportunity that we will use when developing your business model.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nReflect on customer journey mapping and why it is important.\nMap out the ideal customer journey or “happy path” for your business\nIdentify areas of opportunity that we will use when developing your business model\n2\n\nWHAT IS CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAPPING?\nTime\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nRecap customer journey map from Ignite\nAsk: What do you remember from the CJM?\nPotential answers could be:\nIt is mapping the users experience (UX) with your product or service\nA customer (or user) journey map is a detailed record of a customer’s experience of doing something. \nThe journey covers three parts, before, during, and after. \nThis should be put in the context of a potential customer trying to accomplish something related to your business.\nUnderstand customer values and emotions\nIt is the USERS EXPERIENCE with your product.\n\nAsk: Why should you understand your users journey and experience with your product? What is the benefit of that?\nPotential answers could be:\nTo know what the users go through while they try to meet their needs while respecting their values.\nMake our business easy and convenient for our customers.\nA customer journey map can help you build empathy towards your users as you try to experience what they go through. \nIt can also uncover insights, such as when you compare journeys between customers to find common threads or find conflicting behaviors within a customer’s journey.\nIt is a way to find new opportunities that we can implement for our business\n“A successful customer journey map will give you real insight into what your customers want and any parts of your product, brand or process that aren’t delivering.”\n3\n\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\n\n\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nValues & Information Needs\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nCUSTOMER JOURNEY MAP\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nReview CJM tool\nThis is the tool that you all used during Ignite, so I hope it is familiar to you. \nAs you all mentioned earlier, you can see a big focus identifying the actual behaviors of customers. For each step a customer has a specific goal in mind. With each step emotions come up as well. Maybe they are excited, happy, or even frustrated with the process. We use this information to as a way to identify new opportunities that will make things better for our customers/user.\nCustomer journeys map not just how users accomplish tasks, but also how they express their values through purchasing decisions\nEnsure the persona’s objectives are inline with their goals,  wants, needs and values. \nAt each step, customers may need specific information related to their values - what information would they want at this point?\nWe have already done this based on your customers experience without your competitors business, now we will try and map out what their experience would be with YOUR product or service. \nWe are going to start with what is called “happy path”, which is focusing just on the steps (the highlighted part on the slide) your user/customer will take to successfully accomplish a goal (make a purchase for example). \nWe don’t know the emotions and behaviors of our customers with our product yet because we haven’t developed and tested it yet. Therefore we are only focusing on the steps. We will create the whole CJM for our business as be begin to prototype and develop more!\n\n\n\nDraw a happy path for a greengrocer shop with a goal to serve orders really fast!\nHAPPY PATH:\n10-15 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nBrainstorm: So let’s do an example of this together. Let's imagine we are a green grocer shop. Our main value that differentiates ourselves from our competitors is that we serve our customers very quickly. Now let’s design the happy path for our customers. Again, the happy path is the journey the customer would take to successfully complete their goal.\n\nAsk: What do you suggest? What are the steps our customers should go through to buy fresh fruit and vegetables from? \nWrite the happy path out on white board or on a Jamboard.\nPeople might answer something like this:\nListing what they need to purchase from our store\nCustomer thinks about which store to go to so they can get their groceries\nGo to our store\nEnter the store and explore it\nEvaluate the quality of produce\nPut food into your basket\nGo to check out and pay\nRequest delivery\nEtc…\n\nTrainer tips:\nMake sure to manage the board in a way to make sure the steps happen in the right order, even though people might make suggestions out of order.\nPeople might want to talk about what the business should be doing and how to run the business. Write these points on the side as ideas, but make sure to focus on the steps of the customer.\nAn entrepreneur might want to point out that the customer isn’t happy and leaves without purchasing, or maybe gets distracted by something. In that case point out that it is important to construct alternative user experiences to allow for “not happy” path journeys, but that is not our focus today. Assume they go to purchase.\n\nAsk: Why do we make this?\nWe do this to get a clear picture of your business and the journey of your customers in an obvious way. \nClarity on what is most important and what you should be doing\nFocus on Prioritize the key point of value when developing business\nSimplify and have a visual description\nWe need to start here to frame the rest of the incubator. This will be helpful when we get into prototyping as well and developing an MVP.\n\n5\n\nHAPPY PATH:\nDraw a happy path for a greengrocer shop with a goal to serve orders really fast!\nPark the car\nPick up \npre-filled packages\nPlace package on register\nPay money\nPut items in your car\nOpen the app\nAdd items to basket\nConfirm purchase request\nSelect payment method\nSelect delivery method\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\n5 minutes: Example\nAs you remember from Ignite, not all of our customers are the same. We have different personas representing groups of people with different needs. Remember my goal is to be fast and convenient. I always keep this value proposition in mind!\n\nOne happy path that I designed looks like this (show first row). This is a persona who likes to go to the store.\nThe first step here is that customers park their cars. \nIn order to make it fast, I made pre-filled packages that customers can just pick up without going around the store\nThen they go to the register and pay\nFinally they go to their car.\n\nMy second persona is someone who likes to use technology. Therefore I made an app for them. (show second happy path)\nThe journey with my app looks like:\nOpen the app\nAdd needed items to the basket\nConfirm order request\nSend payment method\nSelect delivery method (pick up in store or delivery)\nReceive fresh food to your door.\nYou can point out that there might be actions missing such as “browse items” before you add them to the cart. You want to be simple, but also comprehensive and include all the actions.\n\nRecap: \nFor each of these steps, if I see that customers will take a lot of effort to do it, I should consider changing it to something else or cutting out the step if possible.\nIn each step, I am talking about the steps my customer is taking. It is not from the perspective of the business.\nI considered my personas needs. These journeys were made based off of the user research that I did and the needs I found! \n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: “why we should do this? Why we should focus on designing the user experience with such care? (this leads us to the next slide).\nPotential answers can be: \nWe do this to get a clear picture of how your customers experience your business in a highly obvious way.\nSimplify everything in your head and have a visual description,\nWe want clarity on what is most important and what your customers end goal is (making a sale, signing up, or something else),\nWe need to start here to frame the rest of the incubator. This will be helpful when we get into prototyping as well and developing an MVP.\n\n6\n\nCustomers are balancing between their needs and their values.\n\nEx: They want their groceries quickly while also limiting pollution.\n\nUnderstanding values opens doors for differentiation and new products and services.\nTHE TRULY HAPPY PATH\nCreating Value Through Values\n10-15 Minutes: Values Discussion\nBrainstorm: What truly makes us happy? Is it just achieving goals, or also the journey and its impact?\nReflect: Think of a regretted purchase—what missing information could have prevented it? How can UX design help customers avoid similar regrets?\nDiscuss: Share examples where you made values-based purchasing decisions. How did it shape your experience?\nApply: How might customer values influence their steps when shopping at our green grocer?\nConsider: Consider a prior purchase you regretted. What tools or info would have helped you make a better decision? (Example: Nutrition labels, fair-trade certifications, price-per-unit comparison.)\nExample 1 (E-commerce): Highlighting most popular vs. most ethical purchasing options.\nExample 2 (Grocery Stores): Stores arranging convenience-based shopping vs. values-based shopping (e.g., organic/local products).\n7\n\nWHAT IS THE GOAL?\nTo deliver value and make sales \n+\n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nRecap: \nThere are both user goals and business goals that need to be considered! A great entrepreneur is able to align these 2 goals in a successful way! \nValue creation happens when customers can both meet their needs AND express their values through their choices\nAsk: How might helping customers make choices aligned with their values increase their loyalty to your business?\nAlthough a happy path may seem very simple and matter of fact, it is essential to create a business model that you and your customers benefit from. This is all rooted in our customers needs and emotions. \nDo NOT forget about your Unique Value Proposition! We have spent so much time looking at the market and seeing where the we can really add value to our customers, we need to develop our product to meet those needs. \nAlthough you might have many great features and elements of your business, we want to focus on and prioritize the key point of value (UVP) when developing your business. Remember we are offering value to make sales (or another business goal)!\nTime and time again, when an entrepreneur interacts with investors, mentors, judges, or other business people, the most consistent feedback is that the UVP is unclear! Highlight it!\nNever forget about your UVP! \n\n\n\n8\n\nFOCUS ON THE STEPS:\n\n1. Identify the most important,      singular goal of your business.\n\n2. Start each step with an action verb.\n\n3. |Review to see which steps might cause sales to decrease.\n\n5 minutes: Lecture \n\nSo how will we create our happy paths? It is easy:\nIdentify most important, singular goal of your business. Identify your purpose. There has to be a purpose/goal at the end of the happy path. This is probably you getting paid for the key value you delivered. Each feature of your product should contribute to that one goal in some way!\n\nStart with an action verb. Every step of your happy path should be very clear and start with an action verb. What is the action that your customer does at this step to get them closer to the promise of value that your business is offering?\n\nReview to see which steps might cause sales to decrease? After you do those 2 simple steps, take a step back and review it. Are these steps simple and easy for your customer to get to the end and benefit from your product/service? How can you improve it?\n\nLet’s do an example together to clarify the steps.\n\n9\n\nTHE “HAPPY PATH”: TOURISM AGENCY\nDraw the happy path and describe the experience of your personas who are for the first time buying and using your product or service!\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nSo here is an example of a tourism agency. \nFor this business we drew this happy path. \nTrainer should briefly go through the points on the happy path. \nAsk: What do you guys think of this? Does each step make the process easier, or harder for the customers? \nPotential answers could be: \nIt is long\nThere are a few unnecessary steps\nMost people don’t want to wait for more information, they want it right away\nI don’t want to pay in an office for an online service!\nEtc… \n\n10\n\nTHE NOT SO “HAPPY PATH”\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nHappiness\nTime\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nCan someone tell me what they think this is? What happened?\nPotential answers can be: \nIt is a CJM gone wrong\nIt is a happy path with many steps and started to take too long\nSteps 5, 6, and 7 weren’t working well and bothered the user causing a negative customers experience\nIt wasn’t designed for the customer!\nIt is taking a lot of time for the person to get to the end.\nWhich steps aren’t in line with customers? Which steps make them leave or unhappy?\n\nRecap: If there is a step that isn’t working well, it will cause our customers to get frustrated and maybe go to another solution. In reality many customers are not ready to convert they may get distracted by other features of your business. They might drop out of the journey completely and leave the site. You should think critically about your customers journey to make sure that it is clear and simple for them. Many times we only think about the end goal of our customer, but ignore the steps they take to get there. Your solution should be designed with their needs in mind.\n\n\n\n11\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n30 minutes: Activity\n\nSo, keeping in mind that our customers are getting frustrated with our previous happy path, we will make a new one!\nAsk: Does anybody remember the first step to making a happy path? \nIdentify most important, singular goal of your product\nFirst, we have to remember what our promise of value is! In this case, it is convenience of booking and a fair price. Remembering that my customers care most about convenience and price, how should I remodel my business happy path? \n\n25 minutes: Activity\n15 minutes: Group work\nGet into small groups and discuss how we can make sure that this happy path is in line with the promise of value to our customers (which is convenience of booking and price).\nGo where you are comfortable and create a new happy path.\n10 minutes: Share\nCome back to the big group and have the groups share.\nMake sure that the path is staying on point, doesn’t deviate to other features, and doesn’t have any unnecessary steps. \n12\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n3 minutes: Recap \n\nHere is an example of how I shortened the happy path. \nFirst I wrote out my main goal. I need to always remember that my customers care most about convenience and price\nNext, I looked through what I had and I highlighted all the unnecessary steps or things that made it more inconvenient or expensive. I will cut these out!\nKeep in mind that when you change something on here, it will be reflected in your whole business model and how you operate. Think about the effect changes will have on both your customers and your business. \nMake sure this happy path has an overall positive affect and is feasible!\n\n13\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nBrowse eco-friendly tour options\nClick on tour\nView details\nBook tour\nPay by credit card\nReceive confirmation email\nAfter sales support\n3 minutes: Recap continued\n\nHere is an example of how I shortened the happy path. \nAfter highlighting the parts that weren’t suitable for my customers, I removed them or replaced them with other, more convenient, steps. \nI cut extra steps out\nI changed the payment method\nI will also save money by automating processes and having less staff. I can transfer this value to the customers (by lowering my price for example) or keep it myself (as more profit).\n\nRecap: Just because this is what I designed right now doesn’t mean I should keep it this way. I have to show it to people and test it with my customers to see if it is right, and find ways to improve. Don’t be stuck on your idea! Be open to changing and adjusting things!\n\n\n14\n\nCREATE YOUR HAPPY PATH! – 25 MINUTES\nIdentify the most important, singular goal of your business? \n2. Start each step with an action verb.\n3. .Review to see which steps\n    .might cause sales to decrease.\n50 minutes: Activity\n\nNow, we will take some time for all of you to make a happy path of your own. Remember, this activity is to lay out all of the steps that your customers would take to accomplish their goals. If we think about CJM, it includes before during and after!\nBefore: First learning about your product and interacting with it\nDuring: Going through your products/services and choosing to purchase (in here, we put our positive expectation on paper about the relation between product and user)!\nAfter: Any follow up activities that the customer will do\n\n25 minutes: Activity\nIndividual work on their businesses to create their happy path. Some businesses might be multi-sided, leading to more than 1 happy path. Focus on 1 side for now, and do the other one later today.\nUse flipchart paper or something that will be easy to share your work with others. If you are working online, there is a digital version that entrepreneurs can use as a template.\nMake sure you clearly write your UVP at the top and the end goal of your business (make a purchase, download, subscribe, etc…)\nStart with an action that your customer will take\nTrainers should be walking around during this time to help entrepreneurs and answer questions\n\n15 minutes: Post and share\nEntrepreneurs should post their happy paths around the room \nEveryone will get post it notes and provide feedback on each others happy paths.\nIs the path clear and easy for users?\nDoes it accomplish the end goals of the business and customer?\nDo you have any suggestions to improve it?\nIf it is online, entrepreneurs will go into breakout rooms as small groups to share their work and get feedback\n\n10 minutes: Recap\nBring everyone back into the room to discuss.\nAsk: How was it, what did you learn? \n\n15\n\nALTERNATIVE PATHS\nCreating a workflow\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nVisit the blog\nView gallery\nComment on photo\nBrowse tours\nClick on tour\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nNow, you guys just did the “happy path”. This is the customer successfully completing the transaction in the simplest of forms.\nHowever, you need to remember that your business has alternative paths as well. \nYou have a path to register, a path to change settings, etc… \nIf you are a more traditional business, maybe you don’t go right to check out. You walk around, you can add or remove things to your cart, compare items, you might ask for help from the front desk, etc… \nSome of these alternative paths lead to customers dropping off and leaving.\nOnce you have a very clear happy path, start to add more detail and build out your whole workflow. \nTry to keep all the “paths” clean and simple\nMake sure that the alternative paths lead back to the end goal of “make a purchase” (or likewise)\nMake sure that users understand where they are, and where they can go, at all times (especially true for applications/websites).\nJust because it looks simple, doesn’t mean it is! Make sure to run your personas through these paths. \n\nAsk: Why is this important to do?\nWe will use this as a starting point for some other sessions.\nTech businesses: \nThis is an essential step for applications. You will use these workflows as a starting point for our wireframes. If you have clear workflows that you hand over to your developer, you can negotiate a cheaper price. This is one of the most difficult parts to get right!\nNon-tech businesses: \nWe will use these workflows to ensure that we are creating a great user experience for customers. Making sure that processes are simple and user friendly!\n\n16\n\nSee ad on social media\nSee ad on social media\nVALUE INFORMED “HAPPY PATHS”\nWhat’s on the menu is what’s on the mind.\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nFacilitator discuss: \nWhat we show in each path signals what we think customers should value. Alternative presentations can highlight different aspects of the same product.\nCustomers want their needs met and their values are upheld. Showing your customers their values through the user experience design is an element of creating a happy customer path.\nFor customers, what’s on the menu is what’s on the mind. Ensure their values are expressed in a clear way all through the user experience and design.\nDiscuss: What are some benefits and challenges that arise as we develop customer journeys which incorporate customer values alongside their needs and wants?\n\n17\n\nOUR DESIGN JOURNEY\nValue Proposition\nWorkflow Architecture\nProduct Layout\nUI\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nThis is the first step in a series of steps that will lead us to a perfectly designed product for our customers!\nTrainer should go over each step and explain how we will do it:\nValue proposition: This should be at the forethought of the entrepreneurs minds at all times. All of the other components are built upon delivering value to the customers. We did this during Ignite, and touched on it again today. Understanding your customers value proposition, includes the needs and wants as well as their values.\nBusiness processes: How does the user interact with your product day to day? What are the actions they take to get the value delivered to them? Again, we started this today through the happy path, but you should go deeper by defining the alternative journeys as well. \nProduct layout: Once we know what we are trying to deliver and the user flow, we must define how users will interact with your business. What does the user do at each step? How do they interact with your actual product? How do they physically navigate through their whole journey? We will spend a lot of time on this when we begin to prototype and test! \nUI: What does the user see? What designs are visible? Color and font schemes are determined to make the product visually appealing. This is the last step. It doesn’t matter if your product looks nice if the user doesn’t have a good experience achieving their goal. \n18\n\nOUR DESIGN JOURNEY\nValue Proposition\nWorkflow Architecture\nProduct Layout\nUI\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nWe have already started! These steps are critical to creating a strong foundation for the rest of our design. Make sure that you spend the next week working on these two parts. We will look at them next Sunday!\n19\n\nBECAUSE…\nGOOD DESIGN \nGOOD BUSINESS\n=\n3 minutes: Lecture \n\nRemember, Good design = Good business\nWhen you are thinking of your customers as you design your product, you are developing a good business. A good business is one that is sustainable, profitable, and has clear competitive advantage (among other things). \nThis is the design of your actual product/service, but also the design of your business (HOW your customer gets and pays for it).\nNext session we will dive into the BMC where we will look at all the different elements of your business. Every single part of your business needs to be designed thoughtfully to make sure that you are able to deliver that promised value to your customers.\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nAdd workflows to your “happy path” of your business and do a peer review. \n\nMake sure that your designs are really solving your customers problems!\n\nDue next Sunday!\n\n\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTrainer note: Some businesses might have a multi-sided business model (marketplaces for instance). Ask the entrepreneurs who have more than 1 happy path to do this for each side of their business.\n21\n\nTHANKS\u000b\nANY QUESTIONS?\n22\n"

The changes you've made are excellent, particularly the addition of the \"Truly Happy Path\" slide and the integration of values throughout the customer journey mapping process.\n\nHere's my review and suggestions for improvements:\n\n## Table Review and Updates\n\nYour table captures most of the key changes, but I'd suggest a few additions to make it more comprehensive:\n\n| Module | Module Elements | Gaps Identified | Content Changes | Activity Modifications |\n|--------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| **2.

How are you doing today? \nToday, we will talk about the business model canvas and how it relates to your business. As you remember from the last session, we looked at a very simple way of how your business would work, through the “happy path”, now we will use BMC as a tool to make sure that you consider every part of your business and allow the “happy path” to function!\nThis session will stay at a high level for now. It is about getting a snapshot, not going into detail! We will go into detail during future sessions.\n\n1\n\nUnderstand the various parts of the Business Model Canvas (BMC).\nFill in the parts of your own business model.\nIdentify assumptions you are making about your business model.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nUnderstand the various parts of the Business Model Canvas (BMC).\nFill in the parts of your own business model.\nIdentify assumptions you are making about your business.\n\n\n\nThe majority of information in the notes of this slide deck comes from Strategyzer. You can read more about the Business Model Canvas and how to apply it here: https://strategyzer.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/topics/113454-using-our-tools-canvases-methods\n\n2\n\nYOUR  BUSINESS MODEL\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat is a business model? What does it consist of? Who already has a clear picture of their business model?\nPotential answers could be:\nThe key building blocks you need to develop, manage, maintain, market, and sell a product\nHow your business makes money (many people might only consider their revenue model and not talk about the other parts of BMC)\nSome people will probably talk about the BMC, so then encourage a discussion about identifying the different parts. Then you can lead into the next part where you go deeper and explain each of the parts and go over examples for each\n\nRecap: Today we’ll show you how the business model canvas works and how you can use it to come up with a high-level product strategy. Using the business model canvas approach is a great way to force yourself to focus on the most strategically important elements of your product. The BMC is high level, but over the coming weeks, we will do a deep dive into all of these points.\n\n\n3\n\n*https://strategyzer.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/topics/113454-using-our-tools-canvases-methods\nREVENUE STREAMS\nCOST STRUCTURE\nCUSTOMER SEGMENT\nCHANNELS\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nVALUE PROPOSITION\nKEY RESOURCES\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nKEY PARTNERS\nYOUR BUSINESS MODEL\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo we talked about this already a little bit, but I want to show how the different pieces of BMC fits together\nExplain how the BMC fits together as a story:\nStart with the right side: \nYou have a product that delivers value (value proposition) to your different customer segments. If we want them to know about the product/value offered, we use different channels to reach them. Once we have reached the customer segments, we want to build relationships with them to get them coming back. Delivering value to your customers allows you to make sales and bring in revenue (maybe they even bring friends along). \nWhere have you seen this before? \nThis is what they did during Ignite!\nYou should have a clear picture of your customers, what they care about, how to reach them, and have an idea of how you will actually make money through this interaction. \n\nMove on to the left side:\nNext let’s look at all the key activities you need to do in order to make this a reality. You need to put in work and resources to build and deliver the value you promised to your customers. There are a lot of activities and resources that go into the consistent delivery of value to your customers (running your business). You usually can’t do it all yourself. In this case, you need to find the right partners to help you achieve your tasks. These partners can help by providing resources (human, financial, etc…) or by taking responsibility for some key activities. All of this costs money to do. \n\nConclusion: In the next slides, we are going to go point by point on the BMC to understand it more. We will discuss the different parts as a group and go over an example. After that, there will be time to apply it to your business. Keep in mind that this session will stay fairly high level for now. It is about getting a snapshot, not going into detail! We will go into detail during future sessions.\n\nTransition to the next slide: We will start with the value proposition.\n\n\nWhat your customer really wants\nWhat you do very well\nWhat your competitors do very well\nWho cares?\nDon’t go there\nValue proposition\nVALUE PROPOSITION\n<3 minutes: Discussion\n\nDo you remember what a value proposition is? What is it?\nPotential answers:\nThe product’s value propositions (The promise of value your product offers)\nYour Value Proposition is the reason why customers turn to your company over another. It solves your customer’s problem or satisfies your customer’s needs. \nSome Value Propositions may be innovative and represent a new or disruptive offer. Others may be similar to existing market offers, but with added features and attributes.\nThe things that differentiate you from your competitors. How are you in your customers mind?\nExamples: \nCheaper\nFaster\nBetter quality\nMore convenient? \nNew or innovative\nEtc…\n\nDepending on time, call on some people in the class and have them share their value propositions:\nWe did this during Ignite, you should all know what makes you different and why your customers want/need you. \n“A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you”\n\nIf you are having trouble identifying your UVP, ask yourself the following:\nWhat value do we deliver to the customer?\nWhich one of our customer's problems are we helping to solve?\nWhich job are we helping the customer get done?\nWhich customer needs are we satisfying?\nWhat bundles of products and services are we offering to each Customer Segment?\n\n--------\nMore details on different common value propositions. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\n--------\nTypes of Value Propositions: Your Value Proposition creates value for a Customer Segment through a distinct mix of elements catering to that segment’s needs. Values may be quantitative (e.g. price, speed of service) or qualitative (e.g. design, customer experience). Elements from the following non-exhaustive list can contribute to customer value creation:\nNewness: Some Value Propositions satisfy an entirely new set of needs that customers previously didn’t perceive because there was no similar offering. This is often, but not always, technology related. Cell phones for instance, created a whole new industry around mobile telecommunication. On the other hand, products such as ethical investment funds have little to do with new technology.\nPerformance: Improving product or service performance has traditionally been a common way to create value. The PC sector has traditionally relied on this factor by bringing more powerful machines to market. But improved performance has its limits. In recent years, for example, faster PCs, more disk storage space, and better graphics have failed to produce corresponding growth in customer demand.\nCustomization: Tailoring products and services to the specific needs of individual customers or Customer Segments creates value. In recent years, the concepts of mass customization and customer co-creation have gained importance. This approach allows for customized products and services, while still taking advantage of economies of scale.\n“Getting the job done”: Value can be created simply by helping a customer get certain jobs done. Rolls-Royce understands this very well: its airline customers rely entirely on Rolls- Royce to manufacture and service their jet engines. This arrangement allows customers to focus on running their airlines. In return, the airlines pay Rolls- Royce a fee for every hour an engine runs.\nDesign: Design is an important but difficult element to measure. A product may stand out because of superior design. In the fashion and consumer electronics industries, design can be a particularly important part of the Value Proposition.\nBrand/status: Customers may find value in the simple act of using and displaying a specific brand. Wearing a Rolex watch signifies wealth, for example. On the other end of the spectrum, skateboarders may wear the latest “underground” brands to show that they are “in.”\nPrice: Offering similar value at a lower price is a common way to satisfy the needs of price-sensitive Customer Segments. But low-price Value Propositions have important implications for the rest of a business model. No frills airlines, such as Southwest, easyJet, and Ryanair have designed entire business models specifically to enable low cost air travel. Another example of a price-based Value Proposition can be seen in the Nano, a new car designed and manufactured by the Indian conglomerate Tata. Its surprisingly low price makes the automobile affordable to a whole new segment of the Indian population. Increasingly, free offers are starting to permeate various industries. Free offers range from free newspapers to free e-mail, free mobile phone services, and more (see p. 88 for more on FREE).\nCost reduction: Helping customers reduce costs is an important way to create value. Salesforce.com, for example, sells a hosted Customer Relationship management (CRM) application. This relieves buyers from the expense and trouble of having to buy, install, and manage CRM software themselves.\nRisk reduction: Customers value reducing the risks they incur when purchasing products or services. For a used car buyer, a one-year service guarantee reduces the risk of post-purchase breakdowns and repairs. A service-level guarantee partially reduces the risk undertaken by a purchaser of outsourced IT services.\nAccessibility: Making products and services available to customers who previously lacked access to them is another way to create value. This can result from business model innovation, new technologies, or a combination of both. NetJets, for instance, popularized the concept of fractional private jet ownership. Using an innovative business model, NetJets offers individuals and corporations access to private jets, a service previously unaffordable to most customers. Mutual funds provide another example of value creation through increased accessibility. This innovative financial product made it possible even for those with modest wealth to build diversified investment portfolios.\nConvenience/usability: Making things more convenient or easier to use can create substantial value. With iPod and iTunes, Apple offered customers unprecedented convenience searching, buying, downloading, and listening to digital music. It now dominates the market.\n\n\nKey partners\nKey activities\nValue proposition\nCustomer \nrelationships\nCustomer segment\nKey resources\nCost structure\nRevenue streams\nChannels\nFast, easy, and convenient way to  book trips to see real Kurdish culture\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat can the value proposition be for the tourism agency?\nLet 1-2 people share their thoughts\nGuide them to make sure they have the right idea of what a value proposition is.\nShare the answer we have above.

Can anyone tell us?\nPotential answers:\nCustomer segments are “who it’s for“\nThese are your personas from Ignite\nCustomers comprise the heart of your business model. Without (profitable) customers, your company can not survive for long. However, this can also include non revenue generating segments (if they are necessary for the business model to work)\nE.g. Users of Google’s free search engine are essential to their advertising-based business model, \nYour Customer Segments are the different groups of people or organizations your enterprise aims to reach and serve. \nIn order to better satisfy your customers, you may group them into distinct segments with common needs, jobs-to-get-done, common behaviors, needs, or other attributes. \nYour business model may have one or several large or small Customer Segments. \nYou must make a conscious decision about which segments to serve and which segments to ignore. \nOnce this decision is made, your business model can be carefully designed around a strong understanding of specific customer needs and jobs-to-be-done. \nWe need to think about how we are dealing with this segment compared to another segment. Another segment might value something different, want different relationships, or you might deliver the value in a different way (another channel, for example). \nCustomer groups represent separate segments if: \nTheir needs require and justify a distinct Value Proposition \nThey are reached through different Distribution Channels \nThey require different types of relationships \nThey have a substantially different profitability \nThey are willing to pay for different aspects of the Value Proposition\nExamples:\nMass market\nNiche market (can add a description of that particular market)\nMulti sided (B2B and B2C)\nEtc…\nDepending on time, call on some people in the class and have them share their customer segments:\n\nIf you are having trouble identifying your customer segments, ask yourself the following:\nFor whom are we creating value?\nWho are our most important customers, clients, or users?\n\n\n\n--------\nMore details on different common customer segments. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\n--------\nTypes of Customer Segments: There are different types of Customer Segments that group your customers together. Customer segments can have the following titles:\n\nMass market: Business models focused on mass markets don’t distinguish between different Customer Segments. The Value Propositions, Distribution Channels, and Customer Relationships all focus on one large group of customers with broadly similar needs and problems. This type of business model is often found in the consumer electronics sector.\n\nNiche market: Business models targeting niche markets cater to specific, specialized Customer Segments. The Value Propositions, Distribution Channels, and Customer Relationships are all tailored to the specific requirements of a niche market. Such business models are often found in supplier-buyer relationships. For example, many car part manufacturers depend heavily on purchases from major automobile manufacturers.\n\nSegmented: Some business models distinguish between market segments with slightly different needs and problems. The retail arm of a bank like Credit Suisse, for example, may distinguish between a large group of customers, each possessing assets of up to U.S. $100,000, and a smaller group of affluent clients, each of whose net worth exceeds U.S. $500,000. Both segments have similar but varying needs and problems. This has implications for the other building blocks of Credit Suisse’s business model, such as the Value Proposition, Distribution Channels, Customer Relationships, and Revenue streams. Consider Micro Precision Systems, which specializes in providing outsourced micromechanical design and manufacturing solutions. It serves three different Customer Segments — the watch industry, the medical industry, and the industrial automation sector — and offers each slightly different Value Propositions.\n\nDiversified: An organization with a diversified customer business model serves two unrelated Customer Segments with very different needs and problems. For example, in 2006 Amazon.com decided to diversify its retail business by selling “cloud computing” services: online storage space and on-demand server usage. Thus it started catering to a totally different Customer Segment — Web companies — with a totally different Value Proposition. The strategic rationale behind this diversification can be found in Amazon.com’s powerful IT infrastructure, which can be shared by its retail sales operations and the new cloud computing service unit.\n\nMulti-sided platforms (or multi-sided markets): Some organizations serve two or more interdependent Customer Segments. A credit card company, for example, needs a large base of credit card holders and a large base of merchants who accept those credit cards. Similarly, an enterprise offering a free newspaper needs a large reader base to attract advertisers. On the other hand, it also needs advertisers to finance production and distribution. Both segments are required to make the business model work.\n\n7\n\nKey partners\nKey activities\nValue proposition\nCustomer \nrelationships\nCustomer segment\nKey resources\nCost structure\nRevenue streams\nChannels\nMulti-sided:\n\nTravel agencies, hotels, and restaurants\nYoung adults\nand adventurous solo travelers\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat can the customer segments be for the tourism agency?\nLet 1-2 people share their thoughts\nGuide them to make sure they have the right idea of what customer segments are.\nShare the answer we have above. If it is online, you don’t have to provide an alternative answer. Just build out the BMC together.\n\nTransition to next slide: Now we will focus on the next part, channels.\n\n8\n\nCHANNELS\n<5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat are channels? What are they used for?\nPotential answers: \nChannels (how the organization will market and sell it)\nYour communication, distribution, and sales Channels comprise your company's interface with customers. Your Channels are customer touch points that play an important role in the customer experience. \nYour Channels serve several functions, including:\nRaising awareness among customers about a company's products and services\nHelping customers evaluate a company's Value Proposition\nAllowing customers to purchase specific products and services\nDelivering a Value Proposition to customers\nProviding post-purchase customer support\nExamples:\nWebsite \nApplication\nSocial media\nRetail store\nPartner organizations channels (website, store, etc..)\n\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right channels, ask yourself the following:\nThrough which Channels do our Customer Segments want to be reached?\nHow are we reaching them now? \nHow are our Channels integrated? Which ones work best?\nWhich ones are most cost-efficient? \nHow are we integrating them with customer routines?\n\n\n--------\nMore details on different common customer segments. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\n--------\nTypes of Channels: Finding the right mix of Channels to satisfy how customers want to be reached is crucial in bringing a Value Proposition to market. You can choose between reaching your customers through your own Channels, through partner Channels, or through a mix of both. \n\nOwned Direct: Owned Channels can be an in-house sales force or a Web site, or retail stores owned or operated by the organization. Owned Channels have higher margins, but can be costly to put in place and to operate.\n\nPartner Indirect: Partner Channels are indirect and span a whole range of options, such as wholesale distribution, retail, or partner-owned Web sites. Partner Channels lead to lower margins, but they allow an organization to expand its reach and benefit from partner strengths.\n\n\nKey partners\nKey activities\nValue proposition\nCustomer \nrelationships\nCustomer segment\nKey resources\nCost structure\nRevenue streams\nChannels\nApplication\nStrong SM presence\nPartner support\n\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat can the channels be for the tourism agency?\nLet 1-2 people share their thoughts\nGuide them to make sure they have the right idea of what channels are. Make sure they are linked to the value proposition and customer segments.\nShare the answer we have above. If it is online, you don’t have to provide an alternative answer. Just build out the BMC together.\n\nTransition to next slide: Now we will focus on the next part, customer relationships.\n\n10\n\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\n<5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat are customer relationships? How do you build them? How do you know what type of relationship you should build with your customer segments?\nPotential answers: \nCustomer relationships will determine how the team will support and work with its customer base\nYour company should clarify the type of relationship it wants to establish with each Customer Segment. \nRelationships are established through your different Channels. \nCan change based on customer segment\nIt can aim to acquire customers, retain customers, or boost sales (upselling). \nThe type of Customer Relationships you put in place deeply influence the overall customer experience.\nExamples:\nPersonal, face to face, friendly\nAutomated, self service, little human interaction\nTransactional (short relationships)\nLong-term (long term relationships)\n\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right channels, ask yourself the following:\nWhat type of relationship does each of our Customer Segments expect us to establish and maintain with them?\nWhich ones have we established?\nHow costly are they?\nHow are they integrated with the rest of our business model?\n\n--------\nMore details on different common customer relationship types. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\n--------\nTypes of Customer Relationships: We can distinguish between several types of Customer Relationships, which may co-exist in a company’s relationship with a particular Customer Segment.\n\nTransactional: This means there is no real relationship between the company and the customer. The company interacts with the customer on a transactional basis. A kiosk at an airport, for example, usually doesn’t really establish a relationship with its customers.\nExamples: One time purchases, maybe a random online order, kiosks, convenient stores, etc… In these cases, the customer just wants to buy something and move on. There probably isn’t a need to build a deep relationship with the customer. \n\nLong-term: This means a long-term and maybe even deep relationship is established between the company and the customer. The company interacts with the customer on a recurring basis.\nExamples: This can be banking, maybe a local restaurant, maybe b2b partnerships, etc… In these cases, you need to build relationships with your customers over time. Trust is really important here to keep relationships strong.\n\nPersonal assistance: This relationship is based on human interaction. The customer can communicate with a real customer representative to get help during the sales process or after the purchase is complete. This may happen onsite at the point of sale, through call centers, by e-mail, or through other means.\nExamples: restaurants, store help agents, call centers, etc… In these cases, human interaction is important to the customer, but in order to keep costs down, it can be automated sometimes or one employee might work with a lot of customers.\n\nDedicated personal assistance: This relationship involves dedicating a customer representative specifically to an individual client. It represents the deepest and most intimate type of relationship and normally develops over a long period of time. In private banking services, for example, dedicated bankers serve high net worth individuals. Similar relationships can be found in other businesses in the form of key account managers who maintain personal relationships with important customers.\nExamples: Banking, accountants, consultants, etc… In these cases, clients want a lot of support. It can be more expensive because there is a lot of tailored support from staff.\n\nSelf-service: In this type of relationship, a company maintains no direct relationship with customers. It provides all the necessary means for customers to help themselves.\nExamples: self-service buffets, self service check out lines at stores, kiosks, etc… In these cases, customers might value speed or might want to have a cheaper option (business could cut costs through less staff allowing a cheaper product).\n\nAutomated services: This type of relationship mixes a more sophisticated form of customer self-service with automated processes. Automated services can recognize individual customers and their characteristics, and offer information related to orders or transactions. At their best, automated services can stimulate a personal relationship (e.g. offering book or movie recommendations).\nExamples: Automated recommendations, automated suggestions, chat bots, apps or websites using algorithms to support customers or provide customized services, etc… In these cases, you might be working with a lot of customers, but you don’t have the staff to support them all. These automated services can help provide suggestions to support your customers in a quick and tailored way. \n\nCommunities: Increasingly, companies are utilizing user communities to become more involved with customers/prospects and to facilitate connections between community members. Many companies maintain online communities that allow users to exchange knowledge and solve each other’s problems. Communities can also help companies better understand their customers. Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline launched a private online community when it introduced alli, a new prescription-free weight-loss product. GlaxoSmithKline wanted to increase its understanding of the challenges faced by overweight adults, and thereby learn to better manage customer expectations.\nExamples: Facebook, Instagram, other social media, etc… In these cases, the strength of your following is important. You need a community for this to work. You can also create private communities within your business. This can create a sense of exclusivity.\n\nCo-creation: More companies are going beyond the traditional customer-vendor relationship to co-create value with customers. Amazon.com invites customers to write reviews and thus create value for other book lovers. Some companies engage customers to assist with the design of new and innovative products. Others, such as YouTube.com, solicit customers to create content for public consumption.\nExamples: Youtube (creation of videos), Nike (can create your own shoes), allowing community reviews on products, etc… In these cases, engagement is important. You need a community for this to work. You can also create private communities within your business. This can create a sense of exclusivity.\n\nSwitching costs: Switching costs indicate how easy or how difficult it is for a customer to switch to a different alternative. For example, when a customer of a data storage provider stores all his data in a proprietary format it might be difficult for him to switch to an alternative provider.\nExamples: Facebook and other social media (it is hard to go to a new SM because all your friends have to go too), Amazon Web services (data hosting is stored there, you might lose data by switching to another platform), etc… In these cases, you have a lot to lose by switching to a competitor.

How does it relate to the other parts of BMC?\nPotential answers: \nRevenue streams are how the business/product will make money\nYour Revenue Streams represent the ways your company generates cash from each Customer Segment.\nIt is essential for sustainability!\nYou must ask yourself, what value is each Customer Segment truly willing to pay? \nCan have one or many resources of revenue. \nEach customer segment might have its own revenue strategy. \nEach Revenue Stream may have different pricing mechanisms, such as fixed list prices, bargaining, auctioning, market dependent, volume dependent, or yield management. \nExamples:\nTransactional revenues resulting from one-time customer payments (e.g. a sales), \nRecurring revenues (e.g. a subscription),\nAdvertising\nBrokerage or transaction fees,\nEtc…\n\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right revenue streams, ask yourself the following:\nFor what value are our customers really willing to pay?\nHow would they prefer to pay?\nHow much does each Revenue Stream contribute to overall revenues in terms of percentages of the total?\n\n--------\nMore details on different common revenue streams. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\n--------\nTypes of Revenue Streams: There are several ways to generate Revenue Streams. Some include:\nAsset sale: The most widely understood Revenue Stream derives from selling ownership rights to a physical product. Amazon.com sells books, music, consumer electronics, and more online. Fiat sells automobiles, which buyers are free to drive, resell, or even destroy.\nUsage fee: This Revenue Stream is generated by the use of a particular service. The more a service is used, the more the customer pays. A telecom operator may charge customers for the number of minutes spent on the phone. A hotel charges customers for the number of nights rooms are used. A package delivery service charges customers for the delivery of a parcel from one location to another.\nSubscription fees: This Revenue Stream is generated by selling continuous access to a service. A gym sells its members monthly or yearly subscriptions in exchange for access to its exercise facilities. World of Warcraft Online, a Web-based computer game, allows users to play its online game in exchange for a monthly subscription fee. Nokia’s Comes with Music service gives users access to a music library for a subscription fee.\nLending/Renting/Leasing: This Revenue Stream is created by temporarily granting someone the exclusive right to use a particular asset for a fixed period in return for a fee. For the lender this provides the advantage of recurring revenues. Renters or lessees, on the other hand, enjoy the benefits of incurring expenses for only a limited time rather than bearing the full costs of ownership. Zipcar.com provides a good illustration. The company allows customers to rent cars by the hour in North American cities. Zipcar.com’s service has led many people to decide to rent rather than purchase automobiles.\nLicensing: This Revenue Stream is generated by giving customers permission to use protected intellectual property in exchange for licensing fees. Licensing allows rightsholders to generate revenues from their property without having to manufacture a product or commercialize a service. Licensing is common in the media industry, where content owners retain copyright while selling usage licenses to third parties. Similarly, in technology sectors patentholders grant other companies the right to use a patented technology in return for a license fee.\nBrokerage fees: This Revenue Stream derives from intermediation services performed on behalf of two or more parties. Credit card providers, for example, earn revenues by taking a percentage of the value of each sales transaction executed between credit card merchants and customers. Brokers and real estate agents earn a commission each time they successfully match a buyer and seller.\nAdvertising: This Revenue Stream results from fees for advertising a particular product, service, or brand. Traditionally, the media industry and event organizers relied heavily on revenues from advertising. In recent years other sectors, including software and services, have started relying more heavily on advertising revenues.\n\n\nKey partners\nKey activities\nValue proposition\nCustomer \nrelationships\nCustomer segment\nKey resources\nCost structure\nRevenue streams\nChannels\nConnection/booking fee (hotels)\nAdvertisements (restaurants and shops)\nMerchandise you can buy online\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat are potential revenue streams for the tourism agency be?\nLet 1-2 people share their thoughts\nGuide them to make sure they have the right idea of what revenue streams are. How you make money should be related to the information discussed previously.

If it is online, you don’t have to provide an alternative answer. Just build out the BMC together.\n\nTransition to next slide: Now we will focus on the next part, key activities.\n\n14\n\nKEY ACTIVITIES\n<5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat are key activities? Why is it important to define them? \nPotential answers: \nKey activities are the steps the team must complete to make the business successful\nIf you aren’t thinking about what activities you need to be managing, they might get pushed to the side or ignored\nYour business model calls for a number of Key Activities. These are the most important actions your company must perform to operate successfully. \nKey Activities differ depending on business model type. Your specific industry/business will have different activities than another.\nFor example: \nProduction,\nManufacturing,\nMarketing,\nHR,\nSupply chain management,\nProblem-solving,\nEtc…\n\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right key activities, ask yourself the following:\nWhat do you need to be doing in order to operate?\nWhat Key Activities do our Value Propositions require?\nWhat Key Activities do our Distribution Channels require?\nWhat Key Activities do our Customer Relationships require?\nWhat Key Activities do our Revenue streams require?\nEtc…\n\n--------\nMore details on different common key activities. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\n--------\nTypes of Key Activities: Key Activities can be categorized as follows (based on research by two scholars called Charles B. Stabell and Øystein D. Fjeldstad)\nProduction: These activities relate to designing, manufacturing, and delivering a product in substantial quantities and/or of superior quality. Production activity dominates the business models of manufacturing firms.\nProblem solving: Key Activities of this type relate to coming up with new solutions to individual customer problems. The operations of consultancies, hospitals, and other service organizations are typically dominated by problem-solving activities. Their business models call for activities such as knowledge management and continuous training.\nPlatform/network: Business models designed with a platform as a Key Resource are dominated by platform or network related Key Activities. Networks, matchmaking platforms, software, and even brands can function as a platform. eBay’s business model requires that the company continually develop and maintain its platform: the Web site at eBay.com. Visa’s business model requires activities related to its Visa® credit card transaction platform for merchants, customers, and banks. Microsoft’s business model requires managing the interface between other vendors’ software and its Windows® operating system platform. Key Activities in this category relate to platform management, service provisioning, and platform promotion.\n\nKey partners\nKey activities\nValue proposition\nCustomer \nrelationships\nCustomer segment\nKey resources\nCost structure\nRevenue streams\nChannels\n1.

Make sure they are related to tourism and reflect previously stated points on the BMC. For example, if we said it is an application to connect tour guides and tourists, we wouldn’t have “giving tours” as an activity.\nShare the answer we have above.

Just build out the BMC together.\n\nTransition to next slide: Now we will focus on the next part, key resources.\n\n16\n\nKEY RESOURCES\n<5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat are key resources? How do we get them? \nPotential answers:\nKey resources are the personnel, tools, and budget the team will need access to \nEvery business model requires Key Resources. Your resources allow your enterprise to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and earn revenues. \nDifferent Key Resources are needed depending on the type of business model (some business need a lot of cash on hand while others need a lot of human resources)\nKey resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired from key partners (including investors).\nExamples:\nPhysical resources (tangible assets)\nFinancial resources (cash), \nIntellectual resources\nHuman resources. \n\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right key activities, ask yourself the following:\nWhat Key Resources do our Value Propositions require?\nOur Distribution Channels?\nCustomer Relationships?\nRevenue Streams?\n\n--------\nMore details on different common key resources. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\n--------\nTypes of Key Resources: Key Resources can be categorized as follows:\nPhysical: This category includes physical assets such as manufacturing facilities, buildings, vehicles, machines, systems, point-of-sales systems, and distribution networks. Retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon.com rely heavily on physical resources, which are often capital-intensive. The former has an enormous global network of stores and related logistics infrastructure. The latter has an extensive IT, warehouse, and logistics infrastructure.\nIntellectual Property: Intellectual property resources such as brands, proprietary knowledge, patents and copyrights, partnerships, and customer databases are increasingly important components of a strong business model. Intellectual property resources are difficult to develop but when successfully created may offer substantial value. Consumer goods companies such as Nike and Sony rely heavily on their brand as a Key Resource. Microsoft and SAP depend on software and related intellectual property developed over many years. Qualcomm, a designer and supplier of chipsets for broadband mobile devices, built its business model around patented microchip designs that earn the company substantial licensing fees.\nHuman: Every enterprise requires human resources, but people are particularly prominent in certain business models. For example, human resources are crucial in knowledge-intensive and creative industries. A pharmaceutical company such as Novartis, for example, relies heavily on human resources: its business model is predicated on an army of experienced scientists and a large and skilled sales force.\nFinancial: Some business models call for financial resources and/or financial guarantees, such as cash, lines of credit, or a stock option pool for hiring key employees. Ericsson, the telecom manufacturer, provides an example of financial resource leverage within a business model. Ericsson may opt to borrow funds from banks and capital markets, then use a portion of the proceeds to provide vendor financing to equipment customers, thus ensuring that orders are placed with Ericsson rather than competitors.\n\n\nKey partners\nKey activities\nValue proposition\nCustomer \nrelationships\nCustomer segment\nKey resources\nCost structure\nRevenue streams\nChannels\n1.

Just build out the BMC together.\n\nTransition to next slide: Now we will focus on the next part, key partners.\n\n18\n\nKEY PARTNERS:\nKEY PARTNERS\n<5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat are key partners? Why should we partner? \nPotential answers:\nKey partners (how third parties will fit into the plan)\nCompanies create alliances to optimize their business models, reduce risk, or acquire resources. \nThe Key Partnerships Building Block describes the network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work.\nWhy partner?\nOptimize economies of scale\nReduce risk and uncertainty\nAcquire resources\nFill in gaps or needed knowledge, expertise, or activities\nExamples: We can distinguish between four different types of partnerships: \nStrategic alliances between non-competitors, \nCoopetition: strategic partnerships between competitors, \nJoint ventures to develop new businesses, \nBuyer-supplier relationships to assure reliable supplies.\n\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right key partners, ask yourself the following:\nWho are key people or organizations that you need to work with? \nWho are our key suppliers?\nWhich Key Resources are we acquiring from partners?\nWhich Key Activities do partners perform for us?\nDo you need investment?\n\n--------\nMore details on different common key partners. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\n--------\nTypes of Key Partnerships: It can be useful to distinguish between three motivations for creating partnerships:\nOptimization and economy of scale: The most basic form of partnership or buyer-supplier relationship is designed to optimize the allocation of resources and activities. It is illogical for a company to own all resources or perform every activity by itself. Optimization and economy of scale partnerships are usually formed to reduce costs, and often involve outsourcing or sharing infrastructure.\nReduction of risk and uncertainty: Partnerships can help reduce risk in a competitive environment characterized by uncertainty. It is not unusual for competitors to form a strategic alliance in one area while competing in another. Blu-ray, for example, is an optical disc format jointly developed by a group of the world’s leading consumer electronics, personal computer, and media manufacturers. The group cooperated to bring Blu-ray technology to market, yet individual members compete in selling their own Blu-ray products.\nAcquisition of particular resources and activities: Few companies own all the resources or perform all the activities described by their business models. Rather, they extend their own capabilities by relying on other firms to furnish particular resources or perform certain activities. Such partnerships can be motivated by needs to acquire knowledge, licenses, or access to customers. A mobile phone manufacturer, for example, may license an operating system for its handsets rather than developing one in-house. An insurer may choose to rely on independent brokers to sell its policies rather than develop its own sales force.\n\n\nKey partners\nKey activities\nValue proposition\nCustomer \nrelationships\nCustomer segment\nKey resources\nCost structure\nRevenue streams\nChannels\nLocal hotels\nLocal artisans \nLocal Restaurants\nTravel agencies\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat can the key partners be for the tourism agency?\nLet 1-2 people share their thoughts\nGuide them to make sure they have the right idea of what key partners are.

Just build out the BMC together.\n\nTransition to next slide: Now we will focus on the next part, cost structures.\n\n20\n\nCOST STRUCTURE\n<5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat is a cost structure? How can you describe your cost structure?? \nPotential answers:\nCost structure (what it costs to build the product as well as how to sell and support it)\nYour Cost Structure describes all costs incurred to operate your business model. Creating and delivering value, maintaining Customer Relationships, and generating revenue all incur costs. \nCosts can be calculated relatively easily after defining Key Resources, Key Activities, and Key Partnerships. \nCost structure can change based on the rest of your business model\nSome business models are more cost or value driven than others. This can depend on the desires of customer segments. \nYour cost structure and revenue streams should be compared. Make sure your business activities are bringing in more money than it is spending! If it isn’t, something should change.\nExamples of cost structures:\nCost driven\nValue driven\n\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right cost structure, ask yourself the following:\nWhat are the most important costs inherent in our business model? \nWhich Key Resources are most expensive? \nWhich Key Activities are most expensive?\n\n--------\nMore details on different common cost structures. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\n--------\nTypes of Cost Structure: Naturally enough, costs should be minimized in every business model. But low Cost Structures are more important to some business models than to others. Therefore it can be useful to distinguish between two broad classes of business model Cost Structures: cost-driven and value-driven (many business models fall in between these two extremes):\nCost-driven: Cost-driven business models focus on minimizing costs wherever possible. This approach aims at creating and maintaining the leanest possible Cost Structure, using low price Value Propositions, maximum automation, and extensive outsourcing. No frills airlines, such as Southwest, easyJet, and Ryanair typify cost-driven business models.\nValue-driven: Some companies are less concerned with the cost implications of a particular business model design, and instead focus on value creation. Premium Value Propositions and a high degree of personalized service usually characterize value-driven business models. Luxury hotels, with their lavish facilities and exclusive services, fall into this category.\nCost Structure Attributes: A Cost Structures can have the following attributes:\nEconomies of scale: Cost advantages that a business enjoys as its output expands. Larger companies, for instance, benefit from lower bulk purchase rates. This and other factors cause average cost per unit to fall as output rises.\nEconomies of scope: Cost advantages that a business enjoys due to a larger scope of operations. In a large enterprise, for example, the same marketing activities or Distribution Channels may support multiple products.\nFixed cost: Costs that remain the same despite the volume of goods or services produced. Examples include salaries, rents, and physical manufacturing facilities. Some businesses, such as manufacturing companies, are characterized by a high proportion of fixed costs.\nVariable cost: Costs that vary proportionally with the volume of goods or services produced. Some businesses, such as music festivals, are characterized by a high proportion of variable costs.\n\n\nKey partners\nKey activities\nValue proposition\nCustomer \nrelationships\nCustomer segment\nKey resources\nCost structure\nRevenue streams\nChannels\nCost driven (aims to reduce all costs) \nCost drivers include: Marketing, application maintenance, and HR\n\n2 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat should we include as the cost structure for the tourism agency?\nLet 1-2 people share their thoughts\nGuide them to make sure they have the right idea of what a cost structure is.

This is what it looks like all together. This is a clear snapshot of how the business will work, how it adds value, and how it will be sustainable over time. All on one piece of paper!\n\n30 minutes: Now you will do it for your business:\nSpend the next 20 minutes creating your BMC and applying what we just talked about to your business\nHand out large BMC papers on A1 papers (or digital copies if online)\nEntrepreneurs can leave the room and work where they are comfortable.\n20 minutes: After all the BMCs are hung up, go around and look at the other BMCs in the room.\nGive feedback on your colleagues work \nIs everything clear?\nDo you have any ideas to share with them?\nGive feedback to one another.\nYou can spend time doing this! Don’t rush! Be thoughtful! \n\n23\n\nBUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS\nREALITY\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nWe are now going to look at our BMC and think about the assumptions we are making. Assumptions are what we presume to be true or take it for granted without having any concrete evidence.\n\n24\n\n“A chain is only as strong as its weakest link” \n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWhat do you think about this quote? How does it relate to the BMC?\nThe “weakest” links of a chain are some of the most important ones in the chain because it will determine whether or not the chain breaks or not.\nEach of the components of the Business Model Canvas are like links in a chain. Each part is important and necessary for the business to work. \nSo how do we know which parts of the business are weaker than others? How do we know which component, or link, is the most important to test?\nThe component they should test is the one that is most likely to lead to their business model’s failure.\nLook for weak areas or very critical areas for your business\nIdentify the areas of the business model that are most likely to lead to its failure. We call these the “Riskiest Assumptions”\n\n\nDesirability\n Feasibility\nViability \nGoal\nTHE BUSINESS GOAL\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThere are 3 main reasons that can create a break of your “chain”.\nIf the product is not desirable: Desirability relates to the focus on people; it’s what puts the “human” in human-centered design. If a solution is to be desirable, it has to appeal to the needs, emotions, and behaviors of the people we are designing for.\n\nIf the product is not feasible: Feasibility is about technology. Is your design solution technically possible, or does it depend on a technology that’s yet to be invented (or good enough for regular use)? While we should never base designs on technical specifications, our design solutions need to be practical and implementable without incurring huge costs.\n\nIf the product is not viable: The last test is (commercial) viability: will your design solution work as a business? Is there an appropriate business model behind your solution, or would it collapse after a few years without investor or donor contributions? Design Thinking is not about making a profit, but good design solutions should always be self-sustaining \n\nFor more details:\nhttps://medium.com/innovation-sweet-spot/desirability-feasibility-viability-the-sweet-spot-for-innovation-d7946de2183c\n\n\nVIABILITY\nDESIRABILITY\nFEASIBILITY\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nThese points can be seen on the BMC here.\nIf your business isn’t feasible, desirable, and viable, it will not work.\nSo what we will do now, is identify the weak points in each of these categories.\nOur goal over the next 3 months is to ensure that we have a feasible, desirable, and viable business model.\nIn order to do that, we need to identify the weak points and assumptions we are making.\n\n\nFor my product to succeed, it is necessary that…..\nIDENTIFYING RISKY ASSUMPTIONS\nHotels will sign up on my application\n\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\n\nTravelers will use my app to book online\n\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\n\n\n\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nIdentify the riskiest assumptions for an example business\nLet’s take the BMC we made for the tourism agency.\nWhich are the riskiest assumptions? Write down all answers on the board (we will plot answers on the next slide).\nThink about assumptions you are making about desirability, feasibility, and viability.\nPotential answers can be: \nHotels will sign up on my application\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\nTravelers will use my app to book online\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\nEtc… \nTesting your BMC: https://strategyzer.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/1118563-testing-101-testing-your-business-model-using-str\n\n\nIMPORTANCE OF ASSUMPTION\nDIFFICULTY TO TEST\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nSo once we have our assumptions, we have to test them. In reality, we could have hundreds of assumptions that we are making about our business. That is why we only want to focus on the riskiest ones. In order to gain a focus on what to validate first, we will plot them. \nGo point by point on the assumptions they listed on the previous slide.\nHave entrepreneurs plot the assumptions into one of the four quadrants of the matrix:\nLower-Left: Not important + not difficult. \nLower-Right: Not important + difficult. \nTop-Right: Difficult + Important. \nTop-Left: Important + not difficult. \nAsk, where should you focus your energy on testing?

Business Model Canvas** | KEY RESOURCES (Slides 16-18) | No consideration of resource volatility and supply chain risks | Add bullet point: \"Resource efficiency reduces both costs and supply chain risks\" with example of how resource-efficient businesses weathered COVID supply chain disruptions better | Add risk assessment discussion: \"Which of your key resources are most vulnerable to price volatility, scarcity, or regulation? How could more sustainable alternatives reduce these risks?\" | \"Resource Risk Assessment\" section for prototype worksheet that helps evaluate supply chain resilience |\n| **3. Business Model Canvas** | COST STRUCTURE (Slides 20-22) | Focuses on immediate costs without considering long-term efficiency gains | Add to cost structure slide: \"Energy and material efficiency drives long-term profitability\" with data point: \"Companies with strong sustainability practices demonstrate 18% higher ROI than those with poor ones\" | During cost structure discussion, add exercise: \"Identify three areas where reducing waste or energy use could significantly lower your operating costs\" | \"Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator\" that helps calculate cost savings from sustainability initiatives |\n| **3. Business Model Canvas** | BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS (Slides 24-29) | Fails to identify emerging market, regulatory, and resource risks | Add new category of assumptions to test: \"Resilience Assumptions\" with examples like \"How would a carbon tax affect our profitability?\" or \"What if key material costs increase by 50%?\" | Add scenario planning to assumption testing: \"Consider how climate regulations, resource constraints, or changing consumer values might affect your business model's viability\" | \"Future-Proofing Assessment\" worksheet with sections for regulatory, resource, market, and technology risk scenarios |\n\nThese changes position sustainability not as an ethical add-on but as a core business strategy for risk reduction, competitive advantage, and long-term profitability. The framing emphasizes how sustainable business models can:\n\n1. **Reduce risks** by decreasing dependency on volatile resources and preparing for regulatory changes\n2. **Increase durability** by creating more resilient supply chains and adaptable business models\n3. **Boost profits** through operational efficiencies, premium positioning, and access to growing markets\n\nThe key message throughout these changes is that sustainability drives business success, not just environmental benefits.",

Business Model Canvas** | BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS (Slides 24-29) | Fails to identify emerging market, regulatory, and resource risks | Add new category of assumptions to test: \"Resilience Assumptions\" with examples like \"How would a carbon tax affect our profitability?\" or \"What if key material costs increase by 50%?\" | Add scenario planning to assumption testing: \"Consider how climate regulations, resource constraints, or changing consumer values might affect your business model's viability\" | \"Future-Proofing Assessment\" worksheet with sections for regulatory, resource, market, and technology risk scenarios |\n\nThese changes position sustainability not as an ethical add-on but as a core business strategy for risk reduction, competitive advantage, and long-term profitability. The framing emphasizes how sustainable business models can:\n\n1. **Reduce risks** by decreasing dependency on volatile resources and preparing for regulatory changes\n2. **Increase durability** by creating more resilient supply chains and adaptable business models\n3. **Boost profits** through operational efficiencies, premium positioning, and access to growing markets\n\nThe key message throughout these changes is that sustainability drives business success, not just environmental benefits.",

How are you doing today? \nToday, we are going to continue to work on your Profit and Loss statement. We will focus on your costs and think through all of the expenses your business will face over time. As we did with the revenue model, we will use the finance worksheet as a way to play around with our costs and see where we can afford have higher costs, and see where we will actually need to cut our costs.\n1\n\nBreak down the different types of business costs. \nForecast ongoing business costs.\nBuild out the next step of your P&L statement.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nBreak down the types of costs shown in a profit and loss statement.\nUnderstand all the elements that contribute to your ongoing business costs.\nBuild out the next step of your P&L statement.\n\n2\n\n*https://strategyzer.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/topics/113454-using-our-tools-canvases-methods\nREVENUE STREAMS\nCOST STRUCTURE\nCUSTOMER SEGMENT\nCHANNELS\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nVALUE PROPOSITION\nKEY RESOURCES\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nKEY PARTNERS\nYOUR BUSINESS MODEL\n4 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nReview our location on the BMC\nWe are always coming back here to the BMC.  Last week we took a look at your revenue streams to try and forecast revenues for the next three years, and today we will look at the other side, which are your costs. You can’t run a business without incurring some expenses along the way. You usually need to pay to create and deliver value to your customer segments. We will spend this session breaking down the different types of costs and forecasting those like we did for your revenues. \n\nAsk: Why is it important to have a clear picture of your costs before you start your business?\nPotential answers could be:\nEven if you are making sales and your situation is good, if you can’t control your costs, your profitability or cash flow could be ruined. \nIt is necessary for planning. If you want to hit a certain number of sales, you should think about what you need to do to actually make those sales (and what you need to spend). \nBy laying out your costs, you can think more strategically about new systems or techniques to lower them (maybe through partnerships or new and innovative systems)\n\nProfit and loss\n  Revenue model\n  Cost model\n\nBalance sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nRecap: Last we worked on the revenue model. This week we will work on developing your cost model. After these 2 parts are finished, you will have finished your Profit and Loss statement. Remember, that just because we finished the session and you do the assignment, that doesn’t mean we won’t see this again. As you develop your business strategy and clarify your product and go to market strategy, run numbers on here. You want to keep this updated as you progress with your business. Right now there are a lot of estimations, but as you clarify your business model, these financials will become more and more accurate.\n\nTYPES OF COSTS\n5-10 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nAsk: From what you understand, what are the different types of costs? Can someone give me a few examples\nWrite all answers on the whiteboard or Jamboard. Group answers so that you get categories for COGS, salaries, and SG&A (you can have other groups if necessary). \nPotential answers:\nEntrepreneurs will give a variety of answers, write them all down.\nGroup their answers to highlight the costs below:\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS): These are the direct costs of producing an item sold by a company. This includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the product itself.\nSalaries: This includes your team and staff that you pay on a monthly basis (if you pay them in direct relation to production of your product, it might be considered in the COGS section).\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A): These include additional costs that are not related to the production of what you are selling.\nStart up costs: This is all the money you need to start your business. We did this during Ignite so you should already have it. You should consider the bigger capital expenditures you need to start, but also any operating expenses that will allow your business to run while you are waiting to become profitable.\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX): Direct costs involved in day to day operation. This can include things such as marketing expenses, supplies, salaries, etc. These could be fixed or variable.\nCapital Expenditure: One time purchases that relate to the long term business success (items that will last at least 1 year or longer). This can include things like computers, machines, land, furniture, etc…\nFixed Costs: These are costs that stay the same month to month. Rent for example (you agree on your rent and pay the same amount month to month). \nVariable costs: These are costs that change over time. Production for example (the more you produce, the more expenses you pay)\n\n1 minute: Transition\nToday, we will talk in more detail about COGS, Salaries, and SG&A.  These are the things that will be highlighted in your profit and loss for the most part.\nNext week we will go deeper in your start up costs and apply the capital expenditure vs operating expenditure concepts.\n\n\n\n5\n\nCOGS\n40 minutes: Lecture, brainstorm, demonstration (this includes hidden slides 7-11)\n\nThe first thing we will go over are the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Again COGS are the direct costs of producing an item sold by a company. This includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the product itself. \nSo for example, if you sell T-shirts, you need to calculate the cost of actually producing that item. Whether you are buying it from someone else, or producing it from scratch, these costs have to be accounted for.\n\n\n30 minutes: Brainstorm \nWe will do two examples together on the board (a very simple example and a complex one).\nThe entrepreneurs should lead the conversation and figure out how to calculate the unit economics of the examples (the price of one scoop of ice cream for example) \nThe hidden slides 7-10 are for trainers to go deeper on how to facilitate the discussion for each part of the COGS calculation (keep in mind that the slides are animated so might have a few layers of information).\n\n5 minutes: Example 1 (simple)\nHow do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business? – slide 7\nGive background info on business:\nYou know a tub of ice cream costs you $9 to buy from your supplier\nIt also costs you $1 per container to put your own label on the tub ice cream (this is agreed to with the supplier). \nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell\nAsk: What if you don’t sell ice cream by the tub, you sell it by the scoop?\nAnswer: We need to figure out how many scoops are in 1 tub of ice cream, then divide. \nLet’s say there are 100 scoops of ice cream in a tub\n$10/100 scoops = $1 per scoop\n\n5 minutes Example 2 (advanced): \nThat was easy right? What if you don’t know the price of a tub of ice cream? – Slides 7-11\nAsk: What would you do to calculate the cost of 1 scoop?\nGo through a detailed example of calculating the costs of something from scratch. In hidden slides 7-11 we go through how to calculate the price of 1 scoop of ice cream. The general layout is as follows:\nIdentify what goes into making the item (identify all the supplies/ingredients) –Slide 8\nIdentify the price of everything you buy (that goes into what you are making) – Slide 8\nFigure out how much of each ingredient you use (what you buy vs what you use) – Slides 8 & 9 \nLink unit cost to sales – Slide 10 & 11\n\n10-15 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \n6\n\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nItem\nNormal cost \nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\nDay Tour\n$90.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\nItem\nNormal cost \nBulk order price\nBulk order requirement\nDelivery fee (charged on business)\nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\n$5.00\n30\n$2.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nDay Tour\n$90.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + demonstration\n\nCalculating COGS can be incredibly simple,  or highly complicated. \nIf you have a simpler product and already know how much it costs you can just make a simple chart to highlight how much each unit costs your business. \n\nSimple examples:\nExample: How do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business?\nGive background info on business:\nYou know a tub of ice cream costs you $9 to buy from your supplier\nIt also costs you $1 per container to put your own label on the tub ice cream (this is agreed to with the supplier). \nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell\n\nAnother example: A t-shirt costs you $5 +$2 delivery cost. You would put the sale type as a T-shirt and the unit cost is $7.\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration \nGo onto the financial model and show the simple COGS calculation chart.\nPoint out areas that can add to your COGS such as delivery, bulk orders, maybe you can add something like product customization, etc…\n\nIf you are not calculating any COGS, feel free to remove these rows altogether.\n\n\n7\n\n We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream.\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurement used when making the product)\nPrice\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n(10-15 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nLet’s take the example of an ice cream shop.\nAsk: We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream. There are several ways to do this, so lets think about how we want to approach this.\nHave a discussion on the board to see if the class can figure out how to determine how much a tub of ice cream costs, or even one ice cream cone. Guide the entrepreneurs to calculate this on the whiteboard before showing them the answer.\nManage the flow of the discussion to cover the following points:\nTo make it easier, first let’s see how much it would cost us to make a tub of ice cream. You would never make 1 scoop of ice cream, you make a large amount and then sell the scoops individually. So lets say that in our tub of ice cream, there are 100 scoops.\nFirst figure out the ingredients you need to make this tub of ice cream. Write down all of the ingredients you would need to make ice cream on the white board (it is ok to estimate). \nPotential answers could be:\nSugar\nMilk\nSalt\nOreos\nEtc….\nWhen you buy this ingredient, how much do your buy (1 kilo, 1 package, 100 pieces, etc…). Write that down next to the ingredient itself.\nHow much did you pay for the ingredients? Write that down as well so you can calculate how much you actually spend\nTransition to next slide: Great, the first steps are done, now what do we do? \n\nNote to trainer: We are not ice cream experts, so we are going to stay simple for now. If this was really a business we are working on, we would need to calculate the real costs and know the real ingredients. This is just a simple example so we are making some things up.\nIt is ok, if the group comes up with a different answer from the example shown. \n\n8\n\nBut I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! \nI won’t have accurate costs estimates!\n  COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurment used when making the product)\nPrice\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\n800\n$2.56\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\n5\n$4.00\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\n10\n$1.25\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\n5\n$1.56\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\n20\n$3.00\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\n0.5\n$0.30\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\n$     -\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n100\n$12.00\n(5-10 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6 \n\nSome entrepreneurs might point out “But I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! I won’t have accurate cost estimates!”. Make sure to explain how to accurately calculate COGS considering the fact that they won’t use all of their ingredients.\nMake sure when you write out the quantity you are buying, you convert it to the measurements that you will use when making the ice cream. For example, you buy 1 Kilo of sugar, but you cook with cups, so write it out as 5 cups as well (as you can see in the image). \nThe next step is to write down how much of the ingredient you use to make a tub of ice cream. From all that information, you can find the amount you spend on just the ingredients you use. This means you can use the rest of your ingredients and not miscount your costs.\nIf each tub has about 100 scoops, you can divide the tub price by 100 to get the cost per scoop.\nNow you know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream!\n\nTransition: \nAsk: What do you guys think is the next step? Now that we know how much 1 scoop of ice cream, what do we use that information for?\nWe need to see how much we are spending month to month to produce the ice-cream that we are selling\nMultiply price per scoop by the number of ice cream sales. \nThis is what is known as a variable cost. \n\n\n9\n\n# of ice cream scoops produced\nCALCULATING VARIABLE COSTS\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY \nFEBRUARY\nBranded T-Shirt\n20\nIce cream scoop\n300\n315\nSweet drink\n300\n315\n(10 minutes: Discussion) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nAsk: What do you guys know about variable costs? Have the class share what they know on the topic.\nPotential answers: \nThere are fixed costs and variable costs. \nFixed costs stay the same month to month. Variable costs change.\nIf you produce more, it costs you more. \n\nAsk: If it costs us $.25 for one scoop of ice cream, and we sell 300 scoops in January, how much are the Ice cream related COGS in January?\nAnswer: $74\nAs we increase our ice cream sales, we also increase the COGS related to ice cream.\nIn the financial model, you should link your sales with COGS to calculate your variable costs.\n\n\nAsk: What other things can be variable in your business?\nPotential answers: \nDelivery of your item (each item sold needs to be delivered- you can link this to sales as in COGS calculation)\nDirect labor for your product/service (if not paid a salary)\nIf you offer something (like a gift) with every purchase\nTransportation\nAdvertising\nEtc…\n\nQuestion that might come up: \nHow do we forecast variable costs that aren’t linked to sales?\nWe will approach variable costs in 2 ways. \nWe will link costs to sales. As sales grow, some of your variable costs grow with them\nFor the items that are variable that we can’t link to sales and easily forecast. We are going to estimate how much we would want to spend on those items. For example, although advertising can be variable (you can spend as much as you want on it), we are going to treat it like a fixed cost and set a budget for ourselves and not spend over that amount. \n\n10\n\nCALCULATING COGS\nTOTAL COGS\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nIce Cream Costs\n74\n78\n82\n86\nT-Shirt Costs\n-\n240\n-\n240\nSweet Drink Costs\n834\n876\n919\n965\nTotal COGS\n$74\n$318\n$82\n$326\n(3 minutes: Lecture + demonstration) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nCalculating the actual costs shown on P&L:\nNow based on the unit price of an item, and the amount old, you can easily calculate the actual COGS. \nThis is broken down month to month and can also be broken down product to product.\nThe more detailed you are in your work, the more detailed and accurate the results will be.\nThe COGS will generate automatically into your P&L if you don’t add or remove rows. \nIf you add/remove rows, make sure to look at the formulas to ensure they add up correctly.\nThe trainer can show exactly how this works by doing it on the actual Google sheet.\n11\n\nGross Profit = Revenues - COGS\nGROSS PROFIT\n2018A\n2019A\n2020A\n2021E\n2022E\nREVENUES\nSales\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 120,000\n$ 200,000\nServices\n$ 20,000\n$ 40,000\nOther Income\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 140,000\n$ 240,000\nCOGS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,400\n$ 8,820\n$ 9,261\n$ 9,724\nGROSS PROFIT\n$ 19,000\n$ 36,000\n$ 71,180\n$ 130,739\n$ 230,276\nEXPENSES\nSG&A\n$ 12,000\n$ 12,600\n$ 13,230\n$ 13,892\n$ 14,586\nSalaries\n$ 15,000\n$ 15,750\n$ 16,538\n$ 17,364\n$ 18,233\nOther expenses\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL EXPENSES\n$ 35,000\n$ 36,750\n$ 38,588\n$ 40,517\n$ 42,543\nPROFIT/LOSS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,250\n$ 41,413\n$ 99,483\n$ 197,457\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nTo place us back onto the P&L, let’s see where we are and what we have done so far.\nGo through the P&L statement up until Gross profit\nWe have talked about our revenues.

This means your total revenues – COGS.\nQuiz the group and ask something like:\nIf you made $1,000 selling hats and your hats cost you $200 to make and deliver to your customer, what is your gross profit? \nAnswer: $800\n\nAsk: How many of you need to calculate COGS in one way or another?\nSome people might raise their hands, others might not. \nCOGS won’t be relevant for everyone. In reality, your COGS are only one type of expense. In the next slides, we are going to take a look at how to calculate the other parts (which will be relevant for everyone). \n\nRecap: You need to calculate the COGS for your business (if relevant) in order to get an accurate picture of your expenses, you should understand the unit economics of your business. This is how much it costs you to produce 1 unit of whatever it is that you are selling. \n\n\n\n\n12\n\nSALARIES\n10-15 minutes: Brainstorm + discussion\n\n3 minutes: Lecture\nAs you mentioned previously, another cost that we need to consider are staff salaries. Your team is an essential part of your business, but they can often be costly. You need to evaluate who should be on your team, when to hire them, and how much you need to pay them! These are strategic questions because you usually need staff to create and sell your product, but you don’t want to hire unnecessary people. You can use the finance tool to help plan when the best time to hire employees are. \n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\nWe will do an example together on the board and then I will show you how to apply it on your cost assumptions tab of the financial model.\nThe brainstorm/explanation should be done on a whiteboard or Jamboard. \n\nExample:  Calculating salaries\nAsk: What is the best way to approach figuring out our costs related to salaries?\nStep 1: Figure out who you need to hire\nSome things are obvious. You already know who to hire\nLook at your sales forecast. Who do you need to actually reach that target? Don’t hire someone until you need them\nFind interns and students who could volunteer instead of hiring someone\nTake more responsibilities on yourself\nNote to trainer: We will go over hiring in more detail in the LEAD sessions\nStep 2: Estimate their salary\n\nStep 3: Figure out when you want to hire and how many people\n\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \nPoints to bring up include:\nAs entrepreneurs are answering that question, show them these parts of the model:\nBlue: The job title of the person you need. \nOrange: The salaries for each person. Make sure you write your own salary as well. Put a number that you actually deserve (what is your worth?)!\nMonth to month in orange: The number of that particular employee you will hire for that given month (for example, 1 CEO, 2 interns, etc…). If your salary is too high, remember you don’t have to pay yourself at the beginning or you can take half of your salary (type in .5 in the month to month box – shown in the first row of the second picture under October and November). \n\n\n\n13\n\nPRACTICE\n\nAdd your employees into your financial model!\n15 minutes: Activity\n\n2 minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work on their own model and input information for their salaries. \nWe will not apply the COGS directly because it does not relate to everyone, but this is a good time for them to apply some of the new knowledge onto their business.\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nSet the timer for 8-10 minutes and let entrepreneurs work on their model.\nThe trainer should go around to answer any questions or help when needed. \nTrainers should make sure to point out if they want to hire someone who might not be necessary at this point. You can suggest to hire them maybe in year 2 or 3 (show them on the model how that would work)\n\n\n\nSELLING,  GENERAL, & ADMINISTRATIVE\n15 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nHave a brief discussion on selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&A). These are costs that are not directly related to production or salaries. \nOk, so we are clear on COGS and salaries, now what about all of your other costs? Where do they go? \nWe will put all of your other costs (except for startup costs) under SG&A.\nThe SG&A category can encompass all of your other expenses that we haven’t accounted for yet. \nAsk: What are the other expenses that are left that we still need to account for?\nPotential answers can be:\nRent\nOverhead (ongoing expenses of operating your business)\nAdvertising\nSupplies\nLawyer fees\nAccountant\nUtilities\nEtc…\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDemonstrate how the finance tool works:\nCategories: You have already mentioned a few of the categories that can be listed in here. These can be larger categories broken down into specific expenses. For example, you can see that I have advertising listed here. Instead of just saying $160 will be spent on advertising, you want to think about how you will actually advertise. Think about where your customers are and how you can best reach them. In this case I chose Facebook promotions, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and printed materials. You should think of every expense you will need to pay out over the coming years and write it out. \nMonth to month expenses: You can highlight how much you plan on spending every month for each category. Take a look at your sales targets per month and consider how much you would have to spend to get there. Be as realistic as possible. \nFor example, If you spend $100 on a Facebook advertisement, how many views will that generate? How many people typically look at an ad before converting into a sale? If you are only spending a small amount of money on 1 form of advertising, don’t expect a ton of sales! \nYoY growth: The year over year (YoY) growth box allows you to set a standard growth rate for your expenses. You should assume that you will be spending more on expenses every year because of the rise in prices or because you are spending more as you grow. You can choose to use this method or not depending on the situation of that expense item. \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nAre these fixed or variable costs?\nSome of them are fixed and some of them are variable. Things like rent are fixed all the time. Maybe there is a price increase, but for the most part you know that it will be the same month to month.\nFor some of the others such as advertising, meeting expenses, and so on, these are variable, but if you plan ahead and budget for them, you can treat them as a fixed cost. You can say that you will only spend $100 on _____ per month or something like that. Remember that we want to plan as accurately as possible. \n\n.\n15\n\nPROFIT AND LOSS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nYEAR 3\nSALES\nProducts\n26,276\n72,604\n127,752\nSubscriptions\n6,364\n11,428\n20,523\nTOTAL SALES:\n$ 46,965\n$ 84,032\n$ 148,276\nEXPENSES\nCOGS\n17,333\n29,635\n49,097\nSalaries\n19,700\n49,000\n92,400\nSG&A\n8,820\n12,945\n13,166\nTOTAL EXPENSES:\n$45,853\n$91,580\n$154,663\nNET INCOME:\n$2,622\n$7,548\n$6,387\n5 minutes: Demonstration + discussion\n\nStay on the financial model and show the profit and loss summary tab.\nFinally, now that all the costs are accounted for, you can see the completed P&L.\nShow how it is all linked to that one page. \nIf you look at the P&L summary tab, you can see all your information at a very high level. Again, these numbers should automatically generate for you based on the totals generated from your detailed P&L statement (which are generated from your assumptions). Just make sure that all of the calculations and formulas add up in the detailed profit and loss tab.\n\nAsk: What can you learn from this tab? How can you use the information here to be a better manager?\nPotential answers:\nThis tab can be very insightful for you or anyone else evaluating your financials. \nGet a very clear summary of all the details of where you are doing well and where you are suffering. \nYou can see if your costs/revenues are super high or low. \nFor example, salaries are posing a big problem here. They are so expensive and are growing fast!\nYou can easily see if there is an error somewhere on your financials on this page, you know where to go to solve it or fix the formula\nYou can see your growth and profitability over time. Are you being realistic? Are you over or undervaluing yourself? \nWhen you start to really track information, this can be helpful to help you know where to cut costs or be more efficient. \nIf these numbers are interesting enough, an investor might ask how you plan on doing it, which could lead to a longer conversation with them\nAlternatively, an investor might look at them and be turned off right away.\n\n\n16\n\nPRACTICE\n\nHow can you make this business more profitable?\n45 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nBreak the room into small groups of 3-5 people\nAllow entrepreneurs to go somewhere comfortable to work as a group\nEvery group will get an example P&L statement to work on as a group\nThe P&L statement will not be profitable\nEach group needs to evaluate the statement and make it profitable. You can do whatever you want to make that happen, but remember you are a business that should be accepted by your customers. \nChange things on the revenue and cost assumptions tabs\n\n30 minutes: Activity\nSet the timer for 20 minutes and announce when there is only 10 minutes and 3 minutes left\nThe trainer should go around the groups to answer any questions or help when needed. \n\n10 minutes: Recap\nBring the group back together. \nGo around the room and have groups share their strategy to becoming profitable\nSome potential ways could include:\nRaising prices (note that this action could lead to fewer sales),\nAdjusting salaries (who is hired and how much you pay them),\nRent a cheaper location,\nMaybe you choose to buy in bulk or find a new supplier,\nAdjust marketing tactics to be more affordable and reach more customers (note that this action could lead to more sales)!\nEtc…\n\n\n\nDetermine the costs related to your project:\nCOGS\nSalaries\nSG&A\n\nFinish your P&L by Thursday!\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n19"
