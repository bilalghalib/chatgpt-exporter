      "content": "Here’s a breakdown of the research on suicide among entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs:\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 1. Entrepreneurs & Mental Health  \n- **Higher prevalence of mental health issues**: A survey of 242 entrepreneurs found 49% reported having a mental health condition—30% depression, 29% ADHD, 27% anxiety—which is significantly higher than general population rates (~7% depression) citeturn0search4.  \n- **Suicidal ideation risk**: Some commentators suggest founders experience suicidal thoughts at up to twice the rate of the general population, though robust population-level data are limited citeturn0search0turn0search3.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Self-Employed vs. Standard Employment  \n- **Korean study (2019)**: Among ~24,000 self-employed, including small business owners, they had greater odds of suicidal ideation compared to employees:\n  - Small business owners: OR = 1.25 (95% CI 1.15–1.35)\n  - Larger self-employed: OR = 1.32 (CI 1.09–1.61)\n  - Elevated suicide attempts seen in small-business group: OR = 1.67 (CI 1.11–2.45) citeturn0search2.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Entrepreneurs & Suicide Rates  \n- **Limited direct data**: Few studies directly measure suicide *rates* among entrepreneurs; much relies on self-report or anecdotal cases citeturn0search0turn0search5.  \n- **Business performance link**: One study found a positive association between business performance and suicide rates in individuals aged 15–34 in the U.S., suggesting market and financial pressures may play a role citeturn0search1.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Social Entrepreneurs  \n- **COVID‑19 study in Pakistan (2022)**: Surveyed 840 social entrepreneurs; using PHQ‑9 and GAD‑7:\n  - 64.5% showed mild‑to‑moderate depression\n  - 67.7% showed anxiety symptoms\n  - Notably, about one-third reported **negative suicidal thoughts**, although explicit suicide *rates* weren't measured citeturn0search9.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Group                          | Key Metric                                         | Citation |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Entrepreneurs (general)       | 49% mental health; ~30% depression; suicidal ideation ~2× general population | turn0search4, turn0search0 |\n| Self-employed (Korea)         | OR 1.25–1.32 suicidal ideation; OR 1.67 suicide attempts (small biz) | turn0search2 |\n| Young business performers     | Positive link: business performance ↔ suicide rates | turn0search1 |\n| Social entrepreneurs (Pakistan) | 64.5% depression; 67.7% anxiety; ~33% suicidal ideation | turn0search9 |\n\n---\n\n## 🔎 Further Reading & Noteworthy Papers\n\n1. **Jin‑Young Min et al. (2019)** – *Am. J. Ind. Med.*: \"Differences in suicidal behaviors between self-employed and standardly employed workers\" citeturn0search2.  \n2. **Kim HJ, Min JY, Min KB** (2019) – on health of Korean small business owners citeturn0search2.  \n3. **Pakistan social entrepreneurship study**: Hussain & Li (2022), *Frontiers in Psychiatry*: “Mental Health Survey of Social Entrepreneurs During COVID‑19” citeturn0search9.  \n4. **U.S. study on entrepreneurs aged 15–34** linking business performance to suicide risk citeturn0search1.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Takeaway  \nEntrepreneurs—especially self-employed individuals and social entrepreneurs—face elevated mental health challenges, with significantly higher rates of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and attempts, though national suicide rates remain under-documented. The evidence highlights the need for targeted mental health support in entrepreneurial populations.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like access to the full texts or specific tools/interventions from these studies, just let me know!",
