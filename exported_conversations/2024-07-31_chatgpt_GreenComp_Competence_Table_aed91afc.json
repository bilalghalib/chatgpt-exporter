The European sustainability competence framework\nGreenComp consists of four competence ‘areas’\nthat correspond to the definition of sustainabili-\nty; and the 12 ‘competences’ that, taken together,\nmake up the building blocks of the sustainability\ncompetence for all people.\nThe two dimensions are listed in Table 1. Each com-\npetence is accompanied by a descriptor that best\nrepresents its main aspects.\nTable 1.

However this does\nnot imply a sequence of acquisition nor a hierarchy.\nAll 12 competences are equally important: learners\nare encouraged to develop all of them.\nThe four competence areas are tightly interrelated:\nsustainability as a competence encompasses all\nfour taken together. The 12 sustainability compe-\ntences are also interrelated and interconnected, and\nshould be treated as parts of a whole. While we\nencourage learners to acquire the 12 competenc-\nes, they do not need to acquire the highest level of\nproficiency in all 12, nor have the same proficiency\nacross all of them. Indeed, GreenComp implies that\nsustainability as a competence is made of 12 build-\ning blocks.\nGreenComp: The European sustainability competence framework\n15",

Envisioning sustainable futures | 3.1 Futures literacy       | To envision alternative sustainable futures by imagining and developing scenarios and identifying the steps needed to achieve a preferred sustainable future. |\n|                                 | 3.2 Adaptability            | To manage transitions and challenges in complex sustainability situations and make decisions related to the future in the face of uncertainty, ambiguity, and risk. |\n|                                 | 3.3 Exploratory thinking    | To adopt a relational way of thinking by exploring and linking different disciplines, using creativity and experimentation with novel ideas or methods.  |\n| 4. Acting for sustainability    | 4.1 Political agency        | To navigate the political system, identify political responsibility and accountability for unsustainable behavior, and demand effective policies for sustainability. |\n|                                 | 4.2 Collective action       | To act for change in collaboration with others and actively contribute to improving prospects for the community and the planet.                         |\n|                                 | 4.3 Individual initiative   | To identify own potential for sustainability and to actively contribute to a sustainable future.                                                         |\n```\n\nThis table captures the key elements of the GreenComp framework, organizing the sustainability competences into four main areas with their respective competences and descriptors.",
