  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is applying for an Echoing Green Fellowship to transform their organization Bloom, a nonprofit accelerator they've run for 10 years across 16 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond. After experiencing significant funding challenges and organizational instability due to shifting international development priorities, they're seeking early-stage support to fundamentally reimagine Bloom's model. The user has 1,011 alumni entrepreneurs from their programs and wants to shift from a traditional accelerator-to-investor pipeline toward a solidarity-based community infrastructure.\n\nClaude helped the user develop their grant application by researching critiques of the current social impact ecosystem, particularly drawing on \"Winners Take All\" by Anand Giridharadas and studies showing that larger development interventions often have smaller effects. Together they identified core problems: social enterprises serving communities with thin margins and cultural specificity can't access impact investment, creating a \"funding cliff\" after accelerator programs end. The user shared specific examples like Mary Claire in Cameroon, who innovated a circular economy project turning agricultural waste into tampons but couldn't secure funding despite moving investors to tears.\n\nThe user demonstrated a preference for constructive pushback over flattery, asking Claude to maintain their authentic voice while improving grammar and avoiding AI-generated language patterns like em-dashes. They value building genuine community relationships and material solidarity over abstract concepts, emphasizing their core principle that \"we are stronger together.\" Through iterative drafting, they developed a concrete proposal to pilot a solidarity revenue pool where teams like PsyAI in Jordan and Coursaty in Lebanon (both generating $10k monthly revenue at different seasonal peaks) could pool resources during fat months and draw support during lean periods.\n\nClaude provided critical feedback when the user attempted to design complex investment vehicles, pointing out that pooling teams with small margins doesn't solve the fundamental mismatch between community-serving enterprises and investor return expectations. The user ultimately focused on a simpler 18-month pilot approach: activating their network of 1,011 entrepreneurs, testing mutual aid mechanisms with 5-10 committed teams, and documenting a replicable model for post-accelerator community support that could eventually attract patient capital investors seeking stable, diversified opportunities in proven social enterprises.",

      "content": "The user is asking for help with applying for the Echoing Green Fellowship. They've uploaded the selection criteria document. Let me understand what they're asking:\n\n1. They have an organization called \"Bloom\" (or \"Bloom PM\") that has been around for 10 years\n2. The organization hasn't been able to stabilize, and support structures that kept it afloat are gone\n3. They're considering whether to:\n   - Say the org failed and start a new one, OR\n   - Apply with the existing org but describe it as needing new direction\n4. They want help:\n   - Defining the problem Bloom is trying to solve in the evolved world\n   - Figuring out if their work fits Echoing Green's criteria\n   - Understanding what EG offers (funding, support structure)\n   - Whether they can rely on it financially (does it go to org or individual?)\n\nThe user says I know a lot about Bloom and the work they've been doing. Let me search my conversation history to understand what Bloom is about.\n\nI should use the conversation_search tool to find information about Bloom and the user's work.I'll search through our past conversations to understand Bloom and your work better, then we can think through how to frame this for Echoing Green.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nHmm, no results for that search. Let me try a different search about the user's work and projects.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nStill no results. Let me try searching for what the user has been working on more broadly.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nNo results from any of these searches. It seems like I don't have prior context about Bloom in my conversation history with this user. Since they mentioned they'll add transcripts about their ideas soon, I should be honest about not having that context and work with what they've told me in this message plus the Echoing Green criteria.\n\nLet me also search the web for information about Echoing Green's funding structure since they asked about that.I don't see previous conversations about Bloom in our chat history, so I can't draw on that context yet. But let's work with what you've shared and the criteria document, and I can help you think this through.\n\nFirst, let me find out what Echoing Green actually offers in terms of funding:\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood, I got information about the funding. Let me summarize what I learned:\n\n**Echoing Green Fellowship offers:**\n- $100,000 USD stipend over 18 months\n- The funding goes to the ORGANIZATION, not the individual\n- If selected, you need to either establish a formal organization OR secure a fiscal sponsor\n- They cannot pay individuals directly\n- You must work full-time (40 hours/week) on the work\n- For for-profit orgs, it's a \"recoverable grant\" (needs to be repaid only if the company is valued at >$5M or earns >$2M in revenue with net profit)\n- They seek \"early-stage\" organizations (less than 5 years of full-time operation OR still needing resources to grow and sustain)\n\n**Importantly for the user's situation:**\n- They say \"early stage\" can include orgs that \"still need resources to grow and sustain their operations\"\n- Organizations that DON'T have all of these may still qualify: well-defined program model, strategic plan, basic infrastructure, staffing plan, initial funding sources, board of directors\n- The fact that Bloom has been around 10 years but lost support structures and hasn't stabilized could potentially fit the \"early stage\" definition if framed right\n\nNow let me think about the user's concern. They're essentially asking:\n1. Can they rely on this financially? The answer is: No, not personally. The $100k goes to the organization over 18 months (about $5.5k/month to the org). They'd need to figure out how to pay themselves from that.\n2. Should they apply with the existing org or start fresh? This is strategic - EG seems to value proximity to the problem and lived experience, but they also value \"early stage.\"\n\nLet me think about how to respond constructively. The user likes pushback and constructive criticism, doesn't like flattery, and likes metaphors.Alright, here's what Echoing Green actually offers and the reality check you need:\n\n**The Money Situation:**\nThey give $100,000 over 18 months to the organization - that's roughly $5,500/month to Bloom, not to you personally. They can only pay organizations, not individuals. So you'd need to figure out how to pay yourself a salary from that pot while also covering organizational costs. If you need $3-4k/month to live on, you're left with maybe $2k/month for the actual work. That's... tight.\n\n**The 10-Year Problem:**\nHere's where I'll push back: Framing a 10-year-old organization as \"early stage\" is going to be a tough sell unless you're brutally honest about what happened. Think of it like this - if someone told you their startup was \"still finding product-market fit\" after a decade, you'd wonder what went wrong, right? \n\nHowever, EG says early-stage can include organizations that \"still need resources to grow and sustain their operations\", and they're looking for orgs that don't have all of these: well-defined program model, strategic plan, basic infrastructure, staffing plan, initial funding, active board. If Bloom is missing several of those, you might legitimately qualify.\n\n**The Strategic Question:**\nWithout knowing what Bloom actually does, I can't tell you whether to rebrand or persist. But here's the lens: EG is obsessed with \"proximity to the problem\" and leaders who \"reflect the community they serve.\" If the past 10 years gave you insights that make you more credible and proximate to the issue, then Bloom's history is an asset. If you're pivoting so dramatically that it's essentially a different organization, you're just confusing the story.\n\n**What I need from you to actually help:**\nUpload those transcripts. I need to understand:\n- What problem is Bloom actually trying to solve?\n- Who does it serve?\n- What's your relationship to this community/issue?\n- What did you learn in 10 years that makes your current approach different?\n\nThe EG criteria are all about systems change, equity-centeredness, and innovation. Without knowing Bloom's actual work, I can't tell you if this is even the right fit.\n\nDoes this make sense as a starting point?",

We’re looking for visionary leaders who are committed to upending structural oppression and creating change in their communities so that all people can thrive.\n\nAn organization does not only have to be run by one individual, but as of 2021, only a single applicant is eligible to apply for an Echoing Green Fellowship. If you are running a for-profit or hybrid company, your Fellowship Grant Stipend is provided as a Recoverable Grant. This means repayment may be required only if your business meets one of the following conditions: The company is valued at more than USD 5 million, or · The company earns more than USD 2 million in total revenues and reports a net profit greater than USD 0 at the end of a fiscal year. If your business does not meet either threshold within five years of signing your Fellowship contract, you are not obligated to repay the Recoverable Grant. For more details, please see our Recoverable Grants FAQ. Echoing Green does not have any educational requirements to apply for a Fellowship.\n\nOrganizations still in the idea phase are eligible. You do not need to establish 501(c)(3) status or register your organization before you apply. If selected, Echoing Green can only pay organizations, not individuals, for the Fellowship stipend. You will either need to establish a formal organization or secure a fiscal sponsor on your own. Echoing Green does not support with the registration or fiscal sponsorship process.\n\nTo be eligible for an Echoing Green Fellowship, you must be able to make and act on organizational decisions of your own choosing. If other organizations or entities manage or hold decision-making authority for your proposed organization, you may not be eligible. Organizations that are independent but have fiscal sponsors may be eligible as long as the fiscal sponsor has no authority over the organization’s work and decision making. In your personal assessment, would you describe your organization or idea in the “early stage” of its development and in need of financial and non-financial resources to become sustainable? Echoing Green seeks applicants in need of funding to initiate or scale their organizations. We generally describe early-stage organizations or ideas as those that 1) have operated with full-time staff for less than five years or 2) still need resources to grow and sustain their operations.\n\nOrganizations that already have all of the following in place *may* not qualify as early-stage enough for the Echoing Green Fellowship: a well-defined program model; an initial strategic plan; basic organizational infrastructure (like a bank account, payroll, job descriptions, etc.); a staffing plan; initial funding sources; and a board of directors that meets regularly to manage organizational governance. If you do not have all of these elements in place yet, you may still be in your startup phase and eligible to apply for an Echoing Green Fellowship. Does your organization use lobbying to further its mission or goals? Per the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Echoing Green cannot distribute funds to organizations whose primary purpose is lobbying. Lobbying is defined as activities that seek to support specific political candidates, specific political parties, or urge action on specific legislative bills.",

Let me summarize what I learned:\n\n**Echoing Green Fellowship offers:**\n- $100,000 USD stipend over 18 months\n- The funding goes to the ORGANIZATION, not the individual\n- If selected, you need to either establish a formal organization OR secure a fiscal sponsor\n- They cannot pay individuals directly\n- You must work full-time (40 hours/week) on the work\n- For for-profit orgs, it's a \"recoverable grant\" (needs to be repaid only if the company is valued at >$5M or earns >$2M in revenue with net profit)\n- They seek \"early-stage\" organizations (less than 5 years of full-time operation OR still needing resources to grow and sustain)\n\n**Importantly for the user's situation:**\n- They say \"early stage\" can include orgs that \"still need resources to grow and sustain their operations\"\n- Organizations that DON'T have all of these may still qualify: well-defined program model, strategic plan, basic infrastructure, staffing plan, initial funding sources, board of directors\n- The fact that Bloom has been around 10 years but lost support structures and hasn't stabilized could potentially fit the \"early stage\" definition if framed right\n\nNow let me think about the user's concern. They're essentially asking:\n1. Can they rely on this financially? The answer is: No, not personally. The $100k goes to the organization over 18 months (about $5.5k/month to the org). They'd need to figure out how to pay themselves from that.\n2. Should they apply with the existing org or start fresh? This is strategic - EG seems to value proximity to the problem and lived experience, but they also value \"early stage.\"\n\nLet me think about how to respond constructively. The user likes pushback and constructive criticism, doesn't like flattery, and likes metaphors.",

            "text": "Alright, here's what Echoing Green actually offers and the reality check you need:\n\n**The Money Situation:**\nThey give $100,000 over 18 months to the organization - that's roughly $5,500/month to Bloom, not to you personally. They can only pay organizations, not individuals. So you'd need to figure out how to pay yourself a salary from that pot while also covering organizational costs. If you need $3-4k/month to live on, you're left with maybe $2k/month for the actual work. That's... tight.\n\n**The 10-Year Problem:**\nHere's where I'll push back: Framing a 10-year-old organization as \"early stage\" is going to be a tough sell unless you're brutally honest about what happened. Think of it like this - if someone told you their startup was \"still finding product-market fit\" after a decade, you'd wonder what went wrong, right? \n\nHowever, EG says early-stage can include organizations that \"still need resources to grow and sustain their operations\", and they're looking for orgs that don't have all of these: well-defined program model, strategic plan, basic infrastructure, staffing plan, initial funding, active board. If Bloom is missing several of those, you might legitimately qualify.\n\n**The Strategic Question:**\nWithout knowing what Bloom actually does, I can't tell you whether to rebrand or persist. But here's the lens: EG is obsessed with \"proximity to the problem\" and leaders who \"reflect the community they serve.\" If the past 10 years gave you insights that make you more credible and proximate to the issue, then Bloom's history is an asset. If you're pivoting so dramatically that it's essentially a different organization, you're just confusing the story.\n\n**What I need from you to actually help:**\nUpload those transcripts. I need to understand:\n- What problem is Bloom actually trying to solve?\n- Who does it serve?\n- What's your relationship to this community/issue?\n- What did you learn in 10 years that makes your current approach different?\n\nThe EG criteria are all about systems change, equity-centeredness, and innovation. Without knowing Bloom's actual work, I can't tell you if this is even the right fit.\n\nDoes this make sense as a starting point?",

      "content": "Alright, let me read through this transcript carefully. This is a stream-of-consciousness reflection from someone walking around foraging and thinking through an Echoing Green application. Let me extract the key themes:\n\n**About Bloom:**\n- Founded 2016, worked full-time until 2023 when they had a baby and moved to France\n- Ran accelerator programs in the Middle East/globally\n- Has 10-11 teams from 16 different countries who went through their programs\n- Been working since the Arab Spring\n- Currently taking contracts to support family while doing Bloom part-time\n- Looking for funding to go back to full-time\n\n**The Big Picture Problem/Vision:**\n- Wants to challenge the extractive hyper-specialization model of international development\n- Believes in integrating spirituality/soul into work (mentions Islamic psychology, purification of heart)\n- Wants to help people find their \"right place in contributing to the global symphony\" \n- Calls it \"the learning orchestra\" - learning about yourself inwardly and the world outwardly\n- Concerned about how AI is threatening people who identify with their minds\n- Wants to redefine what work/businesses are for - neighborhood relationships not just transactions\n- Believes we're in a \"dying civilization\" that needs rebirth\n\n**The Specific Problem - Mary Claire Story:**\n- Woman in Cameroon working on menstrual hygiene/tampon access\n- Grew to 8 locations, doing creative cultural work\n- They flew her to Dubai to meet investors\n- NO investors could figure out how to invest - her returns didn't match their expectations\n- This crystallized the question: \"Are there no next-stage opportunities for businesses like Mary Claire's?\"\n- The power center is with investors, not with the entrepreneurs\n\n**The Proposed Solution - Solidarity Fund:**\n- Create a mutual aid/solidarity fund for the 10-11 Bloom teams and potentially others\n- Teams opt in and share revenues when they're revenue-generating\n- Pool resources to smooth out \"choppy\" income streams (especially agriculture projects)\n\n\n- Leverage diverse team cash flows to balance financial risks\n- Provide economic security for entrepreneurs who need stable income\n- Reimagine business as a collaborative ecosystem of mutual support\n- Shift organizational model from competitive ownership to participatory solidarity\n- Develop sustainable funding independent of traditional investment structures\n\nThe application faces significant challenges with Echoing Green's criteria. The spiritual narrative needs strategic repositioning to align with their secular framework. The project's broad conceptual scope requires narrowing to demonstrate a precise, innovative equity-centered approach. Organizational longevity since 2016 complicates the typical fellowship narrative, demanding a compelling reimagining of the core mission and impact potential.\n\nThe solidarity fund represents an intriguing cooperative model with potential systemic economic transformation. However, critical design questions remain unresolved: contribution mechanisms, governance structures, sustainability pathways, and protection against potential free-rider dynamics. Despite these uncertainties, the deep community embeddedness in the Middle East social entrepreneurship ecosystem provides a compelling relational foundation.\n\nThe core innovation lies in challenging \"winner takes all\" investment paradigms by proposing alternative economic collaboration models. Articulating this systems change perspective with clarity and precision becomes paramount for a successful application.\n\nKey strategic considerations include positioning a decade-old organization as early stage, demonstrating meaningful community proximity, and translating their collaborative economic vision into concrete, fundable terms. The challenge is transforming an organic, grassroots approach into a compelling narrative that resonates with early-stage funding criteria.Okay, I've read through your whole transcript. Let me give you some real talk about what you're working with here and where the gaps are.\n\n**The Spiritual Problem:**\nYou're right that framing this as \"people need to bring their souls to work\" is not going to land with Echoing Green. It's too abstract and yeah, they're explicitly not funding faith-based approaches. But here's the thing - you don't actually need to talk about souls to talk about what you're getting at. \n\nThink of it like this: The current development/investment system is like an orchestra where everyone's forced to play the same three notes because that's what the conductor (investors) wants to hear. You're saying \"what if people could actually play their full instruments?\" The soul stuff is your personal why, but the practical problem is about economic systems that only value one narrow definition of success.\n\n**The Real Problem You're Describing:**\nWhen I strip away the philosophy, here's what I'm hearing: The impact investment ecosystem creates a cliff for social entrepreneurs. Accelerators give them 3-6 months of support and training, they start generating revenue and doing real community work, and then... nothing. Because their businesses don't fit the 10x return model that investors need. So you end up with people like Mary Claire who are solving real problems in culturally appropriate ways, creating jobs, serving their communities, but they're stuck in this weird purgatory. Too successful for grant funding, not \"scalable\" enough for investment capital.\n\nThat's actually a systems problem. And it's one Echoing Green might care about.\n\n**The Mary Claire Story is Gold:**\nThis is your hook. Don't bury it. A woman in Cameroon gets tampon dispensers into 8 schools, breaks cultural taboos around menstruation to keep girls in education, creates a sustainable model that works in her context. She gets flown to Dubai to pitch investors. Room full of people crying. Zero funding. Why? Because the system isn't designed for businesses that serve poor communities with products that should be affordable.\n\nThis isn't about Mary Claire failing. It's about the funding system failing entrepreneurs like her.\n\n**The Solidarity Fund Idea:**\nThis is potentially interesting but you need to work out the mechanics before you submit anything. Right now it's pretty vague. Some questions:\n\n- What percentage of revenue do teams commit? \n- Who decides how pooled funds get distributed?\n- What happens if some teams never generate significant revenue?\n- How does this actually de-risk entrepreneurship vs just redistributing the same scarcity?\n- What's your path to bringing in outside capital if it's just 10-11 small teams pooling resources?\n- How is this different from a credit union or cooperative model that already exists?\n\nThe seasonal smoothing thing (agriculture vs education cycles) is clever but is it enough to actually work? Run the numbers.\n\n**The Simpler Alternative (Community Activation):**\nHonestly? This might be the smarter play for an Echoing Green application. Here's why:\n\nYou have 10-11 teams that went through your programs who are still working but struggling. The problem is they're isolated, working in silos, without ongoing support or community infrastructure. The \"innovation\" is that you're building persistent community infrastructure for social entrepreneurs post-accelerator, which basically no one does. Everyone focuses on the 3-month intensive and then ghosts people.\n\nYou could propose:\n- Full-time community manager position\n- Regular convenings/peer learning\n- Shared services (accounting, legal, marketing)\n- Storytelling/visibility work that helps them access opportunities\n- Ecosystem mapping to find collaboration opportunities between teams\n\nThis is more concrete, easier to implement with $100k over 18 months, and still gets at the systems issue (the gap in the support ecosystem). Plus it positions you to test the solidarity fund idea organically - if you're activating the community anyway, you can pilot revenue sharing with interested teams.\n\n**The 10-Year Organization Problem:**\nLook, you need to be honest but strategic here. Bloom has been around since 2016 but has it ever been stable? Do you have:\n- A well-defined program model that you're consistently running? (Sounds like no - you've been figuring it out)\n- An initial strategic plan? (Sounds like you're still searching)\n- Basic organizational infrastructure? (Bank account maybe, but board? Staff? Payroll systems?)\n- A staffing plan? (It's just you, part-time)\n- Initial funding sources? (You're taking contracts to survive)\n- A board of directors? (I'm guessing no?)\n\nIf you don't have most of these things, you legitimately qualify as early stage by EG's definition. The framing is: \"Bloom ran accelerator programs from 2016-2023, but never achieved organizational sustainability. The structure was project-based, dependent on temporary grants. We're now at an inflection point - either formalize and build real infrastructure, or shut down. This fellowship would allow us to finally establish Bloom as a sustainable organization rather than a series of time-bound projects.\"\n\nThat's honest and it fits their criteria.\n\n**The Funding Reality Check:**\nYou already got this but let me make it crystal clear: $100k to the organization over 18 months is $5,555/month. If you need to pay yourself even a modest salary (say $3k/month), you've got $2,555/month for everything else - hiring a part-time community manager, any tools/software, travel to visit teams, convening costs, etc.\n\nIt's doable if you're frugal and if the work genuinely is \"community activation\" rather than \"build a complex financial instrument.\" It's not doable if you're trying to hire staff, develop technology platforms, or create new financial products.\n\n**My Recommendation:**\nGo with the simpler, clearer version:\n\n**Problem:** Social entrepreneurs in the Global South face a support cliff after accelerator programs. They're doing real work in their communities but are isolated, under-resourced, and falling through gaps in the funding ecosystem (too big for grants, too small/wrong model for investment). This leads to burnout, failure of promising initiatives, and wasted investment in training.\n\n**Solution:** Build persistent community infrastructure for Bloom's network of 10-11 social entrepreneurs across 16 countries. Full-time community manager who facilitates peer learning, shared services, visibility/storytelling, and tests new solidarity economy models like revenue pooling. Transform Bloom from a program into a community.\n\n**Innovation:** Most accelerators treat entrepreneurs as individual units to be \"accelerated\" and then abandoned. We're building ongoing collective infrastructure based on mutual aid and solidarity principles rather than competition for scarce funding.\n\n**Systems Change:** This challenges the dominant model of social entrepreneurship support (short-term interventions focused on making ventures investor-ready) and creates an alternative based on community resilience and collective strength.\n\nThen you can mention that longer-term, you're exploring solidarity economy models like revenue sharing, but the immediate work is community activation.\n\nThis is achievable with the money they're giving you, it's concrete enough to be credible, it's innovative enough to be interesting, and it still gets at your bigger vision without requiring you to solve capitalism in 18 months.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this framing feel right or am I missing something about what you actually want to do?",

            "thinking": "Alright, let me read through this transcript carefully. This is a stream-of-consciousness reflection from someone walking around foraging and thinking through an Echoing Green application. Let me extract the key themes:\n\n**About Bloom:**\n- Founded 2016, worked full-time until 2023 when they had a baby and moved to France\n- Ran accelerator programs in the Middle East/globally\n- Has 10-11 teams from 16 different countries who went through their programs\n- Been working since the Arab Spring\n- Currently taking contracts to support family while doing Bloom part-time\n- Looking for funding to go back to full-time\n\n**The Big Picture Problem/Vision:**\n- Wants to challenge the extractive hyper-specialization model of international development\n- Believes in integrating spirituality/soul into work (mentions Islamic psychology, purification of heart)\n- Wants to help people find their \"right place in contributing to the global symphony\" \n- Calls it \"the learning orchestra\" - learning about yourself inwardly and the world outwardly\n- Concerned about how AI is threatening people who identify with their minds\n- Wants to redefine what work/businesses are for - neighborhood relationships not just transactions\n- Believes we're in a \"dying civilization\" that needs rebirth\n\n**The Specific Problem - Mary Claire Story:**\n- Woman in Cameroon working on menstrual hygiene/tampon access\n- Grew to 8 locations, doing creative cultural work\n- They flew her to Dubai to meet investors\n- NO investors could figure out how to invest - her returns didn't match their expectations\n- This crystallized the question: \"Are there no next-stage opportunities for businesses like Mary Claire's?\"\n- The power center is with investors, not with the entrepreneurs\n\n**The Proposed Solution - Solidarity Fund:**\n- Create a mutual aid/solidarity fund for the 10-11 Bloom teams and potentially others\n- Teams opt in and share revenues when they're revenue-generating\n- Pool resources to smooth out \"choppy\" income streams (especially agriculture projects)\n\n\n- Leverage diverse team cash flows to balance financial risks\n- Provide economic security for entrepreneurs who need stable income\n- Reimagine business as a collaborative ecosystem of mutual support\n- Shift organizational model from competitive ownership to participatory solidarity\n- Develop sustainable funding independent of traditional investment structures\n\nThe application faces significant challenges with Echoing Green's criteria. The spiritual narrative needs strategic repositioning to align with their secular framework. The project's broad conceptual scope requires narrowing to demonstrate a precise, innovative equity-centered approach. Organizational longevity since 2016 complicates the typical fellowship narrative, demanding a compelling reimagining of the core mission and impact potential.\n\nThe solidarity fund represents an intriguing cooperative model with potential systemic economic transformation. However, critical design questions remain unresolved: contribution mechanisms, governance structures, sustainability pathways, and protection against potential free-rider dynamics. Despite these uncertainties, the deep community embeddedness in the Middle East social entrepreneurship ecosystem provides a compelling relational foundation.\n\nThe core innovation lies in challenging \"winner takes all\" investment paradigms by proposing alternative economic collaboration models. Articulating this systems change perspective with clarity and precision becomes paramount for a successful application.\n\nKey strategic considerations include positioning a decade-old organization as early stage, demonstrating meaningful community proximity, and translating their collaborative economic vision into concrete, fundable terms. The challenge is transforming an organic, grassroots approach into a compelling narrative that resonates with early-stage funding criteria.",

Arguments for \"1 million millionaires vs 100 billionaires\" \n6. Concrete problems Bloom teams face\n7. Possible solutions beyond just the two they mentioned\n8. How to frame this for Echoing Green\n\nLet me write this up in their voice - casual, thoughtful, avoiding AI tells.Alright, I've got the research. Let me break down what I found and help you build a coherent argument for why solidarity models matter and why the current impact investing system is broken for enterprises like yours.\n\n**The Winners Take All Problem:**\n\nGiridharadas's core argument is that business elites are taking over the work of changing the world, but they may be protecting the very system that's at the root of the problems they claim to solve. Here's the key insight that applies to your work: The \"Even\" app example - a VC-backed solution that charges people $260/year to smooth out their unpredictable income caused by corporate shift scheduling. Instead of fixing the labor practices that create income volatility, investors profit from helping poor people cope with it.\n\nThis is exactly what's happening to your teams. The system creates the problem (lack of funding infrastructure for social enterprises that serve the poor), then offers market-based \"solutions\" (impact investors demanding 10x returns) that don't actually solve anything for people like Mary Claire.\n\n**Why Scale-At-All-Costs Breaks Social Enterprises:**\n\nHere's your coherent argument: The pressure to scale forces social enterprises to optimize for investor returns rather than community impact. Think of it like this - when you're baking bread for your neighborhood, you know exactly who needs gluten-free, who likes it crusty, whose kid has a nut allergy. You're embedded in relationships. But if investors push you to become \"the Starbucks of bread,\" you have to standardize everything, cut costs, maximize efficiency, and suddenly you're just another extractive business that happens to use \"artisan\" in its marketing.\n\nResearch from Mulago Foundation found that very few solutions that meet fundamental needs of the poor will get you your money back - scalable rural livelihoods, basic health care, basic education, clean water, with very few exceptions you don't make money off this stuff.\n\nYour teams aren't failing. The funding model is failing them. Mary Claire's tampon dispensers in 8 schools in Cameroon IS scale - just not the kind that generates investor returns. She's solving a real problem in a culturally appropriate way that keeps girls in school. But because her margins are thin and her market is poor women, she's uninvestable by conventional standards.\n\n**The Accelerator Treadmill:**\n\nYou nailed this in your transcript. Small and relatively new social enterprises fail to meet impact investor requirements because they can't demonstrate healthy financial track records, realistic projections, and strategies to scale. So what do they do? They go from one accelerator to the next, not because they need more training, but because they need that next $5k-10k stipend to survive. It's like telling someone \"we'll teach you to fish\" but then never letting them fish, just sending them to more fishing seminars.\n\nThe whole model is schizophrenic - you're asking people in precarious situations to take risks, innovate, fail fast, but then abandoning them right when they start generating revenue because they're \"too successful\" for grants but not \"scalable enough\" for investment.\n\n**Why 1 Million Millionaires > 100 Billionaires:**\n\nHere's your argument: Wealth distribution is about power distribution. One hundred billionaires means 100 people making decisions that affect billions. One million people with modest wealth means a million decision-makers embedded in a million communities, each with local knowledge and accountability to the people around them.\n\nLook at the cooperative model - Mondragon Corporation in Spain is a federation of worker-owned cooperatives spanning industry, finance, education, and retail, fostering democratic decision-making and profit-sharing. They've created thousands of good jobs and built community wealth without needing to become a unicorn or exit to private equity.\n\nOr credit unions - they're not trying to be Bank of America. They're trying to serve their members. And globally, the largest cooperatives generate about $2.2 trillion in turnover and employ about 10 percent of the world's employed population.\n\nThe scale is there, it's just distributed differently. It's horizontal rather than vertical. It's a forest, not a skyscraper.\n\n**The Real Problems Your Teams Face:**\n\nBased on the research and your transcript, here are the specific systemic issues:\n\n1. **The Funding Cliff**: After accelerators, organizations face a support gap - too big for grants, too small or wrong model for investment capital. This is where Mary Claire is stuck.\n\n2. **Misaligned Metrics**: Impact investors' three most important screening criteria are authenticity of founding team, importance of societal problem, and financial sustainability, with equity investors placing higher value on large-scale implementation. Notice what's missing? Cultural appropriateness, community embeddedness, relational depth.\n\n3. **The Double Bind**: Organizations serving the poorest communities have to keep prices low, which means thin margins. Thin margins mean slow growth. Slow growth means uninvestable. So the people who most need entrepreneurial solutions are served by organizations that can't access capital.\n\n4. **Mission Drift Pressure**: Social entrepreneurs fear mission drift when seeking funds from impact investors. Your teams know that if they chase investor money, they'll have to change what they do and who they serve.\n\n5. **Geographic Bias**: The whole ecosystem is designed for deals that can be monitored from Silicon Valley or London. If you're working in Cameroon or Lebanon, good luck getting investors to visit, understand your context, or stick around through the messy middle.\n\n**Alternative Solutions Beyond Your Two:**\n\nYou mentioned two possibilities (Amazon marketplace for Bloom teams, and solidarity fund). Here are three more to consider:\n\n**Solution 3: Mutual Credit System**  \nInstead of pooling revenue, create a time-banking or mutual credit system where teams can trade services and support without money changing hands. The Lebanese team building AI for people with disabilities could provide tech consulting to Mary Claire's team, who could offer workshops on community engagement to another team, etc. You'd be the clearinghouse that tracks and facilitates these exchanges. This builds interdependence without requiring teams to share revenues they need to survive.\n\n**Solution 4: Collective Bargaining for Services**  \nBloom negotiates bulk rates for services all your teams need - accounting, legal, web hosting, marketing, insurance. You become like Namaste Solar's purchasing cooperative: They created Amicus Solar, a purchasing co-op that allows small solar utilities across North America to buy equipment together, dramatically lowering costs. The 18-month grant funds you to negotiate these deals and manage the shared services platform.\n\n**Solution 5: Community Investment Fund with Graduated Returns**  \nInstead of traditional investors demanding market rates, create a fund where \"investors\" are actually community members, Bloom alumni, and solidarity-minded individuals who accept returns tied to community outcomes rather than financial multiples. Teams pay back based on what they can afford, when they can afford it. You're essentially creating a sharia-compliant or gift economy investment vehicle. The EG money helps you pilot this with your 10-11 teams, document what works, and create a model others can replicate.\n\n**Framing for Echoing Green:**\n\nHere's how you package this:\n\n**Problem**: The social impact ecosystem has created a valley of death for enterprises that succeed at community impact but don't fit investor-return models. Accelerators train entrepreneurs, then abandon them to an investment landscape that demands they either scale like tech startups or die. This is especially acute for entrepreneurs in the Global South serving the poorest communities, where thin margins and cultural embeddedness are features, not bugs.\n\n**Root Cause**: The impact investing field has imported Silicon Valley's \"scale or fail\" logic without questioning whether that model serves the communities we claim to help. We've created a system where investors hope to make millions by asking those on the edge of poverty to solve problems caused by the profit-maximizing choices of wealthy corporations.\n\n**Your Solution**: Build the missing infrastructure - persistent community support for Bloom's network of 10-11 social entrepreneurs across 16 countries. Full-time community activation that provides peer learning, shared services, visibility/storytelling, and pilots solidarity economy models like resource pooling or mutual credit. Transform Bloom from a program that abandons teams after 3 months to a community that supports them for the long haul.\n\n**Innovation**: Most support organizations treat social enterprises as individual units competing for scarce funding. You're building collective infrastructure based on solidarity economy principles - the idea that we're stronger together than apart, and that success doesn't require someone else to fail.\n\n**Systems Change**: This challenges the dominant \"winners take all\" model of social entrepreneurship support and creates an alternative based on mutual aid, distributed power, and community resilience. Instead of trying to create the next Ashoka Fellow or TED speaker, you're building a federation of enterprises that support each other, pool resources, and prove that horizontal scale (many small successes) can rival vertical scale (one big winner).\n\n**Outcomes for EG Application:**\n- X number of enterprises sustained/grown over 18 months\n- X dollar value of shared services negotiated\n- X cross-team collaborations facilitated  \n- Pilot solidarity fund with Y teams participating\n- Case studies/stories published to demonstrate alternative model\n- Blueprint for community-based support infrastructure that others can replicate\n\n**Why This Matters Now**: Post-COVID, post-Gaza war, as funding priorities shift and USAID money dries up, the embers of the Arab Spring - the entrepreneurs who stuck around - need new infrastructure. They've proven their commitment. Now they need community, not just capital.\n\nDoes this help?

                "text": "In Winners Take All, writer Anand Giridharadas calls out the hypocrisies of philanthropists. ... This is an exciting time for social innovation. Billions of dollars are flowing into philanthropy, market-driven solutions and social entrepreneurship are flourishing, and social impact consulting and impact investing have become established professions. Yet, in Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World, Anand Giridharadas, a former New York Times foreign correspondent, explains why we should not be so quick to celebrate these advances. “Business elites are taking over the work of changing the world,” Giridharadas observes. “Many believe they are changing the world when they may instead—or also—be protecting a system that is at the root of the problems they wish to solve.” · Giridharadas uncovers the internal contradictions of those who work for social change from positions of privilege and wealth.\n\nIn my own experience, there is a better answer to the systemic problem that Giridharadas exposes. Approaches such as cross-sector coalitions using the collective impact framework, “positive deviance” problem-solving strategies, and human-centered design all bring the insights of those we hope to help to those who have the power to make change in ways that circumvent at least some of Giridharadas’ concerns. Besides, we must acknowledge that activist mega-donors from Silicon Valley, global corporations, social entrepreneurs, strategy consultants, and impact investors have brought dynamic and powerful new ways of achieving social impact. It would be an immense loss if we completely rejected the innovations they have brought.\n\nAs for market-driven solutions, Giridharadas interviews Silicon Valley’s “rebel-kings” of venture capital—who are ready to disrupt any system other than their own engines of wealth creation. Consider the example of Even, a VC-backed app designed for the millions of people with unpredictable incomes due to erratic shift schedules. For an annual fee of $260, the app calculates a person’s average earnings and reserves any excess earnings for the weeks when they earn less. Even is helpful when it comes to managing unpredictable cash flow, although it doesn’t solve other problems caused by erratic work schedules, such as scrambling to find last-minute childcare. Yet, isn’t something wrong when investors hope to make millions by asking those on the edge of poverty to spend their own money to fix a problem caused by the profit-maximizing choices of wealthy corporations?\n\nIt is an important book that challenges those of us working for social change within existing systems of power to consider whether we are inadvertently perpetuating the problems we seek to solve. It is also a very personal challenge to me, as I represent the very type of person who so worries Giridharadas: I am a former venture capitalist, cofounder of a social impact consulting firm, and a proponent of for-profit solutions to social problems. From my perspective, it is a highly engaging yet sobering experience to read this book, and it imparts new insights into the limitations and compromises inherent in the way I and many of my friends and colleagues have chosen to work for social progress. If this book were an uninformed diatribe against capitalism, it would be easy to dismiss. But Giridharadas understands both sides of these issues. He is a former McKinsey consultant who once embraced the approaches he now rejects.",

Giridharadas uses the term ‘Elite Charade’ to describe a range of activities led by rich, powerful people designed to tackle social problems in ways that – in the author’s view – avoid any challenge to their own wealth and power. The book challenges business leaders such as Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg for trying to make the world a better place through philanthropy while, as Giridharadas sees it, making the world worse through his core business activity: “Zuckerberg wants to cure diseases but his business is his plague.” · Unsurprisingly, impact investors are among those singled out for criticism in the book and Alice Millest, of the Europe\n\nThere were differing views around whether or not it would be better for wealthy individuals to pay more tax rather than put money into social investment.

It was thought this could include measuring the impact of mainstream businesses or creating a takeover fund to take private businesses in the social sector. While not explicitly stated, the underlying conclusion seemed to be that social investors shared many of Giridharadas’s concerns – but felt that, with a combination of pragmatism and a strong focus on social impact, it was possible to find ways to repurpose some wealth and power for social good.",

We are urged to refrain from criticism of philanthropic motives and priorities for fear that ...\n\nAnand Giridharadas’ book, Winners Take All – The Elite Charade of Changing the World, has drawn so much comment that any review at this point seems both superfluous and tardy. Nonetheless, for those who’d appreciate a detailed account of the book’s highlights, here’s one. At its core, Winners Take All seeks to expose the hazards and consequences of the Market World mindset that Giridharadas sees as pervading philanthropy, especially giving by the ultra-wealthy, especially in the USA. Coupled with the win-win premise, that believes it is feasible for givers, recipients and society at large to all benefit simultaneously from acts of supposed altruism, prevents any examination or criticism of the sources of the benefactors’ wealth or the means by which it is accumulated. ‘Win-win-ism’ requires one to first, focus on the victim, not the perpetrator, then to abjure the political for the personal and, finally, to propose constructive action.\n\nMuch of the criticism of Winners Take All boils down to “not all philanthropy”, juxtaposing its many positive consequences, and questioning what alternative means exist to serve pressing needs. We are urged to refrain from criticism of philanthropic motives and priorities for fear that the criticism will deter giving. Critics are urged to instead focus their attention on the 90% of the wealthy who are not philanthropic. Giridharadas clarifies, comparing his critique with questioning monarchy as a system even though every king does not administer his kingdom poorly. “It is to say”, he says, “that it does not matter what kind of job the king is doing.\n\nThis mindset, promoted at numerous global gatherings of powerful elites, requires the substitution, Giridharadas points out, of ‘public intellectuals’ by ‘thought leaders.’ Exemplified by speakers at TED talks, these are ‘congenial to plutocrats’ and ‘know one big thing that they believe will change the world.’ They are ‘optimists’, Giridharadas quotes Daniel Drezner as describing, ‘telling uplifting stories’ who ‘go easy on the powerful,’ emphasising ‘hopeful solutions over systemic change.’ Public intellectuals, Drezner points out by contrast, are ‘wide-ranging critics and foes of power, staying aloof from market, society and state, arguing with each other in books and magazines and posing a genuine threat to the winners’ values of ‘disruption, self-empowerment, and entrepreneurial ability.’ ‘For every thought leader with advice on how to build a career in a merciless new economy, there are many less heard critics aspiring to make the economy less merciless,’ who will not be invited ",

Probing the lives of McKinsey…\n\nWinners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World by Anand Giridharadas Penguin Random House, 2018 · “Change lives. Change organizations. Change the world.” Such is the bar the Stanford Graduate School of Business holds for its students. Its 2018 MBA graduates began to change the world by earning a median starting salary of $142,000 (and a median signing bonus of $25,000), according to a year-end press release, through careers in technology, finance, and consulting. And “yet their career choices were not about chasing the money.” They were, instead, about “social impact” as much as they were about the prospect of making massive amounts of money, insofar as those goals have become one and the same in the 21st century. So argues Anand Giridharadas in Winners Take All, a no-holds-barred critique of a new generation of predatory elites and their do-good-by-doing-well approach to social ills.\n\nIt is none other than these same elites who have lobbied for privatization, deregulation, and tax breaks that have depleted public coffers, for instance, or who have rationalized layoffs, low wages, and uncertain working hours for the sake of optimization; who have argued in high-profile op-eds that the wicked problems of the 21st century are too complex for government to resolve, or who have co-opted the ideals of collectives, social movements, and political protest with the language of apps, networks, and markets. Take Even, a start-up that offers to smooth the incomes of those living “paycheck to paycheck” by charging a small fee for an app-based service that saves away wages on good months and supplements bad months with those savings. Not welfare, minimum wage, bargaining power, housing policy, or health care reform; Even is what the best and brightest are investing in today. Changing the world, as Giridharadas reminds us, is a fundamentally public, political business.\n\nAnd those elites are us, are Giridharadas — a public intellectual just as steeped in the world of the Aspen Institute, McKinsey, and speaker fees as those he indicts, as he acknowledges at the very end of his trenchant book — are me, a Stanford graduate student. We in the knowledge economy have too often allowed ourselves to substitute the public good for private goods in the ideas we promote, to forget trade-offs for win-wins, to replace the democratic will with the best intentions of those who swap PowerPoints behind the closed doors of boardrooms and invite-only conferences. The question is what we are going to do about it: make the world even more suited to our own ends, extracting wealth while heralding our own beneficence; or invest anew in the public foundation of all our wealth, knowledge, good will, and democracy — even, and perhaps especially, if it leaves us alone a little worse off.",

Is this in part because we have replaced social democracy with social entrepreneurship? Anand Giridharadas: I think in part, but I think it&#x27;s bigger than that. I think the story I tell in Winners Take All is that there has been over the last 30, 40 years a massive cultural project prosecuted by the richest and most powerful people and the biggest corporations and the biggest fortunes to sell us on the idea that government is bad, regulation is bad, taxes are \n\nTech billionaires are using their immense wealth to shape the future by lobbying in Washington — but also by using their fortunes for philanthropy. In this episode, we look at the important role that taxation plays in limiting the spread of plutocracy.\n\nDavid Skok: … We talk about venture capital. Venture capital is just about telling a story so you get more money. As someone who's raised money recently, I can tell you that, it's all about what is the story that you're going to tell that sounds compelling so you can get more capital. Well that capital, those venture capital firms, they're beholden to their own pension funds or whomever else, institutional investors that have put money in on their behalf. And so when we think about the tech companies and the role of Chris Sacca or even Mark Zuckerberg, are they not just small peas in a much larger game here that is, the BlackRocks of the world and the CPPIBs of the world. Anand Giridharadas: Yeah, I mean I don't think Winners Take All is a book about individuals. I think it's a book about a system and it tells the stories of individuals to try to illustrate and illuminate a system.\n\nDavid Skok: Today, we're talking to Anand Giridharadas. Anand is someone who you wouldn't necessarily expect to show up in a podcast about Big Tech, but we brought him in because some of the issues he's covering on the high level really do impact the way technology is used in our society and the way governments approach technology. Taylor Owen: Yeah, that's right. And a central tension that Anand brings out is this disconnect between the rising power and influence of the technology platforms that we've been talking a lot about on this show and the traditional mandates of governments. It used to be that we relied on democratic institutions and democratic governments to solve a lot of these social problems to do these big things. But what Anand's pointing out is that increasingly we are devolving this responsibility to a small number of companies and billionaires that lead them.\n\nFollowing a conversation with former New York Times columnist Anand Giridharadas, Taylor Owen considers the impact that private funding has on social democracy.",

                "text": "In his latest book Anand Giridharadas examines the power of elite changemakers and their impact on our world\n\nEvery once in a while a book comes along that really gives me pause, causing me to question assumptions and giving my worldview a serious shake. Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World is one of those books. The questions and issues raised in the book weren’t necessarily new – some I had been contemplating myself – but the in-depth exploration author Ananad Giridharadas offers infused those issues with newfound clarity and credibility that make it now difficult to see things any other way. To listen to the podcast interview with author Anand Giridharadas click here ...\n\nIn one chapter Giridharadas takes a look at Silicon Valley’s unique approach to social change. Theoretically, technology has the potential to equalize, to level the playing field, to democratize. But it doesn’t always work that way. We meet Jane Leibrock who worked at Even, a company with a well-meaning mission – to stabilize the income of a growing number of Americans experiencing volatility. The Silicon-valley solution was of course an app. For a fee, the app would help people stabilize their cash flow by topping up their funds when needed and taking a bigger piece when they didn’t. The thinking was social challenges could be best tackled while building a business. Win-win. Except it’s not. When Leibrock when out to meet with prospective customers – folks that Silicon Valley seldom interacted with otherwise – the wake-up call was intense.\n\nIn another chapter, Giridharadas looks at the rise of elite conferences focused on solving global challenges (particularly the slew of them scheduled during UN week in New York) that bring together like-minded MarketWorld participants and panelists. Again, their heart may be in the right place but, not only are they far removed from those they’re trying to help, one need only look at the agenda of each conference and the panelists chosen to see that their view of social change is limited to a well-preserved paradigm (and let’s be honest most conferences price the average person out of their affairs, ensuring the conversation is restricted to the select few). Seldom will you see panelists at these conferences dispute each other’s opinions, question the status quo. And for those who dismiss these conversations as benign, with little influence on public policy or politics, think again.\n\nLikewise, Giridharadas addresses the rise of thought leaders, well-paid, highly sought-after, many of whom end up speakers at these elite conferences and venues like TED. To be successful as a thought leader, Giridharadas puts forth the idea that you must follow certain rules: don’t talk about root causes of issues or fundamental systems change, offer hope and actionable insight – and don’t ever be political. With these thought leaders setting the stage for how we feel about social change, how can the status quo be anything but maintained? Problem is if we don’t address root causes of issues, such as income inequality, social inequity and power imbalances, how can we ever tackle them head-on? On a positive note, Giridharadas does highlight a number of elites who are starting to question these realities. Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, for example, caused a stir when he wrote about the need to reduce inequality (as opposed to the less threatening focus on poverty reduct",

                "text": "In this excerpt from Winners Take All, Anand Giridharadas sheds light on the ‘Davos for the social do-good set’, and how a gathering for the global elite aimed to change the world. In January 2005, on a stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, one of the original conferences on the MarketWorld circuit, where corporate types paid vast sums of money to mingle with polit­ical leaders and others of similar social position, Clinton announced the Clinton Global Initiative. It would, he said, be like Davos, except it would require the rich and powerful people it brought together to commit, as a condition of showing up, to tangible projects for the global good.\n\nAn insider's trenchant investigation of how the global elite's efforts to \"change the world\" preserve the status quo and obscure their culpability · Former New York Times columnist Anand Giridharadas takes us into the inner sanctums of a new gilded age, where the rich and powerful fight for equality and justice any way they can - except ways that threaten the social order and their position atop it. We see how they rebrand themselves as saviours of the poor; how they lavishly reward \"thought leaders\" who redefine \"change\" in winner-friendly ways; and how they constantly seek to do more good, but never less harm. But why should our gravest problems be solved by the unelected upper crust instead of the public institutions it erodes by lobbying and dodging taxes? Rather than rely on scraps from the winners, Giridharadas argues that we must take on the gruelling democratic work of building more robust, egalitarian institutions.\n\nThe new UN Week lived at “this intersection of doing well and doing well by doing good.” Darren Walker credited Clinton, whose event Ford was sponsoring, with the change. “It really was through the vehicle of CGI that so many new actors were mobilized and so many different modalities like impact investing—all of these other things started.” Clinton had used his extraordinary powers of convening to bring improbable partners together, and creative solutions to poverty and suffering had been born. However, Walker said, it was also the case that “philanthropists and commercial enterprises saw in CGI a platform that they could leverage for both doing good and building their brands.” As a result, self-service flirted dangerously with altruism at CGI, in Walker’s view. Why were all these CEOs flying in? “They fly here because they see investment opportunities; they see branding opportunities,” Walker said.\n\nIndeed, as CGI developed, it brought together a growing number of people inter­ested in “commandeering the role of government”: investors, entre­preneurs, social innovators, activists, entertainers, philanthropists, nonprofit executives, protocol-equipped consultants, and others, who came to brainstorm new double-bottom-line funds, plot against malaria, and also, since they were in town and so was everyone else, cut their own deals. And with every passing year, their growing pres­ence seemed to shift the center of gravity of UN Week. Two words came to define CGI: partnerships and commitments. Clinton invited people from various sectors—entrepreneurs, philanthropists, political leaders, labor unions, civil society—to work together on initiatives for societal betterment, and to make public promises about what they planned to achieve.

Giridharadas is that rare person who can challenge everything you believe in, and you will love him for it. He made me rethink if businesses truly can be forces for good, and under which conditions they can (and cannot). He made me appreciate the role of government in addressing complex social issues. I now actually think a career in public service/government could be a worthy career switch at some point.  · It’s filled to the brim with great quotes and real world examples of ethical dillemas. I wanted to write up some of the lessons learned from the book and encourage anyone to read it in full. If you’ve not heard of Anand Giridharadas, it’s worth diving into his work online. Giridharadas is an American journalist focussed on democracy, and the various threats to it.\n\nGiridharadas argues that the wealthy and powerful, often through philanthropy and corporate social responsibility initiatives, seek to address social issues without fundamentally challenging the structures that perpetuate those very issues.  · Many of us have bought into the theory that market world has a unique ability to address social woes effectively, which Giridharadas points out is like thinking “arsonists make the best firefighters”.  · He argues that this allows elites to maintain their privilege and influence while appearing altruistic and socially conscious.  · This might sound like your normal anti-capitalist schtick, but Giridharadas illustrates it through frank conversations with people who represent different sides of this story. He speaks to talented, purpose-driven young people who end up at consultancy firms like McKinsey, Bain and Boston Consultancy group, because they bought into the belief that the market is the place for world-changing, and market types are the ide\n\nHe also speaks to bankers, social entrepreneurs, the head of a large philanthropic organisation, and, representing government, even Bill Clinton himself.  · The depth of those conversations, and the willingness of people to open up about their doubts, astonished me. It wasn’t until the end of the book, when Giridharadas explains that he got access to these people through participation in a fellowship at the Aspen Institute, that I understood that these interviews where made possible by a deeper previous relationship.  · As a brand builder who has bought into the idea that the market can act as a force for good, this book challenged many of my beliefs, and I enjoyed it. There are many lessons in the book, but for me, these four stood out. 1. Market world solutions to complex problems often address the symptom, not the cause. We’ve created an environment of toxic positivity where we demand of ourselves and others to focus on solutions, not problems.\n\nGiridharadas points out the difference between public intellectuals and thought leaders. The public intellectuals are safe to offer critique because it does not bite the hand that feeds, but they are poorly funded. Thought leaders work through the market to productize their ideas.  · That describes me in some sense. In a very subtle way, I do self-censor. I think about what people think - and I adjust.  · He shares an example of a thought leader who advocates for safer workspaces for women. Over the years she learnt that if you want to talk about the structural power of sexism, first make people think of their daughters. Older men would then be moved to understand because they want their daughters to have every opportunity. Though effective, she felt this also shrank the problem somehow. After all - the men did not feel that their coworker deserved every opportunity.",

Of the good kind though. He spends about 300 or so pages in his new book dismantling the whole concept of how we perceive “doing good” and “social impact”. He systematically calls out a laundry list of people, organizations and concepts that have attempted positive change. This list includes social enterprises, impact investing, foundations run by rich capitalistic, oil-producing, hedge-fund managing “philanthropists”, “thought leaders” such as Adam Grant, Simon Sinek and Thomas Friedman, the Gates foundation, the Rockerfellers, B Corps, the Koch brothers (no surprise here), almost everything about the Clintons, the Aspen Institute, Uber, Summit at Sea — basically all of Silicon Valley — and most importantly, himself. The fact that he includes himself in the list is why we should all be listening and evaluating and changing.\n\nAnand’s premise, in a nutshell, is that the Utopian idea of “win-win” in the social impact space is just that, Utopia. He believes that despite all the above-mentioned elites spending the best part of the last 30–40 years trying to “do good” while also making money, there still exists an incredible amount of inequality of income. In fact, the data says that since 1980, in the United States, despite all the “great” work of philanthropists, foundations, social enterprises and impact investors, the richest 10% of the population has doubled their average pre-tax income and the richest 1% has more than tripled it. He argues, boldly and fairly, that social good in today’s world is a form of moral licensing — “I have donated a couple of mil to charity, so that makes it okay for me to continue drilling oil wells.” He argues that these elites, talk about doing more good instead of doing less bad, and live in somewhat of an echo-chamber, justifying their daily cake by giving a few crumbs to the \n\nSo Anand, here is my take. I am not going to argue against your argument on foundations, philanthropists and thought leaders — I agree where you are coming from and frankly don’t know enough to warrant a strong opinion. The only portion I want to argue for is social enterprise. The devil is always in the details and when it comes to SocEnts, that detail is the definition. For me, a social enterprise exists solely to solve a real problem and uses a financially sustainable business model to solve and scale it. It is profit-seeking to reduce dependencies on donations, grants and other one-time indirect revenue, but it is not profit-maximizing. A true social enterprise is tested when it needs to decide between maintaining its impact and increasing its margin, and in this “or” case, it will always stay true to impact. At this point a whole bunch of arguments are probably exploding in your head — what is a “real problem”? What do you mean by “impact”? Definitions are theoretical so can this \n\nTo tie all this together, yes seismic changes need to be made in the public sphere, even if that means more taxation, and negatively impacting the richest of the rich. But those systemic changes need to be corroborated by an impact-centric private sector which allows solutions to scale — we need to find that fine balance between the public and the private sector, and switch to doughnut economics when it comes to measuring economic progress. Income inequality will not and should not go away, but poverty can and will. What’s important is to ensure we live in this imagined society of ours giving everyone equality of opportunity. But equality of opportunity does not equal equality of outcome. Thank you, Anand, for finding the courage to write this book. It took me on an emotional and intellectual journey full of twists and turns. I want to be a social entrepreneur, so this seriously challenged my way of thinking.",

The book’s fundamental argument is that these practices are often self-serving and that instead of helping the less fortunate, they uphold and even increase the wealth, power, and status of elites. Giridharadas, a journalist, reveals the range of individuals connected to the elite world, whose stories provide various vantage points to critique the “charade” of elite-driven change. Other work by this author includes the book, The True American. This guide uses the 2018 Alfred A. Knopf edition of Winners Take All. ... In the Prologue, Giridharadas summarizes the book’s main argument: that elite-led efforts to promote social change are used to uphold the status quo and to increase elites’ gains.\n\nIn Chapter 1, “But How Is the World Changed?,” Giridharadas begins his primary method of argument, which involves using the stories of individuals connected to the elite world to critique that world. He tells the story of Hilary Cohen, an idealistic college student who is interested in doing work that inspires genuine social change. As a young graduate, Cohen is initially swayed by the rhetoric of corporations like Goldman Sachs and the consulting group McKinsey, who promise to be committed to solutions that are both business-friendly and the most effective way of enacting change. After working as a consultant for McKinsey, Cohen becomes more skeptical of such promises. However, she continues to work in the elite world, ultimately accepting a position with the Obama Foundation. Chapter 2, “Win-Win,” examines a fundamental aspect of business-world thinking, particularly as it applies to elite efforts to enact social change.\n\nGiridharadas argues that elites are beholden to “win-win” thinking, which insists that the only good solutions to social problems are those that lead to profits or other gains in addition to tangible good for individuals. Solutions that offer direct aid to individuals without the expectation of profits are characterized as “win-lose.” Thus, the only solutions elites will consider are those that lead to gains. For instance, entrepreneur Stacy Asher started an initiative called Portfolios with a Purpose, in which elites played a fantasy-football-style stock-picking game, and the proceeds went to people in need—while also bumping up the value of stocks to which the elites had connections. In Chapter 3, “Rebel-Kings in Worrisome Berets,” Giridharadas examines how elite leaders can cast themselves simultaneously as experts on solving social issues and as mavericks going against the grain of tradition.\n\nChapter 4, “The Critic and the Thought Leader,” examines the related topic of thought leadership. Elites promote thought leaders like Harvard Business School sociologist Amy Cuddy as experts whose ideas can fundamentally shape social change. However, Giridharadas notes, their ideas are often not open for free debate and in many cases are biased by elites’ expectations and preferences. Chapter 5, “Arsonists Make the Best Firefighters,” shares the stories of individuals with unique backgrounds who became involved in the world of elite-led social change. One is billionaire George Soros, who grew up in fascist-led Hungary and throughout his business career has been devoted to fighting injustice and oppression. Nevertheless, he began an Economic Advancement Program after being convinced that a market-led approach to fostering social change had merit.",

The thing is that they’re mostly waiting, and waiting longer than anyone thought.

Stanford Social Innovation Review. https://doi.org/10.48558/AXFQ-1S41 Copy Text ...\n\nMicrocredit, the iconic impact investment of the last decade, required more than $100 million in subsidies before it became a profitable business—and the impact has been disappointing at best. When overcoming market failure to reach the poor, it takes subsidy to do the R&D, launch the business, build the market, and sometimes even to deliver the product or service over time. Delivering at a price point the poor can afford almost always translates into very small margins. A good example is D-Rev, a small organization designing products that improve the health and incomes of poor people. They use donor subsidies to design products to the point where they are ready for manufacture and distribution at scale by for-profit companies (and sometimes not-for-profits). Because D-Rev can receive royalties via licensing agreements, funders they approach for grants often want them to take loans.\n\nFor all the hoopla, the definition of impact investing is still a dog’s breakfast. Inclusive definitions throw in everything from small donations (huh?) to investments that provide a market rate of return or above (which sounds a lot like plain vanilla investing). Here’s our—the Mulago Foundation’s—working definition: impact investing is the practice of putting money—loans or equity—into impact-focused organizations, while expecting less than a market rate of return. Investments that provide a big return don’t count: the market will take care of those, and we don’t need conferences to get people to put money into them. On its face, impact investing seems like a great deal—organizations get cheap money (er, “patient capital”) and investors get real impact. It’s great when it works that way, but the case for impact is often dubious, and there is a lot of confusion about when impact investing works and when it doesn’t.\n\nWhat worries us in that not-for-profit organizations in our portfolio are under increasing pressure to take loans, and some have even lost donors to the impact investing camp. Both philanthropy and impact investing are valid ways of doing good, but applied in the wrong way, either can do harm. For us, the right funding structure is the one that provides maximum impact for the target population. Mulago works to meet the basic needs of people in some of the poorest countries on Earth, and we’ve ended up with a portfolio that is 95 percent philanthropy.

For example, Kiva partner Together Association for Development and Environment partnered with researchers from the World Bank and found that their program increased participants’ monthly income by 66%. Similarly, Kiva introduced our partner, Fundación Santo Domingo, to Innovations for Poverty Action researchers, to enable research into the effect of flexible repayments on borrowers. These measures can provide MFIs and other social enterprises and development organizations with solutions to some of the core challenges that are limiting their impact measurement efforts.\n\nAs impact investors seek investable opportunities worldwide, their focus includes enterprises and other organizations that both improve their customers’ livelihoods and are financially sustainable. To direct their capital effectively and track its impact, these investors typically rely on output measurements, such as total capital invested by theme, or number of people served. This focus on outputs can help inform their investment decisions and reveal the impact of their funding to some degree, but more must be done to ensure that their investee organizations are truly creating positive change for customers. And unfortunately, social enterprises and other organizations often struggle to measure this outcome-focused impact in a sustainable way. Kiva has worked with more than 560 microfinance institutions (MFIs) and social enterprises globally since 2005 – many of which are the types of organizations that impact investors typically aim to support.\n\nTo better understand the results of these partnerships, we conduct an impact measurement survey annually – both for our current 130+ partners and for potential partners that apply for funding through Kiva.org. This article shares what we learned this year from this unique dataset, highlighting current impact measurement practices in the financial inclusion sector, gaps in these practices, and what the impact investing community can do to better design its measurement practices, products and services. In the past year, we received over 200 unique survey responses from partner MFIs, social enterprises and new applicants located in more than 65 countries. The results provide fascinating insights into the impact measurement practices of these social impact-focused organizations. The majority of these organizations (over 70%) are conducting impact studies, which is a promising sign of the growing awareness of the importance of measuring impact.\n\nWe believe these findings, along with the other insights we’ve learned from our surveys of Kiva partners, meaningfully contribute to the discussions of how impact investors and others can support more effective measurement practices and increase accountability for improving the livelihoods of investee organizations’ customers.

First, we explore how interaction between social enterprises (SEs) and impact investing (II) emerged as a new hybrid model and provide examples of this. Existing funding models for SEs are reviewed to ascertain the uniqueness of impact investor funds and the criteria that guide their decisions on investment in SEs. By so doing, we clarify differences between hybrid SEs that are for-profit and those that are not-for-profit. The different goals of SEs and IIs are also examined to determine how these organisations collaborate to create social impact in a society, drawing upon practitioner and academic research. The second part reviews relevant theories on inter-organisational collaboration between hybrid organisations. It focuses on the theoretical frame that guides the establishment of partner fit, using the concept of organisational compatibility from institutional logics and resources complementar\n\nAgrawal, A., & Hockerts, K.

To address this research objective a sample of impact investors are surveyed in South Africa, where there is an increasing demand for impact investors to fund initiatives that address the country’s many underlying structural deficits and wicked problems. Findings, based on correlational and regression analyses, indicate that variation in the impact investment decision is explained by the financial return motive. This finding resonates with the argument that investors are primarily focused on financial competitiveness and return on their investment. Developing a strong body of evidence that validates the effectiveness of policy in supporting impact investing is pivotal, particularly when given the lack of sustainability of many social en\n\nIn the African context, studies indicate that there are not enough investment-ready opportunities to meet the requirements of impact investors (UNDP, 2015). According to GIIN (2016) report, small and/or relatively new social enterprises vying for impact capital fail to meet the requirements of the impact investment funds as they fail to demonstrate a healthy financial track record, realistic projections, and strategies to scale (Findlay & Moran, 2019). Recognizing such hindrances, and knowledge of the impact of investor motives or objectives is essential to determine how investors prioritize the social impact versus the financial return expectation when investing funds in social enterprises (Jonsson & Lindbergh, 2013). Moreover, in delineating the motives for impact investing, it is important to recognize that investment decisions should not be misinterpreted to mean that impact investors simply make a trade-off between social and financial return.\n\nResearch is starting to emerge on impact investing in “developing economies in regions such as Latin America, Africa, Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe” (Urban & George, 2018, p. 65). However, studies examining social enterprises in Africa report that they face difficulties in terms of measures of impact investments and suffer from a lack of publically-available data (SIIT, 2014). At the same time, the impact investing landscape in Africa is witnessing significant attention and growth, with US$353,9 billion dedicated to impact investment ventures in nine countries on the continent (Dhlamini et al., 2016; GIIN, 2016). While South Africa is the major player in the sub-Saharan African impact investment market, the socio-economic context reveals that there is an increasing demand for impact investors to fund initiatives that address this country’s underlying structural problems (Urban, 2020; Urban & George, 2018).\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa not only are there extremely high rates of wicked problems which plague society, but governments and NGOs are unable to address these deficits, which means that the survival of many social enterprises remains precarious (Rivera-Santos et al., 2015). Not only does South Africa face enormous socio-economic challenges but the COVID-19 pandemic has depressed an already-ailing South African economy (The World Bank, 2019). Consequently, impact investments can steer a clear path in the recuperation of emerging economies such as South Africa (Urban, 2020), where there is an urgent need for adopting evidence-based policies and practices based on a clear understanding of impact investing motives. The article is organized as follows. First, the literature review section examines impact investing from a behavioral portfolio theory perspective, upon which hypotheses are formulated to be evaluated in the empirical part of the article.",

Impact returns add unique dimensions of value to investments and are compatible with a range of financial returns from below market to above market rate, depending on investors’ strategic goals. Impact investments can be made in markets at any stage of growth. The impact investment market provides capital to address the world’s most pressing challenges in sectors including energy, microfinance, healthcare, sustainable agriculture, infrastructure and housing.  · The practice of impact investing is defined by the following elements: Impact investing is marked by an intentional desire to contribute to measurable social and environmental benefits. Impact investing needs to use evidence and data where available to drive intelligent investment design.\n\nIn general, best practices for impact investing include: Developing a theory of change to identify the path to reach social and environmental impact objectives · Collaborating with relevant stakeholders to develop the theory of change and impact objectives · Setting performance targets related to these objectives using standardized metrics  · Monitoring and managing the performance of investees against these targets · Reporting on social and environmental performance to relevant stakeholders · Optimizing future impact returns based on data and learnings from past investments · Learn more about the Core Characteristics of Impact Investing · Impact investing challenges the long-held views that social and environmental issues should only be addressed by governments and philanthropists, and that market investors should focus exclusively on achieving financial returns.",

Gregory [13] cites multiple risks within the impact investing sector ...\n\nImpact investing pursues the dual goals of creating socio-economic value for the marginalized, and ensuring net positive financial returns. Impact investing firms achieve their goals through their investments in projects and enterprises which create both social and commercial values. The primary aim of this article is to contribute to our understanding of the process of impact investing, particularly with respect to issues related to aligning impact investing and investee social enterprise goals. The research method employs case-based research methodology. The data consist of six cases of impact investing and their investee social enterprises. In addition, the data involve interviews with experts from the field of impact investing. The findings are that: (1) Social mission plays an important moderating role in the inter-organizational relationship between the impact investor and the investee social enterprise, (2) and an emphasis on due diligence, sector specialization, and communicati\n\nThe findings suggest that impact investors would manage the tensions arising from competing logics better if they specialize in a particular sector and invest in social enterprises solving the social problems of that sector. Our findings suggest that when an impact investor has developed expertise in a particular social sector, its alignment with the investees is improved, and its performance (both social and commercial) is consequently higher. An increased focus on the social mission during the due diligence stage increases the probability of balancing competing logics at the inter-organizational level. Proposition 2b. Sector specialization of the impact investors increases the likelihood of inter-organizational alignment. Effective communication is an important criterion that unites two organizations with shared interests. The dominant literature on competing institution logics states that primary actors should communicate with one another to sustain an organizational process among c\n\nThe relationship between the impact investor and the investee social enterprises forms the major instrument that drives the legitimacy of the impact investing field by creating social and commercial value. Therefore, it is important to understand the inter-organizational relationship between impact investing and investee social enterprise. Such a study would help in understanding the dynamics involved in impact investing at the firm (or practice level); institutional pressures it experiences and help us understand how impact investment is different from traditional commercial investments like venture capital. Castellas, Ormiston, and Findlay [12] state that impact investing and the social entrepreneurship ecosystem are struggling to become mainstream due to the lack of standardization and replication of social impact measures. Gregory [13] cites multiple risks within the impact investing sector which would potentially reduce the financial returns.\n\nSimilarly, impact-investors’ greater communication on social returns while in practice emphasizing on financial returns increases the risks on external legitimacy. Roundy et al. [14] cite that social entrepreneurs fear the risk of mission drift when seeking funds from impact investors. Given that the field of impact investing is nascent and lacks a sufficient knowledge base, and given that impact investing draws its legitimacy from its ability to create social and financial value through its investments, it is important to understand the process of impact investing and the dynamics involved between impact investors and investee social enterprises at the inter-organizational level and how they manage their relationship. This article further explores the factors that enable inter-organizational alignment between impact investors and investee social enterprises.",

Fair trade organizations frequently work with agriculture and commodity producer-owned ...\n\nThe cooperative model of social enterprise provides direct benefit to its target population or \"clients,\" cooperative members, through member services: market information, technical assistance/extension services, collective bargaining power, economies of bulk purchase, access to products and services, access to external markets for member-produced products and services, etc. The cooperative membership is often comprised of small-scale producers in the same product group or a community with common needs--i.e. access to capital or healthcare. Cooperative members are the primary stakeholders in the cooperative, reaping benefits of income, employment, or services, as well as investing in the cooperative with their own resources of time, money, products, labor, etc. The cooperative model is embedded: the social program is the business. The cooperative's mission centers on providing members services.\n\nCooperatives social enterprises include agricultural marketing cooperatives, which market and sell its members' products, while agricultural supply cooperatives, provide inputs into the agricultural process. Fair trade organizations frequently work with agriculture and commodity producer-owned cooperatives--i.e. coffee, cocoa, wine tea, as well as nonagricultural products--i.e. handicrafts. Self-Help Groups (SHGs) comprised of low income-women, and popular in South Asia, are frequently organized into cooperatives to support a variety of their members' interests related to commerce, health and education. Credit Unions are another example of a cooperative tied to economic development and financial service programs, popular across West Africa, Latin America, and Balkans. In the UK a slight variation on the cooperative, called \"mutuals\" or \"societies\" are commonly associated with social enterprise.\n\nUnlike a true cooperative, mutual members usually do not contribute to the capital of the social enterprise company by direct investment, instead mutuals are frequently funded by philanthropic sources or the government. Theoretical example: cooperatively owned and run community savings and credit systems, \"Rotating Savings and Credit Associations\" (Latin America), Tontins (West Africa), Zadrugas (Balkans) are a form of indigenous credit union long implemented around the world to provide access to financial services. Self-organized community savings and credit systems are capitalized through member investments and savings, which are then mobilized as interest bearing loans also to members. Ownership is communal and equitable with all members owning a stake in the organization. Community savings and credit systems are democratically governed by an elected board of members responsible for financial oversight and loan approval and administration.\n\nEqual Exchange (EE) is a US-based fair trade coffee company legally structured as an employee-owned cooperative and an example of embedded social enterprise. Equal Exchange purchases coffee beans and cocoa directly from small democratically-run farmer cooperatives in developing countries at fair trade prices--a guaranteed minimum price regardless of how low commodities markets fall. Equal Exchange pays a fixed rate of $1.26 and $1.41 per pound for organic certified coffee in contrast to $0.45 and $0.60 per pound that buyers pay on the commodities market1 . The embedded nature of Equal Exchange's social programs is evidenced in its business activities.

The ultimate goal is to achieve sustainability by enabling non-profits to support themselves financially in innovative ways instead of relying solely on grants and donations. Since there are no shareholders in a non-profit organization, the profits from the related social enterprise are completely re-invested in the work of the organization. The emergence of revenue-generating activities for non-profits has created a new operating model where business principles, market characteristics and values (competition, diversification, entrepreneurship, innovation, and a focus on the bottom line) co-exist and work with traditional public sector values like responsiveness to community and serving the public interest. Essential to the success of a social enterprise is an effective business model.\n\nThe business model for a social enterprise is the channel that the social entrepreneur converts inputs into outcomes; the generation of both social value (measurable impact) and economic value (revenue).

Examples are legislations in Brazil and Spain; the former regulates social cooperatives (cooperativas sociais) through Law no.\n\nDespite the many similarities, cooperatives cannot be considered directly as social enterprises because they do not meet all the requirements to be so. However, within this type of entity, a type of cooperative has emerged—the social cooperative. It adapts some of the attributes of the social enterprise while respecting cooperative principles, and is considered by many to be a type of social enterprise. This type of cooperative is increasing its presence by leaps and bounds worldwide, especially in Europe, where more than ten states have already adjusted their legislation to introduce them. However, the regulation of this type of cooperative has been carried out unevenly, using different names to refer to them and without a clear consensus on how they should be configured. This study analyzed the different legislations of the main countries that regulate this type of cooperative to establish some common characteristics that may allow the identification of the distinctive features of th\n\nAmong those that are obliged to allocate them to general interest purposes are the Italian social cooperative, which has to allocate these assets to public utility purposes; and Belgian cooperative as a social enterprise, which has to allocate them to purposes related to its corporate purpose that is of general interest. Among those that allocate the remaining assets to the cooperative movement are the Portuguese social cooperative, which must allocate them to another cooperative of general interest, preferably in the same municipality (Article 8); and Spanish, Basque, and Catalan cooperatives, to which the general regime applies. The South Korean social cooperative is in an intermediate situation, between general interest and support for the cooperative movement; it can allocate surpluses to the social cooperative federation, a social cooperative with similar purposes, a non-profit entity, a public service entity, or to the National Treasury (Article 104).\n\nIn Europe, most social enterprises have their origins in the tradition of the cooperative movement in the fields of labor, agriculture, health, retail, credit, and education.Footnote 1 The first works that studied social enterprises in Europe were developed in Italy in 1990. These works elaborated a conception of the social enterprise with many similarities to the traditional model of cooperatives, adapted to provide answers to more social needs.Footnote 2 In 1991, the Italian Parliament passed a specific law for social cooperatives, which led to an extraordinary boom of these entities throughout Europe.Footnote 3 After this pioneering experience, European legislators found the cooperative model to be the most appropriate, or the most natural, for framing the phenomenon of social enterprises,Footnote 4 to the point of being considered by some as a modified form of the cooperative.Footnote 5 ·\n\nLegislators have opted for different formulas, which may seem contrary to the logic that a social cooperative regulated through its own law would be regulated in greater detail than a social cooperative regulated within a general law on cooperatives. As such, social cooperatives do not demonstrate a clear correlation between the form of regulation and their greater or lesser degree of development. Depending on this degree of development, three models of regulationFootnote 14 can be found (Table 1): Legislation with little regulation: These are laws that only contain the definition of a social cooperative and a list of the activities to which it may be dedicated. In some cases, these laws also generalize the characteristics of the people to whom they are addressed and the presence of volunteers. Examples are legislations in Brazil and Spain; the former regulates social cooperatives (cooperativas sociais) through Law no.",

These SEs focus on building relationships and otherwise connecting their clients with markets for their clients’ products and services.\n\nA business model is a structure, design or framework that a business follows to bring value to its customers and clients. However, there are at least three measures of the success of a business model—its ability to generate profit for its owners, its ability to generate positive change in the world, and its ability to achieve a balance of profit and positive change. The first approach applies to traditional for-profit companies; the second approach applies to traditional charities; and the third approach (a balance between profit and positive change) applies to social enterprises. Given the definition above, a social business model is a structure, design or framework that a social business follows in order to bring about a positive change while maintaining healthy financial returns. Yet despite sharing this basic framework, social entrepreneurs have a wide spectrum of viable social business models to choose from.\n\nTo help shed light on that spectrum, in 2012 Wolfgang Grassi (aka W. Grassi) identified nine types of social business models. He began his analysis with three factors guiding any social business: the mission, the type of integration, and the target population. He then explored the way in which these three factors intersected with the three traditional categories of business (for-profit, not-for-profit and hybrids) to generate the nine specific types of social business models that any social enterprise could adopt. ... This model of social enterprise (SE) sells business support services directly to the entrepreneurs in its target population. In other words, this type of SE helps entrepreneurs get their businesses off the ground. Support can come in the form of consulting services, training, microfinancing or technical support. Organizations that belong to this category may include economic development organizations, business development service organizations and microfinancers.\n\nAlthough most social enterprises may fall naturally into one of W. Grassi’s nine categories above, there is always room for new and combined models to emerge.",

Example: The partnership between Unilever and the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) is an illustrative example of the private-nonprofit partnership model.\n\n6. Cooperative Model: The cooperative model involves organising a business as a cooperative, where members collectively own and operate the enterprise. The primary goal of cooperatives is to serve the interests and needs of their members while also benefiting the broader community. Example: The Mondragon Corporation, based in the Basque region of Spain, is a well-known example of a company operating the cooperative model. It is a federation of worker cooperatives spanning various sectors, including industry, finance, education, and retail. Mondragon fosters democratic decision-making, profit-sharing, and social responsibility among its members, creating a sustainable and inclusive business ecosystem. 7. Market Linkage Model: The market linkage model directly connects marginalised producers or suppliers to markets, cutting out unnecessary intermediaries.\n\nImpact investing has gained popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of investors looking for ways to align their investments with their values. It involves investors seeking out social enterprises and investing in them for both financial returns and social impact. Impact investing aims to create a sustainable business model that generates both financial sustainability and social returns. This type of investment not only provides social entrepreneurs with the necessary capital to start or scale their businesses but also ensures that the investors' money is being used to create a positive social impact. In conclusion, social entrepreneurship is not just about creating a positive social impact, but it's also about a viable business model that is scalable. Striking the right balance between societal impact and financial growth is crucial to the success of social entrepreneurs, and this can be achieved through innovative business models.\n\nSocial entrepreneurship is often associated with a \"do good\" mentality. However, the reality of running a successful social enterprise involves balancing both financial sustainability and social impact. In this article, we dive deep into various innovative business models social entrepreneurs utilise and highlight real-life examples of successful ventures that have balanced impact and profit.  · Understanding the balance between impact and profit Social entrepreneurship is the pursuit of business ventures that prioritise social or environmental impact alongside financial success. The objective is to create sustainable change and encourage ethical values while generating revenue in the process. But, balancing impact and profit can be challenging. While it may be tempting to prioritise impact over profit, it's crucial to realise that social change cannot happen without a sustainable business model.\n\nExample: One well-known company operating the social franchise model is VisionSpring. VisionSpring is a global social enterprise that addresses vision impairment by training local individuals as \"vision entrepreneurs\" in underserved communities. These entrepreneurs sell affordable eyeglasses, conduct vision screenings, and provide primary eye care services, leveraging VisionSpring's brand and support. 13. Private-Nonprofit Partnership Model: The private-nonprofit partnership model involves collaboration between a for-profit business and a nonprofit organisation to jointly pursue social or environmental objectives. The partners combine their expertise, resources, and networks to create a sustainable and impactful venture. Example: The partnership between Unilever and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is an illustrative example of the private-nonprofit partnership model.",

For example, Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) give employees an ownership stake in the company. Trusts are another strategy; they can hold some or all of a company’s stock on behalf of certain beneficiaries, such as its workers, or in service of a social purpose. Many emerging business models draw on the co-op idea; while they aren’t formal co-ops per se, they can still gain some of the benefits. In my recent work on the idea of an “Exit to Community” for startups, we’ve been exploring a wide range of models for shared ownership. Globally, commonwealths are a major market force. The largest cooperatives generate about $2.2 trillion in turnover and employ about 10 percent of the world’s employed population. For example: In Canada, the vast credit-union federation Desjardins is a cooperative bank.\n\nCooperatives are a different way of doing business. They have been around since the 19th century, but many people aren’t familiar with them. They’re likely all around you, blending in with for-profit enterprises but serving a very different purpose. In this article, I’ll describe what makes a cooperative and how you can build the principles into your enterprise. I’ll describe advantages and disadvantages and how cooperatives are being retooled for the modern era. These ideas are adapted from my 2018 book, Everything for Everyone: The Radical Tradition that Is Shaping the Next Economy. Cooperatives are based on the idea that those who use an enterprise — the members — should also own and govern it. Cooperative members decide to produce, how to do it, and what to do with the profits. The goal is to make businesses truly accountable to those they claim to serve.\n\nCooperatives have greater trust and loyalty from customers. Customers see cooperatives as providing higher quality products and more worker and community benefits. Cooperatives are more resilient. They have a lower chance of failure, especially after the startup phase, and greater resilience in downturns (likely due to shared sacrifice and greater risk aversion). Today, as digital firms dominate the economy, the democracy of cooperatives has even more appeal. It can provide safeguards around data privacy and labour conditions, both under threat. Cooperatives have disadvantages as well. Raising capital is a challenge in an economy designed for investor ownership. Lenders and investors expect businesses to be owned by a small group of founders, not a community of members; we need policies that can change that. Cooperatives can become stuck in their ways.",

Service subsidization is one of the most common SE models, as almost any SE can adopt it. In contrast to organizational support SEs (see below), service subsidization SEs integrate their internal business with external social programs. For example, a law firm may use the revenue generated from the firm’s regular law practice to fund a social program that provides free law services to those in need. The firm may run the program out of their own offices and may provide the free law services themselves. If you want an easy, scaled-down book to read, why not try Business Models for Dummies?

Christal Earle, Brave Soles: How Woman’s Mission to Save her Daughter Led to Upcycling and Ingenuity Breaking the Poverty Cycle ·\n\nA business model is a structure, design or framework that a business follows to bring value to its customers and clients. However, there are at least three measures of the success of a business model—its ability to generate profit for its owners, its ability to generate positive change in the world, and its ability to achieve a balance of profit and positive change. The first approach applies to traditional for-profit companies; the second approach applies to traditional charities; and the third approach (a balance between profit and positive change) applies to social enterprises. Given the definition above, a social business model is a structure, design or framework that a social business follows in order to bring about a positive change while maintaining healthy financial returns. Yet despite sharing this basic framework, social entrepreneurs have a wide spectrum of viable social business models to choose from.\n\nTo help shed light on that spectrum, in 2012 Wolfgang Grassi (aka W. Grassi) identified nine types of social business models. He began his analysis with three factors guiding any social business: the mission, the type of integration, and the target population. He then explored the way in which these three factors intersected with the three traditional categories of business (for-profit, not-for-profit and hybrids) to generate the nine specific types of social business models that any social enterprise could adopt. ... This model of social enterprise (SE) sells business support services directly to the entrepreneurs in its target population. In other words, this type of SE helps entrepreneurs get their businesses off the ground. Support can come in the form of consulting services, training, microfinancing or technical support. Organizations that belong to this category may include economic development organizations, business development service organizations and microfinancers.",

By co...\n\nThis article seeks to shed light on the diversity of scaling strategies of social enterprises, which can be considered as emblematic hybrid organizations. By comparing three Flemish renewable energy cooperatives with contrasted scaling strategies, the article shows how these strategies can be understood in relation to the organizational mission as imprinted at the founding. We extend the notion of hybridity beyond the combination of institutional logics to highlight the interest orientation (mutual vs. general interest). Unlike what is suggested in extant literature, we find that mutual interest orientation may be associated with “scale-up,” business growth strategies, while general interest orientation may lead to less growth-focused “scale-out” and “scale-deep” strategies. The findings illuminate aspects of the hybrid nature of social enterprises by explaining their diverse scaling strategies and extend the notion of imprinting to the interorganizational level by highlighting how soc\n\nThe way in which members are designated varies with the legal form: “shareholders” in social enterprises incorporated as for-profit businesses, “cooperators” or “cooperative members” in cooperatives, and simply “members” in nonprofit organizations (Spear et al., 2009). While this approach in terms of interest orientation is particularly relevant in member-based hybrid organizations (Mitzinneck & Besharov, 2019), we suggest that it is useful for hybrid organizations in general. Indeed, it differs from and adds to the distinction between integrated and differentiated hybrid organizational models of social enterprises (Santos, Pache, & Birkholz, 2015), which rather relates to the operational dimension of the social enterprise (financial model and/or organization of production) instead of its governance—that is, the way in which the organization is directed, controlled, and held accountable (Mair, Mayer, & Lutz, 2015).\n\nTheir embeddedness in a specific community is therefore likely to be higher, making them more inclined to adopt depth-scaling strategies (Smith & Stevens, 2010), such as horizontal diversification, in order to provide their members with a broader range of services (Desa & Koch, 2014). This is particularly the case for community-based enterprises, which focus on the local context of needs and collective action of the community members. However, to our best knowledge, no research so far has examined how the social enterprises’ organizational mission at the time of the founding, including their mutual and/or general interest orientation, imprints their subsequent scaling strategies. The next section describes how three cases have been purposefully contrasted to explore this relationship. The renewable energy cooperative (also “REScoop”) model enables citizens, as cooperative members, to collectively own and manage renewable energy projects at the local level, often producing social benefi\n\nBattilana J., Sengul M., Pache A.-C., Model J.

            "text": "Alright, I've got the research. Let me break down what I found and help you build a coherent argument for why solidarity models matter and why the current impact investing system is broken for enterprises like yours.\n\n**The Winners Take All Problem:**\n\nGiridharadas's core argument is that business elites are taking over the work of changing the world, but they may be protecting the very system that's at the root of the problems they claim to solve. Here's the key insight that applies to your work: The \"Even\" app example - a VC-backed solution that charges people $260/year to smooth out their unpredictable income caused by corporate shift scheduling. Instead of fixing the labor practices that create income volatility, investors profit from helping poor people cope with it.\n\nThis is exactly what's happening to your teams. The system creates the problem (lack of funding infrastructure for social enterprises that serve the poor), then offers market-based \"solutions\" (impact investors demanding 10x returns) that don't actually solve anything for people like Mary Claire.\n\n**Why Scale-At-All-Costs Breaks Social Enterprises:**\n\nHere's your coherent argument: The pressure to scale forces social enterprises to optimize for investor returns rather than community impact. Think of it like this - when you're baking bread for your neighborhood, you know exactly who needs gluten-free, who likes it crusty, whose kid has a nut allergy. You're embedded in relationships. But if investors push you to become \"the Starbucks of bread,\" you have to standardize everything, cut costs, maximize efficiency, and suddenly you're just another extractive business that happens to use \"artisan\" in its marketing.\n\nResearch from Mulago Foundation found that very few solutions that meet fundamental needs of the poor will get you your money back - scalable rural livelihoods, basic health care, basic education, clean water, with very few exceptions you don't make money off this stuff.\n\nYour teams aren't failing. The funding model is failing them. Mary Claire's tampon dispensers in 8 schools in Cameroon IS scale - just not the kind that generates investor returns. She's solving a real problem in a culturally appropriate way that keeps girls in school. But because her margins are thin and her market is poor women, she's uninvestable by conventional standards.\n\n**The Accelerator Treadmill:**\n\nYou nailed this in your transcript. Small and relatively new social enterprises fail to meet impact investor requirements because they can't demonstrate healthy financial track records, realistic projections, and strategies to scale. So what do they do? They go from one accelerator to the next, not because they need more training, but because they need that next $5k-10k stipend to survive. It's like telling someone \"we'll teach you to fish\" but then never letting them fish, just sending them to more fishing seminars.\n\nThe whole model is schizophrenic - you're asking people in precarious situations to take risks, innovate, fail fast, but then abandoning them right when they start generating revenue because they're \"too successful\" for grants but not \"scalable enough\" for investment.\n\n**Why 1 Million Millionaires > 100 Billionaires:**\n\nHere's your argument: Wealth distribution is about power distribution. One hundred billionaires means 100 people making decisions that affect billions. One million people with modest wealth means a million decision-makers embedded in a million communities, each with local knowledge and accountability to the people around them.\n\nLook at the cooperative model - Mondragon Corporation in Spain is a federation of worker-owned cooperatives spanning industry, finance, education, and retail, fostering democratic decision-making and profit-sharing. They've created thousands of good jobs and built community wealth without needing to become a unicorn or exit to private equity.\n\nOr credit unions - they're not trying to be Bank of America. They're trying to serve their members. And globally, the largest cooperatives generate about $2.2 trillion in turnover and employ about 10 percent of the world's employed population.\n\nThe scale is there, it's just distributed differently. It's horizontal rather than vertical. It's a forest, not a skyscraper.\n\n**The Real Problems Your Teams Face:**\n\nBased on the research and your transcript, here are the specific systemic issues:\n\n1. **The Funding Cliff**: After accelerators, organizations face a support gap - too big for grants, too small or wrong model for investment capital. This is where Mary Claire is stuck.\n\n2. **Misaligned Metrics**: Impact investors' three most important screening criteria are authenticity of founding team, importance of societal problem, and financial sustainability, with equity investors placing higher value on large-scale implementation. Notice what's missing? Cultural appropriateness, community embeddedness, relational depth.\n\n3. **The Double Bind**: Organizations serving the poorest communities have to keep prices low, which means thin margins. Thin margins mean slow growth. Slow growth means uninvestable. So the people who most need entrepreneurial solutions are served by organizations that can't access capital.\n\n4. **Mission Drift Pressure**: Social entrepreneurs fear mission drift when seeking funds from impact investors. Your teams know that if they chase investor money, they'll have to change what they do and who they serve.\n\n5. **Geographic Bias**: The whole ecosystem is designed for deals that can be monitored from Silicon Valley or London. If you're working in Cameroon or Lebanon, good luck getting investors to visit, understand your context, or stick around through the messy middle.\n\n**Alternative Solutions Beyond Your Two:**\n\nYou mentioned two possibilities (Amazon marketplace for Bloom teams, and solidarity fund). Here are three more to consider:\n\n**Solution 3: Mutual Credit System**  \nInstead of pooling revenue, create a time-banking or mutual credit system where teams can trade services and support without money changing hands. The Lebanese team building AI for people with disabilities could provide tech consulting to Mary Claire's team, who could offer workshops on community engagement to another team, etc. You'd be the clearinghouse that tracks and facilitates these exchanges. This builds interdependence without requiring teams to share revenues they need to survive.\n\n**Solution 4: Collective Bargaining for Services**  \nBloom negotiates bulk rates for services all your teams need - accounting, legal, web hosting, marketing, insurance. You become like Namaste Solar's purchasing cooperative: They created Amicus Solar, a purchasing co-op that allows small solar utilities across North America to buy equipment together, dramatically lowering costs. The 18-month grant funds you to negotiate these deals and manage the shared services platform.\n\n**Solution 5: Community Investment Fund with Graduated Returns**  \nInstead of traditional investors demanding market rates, create a fund where \"investors\" are actually community members, Bloom alumni, and solidarity-minded individuals who accept returns tied to community outcomes rather than financial multiples. Teams pay back based on what they can afford, when they can afford it. You're essentially creating a sharia-compliant or gift economy investment vehicle. The EG money helps you pilot this with your 10-11 teams, document what works, and create a model others can replicate.\n\n**Framing for Echoing Green:**\n\nHere's how you package this:\n\n**Problem**: The social impact ecosystem has created a valley of death for enterprises that succeed at community impact but don't fit investor-return models. Accelerators train entrepreneurs, then abandon them to an investment landscape that demands they either scale like tech startups or die. This is especially acute for entrepreneurs in the Global South serving the poorest communities, where thin margins and cultural embeddedness are features, not bugs.\n\n**Root Cause**: The impact investing field has imported Silicon Valley's \"scale or fail\" logic without questioning whether that model serves the communities we claim to help. We've created a system where investors hope to make millions by asking those on the edge of poverty to solve problems caused by the profit-maximizing choices of wealthy corporations.\n\n**Your Solution**: Build the missing infrastructure - persistent community support for Bloom's network of 10-11 social entrepreneurs across 16 countries. Full-time community activation that provides peer learning, shared services, visibility/storytelling, and pilots solidarity economy models like resource pooling or mutual credit. Transform Bloom from a program that abandons teams after 3 months to a community that supports them for the long haul.\n\n**Innovation**: Most support organizations treat social enterprises as individual units competing for scarce funding. You're building collective infrastructure based on solidarity economy principles - the idea that we're stronger together than apart, and that success doesn't require someone else to fail.\n\n**Systems Change**: This challenges the dominant \"winners take all\" model of social entrepreneurship support and creates an alternative based on mutual aid, distributed power, and community resilience. Instead of trying to create the next Ashoka Fellow or TED speaker, you're building a federation of enterprises that support each other, pool resources, and prove that horizontal scale (many small successes) can rival vertical scale (one big winner).\n\n**Outcomes for EG Application:**\n- X number of enterprises sustained/grown over 18 months\n- X dollar value of shared services negotiated\n- X cross-team collaborations facilitated  \n- Pilot solidarity fund with Y teams participating\n- Case studies/stories published to demonstrate alternative model\n- Blueprint for community-based support infrastructure that others can replicate\n\n**Why This Matters Now**: Post-COVID, post-Gaza war, as funding priorities shift and USAID money dries up, the embers of the Arab Spring - the entrepreneurs who stuck around - need new infrastructure. They've proven their commitment. Now they need community, not just capital.\n\nDoes this help? Want me to look at specific aspects more deeply or help you draft actual application language in your voice?",

Problems with standardized education (cultural mismatches, one-size-fits-all doesn't work, ignores context)\n5. SDG localization challenges (top-down doesn't work, needs local adaptation, 65% of SDG targets tied to local governments)\n\nNow I need to organize this into:\n1. A table format showing problems and opportunities\n2. A problems → opportunities framework\n\nLet me structure this comprehensively for the user.Okay, I've got a lot of research on problems with mega-systems versus local/small-scale solutions. Let me organize this in two ways for you: first in a table, then as a problems → opportunities framework.\n\n## TABLE FORMAT: Mega Systems vs. Local/Small Solutions\n\n| **Domain** | **Mega System Problems** | **Evidence** | **Local/Small Solution Benefits** | **Evidence** |\n|------------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Education (Online Platforms)** | Lack of teacher presence and human interaction; students perceive Khan Academy as independent learning but stress importance of teacher presence as mediating cognitive and emotional learning | Multiple studies | Community-embedded learning with cultural relevance | Cultural mismatches occur when learning environment differs from home culture, adversely affecting learning for minority students |\n| | 40% of Khan Academy exercises focus on calculating/solving vs. only 25% on actual assessments; 74% produce numbers or multiple-choice responses | Research analysis | Teachers who understand local context | By age 8, enthusiasm for learning can be significantly negatively affected by cultural mismatch between school and home |\n| | Majority of MOOCs focus on factual knowledge; student-content interaction most common, rare examples of deep interaction and feedback | Educational scalability study | Differentiated, culturally sustaining practices | One-size-fits-all fails to accommodate vast diversity of societal needs, overlooks context-specific education responsive to local realities |\n| **Development Interventions** | Larger studies show smaller effect sizes; government-implemented programs have smaller effects than NGO/academic programs | Meta-analysis of 600+ studies | Community-driven development with local ownership | Locally led programs with local implementation provide best evidence about effectiveness and sustainability |\n| | Kenyan teacher reform: NGO contracts raised test scores significantly, identical government contracts produced zero impact | Specific case study | Community as agent model: respecting and reinforcing natural adaptive, supportive, developmental capacities of communities | Community intervention research |\n| | Difficulty maintaining quality at scale | Even highly successful pilot programs difficult to scale cost-effectively; quality depends heavily on trainers | Small-scale urban interventions (urban acupuncture) | Small-scale interventions are cost-effective, quick to implement; address mental health in accessible way through community involvement |\n| **SDG Implementation** | SDG implementation in India follows top-down approach, but to achieve targets, bottom-up approach should be followed | India case study | Localized SDG adaptation | Only 5% of global SDG indicators could be used without modification at local level in Japan; 50% could be used after localization |\n| | Only 16% of SDG targets on track globally; 84% showing limited progress or reversal | 2024 SDG Report | Local government leadership | 65% of SDG targets directly tied to responsibilities of local/regional governments |\n| | Lack of harmony in tracking/monitoring systems; difficulties defining \"local\" as purely jurisdictional; lack of inclusion of edge communities | SDG localization baseline | Context-specific implementation | Need for implementations reflecting local realities, challenges, and capacities; cities as active drivers, not just implementation sites |\n| **Impact Investing** | Few solutions meeting fundamental needs of poor will get money back; scalable rural livelihoods, basic health, education, clean water - you don't make money off this | Mulago Foundation | Cooperative/solidarity models | Cooperatives generate $2.2 trillion globally, employ 10% of world's employed population; more resilient, lower failure rates |\n| | Small/new social enterprises fail to meet impact investor requirements: can't demonstrate healthy financial records, realistic projections, strategies to scale | South Africa research | Revenue-sharing / mutual aid structures | Renewable energy cooperatives show diverse scaling strategies; mutual interest can lead to \"scale-out\" and \"scale-deep\" rather than just \"scale-up\" |\n| **Standardization Effects** | American education has all downsides of standardization - rigid, suboptimal, one-size-fits-all - without benefits | Analysis of US education | Locally adaptive solutions | Communities proactively developing community ventures and scaling community movement through infrastructure shift, nurturing, sustaining |\n\n---\n\n## PROBLEMS → OPPORTUNITIES FRAMEWORK\n\n### Problem Space 1: **THE KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER GAP**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Students using Khan Academy perceive themselves as independent learners but stress that teacher presence mediates both cognitive and emotional learning\n- MOOCs provide primarily student-content interaction; rare examples of deep interaction and formative feedback\n- Mega platforms optimize for what computers can easily grade (numbers, multiple-choice) not what humans actually need to learn\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Community Learning Networks**: Create peer-to-peer learning systems where Bloom teams teach each other based on complementary expertise\n→ **Embedded Mentorship**: Your Lebanese AI team could mentor Mary Claire's Cameroon team on using technology, while she mentors them on community engagement\n→ **Contextual Knowledge Exchange**: Instead of standardized curricula, facilitate knowledge transfer that respects local context and builds on existing cultural practices\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 2: **THE SCALE PARADOX**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Meta-analysis of 600+ research papers found larger studies have smaller effect sizes; programs implemented by governments have smaller effects than academic/NGO programs\n- Quality deteriorates when moving from pilot to scale because context, relationships, and nuance get lost\n- The pressure to \"scale\" forces standardization which kills the very thing that made the solution work\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Horizontal Federation Instead of Vertical Scale**: Like Mondragon's federation of worker cooperatives spanning various sectors with democratic decision-making\n→ **Franchise the Process, Not the Solution**: Share the methodology (how to do community needs assessment, how to co-design with users) not the exact program\n→ **Scale Through Replication**: Help 50 communities build their own Mary Claire-style initiatives rather than forcing Mary Claire to become a multinational corporation\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 3: **THE CULTURAL MISMATCH CRISIS**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Cultural mismatch occurs when learning environment culture differs from home culture; by age 8, enthusiasm for learning and self-confidence can be significantly negatively affected\n- One-size-fits-all approach overlooks importance of context-specific education responsive to local environmental, cultural, socio-economic realities\n- Global solutions impose Western middle-class norms as \"appropriate behavior\"\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Culturally-Embedded Solutions**: Bloom teams ARE the solution to this - they're proximate, they understand cultural context, they design WITH not FOR communities\n→ **Localization as Innovation**: Help teams articulate how their \"non-scalable\" cultural specificity is actually their competitive advantage\n→ **Anti-Portfolio**: Create case studies showing why certain solutions SHOULD NOT be replicated elsewhere because context matters\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 4: **THE TOP-DOWN TRAP**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- SDG implementation follows top-down approach but to achieve targets, bottom-up approach needed\n- Only 5% of global SDG indicators could be used without modification at local level; 50% could be used after localization\n- Currently only 16% of SDG targets on track; 84% showing limited progress or reversal\n- Global frameworks ignore that 65% of SDG targets are tied to local/regional government responsibilities\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Bottom-Up SDG Implementation**: Position Bloom as SDG localization infrastructure - you're the bridge between global goals and local reality\n→ **Local Indicator Development**: Help teams develop their own success metrics that matter to their communities, not just donor-friendly KPIs\n→ **Proof of Concept for Localization**: Use your 10-11 teams to demonstrate that locally-led, context-specific approaches outperform standardized interventions\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 5: **THE FUNDING CLIFF**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Solutions meeting fundamental needs of poor won't get money back - rural livelihoods, basic health, education, clean water\n- Small social enterprises fail to meet impact investor requirements: can't demonstrate financial track records, projections, scale strategies\n- Accelerator → investor pipeline is broken for enterprises serving poor communities with thin margins\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Alternative Capital Structures**: Build what renewable energy cooperatives demonstrate - diverse scaling strategies including \"scale-out\" and \"scale-deep\" not just vertical growth\n→ **Prove Resilience Over Returns**: Cooperatives have lower failure rates, especially after startup phase, and greater resilience in downturns\n→ **Redefine Success**: Create measurement framework showing that 10 sustainable $100k/year businesses serving 1000 people each is more valuable than 1 venture-backed company serving 10,000 people extractively\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 6: **THE IMPLEMENTATION DESERT**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Kenyan education reform: NGO-offered contracts raised test scores, identical government contracts = zero impact\n- Local actors find it difficult to engage at national/regional/global levels where priority-setting, programming, funding are decided\n- Even successful pilots fail at scale because the \"how\" matters as much as the \"what\"\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Implementation Community of Practice**: Your 18-month EG fellowship creates peer learning network where teams troubleshoot implementation together\n→ **Document the Invisible Work**: Capture the relationships, trust-building, cultural negotiation that makes programs work - the stuff that doesn't show up in logic models\n→ **Implementation Toolkit**: Create resources not for replicating solutions but for adapting implementation strategies to new contexts\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 7: **THE AGENCY VACUUM**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Communities are defined as much by whom they exclude as whom they include; network of relationships may be under stress\n- Top-down interventions treat communities as beneficiaries, not agents\n- Localization is not merely top-down implementation but dynamic process aligning global goals with local governance structures, actors, tools\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Community as Agent**: Use the model that respects and reinforces natural adaptive, supportive, developmental capacities of communities\n→ **Shift Power**: Your solidarity fund literally shifts decision-making power - teams decide together how to allocate resources, not external investors\n→ **Build Civil Society**: Create lasting infrastructure for community self-organization that outlives any individual program or funding cycle\n\n---\n\n## KEY INSIGHTS FOR YOUR APPLICATION:\n\n**The Meta-Argument:**\nThe entire social impact sector has confused \"scale\" with \"impact.\" We've imported Silicon Valley's growth metrics into contexts where they don't apply. The result: we fund solutions that look good in PowerPoints but fail in practice, while defunding precisely the embedded, contextual, relational work that actually transforms communities.\n\n**Your Competitive Advantage:**\nBloom's \"weakness\" (that your teams won't scale like tech startups) is actually your strength. You're building the infrastructure the sector is missing - the persistent, community-embedded, culturally-specific support that outlasts any single funding cycle.\n\n**Frame It As:**\nNot \"small is beautiful\" nostalgia, but evidence-based pragmatism. The research shows local, contextual, community-led solutions outperform standardized interventions. You're not being anti-scale; you're being pro-effectiveness.\n\nWant me to help you craft specific application language using this framework?",

Use Common Sense Education&#x27;s reviews and learning ratings to find the best media and edtech resources for your classroom.\n\nKhan Academy, a free website aimed at promoting self-paced instruction, houses academic videos that are often baked into guided, adaptive instruction. With a focus on math, the site also offers video tutorials on a variety of topics in science, economics, the arts, and computing, as well as prep for tests like the SAT.\n\nBottom Line: A robust resource for targeted, individualized instruction in most standardized subject areas. ... Khan Academy is great to introduce, practice, and review content. Though math is the most comprehensively covered subject, teachers focusing on science, computing, history, or economics can teach or supplement full courses with Khan Academy. Math and reading content is organized by course and grade level, so it's easy to target students' instruction for a particular level and skill. Plus, you can set a course mastery goal, which will automatically give kids the practice to help them reach that objective. Use Math: Great Ready Courses to help get kids up to grade level. Class setup is simple, and Khan Academy integrates with Google Classroom, too. To make the most of Khan Academy's features, explore the Khan for Educators course located in the teacher dashboard.\n\nUsing the site's powerful analytical and adaptive program, you can track students' progress and identify students who may be struggling in certain areas. If students are using Khan Academy during class, take advantage of the real-time reporting. You can stop the class to teach a skill they are all missing, or target students who are struggling with some small-group instruction.  · The new AI tool Khanmigo (an add-on paid service at the time of publication), powered by ChatGPT, offers a variety of features to both teachers and students. Khanmigo can generate lesson plans, rubrics, assessments, learning objectives, exit tickets, and more. You can even create themed lessons based on students' interests.  · Students can chat with Khanmigo too; the AI won't do the students' work for them, but will give them hints and guide them in a way a teacher might.\n\nKhanmigo can answer questions and walk students through detailed steps to problem-solve. It also offers auto-prompts like \"Give me a summary,\" or \"Why should I care about learning this?\" It even sends encouraging messages to students, redirects them toward the exercises, and offers to talk about other topics to build a relationship with students who are discouraged.

A majority of students were attempting early algebra, and many students were experimenting with trigonometry and calculus. These students were excited, engaged, and loved being challenged. Inadvertently, we highlighted a distinct but not often discussed problem with standardized, age-focused education. Students performing at high levels are often not sufficiently challenged. Teachers shouldn’t take kids who already know the material, and make sure they already know the material. Teachers should be pushing and challenging the students to their full abilities. Los Altos didn’t think everything was perfect because their students were scoring well on standardized exams; they saw significant value in creating an environment that was engaging and challenging for all students.\n\n\"A lot of my own educational experience was spent frustrated with how information was conveyed in textbooks and lectures. There would be connections in the subject matter that standard curricula would ignore despite the fact that they make the content easier to understand, enjoy, and RETAIN. I felt like fascinating and INTUITIVE concepts were almost intentionally being butchered into pages and pages of sleep-inducing text and monotonic, scripted lectures. I saw otherwise intelligent peers memorizing steps and formulas for the next exam without any sense of the intuition or big picture, only to forget everything within a matter of weeks. These videos are my expression of how the concepts should have been expressed in the first place, all while not compromising rigor or comprehensiveness.” · Our model is applicable to any learner - it can be used as the core learning platform or a supplementary one.\n\nThe YouTube comments Sal Khan received when he posted his first videos in 2006 are what motivated him to keep going (and create thousands more). However, it is still astonishing to see the impact our resources can have. If Khan Academy changed just one student's life, it would have been worth creating Khan Academy. The fact that this so easily scales to millions is what makes Khan Academy special. Khan Academy seems to work well with supplemental learners, but how well does it work in schools? We have always believed that a great teacher can take our resources and push learning to new heights, by better focusing on the individual needs of each student. With the student mastering core skills on the computer, the teacher can leverage the classroom time for more engaging and dynamic activities such as project-based learning, peer tutoring, or lively discussion.\n\nThe results so far have been promising. However, in our view, we’re just getting started. We still have a long way to go to reach our vision for technology-enabled education.

It seems the bee in your bonnet, however, has little to do with CC itself — it focusses narrowly on a certain ideology pertaining to the value of assessing what some refer to as “process standards” (a misnomer — they tend to refer only to cognitive processes): things that may be going on in a student’s mind, rather than what they can concretely accomplish on paper with the tools they’ve learned.

My dissertation will examine the opportunities students have to learn math online. In order to say something about the current state of the art, I decided to complete Khan Academy’s eighth grade year and ask myself two specific questions about every exercise: What am I asked to do?\n\nI find it more likely that Khan Academy’s exercise set draws an accurate map of the strengths and weaknesses of education technology in 2014. Khan Academy asks students to solve and calculate so frequently, not because those are the mathematical actions mathematicians and math teachers value most, but because those problems are easy to assign with a computer in 2014. Khan Academy asks students to submit their work as a number or a multiple-choice response, not because those are the mathematical outputs mathematicians and math teachers value most, but because numbers and multiple-choice responses are easy for computers to grade in 2014. This makes the limitations of Khan Academy’s exercises understandable but not excusable. Khan Academy is falling short of the goal of preparing students for success on assessments of the CCSS, but that’s setting the bar low. There are arguably other, more important goals than success on a standardized test.\n\nInteresting article… but Meyer’s analysis is skewed in that it analyzes what the students do in relation to the CCSS. It does not take into account: i) who the students are; ii)why they enroll; or iii) what they are trying to accomplish. Bottom line: would I pay private school tuition to enroll my kids in a school with the open standards of Khan Academy as a preparatory school for post secondary education? No. Would I use the Khan Academy as a cost effective supplement to cement the mechanical applications of concepts taught and then applied to real-world problems by trained and paid eighth grade teachers? Absolutely. ... I am also doing my dissertation work on Khan Academy. As said by Derek in comment 10, KA is not intended to be an all-in-one product. Sal Khan’s vision, as expressed in his book “The One-World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined,” is that KA be used to efficiently provide an environment for teaching procedural fluency not higher order skills.",

However, little research has been conducted on how learners perceive using…\n\nFounded by Salman Khan in 2008, KA is a Non-Profit Organization (NPO)- an open educational resource providing free, anywhere/anytime online learning content in simple English in different subjects, (Khan, 2020). The site offers over 5000 online instructional videos in disciplines such as calculus, biology, physics, computer programming, world history, and SAT practice, accompanied by real-time data and analysis features (Khan, 2018 Annual Report, 2018). In 2018, KA reported (Khan, 2018) 60 · The study followed the guidelines suggested by Twining, Heller, Nussbaum, and Tsai (2017). To ensure trustworthiness of the study method (Santiago-Delefosse, Gavin, Bruchez, Roux, & Stephen, 2016) a combination of two qualitative data collection methods was used. Qualitative results present students' perceptions of learning via KA drawn from interviews and logs.\n\nIn spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic thrust nearly 56 million students in the United States into remote education. By fall 2020, states' and school districts' differing public health measures resulted in the adoption of varying COVID-adapted learning modalities (i.e., in-person, remote, and hybrid). Using daily diary data with a nationally representative sample (N = 517, Mage = 14.65 years), we investigated whether adolescents' academic engagement and connectedness to their teachers and classmates differed by COVID-adapted learning modalities. We also assessed whether adolescent connectedness mediated the link between learning modality and academic engagement. Results revealed that academic engagement and connectedness to teachers and classmates were higher for in-person learners than for students in hybrid and remote learning modalities. Moreover, students’ connectedness to classmates and teachers explained the relationship between learning modality and academic engagement.\n\nIn service of the goal of examining how cognitive science can facilitate human–computer interactions in complex systems, we explore how cognitive psychology research might help educators better utilize artificial intelligence and AI supported tools as facilitatory to learning, rather than see these emerging technologies as a threat. We also aim to provide historical perspective, both on how automation and technology has generated unnecessary apprehension over time, and how generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT are a product of the discipline of cognitive science. We introduce a model for how higher education instruction can adapt to the age of AI by fully capitalizing on the role that metacognition knowledge and skills play in determining learning effectiveness. Finally, we urge educators to consider how AI can be seen as a critical collaborator to be utilized in our efforts to educate around the critical workforce skills of effective communication and collaboration.\n\nStudents using Khan Academy (KA) perceived themselves as independent learners. ... KA was perceived as encouraging independence, available, and more interesting compared to books. ... The importance of teacher presence as mediating cognitive and emotional learning is stressed. ... It is recommended that teachers apply KA creating and maintaining direct lines of interaction with students. It is argued that Khan Academy (KA) is a useful platform for learning math. However, little research has been conducted on how learners perceive using KA. The case study examined the effectiveness of KA combined with traditional learning, as perceived by secondary students (N = 27) in math. Qualitative tools included a reflective diary accompanied by semi-structured interviews. Main categories emerging from content analysis were the teacher, the student, teacher-student relations, subject and content, and learning environment.",

This study aims to reveal insights into the educational design of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in particular on their educational scalability: How do MOOCs provide interaction and formative feedback to high student numbers without being highly depending on the capacity of the teacher? We have applied a design analysis instrument that was specifically developed for large-scale online courses to analyse fifty MOOCs in a qualitative way. The goal of the analysis was to detect scalable best practices of formative feedback and interaction and focused on when, how and from whom s\n\nTo get more insight into the scalable best practices we also investigated on which complexity level they were provided. The analysis indicated scalable best practices on various complexity levels and across different learning activities. This shows that scalable formative feedback and interaction can be provided in MOOCs through different formats such quizzes, peer-feedback and simulations. The majority of the MOOCs in our sample provide student-content interaction during knowledge transfer activities (‘knows’). A selection of design examples is discussed as potentially best practices for educational scalability, not only for MOOCs but also for online education in general. While the study shows examples of scalable design choices in (open) online education, it also indicates a need for more elaborate interactions and feedback in MOOCs in order to improve their educational value and quality.",

Additionally, Khan Academy has recently been deemed one of the most damaging educational products to ever be created in the eyes of many teachers. The company markets its services ...\n\nOne of the main issues with Khan Academy is that it does not provide an adequate learning experience for students. The videos are cookie-cutter, impersonal, and lack any sort of teacher interaction. While the videos do provide an explanation of content, this is far from the whole teaching experience. With Khan Academy, students don’t experience the nuances and complexities of a classroom environment. They don’t receive feedback from the teacher or fellow students, nor do they get any personalized guidance. Another issue with Khan Academy is that it often does not align with the curriculum of a given school. While Khan Academy does offer some tutorials on more traditional topics such as math and science, it greatly favors more modern topics such as coding and technology. This makes it difficult for teachers to use Khan Academy as an effective supplement to their usual lesson plan.\n\nAnd even when they do use Khan Academy, they are still responsible for making sure that their students understand the material. The lack of alignment with the curriculum isn't the only problem. Khan Academy's assessment system is also based on multiple choice questions, which often do not accurately test a student's true knowledge. Multiple choice assessments are prone to guessing, and therefore give a false sense of understanding of the material. Finally, Khan Academy often encourages students to use it as a shortcut to learning material. While this does give students a leg-up on the material, it can often lead to cheating in class as students might submit answers from the Khan Academy assessment system. Overall, Khan Academy is a great resource for students who want to learn more about a certain subject, but it is far from an ideal learning environment for those attending formal classes.\n\nIt fails to provide an adequate learning experience for students and often does not align with the curriculum. Additionally, Khan Academy has recently been deemed one of the most damaging educational products to ever be created in the eyes of many teachers. The company markets its services as a solution to support teaching and learning, but in practice, teachers have reported significant and lasting negative effects. For this reason, teachers should carefully consider the repercussions of using Khan Academy in the classroom, as there are a number of serious implications that may have a lasting effect on students. I have typically used Khan Academy as an additional layer of instruction. I use the videos to introduce new topics and give additional information as needed. I then use the practice exercises and assessments to reinforce the material. With the practice exercises, I have found that students often quickly understand the concepts and can move on to further exploration.\n\nMy students are educated in a school where they are treated like adults, and they are taught adult practices. They do their core classes online (Math, Literature, Science, History), and teach themselves using wrtten lessons and informational videos that are provided by the teachers. They can finish their classes any time before the end of the semester, or if they so desire, procrastinate and leave themselves with a heavy work load in the end of the semester. Each student comes to school every day but Friday, to attend two in person electives of their choosing (Friday is reserved for online classwork). Most students will do some of their computer work at the school, in case they have any questions for their teachers. The online courses for math are mostly Khan academy, and every kid loves it. They moved from their normal public schools, came to my school, and loved every part of it.",

In a way typical of many Silicon Valley start-ups, Khan Academy staff were eager to iterate their product quickly, based in part on preliminary feedback they received from a variety of sources, including from users and from the researchers at SRI, and so doing something like a randomized control trial (RCT), considered the 'gold standard' evaluation technique in some quarters, was simply not practical. How do you evaluate something that is constantly evolving, and improving? This was a challenge faced by the SRI research team. 3. Implementation studies, as opposed to evaluation studies, should be considered more often by those wishing to learn from educational technology initiatives I really like that this SRI study is an implementation, not evaluation, study.\n\nOver the past five years, there has perhaps been no educational technology initiative that has been more celebrated around the world than the Khan Academy. Born of efforts by one man to provide tutoring help for his niece at a distance, in 2006 the Khan Academy became an NGO providing short video tutorials on YouTube for students. It is now a multi-million dollar non-profit enterprise, reaching over ten million students a month in both after-school and in-school settings around the world with a combination of offerings, including over 100,000 exercise problems, over 5,000 short videos on YouTube, and an online 'personalized learning dashboard'. Large scale efforts to translate Khan Academy into scores of languages are underway, with over 1000 learning items currently available in eleven languages (including French, Xhosa, Bangla, Turkish, Urdu, Portuguese, Arabic and Spanish).\n\nFounder Sal Khan's related TED video (\" Let's use video to reinvent education\") has been viewed over three million times, and the Khan Academy has been the leading example cited in support of a movement to ' flip the classroom', with video lectures viewed at home while teachers assist students doing their 'homework' in class. As efforts to distribute low cost computing devices and connectivity to schools pick up steam in developing countries around the world, many ministries of education are systematically thinking about the large scale use of digital educational content for the first time. Given that many countries have already spent, are spending, or soon plan to spend large amounts of money on computer hardware, they are often less willing or able to consider large scale purchases of digital learning materials -- at least until they get a better handle on what works, what doesn't and what they really need.\n\n5. No digital educational content repositories are 'comprehensive', no experience entirely immersive For many people scrolling through the vast store of mathematics materials on the Khan Academy site, it might appear at first glance that most 'everything' is covered. Over the past few years, Khan Academy has greatly built out its offerings, filling in content gaps and reorganizing the way some of the materials are presented and sequenced. Critics may argue about the utility and relevance of U.S. Common Core standards (there is no shortage of places on the Internet where you can find discussions on that topic, so I'll politely refer folks who like to engage in such discussions to other sites where they can post and argue about such things), but the standards have been of undeniable use in helping Khan Academy map out areas where additional content needed to be developed.",

UGS are increasingly seen as a potential solution for sustainable urban planning and development. Informal green spaces (IGS), even though they may make up a large share of UGS, are often overlooked in this regard. This study examines residents’ awareness of the ecosystem services provided by IGS and their need for redevelopment. The data were collected through structured interviews in the immediate vicinity of selected IGS in the Polish city of Łódź. Łódź is typical of post-industrial European cities struggling with environmental (heatwaves, cloudbursts), social (aging, depopulation) and spatial (a neglected and dense city center) issues. Our results show that residents saw IGS as places able to provide a range of services, mostly of the regulating type, and even minor design interventions can improve the attractiveness of IGS.\n\nUrban acupuncture is a term which can be traced back to the Finnish urbanist Marco Casagrande's (Casagrande, 2010) and the urban revivalist architect Jamie Lerner's ideas (Tortosa et al., 2010). It is the practice of making small targeted interventions – like that of the acupuncturist needle – in order to solve a specific larger problem. According to this idea, a city can be viewed as a living organism containing certain fulcrum points or places of high potential that begin to act as catalysts in the processes that go on to affect the entire city. In the urban acupuncture approach, the attention paid towards certain hotspots slowly starts driving the overall urban development. Here the main role is carried by local potentialities and no dramatic spatial change is necessary: typical examples include community-led activities with small budgets, often temporary in nature.\n\nBehaviour mapping is one of the tools which have received recent attention amongst a range of observation techniques used in landscape architecture, urban design, planning and other public or open space-related research. The task of any designer is to develop solutions that are aesthetically pleasing, practically useful and well-functioning (Lawson, 2005). As outdoor space is a “living environment”, observing how people use it is an efficient way of assessing the constant adaptation between people and space. Gathering empirical data by observational methods in the field provides a subject for design and also enables questions for research to be defined (Goličnik and Ward Thompson, 2010). Furthermore, as to Hofmann et al. (2012) claim, user preference should be a key criterion in the design of open spaces in order to assure that the design matches with people's expectations for the spaces.\n\nThe diversity of anthropogenic soil substrates leads to different plant communities. At the landscape scale, matrix composition and geographic connectivity between wastelands influence the biodiversity of wastelands, although to a lesser extent than the local features. We show that wastelands have a real potential to contribute to biodiversity conservation in urban regions. At the city scale, they represent habitats which urban planners need to take into account and include in dynamic urban planning. ...

Health-led FRIENDS was more effective in decreasing social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and total Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale scores as compared to school-led FRIENDS and PSHE. There were no intervention effects on math, reading, or writing standardized assessment test scores. Several studies implemented preventive interventions in the pre-kindergarten years.

Most interventions reviewed here included one non-healthcare sector collaborator as opposed to collaborating with communities more broadly. Examples of community-level interventions include CPIC, which involved 95 organizations in 5 sectors to develop community-wide plans for managing depression, and CTC that supports communities to develop multi-sector coalitions to prevent youth substance use, violence, and delinquency [35•, 103•]. Other studies acted at the community level by directly providing or influencing resources on a large scale, through cash/food transfers or land revitalization efforts [94, 105, 106•, 107•, 108,109, 110•]. A fifth group of interventions are health and public policies.\n\nInternational lay health worker interventions, a parenting intervention to reduce child abuse, a whole-school cognitive behavioral therapy prevention program, adapted ACT teams for early psychosis and justice-involved populations, Housing First services, and multi-sector collaborative care and prevention services are examples of effective community interventions. Studies indicate the importance of ongoing resources and training to maintain long-term outcomes and the need for policy reform to support healthcare-community partnerships. Future research should further define best practices for multi-sector collaborations and partnership structures, identify strategies for sustainable change after the end of research activities, and clarify the types of health and social problems that are best ameliorated through community interventions [2•]. In close and equitable partnerships with communities and policy leaders, future community interventions in mental health should seek to improve health\n\nCPIC was a group-level randomized study that compared two program-level quality improvement interventions: Community Engagement and Planning (CEP) and Resources for Services (RS). RS programs received a depression care toolkit with technical assistance and consultation to implement a community-wide approach to depression care. CEP programs received the same resources within a multi-sector coalition approach to co-leading, implementing, and monitoring multi-sector depression services (e.g., encouraging community programs to be active in psychoeducation and screening, with streamlined referrals to clinics and social services) [19]. CPIC’s community-partnered participatory research approach and development of community partnerships are described in detail in several articles [19–24]. Unlike many collaborative care studies, CPIC focused on a predominantly under-resourced racial/ethnic minority sample (n = 1018, 46% African American, 41% Latino, 74% with family incomes below federal poverty",

                "text": "Background Children’s physical inactivity is a persisting international public health concern. While there is a large body of literature examining physical activity interventions for children, the unique physical activity context of low-density communities in rural areas and smaller urban centres remains largely underexplored. With an influx of families migrating to rural communities and small towns, evaluations of health promotion efforts that support physical activity are needed to ensure they are meeting the needs of the growing populations in these settings. The aim of this community-based research was to explore service providers’ and parents’ perspectives on physical activity opportunities available in their community and recommendations toward the development and implementation of efficacious physical activity programming for children in rural communities and smaller urban centres.\n\nThis aligns with the idea that socioeconomic-based health inequalities increase across the life course because of the cumulative advantage or disadvantage associated with differential access to health-promoting resources, much of which is rooted in early life exposures [63]. While many recommendations for reducing the economic accessibility of physical activity surround affordable programs, one frequently reported barrier among rural populations is the shortage of free and low-cost physical activity opportunities [55]. The high cost of activities was also noted as a challenge for service providers. Local governments in smaller communities tend to face financial challenges with limited revenue, minimal financial capacity, and a high cost of living [15]. As a result, service providers have difficulties maintaining their facilities and creating environments that better support physical activity, which means regular free activity offerings are not a viable solution in many communities. In \n\nDespite community-based interventions having the potential to foster much-needed population-level changes in physical activity [23], the effective implementation and intended outputs of these programs are vulnerable to the context and can be hindered by a variety of complex individual, social, and environmental conditions [24]. Durlak and Dupre [25] suggest that understanding the factors that influence program uptake and adoption by a specific community can help close the gap between an evidence-based intervention plan and its effectiveness in a real-world context. Thus, prior to investing the funds necessary to scale-up this program to rural and smaller urban settings, the extent to which community members would find programs like the ACT-i-Pass suitable needs to be determined to ensure a tailored version of the program that is most likely to be used by the target population is offered.\n\nKahn EB, Ramsey LT, Brownson RC, Heath GW, Howze EH, Powell KE, et al.

                "text": "Finally, a fourth model of “community-based,” and the one least utilized in public health, is community as agent. Although closely linked to the model just described, the emphasis in this model is on respecting and reinforcing the natural adaptive, supportive, and developmental capacities of communities. In the language of Guy Steuart,8 communities provide resources for meeting our day-to-day needs. These resources are provided through community institutions including families, informal social networks, neighborhoods, schools, the workplace, businesses, voluntary agencies, and political structures. These naturally occurring units of solution meet the needs of many, if not most, community members without the benefit of direct professional intervention. However, communities are defined as much by whom they exclude as whom they include, and the network of relationships that defines communities may be under stress.\n\nHowever, social ecology is more than the idea that we can use interventions at multiple levels of the social system. It is also the idea that each level of analysis is part of an embedded system characterized by reciprocal causality. For example, individuals are affected by the families and informal networks of which they are members, and individual characteristics affect the social networks to which we have access. Moreover, our social networks are largely developed within the context of organizations and environments that bring us into contact with others. This suggests that ecological interventions may occur at one level and produce change or changes at others. We need to distinguish clearly between levels of intervention and targets of interventions,19 whether our focus is on behavioral change, strengthening units of solution, or building the civil society.\n\nThe goal of community-based programs in this model is to carefully work with these naturally occurring units of solution as our units of practice, or where and how we choose to intervene. This necessitates a careful assessment of community structures and processes, in advance, of any intervention. It also requires an insider’s understanding of the community to identify and work with these naturally occurring units of solution to address community problems. Thus the aim is to strengthen these units of solution to better meet the needs of community members. This approach may include strengthening community through neighborhood organizations and network linkages, including informal social networks, ties between individuals and the organizations that serve them, and connections among community organizations to strengthen their ability to collaborate.\n\nA number of dimensions of community capacity have been identified, among them skills and knowledge, leadership, a sense of efficacy, trusting relationships, and a culture of openness and learning.13 An understanding of the community’s ecology can lead to a better match with community-based health promotion interventions and can provide tools and resources unavailable from outside agents for making gains against complex public health problems like infant mortality, violence, substance abuse, and many others. More profoundly, an appreciation for community capacity shifts the paradigm underlying common intervention strategies to a focus on community building as a pathway to health. This may include conscious efforts to develop new and existing leadership, strengthen community organizations, and further community development and interorganizational collaboration.14 These efforts may require ensuring opportunities for community participation, strengthening relationships of trust and recipro",

Microfinance is a good example of an institution that has managed to do this but has come under increasing scrutiny for not delivering the transformative development benefits that its proponents promised.ref5 Instead, efforts to scale up programs should: Pay more attention to the quality of the bureaucracy and to improving management within government. The World Bank’s Bureaucracy Labref6 has been set up to facilitate this. Experiment with using technological solutions to deliver standardized products at scale. New technologies may enable replicable and scalable ways of maintaining quality while reaching large numbers of people.

A new working paper Toward Successful Development Policies: Insights from Research in Development Economics from the Bank’s research department captures 13 of the most significant insights in the world of development economics. Here’s insight #7 on the difficulty on implementing successful small interventions at a large scale. See all previous insights here: Thirteen insights for successful development policies · The last decade has seen a large increase in the number of policy evaluations, with many pilot programs tested rigorously for their impacts. This is a boon to governments looking to practice evidence-based policy making. However, even when pilots and local development interventions have proven very successful, they have often been difficult to scale up in a cost-effective way to achieve development impact on a large scale.\n\nA recent meta-analysis of more than 600 research papers covering 20 different types of development interventions found that the larger the study, the smaller the size of the effect, and that programs implemented by governments tend to have smaller effect sizes than academic or NGO-implemented programs.ref1 Moreover, several recent experiences provide stark examples of successful pilot programs not having the intended impacts when taken to scale: A first example comes from efforts to reform education in Kenyan primary schools by changing the way teachers are hired.ref2 New teachers offered a fixed-term contract by an international NGO significantly raised test scores. However, when the Kenyan government offered identical contracts, this produced zero impact. A second example is seen in efforts to help low-income agricultural workers in rural Bangladesh to be less vulnerable to seasonal food insecurity during the agricultural lean season.",

                "text": "With roughly half of the global population living in cities, urban environments become central to public health often perceived as health risk factors. Indeed, mental disorders show higher incidences in urban contexts compared to rural areas. ...\n\nTo tackle this shortcoming, the approach of co-creation offers a process in which participants jointly develop a solution without being the object of research or interview partners, but creators actively shaping their own environments (Jansen, 2018). Co-creation methods are increasingly used in urban planning (Mahmoud et al., 2021). Methods, e.g., from design research, can thus act as a vital link between urban planning and citizens. Using more practical or creative techniques (e.g., joint mapping of the built environment, photo-elicitation, Ortega-Alcázar and Dyck, 2012) than discursive techniques allows contributions from population groups that are otherwise often excluded from such processes (Leino and Puumala, 2021). Nevertheless, power imbalances need to be constantly addressed to avoid their reproduction (Leino and Puumala, 2021). Citizens’ local knowledge is valuable to identify potentials of the built environment of a city, e.g., favorite places for recreation that otherwise ar\n\nExplicitly gathering the individual preferences of different user groups can contribute to a better understanding of their needs (e.g., due to their cultural background). In general, innovative participatory approaches are multifaceted, from StreetArt Festivals (Allianz Vielfältige Demokratie, 2017) to joint construction of buildings in the public space (Leino and Puumala, 2021). To this end, design research, and in particular the approach of design thinking, offers a wide-ranging assortment of methods (Kumar, 2013; Frazer and Kroll, 2022), in which design as a practice of designing acts as a strategic facilitator that seeks collective solutions through inter- and transdisciplinary processes. Notably, small-scale interventions instead of large-scale projects offer a wide range of approaches that are cost-effective and quick to implement. The concepts of urban acupuncture and tactical urbanism both pursue these ideas, other frequently used terms are do-it-yourself urbanism or urban prot\n\nWhereas many other frameworks (e.g., Vollmer et al., 2020; Roe and McCay, 2021; Bornioli and Subiza-Pérez, 2022) eventually advocate for long term urban planning approaches to foster mental health, we aim at shedding light on smaller and easily implementable design interventions that make use of the given surroundings and its inherent potentials. Without neglecting the profound utility of approaches that are more comprehensive and include long term urban planning processes, this complementary concept allows cities to quickly address mental health and mental health literacy in a cost and time effective manner. In this article, we outline a framework for putting this idea into practice. Urban mental health is a complex topic that asks for interdisciplinary collaboration. In this article, we aim to integrate perspectives from (a) environmental and health psychology, (b) design research, and (c) urban planning. To that aim, we first draw on these disciplines’ theoretical stock, before we d\n\nAddressing mental health in such an accessible way and people being confronted with the subject in their everyday lives – both subconsciously (through the mere exposure of the design interventions on their way to work, to the supermarket, or to the playground) as well as consciously through explicit involvement in the interventions (e.g., reading of information) – may achieve normalization and thus lose the connotation of a taboo. In addition, better understanding symptoms of mental health problems might reduce stigmas through information (Corrigan and O’Shaughnessy, 2007). Aspects of simulation and immersion could further increase empathy with those affected and at the same time increase awareness for mental health issues in oneself and one’s surroundings. This element requires special attention to develop content that acknowledges the heterogenous user groups of urban public spaces, including people across all ages, from different cultural backgrounds as well as people facing mental ",

The second, less talked about objective is arguably the more important, certainly in the long run. It sets a somewhat ambiguous target of shifting decisionmaking power to local actors for 50 percent of development assistance over the next decade. Given USAID’s long-standing commitment to local solutions and the many practical methods and tools it has developed over the years to engage local leaders and institutions, the only question here is why the target is not much higher. While attention has focused on operational constraints, a bigger challenge will be changing the ingrained outlook and behavior of staff who have been brought up to look to the partner government as their primary counterpart, and who see the role of bilateral assis\n\nUnfortunately, these ex-post hypotheses to explain non-effectiveness do not prove that the interventions would be effective if designed with greater attention to local context. Some observers suggest that the successful performance of local implementing organizations under PEPFAR’s localization initiative provides evidence of the superiority of localization. The PEPFAR experience does demonstrate that local implementers, often with support from international implementers at the outset, can achieve the outcomes demanded by PEPFAR. This experience does not show that local implementation is more effective, however, just that it can be equally effective. The PEPFAR localization experience is also limited to local implementation, not local priority setting. The priorities are still very much set by PEPFAR. There are certainly evaluations of successful community driven (or community led) development programs.\n\nThat is not to say that we shouldn’t continue to examine the effectiveness of interventions. We want sustainable programs to be effective and effective programs to be sustainable. Effectiveness evidence should continue to inform program design such that locally designed programs integrate local knowledge with the best and most relevant available evidence. New programs should be rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness and continue to be evaluated at scale to ensure maintained effectiveness. Improved localization is also important for this process. Evaluations of pilot programs that closely mimic implementation at scale provide better predictions of effectiveness at scale. Thus, locally led and implemented pilot programs provide the best evidence about effectiveness and can also answer questions about sustainability. ... The three issues discussed below are intended as extensions to points raised in this thoughtful and constructive paper.\n\nOriginally conceived as a $5 billion per year program, the MCC manages a relatively small portion of U.S. foreign assistance—less than $1 billion of the $51 billion in total foreign aid (economic and military) in fiscal year 2020. Finally, the new approach fit with best practices (local ownership, transparency, accountability, rigorous use of data and evidence, independent evaluation) animating the development community, anchored in the concept of locally led development and soon to be adopted in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Subsequently, the gravity for change shifted to USAID. In the Obama administration, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah, responding to mission directors and other senior USAID staff, launched a major reform program emphasizing direct funding of local organizations. With USAID Forward and Local Solutions, Shah established an ambitious target of directing 30 percent of all USAID funding to local organizations, including partner governments.",

These initiatives typically involve a collaborative approach, bringing together community members, local organizations, and experts to develop tailored solutions [2]. Key principles of community interventions include: Empowerment: Enabling community members to take control of their circumstances. Participation: Involving residents in all stages of the intervention process. Capacity building: Enhancing local skills and resources to address ongoing challenges. Cultural competence: Respecting and integrating local values and practices. The overarching goal of community interventions is to improve the well-being of residents and create sustainable positive change. Specific objectives may vary depending on the community’s needs but often include reducing health disparities, improving educational outcomes, enhancing public safety, pro\n\nWhen thoughtfully integrated, technological solutions can streamline processes, improve data collection and analysis, and foster greater community engagement [8]. One of the most significant advantages of technology in community interventions is its capacity to facilitate real-time data collection and analysis. Mobile apps and digital surveys enable researchers and community workers to gather information quickly and efficiently, allowing for more responsive and adaptive interventions. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can map community assets and needs, providing visual representations that inform decision-making and resource allocation [9]. Social media platforms have revolutionized community engagement, offering new channels for outreach, education, and mobilization. These tools can amplify community voices, facilitate peer-to-peer support networks, and disseminate information rapidly. However, it’s crucial to develop strategies that bridge the digital divide and ensure equitable \n\nCommunity interventions can take various forms, depending on the issues being addressed and the resources available. Some common types include health promotion programs, environmental initiatives, youth development programs, economic empowerment projects, and social service coordination [3]. A critical first step in any community intervention is identifying the specific needs and priorities of the target population. Needs assessments help ensure that interventions are relevant, targeted, and likely to have a meaningful impact. These assessments typically involve a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to gather comprehensive data about community issues [4]. Key components of a community needs assessment include: Data collection: Gathering information through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and existing data sources. Asset mapping: Identifying community strengths and resources that can be leveraged.\n\nImplementing community interventions often comes with various challenges that need to be anticipated and addressed. Common obstacles include resistance to change, limited resources, and competing priorities within the community [12]. Strategies for overcoming these challenges include fostering community ownership, developing contingency plans, maintaining flexibility, addressing power imbalances, and celebrating small victories to maintain momentum. Evaluating the impact of community interventions is crucial for understanding their effectiveness, identifying areas for improvement, and demonstrating value to stakeholders. This process involves selecting appropriate outcomes and indicators that align with the intervention’s goals and objectives [13]. Effective evaluation relies on robust data collection methods that capture accurate and comprehensive information about the intervention’s impact.",

The present paper aimed (a) to provide a systematic review of the published literature regarding current practices of the scale development process, (b) to assess the main limitations reported by the authors in these processes, and (c) to provide a set of recommendations for best practices in future scale development research. Papers were selected in September 2015, with the search terms “scale development” and “limitations” from three databases: Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, with no time restriction. We evaluated 105 studies published between 1976 and 2015. The analysis considered the three basic steps in scale development: item generation, theoretical analysis, and psychometric analysis.

Measurement is a fundamental activity of science, since it enables researchers to acquire knowledge about people, objects, events, and processes. Measurement scales are useful tools to attribute scores in some numerical dimension to phenomena that cannot be measured directly. They consist of sets of items revealing levels of theoretical variables otherwise unobservable by direct means (DeVellis 2003). A variety of authors (Clark and Watson 1995; DeVellis 2003; Nunnally 1967; Pasquali 2010) have agreed that the scale development process involves complex and systematic procedures that require theoretical and methodological rigor.

It is increasingly apparent that performance gaps take root in the earliest years of children’s lives and do not vanish. It is thus critical that we assess the various aspects of early inequities in both the home and paid care/school contexts. This three-part study combines a statistical analysis of current early gaps and changes over time in the gaps with a qualitative study of multifaceted \n\nDistricts also take different approaches based on density. New York City—home to dozens of full-service community schools supported by the Children’s Aid Society and rapidly expanding to more—and Boston—home to the City Connects initiative—leverage a broad range of their respective cities’ arts and cultural offerings, along with health and nutrition and other social services (Weiss 2016g, 2016h). Cultural offerings to supplement other well-rounded services are also part of the full-service community schools district initiative in Vancouver, Washington. In contrast, Partners for Education, which serves the isolated region surrounding Berea College in Kentucky, was the first rural organization to receive a Promise Neighborhood grant and, thus, is a pioneer in exploring how well the model works outside the urban context (Berea College 2013).\n\nSimilarly, gaps in approaches to learning as reported by parents and in self-control as reported by teachers did not change significantly, and gaps in approaches to learning as reported by teachers and in self-control as reported by parents shrank by roughly the same amount as the reading gap (about a tenth of a standard deviation—0.12 and 0.08 sd, respectively). Figure A provides a graphic illustration of the unadjusted gaps in cognitive and noncognitive skills of high- and low-SES children across the two cohorts. The additional models estimated for each outcome and shown in Tables 3 and 4 offer other key findings. In Model 1, we used the full samples for the two cohorts but did not include any controls that capture characteristics of children or their parents or the early education practices in which families engage. Model 2 partitions the data into schools and classes, or clusters, so that the subjects in the clusters are more similar to one another than to those in other groups. Un\n\nEducation researchers and policymakers have long been attentive to issues related to equity—by race/ethnicity, SES, gender, and other characteristics. At least since the 1966 publication of the “Coleman Report” by sociologist James S. Coleman and coauthors, researchers and policymakers have understood the critical impacts of race, poverty, and segregation on educational attainment (Coleman et al. 1966). And educational inequities remain a major problem today. Rigorous research demonstrates that inequalities in both opportunity and outcomes along the lines of race and social class begin early and often persist throughout students’ K–12 years and beyond, and that they are much larger in the United States than in comparable countries (Bradbury et al. 2015; Putnam 2015). Some of the research carefully describes the specific contexts and challenges that minority and lower-social-class students face and how these challenges create early education gaps.\n\nFor cognitive skills, the associations are statistically significant and negative, though stronger and somewhat more meaningful or more intense with reading achievement (-0.12 sd in 1998) than with math achievement (-0.04 sd).21 These associations did not intensify nor weaken over time. For noncognitive skills the associations are highly positive and statistically significant, and very strong for parents’ assessment of approaches to learning (0.29 sd in 1998). As explained by García (2015), these correlations between “other activities” and noncognitive skills as assessed by parents could be bidirectional: engaging children in enrichment activities might enhance their noncognitive skills, but, at the same time, parents who are more inclined to participate in their children’s early play and educational time are probably more likely to perceive or judge that their engagement has an impact on their children’s skills.",

Based on the rationale, it is imperative to look at the curriculum from the lens of multicultural education because Indonesia is a diverse country. A curriculum that is responsive to the cultures in education setting would enhance the equality in education that eventually education for all can be achieved. This study employed systematic literature review as reseach method. The researcher examined literatures about related to culturally responsive teaching and the evidence of educational problems that currently happens from current published journals as well as important books related to culturally responsive teaching.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to introduce a new framework for fast and effective knowledge state assessments in the context of personalized, skill-based online learning. We use knowledge state networks - specific neural networks trained on assessment data of previous learners - to predict the full knowledge state of other learners from only partial information about their skills. In combination with a matching assessment strategy for asking discriminative questions we demonstrate that our approach leads to a significant speed-up of the assessment process - in terms of the necessary number of assessment questions - in comparison to standard assessment designs. In practice, the presented methods enable personalized, skill-based online learning also for skill ontologies of very fine granularity without deteriorating the associated learning experience by a lengthy assessment process.",

Defined as the shared beliefs, practices, symbols, and norms within a society, cultural values influence how individuals perceive and engage with learning environments. In diverse classrooms, educators face the challenge of addressing cultural mismatches, where the values of students' home cultures differ from those of mainstream educational settings. This can lead to disparities in academic achievement, particularly for minority students. To mitigate these challenges, culturally relevant teaching strategies have been developed, emphasizing the importance of integrating students' cultural backgrounds into the curriculum. Notable frameworks, such as Hofstede's cultural dimensions, provide insights into how various cultural aspects—like power distance and individualism—affect classroom dynamics.\n\nSince culture is the context in which we live and the manner in which we are socialized, the idea of cultural values refers to what drives our performance and our actions. Cultural values are the beliefs, practices, symbols, specific norms, and personal values that we share as a society. What one perceives is then shaped by his or her experiences and the cultural values to which his society adheres. In addition, the ways in which institutions are organized express their underlying cultural values (Sagiv & Schwartz, 2000, 2007; Schwartz, 1999, 2004, 2007, 2010; Curry, Meyer, & McKinney, 2006). Take, for example, the U.S. legal system and the way it is designed to have the prosecution and defense lawyers challenge one another for a conviction or acquittal. Or the design of the family system in which the major emphasis placed on parents is to rear achievement-oriented children.\n\nCulture: Culture is the context in which we live and the manner in which we are socialized. Diversity: Diversity is the wide range of differences among people, communities, and families based on cultural and ethnic backgrounds, physical abilities and academic abilities. In-group: In-group is a sociological term used to describe a group that people identify with and feel some form of attachment to. In many instances, the attachment is based on opposition toward \"out-groups. Out-group: Out-group refers to a group of individuals in which members of an in-group harbor a sense of opposition, resistance and even sometimes hatred toward. Out-groups are required for in-groups to exist. Values-based Education: Values-based education is the inclusion of moral and ethical values that make a person believe he or she is in line with the norm. Values: Values are the guidelines that describe how we as people should behave and how organizations should perform.\n\nHollins and Oliver (1999) call this phenomenon a cultural mismatch. A cultural mismatch occurs when the culture of the learning environment is different from that of the home culture of the child, and learning is adversely affected. Academic achievement for the out-group (minority students) is compromised by the relationship between the home and school culture. For the in-group, in this case the White students, academic achievement flourishes. Cummins and Entwistle (2005) explain that this situation is even more prevalent for adolescent minority students. Studies find that by age eight, enthusiasm for learning and self confidence in the ability to learn could be significantly negatively affected due to the cultural mismatch between their school and home cultural values. Such a mismatch is often created by culturally incompetent education administrators and most particularly, culturally incompetent teachers.",

Although there are many different cultures within the United States, the education system’s definition of what is “appropriate behavior” typically reflects white, middle-class cultural norms and values. These norms are reflected in broader school district practices and policies, as well as classroom expectations around behavior, communication, classroom dynamics, and family engagement. This can result in a cultural gap. In education, a cultural gap refers to any significant disparity in world views, values, and expectations that exist between a teacher (or the school culture as a whole) and racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse students. Often times, these disparities negatively impact the success of these student populations.\n\nBecause cultural gaps can impact engagement with students, teachers should create a classroom where students’ cultures are acknowledged, respected, and reflected. They can do this by implementing culturally sustaining practices—practices that not only accept but foster students’ cultural norms and values. These practices are designed to recognize and bridge cultural gaps and represent a shift from the traditional focus of schools, where students are expected to adopt white, middle class norms and to change or shed behaviors that don’t align with the school’s or teacher’s expectations. Although culturally sustaining practices may look different depending on the context, teachers can: Many districts have cultural liaisons and community outreach specialists with personal knowledge and understanding of the cultures represented in the community.\n\nTo learn more about cultural influences on behavior and how demographic differences can lead to cultural gaps that negatively impact students, we encourage you to listen to Lori Delale-O’Connor in this extended IRIS Interview. In addition, she offers examples of how teachers can implement culturally sustaining practices to create inclusive classrooms where all students feel supported. ... Even teachers who believe that they engage in culturally sustaining practices can benefit from taking the time to reflect on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices.

Adapted from “Double-Check: A Framework of Cultural Responsiveness Applied to Classroom Behavior,” by P. A. Hershfeldt, R. Sechrest, K.\n\nA culture gap that I’ve experienced with one of my students, a young lady, and she was explaining the quinceañera to me, which I’d heard of the term. I understood it was a party. The pieces I didn’t understand was it’s very intricate. It’s almost the pieces of a wedding for this young lady who’s turning 15. My student was not turning 15. She was going to be in the quinceañera, but she would come in every day explaining: They went for their dress fitting. They had to pick out their colors, their shoes, their fingernails. And she was sharing in a small-group setting. And it was interesting to see the interplay between the other three students and this young lady. They were asking questions. I was asking questions. She was very open and super excited to share with us all the pieces that were going into this quinceañera, and the other students had wonderful questions.",

                "text": "The thing is, there’s a reason that standardization takes hold in so many domains. Agreeing on a common standard enables collaboration by many entities without any need for explicit agreements or coordination. The existence of the ANSI/SAE J563 standard automobile auxiliary power outlet (AKA “car cigarette lighter”) didn’t just allow many manufacturers to make replacement lighter plugs. The existence of a standardized receptacle delivering standardized voltage to standardized contacts let all kinds of gadgets be designed to fit in that socket. Standards crystallize the space of all possible ways of solving a problem into a range of solutions. This inevitably has a downside, because the standardized range might not be optimal for all applications. Think of the EU’s requirement for USB-C charger tips on all devices. There’s a lot of reasons that manufacturers prefer different charger tips for different gadgets.\n\nThe standardization of American education has produced all the downsides of standardization — a rigid, often suboptimal, one-size-fits-all system — without the benefits. With teachers across America teaching in lockstep, often from the same set texts (especially in the AP courses), there’s a massive opportunity for a commons to go with the common core. For example, the AP English and History classes my kid takes use standard texts that are often centuries old and hard to puzzle out. I watched my kid struggle with texts for learning about “persuasive rhetoric” like 17th century pamphlets that inspired anti-indigenous pogroms with fictional accounts of “Indian atrocities.” · It’s good for American schoolkids to learn about the use of these blood libels to excuse genocide, but these pamphlets are a slog. Even with glossaries in the textbooks, it’s a slow, word-by-word matter to parse these out.",

                "text": "Six strategies for building the strong relationships with students that are the heart of a culturally inclusive classroom community.\n\nIt’s imperative that students and teachers know each other beyond the subjective cultural experiences that each may bring to the classroom, and that educators possess an understanding of diverse cultures but not stereotype people into a one-size-fits-all cultural mold. Students need to be related to as full, complex, multidimensional people. To achieve this desired objective, school leaders and classroom teachers should view their school or classroom spaces as culturally inclusive classroom communities where everyone is welcome. When we talk about the dynamics of creating a culturally inclusive classroom community, the typical focus is on the diversity of the students in the room or school building. All too often the culture and diversity of the adults are on the periphery. But in order to navigate the intersection of student and adult cultural diversity, we must first acknowledge and understand our adult beliefs and practices.\n\nThis thinking requires educators to be willing to explore and analyze our own history and its effects on our behavior. First we must consider our historical and current living situations and conditions. When we examine our childhood, young adult, and present-day lives, we examine how our experiences influence us today and how they might have an effect on our work with children and families who have vastly different experiences. While culture refers to a collective worldview, schools as culturally inclusive communities must relate to individual students first in addressing the distinct needs of the students who make up the those communities. I’ve used several relationship-building approaches that I feel could help educators and students successfully navigate the cultural intersection of the school community. 1. Learn your students’ names and learn to pronounce them.\n\nTo create culturally inclusive classroom communities, both teachers and students build relationships with each other. Students are motivated by teachers they respect. Teachers show genuine care and concern for students by holding them accountable and by acknowledging their good work. And teachers who show that they care are more successful in reaching students. An elementary-school-age student may not be able to articulate his or her specific needs as they relate to learning and safety. However, student behavior may indicate which path the teacher should take to address what is in the student’s best interest.\n\nSo the student is the navigator and the teacher is the driver at this cultural crossroad.",

This Brief Report proposes an empowerment of local sustai\n\nThe United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to advance the cause of social and environmental sustainability at a global level through international cooperation. The SDGs certainly...\n\nSuch global networks of local actors would need to be globally accessible and inclusive to ensure that developing countries are not left behind. As Rahman, Khan, and Sadique (Citation2020, 1) point out, “in localization of the SDGs and ensuring disaggregated and inclusive implementation of the goals, Asia [for example,] is facing formidable challenges both at regional and sub-regional levels.” What would such a global and fully inclusive bottom-up process of data aggregation and solution-sharing look like? It would no doubt be digitally driven, and it would be designed to meet the following needs. Based on the understanding of the global and national politics of sustainability transformation I have gained from two decades as an executive of various key science institutions and a science advisor, as well as more than thirty years of research as an anthropologist with local actors in developing countries, it seems to me that the following seven essential prerequisites must be met for SDG\n\nSuch a prescriptive monitoring system may still seem like a hopeful prospect to some but more like a potential nightmare to others and, in any case, it remains a dream, far removed from the realities of even the most highly developed and SDG-supportive regions in the world. For example, the European Commission’s Joint Research Center published the “European Handbook for SDG Voluntary Local Reviews” in 2020, and by February 2021 some 24 local city governments had submitted voluntary local reports (VLRs) in response, though only 16 of these documents included some kind of indicator and data analysis. The relevant European Union (EU) report notes that the challenge lies in “providing a framework to inspire the selection of appropriate indicators, making reviews both comparable across Europe and targeting local situations and challenges” (Ciambra, Siragusa, and Proietti Citation2021, 6).\n\nFor example, Kawakubo and Murakami (Citation2020, 1) report on experiments in Hokkaido and Kyushu, Japan, with building a “local SDGs Platform that enables stakeholders to register, search and share their efforts and best practices toward achieving the SDGs.” The researchers found that “only 5% of global SDG indicators proposed by United Nations Statistics Division could be used without modification at the local level in Japan.…However, approximately 50% of global SDG indicators could be used after localization.” Such experiments are few, and even fewer are designed to map the solutions space by capturing local innovations. For example, the SDG Portal developed by the German Association of Cities and the Bertelsmann Foundation, at least for now, is more focused on measuring and comparing achievements relating to SDG indicators than facilitating peer-to-peer sharing of ideas within the solutions space.Footnote1 Meanwhile, efforts led by local government networks themselves to help local",

Although the SDGs offer a shared language and a standard set of indicators for measuring development, the current level of progress reveals no one-size-fits-all model of success.\n\nAccording to the Sustainable Development Report 2024, “on average, only 16 percent of the SDG targets are on track to be met globally by 2030, with the remaining 84 percent showing limited progress or a reversal of progress” [1]. Furthermore, research has indicated that approximately 65% of SDG targets are directly tied to the responsibilities of local and regional governments [2], underlining the “urgent need to accelerate SDG localization to improve policy coherence and integration” [3]. Achieving such goals requires efforts beyond simply aligning national and local policies with them; there is a need to foster incentives for innovation, partnerships, and co-designed solutions that reflect each locality’s unique challenges and opportunities [4].

The challenge lies in reconciling the global sustainability agenda with unique local conditions during implementation. The existing literature on SDG localization acknowledges these tensions but struggles to provide a clear way forward. The solution involves exploring opportunities and drawing from the untapped potential within emerging networks of local actors. There is a need to advocate for a global empirical data aggregation on local sustainable solutions, complementing the top-down SDG agenda. The key proposal is to address the diversity of local needs by leveraging the diversity of local solutions through lifestyle changes, confirming sustainable consumption and production patterns, One Health, and leveraging global digital infrastructure.\n\nThe commitment to sustainable development, outlined in the G20 High-Level Principles on Lifestyles for Sustainable Development, calls for robust collective actions to promote the global adoption of sustainable production and consumption patterns. Specific actions include the active implementation of the G20 High-Level Principles, support through international cooperation and financial aid, encourage International Organizations to incorporate the HLPs into their programmes, and endorsement of initiatives like \"Travel for LiFE\", all emphasize the necessity of collaborative global efforts and supportive policies for attaining a sustainable and environmentally conscious future (G20 India 2023b). Furthermore, under India’s Presidency of G20, a unique task force on LiFE has been constituted under the T20 process: Task Force 3 on LiFE, Resilience and Values for Well-being. The Task Force addresses global challenges undermining SDGs, including poverty, food security, health, and well-being, em\n\nRecognizing the persistent challenges in attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in developing nations, there is a growing consensus on integrating SDGs into economic and social frameworks, promoting sustainable and lasting advancement. India's COP26 initiative, \"Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE),\" champions the cause of sustainable livelihoods and lifestyles harmonized with both planetary and human well-being. This reflects a broader paradigm shift towards holistic indicators that encompass environmental responsibility, social inclusivity, and the overall welfare of individuals and the planet. The next two sections delve into the practical implementation of LiFE within the unique context of Intermediary Cities, highlighting its multifaceted strategies to address the complex urban dynamics and the integration of Triangular Cooperation, recognized by G20 members as a pivotal aspect enriching the practical application of LiFE.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remain the most recognizable framework of collective global action towards sustainable development and well-being, and all attendant benefits of equity, shared prosperity, nature rejuvenation, One Health, global cooperation, and citizen partnership, ideally conforming to sustainable consumption and production. With many of the G20 countries involved in formalizing the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and developing the global indicator framework, the grouping exhibits proactive and strong leadership in localizing and implementing the SDGs. This commitment is driven by the alignment of globally agreed goals with the national development agenda. The adoption of the SDGs has prompted a global shift towards localizing these objectives. This entails transferring the implementation of SDG-related actions from national governments to local levels.",

This requires a ‘whole-of-society’’ approach and a transformation in how public institutions, private sector organizations, and individual citizens collaborate to advance sustainable development. Hence, localizing the SDGs cannot be limited to translating and integrating the global goals into local development and investment plans but must extend to creating incentives for public and private stakeholders to collaborate, innovate, and co-design solutions.

The key question addressed by this baseline document is how SDG localization can be practically, efficiently, and effectively implemented in what remains of the Decade of Action. Efraim Hernández, Mario Cárdenas, Ivonne Lobos Alva, Angélica Guerra, Åsa Gerger Swartling, Juan Camilo Betancur Jaramillo, Somya Joshi, Kuntum Melati, Romanus Opiyo, Dayoon Kim, Leonie Pearson, Nhilce N. Esquivel, George Njoroge, Filippa Ek / Published on 29 October 2021 ... Hernández Orozco, E., Cárdenas, M., Lobos Alva, I., Guerra, A., Gerger Swartling, Å., Betancur, J., Joshi, S., Melati, K., Otieno Opiyo, R., Kim, D., Pearson, L., Esquivel, N.\n\nIn many ways, achieving the SDGs is directly linked to the capacity of local and regional governments to ensure access to basic services that underpin the quality of life. A predominant finding in the research conducted is how the current pandemic has set back parts of the progress made on the 2030 Agenda and made the delivery of services more difficult. Moreover, COVID-19 has demonstrated the crucial role local and regional governments play, taking powerful decisions in exceptional circumstances. As we move forward, strategic decisions need to be carefully designed to determine the way cities and regions continue to respond to the pandemic around the world and how they plan to reconstruct and improve their communities. To inform these decisions and to help guide international organizations’ support, this baseline has uncovered the important challenges and opportunities for the local implementation of the SDGs that relate to the broader themes of advocacy, action, and monitoring.\n\nFirst, local actors in several countries are finding it difficult to engage in stages at the national, regional, and global levels where priority setting, programming, and funding are discussed and decided. Second, there is the danger that the SDGs may not be achieved by 2030, and the current pandemic has caused regression concerning some of the goals. Third, systemic interactions between targets must be considered for effective policy design and implementation. Finally, one key issue is the lack of benchmarking of the 2030 Agenda implementation. A key barrier to effective localization is often found in weak institutions and systems of governance. While countries face different governance constraints at different stages of their development, the importance of responsive, inclusive, and accountable governance systems for SDG localization cannot be understated.\n\nActors face a lack of harmony and standardization of tracking, monitoring systems, and methods for assessing progress on the SDGs, which hinders comparability, especially when comparing in localities. Moreover, challenges appear when local actors attempt to define “local” as a purely jurisdictional category, as the movement of people, goods, and services increases interdependence between territories, and administrative boundaries for monitoring indicators are increasingly blurred. Finally, there are difficulties due to the lack of inclusion of communities living on the edges of cities and possible ways to integrate their needs into localization strategies. Corrections, June 2024: This report was revised at the request of the UN to offer participating local and regional governments the possibility of reviewing their case studies. Corrections were made in the cases of Bangkok, Bristol and Malmö.",

This Indian model of SDG localization is built around four foundational pillars: (i) creating institutional ownership; (ii) driving competition through collaborative competition; (iii) building capacities; (iv) adopting a whole-of-society approach. Given that under the Constitution of India, most of the responsibility for SDG themes lies with subnational governments and that their combined expenditure spending is often more than that of the central government, the 28 states and eight union territories (UTs) play a pivotal role in delivering the agenda.

students perceive Khan Academy as independent learning but stress importance of teacher presence as mediating cognitive and emotional learning | Multiple studies | Community-embedded learning with cultural relevance | Cultural mismatches occur when learning environment differs from home culture, adversely affecting learning for minority students |\n| | 40% of Khan Academy exercises focus on calculating/solving vs. only 25% on actual assessments; 74% produce numbers or multiple-choice responses | Research analysis | Teachers who understand local context | By age 8, enthusiasm for learning can be significantly negatively affected by cultural mismatch between school and home |\n| | Majority of MOOCs focus on factual knowledge; student-content interaction most common, rare examples of deep interaction and feedback | Educational scalability study | Differentiated, culturally sustaining practices | One-size-fits-all fails to accommodate vast diversity of societal needs, overlooks context-specific education responsive to local realities |\n| **Development Interventions** | Larger studies show smaller effect sizes; government-implemented programs have smaller effects than NGO/academic programs | Meta-analysis of 600+ studies | Community-driven development with local ownership | Locally led programs with local implementation provide best evidence about effectiveness and sustainability |\n| | Kenyan teacher reform: NGO contracts raised test scores significantly, identical government contracts produced zero impact | Specific case study | Community as agent model: respecting and reinforcing natural adaptive, supportive, developmental capacities of communities | Community intervention research |\n| | Difficulty maintaining quality at scale | Even highly successful pilot programs difficult to scale cost-effectively; quality depends heavily on trainers | Small-scale urban interventions (urban acupuncture) | Small-scale interventions are cost-effective, quick to implement; address mental health in accessible way through community involvement |\n| **SDG Implementation** | SDG implementation in India follows top-down approach, but to achieve targets, bottom-up approach should be followed | India case study | Localized SDG adaptation | Only 5% of global SDG indicators could be used without modification at local level in Japan; 50% could be used after localization |\n| | Only 16% of SDG targets on track globally; 84% showing limited progress or reversal | 2024 SDG Report | Local government leadership | 65% of SDG targets directly tied to responsibilities of local/regional governments |\n| | Lack of harmony in tracking/monitoring systems; difficulties defining \"local\" as purely jurisdictional; lack of inclusion of edge communities | SDG localization baseline | Context-specific implementation | Need for implementations reflecting local realities, challenges, and capacities; cities as active drivers, not just implementation sites |\n| **Impact Investing** | Few solutions meeting fundamental needs of poor will get money back; scalable rural livelihoods, basic health, education, clean water - you don't make money off this | Mulago Foundation | Cooperative/solidarity models | Cooperatives generate $2.2 trillion globally, employ 10% of world's employed population; more resilient, lower failure rates |\n| | Small/new social enterprises fail to meet impact investor requirements: can't demonstrate healthy financial records, realistic projections, strategies to scale | South Africa research | Revenue-sharing / mutual aid structures | Renewable energy cooperatives show diverse scaling strategies; mutual interest can lead to \"scale-out\" and \"scale-deep\" rather than just \"scale-up\" |\n| **Standardization Effects** | American education has all downsides of standardization - rigid, suboptimal, one-size-fits-all - without benefits | Analysis of US education | Locally adaptive solutions | Communities proactively developing community ventures and scaling community movement through infrastructure shift, nurturing, sustaining |\n\n---\n\n## PROBLEMS → OPPORTUNITIES FRAMEWORK\n\n### Problem Space 1: **THE KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER GAP**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Students using Khan Academy perceive themselves as independent learners but stress that teacher presence mediates both cognitive and emotional learning\n- MOOCs provide primarily student-content interaction; rare examples of deep interaction and formative feedback\n- Mega platforms optimize for what computers can easily grade (numbers, multiple-choice) not what humans actually need to learn\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Community Learning Networks**: Create peer-to-peer learning systems where Bloom teams teach each other based on complementary expertise\n→ **Embedded Mentorship**: Your Lebanese AI team could mentor Mary Claire's Cameroon team on using technology, while she mentors them on community engagement\n→ **Contextual Knowledge Exchange**: Instead of standardized curricula, facilitate knowledge transfer that respects local context and builds on existing cultural practices\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 2: **THE SCALE PARADOX**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Meta-analysis of 600+ research papers found larger studies have smaller effect sizes; programs implemented by governments have smaller effects than academic/NGO programs\n- Quality deteriorates when moving from pilot to scale because context, relationships, and nuance get lost\n- The pressure to \"scale\" forces standardization which kills the very thing that made the solution work\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Horizontal Federation Instead of Vertical Scale**: Like Mondragon's federation of worker cooperatives spanning various sectors with democratic decision-making\n→ **Franchise the Process, Not the Solution**: Share the methodology (how to do community needs assessment, how to co-design with users) not the exact program\n→ **Scale Through Replication**: Help 50 communities build their own Mary Claire-style initiatives rather than forcing Mary Claire to become a multinational corporation\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 3: **THE CULTURAL MISMATCH CRISIS**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Cultural mismatch occurs when learning environment culture differs from home culture; by age 8, enthusiasm for learning and self-confidence can be significantly negatively affected\n- One-size-fits-all approach overlooks importance of context-specific education responsive to local environmental, cultural, socio-economic realities\n- Global solutions impose Western middle-class norms as \"appropriate behavior\"\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Culturally-Embedded Solutions**: Bloom teams ARE the solution to this - they're proximate, they understand cultural context, they design WITH not FOR communities\n→ **Localization as Innovation**: Help teams articulate how their \"non-scalable\" cultural specificity is actually their competitive advantage\n→ **Anti-Portfolio**: Create case studies showing why certain solutions SHOULD NOT be replicated elsewhere because context matters\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 4: **THE TOP-DOWN TRAP**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- SDG implementation follows top-down approach but to achieve targets, bottom-up approach needed\n- Only 5% of global SDG indicators could be used without modification at local level; 50% could be used after localization\n- Currently only 16% of SDG targets on track; 84% showing limited progress or reversal\n- Global frameworks ignore that 65% of SDG targets are tied to local/regional government responsibilities\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Bottom-Up SDG Implementation**: Position Bloom as SDG localization infrastructure - you're the bridge between global goals and local reality\n→ **Local Indicator Development**: Help teams develop their own success metrics that matter to their communities, not just donor-friendly KPIs\n→ **Proof of Concept for Localization**: Use your 10-11 teams to demonstrate that locally-led, context-specific approaches outperform standardized interventions\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 5: **THE FUNDING CLIFF**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Solutions meeting fundamental needs of poor won't get money back - rural livelihoods, basic health, education, clean water\n- Small social enterprises fail to meet impact investor requirements: can't demonstrate financial track records, projections, scale strategies\n- Accelerator → investor pipeline is broken for enterprises serving poor communities with thin margins\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Alternative Capital Structures**: Build what renewable energy cooperatives demonstrate - diverse scaling strategies including \"scale-out\" and \"scale-deep\" not just vertical growth\n→ **Prove Resilience Over Returns**: Cooperatives have lower failure rates, especially after startup phase, and greater resilience in downturns\n→ **Redefine Success**: Create measurement framework showing that 10 sustainable $100k/year businesses serving 1000 people each is more valuable than 1 venture-backed company serving 10,000 people extractively\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 6: **THE IMPLEMENTATION DESERT**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Kenyan education reform: NGO-offered contracts raised test scores, identical government contracts = zero impact\n- Local actors find it difficult to engage at national/regional/global levels where priority-setting, programming, funding are decided\n- Even successful pilots fail at scale because the \"how\" matters as much as the \"what\"\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Implementation Community of Practice**: Your 18-month EG fellowship creates peer learning network where teams troubleshoot implementation together\n→ **Document the Invisible Work**: Capture the relationships, trust-building, cultural negotiation that makes programs work - the stuff that doesn't show up in logic models\n→ **Implementation Toolkit**: Create resources not for replicating solutions but for adapting implementation strategies to new contexts\n\n---\n\n### Problem Space 7: **THE AGENCY VACUUM**\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Communities are defined as much by whom they exclude as whom they include; network of relationships may be under stress\n- Top-down interventions treat communities as beneficiaries, not agents\n- Localization is not merely top-down implementation but dynamic process aligning global goals with local governance structures, actors, tools\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n→ **Community as Agent**: Use the model that respects and reinforces natural adaptive, supportive, developmental capacities of communities\n→ **Shift Power**: Your solidarity fund literally shifts decision-making power - teams decide together how to allocate resources, not external investors\n→ **Build Civil Society**: Create lasting infrastructure for community self-organization that outlives any individual program or funding cycle\n\n---\n\n## KEY INSIGHTS FOR YOUR APPLICATION:\n\n**The Meta-Argument:**\nThe entire social impact sector has confused \"scale\" with \"impact.\" We've imported Silicon Valley's growth metrics into contexts where they don't apply. The result: we fund solutions that look good in PowerPoints but fail in practice, while defunding precisely the embedded, contextual, relational work that actually transforms communities.\n\n**Your Competitive Advantage:**\nBloom's \"weakness\" (that your teams won't scale like tech startups) is actually your strength. You're building the infrastructure the sector is missing - the persistent, community-embedded, culturally-specific support that outlasts any single funding cycle.\n\n**Frame It As:**\nNot \"small is beautiful\" nostalgia, but evidence-based pragmatism. The research shows local, contextual, community-led solutions outperform standardized interventions. You're not being anti-scale; you're being pro-effectiveness.\n\nWant me to help you craft specific application language using this framework?",

The meta-critique of scale paradox, combined with funding cliff realities and cultural embeddedness, creates a powerful analytical lens. This approach illuminates systemic challenges while maintaining a deeply human-centered perspective.\n\nThe big problem in the social impact sector reveals complex interconnected dynamics that demand innovative, holistic solutions.\n\nThe sector's scale-driven mindset fundamentally misunderstands community transformation. By creating funding mechanisms that marginalize culturally embedded enterprises, current approaches perpetuate structural inequities. Our proposed alternative infrastructure centers mutual aid and solidarity economy principles, directly challenging these systemic limitations.\n\nThis strategy synthesizes critical theoretical critiques, lived experience narratives, and robust research evidence into a coherent, actionable 18-month intervention aligned with transformative systems change principles.Looking at your priorities, the research strength, and what will actually work for an 18-month fellowship, here's my sharp recommendation:\n\n## THE WINNING COMBINATION: Scale Paradox + Funding Cliff + Cultural Embeddedness\n\n**Why this trio:**\n1. Strongest research backing (meta-analysis of 600+ studies)\n2. Sharpest critique of current system (directly challenges Winners Take All)\n3. Best match to YOUR lived experience (Mary Claire, your 10-11 teams)\n4. Most actionable for 18 months\n5. Perfectly aligned with EG's equity/systems change mission\n\n---\n\n## YOUR CORE ARGUMENT (One Paragraph Version)\n\nThe social impact sector has imported Silicon Valley's scale-at-all-costs logic, but meta-analysis of 600+ development interventions shows larger studies have smaller effect sizes, and government-scaled programs underperform local implementations. This creates a funding cliff for social enterprises like Mary Claire's menstrual health program in Cameroon - culturally embedded, serving poor communities, generating real impact - because solutions meeting fundamental needs of the poor don't generate returns: rural livelihoods, basic health, education, clean water. Meanwhile impact investors profit by asking those on the edge of poverty to solve problems caused by profit-maximizing choices of wealthy corporations. After 10 years running Bloom's accelerator programs across 16 countries, we've learned that the entrepreneurs who stayed - the \"embers of the Arab Spring\" - need community infrastructure, not more pressure to scale. We're building the missing middle: a solidarity-based support system where 10-11 social enterprises pool resources, share services, and prove that horizontal scale (many sustainable small successes) can rival vertical scale (one big winner) while actually serving communities.\n\n---\n\n## WHY THESE THREE PROBLEMS WORK TOGETHER\n\n### **Problem 1: The Scale Paradox** (Your Meta-Critique)\n\n**The Research:**\n- Meta-analysis of 600+ papers covering 20 different development interventions: larger studies = smaller effects; government programs < NGO/academic programs\n- Kenyan teacher reform case: NGO contracts significantly raised test scores; identical government contracts = zero impact\n\n**Why It's Sharp:**\n- Directly challenges the dominant paradigm (\"scale or die\")\n- Evidence-based, not ideological\n- Explains WHY Mary Claire can't get funding (not her failure, system's failure)\n\n**Why It Matters to You:**\n- This IS your lived experience\n- Validates your instinct that \"small and beautiful\" isn't nostalgic, it's pragmatic\n- Gives you moral authority: you're following the evidence, not fashion\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2: The Funding Cliff** (Your Specific Pain Point)\n\n**The Research:**\n- Mulago Foundation: \"Few solutions that meet fundamental needs of the poor will get you your money back - scalable rural livelihoods, basic health care, basic education, clean water - with very few exceptions, you don't make money off this stuff\"\n- Small/new social enterprises fail to meet impact investor requirements: can't demonstrate healthy financial track records, realistic projections, strategies to scale\n- Winners Take All: investors profit from app-based solutions (like Even, charging $260/year to smooth income volatility) instead of fixing the labor practices creating the problem\n\n**Why It's Sharp:**\n- Names the hypocrisy: we claim to help the poor but fund solutions that profit from their poverty\n- Connects to Echoing Green's equity mission (they HATE \"winners take all\")\n- Makes your teams the protagonists, investors the obstacle\n\n**Why It Matters to You:**\n- Mary Claire's story is your proof point\n- Your teams are stuck in this exact trap\n- You're proposing the alternative they need\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 3: Cultural Embeddedness = Competitive Advantage** (Your Secret Weapon)\n\n**The Research:**\n- Cultural mismatch between school and home culture adversely affects learning; by age 8, enthusiasm and self-confidence can be significantly negatively affected\n- One-size-fits-all approach fails to accommodate diversity of societal needs; overlooks importance of context-specific education responsive to local environmental, cultural, socio-economic realities\n- Renewable energy cooperatives show diverse scaling strategies: mutual interest orientation can lead to \"scale-out\" and \"scale-deep\" rather than just \"scale-up\"\n\n**Why It's Sharp:**\n- Reframes \"not scalable\" as \"culturally competent\"\n- Echoing Green explicitly wants leaders who \"reflect the community they serve\"\n- This is why proximity matters (their selection criteria emphasizes this)\n\n**Why It Matters to You:**\n- This is your \"soul\" argument in secular language\n- Mary Claire's tampon program works BECAUSE it's culturally negotiated\n- Your teams' embeddedness is the feature, not the bug\n\n---\n\n## YOUR PROPOSAL FRAMED THROUGH THIS LENS\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nThe social impact sector suffers from scale fetishism. Despite research showing that larger interventions produce smaller effects and that solutions serving the poorest communities rarely generate investor returns, we continue pressuring social entrepreneurs to \"scale or die.\" This creates a funding cliff for precisely the kind of culturally-embedded, community-serving enterprises that research shows are most effective. Bloom's 10-11 alumni teams across 16 countries - survivors of the shifting funding landscape since the Arab Spring - are stuck in this gap: too successful for grants, too \"unscalable\" for investment.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe impact investing field has adopted Silicon Valley's growth logic without questioning whether it serves communities. As Giridharadas documents, this creates a system where elites \"change the world\" through market-based solutions that protect the very systems creating the problems. We measure \"impact\" by how many people are reached, not by depth of transformation. We celebrate entrepreneurs who can pitch investors, not those embedded in communities who do the hard cultural negotiation that makes change stick.\n\n**Your Innovation:**\nBuild solidarity economy infrastructure for social enterprises post-accelerator. Instead of trying to make Mary Claire \"scalable,\" create community mechanisms where 10-11 enterprises support each other through:\n1. **Resource pooling** to smooth revenue volatility (agriculture + education seasonal balancing)\n2. **Shared services** to reduce costs (bulk purchasing, shared legal/accounting)\n3. **Peer learning** to solve implementation challenges together\n4. **Alternative metrics** that value depth over breadth, resilience over growth\n5. **Proof of concept** that horizontal federation > vertical scale\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- Cooperatives generate $2.2 trillion globally and employ 10% of world's workforce; they have lower failure rates and greater resilience in downturns\n- Renewable energy cooperatives demonstrate \"scale-deep\" strategies that build community ownership rather than extractive growth\n- You're not inventing this model - you're adapting proven cooperative principles to the social enterprise context\n\n**18-Month Outcomes:**\n1. Activate community of 10-11 teams through full-time community manager\n2. Pilot revenue-sharing/resource-pooling with 5-7 participating teams\n3. Document $X savings through shared services\n4. Publish case studies showing alternative scaling models\n5. Create replicable blueprint for post-accelerator support infrastructure\n6.

This approach illuminates systemic challenges while maintaining a deeply human-centered perspective.\n\nThe big problem in the social impact sector reveals complex interconnected dynamics that demand innovative, holistic solutions.\n\nThe sector's scale-driven mindset fundamentally misunderstands community transformation. By creating funding mechanisms that marginalize culturally embedded enterprises, current approaches perpetuate structural inequities.

            "text": "Looking at your priorities, the research strength, and what will actually work for an 18-month fellowship, here's my sharp recommendation:\n\n## THE WINNING COMBINATION: Scale Paradox + Funding Cliff + Cultural Embeddedness\n\n**Why this trio:**\n1. Strongest research backing (meta-analysis of 600+ studies)\n2. Sharpest critique of current system (directly challenges Winners Take All)\n3. Best match to YOUR lived experience (Mary Claire, your 10-11 teams)\n4. Most actionable for 18 months\n5. Perfectly aligned with EG's equity/systems change mission\n\n---\n\n## YOUR CORE ARGUMENT (One Paragraph Version)\n\nThe social impact sector has imported Silicon Valley's scale-at-all-costs logic, but meta-analysis of 600+ development interventions shows larger studies have smaller effect sizes, and government-scaled programs underperform local implementations. This creates a funding cliff for social enterprises like Mary Claire's menstrual health program in Cameroon - culturally embedded, serving poor communities, generating real impact - because solutions meeting fundamental needs of the poor don't generate returns: rural livelihoods, basic health, education, clean water. Meanwhile impact investors profit by asking those on the edge of poverty to solve problems caused by profit-maximizing choices of wealthy corporations. After 10 years running Bloom's accelerator programs across 16 countries, we've learned that the entrepreneurs who stayed - the \"embers of the Arab Spring\" - need community infrastructure, not more pressure to scale. We're building the missing middle: a solidarity-based support system where 10-11 social enterprises pool resources, share services, and prove that horizontal scale (many sustainable small successes) can rival vertical scale (one big winner) while actually serving communities.\n\n---\n\n## WHY THESE THREE PROBLEMS WORK TOGETHER\n\n### **Problem 1: The Scale Paradox** (Your Meta-Critique)\n\n**The Research:**\n- Meta-analysis of 600+ papers covering 20 different development interventions: larger studies = smaller effects; government programs < NGO/academic programs\n- Kenyan teacher reform case: NGO contracts significantly raised test scores; identical government contracts = zero impact\n\n**Why It's Sharp:**\n- Directly challenges the dominant paradigm (\"scale or die\")\n- Evidence-based, not ideological\n- Explains WHY Mary Claire can't get funding (not her failure, system's failure)\n\n**Why It Matters to You:**\n- This IS your lived experience\n- Validates your instinct that \"small and beautiful\" isn't nostalgic, it's pragmatic\n- Gives you moral authority: you're following the evidence, not fashion\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 2: The Funding Cliff** (Your Specific Pain Point)\n\n**The Research:**\n- Mulago Foundation: \"Few solutions that meet fundamental needs of the poor will get you your money back - scalable rural livelihoods, basic health care, basic education, clean water - with very few exceptions, you don't make money off this stuff\"\n- Small/new social enterprises fail to meet impact investor requirements: can't demonstrate healthy financial track records, realistic projections, strategies to scale\n- Winners Take All: investors profit from app-based solutions (like Even, charging $260/year to smooth income volatility) instead of fixing the labor practices creating the problem\n\n**Why It's Sharp:**\n- Names the hypocrisy: we claim to help the poor but fund solutions that profit from their poverty\n- Connects to Echoing Green's equity mission (they HATE \"winners take all\")\n- Makes your teams the protagonists, investors the obstacle\n\n**Why It Matters to You:**\n- Mary Claire's story is your proof point\n- Your teams are stuck in this exact trap\n- You're proposing the alternative they need\n\n---\n\n### **Problem 3: Cultural Embeddedness = Competitive Advantage** (Your Secret Weapon)\n\n**The Research:**\n- Cultural mismatch between school and home culture adversely affects learning; by age 8, enthusiasm and self-confidence can be significantly negatively affected\n- One-size-fits-all approach fails to accommodate diversity of societal needs; overlooks importance of context-specific education responsive to local environmental, cultural, socio-economic realities\n- Renewable energy cooperatives show diverse scaling strategies: mutual interest orientation can lead to \"scale-out\" and \"scale-deep\" rather than just \"scale-up\"\n\n**Why It's Sharp:**\n- Reframes \"not scalable\" as \"culturally competent\"\n- Echoing Green explicitly wants leaders who \"reflect the community they serve\"\n- This is why proximity matters (their selection criteria emphasizes this)\n\n**Why It Matters to You:**\n- This is your \"soul\" argument in secular language\n- Mary Claire's tampon program works BECAUSE it's culturally negotiated\n- Your teams' embeddedness is the feature, not the bug\n\n---\n\n## YOUR PROPOSAL FRAMED THROUGH THIS LENS\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nThe social impact sector suffers from scale fetishism. Despite research showing that larger interventions produce smaller effects and that solutions serving the poorest communities rarely generate investor returns, we continue pressuring social entrepreneurs to \"scale or die.\" This creates a funding cliff for precisely the kind of culturally-embedded, community-serving enterprises that research shows are most effective. Bloom's 10-11 alumni teams across 16 countries - survivors of the shifting funding landscape since the Arab Spring - are stuck in this gap: too successful for grants, too \"unscalable\" for investment.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe impact investing field has adopted Silicon Valley's growth logic without questioning whether it serves communities. As Giridharadas documents, this creates a system where elites \"change the world\" through market-based solutions that protect the very systems creating the problems. We measure \"impact\" by how many people are reached, not by depth of transformation. We celebrate entrepreneurs who can pitch investors, not those embedded in communities who do the hard cultural negotiation that makes change stick.\n\n**Your Innovation:**\nBuild solidarity economy infrastructure for social enterprises post-accelerator. Instead of trying to make Mary Claire \"scalable,\" create community mechanisms where 10-11 enterprises support each other through:\n1. **Resource pooling** to smooth revenue volatility (agriculture + education seasonal balancing)\n2. **Shared services** to reduce costs (bulk purchasing, shared legal/accounting)\n3. **Peer learning** to solve implementation challenges together\n4. **Alternative metrics** that value depth over breadth, resilience over growth\n5. **Proof of concept** that horizontal federation > vertical scale\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- Cooperatives generate $2.2 trillion globally and employ 10% of world's workforce; they have lower failure rates and greater resilience in downturns\n- Renewable energy cooperatives demonstrate \"scale-deep\" strategies that build community ownership rather than extractive growth\n- You're not inventing this model - you're adapting proven cooperative principles to the social enterprise context\n\n**18-Month Outcomes:**\n1. Activate community of 10-11 teams through full-time community manager\n2. Pilot revenue-sharing/resource-pooling with 5-7 participating teams\n3. Document $X savings through shared services\n4. Publish case studies showing alternative scaling models\n5. Create replicable blueprint for post-accelerator support infrastructure\n6. Demonstrate that your model keeps teams sustainable while maintaining community embeddedness\n\n**Systems Change:**\nYou're challenging the \"winners take all\" paradigm by building the alternative. If it works, you prove that solidarity economy principles can support social enterprises at scale (horizontally, not vertically). You shift the conversation from \"how do we make these ventures investable?\" to \"how do we build community infrastructure that makes traditional investment unnecessary?\"\n\n---\n\n## WHAT TO DROP FROM YOUR PROPOSAL\n\n**Don't lead with:**\n1. ❌ The \"soul\" language (save for your personal why, not the pitch)\n2. ❌ SDG framing (too bureaucratic, not your authentic voice)\n3. ❌ Khan Academy critiques (not your domain, distracts from your work)\n4. ❌ Too much philosophy about \"learning orchestra\" (beautiful but unfocused for a grant)\n5. ❌ The cursive app idea (sounds like product development, not community building)\n\n**Do lead with:**\n1. ✅ Mary Claire's story (specific, emotional, proves the problem)\n2. ✅ Your 10 years / Arab Spring context (shows proximity and commitment)  \n3. ✅ Scale paradox research (evidence-based authority)\n4. ✅ Solidarity economy as solution (innovative, replicable)\n5. ✅ Concrete 18-month plan (achievable, measurable)\n\n---\n\n## THE SHARPEST VERSION OF YOUR PITCH\n\n\"For 10 years, Bloom has run accelerator programs for social entrepreneurs across 16 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond.

It's too negative, too abstract, too \"complaining.\"\n\nThe user wants to focus on:\n- What we're FOR (solidarity, community, embeddedness)\n- Not what we're AGAINST (scale, investors, etc.)\n\nThis is actually sharper. The scale paradox feels like you're trying to convince people scaling is bad. But the user doesn't need to prove that - they just need to prove that their alternative works.You're absolutely right. The scale critique feels like complaining from the sidelines rather than building something real. Let me reframe:\n\n---\n\n## THE ACTUAL WINNING COMBINATION: Funding Cliff + Cultural Embeddedness + Solidarity as Alternative\n\n**Why this is sharper:**\n- Funding cliff = explains the concrete problem (why Mary Claire can't get funded)\n- Cultural embeddedness = explains why proximity is the solution, not the obstacle\n- Solidarity infrastructure = what you're actually building (positive, generative)\n\nYou're not critiquing scale - you're just building a different path that values relationship and community.\n\n---\n\n## YOUR CORE ARGUMENT (Revised)\n\nAfter 10 years running Bloom accelerators across 16 countries, we've watched entrepreneurs like Mary Claire get stuck. Her menstrual health program serves girls in 8 Cameroonian schools through culturally-negotiated workshops and tampon dispensers - real impact, sustainable model. She brought Dubai investors to tears. Zero funding. Not because she's failing, but because solutions meeting fundamental needs of poor communities don't generate investor returns - rural livelihoods, basic health, education, clean water. Her thin margins and cultural specificity - the very things that make her program work - make her \"uninvestable.\" \n\nMeanwhile, our 10-11 surviving teams from across the Middle East and North Africa are isolated, struggling, doing important work without infrastructure. They need what every community needs: mutual support, shared resources, people who understand their context. We're building solidarity economy infrastructure for social enterprises - resource pooling, shared services, peer learning - to prove that community strength can replace dependence on external funding. We don't know exactly what this looks like yet, but we're figuring it out together with the people who've stayed in this work. This could be a new avenue for how impact organizations actually work WITH their communities, not just FOR them.\n\n---\n\n## THE TWO-PART CASE\n\n### **Part 1: THE FUNDING CLIFF (The Problem)**\n\n**The Reality:**\n- Mulago Foundation, after decades of work: \"Few solutions that meet fundamental needs of the poor will get you your money back - scalable rural livelihoods, basic health care, basic education, clean water\"\n- Small social enterprises can't demonstrate the financial track records, growth projections, and scale strategies that investors require\n\n**Mary Claire's Story:**\nShe's not the exception - she's the rule. Culturally appropriate, community-embedded work serving poor populations will always have thin margins. That's not a bug, it's how it works. Tampons for school girls in Cameroon should be affordable. Which means Mary Claire will never have investor-friendly returns.\n\n**The Gap:**\nAccelerators train people, connect them to investors, then disappear. But for entrepreneurs serving poor communities, there IS no investor funding. So you've trained them, raised their expectations, helped them build something real... then abandoned them. That's where your 10-11 teams are stuck.\n\n**Why This Works for Your Pitch:**\n- Concrete, not abstract\n- Explains the actual mechanism (returns vs. mission)\n- Makes Mary Claire the protagonist, not a victim\n- Shows you understand the structural problem\n- Sets up your solution as filling the gap, not fighting the system\n\n---\n\n### **Part 2: CULTURAL EMBEDDEDNESS AS STRENGTH (The Reframe)**\n\n**The Case:**\nWhat investors call \"not scalable,\" communities call \"actually understands us.\"\n\n**The Research:**\n- When learning environments differ from home culture, learning is adversely affected; by age 8, cultural mismatch can significantly damage enthusiasm and self-confidence\n- One-size-fits-all approaches fail to accommodate diversity of societal needs and overlook context-specific solutions responsive to local realities\n\n**What This Means:**\nMary Claire's program works BECAUSE she spent time understanding cultural taboos around menstruation, BECAUSE she negotiated with school administrators in ways that fit their context, BECAUSE she designed workshops that girls actually wanted to attend. The cultural specificity isn't a limitation - it's why the program succeeds.\n\n**Echoing Green's Language:**\nThey explicitly want \"leaders who reflect the community they serve and bring deep knowledge of the issues into their work.\" That's Mary Claire. That's all your teams. Their proximity is their qualification.\n\n**The Pivot:**\nSo the question isn't \"how do we make these enterprises scalable?\" It's \"how do we support enterprises that are doing exactly what they should be doing - serving their communities well?\"\n\n---\n\n## YOUR PROPOSAL: BUILDING SOLIDARITY INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n**What You're Actually Doing:**\n\nYou're creating the support system that should exist after accelerators. Not training, not investor connections - community infrastructure.\n\n**The Honest Framing:**\n\"We don't know exactly what this looks like yet. We have ideas - revenue pooling to smooth seasonal income, bulk purchasing to reduce costs, peer problem-solving - but we're figuring it out WITH our teams, not FOR them. That's the point. We're building community infrastructure the way communities do: together, iteratively, based on actual needs.\"\n\n**The Three Mechanisms:**\n\n1. **Resource Sharing**\n   - Teams with seasonal revenue (agriculture) pool with teams with stable revenue (schools)\n   - Bulk purchasing for services all teams need (accounting, legal, web hosting)\n   - Not charity, not investment - mutual aid\n\n2. **Knowledge Exchange**\n   - Your Lebanese team building AI for people with disabilities mentors others on tech\n   - Mary Claire teaches community engagement to teams struggling with uptake\n   - You're the hub facilitating these connections\n\n3. **Alternative Infrastructure**\n   - Creating what cooperatives have always done: shared ownership, democratic governance, resilience through collective strength\n   - Building proof that community infrastructure can replace dependence on external funding\n   - Demonstrating a model other impact organizations could adopt\n\n**Why This Is Sharp:**\n- You're not opposing anything - you're just building\n- You're honest about not having all answers\n- You're centering community and relationship\n- You're drawing on proven cooperative principles\n- You're creating something replicable\n\n---\n\n## THE ALTERNATIVE FRAMING FOR INGOS\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n\"This could change how impact organizations relate to their 'alumni' or 'beneficiaries.' What if instead of programs with endpoints, we built ongoing communities? What if the goal wasn't to make every venture investable, but to create peer networks strong enough that they don't need outside investment?\n\nMost INGOs run programs, collect impact metrics, then move to the next cohort. We're asking: what if we stayed? What if we helped people build community infrastructure that outlasts any single program? We think there's a model here that could transform how the development sector works - not extracting stories for donor reports, but actually being in solidarity.\"\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- It's generative, not critical\n- It positions you as pioneers, not critics  \n- It suggests your model could spread\n- It appeals to EG's \"systems change\" mandate\n- It's humble (we're learning, not lecturing)\n\n---\n\n## YOUR REVISED PITCH\n\n\"After 10 years running Bloom's accelerator programs across 16 countries, we've learned that the biggest gap in the social impact ecosystem isn't training or connections - it's community infrastructure. Entrepreneurs like Mary Claire, whose menstrual health program serves girls in 8 Cameroonian schools, can't access investor funding because solutions serving poor communities rarely generate returns. Her thin margins and cultural specificity - the very things that make her work effective - make her 'uninvestable.'\n\nOur 10-11 surviving teams from the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond face the same reality. They're doing important, embedded, culturally-appropriate work. They're isolated, under-resourced, and falling through the gap between grant funding and investment capital. They don't need more training - they need community.\n\nWe're building solidarity economy infrastructure: resource pooling to smooth revenue, shared services to reduce costs, peer learning to solve implementation challenges together. We're drawing on cooperative principles that have sustained communities for centuries - cooperatives globally generate $2.2 trillion and employ 10% of the world's workforce - and adapting them to the social enterprise context.\n\nWe don't have all the answers. We're figuring this out together with the people who've stayed in this work. But we think this could offer a new model for how impact organizations actually work WITH communities in ongoing relationship, rather than running time-bound programs and moving on.\n\nOver 18 months, we'll activate this community, pilot mutual aid mechanisms, and document what emerges. We're not trying to replace the investor pipeline - we're building the alternative for everyone it doesn't serve.\"\n\n---\n\nDoes this feel more like building something real rather than complaining about something broken? Want me to help structure the actual application sections with this framing?",

Agricultural enterprises have seasonal revenue; schools have stable income. Can they balance each other?

Reduce individual costs through collective bargaining.\n\n**Peer Learning**: Our Lebanese team building AI can mentor others on technology. Teams strong in community engagement can share what works. We're the hub connecting expertise.\n\n**Documentation**: Capture what emerges - failures and successes - to create a replicable model for post-accelerator support based on solidarity rather than scale.\n\nThis is experimental.

Over 18 months, activate relationships between teams who can support each other.\n\n**Material Solidarity Mechanisms**: Pilot resource pooling with willing teams. Agricultural enterprises have seasonal revenue; schools have stable income. Can they balance each other? We'll test revenue-sharing, mutual credit systems, or other models teams want to try.\n\n**Shared Services**: Negotiate bulk rates for services all teams need - accounting, legal, web hosting, insurance. Reduce individual costs through collective bargaining.\n\n**Peer Learning**: Our Lebanese team building AI can mentor others on technology. Teams strong in community engagement can share what works. We're the hub connecting expertise.\n\n**Documentation**: Capture what emerges - failures and successes - to create a replicable model for post-accelerator support based on solidarity rather than scale.\n\nThis is experimental. We're learning what works by doing it together.\n\n---\n\n**Character count: 1,197**\n\nToo long - want me to cut?",

What specific solidarity structures came up in those 22 team discussions?\n2. What's working/what's the energy around from the co-creation calls?\n3. What are the practical next steps they can commit to in 18 months?Good catch - let me look at what EG actually says for this section.\n\n**From the criteria document:**\n- \"Describe the approach you will take\" - they want your STRATEGY\n- \"Specific activities involved\" - concrete, actionable things\n- They score on \"concrete answers that illustrate\" - so examples matter\n- Under \"Innovation\" they want you to show \"how your idea improves on or differs from existing approaches\"\n\nThe user is saying you've already done groundwork (22 teams, co-creation calls started) - that's GOLD. Shows you're not just proposing, you're building on real momentum.\n\n---\n\n## 3 QUESTIONS TO GET DEEPER CONTENT:\n\n**1. WHAT ARE YOU ALREADY LEARNING?**\nYou've talked to 22 teams and started co-creation calls. What's emerging? Are there 2-3 specific solidarity structures they're excited about? Any surprising ideas that came from THEM rather than you? (This shows you're listening, not imposing)\n\n**2. WHAT'S THE 18-MONTH ROADMAP?**\nIf you get this fellowship, what are the milestones? Month 3: X teams commit to pilot. Month 9: First resource-sharing happens. Month 18: We've proven Y. (EG wants to see you can execute, not just ideate)\n\n**3. WHO ARE THE 5-7 TEAMS IN THE PILOT?**\nWhich teams are ready to go? What do they bring to the table (stable revenue, seasonal income, specific expertise)? Naming real teams with real assets makes this concrete instead of conceptual. Can you say \"Team A in Lebanon has steady school income, Team B in Cameroon has harvest-season peaks - they're piloting revenue smoothing\"?\n\n---\n\nThese answers will help me write something that shows: you've done the work, there's real demand, and you have a concrete plan.",

            "text": "Good catch - let me look at what EG actually says for this section.\n\n**From the criteria document:**\n- \"Describe the approach you will take\" - they want your STRATEGY\n- \"Specific activities involved\" - concrete, actionable things\n- They score on \"concrete answers that illustrate\" - so examples matter\n- Under \"Innovation\" they want you to show \"how your idea improves on or differs from existing approaches\"\n\nThe user is saying you've already done groundwork (22 teams, co-creation calls started) - that's GOLD. Shows you're not just proposing, you're building on real momentum.\n\n---\n\n## 3 QUESTIONS TO GET DEEPER CONTENT:\n\n**1. WHAT ARE YOU ALREADY LEARNING?**\nYou've talked to 22 teams and started co-creation calls. What's emerging? Are there 2-3 specific solidarity structures they're excited about? Any surprising ideas that came from THEM rather than you? (This shows you're listening, not imposing)\n\n**2. WHAT'S THE 18-MONTH ROADMAP?**\nIf you get this fellowship, what are the milestones? Month 3: X teams commit to pilot. Month 9: First resource-sharing happens. Month 18: We've proven Y. (EG wants to see you can execute, not just ideate)\n\n**3. WHO ARE THE 5-7 TEAMS IN THE PILOT?**\nWhich teams are ready to go? What do they bring to the table (stable revenue, seasonal income, specific expertise)? Naming real teams with real assets makes this concrete instead of conceptual. Can you say \"Team A in Lebanon has steady school income, Team B in Cameroon has harvest-season peaks - they're piloting revenue smoothing\"?\n\n---\n\nThese answers will help me write something that shows: you've done the work, there's real demand, and you have a concrete plan.",

Set simple rules (e.g., contribute 5%, withdraw up to 5%). Bloom facilitates, with elected team reps guiding decisions. 2. **Liquidity (Months 6–12):** Seed pool with fellowship funds to ensure early stability. First withdrawals and repayments happen. Test transparency tools (dashboards, reporting). 3. **Scale (Months 12–18):** Grow participation beyond pilot. Explore partnerships (sales pipeline, shared services). Begin governance transition to cooperative model. 4. **Storytelling:** Document results, share case studies, build proof-of-concept that solidarity funding works post-accelerator. **Innovation:** Instead of pushing every team to scale for investors, we’re proving a cooperative model where entrepreneurs support each other financially, rooted in their communities. 👉 If you handed this to EG, it’s easy to read, shows strategy *and* concrete activities, and positions you as practical, not abstract.

      "content": "The user is asking about how to structure an investment vehicle that:\n1. De-risks investment by pooling revenue-generating teams\n2. Benefits both investors and the teams\n3. Addresses the problem that funds don't come because teams are risky/have small margins\n\nThey want 3 ways this could work. They're also not sure how investment mechanics work.\n\nI need to be honest here: they're venturing into complex financial instrument design (cooperative investment vehicles, revenue pooling, investor returns) without clear understanding of the mechanics. This is getting complicated for an EG application that has ~950 character limit.\n\nI should:\n1. Give them 3 possible models\n2. But also be honest about the complexity and risk\n3. Point out that for an 18-month EG fellowship, they might want to start simpler\n4. Help them think about what's actually achievable vs. what's aspirational\n\nLet me think about 3 models:\n\nModel 1: Revenue-based financing pool\n- Teams contribute % of revenue to pool\n- Investors lend to pool at fixed return (like 5-10%)\n- Pool distributes to teams in lean months\n- Teams benefit: stable income\n- Investors benefit: fixed return on lower-risk pooled asset\n- Problem: Still needs repayment to investors\n\nModel 2: Profit-sharing cooperative with investor tier\n- Teams pool profits (not revenue)\n- Investors buy \"shares\" that get dividends when pool is profitable\n- Time-limited investor participation (like 5 years max)\n- Teams benefit: liquidity now, investor exit later\n- Investors benefit: dividends while invested, exit with return\n- Problem: Complex governance, profit calculation hard\n\nModel 3: Katalyst/recoverable grant model\n- Investors put money into pool as \"recoverable grants\"\n- Teams only repay if they hit certain thresholds (like EG's own model for for-profits)\n- Pool grows from successful teams, supports struggling ones\n- Teams benefit: downside protection\n\n\n- Investors benefit: some social return, some financial return\n- Problem: Still needs investors willing to accept this model\n\nThe proposed models reveal significant complexity. While innovative, they require sophisticated legal and financial infrastructure beyond an 18-month fellowship. I recommend focusing first on the mutual aid core, positioning investor mechanisms as future potential. The key is starting simple: create a basic collaborative framework that teams can trust and gradually develop more advanced financial structures.Let me be direct: you're mixing two very different things, and it's making this muddy.\n\n**Problem 1:** You're trying to design a complex financial instrument (cooperative + investor layer + revenue pooling + profit sharing) without understanding the mechanics. This requires legal structure, regulatory compliance, financial modeling - that's not an 18-month fellowship project, that's a multi-year fintech build.\n\n**Problem 2:** For EG, you need ONE clear innovation you can execute in 18 months. Right now you're proposing: mutual aid fund + investor vehicle + sales pipeline + Bloom as cooperative member. That's 4 different things.\n\n---\n\n## HERE ARE 3 WAYS INVESTOR LAYER COULD WORK:\n\n**Model 1: Revenue-Based Financing Pool**\n- 10 teams contribute 5% of monthly revenue to pool\n- Pool lends money to teams in lean months (interest-free or low interest)\n- Investors lend to the POOL at fixed return (say 8%)\n- **Teams benefit:** Stable income, borrow from themselves essentially\n- **Investors benefit:** Fixed return on diversified portfolio (less risky than single team)\n- **Problem:** Teams still have to generate enough to repay pool + investor returns\n\n**Model 2: Profit-Sharing Cooperative with Time-Limited Investors**\n- Teams pool a % of profits (not revenue - key difference)\n- Investors buy temporary \"shares\" that receive dividends when pool is net positive\n- After 5 years, investors exit and shares revert to teams\n- **Teams benefit:** Get liquidity now, full ownership later\n- **Investors benefit:** Dividends while invested, eventual buyback\n- **Problem:** Requires profit (not just revenue), complex legal structure, governance nightmares\n\n**Model 3: Recoverable Grant Model (Like EG's Own System)**\n- Investors put money into pool as \"recoverable grants\" \n- Teams only repay if they hit thresholds (e.g., $100k annual revenue + profitable)\n- Successful teams repay into pool, which supports struggling teams\n- **Teams benefit:** Downside protection, only pay if they can afford it\n- **Investors benefit:** Social impact + some financial return from successful teams\n- **Problem:** You need impact investors who accept below-market returns\n\n---\n\n## MY HONEST ASSESSMENT:\n\nAll three models require:\n- Legal entity formation (cooperative structure)\n- Financial modeling and projections  \n- Regulatory compliance (depending on country)\n- Investor relations and fundraising\n- Complex governance (who decides what)\n\n**This is WAY beyond what you can pilot in 18 months with a $100k fellowship.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY PROPOSE:\n\n**Keep it simple for EG:** Pilot the mutual aid fund with 5-10 teams. Period. No investor layer yet.\n\n**Why this works:**\n1. You can actually do it in 18 months\n2. It proves the concept that pooling works\n3. It generates data on revenue patterns, trust, governance\n4. THEN you can say \"investors could join later\" as future vision\n\n**Frame it like this:**\n\"We're piloting a solidarity revenue pool with 5-10 teams. PsyAI (Jordan) and Coursaty (Lebanon) both hit $10k revenue months but at different times - psychology peaks off-season, education during school year. They pool 5% of revenue in fat months, draw from pool in lean months. Bloom participates as equal member. \n\nIf this works, it creates a de-risked investment opportunity: a pool of revenue-generating teams with diversified income streams and track records. But first we need to prove teams will actually do this, build trust, and establish governance. That's the 18-month work.\"\n\n**Then add ONE sentence:** \"This pilot could eventually attract impact investors seeking lower-risk, community-embedded opportunities, but we're starting with mutual aid first.\"\n\n---\n\nDoes this help you see why you need to narrow the scope? You're trying to solve too many problems at once. Pick ONE: the mutual aid pool. If it works, the investor layer becomes easier to design because you have proof of concept and actual data.\n\nWant me to write the approach section with this simplified scope?",

Help them think about what's actually achievable vs. what's aspirational\n\nLet me think about 3 models:\n\nModel 1: Revenue-based financing pool\n- Teams contribute % of revenue to pool\n- Investors lend to pool at fixed return (like 5-10%)\n- Pool distributes to teams in lean months\n- Teams benefit: stable income\n- Investors benefit: fixed return on lower-risk pooled asset\n- Problem: Still needs repayment to investors\n\nModel 2: Profit-sharing cooperative with investor tier\n- Teams pool profits (not revenue)\n- Investors buy \"shares\" that get dividends when pool is profitable\n- Time-limited investor participation (like 5 years max)\n- Teams benefit: liquidity now, investor exit later\n- Investors benefit: dividends while invested, exit with return\n- Problem: Complex governance, profit calculation hard\n\nModel 3: Katalyst/recoverable grant model\n- Investors put money into pool as \"recoverable grants\"\n- Teams only repay if they hit certain thresholds (like EG's own model for for-profits)\n- Pool grows from successful teams, supports struggling ones\n- Teams benefit: downside protection\n\n\n- Investors benefit: some social return, some financial return\n- Problem: Still needs investors willing to accept this model\n\nThe proposed models reveal significant complexity. While innovative, they require sophisticated legal and financial infrastructure beyond an 18-month fellowship. I recommend focusing first on the mutual aid core, positioning investor mechanisms as future potential. The key is starting simple: create a basic collaborative framework that teams can trust and gradually develop more advanced financial structures.",

            "text": "Let me be direct: you're mixing two very different things, and it's making this muddy.\n\n**Problem 1:** You're trying to design a complex financial instrument (cooperative + investor layer + revenue pooling + profit sharing) without understanding the mechanics. This requires legal structure, regulatory compliance, financial modeling - that's not an 18-month fellowship project, that's a multi-year fintech build.\n\n**Problem 2:** For EG, you need ONE clear innovation you can execute in 18 months. Right now you're proposing: mutual aid fund + investor vehicle + sales pipeline + Bloom as cooperative member. That's 4 different things.\n\n---\n\n## HERE ARE 3 WAYS INVESTOR LAYER COULD WORK:\n\n**Model 1: Revenue-Based Financing Pool**\n- 10 teams contribute 5% of monthly revenue to pool\n- Pool lends money to teams in lean months (interest-free or low interest)\n- Investors lend to the POOL at fixed return (say 8%)\n- **Teams benefit:** Stable income, borrow from themselves essentially\n- **Investors benefit:** Fixed return on diversified portfolio (less risky than single team)\n- **Problem:** Teams still have to generate enough to repay pool + investor returns\n\n**Model 2: Profit-Sharing Cooperative with Time-Limited Investors**\n- Teams pool a % of profits (not revenue - key difference)\n- Investors buy temporary \"shares\" that receive dividends when pool is net positive\n- After 5 years, investors exit and shares revert to teams\n- **Teams benefit:** Get liquidity now, full ownership later\n- **Investors benefit:** Dividends while invested, eventual buyback\n- **Problem:** Requires profit (not just revenue), complex legal structure, governance nightmares\n\n**Model 3: Recoverable Grant Model (Like EG's Own System)**\n- Investors put money into pool as \"recoverable grants\" \n- Teams only repay if they hit thresholds (e.g., $100k annual revenue + profitable)\n- Successful teams repay into pool, which supports struggling teams\n- **Teams benefit:** Downside protection, only pay if they can afford it\n- **Investors benefit:** Social impact + some financial return from successful teams\n- **Problem:** You need impact investors who accept below-market returns\n\n---\n\n## MY HONEST ASSESSMENT:\n\nAll three models require:\n- Legal entity formation (cooperative structure)\n- Financial modeling and projections  \n- Regulatory compliance (depending on country)\n- Investor relations and fundraising\n- Complex governance (who decides what)\n\n**This is WAY beyond what you can pilot in 18 months with a $100k fellowship.**\n\n---\n\n## WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY PROPOSE:\n\n**Keep it simple for EG:** Pilot the mutual aid fund with 5-10 teams. Period. No investor layer yet.\n\n**Why this works:**\n1. You can actually do it in 18 months\n2. It proves the concept that pooling works\n3. It generates data on revenue patterns, trust, governance\n4. THEN you can say \"investors could join later\" as future vision\n\n**Frame it like this:**\n\"We're piloting a solidarity revenue pool with 5-10 teams. PsyAI (Jordan) and Coursaty (Lebanon) both hit $10k revenue months but at different times - psychology peaks off-season, education during school year. They pool 5% of revenue in fat months, draw from pool in lean months. Bloom participates as equal member. \n\nIf this works, it creates a de-risked investment opportunity: a pool of revenue-generating teams with diversified income streams and track records. But first we need to prove teams will actually do this, build trust, and establish governance. That's the 18-month work.\"\n\n**Then add ONE sentence:** \"This pilot could eventually attract impact investors seeking lower-risk, community-embedded opportunities, but we're starting with mutual aid first.\"\n\n---\n\nDoes this help you see why you need to narrow the scope? You're trying to solve too many problems at once. Pick ONE: the mutual aid pool. If it works, the investor layer becomes easier to design because you have proof of concept and actual data.\n\nWant me to write the approach section with this simplified scope?",
