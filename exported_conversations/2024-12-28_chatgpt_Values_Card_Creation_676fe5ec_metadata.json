  "notes": "MAJOR DISCOVERY: First EXPLICIT citation of Joe Edelman's work - full academic paper included. Shows depth of engagement: not casual influence, but RIGOROUS study of welfare economics, social choice theory, philosophy of values. BRIDGE BUILDING: Taking dense academic theory and reverse-engineering it into conversational AI system prompt. META-RECURSION: Designing AI to help others discover values WHILE discovering own values WHILE critiquing economic assumptions about values. JOE EDELMAN RELATIONSHIP: Either collaborator (meaning.supplies 'our database') or deep student implementing frameworks. PHILOSOPHICAL DEPTH: Engaging with Rawls, Sen, Anderson, Arrow, Velleman - serious philosophical chops. CRITIQUE OF ECONOMICS: Revealed preference doesn't work - people make choices under coercion/desperation that don't reflect values. Need filter for 'meaningful choice'. PRACTICAL IMPLICATION: Tool should distinguish CAPs (intrinsic values) from IAPs (external pressure). TIMING PATTERN: Late night (midnight) after design work (morning Streamlined Tool) - theory FOLLOWS design iteration. BARAKANOMICS CONNECTION: Same critique - economics misses what's meaningful, need values-based alternative."
