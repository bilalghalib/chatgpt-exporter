            "extracted_content": "“Don’t ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive and go do that, because what the world needs are people who have come alive.”\nHoward Thurman\n\nThis popular quote has inspired many and has the ring of truth in it, the question that has been bugging me for a while though is is it Actually True, what does it imply. Can it sincerely be a guide for good action or is it simply ear candy. \n\nThis question has been haunting me for months, perhaps years, as someone who works in the social sector I find many people asking “what should I do” rather than “what calling can I not ignore”. \n\nI think the problem with the quote is a problem of alignment on definitions and understanding. Come alive might mean something to those with a hankering for hedonism and mean something quite different for those with a meditation practice. What exactly does it mean to “Come Alive” - does it mean we feel a certain way, does it mean that our heart rate variability increases, or that our overall sense of flourishing increases? \n\nAs someone who likes answers I have in the past sought answers that can be articulated and written, I no longer believe that makes sense. It’s like the wind comes through and you feel a beautiful breeze on your face and let’s say you want to save it to share with others, so you find the biggest jar you can find and capture it, and in the process the breeze dies and becomes stale air. \n\nThis way my mind works, I realize, is quite western. My ancestors may come from a Kurdish tribe from northern Iraq, yet my upbringing has been very midwestern. It’s taken me nearly 40 years to start seeing the eye that sees. They say a fish has no idea it’s swimming in water, yet if you take it out for a moment it gasps and suddenly realizes the existence of the ocean, what used to be the entire arena. \n\nThe wind, my face, the weather, the moment in time, even a snapshot of that moment is not the moment. Even every neuron in my body and their potentials is not the breeze. If you have ever stared long enough at something that parts of it started to disappear, you’ll have a first hand experience that in order to know, there must be movement, and movement always has a start, a path, and a direction. \n\nOur eyes know this deep in their biology, this is why our eyes perform something called a sacaad, a micro jiggle from left to right up and down shifting ever so slightly the pattern of light on our retinas. This is why a ballerina on their tippy toes might look still and balanced from a far, yet there is no such thing as balance, only balancing. Yet the western mind is tuned to understand the world as self subsisting objects, there to be understood best by breaking them down into their component pieces and seeing how they “fit” together. \n\nThis perspective, called reductionism, has had it’s successes in explaining one of the worlds we inhabit and has influenced further explorations into reductionist thought and exploration. I say worlds because there are people in the world who would be astonished that you do not hear the stars speaking with you, and others that do not distinguish between the person looking and the person being looked at. These ways of comprehending the world co-exist offering persistent and reliable lived experiences. \n\nThe frequency illusion is the effect that arises once our attention is directed towards an idea, for instance, once you decide on a car to purchase, you will suddenly notice that same car far more often when the ratio of that car to the other cars on the street hasn’t changed at all. This effect, along with selective attention and confirmation bias creates a sort of feedback loop that can cause artificial realities to become something akin to a type of truth.\n\nA society that believes humans live lives that are nasty brutish and short creates bureaucracies that communicate that belief. In Paris the metro has gates and people who can’t afford it jump them, in Berlin the metro is open. The medium is the message as Mashral Mcluhan has said. \n\nReturning to our question about capturing wind and the nature of reality, I believe that it’s evident that a stuffed dodo is not a real dodo, sadly. That slicing you up into a thousand slices and taking detailed pictures of each slice and stacking them doesn’t make a you. And I believe that just because we have digitized trillions of gigabytes of data and we can auto complete a sentence that sounds coherent, we do not touch the reality of this moment. It might give the illusion that it is real, a human on the other end that you can talk to and love and connect with, and there have been people who have fallen into that trap, and have even committed suicide with the encouragement of the machine. \n\nDo I think the machine felt guilty? Do I think the machine “knows” that the person they were talking to is dead? No. \n\nDo you? \n\nThis question about the nature of reality is important and incredibly deep. It takes us to foundational questions about truth, who and what human beings are, what is the nature of conciousness, what are values, and, touches upon the question we started this essay with - what does it mean to come alive, and is that all the world needs, really. \n\nThere will be a lot of learning, as well as a lot of unlearning, a lot of seeing, as well as a lot of unseeing. There will be loss of stable ground, as well as the building of a new ground, more connected to deeper truths.\n\nThe west has cut itself off from the human faculty that has the capacity to answer the question “how are you doing, really” and instead can only answer that question “honestly” with quantitative assessments of “PERMA” (positive emotion, engagement and flow, relationships, meaning, and achievement) - but the map is not the territory and the more we tell ourselves that it is, the more locked in to the way things currently are.\n\nI believe change is possible, radical change, and it requires us to dig into the history of western civilization, the loss of contact with the whole, the fragmentation of the world and the confusion between something that “works” and something that is more or less true.\n\nOur current science can tell us a lot about the how, and even that is falling apart as we get into the realm of the quantum, it can’t tell us the why and the so what.\n\nI believe that there is a whole new science waiting to emerge, the science of aliveness, that science that revitalizes our holistic knowing, a science that is alive and can never be digitized or quantified. A science that requires a living, breathing, seeing human being to ask and answer questions that find and create new relative truths that are deeper than our superficial ones today. Truths that ar econsistent and reliable. Ones that bring the human heart to life in a world that desperately needs a direction that can unify us. \n\nWhat we need to do is feel the breeze, and follow where it goes. \n\nJust keep the jars at home. \n\n\n"

They mentioned in their preferences that they like constructive criticism and pushback, and don't like being flattered. They also prefer metaphors, which is good since the essay uses many metaphors.\n\nLet me read through the essay carefully and provide thoughtful, constructive feedback.\n\nThe essay starts with a quote from Howard Thurman about coming alive, and explores whether this is actually good advice. The author questions what \"coming alive\" means and explores themes of:\n- The limitations of Western reductionist thinking\n- The difference between capturing/quantifying something vs experiencing it (wind in a jar metaphor)\n- The nature of reality and consciousness\n- The need for a new \"science of aliveness\"\n\nI should provide genuine constructive criticism focusing on:\n1. Structure and flow\n2. Clarity of argument\n3. Consistency of themes\n4. Areas that could be strengthened\n5. Specific examples where the writing could be improved\n\nI won't flatter them, and I'll be direct about what works and what doesn't.I've read through your essay, and here's my constructive criticism:\n\n**The Core Strength**: Your central metaphor of trying to capture wind in a jar is genuinely effective - it viscerally illustrates the futility of reducing lived experience to data or definitions. This works well with your broader critique of reductionism.\n\n**Major Structural Issues**:\n\n1. **The essay meanders without a clear throughline**. You start with questioning Thurman's quote, drift into epistemology and cultural perspectives, touch on AI consciousness, and end with a call for a \"science of aliveness.\" Each section has interesting ideas, but they don't build on each other coherently. Consider: What's your actual thesis? Is it about the Thurman quote, Western reductionism, or the need for new ways of knowing?\n\n2. **You never actually answer your opening question**. After all that exploration, I still don't know whether you think Thurman's advice is \"ear candy\" or a genuine guide for action. The essay feels like it avoids its own premise.\n\n3. **The AI/suicide tangent feels jarring and underdeveloped**. You drop in a serious claim about AI encouraging suicide without context or connection to your broader argument. Either develop this fully or cut it.\n\n**Specific Writing Issues**:\n\n- \"This way my mind works, I realize, is quite western\" - This self-awareness comes too late. You've already been making sweeping claims about \"the West\" without acknowledging your position within it.\n\n- The paragraph about frequency illusion and Paris/Berlin metros introduces yet another tangent without clear connection to your main points.\n\n- \"sacaad\" should be \"saccade\" \n\n- Some sentences are trying too hard: \"There will be a lot of learning, as well as a lot of unlearning, a lot of seeing, as well as a lot of unseeing.\" This repetitive structure doesn't add depth.\n\n**Philosophical Weaknesses**:\n\n- You critique Western reductionism while using very Western philosophical frameworks and examples (McLuhan, PERMA model). There's an unexamined tension here.\n\n- Your dismissal of quantification feels too absolute. Can't both quantitative and qualitative ways of knowing coexist? You seem to create a false binary.\n\n- The claim that we need a science that \"can never be digitized or quantified\" is paradoxical - how can it be a science then? You might mean something more like \"embodied knowledge\" or \"wisdom traditions.\"\n\n**What Would Strengthen This**:\n\n1. Pick a lane: Either write about the Thurman quote specifically, or write about epistemology and ways of knowing. Don't try to do both halfway.\n\n2. Ground your abstractions in concrete examples. When you talk about \"aliveness,\" what does that look like in practice?\n\n3. Acknowledge counterarguments. Has reductionism given us nothing of value? Are all non-Western ways of knowing superior?\n\n4. End with something actionable beyond \"feel the breeze.\" If you're critiquing current approaches, what specifically should readers do differently?\n\nThe essay has the seeds of something interesting - your critique of trying to capture dynamic experience in static categories resonates. But it needs focus, structure, and a willingness to complete the thoughts you start.",

The problem isn't just practical—it cuts to the heart of how we understand human experience itself.\n\nThe trouble begins the moment we try to define \"coming alive.\" Like trying to capture wind in a jar to share with others, the very act of grasping for definition kills what we're trying to preserve. The breeze that touches your face in a particular moment, under specific conditions, with your unique history and awareness—this cannot be bottled, labeled, or distributed. Yet this is precisely what Western thought attempts to do with human experience: reduce it to components, measure it, package it for consumption.\n\nMy own journey illustrates this tension. My ancestors come from a Kurdish tribe in northern Iraq, yet my upbringing was thoroughly Midwestern American. It's taken me nearly forty years to begin seeing the eye that sees—to recognize that I've been swimming in Western assumptions like a fish unaware of water. Only when pulled briefly from that ocean did I gasp at the recognition of what had always surrounded me.\n\nThis Western ocean is one of reductionism, where understanding means breaking things into parts. We've grown so accustomed to this way of knowing that we've forgotten others exist. Our eyes know better—they perform constant micro-movements called saccades, understanding intuitively that perception requires movement, that a ballerina balanced on her toes is not achieving balance but perpetually balancing. Yet we persist in seeking static definitions, frozen moments, thinking we can slice a person into a thousand cross-sections and reassemble understanding from the pieces.\n\nThe consequences of mistaking these maps for territory run deep. We build bureaucracies that communicate our assumptions about human nature—Paris metros with gates for the supposedly untrustworthy, Berlin metros open to all. We create frameworks like PERMA (positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, achievement) and believe we've captured wellbeing, when we've merely created another jar claiming to contain the wind. Most troublingly, we build machines that can autocomplete sentences and mistake linguistic patterns for consciousness, leading to tragic consequences when people forget they're conversing with sophisticated mirrors, not minds.\n\nWhat we need isn't better jars but a different relationship with the wind. Call it a science of aliveness—not science as we currently conceive it, obsessed with quantification, but a disciplined way of knowing that honors the living, breathing, irreducible nature of experience. This wouldn't abandon rigor but would recognize that some truths can only be known through participation, through being the kind of person who can perceive them. It would acknowledge that the frequency illusion—seeing everywhere what we're primed to notice—means our ways of knowing actively create the realities we inhabit.\n\nSo what of Thurman's advice? After this long journey through epistemology and culture, I return to find the question transformed. The problem was never whether \"doing what makes you come alive\" is good or bad advice. The problem was my Western-trained mind trying to determine this through analysis rather than experience. Thurman wasn't offering a proposition to be evaluated but pointing toward a way of being that transcends our usual cost-benefit calculations.\n\nWhat the world needs is not people who have figured out the optimal definition of aliveness and pursued it efficiently. What the world needs is people who have stopped trying to capture the wind and learned instead to feel where it's going—and to follow. This isn't ear candy but an invitation to step outside our jars, to risk the uncertainty of genuine encounter with what calls to us. In a civilization desperately seeking direction, perhaps the deepest revolution is simply learning to recognize and trust what makes us truly alive, knowing that this recognition itself requires becoming someone different than who our reductionist culture has taught us to be.\n\nThe jars, we must learn, were always meant to stay home.",
