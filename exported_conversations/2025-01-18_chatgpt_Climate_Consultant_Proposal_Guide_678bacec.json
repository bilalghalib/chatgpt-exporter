Budget & Pricing (Lump Sum)\n\nIn line with Five One Labs’ requirements, I am providing a **lump sum price in Iraqi Dinar (IQD)** inclusive of all applicable taxes, translation costs, and any other incidental expenses. Below is an example structure of how you might present your final cost. You can add or remove line items depending on your cost breakdown style.\n\n| **Description**                                   | **Cost (IQD)** |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------:|\n| **Phase 1 & 2**<br/>Curriculum Review, Gap Analysis, Integration Outline | 1,000,000      |\n| **Phase 3**<br/>Content Development (English)                         | 1,200,000      |\n| **Phase 4**<br/>Translation to Arabic & Kurdish + QA                  |   800,000      |\n| **Phase 5**<br/>Final Revisions & Handover                            |   500,000      |\n| **TOTAL LUMP SUM**                                       | **3,500,000 IQD** |\n\n> **Note**:  \n> 1. The above numbers are purely illustrative. Your actual lump sum should reflect your own cost calculations.  \n> 2. This total price includes all required taxes, translation expenses, and administrative overheads.  \n> 3. Payment is expected upon satisfactory completion of final deliverables, with no advance payments as per Five One Labs’ policies.\n\n---\n\n### Payment Terms\n\n- **Payment Schedule**: One-time payment, post-completion of final deliverables (no later than February 25, 2025, unless negotiated otherwise).  \n- **Method**: **Bank transfer** or **bank letter**, per Five One Labs’ discretion.  \n- **Currency**: All payments will be made in **IQD**.\n\n---\n\n### Flexibility\n\nIf Five One Labs prefers a slightly different payment schedule (e.g., one milestone payment after Phase 3 and another after Phase 5), I am open to discussing options that align with organizational policies and practical requirements. However, I acknowledge that the default arrangement is to receive payment after delivery.\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis expanded **Work Plan, Timeline, and Lump Sum** section:\n\n- Demonstrates **how** you will complete the project over a 5-week period.  \n- Outlines **deliverables** at each phase.  \n- Provides a **clear budget** in IQD, inclusive of taxes and translations.  \n- Aligns with Five One Labs’ guidelines for payment terms and schedule.\n\nFeel free to adjust the breakdown of tasks, timelines, and budget figures to match your actual strategy and resources.",
