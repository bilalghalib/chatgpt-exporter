      "content": "You can interact with WhatsApp using Python scripts by leveraging the WhatsApp API, specifically through the WhatsApp Business API, or by using third-party libraries like `yowsup` or `pywhatkit`. Here's an overview of both approaches:\n\n### 1. WhatsApp Business API\nThe WhatsApp Business API is designed for medium and large businesses to efficiently manage and automate their WhatsApp conversations. It's a bit more complex and requires compliance with WhatsApp's policies.\n\n- **Set Up**: You need to apply for access to the WhatsApp Business API and set it up on a server.\n- **Implementation**: Use Python requests or a similar library to send and receive messages via HTTP requests to your WhatsApp Business API endpoint.\n- **Compliance and Limitations**: Make sure to comply with WhatsApp's policies and limitations regarding messaging.\n\n### 2. Third-party Libraries\nLibraries like `yowsup` or `pywhatkit` offer more straightforward ways to interact with WhatsApp, but they are not officially supported by WhatsApp and may have stability or compatibility issues.\n\n- **Yowsup**: A library that allows you to build a WhatsApp client. It's more complex but offers extensive features.\n  - **Installation**: Install it via pip (`pip install yowsup2`).\n  - **Usage**: Use its API to send and receive messages, manage contacts, etc.\n- **Pywhatkit**: A simpler library primarily used for sending messages.\n  - **Installation**: Install it via pip (`pip install pywhatkit`).\n  - **Usage**: Mainly for sending messages at a specified time. Can be used for basic automation.\n\n### Sample Code for Pywhatkit\n\n```python\nimport pywhatkit as kit\nimport datetime\n\n# Current time\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\n\n# Sending a message to a phone number at a particular time\n# Format for sendwhatmsg: phone number, message, hours, minutes\nkit.sendwhatmsg(\"+123456789\", \"Hello, this is a test message.\", now.hour, now.minute + 2)\n```\n\nThis code will open a web.whatsapp.com session and send a message after 2 minutes from the current time.\n\n### Note\n- **Compliance**: Always ensure that your use of these scripts complies with WhatsApp's terms of service to avoid being banned.\n- **Reliability**: The official API is more reliable for long-term and commercial use.\n- **Updates**: These libraries might break if WhatsApp updates its platform. Keep this in mind for maintenance.",
