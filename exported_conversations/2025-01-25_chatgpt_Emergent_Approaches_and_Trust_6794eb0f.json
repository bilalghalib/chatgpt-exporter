      "content": "Can you just clean up this long block of text and turn it into a letter to David and Dara - I want to keep my words almost exactly as they are, just correct the spelling and add some paragraphs and clarify if needed. Do not change my sentences or structure, just clean it up and organize it:\nI want to produce the essay that's stuck inside here, I want to write it for Munir and Dara my cofounders at Bloom.pm and help them see why I am convinced that we need emergent approaches, we need good people and trust that they will do beautiful things - not good systems that we attempt to shape people through. That the suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the masters house with the masters tools is becoming clearer and clearer to me and that I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people like ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. That it's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful, as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror, and that honor and dignity is worth more than continued funding from donors that don't trust us to treat us well. That even the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care, our connection, we need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful, a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. Something about relationship that we've been ailienated from - we text we don't call, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands and have systems with drop off at every stage vs the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres, and through them to their spheres, and beyond, through our connection with mentors we can transmit these new ways of seeing, these lived values, not as a list, as a lived experience and that is how we can trust that they get it. We will know, because we will see/feel it in our interactions iwth them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right, they will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality, we need to see them with the eye of quality, the eye of Goodness, Truth and Beauty, the eye that knows these things. And then we can have scalable systems, those people can impact the others, rather than think about scale in breadth - showing people how many people have jobs or planted trees - we need to get more comfortable with depth. how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change vs one which has \"good impact\" - impact, the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor, or an asteroid on the earth reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days, things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing. The idea of developing skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know, and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something, what if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and to access what their hearts are calling them towards? What if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out rather than pushing funding, expendatures, and movement that may be adding friction, doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone, with so much friction we certainly can burn people out (and have seen that on our own teams... what are we really doing?) why do we talk about wellbeing and stress - what if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community. We can move fast later, when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, I know you worry about the business failing, and that's ok, I sort of think that business might need to go. I don't know if you believe though, as I do, that good things live, true things find their homes, and that if we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and if we really focus on what is the problem that moves us, what brings us to life truely and sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood\" - i think we'll find something. It might be small, who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while, although I don't think that's so bad. What if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\" - perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world, maybe we need time to reflect and can work like einstien did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling isn't the time to rush, maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things... perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what i've been doing. i've been thinknig about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. the ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most \"effective\"\" - It's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate - Initially I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things - that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance. And still I think that externally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident, and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me - if you think about it, you will use your will to compell your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal, your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors (ends justify the means, think about it, especially when you are willing to use yourself as the means, of course anything can/should justify it. It's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when i was younger, when I was inspired by father greg boyle - when they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed, or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, care - these are all ends. Reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not percieved by the eye of rationality. THey are percieved by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, what beauty is, that eye is the one that I would like to cultivate. The neichze quote, he with a strong enough why can overcome any how guides me here, people who love have climbed mountains \"there ain't no mountain high enough\" there ain't no ocean vast enough, to keep them away from the beauty they want to do, babe. This is a real reason, this is a source of persistence, vitality, passion to knock on the thousand doors till one opens, this is the reason they'll leave our heart based aliveness focused program and join Ycombinator and get what they need financially, or figure something totally new and unexpected out. I'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, about the upside down pyramid, about start with why, about character strengths about come alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness based stress reduction for some people to better be able to manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. it's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct, what about that is meaningful for us that' sbeing lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echos within you. Those emotions are treasures and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra. Each tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist and sink into what we're doing and not be attached. Contentedness is not an emotion, it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing thigns and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small bold action. Similar to the zone that is described by the flow state where our skills are at the  edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at - we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of the calls. This means trust, implies process, moves people, businesses, projects and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future and planned. it's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise, it's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keep us alive(palestinians and lebanese) we saw how let down the people who can see this hypocracy felt. It's so true though, the goals, the SDGs, the plans, these things are dead on arrival, the reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on attainment of something. I know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact I'm confident, perhaps since you've known me for long enough you might accept it a bit more, yet for me it took me a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with aristotle and the idea of classification Historical Origins: Aristotle’s metaphysics focusing on cause-and-effect relationships (final cause, material cause ... percolate like water through the grounds of western culture and get amplified by the mechanistic thinking of the Scientific Revolution (Descartes, Newton) - I'm just a brain watching a world of parts interact sort of system thinking, Hobbes, oh crap christians are killing each other we're totally horrible and we need a rational govornment to put things in order, systems should be what we follow not people, enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, ladeeda democratic american let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion etc etc we live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that gallelio said is the perfect way to describe the world and it can all be displayed as a nice little info graphic - the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of conciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria and let's go fix that because death is bad, what about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about, probably, or even understand the impact of the history of ideas)  had. That we're here because of someone elses war freaking people out, our systems which destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans (and if there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to more efficiently achieve goals, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes? who cares if we breed them to be able to be transported across the ocean and have no idea what that does to the flavor, let alone nutritional profile, we must use these fear based epistemologies and ontologies that see the world full of nasty brutish people who will die shortly, unless we use our reason to align with the reason of the natural world, to break it up into leeetle pieces and use it to our favor, and BTW, the people who think like this, are more likely to be skiing inth alps and owning the businesses than running it. Also their kids don't go to Public schools and get graded like screws and meat of varying quality, by th way, I'm more of a B/B+  sort of person than a Grade A, so here doing this thinking is a bit out of my weight class, yet I digress and I try anyway to help you see, feel and understand this foundational thing. It's NOT about the wrong goals, profit or SDGs, it's not even about the systems leveraging personal and professional growth to help transform the economic system into one that's better ofr people and planet, no it's about the way of seeing and understanding what a person is, what the world is, and the systems that emerge from that understanding. Our neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is sort of hard to argue with, market efficiency sort of works, so does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core, we can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy and resources and food all commodities which the markets manage valuing perfectly well. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short sighted efficiency of materiality. I've tried not to say God in this runon paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of instagram, or a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country - little pin ball bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love, that's some oxytocin and some seretonin floating around a blood stream in a body that wants to keep it's bodily integrity intact so that it can propogate itself and not die. You cannot learn darwins theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty, don't you know. There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this, you may have even felt this, if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost. These things have been bugging me for a long time, I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children, full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it, at our own expense. Sure this is all fine said typing on a macbook pro made by a capitalist company with 216 billion dollars in cash reserves, benefitting from the international trade that brings me coffee from etheopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe. Yet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness is and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that. A little each day, weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet ... somehow I think that goes against my point here. That we need to see each other, even our messy each other. That this is from my heart to yours, I'm writing this with you Dara and you Munir in mind. It's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey - where I've felt off, yet I aquiessed allowing my doubt in my own feeling to fester. I thought, maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way, maybe I'm wrong, maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do, that the upside down pyramid, self efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, 1-1s, 1% better journey was about that. that goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, yet they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon, become a runner. We've talked about these. Yet more foundationally is this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on, that we should measure at the end of the day, and attend to our sources of meaning at the start, that the story of self and the story of the world can/must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to be able to see/echo/resonate with and inspire knowledge and action, that togetherness matters, that being a mirror matters, that finding emotions is precious, that discernment between emotions and state matters, that goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice, that we can go slow, that we can be gentle with ourselves, that we are successful once we start on the path to self knowledge and alignment with values perception and enaction. I think sometimes you must think that I'm crazy, and perhaps I am. Although I'm working on developing my ideas, gathering stories (micro finance was beautiful, right? Amu Yunus got a nobel prise, cool? well, we're seeing the fruits of not foundationally changing the perception of what finance is, what money is, what it serves, what a human is with a spate of suicides as a result of not being able to pay the petty sum back and being hounded by people who are achieving \"targets\" - targets, pretty grim. https://www.theafricareport.com/329702/microfinance-suicides-show-africans-must-beware-of-excessive-debt/\n\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no it's not only because we don't have money to have paid holidays, there's something burney about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions, we must treat people as ends - and get close. Relationships matter, commtiment matters, connection matters, scale can happen, in a beautiful and authentic way, and probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again. I sometimes think perhaps I've been saved from success, because I'm not sure I would have had the time, perspective, and frustration quite frankly to see as I do. Am I just \"sour grapesing\" this whole thing? I don't think so, I think indigenous economics talking about cyclical time (not linear) thinking 7 generations (not retire when I'm 40), relationships with a world of meaning (not humans and nature as resources to extract) - are similar, yet indigenous economics stays small and sort of implies we must take their principles and ways of doing things rather than discovering them ourselves in our own indegenatiy - our Lebanese indigenous economics... emerging from systems built by people who have re-integrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic, and the eyes of meaning and quality. And beingconfident enough to know we need to be wary of too much planning in an era of collapse, we need to live in a way that when the bombs drop, or the seas start rising, we are confident we did what we were made to do, and were successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not. I hope this short essay made some sense, I wanted to share this to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic. I think this is what I want to do next for work, to operationalize this process of first recognizing the perceptual faculty that we're being gas-lit not to identify (that artists usually are pretty clear about, good ones at least), that that faculty can see things and know things that are both //realiable// and //true// - that just as reason can see and we can deduce truth, we can do that with quality as well, that this faculty can help us identify our sources of meaning, the things that matter to us, that by finding that and living them more in our lives we come alive, and that coming alive brings energy and goodness, and that through this process we build capacity, skills, relationships, knowledge stories of self, stories of world to dynamically move through the world without artifice. That we all need to awaken the artist within us to help us weave a more beautiful story, that is just as true, and perhaps more true. To undo the fragility of systems and unearth the beauty and humility of emergence. I don't think I intend to \"get by\" anymore with my work, I have to share what I know or I shrivel up and help no one. I remember being asked in 2016 to make an entrepreneurship program and I thought it was silly to have everyone do the same assignments, I thought it would be cool to direct people to the things they needed with technology and today I'm going back again and having another one of those moments where I can't do the same thing anymore. I need to do something different, beautiful, and I'd love to do it with you - if you're in with me :)",

I want to write it for Munir and Dara, my cofounders at Bloom.pm, and help you see why I am convinced that we need emergent approaches. We need good people and trust that they will do beautiful things—not good systems that we attempt to shape people through.\n\nThe suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the master's house with the master's tools are becoming clearer and clearer to me.

There's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage versus the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\n\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality.

This is a real reason, a source of persistence, vitality, and passion to knock on a thousand doors until one opens. This is why they'll leave our heart-based aliveness-focused program and join Y Combinator to get what they need financially or figure something totally new and unexpected out.\n\nI'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, the upside-down pyramid, starting with why, character strengths, coming alive.

It's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise. It's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). We saw how let down the people who can see this hypocrisy felt. It's so true though—the goals, the SDGs, the plans—these things are dead on arrival. The reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on the attainment of something.\n\nI know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact, I'm confident that since you've known me long enough, you might accept it a bit more. Yet for me, it took a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with Aristotle and the idea of classification. Aristotle’s metaphysics focus on cause-and-effect relationships (final cause, material cause) percolate like water through the grounds of Western culture and get amplified by the mechanistic thinking of the Scientific Revolution (Descartes, Newton). It's just a brain watching a world of parts interact—sort of system thinking, Hobbes. Oh crap, Christians are killing each other; we're totally horrible, and we need a rational government to put things in order. Systems should be what we follow, not people. Enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, laden with democratic American ideas like \"let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion,\" etc.\n\nWe live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause-effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that Galileo said is the perfect way to describe the world. It can all be displayed as a nice little infographic—the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of consciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria, and we go fix that because death is bad. What about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear-based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about or understand the impact of the history of ideas) had?\n\nWe're here because of someone else's war, freaking people out. Our systems destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans. If there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to achieve goals more efficiently, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes? Who cares if we breed them to be transported across the ocean and have no idea what that does to the flavor, let alone nutritional profile? We must use these fear-based epistemologies and ontologies that see the world full of nasty, brutish people who will die shortly unless we use our reason to align with the reason of the natural world, to break it up into little pieces and use it to our favor. And BTW, the people who think like this are more likely to be skiing in the Alps and owning businesses than running them. Also, their kids don't go to public schools and get graded like screws and meat of varying quality. By the way, I'm more of a B/B+ sort of person than a Grade A, so here, doing this thinking is a bit out of my weight class. Yet I digress, and I try anyway to help you see, feel, and understand this foundational thing.\n\nIt's NOT about the wrong goals, profit or SDGs. It's not even about the systems leveraging personal and professional growth to help transform the economic system into one that's better for people and the planet. No, it's about the way of seeing and understanding what a person is, what the world is, and the systems that emerge from that understanding.\n\nOur neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is hard to argue with. Market efficiency sort of works, as does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core. We can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy, resources, and food—all commodities—which the markets manage, valuing perfectly well. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy-sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short-sighted efficiency of materiality.\n\nI've tried not to say God in this run-on paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of Instagram, a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country—little pinball bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love? That's some oxytocin and some serotonin floating around a bloodstream in a body that wants to keep its bodily integrity intact so that it can propagate itself and not die. You cannot learn Darwin's theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty—don't you know? There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this; you may have even felt this if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost.\n\nThese things have been bugging me for a long time. I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children—full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post-WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it at our own expense. Sure, this is all fine, said typing on a MacBook Pro made by a capitalist company with $216 billion in cash reserves, benefiting from the international trade that brings me coffee from Ethiopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe.\n\nYet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness are and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that—a little each day. Weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet somehow I think that goes against my point here. We need to see each other, even our messy selves. This is from my heart to yours. I'm writing this with you, Dara, and you, Munir, in mind.\n\nIt's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey—where I've felt off, yet I acquiesced, allowing my doubt in my own feelings to fester. I thought maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do—the upside-down pyramid, self-efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, one-on-ones, the 1% better journey were about that. Goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, but they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon; become a runner. We've talked about these.\n\nYet more foundationally, this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on: we should measure at the end of the day and attend to our sources of meaning at the start. The story of self and the story of the world can and must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to see, echo, resonate with, and inspire knowledge and action. Togetherness matters, being a mirror matters, finding emotions is precious, discerning between emotions and states matters, goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice. We can go slow, be gentle with ourselves, and be successful once we start on the path to self-knowledge and alignment with values, perception, and enaction.\n\nI think sometimes you must think that I'm crazy, and perhaps I am. Although I'm working on developing my ideas, gathering stories (microfinance was beautiful, right? Amu Yunus got a Nobel Prize, cool? Well, we're seeing the fruits of not foundationally changing the perception of what finance is, what money is, what it serves. What a human is with a spate of suicides as a result of not being able to pay the petty sum back and being hounded by people who are achieving \"targets\"—targets, pretty grim).\n\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no, it's not only because we don't have money for paid holidays; there's something burning about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions—we must treat people as ends and get close. Relationships matter, commitment matters, connection matters. Scale can happen in a beautiful and authentic way, probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again.\n\nI sometimes think perhaps I've been saved from success because I'm not sure I would have had the time, perspective, and frustration, quite frankly, to see as I do. Am I just \"sourgraping\" this whole thing? I don't think so. I think indigenous economics—talking about cyclical time (not linear) thinking, seven generations (not retiring when I'm 40), relationships with a world of meaning (not humans and nature as resources to extract)—are similar. Yet indigenous economics stays small and sort of implies we must take their principles and ways of doing things rather than discovering them ourselves in our own indigeneity—our Lebanese indigenous economics—emerging from systems built by people who have reintegrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic and the eyes of meaning and quality. Being confident enough to know we need to be wary of too much planning in an era of collapse. We need to live in a way that when the bombs drop or the seas start rising, we are confident we did what we were made to do and were successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not.\n\nI hope this short essay made some sense. I wanted to share this to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic. I think this is what I want to do next for work: to operationalize this process of first recognizing the perceptual faculty that we're being gaslit not to identify (artists usually are pretty clear about this, good ones at least). That faculty can see things and know things that are both **reliable** and **true**—just as reason can see and we can deduce truth, we can do that with quality as well. This faculty can help us identify our sources of meaning, the things that matter to us. By finding that and living them more in our lives, we come alive. Coming alive brings energy and goodness, and through this process, we build capacity, skills, relationships, knowledge, stories of self, and stories of the world to dynamically move through the world without artifice.\n\nWe all need to awaken the artist within us to help us weave a more beautiful story that is just as true, and perhaps more true, to undo the fragility of systems and unearth the beauty and humility of emergence. I don't think I intend to \"get by\" anymore with my work. I have to share what I know, or I shrivel up and help no one. I remember being asked in 2016 to make an entrepreneurship program, and I thought it was silly to have everyone do the same assignments. I thought it would be cool to direct people to the things they needed with technology. Today, I'm going back again and having another one of those moments where I can't do the same thing anymore. I need to do something different, beautiful, and I'd love to do it with you—if you're in with me :)\n\nWarm regards,\n\n**[Your Name]**",

I want to write it for Munir and Dara, my cofounders at Bloom.pm, and help you see why I am convinced that we need emergent approaches. We need good people and trust that they will do beautiful things—not good systems that we attempt to shape people through.\n\nThe suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the master's house with the master's tools are becoming clearer and clearer to me. I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people as ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. It's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror. Honor and dignity are worth more than continued funding from donors who don't trust us to treat us well.\n\nEven the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care and our connection are essential. We need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful—a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. There's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage versus the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\n\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality. We need to see them with the eye of quality—the eye of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty—the eye that knows these things.\n\nThen, we can have scalable systems where those people can impact others, rather than thinking about scale in breadth—showing how many people have jobs or planted trees. We need to get more comfortable with depth: how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude, making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change versus one which has \"good impact.\" Impact—the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor or an asteroid on the earth—reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days; things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing.\n\nDeveloping skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something. What if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and access what their hearts are calling them towards? What if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out, rather than pushing funding, expenditures, and movement that may be adding friction and doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone? With so much friction, we can certainly burn people out, as we've seen on our own teams. What are we really doing?\n\nWhy do we talk about wellbeing and stress? What if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, and built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community? We can move fast later when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, and I know you worry about the business failing, and that's okay. I sort of think that business might need to go.\n\nI don't know if you believe, as I do, that good things live and true things find their homes. If we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and truly focus on what is the problem that moves us and what brings us to life sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood,\" I think we'll find something. It might be small—who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while—although I don't think that's so bad.\n\nWhat if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\"? Perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things—perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what I've been doing.\n\nI've been thinking about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. The ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most effective\"—it's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate. Initially, I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things—that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance.\n\nExternally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley, and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me. If you think about it, you will use your will to compel your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal. Your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, and why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors who believe that the ends justify the means?\n\nIt's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when I was younger, inspired by Father Greg Boyle. When they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, and care—these are all ends, reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not perceived by the eye of rationality. They are perceived by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, and what beauty is. That eye is the one that I would like to cultivate.\n\nThe Nietzsche quote, \"He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how,\" guides me here. People who love have climbed mountains—\"there ain't no mountain high enough,\" \"there ain't no ocean vast enough\"—to keep them away from the beauty they want to do. This is a real reason, a source of persistence, vitality, and passion to knock on a thousand doors until one opens. This is why they'll leave our heart-based aliveness-focused program and join Y Combinator to get what they need financially or figure something totally new and unexpected out.\n\nI'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, the upside-down pyramid, starting with why, character strengths, and coming alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness-based stress reduction for people to better manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. It's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct? What about that is meaningful for us that's being lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echoes within you. Those emotions are treasures, and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra.\n\nEach tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist, and sink into what we're doing without being attached. Contentedness is not an emotion; it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing things and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small, bold actions. Similar to the zone described by the flow state, where our skills are at the edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at, we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of calls.\n\nThis means trust, implies process, and moves people, businesses, projects, and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive, organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future, and planned. It's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise. It's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). We saw how let down the people who can see this hypocrisy felt. It's so true though—the goals, the SDGs, the plans—these things are dead on arrival. The reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on the attainment of something.\n\nI know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact, I'm confident that since you've known me long enough, you might accept it a bit more. Yet for me, it took a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with Aristotle and the idea of classification.

Enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, laden with democratic American ideas like \"let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion,\" etc.\n\nWe live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause-effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that Galileo said is the perfect way to describe the world. It can all be displayed as a nice little infographic—the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of consciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria, and we go fix that because death is bad. What about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear-based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about or understand the impact of the history of ideas) had?\n\nWe're here because of someone else's war, freaking people out. Our systems destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans. If there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to achieve goals more efficiently, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes?

I wanted to share this to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic. I think this is what I want to do next for work: to operationalize this process of first recognizing the perceptual faculty that we're being gaslit not to identify (artists usually are pretty clear about this, good ones at least). That faculty can see things and know things that are both **reliable** and **true**—just as reason can see and we can deduce truth, we can do that with quality as well. This faculty can help us identify our sources of meaning, the things that matter to us. By finding that and living them more in our lives, we come alive. Coming alive brings energy and goodness, and through this process, we build capacity, skills, relationships, knowledge, stories of self, and stories of the world to dynamically move through the world without artifice.\n\nWe all need to awaken the artist within us to help us weave a more beautiful story that is just as true, and perhaps more true, to undo the fragility of systems and unearth the beauty and humility of emergence. I don't think I intend to \"get by\" anymore with my work. I have to share what I know, or I shrivel up and help no one. I remember being asked in 2016 to make an entrepreneurship program, and I thought it was silly to have everyone do the same assignments. I thought it would be cool to direct people to the things they needed with technology. Today, I'm going back again and having another one of those moments where I can't do the same thing anymore. I need to do something different, beautiful, and I'd love to do it with you—if you're in with me :)\n\nWarm regards,\n\n**[Your Name]**",

      "content": "**[Your Name]**  \n**[Your Address]**  \n**[City, State, ZIP Code]**  \n**[Email Address]**  \n**January 25, 2025**\n\n---\n\n**Dear David and Dara,**\n\n---\n\n### **Hypothesis**\n\nOur success at Bloom.pm hinges on adopting emergent, relational approaches that prioritize depth of impact and human connection over rigid systems and superficial scalability.\n\n---\n\n### **The Need for Emergent Approaches**\n\nI want to produce the essay that's stuck inside here. I want to write it for Munir and Dara, my cofounders at Bloom.pm, and help you see why I am convinced that we need emergent approaches. We need good people and trust that they will do beautiful things—not good systems that we attempt to shape people through.\n\n---\n\n### **Critique of Competitive Systems**\n\nThe suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the master's house with the master's tools are becoming clearer and clearer to me. I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people as ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. It's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror. Honor and dignity are worth more than continued funding from donors who don't trust us to treat us well.\n\n---\n\n### **Limitations of Digital Scalability**\n\nEven the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care and our connection are essential. We need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful—a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. There's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage versus the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\n\n---\n\n### **Depth vs. Breadth in Impact**\n\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality. We need to see them with the eye of quality—the eye of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty—the eye that knows these things.\n\nThen, we can have scalable systems where those people can impact others, rather than thinking about scale in breadth—showing how many people have jobs or planted trees. We need to get more comfortable with depth: how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude, making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change versus one which has \"good impact.\" Impact—the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor or an asteroid on the earth—reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days; things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing.\n\n---\n\n### **Moving from Disruption to Healing**\n\nDeveloping skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something. What if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and access what their hearts are calling them towards? What if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out, rather than pushing funding, expenditures, and movement that may be adding friction and doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone? With so much friction, we can certainly burn people out, as we've seen on our own teams. What are we really doing?\n\n---\n\n### **Sincerity and Avoiding Burnout**\n\nWhy do we talk about wellbeing and stress? What if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, and built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community? We can move fast later when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, and I know you worry about the business failing, and that's okay. I sort of think that business might need to go.\n\nI don't know if you believe, as I do, that good things live and true things find their homes. If we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and truly focus on what is the problem that moves us and what brings us to life sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood,\" I think we'll find something. It might be small—who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while—although I don't think that's so bad.\n\n---\n\n### **Building Community and Connection**\n\nWhat if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\"? Perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things—perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what I've been doing.\n\n---\n\n### **Personal Reflections and Inspirations**\n\nI've been thinking about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. The ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most effective\"—it's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate. Initially, I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things—that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance.\n\nExternally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley, and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me. If you think about it, you will use your will to compel your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal. Your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, and why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors who believe that the ends justify the means?\n\n---\n\n### **Rethinking Success and Habits**\n\nIt's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when I was younger, inspired by Father Greg Boyle. When they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, and care—these are all ends, reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not perceived by the eye of rationality. They are perceived by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, and what beauty is. That eye is the one that I would like to cultivate.\n\n---\n\n### **Relationality and Meaning**\n\nThe Nietzsche quote, \"He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how,\" guides me here. People who love have climbed mountains—\"there ain't no mountain high enough,\" \"there ain't no ocean vast enough\"—to keep them away from the beauty they want to do. This is a real reason, a source of persistence, vitality, and passion to knock on a thousand doors until one opens. This is why they'll leave our heart-based aliveness-focused program and join Y Combinator to get what they need financially or figure something totally new and unexpected out.\n\nI'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, the upside-down pyramid, starting with why, character strengths, and coming alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness-based stress reduction for people to better manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. It's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct? What about that is meaningful for us that's being lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echoes within you. Those emotions are treasures, and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra.\n\n---\n\n### **Embracing Emotions and Meaning**\n\nEach tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist, and sink into what we're doing without being attached. Contentedness is not an emotion; it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing things and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small, bold actions. Similar to the zone described by the flow state, where our skills are at the edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at, we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of calls.\n\n---\n\n### **Critique of Neoliberalism and Reductionism**\n\nThis means trust, implies process, and moves people, businesses, projects, and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive, organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future, and planned. It's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise. It's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). We saw how let down the people who can see this hypocrisy felt. It's so true though—the goals, the SDGs, the plans—these things are dead on arrival. The reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on the attainment of something.\n\nI know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact, I'm confident that since you've known me long enough, you might accept it a bit more. Yet for me, it took a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with Aristotle and the idea of classification. Aristotle’s metaphysics focus on cause-and-effect relationships (final cause, material cause) percolate like water through the grounds of Western culture and get amplified by the mechanistic thinking of the Scientific Revolution (Descartes, Newton). It's just a brain watching a world of parts interact—sort of system thinking, Hobbes. Oh crap, Christians are killing each other; we're totally horrible, and we need a rational government to put things in order. Systems should be what we follow, not people. Enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, laden with democratic American ideas like \"let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion,\" etc.\n\nWe live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause-effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that Galileo said is the perfect way to describe the world. It can all be displayed as a nice little infographic—the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of consciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria, and we go fix that because death is bad. What about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear-based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about or understand the impact of the history of ideas) had?\n\n---\n\n### **Indigenous Economics and Cyclical Thinking**\n\nWe're here because of someone else's war, freaking people out. Our systems destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans. If there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to achieve goals more efficiently, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes? Who cares if we breed them to be transported across the ocean and have no idea what that does to the flavor, let alone nutritional profile? We must use these fear-based epistemologies and ontologies that see the world full of nasty, brutish people who will die shortly unless we use our reason to align with the reason of the natural world, to break it up into little pieces and use it to our favor. And BTW, the people who think like this are more likely to be skiing in the Alps and owning businesses than running them. Also, their kids don't go to public schools and get graded like screws and meat of varying quality. By the way, I'm more of a B/B+ sort of person than a Grade A, so here, doing this thinking is a bit out of my weight class. Yet I digress, and I try anyway to help you see, feel, and understand this foundational thing.\n\nIt's NOT about the wrong goals, profit or SDGs. It's not even about the systems leveraging personal and professional growth to help transform the economic system into one that's better for people and the planet. No, it's about the way of seeing and understanding what a person is, what the world is, and the systems that emerge from that understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **Vision for Social Impact**\n\nOur neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is hard to argue with. Market efficiency sort of works, as does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core. We can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy, resources, and food—all commodities—which the markets manage, valuing perfectly well. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy-sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short-sighted efficiency of materiality.\n\nI've tried not to say God in this run-on paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of Instagram, a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country—little pinballs bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love? That's some oxytocin and some serotonin floating around a bloodstream in a body that wants to keep its bodily integrity intact so that it can propagate itself and not die. You cannot learn Darwin's theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty—don't you know? There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this; you may have even felt this if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost.\n\nThese things have been bugging me for a long time. I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children—full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post-WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it at our own expense. Sure, this is all fine, said typing on a MacBook Pro made by a capitalist company with $216 billion in cash reserves, benefiting from the international trade that brings me coffee from Ethiopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe.\n\nYet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness are and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that—a little each day. Weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet somehow I think that goes against my point here. We need to see each other, even our messy selves. This is from my heart to yours. I'm writing this with you, Dara, and you, Munir, in mind.\n\nIt's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey—where I've felt off, yet I acquiesced, allowing my doubt in my own feelings to fester. I thought maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do—the upside-down pyramid, self-efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, one-on-ones, the 1% better journey were about that. Goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, but they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon; become a runner. We've talked about these.\n\nYet more foundationally, this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on: we should measure at the end of the day and attend to our sources of meaning at the start. The story of self and the story of the world can and must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to see, echo, resonate with, and inspire knowledge and action. Togetherness matters, being a mirror matters, finding emotions is precious, discerning between emotions and states matters, goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice. We can go slow, be gentle with ourselves, and be successful once we start on the path to self-knowledge and alignment with values, perception, and enaction.\n\nI think sometimes you must think that I'm crazy, and perhaps I am. Although I'm working on developing my ideas, gathering stories (microfinance was beautiful, right? Amu Yunus got a Nobel Prize, cool? Well, we're seeing the fruits of not foundationally changing the perception of what finance is, what money is, what it serves. What a human is with a spate of suicides as a result of not being able to pay the petty sum back and being hounded by people who are achieving \"targets\"—targets, pretty grim).\n\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no, it's not only because we don't have money for paid holidays; there's something burning about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions—we must treat people as ends and get close. Relationships matter, commitment matters, connection matters. Scale can happen in a beautiful and authentic way, probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again.\n\nI sometimes think perhaps I've been saved from success because I'm not sure I would have had the time, perspective, and frustration, quite frankly, to see as I do. Am I just \"sourgraping\" this whole thing? I don't think so. I think indigenous economics—talking about cyclical time (not linear) thinking, seven generations (not retiring when I'm 40), relationships with a world of meaning (not humans and nature as resources to extract)—are similar. Yet indigenous economics stays small and sort of implies we must take their principles and ways of doing things rather than discovering them ourselves in our own indigeneity—our Lebanese indigenous economics—emerging from systems built by people who have reintegrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic and the eyes of meaning and quality. Being confident enough to know we need to be wary of too much planning in an era of collapse. We need to live in a way that when the bombs drop or the seas start rising, we are confident we did what we were made to do and were successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion and Call to Action**\n\nI hope this short essay made some sense. I wanted to share this to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic.

We’re limited by these foundational assumptions, which arise from historical precedents that taught us to see life as instrumental and transactional. There’s another way we once understood the world—one related to quality, meaning, and connection rather than quantity, materiality, and control. By reconnecting with this sense of meaning, we can create new foundations for new types of systems to emerge. The wonderful thing is that this reconnection also helps us come alive.\n\nIn the pages below, I’m going to show you how I reached this conviction, why it matters for us at Bloom.pm, and how it might change the way we operate. I’ll walk through the problems with existing systems, the importance of depth over breadth, the cost of chasing impact without humanity, and the possibility of forging something different, more relational, and more beautiful.\n\n---\n\n## **Core Hypothesis**\n\n> **Systems emerge from our beliefs and mindsets about the world and about humans. Historically, those beliefs have led us to live in an instrumental and transactional way. But we have lost an older perspective grounded in quality, not quantity—something intimately connected to meaning rather than mere materiality. By reconnecting with that perspective, we can lay a new foundation for truly emergent systems. And the act of reconnecting to it helps us come alive.**\n\n---\n\n## **Telling You What I Need to Tell You**\n\nBelow is the original text of my long letter—clustered under themes—to illustrate why I believe the above hypothesis matters and how it plays out in our work together. I’ve left my words intact (except for slight structural groupings), so you can see exactly how I arrived at these reflections.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 1: The Need for Emergent Approaches**\n\nI want to produce the essay that's stuck inside here. I want to write it for Munir and Dara, my cofounders at Bloom.pm, and help you see why I am convinced that we need emergent approaches. We need good people and trust that they will do beautiful things—not good systems that we attempt to shape people through.\n\nThe suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the master's house with the master's tools are becoming clearer and clearer to me. I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people as ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. It's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror. Honor and dignity are worth more than continued funding from donors who don't trust us to treat us well.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 2: Limitations of Digital Scalability**\n\nEven the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care and our connection are essential. We need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful—a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. There's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage versus the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 3: Depth vs. Breadth in Impact**\n\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality. We need to see them with the eye of quality—the eye of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty—the eye that knows these things.\n\nThen, we can have scalable systems where those people can impact others, rather than thinking about scale in breadth—showing how many people have jobs or planted trees. We need to get more comfortable with depth: how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude, making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change versus one which has \"good impact.\" Impact—the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor or an asteroid on the earth—reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days; things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 4: Moving from Disruption to Healing**\n\nDeveloping skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something. What if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and access what their hearts are calling them towards? What if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out, rather than pushing funding, expenditures, and movement that may be adding friction and doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone? With so much friction, we can certainly burn people out, as we've seen on our own teams. What are we really doing?\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 5: Sincerity and Avoiding Burnout**\n\nWhy do we talk about wellbeing and stress? What if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, and built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community? We can move fast later when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, and I know you worry about the business failing, and that's okay. I sort of think that business might need to go.\n\nI don't know if you believe, as I do, that good things live and true things find their homes. If we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and truly focus on what is the problem that moves us and what brings us to life sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood,\" I think we'll find something. It might be small—who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while—although I don't think that's so bad.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 6: Building Community and Connection**\n\nWhat if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\"? Perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things—perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what I've been doing.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 7: Personal Reflections and Inspirations**\n\nI've been thinking about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. The ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most effective\"—it's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate. Initially, I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things—that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance.\n\nExternally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley, and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me. If you think about it, you will use your will to compel your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal. Your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, and why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors who believe that the ends justify the means?\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 8: Rethinking Success and Habits**\n\nIt's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when I was younger, inspired by Father Greg Boyle. When they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, and care—these are all ends, reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not perceived by the eye of rationality. They are perceived by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, and what beauty is. That eye is the one that I would like to cultivate.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 9: Relationality and Meaning**\n\nThe Nietzsche quote, \"He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how,\" guides me here. People who love have climbed mountains—\"there ain't no mountain high enough,\" \"there ain't no ocean vast enough\"—to keep them away from the beauty they want to do. This is a real reason, a source of persistence, vitality, and passion to knock on a thousand doors until one opens. This is why they'll leave our heart-based aliveness-focused program and join Y Combinator to get what they need financially or figure something totally new and unexpected out.\n\nI'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, the upside-down pyramid, starting with why, character strengths, and coming alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness-based stress reduction for people to better manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. It's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct? What about that is meaningful for us that's being lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echoes within you. Those emotions are treasures, and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 10: Embracing Emotions and Meaning**\n\nEach tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist, and sink into what we're doing without being attached. Contentedness is not an emotion; it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing things and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small, bold actions. Similar to the zone described by the flow state, where our skills are at the edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at, we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of calls.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 11: Critique of Neoliberalism and Reductionism**\n\nThis means trust, implies process, and moves people, businesses, projects, and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive, organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future, and planned. It's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise. It's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). We saw how let down the people who can see this hypocrisy felt. It's so true though—the goals, the SDGs, the plans—these things are dead on arrival. The reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on the attainment of something.\n\nI know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact, I'm confident that since you've known me long enough, you might accept it a bit more. Yet for me, it took a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with Aristotle and the idea of classification. Aristotle’s metaphysics focus on cause-and-effect relationships (final cause, material cause) percolate like water through the grounds of Western culture and get amplified by the mechanistic thinking of the Scientific Revolution (Descartes, Newton). It's just a brain watching a world of parts interact—sort of system thinking, Hobbes. Oh crap, Christians are killing each other; we're totally horrible, and we need a rational government to put things in order. Systems should be what we follow, not people. Enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, laden with democratic American ideas like \"let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion,\" etc.\n\nWe live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause-effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that Galileo said is the perfect way to describe the world. It can all be displayed as a nice little infographic—the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of consciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria, and we go fix that because death is bad. What about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear-based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about or understand the impact of the history of ideas) had?\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 12: Indigenous Economics and Cyclical Thinking**\n\nWe're here because of someone else's war, freaking people out. Our systems destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans. If there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to achieve goals more efficiently, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes? Who cares if we breed them to be transported across the ocean and have no idea what that does to the flavor, let alone nutritional profile? We must use these fear-based epistemologies and ontologies that see the world full of nasty, brutish people who will die shortly unless we use our reason to align with the reason of the natural world, to break it up into little pieces and use it to our favor. And BTW, the people who think like this are more likely to be skiing in the Alps and owning businesses than running them. Also, their kids don't go to public schools and get graded like screws and meat of varying quality. By the way, I'm more of a B/B+ sort of person than a Grade A, so here, doing this thinking is a bit out of my weight class. Yet I digress, and I try anyway to help you see, feel, and understand this foundational thing.\n\nIt's NOT about the wrong goals, profit or SDGs. It's not even about the systems leveraging personal and professional growth to help transform the economic system into one that's better for people and the planet. No, it's about the way of seeing and understanding what a person is, what the world is, and the systems that emerge from that understanding.\n\n---\n\n### **Theme 13: Vision for Social Impact**\n\nOur neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is hard to argue with. Market efficiency sort of works, as does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core. We can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy, resources, and food—all commodities—which the markets manage, valuing perfectly well. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy-sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short-sighted efficiency of materiality.\n\nI've tried not to say God in this run-on paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of Instagram, a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country—little pinballs bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love? That's some oxytocin and some serotonin floating around a bloodstream in a body that wants to keep its bodily integrity intact so that it can propagate itself and not die. You cannot learn Darwin's theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty—don't you know? There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this; you may have even felt this if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost.\n\nThese things have been bugging me for a long time. I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children—full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post-WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it at our own expense. Sure, this is all fine, said typing on a MacBook Pro made by a capitalist company with $216 billion in cash reserves, benefiting from the international trade that brings me coffee from Ethiopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe.\n\nYet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness are and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that—a little each day. Weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet somehow I think that goes against my point here. We need to see each other, even our messy selves. This is from my heart to yours. I'm writing this with you, Dara, and you, Munir, in mind.\n\nIt's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey—where I've felt off, yet I acquiesced, allowing my doubt in my own feelings to fester. I thought maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do—the upside-down pyramid, self-efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, one-on-ones, the 1% better journey were about that. Goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, but they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon; become a runner. We've talked about these.\n\nYet more foundationally, this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on: we should measure at the end of the day and attend to our sources of meaning at the start. The story of self and the story of the world can and must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to see, echo, resonate with, and inspire knowledge and action. Togetherness matters, being a mirror matters, finding emotions is precious, discerning between emotions and states matters, goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice. We can go slow, be gentle with ourselves, and be successful once we start on the path to self-knowledge and alignment with values, perception, and enaction.\n\nI think sometimes you must think that I'm crazy, and perhaps I am. Although I'm working on developing my ideas, gathering stories (microfinance was beautiful, right? Amu Yunus got a Nobel Prize, cool? Well, we're seeing the fruits of not foundationally changing the perception of what finance is, what money is, what it serves. What a human is with a spate of suicides as a result of not being able to pay the petty sum back and being hounded by people who are achieving \"targets\"—targets, pretty grim).\n\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no, it's not only because we don't have money for paid holidays; there's something burning about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions—we must treat people as ends and get close. Relationships matter, commitment matters, connection matters. Scale can happen in a beautiful and authentic way, probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again.\n\nI sometimes think perhaps I've been saved from success because I'm not sure I would have had the time, perspective, and frustration, quite frankly, to see as I do. Am I just \"sourgraping\" this whole thing? I don't think so. I think indigenous economics—talking about cyclical time (not linear) thinking, seven generations (not retiring when I'm 40), relationships with a world of meaning (not humans and nature as resources to extract)—are similar. Yet indigenous economics stays small and sort of implies we must take their principles and ways of doing things rather than discovering them ourselves in our own indigeneity—our Lebanese indigenous economics—emerging from systems built by people who have reintegrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic and the eyes of meaning and quality. Being confident enough to know we need to be wary of too much planning in an era of collapse. We need to live in a way that when the bombs drop or the seas start rising, we are confident we did what we were made to do and were successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: Reminding You That I Told You**\n\nSo, here’s what I’ve told you:\n\n1. **Systems** spring from our beliefs about humans and the world, and we’re bound by those beliefs like a dog that won’t cross an electric fence.  \n2. **Historical precedents** have led us to adopt a transactional, instrumental way of being, but there’s an older or deeper perspective that values quality, meaning, and connection.  \n3. **By reconnecting** with that lost perspective—one rooted in depth, relationship, and genuine care—we can create new foundations for truly emergent systems.  \n4. **Doing so** also helps us come alive, because it engages our real sources of meaning, allowing us to move beyond burnout and purely material pursuits.\n\nEverything in my letter above shows how these ideas apply directly to our work at Bloom.pm, to how we treat people, and to the way we approach impact, funding, community, and wellbeing. I believe that if we truly ground ourselves in a sense of meaning, we’ll naturally build something more beautiful, sustainable, and humane—something that can flourish even in the face of chaos.\n\nI hope this makes sense and clarifies my conviction. I’m sure there are gaps and places where I sound idealistic or even crazy. Yet I believe this is the best way to move forward, with authenticity and depth, even if it’s slower, even if it feels uncertain. If you’re in this with me, let’s figure out how to bring it to life.\n\nWarm regards,  \n**[Your Name]**",

Our historical and cultural inheritances have led us to operate in an instrumental and transactional way, emphasizing quantity over quality and materiality over meaning. In losing touch with another way of seeing—a way rooted in depth, relationship, and the sense of meaning—we lose the chance to come alive and build systems of genuine care.\n\nIn this letter, I will lay out why I believe we need emergent approaches that honor people as ends in themselves, rather than as means to achieve impact metrics or donor-driven goals. I will suggest that tapping into our sense of quality and reconnecting with our deeper sources of meaning can catalyze a truly new foundation from which more authentic, life-giving systems can emerge. Finally, I’ll remind you (and myself) how all of this ties back to our work at Bloom.pm and the choices we face.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Why We Need Emergent Approaches**\n\nI want to produce the essay that's stuck inside here. I want to write it for Munir and Dara, my cofounders at Bloom.pm, and help you see why I am convinced that we need emergent approaches. We need good people and trust that they will do beautiful things—not good systems that we attempt to shape people through.\n\nThe suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the master's house with the master's tools are becoming clearer and clearer to me. I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people as ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. It's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror. Honor and dignity are worth more than continued funding from donors who don't trust us to treat us well.\n\n---\n\n## **2. The Limitations of Digital Scalability and the Power of Depth**\n\nEven the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care and our connection are essential. We need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful—a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. There's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage versus the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\n\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality. We need to see them with the eye of quality—the eye of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty—the eye that knows these things.\n\nThen, we can have scalable systems where those people can impact others, rather than thinking about scale in breadth—showing how many people have jobs or planted trees. We need to get more comfortable with depth: how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude, making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change versus one which has \"good impact.\" Impact—the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor or an asteroid on the earth—reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days; things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Moving from Funding Pressures to Healing and Sincerity**\n\nDeveloping skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something. What if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and access what their hearts are calling them towards? What if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out, rather than pushing funding, expenditures, and movement that may be adding friction and doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone? With so much friction, we can certainly burn people out, as we've seen on our own teams. What are we really doing?\n\nWhy do we talk about wellbeing and stress? What if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, and built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community? We can move fast later when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, and I know you worry about the business failing, and that's okay. I sort of think that business might need to go.\n\nI don't know if you believe, as I do, that good things live and true things find their homes. If we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and truly focus on what is the problem that moves us and what brings us to life sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood,\" I think we'll find something. It might be small—who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while—although I don't think that's so bad.\n\nWhat if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\"? Perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things—perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what I've been doing.\n\n---\n\n## **4. The Journey Toward “Coming Alive”**\n\nI've been thinking about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. The ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most effective\"—it's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate. Initially, I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things—that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance.\n\nExternally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley, and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me. If you think about it, you will use your will to compel your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal. Your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, and why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors who believe that the ends justify the means?\n\nIt's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when I was younger, inspired by Father Greg Boyle. When they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, and care—these are all ends, reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not perceived by the eye of rationality. They are perceived by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, and what beauty is. That eye is the one that I would like to cultivate.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Emotions, Flow, and Meaning**\n\nThe Nietzsche quote, \"He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how,\" guides me here. People who love have climbed mountains—\"there ain't no mountain high enough,\" \"there ain't no ocean vast enough\"—to keep them away from the beauty they want to do. This is a real reason, a source of persistence, vitality, and passion to knock on a thousand doors until one opens. This is why they'll leave our heart-based aliveness-focused program and join Y Combinator to get what they need financially or figure something totally new and unexpected out.\n\nI'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, the upside-down pyramid, starting with why, character strengths, and coming alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness-based stress reduction for people to better manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. It's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct? What about that is meaningful for us that's being lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echoes within you. Those emotions are treasures, and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra.\n\nEach tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist, and sink into what we're doing without being attached. Contentedness is not an emotion; it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing things and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small, bold actions. Similar to the zone described by the flow state, where our skills are at the edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at, we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of calls.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Critiquing “Dead on Arrival” Systems**\n\nThis means trust, implies process, and moves people, businesses, projects, and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive, organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future, and planned. It's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise. It's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). We saw how let down the people who can see this hypocrisy felt. It's so true though—the goals, the SDGs, the plans—these things are dead on arrival. The reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on the attainment of something.\n\nI know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact, I'm confident that since you've known me long enough, you might accept it a bit more. Yet for me, it took a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with Aristotle and the idea of classification. Aristotle’s metaphysics focus on cause-and-effect relationships (final cause, material cause) percolate like water through the grounds of Western culture and get amplified by the mechanistic thinking of the Scientific Revolution (Descartes, Newton). It's just a brain watching a world of parts interact—sort of system thinking, Hobbes. Oh crap, Christians are killing each other; we're totally horrible, and we need a rational government to put things in order. Systems should be what we follow, not people. Enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, laden with democratic American ideas like \"let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion,\" etc.\n\nWe live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause-effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that Galileo said is the perfect way to describe the world. It can all be displayed as a nice little infographic—the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of consciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria, and we go fix that because death is bad. What about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear-based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about or understand the impact of the history of ideas) had?\n\n---\n\n## **7. Indigenous Economics, Cyclical Thinking, and Our Own Indigeneity**\n\nWe're here because of someone else's war, freaking people out. Our systems destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans. If there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to achieve goals more efficiently, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes? Who cares if we breed them to be transported across the ocean and have no idea what that does to the flavor, let alone nutritional profile? We must use these fear-based epistemologies and ontologies that see the world full of nasty, brutish people who will die shortly unless we use our reason to align with the reason of the natural world, to break it up into little pieces and use it to our favor. And BTW, the people who think like this are more likely to be skiing in the Alps and owning businesses than running them. Also, their kids don't go to public schools and get graded like screws and meat of varying quality. By the way, I'm more of a B/B+ sort of person than a Grade A, so here, doing this thinking is a bit out of my weight class. Yet I digress, and I try anyway to help you see, feel, and understand this foundational thing.\n\nIt's NOT about the wrong goals, profit or SDGs. It's not even about the systems leveraging personal and professional growth to help transform the economic system into one that's better for people and the planet. No, it's about the way of seeing and understanding what a person is, what the world is, and the systems that emerge from that understanding.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Reconnecting Meaning and Materiality**\n\nOur neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is hard to argue with. Market efficiency sort of works, as does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core. We can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy, resources, and food—all commodities—which the markets manage, valuing perfectly well. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy-sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short-sighted efficiency of materiality.\n\nI've tried not to say God in this run-on paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of Instagram, a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country—little pinballs bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love? That's some oxytocin and some serotonin floating around a bloodstream in a body that wants to keep its bodily integrity intact so that it can propagate itself and not die. You cannot learn Darwin's theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty—don't you know? There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this; you may have even felt this if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost.\n\nThese things have been bugging me for a long time. I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children—full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post-WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it at our own expense. Sure, this is all fine, said typing on a MacBook Pro made by a capitalist company with $216 billion in cash reserves, benefiting from the international trade that brings me coffee from Ethiopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe.\n\nYet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness are and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that—a little each day. Weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet somehow I think that goes against my point here. We need to see each other, even our messy selves. This is from my heart to yours. I'm writing this with you, Dara, and you, Munir, in mind.\n\nIt's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey—where I've felt off, yet I acquiesced, allowing my doubt in my own feelings to fester. I thought maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do—the upside-down pyramid, self-efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, one-on-ones, the 1% better journey were about that. Goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, but they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon; become a runner. We've talked about these.\n\nYet more foundationally, this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on: we should measure at the end of the day and attend to our sources of meaning at the start. The story of self and the story of the world can and must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to see, echo, resonate with, and inspire knowledge and action. Togetherness matters, being a mirror matters, finding emotions is precious, discerning between emotions and states matters, goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice. We can go slow, be gentle with ourselves, and be successful once we start on the path to self-knowledge and alignment with values, perception, and enaction.\n\n---\n\n## **9. Conclusion: Reminding You What I Told You**\n\nSo, here’s what I’ve told you: **We are limited by our foundational beliefs**—like dogs trained not to cross an electric fence. **These beliefs come from a long historical thread** that has shaped how we see people and systems, often in purely instrumental, transactional ways. We have **lost touch with a deeper sense of quality and meaning**—one that can guide us to build new kinds of systems, rooted in connection, trust, and aliveness. The wonderful part is that by connecting with that sense of meaning, we actually **come alive** and create room for a truly different approach to work, community, and impact.\n\nI hope this short essay made some sense. I wanted to share it to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic, and to invite you into this conversation about foundational beliefs, emergent approaches, and meaningful depth over superficial breadth. I think this is what I want to do next for work: to operationalize the process of recognizing the perceptual faculty that we're being gaslit not to identify (the one artists often see so clearly), the faculty that can see both what is **true** and what is **good**. This helps us identify our sources of meaning and live them more in our lives, building capacity, relationships, and real alignment without artifice. It’s about weaving a more beautiful story, undone from the fragility of purely transactional systems, and rediscovering our humility in emergence.\n\nI don’t intend to \"get by\" anymore. I have to share what I know or I shrivel up and help no one. I remember being asked in 2016 to make an entrepreneurship program, and I thought it was silly to have everyone do the same assignments. I imagined a way to direct people to what they specifically needed, to let them come alive. Today, I’m returning to that impulse and realizing I can’t just do the same old thing. I need to do something different and beautiful, and I'd love to do it with you—**if you’re in with me.**\n\n---\n\n**Warm regards,**  \n**[Your Name]**",

I’ve inserted a brief **Core Hypothesis** section up front, integrating your new clarifications, and then rearranged the main essay. Where possible, I’ve preserved your original language and flow of thought.\n\n---\n\n## **Tell Them What We’re Going to Tell Them**\n\n**Dear David and Dara,**\n\nI want to produce the essay that's stuck inside here. I want to write it for Munir and Dara, my cofounders at Bloom.pm, to show you why I believe our systems emerge from our foundational beliefs and mindsets—about what the world is and what humans are. Like a dog that won't cross an electric fence, we are limited by our deepest assumptions, many of which are historically ingrained. The problem is that we have lost a way of relating to the world that honors quality and meaning over mere materiality, and I want to show you why reconnecting with that sense of depth helps us truly come alive. By coming alive and reconnecting with this lost way of seeing, we can build new kinds of systems that honor people as ends in themselves, not just means for achieving “impact,” “funding,” or “goals.”\n\nBelow, I’m going to walk you through:\n\n1. **Why emergent approaches matter more than rigid systems**  \n2. **Why our present mindset of “winners take all” and mastery is flawed**  \n3. **How honoring relationships, depth, and meaning (vs. breadth and metrics) can heal burnout**  \n4. **Why I think we can form a better foundation for Bloom.pm by coming alive first, then building systems**  \n\nI’ll share the personal reflections, doubts, and inspirations that led me here. Then, I’ll remind you, in the end, what I told you.\n\n---\n\n## **Tell Them**\n\n### **Core Hypothesis: Systems Emerge From Our Foundational Beliefs**\n\nThe suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the master's house with the master's tools are becoming clearer and clearer to me. I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people as ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. It's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror. Honor and dignity are worth more than continued funding from donors who don't trust us to treat us well.\n\nI am convinced that we need emergent approaches—good people and trust that they will do beautiful things—not good systems we attempt to shape people through. We are kind of limited by our foundational beliefs and understandings. Historically, these beliefs have led us to live in a way that is instrumental and transactional. We lost a different way we once had of seeing the world—one related to quality, to a sense of meaning, not just materiality.\n\n---\n\n### **Why Emergent Approaches Over Rigid Systems?**\n\nEven the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care and our connection are essential. We need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful—a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. There's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage instead of leaning into the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\n\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality. We need to see them with the eye of quality—the eye of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty—the eye that knows these things.\n\n---\n\n### **Critique of the “Winners Take All” Mindset**\n\nDeveloping skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something. What if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and access what their hearts are calling them towards?\n\nWhat if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out, rather than pushing funding, expenditures, and movement that may be adding friction and doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone? With so much friction, we can certainly burn people out, as we've seen on our own teams. What are we really doing?\n\n---\n\n### **Relationships, Depth, and Healing Burnout**\n\nThen, we can have scalable systems where those people can impact others, rather than thinking about scale in breadth—showing how many people have jobs or planted trees. We need to get more comfortable with depth: how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude, making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change versus one which has \"good impact.\" Impact—the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor or an asteroid on the earth—reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days; things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing.\n\nWhy do we talk about wellbeing and stress? What if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, and built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community? We can move fast later when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, and I know you worry about the business failing, and that's okay. I sort of think that business might need to go.\n\n---\n\n### **Foundational Beliefs and Historical Context**\n\nI don't know if you believe, as I do, that good things live and true things find their homes. If we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and truly focus on the problem that moves us and what brings us to life sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood,\" I think we'll find something. It might be small—who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while—although I don't think that's so bad.\n\nWhat if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\"? Perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things—perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what I've been doing.\n\n---\n\n### **Personal Reflections: Coming Alive**\n\nI've been thinking about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. The ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most effective\"—it's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate. Initially, I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things—that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance.\n\nExternally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley, and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me. If you think about it, you will use your will to compel your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal. Your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, and why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors who believe that the ends justify the means?\n\n---\n\n### **Relationality, Love, and Meaning as Ends**\n\nIt's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when I was younger, inspired by Father Greg Boyle. When they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, and care—these are all ends, reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not perceived by the eye of rationality. They are perceived by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, and what beauty is. That eye is the one that I would like to cultivate.\n\nThe Nietzsche quote, \"He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how,\" guides me here. People who love have climbed mountains—\"there ain't no mountain high enough,\" \"there ain't no ocean vast enough\"—to keep them away from the beauty they want to do. This is a real reason, a source of persistence, vitality, and passion to knock on a thousand doors until one opens. This is why they'll leave our heart-based aliveness-focused program and join Y Combinator to get what they need financially or figure something totally new and unexpected out.\n\nI'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, the upside-down pyramid, starting with why, character strengths, and coming alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness-based stress reduction for people to better manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. It's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct? What about that is meaningful for us that's being lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echoes within you. Those emotions are treasures, and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra.\n\n---\n\n### **Emotions as Messengers of Meaning**\n\nEach tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist, and sink into what we're doing without being attached. Contentedness is not an emotion; it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing things and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small, bold actions. Similar to the zone described by the flow state, where our skills are at the edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at, we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of calls.\n\n---\n\n### **Where the Current System Falls Short**\n\nThis means trust, implies process, and moves people, businesses, projects, and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive, organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future, and planned. It's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise. It's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). We saw how let down the people who can see this hypocrisy felt. It's so true though—the goals, the SDGs, the plans—these things are dead on arrival.

Yet for me, it took a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with Aristotle and the idea of classification.

It can all be displayed as a nice little infographic—the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of consciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria, and we go fix that because death is bad.

Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of Instagram, a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country—little pinballs bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love? That's some oxytocin and some serotonin floating around a bloodstream in a body that wants to keep its bodily integrity intact so that it can propagate itself and not die. You cannot learn Darwin's theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty—don't you know? There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this; you may have even felt this if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost.\n\nThese things have been bugging me for a long time. I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children—full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post-WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it at our own expense. Sure, this is all fine, said typing on a MacBook Pro made by a capitalist company with $216 billion in cash reserves, benefiting from the international trade that brings me coffee from Ethiopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe.\n\nYet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness are and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that—a little each day. Weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet somehow I think that goes against my point here. We need to see each other, even our messy selves. This is from my heart to yours. I'm writing this with you, Dara, and you, Munir, in mind.\n\nIt's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey—where I've felt off, yet I acquiesced, allowing my doubt in my own feelings to fester. I thought maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do—the upside-down pyramid, self-efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, one-on-ones, the 1% better journey were about that. Goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, but they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon; become a runner. We've talked about these.\n\nYet more foundationally, this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on: we should measure at the end of the day and attend to our sources of meaning at the start. The story of self and the story of the world can and must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to see, echo, resonate with, and inspire knowledge and action. Togetherness matters, being a mirror matters, finding emotions is precious, discerning between emotions and states matters, goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice. We can go slow, be gentle with ourselves, and be successful once we start on the path to self-knowledge and alignment with values, perception, and enaction.\n\nI think sometimes you must think that I'm crazy, and perhaps I am. Although I'm working on developing my ideas, gathering stories (microfinance was beautiful, right? Amu Yunus got a Nobel Prize, cool? Well, we're seeing the fruits of not foundationally changing the perception of what finance is, what money is, what it serves. What a human is with a spate of suicides as a result of not being able to pay the petty sum back and being hounded by people who are achieving \"targets\"—targets, pretty grim).\n\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no, it's not only because we don't have money for paid holidays; there's something burning about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions—we must treat people as ends and get close. Relationships matter, commitment matters, connection matters. Scale can happen in a beautiful and authentic way, probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again.\n\nI sometimes think perhaps I've been saved from success because I'm not sure I would have had the time, perspective, and frustration, quite frankly, to see as I do. Am I just \"sourgraping\" this whole thing? I don't think so. I think indigenous economics—talking about cyclical time (not linear) thinking, seven generations (not retiring when I'm 40), relationships with a world of meaning (not humans and nature as resources to extract)—are similar. Yet indigenous economics stays small and sort of implies we must take their principles and ways of doing things rather than discovering them ourselves in our own indigeneity—our Lebanese indigenous economics—emerging from systems built by people who have reintegrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic and the eyes of meaning and quality. Being confident enough to know we need to be wary of too much planning in an era of collapse. We need to live in a way that when the bombs drop or the seas start rising, we are confident we did what we were made to do and were successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not.\n\n---\n\n## **Remind Them of What We Told Them**\n\nSo there you have it. I’ve told you about:\n\n1. **How our systems emerge from deep-seated beliefs and mindsets**  \n2. **Why emergent approaches and depth of relationship matter more than quick, scalable fixes**  \n3. **How transactional and instrumental thinking leads to burnout, while real connection can heal and help us come alive**  \n4. **Why the historical context of our beliefs has stripped us of a sense of meaning and how reconnecting with that meaning might guide us forward**  \n\nI hope this short essay made some sense. I wanted to share this to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic. I think this is what I want to do next for work: to operationalize this process of first recognizing the perceptual faculty that we're being gaslit not to identify (artists usually are pretty clear about this, good ones at least). That faculty can see things and know things that are both **reliable** and **true**—just as reason can see and we can deduce truth, we can do that with quality as well.\n\nBy finding that and living it more in our lives, we come alive, and by coming alive we bring energy and goodness, building capacity, skills, relationships, knowledge, stories of self, stories of world—essentially forging a new foundation for new systems to emerge. We all need to awaken the artist within us to help us weave a more beautiful story that is just as true, and perhaps more true, to undo the fragility of systems and unearth the beauty and humility of emergence.\n\nI don't think I intend to \"get by\" anymore with my work. I have to share what I know, or I shrivel up and help no one. I remember being asked in 2016 to make an entrepreneurship program, and I thought it was silly to have everyone do the same assignments. I thought it would be cool to direct people to the things they needed with technology. Today, I'm going back again and having another one of those moments where I can't do the same thing anymore. I need to do something different, beautiful, and I'd love to do it with you—if you're in with me :)\n\n---\n\n**Warm regards,**  \n**[Your Name]**",
