      "content": "Got it — you’re asking about **percarbonate de soude** (sodium percarbonate). It’s basically powdered hydrogen peroxide (soda ash + hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water). It’s an **oxidizing cleaner**: good for whitening, degreasing, and removing stains, but not abrasive like baking soda crystals or scouring powders.  \n\nHere’s how you can use it safely on a **composite sink** (usually granite or resin composite):  \n\n---\n\n### ✅ How to Use Sodium Percarbonate\n1. **Dissolve, don’t scrub dry**  \n   - Mix 1–2 tablespoons of percarbonate in about 1 cup (250 ml) of warm (not boiling) water.  \n   - Stir until dissolved — the solution releases active oxygen.\n\n2. **Apply solution**  \n   - Pour or sponge onto the stained/dirty areas of your sink.  \n   - Let it sit 5–15 minutes (don’t let it fully dry, or it may leave a white film).\n\n3. **Light agitation**  \n   - Use a **soft sponge or cloth** (never steel wool or harsh scrubbers).  \n   - For stubborn spots, re-wet with fresh solution and gently rub.\n\n4. **Rinse thoroughly**  \n   - Rinse with plenty of clean water.  \n   - Wipe dry with a microfiber cloth to avoid mineral spots.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Safety & Precautions\n- **Avoid hot water >50 °C** — high heat can break it down too fast, making it less effective.  \n- **Don’t mix with vinegar or acids** — it will foam and neutralize (wasting its cleaning power).  \n- **Don’t use dry powder directly on the sink** — undissolved granules *can* be scratchy.  \n- For regular daily cleaning, just use mild soap + soft cloth; reserve percarbonate for whitening or stubborn stains.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Pro tip: For limescale (which percarbonate isn’t great at), follow up with **white vinegar rinse** after using percarbonate, but not at the same time. Use one, rinse thoroughly, then the other.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also suggest a **routine weekly care method** (using percarbonate only occasionally and something gentler for daily/weekly upkeep), so your sink stays bright without damage?",
