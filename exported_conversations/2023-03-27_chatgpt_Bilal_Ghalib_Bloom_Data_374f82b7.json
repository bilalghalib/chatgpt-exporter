      "content": "This is the last bit of context, are you ready? \nBilal answers questions about challenges and needs: What are your top three personal and professional learning goals at this stage in your career? How would you describe your current strengths and areas for improvement? Which aspects of Bloom.pm's growth and development are you most directly involved in or responsible for? What are the main challenges or obstacles you and Bloom.pm are currently facing? How do you see your role evolving within Bloom.pm in the near future? Are there any specific skills or knowledge areas you'd like to develop further to enhance your contributions to Bloom.pm? Based on your assessment results and the information provided so far, which activities from the list resonate the most with you and why? Do you have any preferences for the type of learning activity, such as reading, workshops, or online courses? 1) I would like to become more of an expert in something rather than a generalist. I feel like I'm all over the place and I have a hard time being seen as a professional both for my own self image and externally. I need to make more money as. my wife is pregnant and we'll need to manage larger expenses. Professional learning, I would like to learn transferrable skills that make me competitive in the job market while also being a rockstar at my own organization, Bloom. 2) I'm nerdy, great at research, I get lost on questions when they capture me like how should I use ChatGPT for work. And I ignore lots of important things that don't, which is a weakness. 3. I am responsible at Bloom for our curriculum and training. I'm a facilitator of a new program. I am also attempting to identify new program styles that we can run faster and for different audiences. We run training programs that use assessments and libraries of interventions to help people grow personally and professionally. If you have ideas about how to use chat GPT in that instance, give me a prompt showing that. 4. obstacles are that we need more clients, we are a nonprofit accelerator and our budgets are capped and we have a small amount of overhead for creativity, well-being activities at work, etc. We want corporate clients, or to sell the software we're making 5. I see myself stabilizing the organization and being focused on research, creative work, values alignment, working on new financial models to support social enterprises, new program design to bring those financial models to life, etc. 6. I want to learn more about economics and human values and international policy. I wonder if we can have a beautiful future of people living their values at work and also have the sort of scalable growth we have. Lots of question about meaning and money and life and death. 7. I'm interested in practical things I can do that involve others, reading a book or doing an activity alone won't captivate me. I should do something where we can work together - perhaps online on a zoom call that will help me share my research and also help the team connect and overcome my problem of procrastination and continual research by allowing myself to work with people who have a different mindset, the fishing sort of mindset that turns ideas into done. That's the problem I'm facing, how to stop innovating and get things to done, especially get things to done that we can sell. I'm also scared to call people - that fear leads to procrastination. 8. I prefer online courses and activities with great facilitation around areas I'm interested in. I also have a problem where I love reading yet I don't take good enough notes and even if I do I don't know how to turn notes into productive action for Bloom.\nbilal\nquestions and answers\nresponses from bilal\nEdit\nDelete\nTokens Estimate: ~906\nBilal Ghalib's scores for PERMAH March 27 2023 Results seen as category followed by score: Achievement 3.75 Engagement 4.33 Positive Emotion 4.33 Vitality/Health 3.83 Meaning 4.67 Relationships 3.33\nBilal\nscores\nassessment\npermah\nmarch 27 2023\nEdit\nDelete\nTokens Estimate: ~50\nBilal's universal skills scores, category followed by the score: Listening 3.2 Speaking 3.71 Problem Solving 3.4 Creativity 3.6 Staying Positive 3.29 Aiming High 2.43 Leadership 2.8 Teamwork 2.67\nbilal\nuniversal skills\nmarch 20 2023\nscores\nassessment\nEdit\nDelete\nTokens Estimate: ~49\nResults from Bilal's PERMAH (positivity, engagement, meaning, achievement and health) assessment taken March 27 2023: How much of the time do you feel you are making progress towards accomplishing your goals? 🎯 Achievement 3 How often do you achieve the important goals you have set for yourself? 🎯 Achievement 3 How often are you able to handle your responsibilities? 🎯 Achievement 4 How often do you become absorbed in what you are doing? 📈 Engagement 4 In general, to what extent do you feel excited and interested in things? 📈 Engagement 4 How often do you lose track of time while doing something you enjoy? 📈 Engagement 5 In general, how often do you feel joyful? 🙂 Positive Emotion 3 In general, how often do you feel positive? 🙂 Positive Emotion 4 In general, to what extent do you feel contented? 🙂 Positive Emotion 4 In general, how often do you feel anxious? 😞 Negative Emotion 3 In general, how often do you feel angry? 😞 Negative Emotion 1 In general, how often do you feel sad? 😞 Negative Emotion 2 In general, how would you say your health is? 🏋🏽 Vitality/Health 3 How satisfied are you with your current physical health? 🏋🏽 Vitality/Health 2 Compared to others of your same age and sex, how is your health? 🏋🏽 Vitality/Health 3 In general, to what extent do you lead a purposeful and meaningful life? ❇️ Meaning 4 In general, to what extent do you feel that what you do in your life is valuable and worthwhile? ❇️ Meaning 4 To what extent do you generally feel you have a sense of direction in your life? ❇️ Meaning 4 To what extent do you receive help and support from others when you need it? 🤝 Relationships 3 To what extent do you feel loved? 🤝 Relationships 3 How satisfied are you with your personal relationships? 🤝 Relationships 3 How lonely do you feel in your daily life? 😢 Lonely 2 Taking all things together, how happy would you say you are? 😀 Happiness 4\nassessment\nPERMAH\nBilal\nmarch 27 2023\nresults\nEdit\nDelete\nTokens Estimate: ~482\nFeedback coming from Bloom colleague, Mohammed, answering questions about Bilal: Questions: What specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process?

Avery, a long time friend of Bilal's who is passionate about impact, arabic language, refugees, religious person, young, just out of college, works in bloom on the library, and grant and proposal writing, reliable Questions: What specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process? Are there any challenges or opportunities within Bloom where you think Bilal’s strengths and expertise could be particularly valuable, and what actions should he take to address them? Based on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth? Avery answers: What specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process? Answer: I think that Bilal should work on qualitative analysis concepts so that he can guide Bloom's data collection and research efforts towards more actionable data outcomes. I think collaborating with our new M&E expert and taking on small data visualization projects would help him work towards this goal. Are there any challenges or opportunities within Bloom where you think Bilal’s strengths and expertise could be particularly valuable, and what actions should he take to address them? Answer: Bilal's emerging expertise with GPT and AI tools could help Bloom jump ahead of competitors. He should have space and support to implement new tools when possible. Based on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth? Answer: Bilal works best in conversation with other people, and he is inspired by experts and people who have thought deeply about subjects. Putting him in conversation with those experts would help him grow. The experts in the subjects he is most deeply interested in are typically located outside of Bloom.\nfeedback\navery\nfeedback for bilal\ncolleague\nEdit\nDelete\nTokens Estimate: ~620\nBloom colleague, Dara, answering questions about Bilal: Questions: What specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process? Are there any challenges or opportunities within Bloom where you think Bilal’s strengths and expertise could be particularly valuable, and what actions should he take to address them? Based on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth? Dara short profile: Dara, programs lead, sanguine personality, deep thinker, she was Bilal's previous mentee, the organized person creating lots of documentation and better at time management Dara's answers: Data analysis and research skills: We’ve been doing this in a bit of an ad-hoc way, and now, with Ghina’s skills and your brains (specifically imagination, ability to think abstractly and connect the dots in the bigger picture, and how you leverage technology), we can take it to the next level, and that can feed into our experiments and help us develop case studies, publish research, etc. This can also be a great combo because China is methodical and systematic and can help organize your experiments. Having you lead more scientifically designed research more systematically and consistently can help us identify more effective ways to develop our programs and be more responsive to the needs of participants. This also makes sense because you’re always the first to share and distill external research so we can try new things. And it puts you back on the conference trail: as we publish more, you can go around and present findings, leading to more projects. Based on my experience working with you, I know you enjoy exploring new ideas and experimenting with new approaches. I also know that you think better in dialogue. So you may benefit from having a research buddy (Ghina) and an experimentation buddy (me and the PMs) to help put things into the action.\nEdit\nDelete\nTokens Estimate: ~555\nFeedback coming from Bloom colleague, Habib, answering questions about Bilal: Questions: What specific skills or areas of expertise do you believe Bilal should develop or improve upon to make a more significant positive impact at Bloom, and can you recommend any learning resources or connections to help him in this process?

Being Realistic (in the sense of what could be achieved and at what level) Planning Are there any challenges or opportunities within Bloom where you think Bilal’s strengths and expertise could be particularly valuable, and what actions should he take to address them? Yes, helping everyone staying aligned on the core value of what we are doing. Bilal = Compass. (leading the towards the core value) I’m thinking, how would improving your planning skill and your being realistic skill would affect this role. How much when we are drawn to the plan and to the reality would prevent us from focusing on the core? V/S how much when we are too much focused on the core value would keep us stuck in a loop of iteration. Sounds like we have some interesting material to discuss. Based on your experiences working with Bilal, what kind of learning methods, environments, or support do you think would be most effective for him, and are there any colleagues or external connections he should collaborate with to maximize his growth?
