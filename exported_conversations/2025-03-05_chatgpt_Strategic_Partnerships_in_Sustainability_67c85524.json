Stay tuned for more updates as we embark on this exciting journey together, working towards a greener and more sustainable future!\"\n\nSlide: what alternative partnership (in iraq or at least in MENA) might be good to highlight here for green/sustainability/climate resilience instead of this: \"\"\"5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n* Starbucks has created several strategic alliances that have helped them increase sales and reduce costs related to production and distribution of their products. \n   * They partnered with Barnes and Nobles bookstores in 1993 to provide in-house coffee shops, benefiting both retailers.\n   * In 1996, Starbucks partnered with PepsiCo to bottle, distribute, and sell the popular coffee-based drink (Frappuccino). In this situation they benefited off of PepsiCo’s highly efficient manufacturing and distribution channels. \n   * A Starbucks – United airlines alliance has resulted in their coffee being offered on flights with the Starbucks logo on the cups\n* Ask: Why would a business want to form a strategic alliance? \n   * Sharing resources and expertise. \n   * New-market penetration. In some cases, a strategic alliance gives access to new markets with a solution that wouldn’t have been possible for either company on their own. For instance, companies going global often work with a trusted local partner to get an advantage in an emerging market.\n   * Expanded production. When it comes to manufacturing and distributing products, strategic alliances allow partners to increase their capabilities and scale quickly to meet demand.\n   * Drive innovation. With the right alliance, partners can outpace the competition with new solutions that are a complete package for their customers. These alliances are creative and revolutionary and change the market landscape in a dramatic way.\n   * Strategic alliances allow partners to scale quickly, build innovative solutions for their customers, enter new markets, and pool valuable expertise and resources. And, in a business environment that values speed and innovation, this is a game-changer.\n   * https://www.workspan.com/blog/strategic-alliance-definition/\nThis means that you and a company that you have no direct competition with, industry wise, will partner together in ways that will benefit the both of you.\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a strategic alliance (you don't have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\nLocal example: Mr. Erbil and Lala Candles joined together to create Mr. Erbil branded candles. They used Mr. Erbil's luxury brand name and Lala candles high quality product to create something new that they can both benefit from.\nSpotify and Uber: Leaping forward to a very recent piece of news, Spotify and Uber have partnered to provide stereo control to Uber customers. Not every Spotify consumer uses Uber, nor does every Uber rider has a Spotify account. The strategic alliance allows each company to pursue prospects from the other's existing customer base, all while continuing to promote both products.\nResource-sharing example: A business with excess warehouse space partners with a complementary business needing storage, reducing costs for both while optimizing resource use.\nEfficiency partnership: A restaurant partners with a local farm to secure reliable produce while reducing transportation costs and ensuring freshness. The farm gains a steady customer while the restaurant can market its locally-sourced ingredients.\nTechnology-sharing example: A clothing manufacturer partners with a tech company that has developed water-efficient dyeing technology. The clothing company reduces production costs through water savings, while the tech company gets to scale its innovation.\nYou can partner with a manufacturer to produce a part of your business product that you yourself may not be able to manufacture. This can include suppliers with expertise in resource-efficient materials or processes that help reduce your costs.\nStarbucks has created several strategic alliances that you can see on the next slide.\"\"\"EditBased on the documents provided, I can suggest some excellent alternatives to the Starbucks examples that highlight green/sustainability partnerships in Iraq or the MENA region. Here are a few compelling options:\nKESK Partnership Example\nKESK is a sustainable tech startup in Iraq that would make an excellent example to highlight. They've developed partnerships that demonstrate how green businesses can thrive through strategic alliances:\n\nKESK partnered with local businesses to install their solar-powered cooling solutions, helping these businesses reduce electricity costs by up to 70% while maintaining operations during power outages.\nThey've formed an alliance with agricultural producers to implement water-efficient irrigation systems, allowing farmers to continue production despite water scarcity while KESK expands their market reach.\nKESK has collaborated with educational institutions to provide training on renewable energy systems, building their brand while developing a skilled local workforce.\n\nOther Regional Sustainability Partnerships\n\nSchaduf (Egypt) partnered with urban building owners to create rooftop farms, providing building owners with improved insulation and reduced cooling costs while creating microenterprises for urban farmers.\nSekem (Egypt) formed strategic alliances with European organic food distributors, helping them access international markets while the distributors gained authentic, sustainable products from the region.\nJinni (UAE) partnered with hotels to provide on-demand home services using eco-friendly cleaning products, allowing hotels to offer additional guest services while Jinni expanded their customer base.\nSolarizEgypt developed partnerships with businesses across various industries to implement solar power solutions through innovative financing models, reducing electricity costs for businesses while scaling their renewable energy impact.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how partnerships focused on sustainability can drive innovation, reduce costs, access new markets, and create value for all parties involved - particularly important in a region facing significant climate challenges like water scarcity, extreme heat, and energy instability.\nWould you like me to develop any of these examples further or suggest how to integrate them into the specific slide format you're using?RetryBGcan you keep the text very similar to how it was originally? \ni need a few slides one for Buyer-Supplier Partner one for competetion partner A group of competing companies come together to develop a solution for a problem that they all share, and none of them would gain a competitive advantage and one for strategic alliance partnerEditI'll keep the text structure similar to the original while providing alternative partnerships focusing on sustainability in Iraq/MENA. Here are three slides with different partnership types:\nStrategic Alliance Partner\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nKESK has created several strategic alliances that have helped them increase sales and reduce costs related to production and distribution of their sustainable solutions.\n\nThey partnered with local businesses in Iraq to provide solar-powered cooling solutions, benefiting both companies.\nIn 2022, KESK partnered with agricultural producers to implement water-efficient irrigation systems. In this situation they benefited from the farmers' established networks while farmers gained resilience against water scarcity.\nA KESK – educational institution alliance has resulted in their technology being used in training programs with the KESK logo on the materials\n\n\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a strategic alliance?\n\nSharing resources and expertise.\nNew-market penetration. In some cases, a strategic alliance gives access to new markets with a solution that wouldn't have been possible for either company on their own. For instance, companies going green often work with a trusted local partner to get an advantage in an emerging market.\nExpanded production. When it comes to manufacturing and distributing products, strategic alliances allow partners to increase their capabilities and scale quickly to meet demand.\nDrive innovation. With the right alliance, partners can outpace the competition with new solutions that are a complete package for their customers. These alliances are creative and revolutionary and change the market landscape in a dramatic way.\n\n\n\nBuyer-Supplier Partnership\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nSchaduf in Egypt has created strong buyer-supplier partnerships that demonstrate sustainable supply chain relationships:\n\nThey partnered with urban building owners to create rooftop farms, where building owners provide the space and Schaduf supplies the technology and expertise.\nThe building owners benefit from improved insulation and reduced cooling costs while Schaduf expands their implementation sites.\nThis partnership creates additional value by generating employment for local community members who maintain the farms.\n\n\nAsk: How can buyer-supplier partnerships improve business sustainability?\n\nReduced transportation costs and emissions when working with local suppliers\nMore stable supply chains that can withstand environmental disruptions\nAbility to market sustainability credentials to environmentally-conscious customers\nJoint innovation to solve resource efficiency challenges that benefit both parties\nShared investment in green technologies that might be too costly for a single business\n\n\n\nCompetitive Partnership\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nSolar energy companies in the MENA region formed a competitive partnership to address shared challenges:\n\nCompanies like SolarizEgypt, Yellow Door Energy, and Enviromena collaborated to develop standardized installation practices and safety protocols.\nThese competing businesses worked together to advocate for regulatory frameworks that would benefit the entire renewable energy sector.\nThey jointly invested in workforce development programs to address the shortage of skilled installers, which was limiting growth for all companies.\n\n\nAsk: When does it make sense for competitors to work together?\n\nWhen facing common regulatory challenges that affect the entire industry\nTo establish industry standards that build consumer confidence in new technologies\nTo develop solutions for infrastructure problems that no single company can solve alone\nWhen the partnership expands the total market size rather than redistributing existing market share\nTo address sustainability challenges that affect all businesses in the region, such as water scarcity or energy reliability\"",

However, despite the country’s drilling capacity, citizens are faced with daily power outages and forced to pay high fuel costs.\nAdditionally, Iraq’s power grid is not structured to meet energy demands. The grid loses 40 to 50% of the power it produces, causing frequent outages. On average, Iraqi households and businesses receive six hours of power from the national power grid per day.\n\nPower outages aren’t just inconvenient, they’re dangerous. In July and August, temperatures in Iraq average 95 degrees Fahrenheit and regularly exceed 112 degrees. When power outages occur, air conditioning units are unable to run, which significantly increases the threat of heat stress and related illnesses even while indoors. Although some individuals and businesses run private gas- or diesel-powered generators during outages, they are often noisy and expensive.\n\n\n\nIn addition to being costly, generators are tough on the environment. Diesel exhaust alone contains more than 40 toxic air pollutants that are inhaled and sent into the atmosphere. Fossil fuels, like diesel, account for 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions, both of which have a major impact on climate change. However, there is a solution to providing reliable power daily that reduces strain on the national power grid and removes the need for generators: solar energy.\n\n\nSolar energy is not always accessible for business owners who are interested in a green solution due to the high initial investment for purchasing solar panels. According to KESK, the first greentech company in Iraq, the lack of adequate electricity supply is a major hindrance to productivity for 73% of small and medium-sized enterprise businesses (SMEs) in Iraq. For these businesses, when renewable energy solutions are purchased, a return on investment can be seen in three and a half years.\n\n\n\nTo help support businesses in accessing reliable energy, the Vitas Group (Vitas) is launching a financing initiative. Vitas is a for profit micro and small business lending arm of Global Communities that has a triple bottom line mission of financial inclusion, social and environmental impact. In seeking to create greater public awareness among business owners on how renewable energy can support their business needs, Vitas began looking into financing green energy loans. \n\n\nLearn more about Vitas Group\n\nPhoto by Ivana Cajina on Unsplash\n\nIn 2020, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) researched solar market needs in Iraq and found the serviceable size of the solar market could generate $20 billion. Despite this research, financial institutions were hesitant to support renewable energy projects. In response to IOM’s research, Vitas Iraq decided to launch a test product to determine the long-term viability of a solar financing option for businesses in Iraq.\n\nEveryone is interested in solar energy and the need is there for air conditioning, solar panel systems and refrigeration in businesses. However, financing a solar product can be challenging.” \nRola El Amine, Digital Business Innovation Manager for Vitas\nPhoto by Karsten Würth on Unsplash\n\nBefore Vitas launched a pilot solar loan program, they conducted their own market research to gauge the impacts of weather and power outages on local businesses. Vitas surveyed 85 business owners to confirm there was interest in solar energy and that businesses were willing to take loans to finance solar products.\n\nThe majority of survey respondents were thrilled to know that such a product solution could be introduced in the market. Financing solar products fulfills a need in the difficult time Iraq is facing.”\nMohammed Jawad, Marketing and Public Relations Manager for Vitas Iraq\nWith the market for solar power made clear, Vitas enlisted the help of the Vitas Lab to create an innovative solution. In 2020, Vitas launched the Vitas Lab as an innovation financing center focused on testing new ideas, creating new products, identifying new partnerships and driving responsible financial innovation. The Vitas Lab applies a design thinking approach to products and services at every step through conducting research, generating ideas, prototyping and testing. Specific focus is given to projects that have a social impact related to the environment, gender equity or financial inclusion. \n\n\n\n\nselective focus photography of light bulb\nPhoto by Kendall Ruth on Unsplash\n\nFinancing solar-powered solutions met the Vitas Lab’s initiative of creating innovative programs to address common pain points. Additionally, this project allowed the Vitas Lab to make a social impact through helping businesses access eco-friendly energy solutions.\n\nHowever, one challenge remained before Vitas could launch their solar loan program — a partnership. In May 2022, Vitas connected with KESK through a mutual business connection. KESK had searched for an outside lending institution to provide a financing option for business owners who were interested in its solar products but could not afford the initial cost or price of maintenance. When Vitas and KESK learned about each other, they found their values and business goals aligned.\n\nThe partnership between KESK and Vitas is a great fit, as it combines KESK's expertise in delivering solar energy solutions with Vitas' experience in providing microfinance services to SMEs in Iraq. Together, we are able to support the growth of the solar energy sector in Iraq and promote sustainable development.”\nBasima, Founder and CEO of KESK\n\nKESK was founded in 2018 by Basima, an Iraqi green-tech entrepreneur. The company offers diverse applications of green solutions, customized engineering, after sale support and digitized monitoring and evaluation of solar system performance. Run off Internet of Things (IoT) technology, KESK’s solar products measure and report the amount of energy saved in real time.\n\nKESK is a great partner for this project because of their focus on the environment and technological integration, which is something the Vitas Lab looks for in each project.\"\nRola El Amine, Vitas Group Digital Business Innovation Manager\nBasima founded KESK as a direct result of her passion for the environment and experience growing up in Iraq.\n\nGrowing up experiencing wars and climate change threats created a burning desire inside me to contribute to creating a prosperous future for my country. But I wasn’t sure how. One day I was sitting in my room and the power went off, the generator would not work, and I could no longer take it. I realized that the only choice is to rely on sustainable green solutions, which must be accessible, trusted and profitable. Hence, KESK was born.”\nBasima, Founder and CEO of KESK\n\nKESK’s all-star engineering, operations and business development teams delivered over 1,000 units of photovoltaic power across 20 solar energy projects in Federal Iraq and the Kurdistan Region in 2022. The company strives to have a long-term positive impact on Iraq’s environmental and economic future by putting less stress on the national grid and providing business owners with affordable ways to access green energy. Basima said she is proud to make ‘the green way‘ the easy way for local businesses.\n\nTo prove the viability of the green loan program and their innovative partnership to IOM, the Vitas Lab tested a solar loan project. For the test project, the Vitas Lab provided a local business with financing to receive a solar-powered AC unit from KESK in May 2022. The business was monitored from August to November 2022 and saw an increase in revenue during that time.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the Lab’s proven business case, this pilot will be extended to 100 businesses receiving IOM grant-funded loans from Vitas Iraq for KESK solar products over a one-year period. By providing financial support to micro-, small and medium-sized enterprise business owners to access affordable power, this program will:·        \n\nCreate public awareness and promote the use of renewable energy in Iraq;\nRespond to the need for solar products among businesses and their demand for financing;\nEncourage wider adoption of solar products, which will reduce gas emissions that contribute to climate change and reduce stress on Iraq’s national power grid; and\nContribute to job creation through the sale, distribution, installation and servicing of solar energy products.\nVitas has always worked to develop new products and services to serve the community and to provide the best products in the market. These loans support Iraqi businesses through offering installment plans rather than having to pay the full amount up front.”\nMohammed Jawad, Marketing and Public Relations Manager for Vitas Iraq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVitas Iraq is launching the pilot this spring with funding from IOM to help other business owners have access to reliable power.
