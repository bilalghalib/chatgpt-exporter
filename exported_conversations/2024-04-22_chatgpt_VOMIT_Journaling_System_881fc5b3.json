      "content": "can you make a summarized bulletted list of the main points in this video transcription? let's talk about journaling and vomitthis is a picture of me at 18 here's meat 25 and here's me now now these threeguys they don't have a ton in common butthere is one thing this druggy littleteenager this quarter lifee crisis dudewho's losing his hair and this soberhappy Suburban Dad they all Journaljournaling is one of those things thatmassively changed my life but there is aproblem with it there is a lot of hypebut there isn't that much instructionthe general message is journal and itwill change your life and so you sitdown at a blank page and uh now whatshould I start with dear diary do I talkabout my day do I talk about mychildhood am I allowed to use this for ashopping list what are the rules ifyou've ever wondered why journalingisn't doing that life-changing thingthat it's meant to or even if you lovejournaling and you're looking to love itmore then I made this video for you butfirst I should probably explain thetitle The vomitsystem to me journaling is vomiting soyou know when you're really really sickmaybe you got windy roads maybe you gotplasted last night I don't know forwhatever reason you're just not feelinggood and then you vomit and you kind ofdo feel good in the moment vomiting ispretty gross but just after you're likeoh I feel better I think that was what Ineeded now I've journaled for 15 yearswhich means I've tried hundreds oftechniques some are great others notgreat but the good stuff stays with youand in this video I want to take youthrough that good stuff my all-timefavorite journaling techniques and thesystem that I think about them in thevomit system all right let's doit so what is this that's probably thequestion that you got right now whatthis is is the five main reasons that Ijournal the five things that I usejournaling for one reason starts with vanother reason starts with o then M ThenI then T and the entire topic startswith j so if you're playing along withthe alphabet superet this video is J nowlet's talk about vomit I feel like I'mgoing to keep saying that firstreason a journal to vent I've also madethis the first reason because this ishow I started journaling and it's how Istart a lot of journaling sessions I'llshow you what I mean vent write whatmakes you angry this is a quote from thewriter po Bronson who said whenever hehas writers block he just thinks ofsomething that you know makes him madand it's not that he's trying to write arant it's just that rants come prettyeasy you know it just rolls right out ofhere I start with whatever makes meangry and that usually gets me over thathurdle of starting now as much asventing is a tool to get us into theflow it does have some practicalbenefits one of the big ones is the Minddump effect socome on red so before journaling I kindof see my mind like that[Music]afterwards it's like that it's thisindexing effect things are chaotic uphere things are not chaotic up herethere's this quote that I like I don'tknow what I think until I write itapparently Jan didan and like 30 otherpeople said that it's one of those oneswhere there's like a think piece onwhere did this qu originate butregardless of its origin I really likeits meaning cuz basically what we'retrying to do is get all of this mess andput it on paper and paper it's finiteit's trivial it's clean we can sort ofsee what's going on the thing that Iliking it to is looking for your keys ifyou were looking for your keys in a darkroom probably wouldn't find them soon asyou turn on the light you're like boomgot them this is when the lights are offI have no idea what's going on up herethis is when the lights are on and I'mlike oh there's that nasty thoughtthere's that cognitive distortion maybeI'm not a trainwreck and that is vent the first thingthat I like to journal for now now wehaveoh obligations yeah specifically to makesure our obligations aren't just Rogueintrusive thoughts that just bug usthroughout the day and also to get themdone this step is similar to venting inthe sense that we are mind dumping butthe big difference is we are not justmind dumping our thoughts but ourresponsibilities our to-do list we'rejust trying to I'm going to say it againvomit it onto the page the idea here isthat we don't want to use our brain tostore problems that was smooth we wantto use it to to solve problems and inorder to free out that space we want toput all of our problems onto the journalalso if you want to explore just how faryou can take this indexing idea justtaking your thoughts and putting themsomewhere else check out Thiago Forte'sconcept of the second brain superfascinating stuff all right let's getinto actionables when I am usingjournaling for obligations what I do isthese four things so firstly I'll startwith an obligation dump this is whereit's like anything that could remotelybe considered an obleverything from I need to write thischapter I need to get this filmdeveloped I need to clean the kitchen Ineed to write back to this email I needto update my license I want to buy aboat everything everything from theMonday into the grandio just get it allon the page next I organize it I drawsome buckets here that's fun in terms ofactual buckets I usually just split thisup into like broad categories you knowlike family Finance Health work now weget to step threeprioritize I've drawn a boat here youprobably know the story it's this UKrowing team that won Gold one year andwhen the coach was asked what the secretformula was he said I just gave them allone guiding question doesn't make theboat go faster do you want to eatbroccoli or a cake what a crossroadsright what a normal decision but forexample sake I'll roll with it broccolior cake which one are you going to eatfor breakfast buddy instead of having tomul over all of the pros and cons theteam would just encouraged to ask onequestion will it make the boat go fastertherefore pick the broccoli sorry Kakeso in terms of journaling and organizingall of these obligations and the to-dolist I usually run up past a guidingquestion there's a decent Tim Ferrisquestion that I like for this it's whichthing on this list if done would makeeverything else easier and that usuallyraises the correct obligations to thetop and then finally I put it into ato-do list form that's what I got righthere so bare minimum and killing it thisis how I truncate my to-do lists I writeout the bare minimum that I need to dothat day what is the least amount ofthings that I need to do in order tomake tomorrow suck a little less andthen if I'm really in the mood whatcould I get done I've used this splitsystem for years and what I really likelack is it minimizes the guilt that youmight place on yourself if you don't getenough stuff done it creates momentumcuz the bars set low so you do achievestuff and it accounts for the normal esand flows of Life some days are reallyreally hard and on those days it isreally nice to know what the bareminimum that you have to dois and that bringsus to M the next thing that I like touse journaling for what could thisbe I use journaling for my mindset huhdo you like this guy this is meant to bea brain and it's training to get abetter mindset I promise this is goingsomewhere so I like to understandmindset in two ways the first way iswith a tech metaphor your mindset islike the operating system that yourcomputer runs and the second issomething that you can train hence theSW brain but training your mindset isone of those phrases that just doesn'tsound like it's going to lead anywhereyou know super vague man it's like whatdo you do with that what's the actionthat you take and this is where journalcomes in here I've got six journalingtechniques that I will use from time totime to improve my mindset and from 15years of journaling I'd say that theseare probably my favorites all right sothe first one reframing I've talkedabout this so much but my favoritejournaling question is how is this thebest thing that has ever happened to meand I've asked that about some deeplydeeply painful things and it feels soinappropriate but the thing about yourbrain is it just starts looking foranswers when you ask that question it'slike could be this could be this couldbe this it's wrong every time but startsbreaking your thinking and it helpstrain your mindset to just naturallyrefrain stuff next one possibility ifyou are struggling with like limitingbeliefs or just doubting yourself mightbe worth checking out because statementswhat's a because statement Mr Boldman Iwill tell you don't worry I got this abecause statement is a way that wegather evidence that we are whatever thething that we say we want to be is cuzit's not like you can yell affirmationsat yourself and just have your identitychange if for example you're trying tobe healthier you can't just yell on aMir I am healthy I am healthy I amhealthy I mean you probably could dothat maybe you'd get a sweat butultimately it's probably not going to bethat effective instead we want to builda tangible Bank of evidence that we'rehealthy so you write the identitystatement the one that you might want toyell in the mirror I am healthy then youwrite because and then at the end of theday you find a few reasons that actuallyvalidate this from yourday now this works on three levelsfirstly it's positive cuz you do startto actually piece together the evidenceand that's the thing that will causechange and actually creates newpossibilities secondly I found that thiswill make me create evidence you know ifI'm like I am sober because if I want tofinish that sentence I got to stay soberand then thirdly it can actually be ahalf decent reality check so if I'm likeI am 6'4 because I'm not 6'4 I I it'sjust not going to happen the nextjournaling technique that I use to trainmy mindset is inversion for me what thisis about is practicing a reaction that Iwant to have to problems in my everydaylife and that reaction is to look at thesolution but also look at what theopposite of the solution is but why whydo I want that reaction well the reasonthat I want this is because I find thatit makes the solution to things reallyreally obvious to the point where notdoing them looks quite dumb an examplewould be let's say I want to draw moreit's a bit of an open-ended problem tosolve but with the inversion you sort ofget a better Direction so while askinghow can I draw more we're also askinghow can I draw less to draw less I couldleave my books where I can't see them Icould put my pencils in the cupboards sothere's more friction and I can spendany window of time that I have on myphoneimmediately I realize what I'm doingwrong which I find gets me to the answerof what to do right a lot faster in ajournaling prompt context this is justabout taking whatever question it isthat you're asking and asking theopposite next technique for mindsettraining is perspective M this is fun soyou know that whole phenomenon thatother people's problems are easier tosolve than your own like you know whenyour friend has this conundrum andthey're like what do I do what do I doand everyone's like obviously you dothis you just do this man but they stilldeliberate and it's not as clear as itis to everybody else and it makes senseobviously you know they're the ones whoactually have to live it they're theones with all the Nuance whereas thepeople giving the advice have the luxuryof not getting caught in the details andperspective and that is what we canpractice giving ourselves perspective sothe journaling prompt here is if youwere a friend who was giving you adviceon this situation right now and youreally really wanted you to succeed whatadvice would you give we are practicinglooking outside ourselves in order tohelpourselves next up we have disciplinethis is a bit of a meta tool cuz it'sit's not about a journaling prompt butjust the entire action of journaling sojust like with because statementsdiscipline is something that isevidence-based you know you have tobuild that up in order to believeyourself that you actually aredisciplined it's one of those thingsthat you got to practice when thingsaren't easy as well but man this reallyreally helped me out a lot I made a fullvideo on this experiment that I didwhere in every time I went to look atsocial media I switched the placement ofthe apps so then my muscle memory justnaturally opened the notes app and thenI was like well I'm here guess I got ajournal and it was really cool cuzswitching from something that pacifiesyour brain to something that gets you toactively reflect on what your brain'sdoing it just fastracks this entireprocess and yeah massively gladed up todiscipline all right final mindset thingthat we can use journaling to practicethe one that everybody knows gratitudeeasy prompt what are three things thatyou're grateful for today if you want tospice it up you can add a bonus promptmake the first thing you're grateful forsomething mundane make the second thingsomething that happened by chance andfor your third thing L something thatyou made happen write them down andwhat's your brain getSW all right vomi that's where up to thenext thing that I use journaling for Iuse journaling toideate the skill of having ideas is oneof those things where I don't knowthere's so much messaging about it beinginnate and if you don't have it youcan't do it it's just not true you canabsolutely work on having ideas you canbuild that muscle up strong man andjournaling I think is a really greatenvironment to do this so let's sayyouve got a problem that you're tryingto solve maybe it's a big problem likewhere do I want to live live or acreative problem like what should I drawtoday or even a problem of what do Iwant to do on the weekend whatever it isand there's always something what I liketo do is put on a timer for 5 minutesand then challenge myself to come upwith 30 answers before the timer goesoff you know that phrase if you want akitten ask for a horse this is like thecognitive version of that if I want onesolution I've got to come up with 30 andusually I find it's like the 14th ideathat I go with but yeah one thing that Ifind really important is just don't editthe list until it's over it's a quantitygamethe second technique that I like to useto ideate is how would blank solve theproblem that could be anybody I learnedthis when I worked in advertising myfirst year I was working for thisamazing creative director and every timewe get a brief he'd say things like whatwould Nike do how would Red Bull solvethis problem and every single time itwould just break out thinking in thebest way possible you can substitutethis with anything sort of the basis ofwhat would Jesus do Iguess and then the third technique forideating that I like using is open theloop we like closing the loop well ourbrains do I guess our brains love toclose the question Loop if a question isposed our brains want to answer them howmany regular sized Ducks could you fitin a k Carnival I've just opened a loopit's a question out of nowhere but itstill opens a loop in your brain yourbrain's just naturally going to the sizeof a dark and then the volume of aminivan and it is just Keen to get tothe answer it wants the resolve and wecan use this so much in our journalingif there's a question that's on yourmind ask the question just write it downand your brain will naturally try toclose the loop this technique I findreally good when I'm really strugglingwith a problem and the way that I do itis I'll write down the question justbefore I go to bed then I go to sleepand then hopefully wake up and I try toanswer it and for me at least it worksmore often than it doesn't close theloop speaking of closing theloop it's time for our final letter inthe vomit systemT trajectory yeah I use journaling toget a good sense of my trajectory andalso to tweak it as I go all right lastletter let's have a little look so Isplit trajectory up into d Direction andday to-day what I've got here is twodifferent journaling techniques one'sfor the macro one's for the microDirection this is a pretty well-knownprompt but here's how it goes so to makesure that we are on the right directionwe have our goal up here let's say it'sa financial one I want to save 1,000bucks then you look at the day thatyou've just had or the week that you'vejust had whatever the time period is andyou ask whether you're moving away fromthat goal or towards that goal to answerthis you compile evidence so evidencefor away could be like oh I got UberEats that wasn't wise evidence fortowards could be but I canceled likeeight subscription that I've forgottenabout or I resisted the urge to impulsebuy whatever it is then you just adjustaccordingly so if you're moving away yousort of tweak that behavior if you'removing towards just keep it up orderuats delete the uat tab you can put yoursave money into savings you can writedown what you learned so it helps you inthe future if you're doing good doubledown and then our final journalingtechnique for today is about getting thedaytoday hidden metrics a hidden metricall right so we got visible metricsthings like money then we got hiddenmetrics things like happinessfulfillment peace of mind and theproblem when these are hidden is theycan get ignored and this can lead to allsorts of misery pretty quick like peoplechoosing to work a little longer insteadof spending time with their kids is thedollar we can count but the quality ofthe relationship we can't but justbecause the metric is hidden doesn'tmean that it is any less important butwhat helps with these hidden metrics ismaking them visible and this is wherejournaling comes back in and actuallystarts creating change these threequestions it's one of my favoritejournaling prompts but basically at theend of every day you ask yourself thesethree question questions what excited metoday what drained me of energy and whatdid I learn if you do this for 30 daysyou'll get seriously good daa onyourself honestly you'll see thepatterns by like 5 days and you'll belike all right I get the idea I got todo some[Music]stuff and this concludes the vomitsystem yeah thank you very much forwatching I hope you enjoyed that also ifanybody has any cool journaling promptsChuck them in the comments because Ireally like collecting them I just Ithink they're fun but yeah hope youenjoyed the video hope you have abeautiful day and uh vomit catch you\n",
