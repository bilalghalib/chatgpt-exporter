For instance, the Green Climate Fund [www.greenclimate.fund] supports projects that reduce emissions, and they’re active in Iraq.”\nAdd: “You’ve already identified green actions in your Business Efficiency Workbook, like installing solar panels. This section lets you showcase those in your plan.”\nDiscussion (1.5 minutes):\nSay: “Let’s discuss: How could a green focus give your business an edge? Could it save money, tap into new markets, or align with your values?”\nPrompt with examples: “A restaurant using local produce might reduce transport costs and appeal to eco-conscious customers. A tech startup could use energy-efficient servers to cut electricity bills.”\nEncourage sharing: “Anyone already doing something green? How does it help your business?”\nHandout and Workbook Link (1 minute):\nSay: “To explore this further, use the ‘Green Ideas Brainstorm’ handout. It’s based on the Green Business Booklet (p. 12) and asks questions like ‘What environmental problems exist in your community?’ and ‘What resources could you use?’ You can skip this if it doesn’t fit your business.”\nAdd: “Also, check your Business Efficiency Workbook’s ‘Checklist’—you’ve likely noted challenges like waste or energy use. Use those to inform this section of your plan.”\nWrap-Up and Transition (30 seconds):\nSay: “A green focus can differentiate your business and attract support.
