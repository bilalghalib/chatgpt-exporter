I recorded this video walking through the challenges and opportunities we explored together with some additional resources I researched for you right after our call. Enjoy, this video should be helpful for you and also for everyone that wasn't able to join. \n \nFor those curious to read up on some of the pitfalls and ethical concerns of generative AI, you can check out this HBR article. Also, here's a link to the RAFT framework we will be exploring in the second half of our day tomororw. There are many frameworks and laws being drafted currently, as this is a living debate and discussion. I'm excited to explore it with you tomorrow.\n \nReminder, that tomorrow is our last day, and again we will meet on the main Bloom zoom room here:\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/87609457023?pwd=T1pKTnBxbTRlOGx5YzQwTy9OcGI4UT09\n\n",

After our call, I created this video that provides an in-depth walkthrough of the challenges and opportunities we've discovered together, supplemented by additional resources that I've personally researched. This video should prove useful not only for you but also for those who couldn't join us today.\n\nFor those interested in delving deeper into the pitfalls and ethical considerations of generative AI, I recommend checking out this article from Harvard Business Review. We're also going to explore the RAFT framework during the second half of our session tomorrow. There's a vibrant ongoing debate around various frameworks and laws being drafted in this field, and I'm eager to dive into it with you tomorrow.\n\nAs a reminder, tomorrow marks our final day.
