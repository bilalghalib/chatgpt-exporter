            "extracted_content": "00:00:00 SPK_1 Is it going to be in Iraq, right? 00:00:02 Bilal Ghalib In Iraq, starting with\nMosul only, oh now let me tell you, umm maybe he can share the screen, wait, let me find a\nhouse. Aaah, what house? Let me just find it. A bit project proposal. 00:00:27 Bilal Ghalib\nOkay, good, now I will share the screen, I mean something quick, so you know a little bit of\nthe umm I share? This whole screen. Okay, so it&#39;s a project, one I share, this is a good four-\nyear project, the aa the aa it&#39;s 20,000,000,000 euros, and whoever is going to do it is on\numm four aa. First of all, 00:01:04 Bilal Ghalib is the a part of the name. It will work added\npolicies of labor standards. Result two increased green and affordable housing and decent\nemployment result three improve the business environment of the ITC will work on it and\nparticipation of local businesses and investors. In. The construction sector result for is\nstrengthened. Influence of labor markets on employers and workers organizations and the\nsocial dialogue. With the government But in short, let&#39;s see if this 00:01:40 Bilal Ghalib Can\nsomeone explain it? Easier? Easier? Easier, what will happen with this project is that it will\nbe um um encouragement for um let&#39;s explain it to you, but in everyone&#39;s talk they call it?\nMosul was destroyed um by the wars that happened and the number of um housing places\nis small so rent has become very expensive for people, one of the um called this project, they\nwant not only to build new houses, but they want these new houses to have them have them\nhave things, among, sustainability even not just meaning we build anew, but like we used to\nbuild anew but better and one of the first parts of this um. The whole project is sorry, I\nmean I was raised in America, so if my Arabic is weak, tell me hahaha 00:02:43\nSPK_1Masha&#39;Allah. 00:02:44 Bilal GhalibHahaha, yes, I mean I&#39;m excellent, they told me. I\nmean I grew up in America my whole life. Okay, sometimes there&#39;s a possibility that we\nhave to go get English and come back, God willing. 00:02:54 SPK_1It&#39;s okay. Take your time.\n00:02:56 Bilal GhalibOk, good, yes, yes, yes, the result is that they don&#39;t just want to build\nnew houses, and increase the number of apartments and houses, but in the market, they\nwant, I mean, these houses to have them from the beginning, from the beginning, and they\nwant companies in Umm in Erbil and in Iraq in Mosul, so they are the ones who will put the\npayment on it. We look for companies like Sika, who have the same theory on the. They\nmight be part of this, the one in which I mean. I may not know the whole project, I know\nthat they will build two hundred model homes. I mean, there will be houses, people will see\nthem and say, “Wow, what a cool roof this is,” and “Wow, what a solar system is,” etc. They\nwill build these model homes. This is part of the project, but the part that I am responsible\nfor is education and training. So how do we encourage and support the people who want to?\n00:04:12 Bilal Ghalib Companies use these. How do we encourage and support people who\nwant to? They may establish a new company and say, “Here I can use this method from\nsolar,” or one of these things. So I try to create a curriculum and I try to link it, and with the\ncompanies in Iraq that work in this field. Even people say, “Here I can bear this from Sika so\n\nTranslated from Arabic to English - www.onlinedoctranslator.com\n\nthat I can build Hetchi, Hetchi Hetchi,” so they think, “Yes.” And what they are working on\nnow is the magazines. As soon as they come, we will do it like this.Even one knows the\nwhole house, where is the ha, can we work on the ha, on the energy, on the new ha?\n00:05:06 Bilal Ghalib And then I thought that we would make one, I mean on the wa. And\nthen one that I want to learn from you about the insulator and so on in the same place, I\nwanted to enter it, I expect that they work together, oh, these things, I mean the wa. The\nfourth one is the same, it will be that it and everything that we learned 00:05:37 Bilal Ghalib\nWhat is the future? What are the houses of the future? What will they look like? So this is it,\nand I don&#39;t know if ideas come to your mind, if you say this, I mean, and I saw Sika at her\nplace. And I entered it. And. Aa, I mean, she went and saw things. And God willing, I will get\nfrom her, how much information to put in the program, but I don&#39;t know the idea. And\nwhere do I want to work? But I don&#39;t know if you have any ideas, questions, or anything.\n00:06:14 SPK_1 Sure, by God, there are a lot of questions and so on. We&#39;ll keep talking about\nthis topic, maybe more than once to get the point across. The idea is clearer for both parties,\nbut first, was your communication with Sika? Did it come from a specific person? 00:06:37\nBilal Ghalib Because someone named Mustafa gave me the person&#39;s phone number. Let me\njust make sure. Sik, wait a minute. Aha, aha. Someone. Hasn&#39;t Khattab Al-Shawi heard of\nhim? 00:06:59 SPK_1 Khattab. 00:07:00 Bilal Ghalib Al-Shawi, so I called Khattab umm once,\ntwice, and so on. Who. Who. Mustafa. He said that he had contact with Sika, and there was a\npossibility of cooperation between us, but I didn’t hear from the letter, so I said I’ll try it\nhahaha and see if it’s okay hahaha so so thank God, we had a call together, but oh well, what\nare you going to call on, but it was from ITC and there was supposed to be a relationship\nbuilt beforehand. 00:07:37 SPK_1 Nice, excellent, okay, I’m happy, frankly, with this call, and\nI’m happy that we have, oh yes, a fingerprint, let’s say in this field, because we are in, oh yes,\nSika in general, you know, they are committed to. And all these details, and by virtue of the\nfact that Sika. Exists, it recognizes Switzerland, like the ones they have. In us, in every\ncountry or in almost all countries in the world, there are countries that exist, including Iraq,\nokay, so I mean. 00:08:19 SPK_1 And they exist everywhere, and. I mean, this is one of the\nthings that is also very important, yes, I mean, for example, there could be the opposite of\ninternational companies that are present in Iraq, but. Or they have, for example. But they\nbuy the materials from abroad, right? The cup that is in Sika, I mean, and this will take me a\nlittle bit further, that we. 00:08:52 SPK_1 I mean, the place that I&#39;m talking to you from now\nis in Erbil in. In. I mean, a factory in Erbil, in the southern Thimar industrial area, and\nbehind me is the lab, I mean, right in the local produce. Ah, raw materials that&#39;s great, does\nthis help? Exactly, so I mean. Does anyone bring materials from abroad? 00:09:24 SPK_1 A\nkilometer, for example? So, I mean, this is the first aspect, the other aspect that we are\ninterested in is that we also have annually. And. So, we always strive to find new ideas, so\nthat we have a fingerprint on this topic, and. Back for our community. I mean, praise be to\nGod, it came at the right time, because last year, for example, we had an orphanage, for\nexample, okay, this year we wanted to have something a little different, we contacted a\nhospital, 00:10:10 SPK_1 for cancer, okay for children, and we tried to see with them, if they\nneeded anything in terms of providing what they have, okay, so...I contacted the hospital\ndirector and visited him, and we are still waiting for news from them. I mean, what I want to\n\ntell you is that, God willing, it really is. 00:10:45 SPK_1With regard to what we offer. In all,\nalmost all products, and there were certain highlights. On the subject of sustainability, I will\ngive you one example, for example, in concrete, okay, we have. Re-add concrete mix water.\n00:11:16 SPK_1With the addmixer, okay, in Desolens now. Is it possible to find it in the\nmarket? I mean. In this field. And you might find something. 00:11:34 SPK_1We have a rag\nof products. I mean, okay, so it is possible, for example, to find something specific that is\nsuitable for the ah for the bag that we have, so when we say, for example, that we and it\nwas? By? For example? 00:11:58 SPK_1So you reduce the. I mean. So that it serves the one\nyou have. We will need to understand more from you. 00:12:16 SPK_1The model for these\nbuildings that we will work on, for example, but you said that this is not exactly what you\nhave in your program, but you have more education and training, right? 00:12:34 Bilal\nGhalib The one, I mean, is part of my project. I want to focus on training and education, yes,\nand the money, I mean? Those who can benefit with what they are. As for the houses, they\nwant to focus more on the from, so if this benefits the how one can see the houses and the\nneeds and. We can reduce the the. 00:13:10 Bilal Ghalib From the roof, I mean, it is\npermissible to have a. If it is from these things, then it is permissible? This can direct\nthinking a little bit about. 00:13:23 SPK_1Even maybe one of the things we also face is\nsupporting the okay sometimes, you have the weak, so one of the solutions might be to not\nmerge, and then but we also had, I mean. Artistic. F. A. 00:13:48 Bilal GhalibNice, yes, this is\ndefinitely one of the likes. Hahaha. The whole building. Hahaha. 00:14:00 SPK_1And by the\nway, we have, I mean. We did it two years ago in Mosul, there is a mosque there that was\nexposed. To demolition, I mean it was affected by the war, I mean, and the bombing that\nhappened, so we worked on it and did for it. F. So? 00:14:25 SPK_1somehow we tried to\nreturn the shape that it was in, I mean the mosque. 00:14:32 Bilal GhalibOne of the things\nthat, in terms of my training and thinking, I try to focus on, I noticed that the. Hobby\nsometimes has a hobby that became one of the hot walls from the way they do it on the roof,\nand one of the problems is the destruction, the heritage and the new construction, because\nmodern construction is normal, I mean it came from the West and they imitate, and the\nwindows are big. Traditional concrete, cinder blocks, and it reaches like an oven. So one of\nthe things that I try to focus on in training is how we can learn from the past so that we can\nbuild for the future, it doesn&#39;t have to be that big walls, but there is a possibility that the\nwalls will have the same ones, so they can use suitable materials, or things like that, I mean\n00:15:29 SPK_1 Yes, 100% 00:15:33 Bilal Ghalib Even people are proud of their history and\nthe not saying that all the solutions come from abroad, Sistani is not from the ideas of the\nArabs or Muslims, it is something that came from the Yuan, I don&#39;t know what? No, this\nmeans, this is ours. And we are going back, but we want to take the best of the best from\nhistory so that we can build a better future. I mean, we just need to develop. Money, money,\neducation, God willing. 00:16:04 SPK_1 Okay, a question, Abu Bilal, if you please, I mean, if\nyou allow me, what about education and training? Do you think that who will benefit from\neducation and training? Yes? 00:16:18 Bilal Ghalib And this will come on ice, there is a\npossibility that we work together on it if you want to cooperate with them, one of the\ntargeted people, if you see that list of them. They want not only to solve the problem with\nthe and bring. Houses that are sustainable ILOA perspective and not the ITC. Theirs is.\n\n00:16:50 Bilal Ghalib Things that I love today, theirs and the houses and. What is this thing\nthat the party that I work on, the idea of ​​them? that they are actually working on, the\nsustainable solutions sustainability of the solutions. Certainly a very important part of the\nproject, but the way to both of them is not that he supports and these build a house to use\nthese things, because we want to develop science with young men and women, and we\nencourage the 00:17:30 Bilal Ghalib and we encourage the. So, is it permissible for\ngraduates of the Faculty of Architecture to graduates of the Faculty of Environmental\nEngineering you. Choose people who want, meaning they are allowed. But they just want.\n00:18:02 Bilal Ghalib This program is something special for young men and women. I mean,\ndo they focus on them? 00:18:10 SPK_1 So, what do you mean? Well, if we think about the\nplace or platform in which we can do this type of training, then you have certain ideas in\nmind. 00:18:29 Bilal Ghalib I mean. From the work of my parts, one of them is that. The\nsecond. Partners in Egypt I am looking for people like Qaf Labs or like Mosul Space or other\nplaces who can do the and one of the things that if I try to explain is that they want people, I\nmean like I told you, 00:19:00 Bilal Ghalib there are two different pathways if you want to\nthink about them, one is people who come in and learn, I mean the techniques of the or the\nor the green roofing, or the or the houses, I mean but then after that I want to find people\nwho can give them the that there is a solar power plant in Mosul, so it won’t be a day, or\ntwo, for even one person to learn, all he needs to be able to do is a longer hobby course, and\nM. What is his name, Mohammed, from Mosul? He says that he is one of the people who take\ntheir course, I expect there is. 00:19:45 Bilal Ghalib in this field, so what did he say about\nthat? Training, the training that I see that I&#39;m working on is short training that clarifies the\nsubject, and then I want to distribute people and say to them, do you want to develop the\nsolution? Go to Musa Solar, they have a three-way course, if they go to Kask and do an\ninternship with another company in Erbil, then I&#39;m looking for that. I&#39;m looking for Ambots,\nlet&#39;s say I don&#39;t know if. If Sika has. Roofing. Installation on, the job training low internship,\nthey go through my short training, yeah. And then if they want to develop, they do the two-\nweek and four-week ones. I want to look for it&#39;s like identifying the people and the\nbeginning. 00:20:43 Bilal GhalibAnd then also. If. Entrepreneurship, the people who want\nand saw, saw a solution and want to develop the company, they go to. These are the three\nparts of the 00:21:01 SPK_1 and how do you reach these people or will they reach you?\n00:21:07 Bilal Ghalib We, thank God, these people we found in Mosul have a commitment\nand a lot of work with the college, and with the supervisor and with the. F because they are.\nThey have been working in Mosul since 2014, and they have. And the same thing. And oh,\nthe fear of the next. We haven’t chosen one for the next yet, I mean. 00:21:46 Bilal Ghalib\nThings that I don&#39;t know everything about, because I don&#39;t have a hobby to communicate\nwith them, that there are relationships from it, and with the government, they work on it,\nyoung men and women with me, even work with technical A and the stickers and things like\nthat in. Things, but we have during the a. a. k to the community. 00:22:18 SPK_1 Ok good,\nokay let me also give you some information that in addition to the factory that we have, we\nalso have. It is in the same location that we are in. And. I mean. 00:22:40 SPK_1 we mean.\nWhat comes to us from the okay and the ones in the market in. Ok so yeah so what I want to\ntell you is that we mean. We give the. 00:23:05 SPK_1 to the people and we also mean. So it&#39;s\n\na small, medium size, so we can display it. And. Or? 00:23:29 SPK_1And then when we finish\nthe. We do practical training ok so they can they can feel they can try materials or they can\nplay around. Ok we can do something for this kind of things that could be really. 00:23:50\nBilal GhalibBy the way. It. Money? I was going to try to link it with Sika if it&#39;s possible?\n00:24:06 Bilal Ghalibthree it, it can be with you, I mean they can come to Sika, and not just\nread, I mean they see and I mean they can commit. Aaa? With the youth? 00:24:25 SPK_1The\npossibility is there for us and. It is there, I mean it needs coordination, the one that I want to\nfocus on is what do we have experience in? The beginning of the things related to concrete, I\nmean because as you know concrete is. 00:24:55 SPK_1So on this topic it is. The materials. It\nwas like one of the things. To train.00:25:15 SPK_1Young. People I mean? How to produce\nconcrete. In the most efficient to list.00:25:30 SPK_1We can, for example, explain to them.\nEspecially corruption, okay, the external facades and the roofs, the soul, we have corruption\nand the roof. And also the subject of reinforcement, as we mentioned, if we have, for\nexample, ah. Like mosques or something, houses that were affected by wars, so they were\ndestroyed, Adam for.00:26:07 SPK_1This is one of the things we work on, and also of course\nthe A and its children, and many things, I mean.00:26:27 Bilal Ghalib How does it work? I\nmean? I mean, do you see things from Sika about the? And the, I mean, the, and then the, and\nthen the, the nice sandwich on the roof, but corruption, how does it work? Money? Money\ncorruption? And if you say that like I told you, we are trying to focus now on retro in more\nthan one new thing, and I want to see if there is a way we can work on corruption. 00:26:58\nSPK_1 Of course, with corruption, you have the and you have, I mean, in this topic, but let&#39;s\nfocus on the things that have become moderate. I mean, do you have materials that are\ngoing to be, I mean, what do we call them? The idea is to reduce the. On the okay, so in the\nnormal situation, you only have block and or? 00:27:42 SPK_1 So. The idea is that. 00:27:51\nSPK_3 But this will be, I mean. 00:27:55 Bilal Ghalib I mean, and then? If it will be the same.\n00:28:03 SPK_1 The same same entire interface, I mean. I mean. More than one product, if\nwe say the simplest of them, the simplest of them, will be about. But this interface it has a\nvery low. Connectivity for heat. 00:28:33 SPK_1As, as, as. Much. These are the things that\nreduce. By, and if we go to more complex solutions, it will definitely be about you adding\nsomething additional, I mean. 00:28:50 SPK_3Like the mashrabiyas, the front, and I don&#39;t\nknow what else? 00:28:56 Bilal GhalibSweet, good? 00:28:57 SPK_1Of course, let&#39;s not\nforget also, just on the subject of corruption. The joints, i.e. present in the surface or. In the\ncorruption.Because this is the weakest point in the building, I mean no matter how much we\ndo, this is technology and it means the best thing in the world, in the end you have a\nvacuum. 00:29:24 SPK_1 It will directly enter, I mean, oh, what is this? in a good way?\nUnfortunately, materials are used that dry out over time and shrink, so. You. Fill it with a\ncertain materials good for six months After six months, it&#39;s shrinking you have, the same\nissue. 00:29:56 SPK_1 Is, there are so. Certain materials, so that. 00:30:06 SPK_3 I mean.\nNew, where do you expect this to be the biggest? In Iraq in general. 00:30:17 Bilal Ghalib I\nmean, what do you see? If there is something else? Do you expect it? 00:30:28 SPK_1\nDefinitely with corruption and the roof, I mean, these two with corruption and the roof and\nalso with water proofing, I mean also. Really. Yes the waterproofing we could do something\nbut if we came to arrange them. 00:30:47 Bilal Ghalib In the heat, they don&#39;t think about\n\nwater, why do you expect it to be important in Iraq? 00:30:54 SPK_1 exists unfortunately, I\nmean it exists. I mean it exists, I mean a lesson, we are of course talking about Iraq, we are\nnot talking about only a specific region because it varies from region to region. Water table,\nokay, so if you have a building and in this place you have? Is it exposed to taking water from\nthe ground right? With the passage of time, it means it will be destroyed, I mean it will not\nbe able to withstand the water, so 00:31:35 SPK_1 came injection. Existing structure, so that\nit does not absorb the water present in the soil. 00:31:51 SPK_3 means it does not have to\nbe built again if. Nothing means. Encourage, that people focus on corruption, so its meaning.\n00:32:05 Bilal Ghalib The surface, the surface, the. I mean, not the the the the the roofs?\n00:32:15 SPK_3 Oh, is there any analysis with Iraq in general? Good quality roofs means\nproblems. On. 00:32:36 Bilal Ghalib Anything I want to see where the problem even comes\nfrom? To be able to present it to the people, let&#39;s say we told them that. I don&#39;t know what\nthat means? 00:32:50 SPK_3 How do they use our episode? And if you give them this roof? It\nstarts to get all inflammatory and encourages people, I mean maybe. First of all, business.\nRemove. 00:33:11 SPK_3 Problems I mean, not problems I mean, like Iraq? 00:33:25 SPK_1\nOkay, we are the ones who I can tell you from our experience over the years yes, that at this\ntime of the year now in the summer yes, and before winter comes upon us before the rainy\nseason, you find all the people and social media there is confusion and commotion on the\nsubject. Roof insulation because it is a house of course because of the people. Materials are\nused. Unfortunately, materials are used that chip. 00:34:03 SPK_1Can only last for a year or\ntwo maximum. So you find that the same people. The same people come back and request\nthe same materials after a year or two, because they were affected by the, I mean, these\nmaterials, unfortunately, they use. I mean, do they break down after a while? 00:34:31\nSPK_1And I can tell you that, unfortunately, most projects do not use. Proper uh roofing\nmaterials, I mean, we can say. More than seventy percent of the construction of the new\nbuildings they never use proper insulation materials, so you find, for example, after a year\nor two, problems start to appear. And follow up. 00:35:11 SPK_1Is it from? 00:35:12 Bilal\nGhalibIs it from the, I mean, the roof. 00:35:15 SPK_3If it is. I mean. Proper insulation\nmaterials, I mean. The corrugated cardboard.00:35:32 SPK_3But the fact is that most of\nthe.00:35:36 Bilal Ghalibhouses don&#39;t have.00:35:41 SPK_1Fine i&#39;m quoting.00:35:43 Bilal\nGhalibOk actually interesting, and then this is the same problem that it wants.00:35:48\nSPK_3You say every year, please, it is necessary. Your imagination ideal structure.I mean an\naverage? Everything is expensive, so it has a shortcoming, right? 00:36:12 Bilal Ghalib In\nyour imagination, if only with the materials and designs you know, the basics. You would\nsuggest. 00:36:24 SPK_1 Of course, yes yes, we have it. By the way, in the market that we\nhave. One, let&#39;s say this and one. As for the. 00:36:44 SPK_1 If a house, let&#39;s say. It could cost\naround $500 to $1000, that&#39;s the. The process, but the difference is that these are the\nmaterials. Okay. Whereas. 00:37:12 SPK_1 dollars, but it means every one or two years.\n00:37:19 SPK_3 There is someone who does the equation. By the possibilities of generators.\n00:37:25 Bilal Ghalib And by the heat, he studied the temperature of the house. I mean,\nactual cost savings in Hawaii, sometimes the poor, okay, in general, I grew up in America, I\nalways see that the poor remain poor, 00:37:36 SPK_3 because their life is expensive\nbecause they take, I mean, its name. I mean, they buy bad food, so they have the same thing,\n\nsometimes people, I mean, do you expect them to save? From 400 to 56 in a house, they\nsave on a hundred, but then they lose B. 00:37:55 Bilal Ghalib I mean, the thing is a\nsubscription from the generator, or oh, I mean, we don&#39;t know, I mean? But you have these\naccounts, I mean, let&#39;s say there&#39;s a possibility that the most expensive. 00:38:09 SPK_3 is, I\nmean, the thing that saves the most because it might take five years for someone who\nworks, to four to five. Accounts, and I expect these things for me, I want them, I put them in\nthe training, because I want that we are a business, I mean, the. I mean, they want. They do.\nThese are accounts that. 00:38:41 SPK_3They must make the. 00:38:42 Bilal Ghalib in the\nfuture. He will provide and say yes, so if you have these equations, if you have the and I\nmust calculate the equations. 00:38:57 SPK_1Sure, sure. I mean, do we have people who can\nhelp in this matter? They can help in this matter, no problem, and even if, for example, we\nreached a certain point and saw that it means. Criteria to work on also, we are in\nSwitzerland. 00:39:26 SPK_1And we can get all the information from them. 00:39:28 SPK_3I\nexpect this, everything is very nice, I mean, I expect Marasi in what we are in but it is useful\nfor you, you Kasika, maybe I mean, do you not have social media to use these accounts? This\nplace is expected to be our concern. 00:39:50 Bilal Ghalib It is. I mean everything. It\nencourages, encourages people, and even people understand the subject, I mean when you\ngo and tell them green roofing, I don&#39;t know what, but when you go and tell them this, the\nah. The money for the electricity companies before and after, I mean it is very convincing\nand a delegation, something very, very, very nice, and then we can go back 00:40:15 SPK_3\nto the 00:40:18 Bilal Ghalib and the rest. 00:40:21 SPK_1 Yes, it is nice. I agree with you. I\nexpect, 00:40:23 SPK_3 Sheikh, we will work on it if we can. However, there is something\nvery clear that we can work on, and God willing, the accounts. 00:40:34 Bilal Ghalib It\nbenefits both of us, ah and they suit us at the same time? Once we do the selection my\ntraining partners we see about the subject money. 00:40:48 SPK_3 I mean they come and\nsee with people. 00:40:51 SPK_1 in the bike. 00:40:53 SPK_3 And they do I don&#39;t know, you\nsaid that they can mean they try the money they see? 00:41:04 Bilal Ghalib This is also\nsomething that occupies the mind in a different way, but one of the things that I don&#39;t know\numm if you have it, if it is acceptable I want to look for, the young men. 00:41:16 SPK_3 So\nlet&#39;s say the young men and women are open. Learn to be encouraged but they need them if\nit is permissible. To delve into the subject if there is any way in your mind? 00:41:33 Bilal\nGhalib Then. I mean if I look for things like this, what do I call them? So we will do what is\npermissible once, twice, three times.And then we gather the young men and women and\nbring them to Jab Fair, he wants to give them Artondis for future careers is it permissible?\n00:41:57 SPK_3Those who came out of those who want people. 00:42:14 SPK_1Hello. As a\nfellow. The sound is gone. But the sound has become, I mean, weak. It cuts out. 00:42:28\nSPK_3Better than iPhone? 00:42:33 SPK_1Yes, yes, better, sir, okay? Of course, we are\ncurrently at the present time, for example, yes, students from the universities come to us so\nthat they have, yes, a specific, okay, which is, for example, the graduation project for\nengineers, okay, so they need specific information, sometimes they need to take materials\nfrom us in the lab, so this cooperation exists. But I mean, I will be very happy that. 00:43:24\nSPK_1so that the subject becomes, I mean, in the form of a program. From us. On this\nsubject. So since we have a factory, we can do training not only for people. 00:43:49\n\nSPK_1By yes by yes in the laboratory or the lab, but also even if just one, for example. By.\nSales by. Mitigation we have a department, environment health and safety department.\n00:44:16 SPK_1I mean we have all, the different departments currently in Erbil. We can\nexpand it, that&#39;s what I mean, not only on production. Yes, on the contrary. By the way,\nEuropa, Europa, one of the companies, I forgot its name, but if you want. We can. Do.\n00:45:36 SPK_1On the subject that. I mean. There are people who worked on this subject, so\nthere was. I mean, benefit from that? 00:46:24 SPK_1Jordanian? Amen. Listen. Umm.\n00:48:33 SPK_1 I mean, for me, it will be as you mentioned, I mean, you definitely have in\nmind, yes, the perfect one, because it is definitely a lesson, yes, but I mean, yes, for you, and\nwe see, I am trying to do some kind of. So that I can see what you have and we can see.\n00:49:04 SPK_1 So, this, I mean, with what we have now, will come out as the best thing, I\nmean. So one of the things, for example, if it was just, I mean. It will be. I mean, the people\nwho are present today in Mosul or anywhere, in Erbil, anywhere, the young people who are.\n00:49:31 SPK_1, for example, did not complete their education? Okay? They are not\nengineers, but they want to work in this subject, okay, so we can train them, we can see\nthem, how you can work. We can, we can train them, we have no problem, I mean, even\nwhat I&#39;m thinking about now, and. I mean, just out loud, I&#39;m thinking that we can currently.\nWhat they are. 00:50:33 SPK_1It&#39;s possible that there could also be cooperation between us\nand them, that we let them start with us first, and then they go to, for example,. Okay, they\nstart working with them, so he can continue working with them? Or he can start his own\nsmall workshop, umm. 00:51:12 SPK_1We can, we can do. Yes, really. Really, I mean, we can\ndo this, umm, what else? For example, I had in mind? Now, see, we can also. It means you all\nmeet with Engineer Sana and Engineer Osama, these two, umm, they are young men that we\nare very proud of, we have Psyche Iraq. 00:52:00 SPK_1And they are coming in Sika and\ngold, I mean, it is wide if it is a year, a year, a year, he is the one who is in the market, he is\nthe one who deals with people, he is the one who sees the projects, he is the one who sees\nthe needs.

Here's a summary in the form of an email:\n\nSubject: Follow-up on our discussion about sustainable housing project in Mosul\n\nDear [Sika representative],\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our recent conversation regarding the sustainable housing project in Mosul and the potential collaboration between our organizations.\n\nTo summarize the key points we discussed and the actions I committed to:\n\n1. Training and Education Program: I will be developing a curriculum focused on sustainable construction techniques, including topics like green roofing, energy efficiency, and water conservation. I'd like to explore the possibility of incorporating Sika's expertise and products into this program.\n\n2. Practical Training: We discussed the possibility of conducting hands-on training sessions at your facility in Erbil. I'll be working on a proposal for this, including potential dates and the number of participants.\n\n3. Cost-Benefit Analysis: I'm very interested in the cost-benefit calculations you mentioned regarding proper insulation materials versus cheaper alternatives. If possible, could you share any data or case studies you have on this? This information would be invaluable for our training program.\n\n4. Meeting with Sana and Osama: You suggested I meet with Engineers Sana and Osama from Sika Iraq. I'd like to set up a meeting with them to discuss the project further and gain insights from their market experience.\n\n5. Internship Opportunities: We briefly touched on the possibility of setting up internships for program participants with Sika. I'll draft a preliminary plan for this and share it with you for your feedback.\n\n6. Visit to Erbil: As discussed, I'm planning to visit Erbil next month. I'll send you my specific dates once they're confirmed so we can arrange a meeting.\n\nLastly, as promised, I'll be sending a more detailed project proposal soon, which will include our training objectives, target audience, and potential collaboration points with Sika.\n\nThank you again for your time and valuable insights. I'm looking forward to our continued collaboration on this exciting project.\n\nBest regards,\nBilal Ghalib",
