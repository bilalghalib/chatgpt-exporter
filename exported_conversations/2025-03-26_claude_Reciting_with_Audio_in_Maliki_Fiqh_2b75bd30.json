Let me search for specific information about this topic.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\n\n\nLet me provide a helpful answer about reciting while listening to audio in Maliki fiqh.\n\nIn Maliki fiqh and Islamic jurisprudence more broadly, there's an important distinction between various ways of engaging with the Quran:\n\n1. Reading the Quran directly (tilawah/qira'ah) - reciting with your tongue while looking at the text\n2. Listening to Quranic recitation \n3. Following along visually while listening to an audio recitation\n\nBased on the search results, here's what I found about your specific question:\n\nWhile the search didn't provide a direct Maliki ruling on reciting while listening to audio, Islamic scholars generally differentiate between active recitation (using one's tongue) and passive reading or listening. Some permit \"reading\" the Quran in one's mind without actually reciting it with the lips and tongue.\n\nAccording to scholars, both reading the Quran and listening to its recitation with reflection are considered among the best acts of worship. Tilawah (recitation) includes both listening to the Quran as well as reading it while moving the tongue when pronouncing the words and looking at the text (mushaf).\n\nWhen it comes to reciting alongside a recorded recitation, it appears to be permissible, especially for those learning proper pronunciation. However, proper etiquette suggests being attentive before reciting yourself and reciting in a lower volume than the recording.\n\nAs for specific evidence in Maliki fiqh, the search results don't provide direct textual evidence (dalil) from Imam Malik on this specific question about reciting while listening to audio. The concept of simultaneously reciting while listening to audio is relatively modern and may not have specific rulings from classical sources.\n\nMost scholars seem to agree that both recitation and listening are valuable forms of worship, and Muslims are encouraged to engage with the Quran in whatever manner helps them understand, reflect, and connect with its meanings.\n\nIf you're seeking a more specific ruling with evidence from Maliki scholars, I would recommend consulting with a qualified Maliki scholar who could provide more detailed evidence from the madhhab's authoritative texts.",

[Al-Mawsu’a Al-Fiqhhiyya] If the singing is free from the above elements and does not distract one from their religious obligations, it is permissible, especially if it contains admonishments or beneficial wisdom. [Ibid] ... Due to the various textual evidence with regards to musical instruments, the scholars differed. Some scholars took a relaxed approach with regards to spiritual music such as Imam ‘Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi in his Idah al-Dalalat fi Sama‘ al-Alat. Others, on the other hand, have taken a very strict approach and this approach is congruous to the mainstream opinion of all four schools. ... According to most Scholars, the Duff Drum is excluded from the general prohibition of musical instruments.\n\nEach of the four Schools of Law, the Hanafî, Maliki, Shafi‘i, and Hanbali Schools, regard song accompanied by musical instruments as unlawful (haram). [Karaan, The Islamic Ruling on Music and Raising Funds via Unlawful Means] Individual fatawa (legal rulings) have permitted some forms of music within certain restrictions. While there are some differing views and conditions, most scholars opine that beating the duff is permissible, especially on special occasions, and Allah knows best. Imam Al-Nawawi states in Minhaj at‐Talibin: Singing without musical accompaniment is makruh (disliked), as is listening to it. It is haram (unlawful) to use an instrument that is characteristic of those who consume intoxicants, such as the tunbur (an instrument resembling the mandolin), the ‘ud (lute), the sanj (cymbal), the ‘Iraqi mizmar (a type of flute), but not the yura‘(flute).\n\nContending that the evidence for the prohibition of music is either weak, ambiguous, or both, scholars such as Al-Qadi Abu Bakr Ibn Al- ‘Arabi, Imam Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali, Ibn An-Nahwi, Ibn Tahir, Ibn Hazm, and Shaykh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi. While the above individual scholars permitted music, their strict rules (such as lawful lyrics and rhythms which do not “intoxicate”) should always be considered. Many contemporary scholars hold this view, which is probably easier in light of current circumstances, and Allah knows best. Concerning music beyond our control, such as computer sounds and what we hear in passing, one has no control over the actions of others and will not be held accountable by Allah for their deeds.",

Answer: All praise be to Allah, and may His peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. Reading the Glorious Quran and listening to its recitation with reflection are both considered among the best acts of worship. Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, \"Whoever recites a letter from the Book of Alla will be credited with a good deed, and a good deed gets a ten-fold reward.\n\nSo I recited Surah al-Nisaa until I came to this ayah: (How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people.)

Then I turned to him, and there were tears in his eyes.\" (Related by Bukhari) In differentiating acts of worship, there is no recourse but to depend upon evidence, for if no evidence is found which prefers one act of worship to another, then we must be silent about the matter, and direct every worshiper of Allah to what Allah opens to him by it, for whoever finds his enthusiasm in recitation occupies himself with it most, and whoever finds his enthusiasm in listening and paying attention to what he hears occupies himself with that most .If we believed that reading (quira'a) was preferable; recitation (tilawah) includes listening to reading itself, and includes more than that, and that is reading while moving the tongue in pronouncing the words of\n\nRead answers with similar topics: Acts of worship evidence eyes Quran tirmidhi · Is reading the Qur’an in the mind equivalent to having the same reward with one pronouncing the alphabets loudly?

As […]\n\nQuestion: What can a menstruating women do in terms of reading the Qur’an? Can one choose the Maliki position on the issue? ... In the Hanafi school, she can listen to the Qur’an and “read” (in her mind) without “reciting” (with her tongue) while memorizing during menstruation. As for choosing the Maliki opinion, this is a matter of personal choice, at the end of the day. The scholars generally have two ways of dealing with the issue of following another madhhab than one’s own: 1. It is permitted to do so, but without making it a habit to always “seek out” dispensations; 2. One may not do so without a genuine hardship and need, for otherwise it is “following one’s whims,” which the Shariah has interdicted. Generally, my Syrian Hanafi teachers took the former position, though the Indian and Pakistani scholars are firm on the second position.\n\nThe scholars of the sunni way agree, though, that the four schools, are all valid to follow, and each represents a sound operationalization of the Qur’an and Sunna, based on the interpretative principles laid down by its mujtahids. As such, a person who follows a position of any one of the four schools cannot be considered to be “going against” the Qur’an or Sunna. A well-versed scholar who understands the primary texts, fiqh, and usul, may disagree with another school, but the agreed-upon principle of sunni fuqaha is: “My position is correct with the possibility of being wrong. The position of others is wrong, with the possibility of being right,” because such differences only arose because of the probabilistic nature of the primary evidences. In the case you mention, it is true that what they mentioned is the position of Imam Malik (Allah be pleased with him), though the majority of the mujtahid imams, including Abu Hanifa and his students, did not agree, because of the primary evide\n\nJust beware of making it a habit to seek out dispensations, and beware of those who have a habit of handing out fatwas from different schools: it is hard enough for true fuqaha to master one school, let alone four (or more). I specifically asked Shaykh Hassaan al-Hindi, in Damascus, about a sister taking the Maliki dispensation on this issue, and he said that there is nothing wrong with it. I asked, “Sidi, but what if she wants to stick to her madhhab?” He said, “Well, that is her choice.” · However, if you don’t feel comfortable or prefer to stick to the second approach, this is being cautious in religion. Just beware, though, of not creating fitna or ‘discussing’ with teachers or students why you are not reciting… · This was something posted a while back on the Hanafi fiqh list: It is not religiously binding on the Muslim to stick to one school on all matters, without exception, as both al-Tahtawi and Ibn Abidin (Allah have mercy on them), the two leading late authorities for fatwa i\n\nhttps://seekersguidance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Quran-2.jpg 698 954 sufyan https://seekersguidance.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SG_Logo_v23.svg sufyan2010-09-03 22:03:272022-05-08 15:45:57A Menstruating Woman Reciting the Qur’an: The Maliki Position, Sticking to One School, and the Path of Taqwa ...

Whoever prefers to read the Qur`an should do so more frequently and whoever prefers to listen to it attentively should do so more frequently. Making tilawah (reciting) of the Qur`an includes listening to it as well as reading. More than that, it is reading while moving the tongue when pronouncing the words of God and looking at the mus-haf; it for these reasons that recitation is preferable. In any case, a Muslim should vary his efforts. He should recite the Qur`an at times and listen to it attentively at others. He should also do what he, in his heart, believes to be closer to humble submission, reflection and understanding of the verses of the Qur`an. And God knows best.\n\nIbn Mas`ud (may God be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of God (peace and blessings be upon him) said, \"Whoever recites a letter from the Book of God, will be recompensed with a good deed and a good deed is multiplied tenfold. I do not say that Alif-Lam-Mim is one letter, but Alif is one letter, Lam is one letter and Mim is one letter” [recorded by At-Tirmidhi]. 'Abdullah bin Masud also narrated the following: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) told me, “’Recite to me’. So I said, ‘O Messenger of God! How can I recite to you, when it [the Quran] was sent down to you?!’ He said, ‘Yes [recite].’ So I recited the chapter of Al-Nisaa` until I reached the verse: ‘(How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people.)’ Whereupon he (the Prophet) said, ‘That is enough for now’.

Playing an audio of the Qur’an and listening attentively is also very meritorious and a useful alternative when you’re unable to recite yourself, particularly if it enables you to contemplate and reflect deeply over the Qur’an, its miracle, meanings and beauty. As for recitation of verses which are comprised of remembrance (dhikr), such as the throne verse (ayat al-kursi), and doing so with the intention of remembrance, it is permitted. Another example is the verse: “Allah is sufficient for me. There is no god worthy of worship except Him. In Him I put my trust.

Consequently, her fulfilment of this command without objection is a means of tremendous reward with Allah Most High. This is because it is the kind of worship which is free from spiritual waywardness which can creep into other acts, such as showing off (riya’), being pleased with one’s works (‘ujb) and other detrimental sins of the heart. Further, there are other remembrances (adhkar) and formulations of sending blessings (salawat) upon the Blessed Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) which can be used for healing and otherwise.

In fact the scholars of the past (the mutaqadimun) have considered listening to these musical instruments permissible since as a principle (in Islamic law) all things are considered a prior permissible until there is indisputable evidence from the sharia (Quran and sunna) to prove otherwise. Thus, the Islamic ruling regarding all forms of musical instruments is the same. There is no single evidence from the sharia to prove that they are either prohibited or allowed. All the trad\n\nWhenever the jurists have ruled the use of some musical instruments to be allowed while prohibiting others, it is because the prohibited instruments have always been used to incite the listener to engage in immoral behaviour. This does not mean that the instrument itself is haram. We see this clearly in the way the Hanafi, Shafii, and Hanbali jurists as well as the Maliki scholar Ibn Arabi have explained their positions that musical instruments should not be accompanied by immoral acts and vices. Thus, after a detailed and thorough study of all the evidence for and against music, the author of the book al-Sama (listening) Muhammad Ibn Tahir Ibn Ali Ibn Ahmad Ibn Abi al-Hasan al-Shaybani Abu al-Fadl al-Maqdisi well-known as Ibn al-Qaysarani a great expert in the field of hadith declared that there is no difference at all between listening to one type of instrument or another since there exist no single textual evidence, whether authentic or inauthentic, for or against the use of instrum\n\nHowever, if a person listens to music with the intention of relaxing himself so that he can be strong and active enough to engage in the obedience of God he will be judged as a good and obedient person and his action (of listening to music) is valid. If a person intents neither obedience nor disobedience he will be judged as a person who has engaged in laghw (pointless action) which is excused and overlooked (by God). It will be treated in the same way as a walk in the park (tanazzuh). Bukhari included a section in his Sahih (vol.9, p171 towards the end of the chapter of seeking permission. Published by Amiriya Press, years 1305 on the margins of Sahih Muslim) as a chapter under the title every form of amusement is invalid (batil) if it keeps an individual away from the obedience of God. In al-Rashad al-Sari he (Imam Bukhari) adds the following statement after the title: even though it would have been permissible under other circumstances just like a person who becomes so pre-occupied ",

Reading the Quran directly (tilawah/qira'ah) - reciting with your tongue while looking at the text\n2. Listening to Quranic recitation \n3. Following along visually while listening to an audio recitation\n\nBased on the search results, here's what I found about your specific question:\n\nWhile the search didn't provide a direct Maliki ruling on reciting while listening to audio, Islamic scholars generally differentiate between active recitation (using one's tongue) and passive reading or listening. Some permit \"reading\" the Quran in one's mind without actually reciting it with the lips and tongue.\n\nAccording to scholars, both reading the Quran and listening to its recitation with reflection are considered among the best acts of worship. Tilawah (recitation) includes both listening to the Quran as well as reading it while moving the tongue when pronouncing the words and looking at the text (mushaf).\n\nWhen it comes to reciting alongside a recorded recitation, it appears to be permissible, especially for those learning proper pronunciation. However, proper etiquette suggests being attentive before reciting yourself and reciting in a lower volume than the recording.\n\nAs for specific evidence in Maliki fiqh, the search results don't provide direct textual evidence (dalil) from Imam Malik on this specific question about reciting while listening to audio. The concept of simultaneously reciting while listening to audio is relatively modern and may not have specific rulings from classical sources.\n\nMost scholars seem to agree that both recitation and listening are valuable forms of worship, and Muslims are encouraged to engage with the Quran in whatever manner helps them understand, reflect, and connect with its meanings.\n\nIf you're seeking a more specific ruling with evidence from Maliki scholars, I would recommend consulting with a qualified Maliki scholar who could provide more detailed evidence from the madhhab's authoritative texts.",
