ITC is 100% \"Aid for Trade\", supporting trade that delivers inclusive and sustainable development results. ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and transition economies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs) Fragile States and Sub-Saharan Africa. To support a more inclusive distribution of development gains, ITC works with women, youth, and marginalized groups in developing countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that provide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation.  The Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq, implemented by UN-Habitat, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent work and affordable housing. This multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive investment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq's National Public Works Programme, enhancing capacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting trade-led private sector engagement in climate-smart construction, and empowering social partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these components, BEIT focuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools and legislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social dialogue and capacity building among social partners, all to address housing challenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating climate change impacts in the housing sector.  Output 3.3 of the project is designed to enhance the capabilities of local businesses, particularly focusing on young entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative practices into their operations. This includes a comprehensive approach to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the development of sustainable and innovative capabilities, especially in sectors like climate-smart solutions and innovative construction technology. The project plans to:  1. Reinforce Business Development Services: Strengthening the portfolio of service providers to offer training, coaching, and mentoring in areas critical for sustainable and innovative business practices.  2.

I'll give you a short bio, and maybe you can help me come up with a great motivation statement.\n\nI am bilal Ghalib, an Iraqi american with an Iraqi passport recently aquired. I have worked hard on it since 2018 because ever since I was young, I felt the beauty of my father's opportunity to be in us and the pain of watching my cousins live through such difficulty. I felt a calling in high school; this is all connected; the difficulty there is related to the ease I am living in America. When people like my father leave and contribute their amazing skills something important has left the country of Iraq and i promised myself when I had that insight that i would become a bridge builder, I didn't know if I could ever return yet I wanted to do what i could to bridge worlds, like me, American <->Iraqi Iraqi <-> american how could we bring more equality of opportunity to the world so that people like my father could dream of a future where they would be able to stay in the land they love? It didn't become clear till I graduated college, witnessed the Arab Spring, and saw young people around my age taking to the street, wanting a better future and a country they would be proud of. Their belief was a political change; at that moment, I was working on propagating what I had called PBLEs - passion-based learning environments; others know them as maker spaces, fab labs, etc. I started one in Michigan called All Hands Active and realized there's another way to a better future: make it yourself. It's a bit libertarian, yet working as an outsider in the Middle East and being less politically motivated were assets. I raised my funds from Kickstarter as the world was ready to bring this idea to fruition. That was what led me to create GEMSI (the global entrepreneurship and maker space initiative) to help establish collectivly organized spaces for learning and development. While i started mostly in the technical space I quickly realized that some of the most important parts of building comes before putting pen to paper. it comes with intention. why are people doing this? one day there was a 3 car car bomb blast in iraq and i was there - the hackerspace community that i was so hopeful would be a beacon of hope and responding with care and wondering how they could help simply said \"we'll do our show and tell next week\" of course that's the only sane thing to do when there is a car bomb every 3 days. i made a \"song\" to visuzlize the frequency of the attacks where the high hat on the drums represented the days and the base drum represented bombs with the intensity of the base being the number of the dead. It made my blood turn to ice. I couldn't imagine being the the organizers of fikra space (hackerspace in iraq's name of org) living in iraq throught that period 2003-2014 and caring for every bomb. yet i decided i wanted to connect my work with goodness and realized that what i was hleping was to bring what is inside people out into the world. creativity + skill = production of art, projects, etc. and one of my foundational beliefs is that people are good. if i didn't believe that then i wouldn't be able to live, we are good, we have the capacity of good and when we open the door inward and understand ourselves and motivations and don't act on blind impulse - we see how we really want to respond, which is with goodness when we see pain in the world. this is why i shifted my creativity and entrepreneurship work by giving peoplet echnical skills and encouraging people to start projects and businesses based on an abstract competency and \"do what you love\" or some random idea like that. I realized that if i really cared for people and their wellbeing and happiness i had to help them find a work that would bring them meaning and purpose. i had to understand what the underlying foundations of a true life of flourishing was. this coincided with me identifying my PTSD from working in Iraq and Syria and the work i did to heal helped me understand how we can be so ugly and how learning must include personal and professional learning - even for the simple matter that our professional efforts come from a very personal place, the self.
