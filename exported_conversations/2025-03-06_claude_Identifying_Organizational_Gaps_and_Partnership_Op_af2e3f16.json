How are you doing today? \nToday will be the first step in a series of leadership sessions that will help you strengthen your business operations. Before bringing in new team members, it’s essential to assess your organizational gaps and explore different ways to fill those gaps. \n\n\nIdentify the skills and knowledge gaps in your business.\n\nLearn how to fill gaps by building strong partnerships.\n\nCreate a plan to build partnerships based on your business needs.\n\n\n\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nIdentify the skills and knowledge gaps in your business.\nLearn how to fill gaps by building strong partnerships.\nCreate a plan to build partnerships based on your business needs.\n\nYOUR BUSINESS MODEL:\nREVENUE STREAMS\nCOST STRUCTURE\nCUSTOMER SEGMENT\nCHANNELS\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nVALUE PROPOSITION\nKEY RESOURCES\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nKEY PARTNERS\n*https://strategyzer.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/topics/113454-using-our-tools-canvases-methods\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe trainer should recap where we are on the BMC. \nWe have already talked a lot about the right side of the BMC. We have been developing our products/services to fit the needs of our different customer segments. We have also looked at how those products and services will bring in profits through our revenue and cost structures. Now we are going to look at the left side of our BMC which is the internal part of our business. \n\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nMarketing\nLogistics\nProduct Development\nOperations\nStrategy\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nThe first step to identify your business gaps, is to understand all the activities and resources you need to efficiently and effectively deliver your product/service to your customer.\n\nAsk: What are all the key activities (or actions) that we need to do in order to deliver our products/services to our customers? – Write all answers on the whiteboard. Try to get entrepreneurs to be specific.\nPotential answers:\nMarketing\nResearching customers needs\nCreating marketing materials\nPosting ads\nHolding events\nUnderstanding customer values and sustainability preferences\nLogistics\nDelivery\nStorage\nTransportation\nSupply chain monitoring\nResource efficiency management\nProduct development\nApp maintenance\nMarket research\nPrototyping and testing\nMaterial selection and optimization\nDesigning for durability/longevity\nOperations\nProduction\nFinance\nHR\nResource management\nWaste reduction\nEnvironmental compliance\nStrategy\nPlanning\nPartnerships\nFinancing\nRisk assessment\nResilience planning\nWhen listing these, note that activities like resource management and waste reduction not only address environmental concerns but can significantly reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.\n\nIf entrepreneurs are having a hard time thinking about key activities, consider going over the points shown in this Mckinsey model to help entrepreneurs brainstorm some other key activities and resources needed. The seven areas of organization are divided into the ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ areas. Strategy, structure and systems are hard elements that are much easier to identify and manage when compared to soft elements. On the other hand, soft areas, although harder to manage, are the foundation of the organization and are more likely to create the sustained competitive advantage.\nStrategy is a plan developed by a firm to achieve sustained competitive advantage and successfully compete in the market. Someone needs to be focusing on creating a well-aligned strategy that is clearly articulated, long-term, and helps to achieve competitive advantage.\nStructure represents the way business divisions and units are organized and includes the information of who is accountable to whom. Someone needs to organize the company in terms of management and organizational structure and tasks.\nSystems are the processes and procedures of the company, which reveal business’ daily activities and how decisions are made. What are the systems that are in place (or need to be created) that determine how business is done and it should be the main focus for managers during organizational change.\nSkills are the abilities that firm’s employees perform very well. They also include capabilities and competences. During organizational change, the question often arises of what skills the company will really need to reinforce its new strategy or new structure. Each business will need specific skills. Tourism business needs someone knowledgeable about local historical sites and fun places to go. A consulting business needs employees with technical business knowledge. What specific skills do you need?\nStaff element is concerned with what type and how many employees an organization will need and how they will be recruited, trained, motivated and rewarded. Someone needs to train and onboard staff!\nStyle represents the way the company is managed by top-level managers, how they interact, what actions do they take and their symbolic value. In other words, it is the management style of company’s leaders. Setting a company culture could be considered a key activity. How do you make sure that all areas of the business are abiding by your policies and living by the company culture?\nShared Values are at the core of McKinsey 7s model. They are the norms and standards that guide employee behavior and company actions and thus, are the foundation of every organization. Many successful businesses now include people and planetary health among their core values, recognizing that wellbeing and efficiency makes good business sense. \nYou can also use a SWOT analysis to find gaps and identify both efficiency opportunities and potential resource risks.\n\nRecap: Doing this can help you in a few ways including:\nTo help understand the gaps that may appear in the business\nIdentify which areas you should focus on to optimize or boost your business performance\nThink about the results of future changes within your business\n\nGiven my key activities,\nwhat are MY capabilities?\n\nKey Activities – My Capabilities = Business Needs\nWhat am I good at?\nWhat are the roles and responsibilities I can take?\n\nWHAT CAN I DO MYSELF?\n5-10 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nNext, we should take a look at all the things that we can do ourselves. \nAsk: Which of these things (on the board) can we do on our own? What processes could be optimized to improve efficiency? Think about if it was just 1 founder running this business. What can they realistically do?  \nCircle each of the things on the board and identify if you can do them or not: \nPotential answers:\nMarketing\nResearching customers needs - I can do this, and should do it often.\nCreating marketing materials - I can do this, but I am not good at it. \nPosting ads - I can do this.\nHolding eventI can do this, but might need some help.\nLogistics\nDelivery - I don’t have the capacity to do this with the number of orders I am expecting.\nStorage - I have space for a small amount of storage. I can do this now, but need to find another solution as I grow..\nTransportation - I can’t do this. There is too much to deliver to and from cities. \nResource tracking- I can implement basic monitoring, but need help with systems for tracking material and energy use\nProduct development\nApp maintenance - I can’t do this. \nMarket research - I can do this.\nPrototyping and testing - I can do this except for the technical parts (coding).\nMaterial efficiency- I understand basic concepts but may need expertise to identify all optimization opportunities.\nOperations\nProduction - I can do this, but will need help as I grow. \nFinance - I can do this now, but will need help as I grow.\nHR - I can do this, and should be very involved. \nWaste management - I can implement basic waste reduction practices\nStrategy – As the founder, I should be heavily involved in the strategic parts of my business!\nPlanning\nPartnerships\nFinancing\nMarketing\nRisk Assessment\n\nAsk: When thinking about what you can do yourself, what are some things that you should keep in mind?\nWhat you are good at. What skills are you lacking?\nWhat you are excited and happy doing.\nWhat you have time and energy to do.\nWhat you (a founder) should be focusing your energy on, \nand what you can delegate to others. \nYour budget and ability to delegate things to others.\nEtc…\n\nFinally, once you have identified your key activities and what you are currently able to do, you are clearly able to see the gaps! Point out all the areas that aren’t circled on the whiteboard. We need to find a way to get those things done. \n\n5\n\nWHAT’S NEXT?\nDo it yourself!\nHire\nPartner\n3-5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: Once you identified the gaps, what are the three primary ways to fill them?\nDo it yourself: We already talked about things that you can do yourself; however, if you want to grow your business and have it be successful, you need to enroll others to join your team and operations. \nPartner: Another thing you can do is partner with someone to help you do those things. You can outsource another person or company to help you to fill that gap. Maybe you aren’t good at marketing, you can use an advertising agency to help you fill that gap, for example. We will go more into this point today!\nHire: Another way is through hiring someone onto your team to fill the gap. We will go deep in this part in the next lead session!\n\nIDENTIFYING YOUR BUSINESS GAPS!\n\u000b\n\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nCURRENT STATE\nMarketing\n\u000b\nDelivery\n\u000b\nLogistics\n\u000b\nApp Maintenance\n\u000b\nOperations\n\u000b\nFinance\n\u000b\nHR\n\u000b\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nCURRENT STATE\nFUTURE STATE\nMarketing\n\u000b\n\u000b\nDelivery\n\u000b\n\u000b\nLogistics\n\u000b\n\u000b\nApp Maintenance\n\u000b\n\u000b\nOperations\n\u000b\n\u000b\nFinance\n\u000b\n\u000b\nHR\n\u000b\n\u000b\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nCURRENT STATE\nFUTURE STATE\nCHANGE GAP\nCHANGE ACTIVITIES\nMarketing\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nDelivery\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nLogistics\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nApp Maintenance\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nOperations\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nFinance\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nHR\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n45 minutes: Activity\n\nAfter we explain the process of identifying gaps and the ways to fill those gaps, we will have an activity to apply it in the handouts folder. \nEach entrepreneur will work on identifying their gaps and setting a plan to fill those gaps. \n30 minutes: Individually work on the handout. The trainer will be around to help people fill out the document the right way. \n15 minutes: Group discussion and sharing. What are the biggest gaps entrepreneurs are facing? What are the major challenges entrepreneurs are facing to fill those gaps? Are there ways to work with each other to fill those gaps?\n\nPARTNERSHIP\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWe will now go deeper into strategic partnerships as one of the ways to fill organizational gaps. We will look at examples of different types of partnerships and the benefits that each one has. \nAsk: Before we give some examples, what do you think are the different types of partnerships you can have? Think of ways that you can work with other people to have mutually beneficial outcomes?\nPotential answers:\nBuyer-supplier partnerships can help you get better deals and manage your workflows better.\nYou can partner with companies and organizations that have similar missions to yours to spread awareness about your business or help each other get customers,\nAn investor is a partner! \nYou can partner with influencers on social media,\nEtc…\n\n\nA partnership is an arrangement where 2 or more individuals or groups agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests.\nWHAT IS A PARTNERSHIP?\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nBasically, a partnership is an arrangement where 2 or more individuals or groups agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. The partners in a partnership may be individuals, businesses, interest-based organizations, schools, governments, or any combination of those things. We will now go over a few examples of common types of partnerships.\n\n\n9\n\nJoint Venture Partner\nA joint venture occurs when two or more businesses join together to pursue a common project.\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS:\n+\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nHere you may join your company with another to create an entirely different entity, which may be more profitable for the both of you than if you were to operate separately.\n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a joint venture (you don’t have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\nUniversal and Warner Bros. are entering a joint venture on sales, marketing and distribution of Blue Ray DVDs in North America. Separately, Universal will handle distribution for WB’s physical media in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan starting in Q3 of 2020 while WB will do the same for Universal’s physical media in the U.K., Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Under the proposed structure, the studios will continue to operate their digital distribution businesses independently and retain content and consumer marketing for both physical and digital.\nYou can have another person join as a partner.  silent investor, they are not decision making people, they don’t have a certain role in the business. Vs of the general partner that has a certain role and they are decision making persons. Here is an example of a limited (silent) partner vs general (active) partner: \nLet’s say, “Shwan” runs a food café business and has “Majd” as his partner. In this business, Shwan is the general partner whereas Majd is a limited partner. “Majd” has given $1 million in the business as a capital investment. The money helps “Shwan”, pay for his staff expenses and purchase raw material. “Majd”, does not participate in running the business but receives monthly share out of the profits.\nBMW Group and Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) are pursuing their successful strategic long-term cooperation in the field of sustainable mobility today by signing binding agreements aimed at long-term collaboration between the two companies for the joint development of a fuel cell system, joint development of architecture and components for a sports vehicle, and joint research and development of lightweight technologies. These agreements follow a memorandum of understanding signed in June 2012.\n\n\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a joint venture?\nTo combine resources. A bigger entity may have more clout in an industry or more resources to ensure the success of a venture. \nJoint ventures have shared investment, expenses, and profits (or losses). \nTo combine expertise. In technical businesses, one company might have expertise in one part of a venture while the second company might have expertise in another part. For example, Company A might be good at creating software, while Company B has experience creating the hardware that's needed for a venture.\nTo save money. Two companies might consider a joint venture to save money on advertising, maybe at a trade show or in a trade publication.\nTo enter a foreign market. In this case, a foreign company forms a joint venture with a U.S. company that is in the market the foreign company wants to enter.\nTo manage rental property. A joint venture may form a partnership to own and rent properties together.\n\n10\n\nStrategic Alliance Partner\n\nAn agreement between two or more parties to pursue a set of agreed upon objectives needed while remaining independent organizations. \nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP:\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThis means that you and a company that you have no direct competition with, industry wise, will partner together in ways that will benefit the both of you.\n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a strategic alliance (you don’t have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\nLocal example: Mr. Erbil and Lala Candles joined together to create Mr. Erbil branded candles. They used Mr. Erbil’s luxury brand name and Lala candles high quality product to create something new that they can both benefit from. \nSpotify and Uber: Leaping forward to a very recent piece of news, Spotify and Uber have partnered to provide stereo control to Uber customers. Not every Spotify consumer uses Uber, nor does every Uber rider have a Spotify account. The strategic alliance allows each company to pursue prospects from the other’s existing customer base, all while continuing to promote both products. In both cases, it gives the company a leg up over its competition. Spotify is offering something with the Premium package that other streaming services do not yet have. And likewise, Uber can provide the riders with an opportunity to listen to their own playlists as opposed to other ride-share services that cannot match them yet.\nYou can partner with a manufacturer to produce a part of your business product that you yourself may not be able to manufacture. In return, you have a contract to pay for these parts that your partner has made you.\nStarbucks has created several strategic alliances that you can see on the next slide. \nhttps://www.allbound.com/resource-center/successful-strategic-alliances-5-examples-of-companies-doing-it-right/\n\n\n11\n\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP:\nStrategic alliance partnership example:\n\n\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nStarbucks has created several strategic alliances that have helped them increase sales and reduce costs related to production and distribution of their products. \nThey partnered with Barnes and Nobles bookstores in 1993 to provide in-house coffee shops, benefiting both retailers.\nIn 1996, Starbucks partnered with PepsiCo to bottle, distribute, and sell the popular coffee-based drink (Frappuccino). In this situation they benefited off of PepsiCo’s highly efficient manufacturing and distribution channels. \nA Starbucks – United airlines alliance has resulted in their coffee being offered on flights with the Starbucks logo on the cups\n\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a strategic alliance? \nSharing resources and expertise. \nNew-market penetration. In some cases, a strategic alliance gives access to new markets with a solution that wouldn’t have been possible for either company on their own. For instance, companies going global often work with a trusted local partner to get an advantage in an emerging market.\nExpanded production. When it comes to manufacturing and distributing products, strategic alliances allow partners to increase their capabilities and scale quickly to meet demand.\nDrive innovation. With the right alliance, partners can outpace the competition with new solutions that are a complete package for their customers. These alliances are creative and revolutionary and change the market landscape in a dramatic way.\nStrategic alliances allow partners to scale quickly, build innovative solutions for their customers, enter new markets, and pool valuable expertise and resources. And, in a business environment that values speed and innovation, this is a game-changer.\nhttps://www.workspan.com/blog/strategic-alliance-definition/\n\nThis means that you and a company that you have no direct competition with, industry wise, will partner together in ways that will benefit the both of you.\n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a strategic alliance (you don't have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\n\nLocal example: Mr. Erbil and Lala Candles joined together to create Mr. Erbil branded candles. They used Mr. Erbil's luxury brand name and Lala candles high quality product to create something new that they can both benefit from.\n\nSpotify and Uber: Leaping forward to a very recent piece of news, Spotify and Uber have partnered to provide stereo control to Uber customers. Not every Spotify consumer uses Uber, nor does every Uber rider has a Spotify account. The strategic alliance allows each company to pursue prospects from the other's existing customer base, all while continuing to promote both products.\n\nResource-sharing example: A business with excess warehouse space partners with a complementary business needing storage, reducing costs for both while optimizing resource use.\n\nEfficiency partnership: A restaurant partners with a local farm to secure reliable produce while reducing transportation costs and ensuring freshness. The farm gains a steady customer while the restaurant can market its locally-sourced ingredients.\n\nTechnology-sharing example: A clothing manufacturer partners with a tech company that has developed water-efficient dyeing technology. The clothing company reduces production costs through water savings, while the tech company gets to scale its innovation.\n\nYou can partner with a manufacturer to produce a part of your business product that you yourself may not be able to manufacture. This can include suppliers with expertise in resource-efficient materials or processes that help reduce your costs.\n\nStarbucks has created several strategic alliances that you can see on the next slide.\n\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP:\nStrategic alliance partnership example:\n\n\nStrategic Alliance Partner\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nSchaduf and Agropro Monitor have created a strategic alliance that has helped them increase their market reach and enhance their product offerings:\nThey partnered to combine Schaduf's expertise in precision agriculture and water management with Agropro's advanced crop monitoring technologies.\nThis alliance allows them to jointly develop technologies tailored to the specific agricultural needs of the Middle East and Africa.\nSchaduf will exclusively market Agropro Monitor's services across the region, creating a comprehensive solution that neither company could offer alone.\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a strategic alliance?\nCombining complementary expertise. In this case, water management from Schaduf and pest management from Agropro.\nNew-market penetration. The alliance helps a Brazilian company enter Middle Eastern markets with a trusted local partner.\nExpanded offerings. The partnership creates a more comprehensive solution that addresses multiple farmer needs simultaneously.\nDrive innovation. Together they can develop technologies specifically tailored to regional agricultural challenges.\nhttps://schaduf.com/schaduf-and-agropro-monitor-join-forces-to-revolutionize-middle-east-and-african-agriculture/\n\n\nCompetition Partner\nA group of competing companies come together to develop a solution for a problem that they all share, and none of them would gain a competitive advantage.\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP:\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nIn these relationships, one or both partners views the other partner's success as something to thwart or outdo rather than a joint victory. Such a partnership will help spread the risk both companies may take. \n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a competition partner (you don’t have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\nPfizer + Merck: Another successful example of competitive collaboration is the powerful alliance between Pfizer and Merck (both in pharmaceuticals). These pharma companies entered a strategic partnership to bring new cancer treatments to the market as soon as possible. Although they are competitors, they invested together to save money and find solutions that they can both benefit from faster. \nSamsung and Sony formed an agreement in 2004 to share research and development costs in an effort to both design flat screen LED television. Again, they are both competitors who invested in something they can both benefit from. \nYouTube and Vimeo have a similar relationship. During an innovation panel at the 2019 ForbesWomen Summit, Vimeo CEO Anjali Sud shared that the video platform joined forces with YouTube, one of its main competitors by allowing creators to publish their videos to YouTube, as well as to other video platforms.\nGoogle supported Mozilla (Firefox web-browser), a rival to Google Chrome, in order to limit the expanding influence of Microsoft Internet Explorer and Apple Safari.\n\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a competition partnership?\nOutcompete another competitor\nIt may also help when both partners are trying to do something new and share the risk of investment.\nIt could mean a confirmed supply stream. For example, there is a need for earth metals in mobile phones. So securing the supply of rare earth metals could be the reason for competitors to form a strategic partnership.\n\n14\n\nFinancing & Distribution partnerships help businesses reach more customers by combining a product or service with financing or market access.\nFinancing & Distribution Partnership\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP\nFinancing & Distribution Partnership\n5 minutes: Lecture + Discussion\nKESK and Vitas Iraq have partnered to expand access to solar energy solutions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in Iraq through innovative financing.\nKESK, Iraq’s first greentech company, provides solar-powered cooling and energy solutions to businesses.\nVitas Iraq, a microfinance institution, offers loans to SMEs looking to invest in solar energy but lacking upfront capital.\nThis partnership allows businesses to switch to solar energy affordably, reducing electricity costs by up to 70%, maintaining operations during power outages, and cutting reliance on diesel generators.\nA pilot project provided financing for 100 businesses to adopt KESK solar-powered AC units, proving the viability of the model.\nAsk: Why do businesses form financing & distribution partnerships?\nExpanding market access—KESK can sell more solar systems, reaching customers who otherwise couldn't afford them.\nLowering financial barriers—Vitas Iraq benefits from offering a high-demand financial product while driving sustainable development.\nSupporting economic resilience—By providing a clean, cost-effective alternative to unreliable grid power, businesses can improve productivity.\nEncouraging green energy adoption—Businesses become early adopters of climate-resilient infrastructure with financing support.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/keskco_/p/C6wD2iHOLcP/?img_index=1\n15\n\nBuyer-supplier relationships refer to commercial transactions between organizations for the purchase and supply of goods or services.\nBuyer-Supplier Partner\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nHere you may join another company and agree to use each other as the go-to supplier/buyer for a product..\n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a joint venture (you don’t have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\nIntel and Lenovo: Lenovo uses Intel microprocessors in all of their computers. By doing this, they have been able to ensure consistent quality in their products, create a more efficient supply chain, and possibly have saved money through the negotiation process. \nBusinesses in the bazar probably buy all their items from one place. They could be on an automatic schedule with their suppliers or they have built relationships and can easily order whenever they need. They don’t need to research many different suppliers every time they need new products. They know what they are getting each time from the same person/company. \n\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a buyer-supplier partnership? \nCost saving\nTime saving\nIt will make things faster and easier\nYou can get a better deal\nYou will have same suppliers that can lead to consistent quality\nYou can trust each other because of a long term relationship\n\n16\n\nHOW ARE PARTNERS PAID?\n3-5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: How are partners paid?\nPotential answer:\nThere is no specific way that a partner is supposed to get paid. It will all depend on your agreement. \nSome partners are owners, not employees, so they don't get a paycheck. Each partner receives a share of the profits and losses of the business each year. Payments are made based on the partnership agreement.\nPartnerships use a partnership agreement to clarify the relationship between the partners, the roles and responsibilities of the partners, and their respective shares in the profits or losses of the partnership. \nThere are some partnerships that are paid monthly or at the time that a product or service is delivered. Making the partnership might allow for a discount or reliability (consistent on time delivery without having to go through the process of ordering, for example).\nSometimes they don’t get paid. They just share in mutually beneficial activities.\n\n\n17\n\nWHAT PARTNERS SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR?\n15 minutes: Activity\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nBased on the gaps we have identified and the different types of partnerships we have discussed, who should you partner with? Try to be specific and think of people or organizations you might want to reach out to with the hopes of making some type of agreement. \nShare the Partnership Activity from the drive. \nEntrepreneurs should work individually \n\n5 minutes: Share and recap\nAsk them to share and then wrap up with final thoughts including:\nFind a partner that can bring skills and experience to the business. \nFind a partner that shares your values, entrepreneurial spirit, and vision.\nLook for a partner without a lot of personal baggage.\nFind a partner that can offer resources and credibility to your business.\nChoose a partner that is financially stable.\n\n18\n\nOptimization and economies scale.\nReduction of risk.\nAcquisition of needed resources.\n\n\n\nPARTNERSHIP GOALS\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\n\nOptimization and economy of scale: The most basic form of partnership or buyer-supplier relationship is designed to optimize the allocation of resources and activities. It is illogical for a company to own all resources or perform every activity by itself. Optimization and economy of scale partnerships are usually formed to reduce costs, and often involve outsourcing or sharing infrastructure.\nReduction of risk and uncertainty: Partnerships can help reduce risk in a competitive environment characterized by uncertainty. It is not unusual for competitors to form a strategic alliance in one area while competing in another. Blu-ray, for example, is an optical disc format jointly developed by a group of the world’s leading consumer electronics, personal computer, and media manufacturers. The group cooperated to bring Blu-ray technology to market, yet individual members compete in selling their own Blu-ray products.\nAcquisition of particular resources and activities: Few companies own all the resources or perform all the activities described by their business models. Rather, they extend their own capabilities by relying on other firms to furnish particular resources or perform certain activities. Such partnerships can be motivated by needs to acquire knowledge, licenses, or access to customers. A mobile phone manufacturer, for example, may license an operating system for its handsets rather than developing one in-house. An insurer may choose to rely on independent brokers to sell its policies rather than develop its own sales force.\n\n19\n\nComplete the tool to help you identify and fill your business gaps. \n\nIdentify possible key partners to help fill gaps.\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n20\n\n\nTHANK YOU\nANY QUESTIONS?\n21\n"
