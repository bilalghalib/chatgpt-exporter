      "content": "The questions related to purpose and someone's \"why\" generally explore their motivations, values, goals, and the meaning they derive from their work or the impact they are trying to create. Based on this, the following questions from your list are most related to purpose and someone's \"why\":\n\n1. **New solution, same problem: Alternate Origin Story**: This question digs into the purpose and motivation behind their venture and invites reflection on what they are truly trying to achieve or solve.\n\n2. **Values**: This question directly asks about the core values of their venture, which are fundamental to understanding someone's \"why\".\n\n3. **Learning Goals**: The personal and professional learning goals can reflect their purpose and the direction they want to head in their career.\n\n4. **Obstacles and Challenges**: This question can provide insights into the individual's purpose by exploring what they view as the biggest challenges to their enterprise. Their response can give clues about what they care about most in their work.\n\n5. **Growth Areas**: By asking about their direct involvement in the growth and development of their enterprise, this question can reveal where their passion and purpose lies within their work.\n\n6. **Impact**: Measuring social impact is inherently connected to the purpose of a social enterprise. This question directly relates to their \"why\" by exploring the outcomes they hope to achieve.\n\n7. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Understanding how they engage with stakeholders and how they envision this in the future can reveal a lot about their underlying purpose and goals.\n\n8. **Well-being and Growth Insights**: Reflecting on personal growth as a social entrepreneur can reveal insights about what drives and fulfills them, providing a glimpse into their \"why\".\n\nThe rest of the questions are more focused on specific areas of learning, skills, and collaboration, which, while important, are not as directly tied to purpose or someone's \"why\".",
