We refer to our presentation to your good self and the technical staff followed by several meetings and site visits to the pump stations near Medical City and Al Ziyut factory in Baghdad and the technical information provided by your technical staff. We are honored to submit our financial and technical offer for the above project, we are confident that our proposed technology, equipment, and services will meet your requirements.\n2- STATEMENTOFPROBLEMANDPROPOSEDSOLUTION\nCurrently, the Medical City pump station discharges screened (coarse screen) raw wastewater to the Tigris River. This has created public health and environmental concerns. The Municipality has committed to evaluating measures that could be taken to alleviate these issues that could be built within a very tight space constrains.\nUltimately, the Municipality would like to treat this wastewater to meet the national standards for discharge.\nThis proposal is to provide a solution for treating the wastewater discharges with minimum footprint, by providing secondary level treatment for 150,000 m3/d on average and up to 182,000 m3/d for peak dry weather flow of an assumed normal domestic strength and without inhibitory chemical constituents. This solution will also provide treatment by settling and disinfection for sanitary and storm water (combined flow) up to 900,000 m3/d , which is the assumed capacity of existing pump station.\nThe potential treatment site is very constrained because of the highly developed nature of this portion of Baghdad. The Municipality prefers a treatment system that is compact to avoid having to acquire valuable land and demolishing nearby buildings. The proposed solution presented in this proposal requires a maximum of 20% of the land required by a conventional activated sludge plant without reduction in capacity and effect treated discharge limits. Also, the proposed solution is price competitive to conventional treatment.\nIt is with these objectives that this proposal was assembled.\n 3- DISCRIPTIOIN OF THE TECHNOLOGY\nThe proposed design is a dual shaft treatment system, using the Water Engineering Technologies (WET), a US based consulting firm patented Treatment Shaft system. This system consists of two circular reinforced concrete shafts that are relatively deep, reducing the land area required. Shaft 1 provides primary sedimentation utilizing solids contact enhanced primary treatment and skimming, and Shaft 2 provides the biological treatment to achieve secondary treatment. Shaft 2 combines many available treatment components usually built separately with conventional systems but combined in a unique pattern that provides compact and simpler system without compromising treated water quality discharges. This combined with the deeper structures dramatically reduces its size and reduces its cost due to its simplicity.\nThe proposed design concept is to treat all flows delivered by the Medical City sewer System pump station, currently assumed to be approximately 900,000 m3/d, using preliminary treatment (fine screening and grit removal) followed by primary settling.\nPrimary effluent above 182,000 m3/d will be chlorinated and discharged to the Tigris River.\nPrimary effluent below 182,000 m3/d (assumed to be the peak dry weather flow) will be treated using conventional activated sludge for CBOD removal with the final effluent being clarified using dissolved air flotation to reduce land requirements and finally chlorinated using sodium hypochlorite before discharge to the river.\nSolids removed from the screening and grit removal steps will be washed to remove organics and dried before it is sent to landfill. Primary settled solids and skimming, as well as secondary sludge, will be gravity thickened and then dewatered using presses for transport to further treatment off site or disposal.\nMost wastewater treatment plants consist of a series of shallow, horizontal tanks that occupy large parcels of land. Where land is available building such a compact system will allow developing the land for other useful uses such green land or additional development. WET, has developed, patented, and constructed a system that uses deep tanks, called Treatment Shafts, that minimize the land area required for tanks governed by volume by making the tanks deeper using regular shaft construction techniques available for underground construction such as deep excavations for high rise buildings.\nOne of the more land consuming components of wastewater treatment plants is clarification by gravity settling. While conceptually and operationally simple their design is governed by overflow rates that lead to large tanks. The proposed system allows an increase in the overflow rate in the primary clarification portion of the system. Field testing in other locations has shown that this has a minor impact on performance. Secondary clarification will be replaced by two-level, stacked, dissolved air flotation units which can achieve solids removal approximately equivalent or higher than gravity settling.\n\n 4- ADVANTAGES USING TREATMENT SHAFT\n1. The proposed process utilizes equipment commonly used in wastewater treatment with similar performance levels.\n2. The process, by making the tanks relatively deep, using processes that consume less land, and stacking the DAF’s used for final solids removal will reduce the final footprint by over 75% compared to conventional systems.\n3. The proposed process does not incorporate on-site digestion, composting, drying bed or sterilization of the produced sludge which consumes precious land.\n4. The simplicity of the process also allows reduced capital cost and treatment cost.\n5. The proposed process could be implemented in stages giving the Municipality the benefit of preliminary, primary treatment and disinfection at an early date.\n6. The proposed process may be readily upgraded to provide higher levels of treatment, if desired or required, at a future date.\n7. The system could treat very high rates of flows that are generated by rain flows.\n8. Dewatered and undigested sludge contains more beneficial organic material than digested sludge. Off-site stabilization, if desired or required, reduces land requirements at the proposed site.\n5- ASSUMPTIONS\n5-1 City Pump Station – Medical City\nMembers of our team toured the existing pump station and based on that tour and information provided to us we have made certain assumptions regarding the pump station as follows:\n● The Municipality will pump wastewater up to the elevation required – approximately 36 meters above sea level. The Municipality will continue to maintain operation and provide prime power and backup power for the pump station.\n● The existing pump station has coarse screening (approx. 75mm opening).\n● The Municipality will meter the pump station flow and transmit a 4-20 may signal to the future control building to integrate both the pumps station and treatment plant controls.\n● The six current pumps can deliver approximately 900,000 m3/d by our calculations based on the total pumps power rating (kW), with the largest unit out of service and an assumed head on the pumps of 15 meters. This is assumed to be the maximum instantaneous flow.\n\n 5-2 Site Conditions\nOur team has assumed that the site provided for the proposed wastewater treatment plant will be cleared by the Municipality prior to construction contractor’s occupation of the site for construction and that:\n● The site does not contain hazardous materials.\n● The water table is 2 to 3 m below ground surface. No artesian water table.\n● Soil conditions are expected to be silty clay with sand content increasing below 15 m depth.\n● No major underground utilities or structures are in the way of the use of the site to a depth of 30 meters. If any the Municipality will arrange for removal prior to mobilization.\n● The team will assess the sewer line that connects the pump station to the outfall at the river. Based on the sewer condition, it may require rehabilitation or replacement. In this case the Municipality will be providing a functional sewer line to either rehabilitate or replace the pipeline with a new pipe.\n5-3 Design Flows and Quality\nFrom the perspective of process design and equipment selection the current and future wastewater flows and character prior to confirm costing of the project. We will assist the Municipality in defining the data needed and review the data provided. For purposes of this proposal, we have made certain assumptions, which are believed to be realistic, based on the information available at the time of this proposal, as follows:\n● The assumed average daily flow is 150,000 m3/d for sanitary wastewater and 182,000 m3/d is the maximum sanitary wastewater flow that must receive secondary treatment.\n● For average and maximum sanitary wastewater concentrations for BOD, TSS, TKN, ammonia, and phosphorus in mg/l we have used 200, 200, 40, 15 and 6 for average respectively and for daily maximum we have used 300, 300, 50, 20 and 9 respectively.\n● It is assumed the Municipality will manage wastewater inflows into the system served by the proposed plant to eliminate toxic discharges (of particular concern in a medical area is quaternary ammonium compounds or alkylamines used as disinfectants) or those that will interfere with the plant’s operation (particularly, surfactants that will inhibit oxygen transfer or cause foaming, and\n\nstearic acid from animal products that can create stearates that will plug pipes).\n● The maximum flow rate (sanitary and storm water) to be treated using primary treatment and disinfection is assumed to be 900,000 m3/d.\n● Plant design should not preclude nutrient removal and tertiary treatment. 5-4 Basic Design Criteria\nDevelopment of technical criteria relating to raw sewage quality and quantity and desired effluent quality, both current and future, will be determined by the Municipality based on its records. Our team will review the data and will recommend additional data gathering if needed.\nGenerally, we have used conventional design guidelines and standards to guide our process and equipment sizing. We have also relied on manufacturer specific design information. The core technology is the patented Treatment Shaft technology as developed by Dr. Ghalib of our team. Since it is site specific, our team will pilot test this technology using effluent from the pump station to determine design criteria.\nOur team has developed this proposal based on many assumptions and without field testing to allow optimization. We believe that the deep shaft technology could be used throughout Iraq particularly if it optimized to local conditions. Experience showed that a deeper but smaller diameter settling shaft dependent on sludge blanket flocculation will perform better than larger shallower structures. We will utilize a brief series of tests using actual wastewater from the Medical City pump station to be conducted to establish the most efficient design parameters.
