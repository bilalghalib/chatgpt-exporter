Add a short **Risks & Mitigations** box at the end of Section 10 (three bullets max).\n\nIf you want, I can quickly renumber/retitle those sections in your doc text.",

      "content": "The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.",

      "content": "Short answer: go with **the “(3).md” version**. It’s clearer on structure, reads less “AI-ish,” and matches the TOR deliverables best. Here’s why (w/ receipts):\n\n**1) Clearer, more navigable structure**\n- The “(3).md” file’s TOC cleanly sequences Delivery → Materials → MEL → Feedback → Packaging → Job Linkage → Next Steps, so a reviewer can jump straight to agendas, materials, and evidence. fileciteturn1file0  \n- The day-by-day agenda and “Key Moments” are fully expanded with concrete timings, outputs, and decisions captured (e.g., ΔU×ΔT→ΔkWh ROI debate), which improves scannability. fileciteturn1file10turn1file15turn1file18\n\n**2) Less “AI-sounding,” more concrete**\n- It leans on specifics (IR warm-up time, photo-log protocol, tariff bands, file-naming) instead of abstractions, which gives it a human, field-tested tone. fileciteturn1file12  \n- The “Evidence mini-summary” and “One-clear-takeaway” closure show restraint and signal editorial judgment rather than boilerplate. fileciteturn1file11\n\n**3) Best alignment with the TOR’s Output-3 requirements**\n- TOR asks for a **ToT activity report with agendas, materials, and participant feedback**. “(3).md” explicitly provides:  \n  – **Agendas** (section 4.2) fileciteturn1file10  \n  – **Materials produced** (section 5, with trainer files, workbook, homework packs) fileciteturn1file18  \n  – **Participant feedback** (dedicated section + annex flow) fileciteturn1file0  \n  TOR excerpt for reference. fileciteturn1file2\n\n**4) Job-placement linkage is more operational**\n- “(3).md” spells out sector inputs for the solar module and a practical **engagement window** (piggybacking on the design-competition) rather than vague intent. fileciteturn1file19\n\n**5) Editorial polish for reviewers**\n- “(3).md” carries through the same spine you’ve used with ITC before (Learn→Apply→Sell, decision trees, banded tariffs), which creates continuity and makes validation easier for the same desk officer. fileciteturn1file11turn1file13\n\n---\n\n### Two gaps to close (to 100% match the TOR language)\nThe TOR also wants, beyond the ToT report:  \n1) **Internship/Apprenticeship/Job-Shadowing Framework with implementation guidelines**  \n2) **A sustainability plan** for long-term practical learning opportunities. fileciteturn1file2\n\nYou’ve got strong **Job Placement Linkage** content, but it would help to package two short, TOR-named boxes:\n\n- **“Internship/Apprenticeship/Job-Shadowing Framework (Implementation Guide)”**  \n  Add a 1-pager with: partner types, matching criteria, minimum evidence (photo log + supervisor note), safety/PPE checklist, reporting template, and a 2-week cadence for check-ins. Cite the “Engagement Window” as the first activation. fileciteturn1file19\n\n- **“Sustainability Plan for ToT & Practical Learning”**  \n  Bullet the WhatsApp cadence, twice-yearly trainer convenings, supplier directory upkeep, and ownership of the EN/AR package + decision-tree maintenance. (You already imply these in Next Steps—just title and group them per TOR.) fileciteturn1file19\n\n---\n\n### Micro-edits to reduce any lingering “AI vibe”\n- Replace metaphors with actions (e.g., “Coalition of creators” → “Trainer working group and peer hotline”). fileciteturn1file17  \n- Tighten heading nouns (e.g., “Actions by Intentions” → “Service-First Framing (Intent & Public Benefit)”). fileciteturn1file13  \n- Fix tiny typos (“Workbook sheet | **D y**” → “Day”). fileciteturn1file18\n\nIf you want, I can drop in those two TOR-named boxes and a quick copy-edit pass on “(3).md” next.",

      "content": "The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.",

[Conclusion & Next Steps](#10-conclusion--next-steps)\n\n---\n\n## 1) Framework Purpose & Context\nMosul’s green housing sector faces a **skills-to-employment gap**: CVs aren’t trusted, practical trials dominate hiring, and graduates struggle to show evidence of competence. This framework creates **low-risk, evidence-building pathways** from training to jobs or entrepreneurship, tailored to three distinct outcomes (Insulation → entrepreneurship; Solar → employment; Architecture → design/awareness leadership). fileciteturn3file0\n\n---\n\n## 2) Career Pathway Design\n\n### 2.1 Pathway Levels (Least → Most Commitment)\n| Pathway | Duration | Structure | Stipend? |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Site Visit** | 1 day | Shadow ustādh on active project | No |\n| **Job Shadowing** | 1–2 weeks (2–3 d/wk) | Follow full workflow end-to-end | Small (5–10k IQD/day if possible) |\n| **Apprenticeship** | 1–3 months (3 d/wk) | Supervised hands-on tasks; draft proposals | Shared: IP/ITC + company |\n| **Internship** | 1 month FT | Lead a small project with mentor oversight | 100–150k IQD total | fileciteturn3file17\n\n### 2.2 Module-Specific Pathways\n**Insulation (Entrepreneurship):** shadow → supervised assessments → solo pilot retrofit + portfolio (before/after, bills, testimonial). Build supplier and customer relationships. **Success:** 1 paid retrofit within 3 months + 3 leads. fileciteturn3file14\n\n**Solar (Employment):** site visit → job shadow 1–2 weeks → 1–2 month apprenticeship → trial hire (with subsidy) → full hire if competent; portfolio: 3–5 installs. fileciteturn3file17\n\n**Architecture (Design/Awareness):** shadow senior architect → design apprenticeship on a real client → solo design during training → **post-training design competition** (shared model home) → showcase. Invite bosses to finals to shift mindsets. fileciteturn3file6\n\n### 2.3 De-Risking Hiring: The Salary Subsidy Model\nEmployers hesitate to hire unproven grads. **Solution:** IP/ITC covers months 1–2 (50k IQD/mo), employer covers supervision in-kind and converts Month 3+ if competent (150–300k IQD/mo). Budget: **10 trainees × 100k IQD = 1,000,000 IQD (~$700)**. fileciteturn3file6\n\n### 2.4 Supplier & Customer Activation (during training)\n- **Live supplier calls in class** (materials, pricing, specs) → build relationships before graduation.  \n- **Supplier directory & spec sheets** issued in the workbook.  \n- **Quotation drills**: teams request two quotes and compare on spec/quality, not just price.  \n- **Customer-facing micro-pitches**: trainees practice a 90-second pitch tied to their numbers page (U-value → kWh → ROI).  \nThis cements market linkage as part of pedagogy, not an afterthought. fileciteturn3file12\n\n### 2.5 Immediate Post-Training Activation (Day 0–30)\n- **Day 0:** trainees publish a “I’m available for…” post + portfolio one-pager; trainers share/endorse.  \n- **Week 1:** WhatsApp matching: mentors post slots; 10-min hands test; trilateral agreement signed.  \n- **Weeks 2–4:** supervised tasks + weekly check-ins; **at least one paid micro-task** (e.g., thermal paint roof, inverter commissioning assist) to seed confidence and credibility. fileciteturn3file8\n\n---\n\n## 3) Placement Process\nStep-by-step ASCII flows for Matchmaking → Onboarding → Supervised Work are preserved; see section for details (WhatsApp posting, portfolio shortlisting, hands test, agreement, weekly check-ins, documentation). fileciteturn3file8\n\n---\n\n## 4) Roles & Responsibilities\nClear trilateral commitments (IP, Mentor/Employer, Trainee) including **weekly 15-min check-ins**, safety, and portfolio outputs. fileciteturn3file10\n\n---\n\n## 5) Implementation Templates\nIncluded: **1-page portfolio**, **Trilateral Agreement**, **Learning Plan**, **Evaluation Rubric**, **Safety Checklist** (all corrected for markdown blocks and headings). fileciteturn3file11\n\n---\n\n## 6) Quality Assurance\n\n### 6.1 Monitoring Indicators\n(Keep your indicator table as is.) fileciteturn3file11\n\n### 6.2 Trainer On-Site QA & Credibility Protocol\nTo build **customer trust** and reduce early-career risk:\n1. **Trainer presence on the trainee’s first live job** (insulation or solar) for final QA checklist and client handover.  \n2. **Co-signature** on the invoice/proposal to confer credibility.  \n3. **Numbers page validation** (U-value → kWh → ROI) filed into trainee portfolio and shared with IP.  \n4. **Satisfied-client testimonial** captured on video/photo for portfolio + social proof.  \nThis protocol turns the first jobs into **trust-building moments** for the whole market. fileciteturn3file12\n\n---\n\n## 7) Partner Directory\nSector-wise, contact-ready list (solar companies, material suppliers, universities, heritage organizations) with estimated placement capacity **20–30 slots** for the pilot. fileciteturn3file19\n\n---\n\n## 8) Pilot Plan (Nov 2025 – Mar 2026)\nCohort selection, matching, onboarding, supervised placements, and a March showcase; success and budget metrics retained. **ROI per job ≈ $222** (if 6 hires). fileciteturn3file3 fileciteturn3file9\n\n### 8.1 Green Home Festival / Job Fair — link to Output 3.2\n**Piggyback on the Output 3.2** design-competition finale to convene **suppliers, employers, trainers, trainees, and customers**: portfolio showcases, live product demos, hiring/matchmaking booths, and public talks. If 3.2 timing/budget misaligns, run a **compact market-facing gathering** with the same contacts. fileciteturn3file13\n\n---\n\n## 9) Advocacy & Awareness (Market Building)\nThe training **must** also grow the **customer base**. Recommended cadence:\n- **During training:** daily micro-content (before/after photos, short reels of “numbers page” wins) posted by trainees and re-shared by Mosul Space/ITC.  \n- **Monthly post-training:** alumni highlights + “Ask a Trainer” live Q&A.  \n- **Myth-busting series:** top misconceptions (e.g., “solar doesn’t work here”, “nothing can be done after tiles are installed”) with simple, local proofs.  \n- **Institutional advocacy:** ITC explores **expanding existing material subsidies** to include insulation; coordinate with the relevant ministry. fileciteturn3file2 fileciteturn3file6\n\n---\n\n## 10) Conclusion & Next Steps\nThis framework operationalizes a **train-to-work** pipeline tailored to Mosul’s realities—combining **supplier/customer activation**, **immediate job starts**, **trainer-backed QA**, and a **market-facing festival** to unlock hiring and entrepreneurship.  \n**Next 60 days:** finalize partner slots, run Day 0 activations, launch placements, and confirm the Output 3.2 festival integration. fileciteturn3file0\n\n---\n\n### What changed (at a glance)\n- Fixed headings, tables, and code blocks for clean markdown. fileciteturn3file0  \n- Added **Supplier & Customer Activation** (in-training) and **Immediate Post-Training Activation** (Day 0–30). fileciteturn3file12  \n- Added **Trainer On-Site QA & Credibility Protocol**. fileciteturn3file12  \n- Made the **Green Home Festival / Job Fair** explicitly tie to **Output 3.2**. fileciteturn3file13  \n- Added **Advocacy & Awareness** section to systematically build demand. fileciteturn3file2\n\nIf you want, I can also produce a **one-page summary** for stakeholders and a **checklist PDF** (Day 0 activations + on-site QA) drawn from these sections.",

      "content": "Looking at your framework document, I need to give you some honest feedback: most of what you're asking me to add is already there. The document is actually quite comprehensive. Let me break down what's covered and what could be strengthened:\nWhat's Already Solid ✓\n\nSupplier connections during training - Lines 72-80 cover this\nImmediate job activation - Lines 80-88, entire \"First Independent Project\" pathway\nTrainer site support for QA - Lines 82-86, repeated in each module section\nJob fair/festival linked to Output 3.2 - Section 8 entire, line 626 explicitly mentions coordination\nBuilding customer demand - Section 9 literally calls this \"MOST IMPORTANT\"\nAdvocacy/awareness/content creation - Lines 576-596 are dedicated to this\nTouchpoints and celebration - Covered in festival section and pilot plan\n\nMarkdown Issues (Minor)\nThe markdown is actually functional. The only \"issue\" is stylistic - you're using HTML anchor tags (<a id=\"\">) for internal links, which work fine but could be simpler. Not worth changing unless you want pure markdown.\nWhat's Missing or Weak\nHere's where I'd push back on your document:\n\nThe design competition lacks punch - You mention it briefly in the Architecture section and Festival, but given how central it is to the architecture track's success, it deserves more prominence. From the contract file, I can see you're thinking about this as a showcase moment where everyone designs the same model home. That competitive element should be more explicit.\nThe \"touchpoint\" concept is buried - You mention monthly gatherings and the Festival, but the why of the touchpoint (people come back after attempting to sell/create, share what worked/didn't, celebrate wins, get reminded of the ecosystem) isn't clear. It reads like logistics, not strategy.\nContent creation is mentioned but not operationalized - You say \"create content\" but don't specify: Are trainees filming themselves? Taking before/afters? Writing case studies? Who's editing? Who's posting? When?\nThe sequential logic could be clearer - Training → immediate project → trainer QA → festival → ongoing customer building. This cycle is there but scattered across sections.\n\nSuggested Enhancements\nWant me to create an updated version that:\n\nStrengthens the design competition framing (makes it feel like a real event, not just homework)\nAdds a clearer \"touchpoint strategy\" subsection explaining the cycle of engagement\nOperationalizes content creation (specific formats, timeline, responsibilities)\nAdds a visual/metaphor for the ecosystem (training → doing → sharing → celebrating → recruiting next wave)?\n\nOr do you want me to just leave it as-is since it technically covers everything you asked for?\nYour call - I can polish this, or I can tell you it's good enough to submit.Yeah. So the design competition, that we’re recommending that we connect it with 3.2 which is also having a design competition. So we need to call it something else, but maybe it could be Model home competition or something like that. Maybe you can come up with another name. But the idea is, to have everyone design different houses during the training for actual people and connecting them to real people. And then during so that’s actually another connection to the job job market and to, like, deepen there. Capacity. But for this, design competition or the model home, award competition or something. We want to, connect it with 3.2, which are having a design competition for a business that does retrofitting to improve, sustainability. And as long as they’re doing that, we’re suggesting we could connect it to a job fair and a sort of sustainability festival of some sort that connects all of the suppliers and all of the teams from all 3 tracks to meet each other, all of the trainers, the idea of the trainer luncheon can can connects over here We wanted to make, this a really fun and, engaging event where people can see the materials, they can learn about, what’s possible to do within the market, and then to highlight the the 2 competitions, the one for the retrofit projects from 3.2 and the model home, award competition where they’re designing based on kind of a most average or stereotypical muscle home design constraints, with the with the common budget, And then we can see if we can create, the new sort of copy paste for the ecosystem. So it’s super exciting. I would love that to happen. I really recommend it. It’s a really big part of these things, and who knows? Maybe it’ll become annual and that would be maybe one of the main touch points. You know, we’re talking about gathering the trainers twice a year. This could be one of the main ones. Touchpoint concept. Yeah. So people come back, to sell, share, create what worked and what didn’t, celebrate wins, Yeah. So, the idea is for people to after the training, go out and try to really implement within a month even, and to have the events happen around a month after the trainings or 2, and then to actually have all of the teams present. And if they made a sale, they present. Slides. They present their documentation and portfolio, pieces, because they’re all recommended to take pictures and to start that. And then also to, present if they didn’t make a sale, you know, how it went, the the kind of soft skills the issues that they confronted, and to share that and to strategize together. Content creation Yeah. So the modules themselves all have big content creation elements. So taking pictures of what you’re doing, sharing it online, is a part of the sell section to get people to break the ice and also connect online with maybe a new way of being, a new identity, Actually, a third, thing that we didn’t talk about at all here is the importance of the certificate. So going to create, at the very least, a certificate of participation that people can use to kind of identify them themselves as having some externally verifiable credentialing that they have some skills in this field. So that’s another really important element that is not in this framework. Okay. Yeah. Can you, bring all of that together and let me know how to fix it. Or, actually just return the whole, MD file, updated. With the these insights.",
