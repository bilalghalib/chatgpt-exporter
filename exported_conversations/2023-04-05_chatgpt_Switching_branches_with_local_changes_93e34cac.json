      "content": "This error message suggests that you have made changes to the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files, but you are trying to switch branches before committing or stashing these changes. \n\nTo fix this issue, you can either commit the changes or stash them before switching to the new branch. Here are the steps to stash your changes:\n\n1. Run `git stash` command. This will save your changes in a temporary area.\n2. Switch to the new branch using `git checkout` command.\n3. Retrieve your changes from the stash using `git stash apply` command.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to discard your local changes, you can run `git reset --hard` command. This will remove all the changes you made and reset your repository to the state of the last commit. However, be cautious as this will erase all the changes you made since the last commit.",
