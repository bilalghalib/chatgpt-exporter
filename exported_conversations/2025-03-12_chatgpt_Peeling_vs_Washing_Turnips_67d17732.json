      "content": "If your turnips are not organic, peeling them is generally a good idea to remove any pesticide residues, wax coatings, or contaminants that may be on the skin. However, if you prefer to keep the peel for its fiber and nutrients, you can wash them thoroughly with a vegetable brush under running water, and optionally soak them in a vinegar-water solution (1 part vinegar to 3 parts water) for a few minutes to help remove residues. Peeling is especially recommended if the skin looks tough, waxy, or dirty.",
