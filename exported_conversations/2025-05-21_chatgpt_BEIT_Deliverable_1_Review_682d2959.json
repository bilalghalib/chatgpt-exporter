The timeline between the workplan and the ToR deliverables meant that my stakeholder analysis was still ongoing and overlapping; insha’allah, the first deliverable was the only one with this issue. \r\n\r\nYou can see the document describing the stakeholder analysis and the of insights generated as well as an overview of the days in the attached file: BEIT Stakeholder Mapping  Deliverable 1 For Review.docx\r\n\r\nOur documents and strategy are being co-designed through stakeholder meetups, and this iterative development is facilitated by the call I had today with Dr. Nasih. Neither the Facilitation Guide nor the BEIT Solar Energy Facilitation Guide Deliverable 1 Draft.docx \r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in getting closer to the raw data, you can see the qualitative and quantitative maps here: Stakeholder Meetup Summaries.xlsx\r\nSimilarly – in a different more readable stype, you can see it in Interviews Summary\r\n\r\nLastly for tonight there’s the curriculum comparison document which goes through KESK/Mosul Solar/Our original work to identify the concept space and determine if our new training had enough coverage. \r\n\r\nI hope you’re both doing well, and talk to you soon. Salam 😊 \r",

      "content": "Here’s a revised version of your message that keeps the tone warm, collaborative, and non-blaming, while improving clarity and flow. I’ve smoothed transitions, gently clarified the overlap issue, and polished for tone:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** BEIT Deliverable 1 – Stakeholder Mapping (Draft for Review)\n\n**Salam Hanaa and Salih,**  \nI hope you’re both doing well, insha’Allah.\n\nApologies for the delay in sending this over — I wanted to share the draft of our first deliverable with you. Due to the timing between the workplan and the Terms of Reference, the stakeholder analysis process was still in progress while I was drafting this. Insha’Allah, this will be the only deliverable with such overlap.\n\nAttached, you’ll find:  \n📄 **BEIT Stakeholder Mapping Deliverable 1 – For Review**  \nThis document outlines the stakeholder engagement process, a synthesis of the insights generated, and an overview of the evolving training structure.\n\nAs you know, our approach is being co-developed through ongoing discussions and meetups with local stakeholders. Today's call with Dr. Nasih was especially helpful in moving this forward. This iterative process is also shaping both the Facilitation Guide and the BEIT Solar Energy Facilitation Guide Draft.\n\nIf you'd like to explore the source material more closely:  \n📊 **Stakeholder Meetup Summaries.xlsx** – includes both qualitative and quantitative notes  \n📋 **Interviews Summary** – a more readable format of the key takeaways\n\nAlso included:  \n📚 **Curriculum Comparison Document** – which maps out the conceptual coverage across KESK, Mosul Solar, and our original work to ensure alignment and identify gaps.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts, and grateful for your support as we move forward together.\n\n**Warm regards and salam,**  \nBilal 😊\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a version in formal Arabic, or if you're preparing a more polished one for external sharing.",
