Yeah, made me feel irrelevant in a really good way. There needs to be a word for like positively irrelevant. Maybe it's a kind of humility. No, no. Being okay with like your own irrelevance is humility, right? That's true, but this is like action. This is an active thing that I aim at in my life, which is to not plug everything into me, but instead plug everything into itself. It's a bit like... What do you call it? Mise en place? It's like your... Sat dresser? It's like putting all the pieces on the stage together and then not actually being on the stage for the play. Is that some French thing? Is that a rule? Is that like the person's shots? I don't know what it means. Sorry, mise en place means putting things in place, and it refers to the point in movie making where things are put into place. Or in the theatre. Does it sound like mise en scène? Thank you! Yes. Mise en rouge? I think so. Yeah, but yeah, close. Mise en scène. Yes, yeah. So it's like, I think it's a dresser then? No, no, it's... It's a state of the stage where everything is ready? It's putting all the ingredients of what your vision is together and letting it be. It's a little tricky to kind of... When is this word used? What's the context? It's theatre and film. No, in order of like a sentence. Oh, well, it's more like a term for this act. So it's an action? Yeah, it's a skill, an action. So it's like if you're a director, it's like, alright, we're going to get this set up. We're going to work on mise en scène. Yeah, so we have the song so we know what it feels like. So that could be everything that goes into that scene. From the mood it's going to convey, to the emotions, to the predispositions, to the illusions that might lurk in the background. Stop connecting. Yeah, and I think the thing is, it's similar to that, but the difference is that I'm not trying to be like directorial. It's not like I'm like, oh, I know exactly the kind of vision that I want to have, or something like that. I think that's why it really works, because even if a director does that, everyone's still going to experience it differently. The audience is going to have... Maybe each person is going to bring something different to the experience of the play, or the scene that worked out. So do you want to do a quick recap, or are you still going for the things that were positive? No, I'll just do that one. So the one I failed at was about trusting that my needs or desires like fit in. And the one that I succeeded at was about making myself irrelevant in a good way. I like all these nameless values. It's cool that we don't have an answer to those. It's not like integrity or honesty. But you can feel it. It really has a sense that that is something. There's probably a word for it in German. That was really cool. Just hearing people tell me new words in German that can capture precisely these unspeakable emotions. What are the values? Your friend. Lubna. Hamid? Yeah, Lubna. A couple of really good ones that I forgot now. I need to message her. Do you have a value that you failed at or succeeded at? You don't have to. It will add to your failures though. We'll go down to your permanent record. Not necessarily, if that's not one of the values. What? You can choose this? We're aggressively pluralist here. Violently pluralist. Imagine there's no heaven. Give us time, we're imagining. I had like a four and a half hour breakfast. That's pretty good. Which was great. And just the taking a lot of time doing completely meaningless things, things I would consider meaningless on a given day where I have specific goals set for the day was really great. So the amount of time I played with a cat, like my friend's cat, made me very happy and also didn't produce anything other than that. Even though I had a lot of things I kind of wanted to do, but then all that became very unimportant when I decided early on in the day to have this long breakfast and not worry about any of that and play with the cat as long as I felt like it and the cat felt like it. That's good to hear. Consensual. This is so taboo. Consensual. It was consensual play. Although stopping play was not consensual because the cat did not want me to leave. I'm really worried about him. I haven't seen him all day. I've bonded really quickly with his cat. And that's really strange for me. So just taking that time and taking it slow and taking it easy was probably the good. And maybe I took it too easy because I can't really recall things I didn't live up to which might be one of the things that perhaps I wasn't thinking deeply enough about the day and I'm not thinking deeply enough about it. You could have also just had a perfect day. Which, which, yeah, right? That would be too odd. But yeah, it was good. A lot of it was quite good. And also very unremarkable. But good. Sorry. Some of it was stealthed with the ball. I don't know if he approves of it. Presence. I feel like Winnie Tang has names for both the values, the unremarkable value and the slow breakfast value. I don't remember where they are though. Who is? Oh yeah, I'm all about the idleness. Moussa, that's the German word. Yeah. Who has these names? Winnie Tang is a Chinese-American philosopher that I really like. And Boca is writing. Kind of like the other part is kind of a little bit like the wabi-sabi kind of thing. A little bit, like being happy with not having something like concrete or pretty or perfect or like too high ideal, too high standards. Appreciating unremarkableness. I think it's more like the Daoist useless thing. Daoist what? In the Changsha. Have you heard of the Changsha? He talks about the uselessness of an old tree that no one could cut into lumber. And the tree will last because no one has any use for it. I'm a big fan of Changsha. I loved it though when I read it before. It's so funny too. Yeah, that's my favorite. Part about the language of birds. It's like, when you talk to me, Boca, how do I, do you really make any sense? Like maybe you're just making sounds. It's like, what if I just made sounds too? Nice. I spend a lot of time with birds as well in pursuit of idleness. That's great. I went on a bit of a rant last time I saw Bello about laziness. Oh yeah you did. I glorify it. You might like this book. It's called The Importance of Living. It has chapters called On Lying in Bed. Really? It's called The Importance of Living. Wow, this sounds like your book. Or Observing Two Big Ladies. Observing Two Big Ladies? Really? Lying in Bed and Observing Two Big Ladies? At the same time. I really like that. It's a wonderful book. It's wonderful. Those are good values. Observing Two Big Ladies. What was it on the... The Importance of Living. Go Observe More Big Ladies. To Do. Check. You ready to check them out? They have to be. No. Well, do you guys find Big Ladies a good value? Do it.\", 'segments': \\[{'id': 0, 'seek': 0, 'start': 2.82, 'end': 8.7, 'text': ' And so lashing it through and kind of like get along, like...', 'tokens': \\[50364, 400, 370, 2439, 571, 309, 807,

Yeah, made me feel irrelevant in a really good way. There needs to be a word for like positively irrelevant. Maybe it's a kind of humility. No, no. Being okay with like your own irrelevance is humility, right? That's true, but this is like action. This is an active thing that I aim at in my life, which is to not plug everything into me, but instead plug everything into itself. It's a bit like... What do you call it? Mise en place? It's like your... Sat dresser? It's like putting all the pieces on the stage together and then not actually being on the stage for the play. Is that some French thing? Is that a rule? Is that like the person's shots? I don't know what it means. Sorry, mise en place means putting things in place, and it refers to the point in movie making where things are put into place. Or in the theatre. Does it sound like mise en scène? Thank you! Yes. Mise en rouge? I think so. Yeah, but yeah, close. Mise en scène. Yes, yeah. So it's like, I think it's a dresser then? No, no, it's... It's a state of the stage where everything is ready? It's putting all the ingredients of what your vision is together and letting it be. It's a little tricky to kind of... When is this word used? What's the context? It's theatre and film. No, in order of like a sentence. Oh, well, it's more like a term for this act. So it's an action? Yeah, it's a skill, an action. So it's like if you're a director, it's like, alright, we're going to get this set up. We're going to work on mise en scène. Yeah, so we have the song so we know what it feels like. So that could be everything that goes into that scene. From the mood it's going to convey, to the emotions, to the predispositions, to the illusions that might lurk in the background. Stop connecting. Yeah, and I think the thing is, it's similar to that, but the difference is that I'm not trying to be like directorial. It's not like I'm like, oh, I know exactly the kind of vision that I want to have, or something like that. I think that's why it really works, because even if a director does that, everyone's still going to experience it differently. The audience is going to have... Maybe each person is going to bring something different to the experience of the play, or the scene that worked out. So do you want to do a quick recap, or are you still going for the things that were positive? No, I'll just do that one. So the one I failed at was about trusting that my needs or desires like fit in. And the one that I succeeded at was about making myself irrelevant in a good way. I like all these nameless values. It's cool that we don't have an answer to those. It's not like integrity or honesty. But you can feel it. It really has a sense that that is something. There's probably a word for it in German. That was really cool. Just hearing people tell me new words in German that can capture precisely these unspeakable emotions. What are the values? Your friend. Lubna. Hamid? Yeah, Lubna. A couple of really good ones that I forgot now. I need to message her. Do you have a value that you failed at or succeeded at? You don't have to. It will add to your failures though. We'll go down to your permanent record. Not necessarily, if that's not one of the values. What? You can choose this? We're aggressively pluralist here. Violently pluralist. Imagine there's no heaven. Give us time, we're imagining. I had like a four and a half hour breakfast. That's pretty good. Which was great. And just the taking a lot of time doing completely meaningless things, things I would consider meaningless on a given day where I have specific goals set for the day was really great. So the amount of time I played with a cat, like my friend's cat, made me very happy and also didn't produce anything other than that. Even though I had a lot of things I kind of wanted to do, but then all that became very unimportant when I decided early on in the day to have this long breakfast and not worry about any of that and play with the cat as long as I felt like it and the cat felt like it. That's good to hear. Consensual. This is so taboo. Consensual. It was consensual play. Although stopping play was not consensual because the cat did not want me to leave. I'm really worried about him. I haven't seen him all day. I've bonded really quickly with his cat. And that's really strange for me. So just taking that time and taking it slow and taking it easy was probably the good. And maybe I took it too easy because I can't really recall things I didn't live up to which might be one of the things that perhaps I wasn't thinking deeply enough about the day and I'm not thinking deeply enough about it. You could have also just had a perfect day. Which, which, yeah, right? That would be too odd. But yeah, it was good. A lot of it was quite good. And also very unremarkable. But good. Sorry. Some of it was stealthed with the ball. I don't know if he approves of it. Presence. I feel like Winnie Tang has names for both the values, the unremarkable value and the slow breakfast value. I don't remember where they are though. Who is? Oh yeah, I'm all about the idleness. Moussa, that's the German word. Yeah. Who has these names? Winnie Tang is a Chinese-American philosopher that I really like. And Boca is writing. Kind of like the other part is kind of a little bit like the wabi-sabi kind of thing. A little bit, like being happy with not having something like concrete or pretty or perfect or like too high ideal, too high standards. Appreciating unremarkableness. I think it's more like the Daoist useless thing. Daoist what? In the Changsha. Have you heard of the Changsha? He talks about the uselessness of an old tree that no one could cut into lumber. And the tree will last because no one has any use for it. I'm a big fan of Changsha. I loved it though when I read it before. It's so funny too. Yeah, that's my favorite. Part about the language of birds. It's like, when you talk to me, Boca, how do I, do you really make any sense? Like maybe you're just making sounds. It's like, what if I just made sounds too? Nice. I spend a lot of time with birds as well in pursuit of idleness. That's great. I went on a bit of a rant last time I saw Bello about laziness. Oh yeah you did. I glorify it. You might like this book. It's called The Importance of Living. It has chapters called On Lying in Bed. Really? It's called The Importance of Living. Wow, this sounds like your book. Or Observing Two Big Ladies. Observing Two Big Ladies? Really? Lying in Bed and Observing Two Big Ladies? At the same time. I really like that. It's a wonderful book. It's wonderful. Those are good values. Observing Two Big Ladies. What was it on the... The Importance of Living. Go Observe More Big Ladies. To Do. Check. You ready to check them out? They have to be. No. Well, do you guys find Big Ladies a good value? Do it.\", 'segments': \\[{'id': 0, 'seek': 0, 'start': 2.82, 'end': 8.7, 'text': ' And so lashing it through and kind of like get along, like...', 'tokens': \\[50364, 400, 370, 2439, 571, 309, 807,
