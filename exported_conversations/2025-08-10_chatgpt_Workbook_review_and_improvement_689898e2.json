do we need station rotations?- how do we do pain->price matrix, how do we do it not reach it? empathy map, where do we do that is it in our workbook?  yeah, i like which principle might fit your client?  for day two 18 - what do you mean take proof photos during calls?\" yeah, i guess we an remove material theory...  Day 3 what's a TCO and can you give me a tco template should it be in our workbook? What's phase 1 vs phase 2 decision matrix in day 3 slide 15, not sure what that is can you give more details, maybe you can give for all changes header and body description so it's easy to copy and paste?  day 4 we can't ensure client is present, we're going to try - maybe over whatsapp messages, maybe pretending to take on the persona of the client.  how do we do th ecodesign witht he client? IEQ(what's ieq?) - maybe we remove technical calcs? what's the point of this day, doing the total design and showcasing the changes in total cost, where do we do BOQ / ROI for lifetime costs?  day 5 is focused on making the pitch and doing the exit assessments - show them the scoring criteria what's the evidence chain slide? can you give me the day intro slides for every day with the one thing and the title clearly described. and ok, gerat, i like the idea of psoting the client story, what does the story evolve every day? what's the main story  for each day?EditSystematically analyzed client's detailed questions about workshop design6sThe user is asking for clarification on many specific implementation details.

      "content": "The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.",
