And that would alienate some people And I'm wondering if it's also about, like, you know, Attention. Presence. And the oneness concept of in Integration rather than disintegration. You did mention some earlier that I really liked. Yeah. Different ways of seeing through trust beauty, and relationship. And each theme contains elements of ways of seeing, being, doing, and having. Perception, presence, action, and outcome. Also the relationship between gifts and generosity and blessing our money. Right? Like, if you if you have something So e you eat it, but it doesn't have it's not blessed. You might survive, but you won't thrive. Until this idea of, like, a minute being an infinite amount of time spent with your loved is how time is of blessings. And a life that is blessed is a life that's worth living and worth dying. For. Right? And just worth leaving. It's okay. You've lived it. Somehow something like that. Right? Like, I feel like all of these ideas are trying to get at something that's almost Ineffable. And I'm wondering what, like, the core word can be that Helps structure all the patterns and organizes them most coherently, elegantly, and simply. So that the frameworks look clean and are comprehensible. And also, our practical. And really transformative for businesses. And through those businesses transformative for the world. I mean, the idea is that people transformed people, people coming to work with meaning in moment. Are are, like, off gassing beauty. Because people that are living a meaningful life are perfuming the air. Around them There's just glowing, if you will. And It's very unlikely that they will be doing anything as a D service. And it's because we glow when we are in service to something greater than us, something more beautiful. And as you seek that, That's So what of transforming and continually leveling in your understanding of self and world and in what you Can do as you devote more skills and awareness and understanding of systems and This is how we start wherever we are and slowly become more and more of You know? Integrated whole into larger and larger feeling how it all interconnects, and listening to the signals of how to respond but not needing a spreadsheet to keep it all in order because you are there. You are the response. And Weird. The response and serving life, life supports that which serves life. And so you will make your living. And so that is how you can understand that your provisions have already My god. When you are in service, when you are Completely get you will get Because You are in the system of life. This is not a system of death. Even the death and decay in the collapse is a part of new life. When you let go of who you are and what you think should happen, I want to live forever. You become a cancer on this earth. Rather than thinking of the generous life. And you see animals and plants and you don't think, like, poor tree has mushrooms growing out of Oh, gross.

As a framework that also matches beauty is due, truth c and feel his love. And that I also want it to align with the Islamic principle service and falling holy in service and I like the idea of, like, beauty is witnessing, and recognizing the beauty of the natural order and wanting to align to that and to your fitra. Right? And So already need that full dispensation. And that we are here to do that. Until doing it in a way that is proper. And we're told how. Best to be in beauty just like everything else, like animals had returned to that state. And involves things like interest is like stretching the future towards you and creating these spring like ripple effect with your greed, wanting more now. And time traveling into the future rather than being in the present. And that sort of time traveling creates warps where you're not in mode. In the moment. Lost in desiring more of later. Because you want things faster, but what if you die? You'll never you'll you then like a rope tied to you through a spring. We'll cut it, and we'll create jiggle and ripple effects throughout the system. This is why interest and wanting and desiring more than you can offer in service. Holistically and completely right now. And to create a value right now. Pretending or hoping or desiring that this job or this school or this business will be able to come in the future is a lie against reality because many only exists in this present. Live reality.

Like, I Claude my business node creative studio with node co op. And it's about the light of God coming and hitting the earth. Causing things to grow, and that it's our sort of task to take that and be as careful as possible with the blessings that are full in every moment and every second because it's our hands that can corrupt them. Like an apple that grows on a tree in a field is full of delicious beauty and generous generosity from God who's in constant giving inside of the core of the earth. With the heat and the outside of the sun coming in lighting up the sky and the moon and the the seasons and all the cycles that Move and propel minerals and material and story to produce an apple that you can eat and digest and incorporate into your body versus you know, you go and all of that is happening.

I think this is one of the things that I see as the origin of our modern kind of Adam Smithian worldview is the leaving behind Then divine unitary principle in putting your Unitary principle and instead where instead of everything Going Out. From you and through society, up to be a offering to God, including you cooking for your You eating a good meal, nurture nurturing the body that you realize is get and taking care of it for the god that gave it to you on loan. And you just replace that unit unitary point, with you as a unitary And you eat until you get fat. And you want as many sexual partners as you can until you get complicated relationship dynamics. And you wanna make as much money as you can so you can have as much freedom as you can and want to be able to buy off the police, to be able to live as hedonist He is you can grow in power in these technologically empowered systems to feed that unit terry perspective. Of the self. That has been you know, created when these you know, stories. But that all started with I think, therefore, I am. And iOS Modern confusion as well as this idea that Galileo's error. Right? Like, anything that you can measure and you know, force and velocity and position is all you need, and it was very Official doesn't take into consideration the fact that people know that we have quality qualitative things. We can agree on And so I want this book to be true as well, not just Islamic. I want to be able to guide people through thought experiments to realize the truth of every single one of these elements and principles. So how can we do that? For all this dynamic concept?EditCORE SHIFT: From Unity to Fragmentation\nCopyDIVINE UNITY               SELF-CENTERED\n(Everything as offering)   (Everything as possession)\n         ↓                          ↓\n   Multiplication              Accumulation\n   Quality                     Quantity\n   Integration                 Fragmentation\n   Grace                       Control\nLet's structure truth-revealing pathways:\n\nTHE QUALITY EXPERIMENT\n\"Consider two meals...\"\n\n\nSame ingredients, same cost\nOne made with love as offering\nOne made efficiently for fuel\nWhat differs?

How does this approach feel? CopyRetryBGOkay. Let's see how the better the framing can connect all of the themes. And the stories and the attentional policies that we've gathered all the way up until now. The story iOS present. Stories needed. Supporting concepts. Let's let's find a few ways that we can see the core theme of bed decazzum meta framing? And the things that I woke up being inspired by today was realizing that, there's a relationship between seeing everything as part of a whole and instrumental. Right? Like, if you Think of something as a means the end is always God. And how is that an instrument? Using God for God. As God, is God. Right? Like, it really changes the dynamic The only instrument can be towards the fleeting, the death of the action in the self Right? So you think of Someone stealing something. Right? From who and then to who? Essentially, what the crime here is the lack of acknowledgment of relationality or the togetherness. And I use the word relationality because I'm starting realize that relationship itself is Zocor. Drawn through love, and beauty as a recognition, of oneness knowing that how amazing it is to be alive and that we didn't do it and that this comes from the emergence of this unity. As Muslims would say, everything is under the mercy of God. Then relating is an integrative process of putting together oneness. It is the Active practice. T A wh I d, Tawhid in the Muslim tradition. And so Any work or any action that we take that is counter to relating or breaks ties One of the biggest quote unquote sins in the Muslim relationship is breaking the ties of kinship. Right. And that is Any way of thinking about relating that makes it about Putting things together as one For instance, like, let's say you went and you bought lighter That item will mostly contain yourself in it. I went to the store. Abstract concept. Android used money and I purchased an item. For my need. It's all inward. Versus going to the store. Or to the crafts person. Seeing their crafts witnessing their beauty, sharing time and experience honoring a lineage of Android and thousands of people. Potentially. Who have refined that craft. In some traditions, they keep a record of the history of the grass people. I learned this master who learned from this master who learned from this master. And weaving together materiality and the world and the object and the thing that you bring to your home. You know? Versus I saw this rug on Amazon. It looked cute. And it's very similar to the superficial falling in love versus the deep falling in love. Right? This person is attractive. I desire. I want. Versus we are in love. You know? And So these ideas of stories of connection of is thanks. Are so core because then it's It's very different even, like, in a macroeconomic way. Like, tariffs versus taxes versus You know? Imposing bans on one country or another. Is like saying that people can't fall in love And Yeah. So this idea of, like, relationships being are so critical as a form of Tohid? And love kind of. Maybe you can think of it as the gravitational force. That pulls things into relationships, and you can love an object because of the beauty you can love an object even more because of the story And beauty is A way of witnessing that it is like the story of the farmer trying to get a cow into their you know, garage. And he's pushing the cow and trying to pull the cow into the barn and just struggling, and the car's very stubborn. And then the car's wave comes. Puts out her hand, and lets the cow suck on her thumb, and walks into the farm. I feel like another sign of god's infinite mercy is that truth is decorated in beauty. And we're drawn towards it. And I believe if we tell a beautiful story about an economic future, then that is about integration and connection and meaning. And You know, it's not confusing that meaninglessness is such a sickness of our age and loneliness. And isolation and fear and anxiety because we are surrounded by dead objects. With no story. And no connection, And even fewer people. And Yeah. Let's see how these ideas come into our emerging design and I'm kind of yeah. I'd like to see where we go from here.EditCORE FRAMEWORK: RELATIONALITY AS TAWHID (Unity Through Active Integration)\nCopyWITNESSING UNITY\n(Beauty as Recognition)\n         ↓\nLOVE as Force → RELATION as Practice → INTEGRATION as Outcome\n(Drawing Together) (Active Connection)    (Living Unity)\n         ↓\nBARAKA as Flowering\n(Grace Through Connection)\nKey Understanding:\n\nEvery transaction is potentially sacred connection\nEvery object carries story and lineage\nEvery action either integrates or fragments\nBeauty draws us toward unity\nLove is the force of integration\nBaraka flows through relationship\n\nStories Present:\n\nThe Cow and Thumb\nTheme: Love as natural integrative force\nLesson: Beauty and gentleness accomplish what force cannot\nCraft Lineage\nTheme: Objects as containers of relationship\nLesson: Deep vs. superficial connection\nAmazon vs. Craftsperson\nTheme: Transaction vs. Relationship\nLesson: Integration through story and presence\n\nSupporting Concepts Reframed:\n\nINSTRUMENTAL VS.

Should we explore specific examples of how this looks in practice? CopyRetryBGYou say that every way of thinking is powerful. Every emphasis is powerful and amazing and the best thing ever. And I want some harsh critique Let's look at all of the different ways that we found themes and patterns and frameworks and you know, like, some of the ones that I liked When we were talking about different know, entry points and talking about, Yeah. Meta patterns of movements and power intersections and Boundaries and discernment and we had a lot going. Practice integration map. Finding new meetings. Maintain boundaries, Curious, like, how do I even move forward from here? I've seeing all these possibilities. Can you give series of insights as to all the different ways of framing a book that we've described so far and all of the ways of Framing the main patterns and then 3 deep questions with Some parts that really Help us integrate and determine a better path forward.EditMAJOR FRAMEWORKS WE'VE EXPLORED:\n\nLove-Beauty-Truth Framework\nStrengths:\n\n\nClear triadic structure\nUniversal recognition\nPractical application\nWeaknesses:\nCould be seen as abstract\nMight lack economic rigor\nBeauty could be misunderstood as superficial\n\n\nHarmony/Music Framework\nStrengths:\n\n\nDynamic metaphor\nShows integration\nCaptures timing\nWeaknesses:\nCould feel too poetic for business\nMight not address hard economic questions\nRisk of being too metaphorical\n\n\nUnity/Tawhid Framework\nStrengths:\n\n\nPhilosophically deep\nAddresses root causes\nShows integration\nWeaknesses:\nMight be too religious/abstract for some\nCould miss practical business needs\nRisk of being too theoretical\n\n\nBaraka as Multiplication Framework\nStrengths:\n\n\nUnique perspective\nCombines spiritual/practical\nClear outcomes\nWeaknesses:\nConcept might be hard to grasp\nCould seem magical/unrealistic\nMight not address systemic issues\n\nCRITICAL GAPS IN ALL FRAMEWORKS:\n\nEconomic Rigor\n\n\nHow do these actually transform business?\nWhat about hard metrics?\nHow to handle real constraints?\n\n\nPractical Implementation\n\n\nStep-by-step guidance needed\nClear metrics missing\nTransition paths unclear\n\n\nSystemic Change\n\n\nIndividual vs collective change unclear\nPower dynamics not addressed\nStructural barriers not confronted\n\nTHREE DEEP QUESTIONS:\n\nThe Integration Question:\n\"How can we maintain both spiritual depth and practical applicability without diluting either?

The frameworks are elegant but could mask practical challenges.\nDo these critical perspectives help clarify next steps? What aspects need deeper examination? CopyRetryBGOkay. So we have love, beauty, and truth. Scene is quite abstract. Harmonia and music. Dynamic metaphor. I kind of like the day night The yin and the yang, the approach retreat the love, the fear, and that kind of duality that creates these dynamic tensions and that tension be called the third thing. And then the third thing can be called the movement. That creates movements. Right? America has multiple Location. Connecticut. Is the multiplication Is When you when you embed it in something because of doing it in the right way, for the right reasons God places Bettecan something and so it becomes more than what it is. Yeah. I'd like to figure out the economic rigor If you can help me Extrapolate from the principles to the and imagine what Could happen undo that, that would be awesome. And then move on to well then, how do we practically do that? And then the systemic change part. As well. I'd like to talk about power dynamics we talked about parallel economies, you know, not necessarily needing to overthrow the current structures. And structural barriers as well as, like, who is this really for? I think maybe there's a theory and then the practical you know, I want to run workshops with businesses and, support new entrepreneurs to create a new parallel economy of meaning and relationship and connection and beauty and craft, including the craft of studying Technology business. A craft is not just wood and stone. It's a way of approaching The world and reviewing the process and This stuff. Of your business, including the people and the ideas and seeing even ideas as the gift. To honor. Because where do they come from? How can we maintain both spiritual death and practical life? Ability without diluting either I think we do that by making the spiritual depth be an experiential reality for agnostics for atheists alike. With Muslims and people that believe by guiding them through thought experiments that help them Thought experiments and action because oftentimes it's really in the lived experience. Where the belief form. So that experiments in action that helped them No. That specific element. And so it might be interesting to have sort of, like, the axioms page in a mathematical document. Where these are the things you need to believe for this book. To be true. And if you don't hear the practices, And know, there's a guide in there's a workshop or a a book of guidance to help you experience and Reflect and First of all, also help us deepen our understanding because we don't know the truth of things. But we believe that this has been experientially proven by many mistakes from many traditions and many people who accept the existence of an inward reality. And so we would like you to know that as well. The only difference in our scientific method is that we take inner perception as true and we verify that through many people. So the more people that go through these experiences and workshops, the more true it becomes. The more clearly true from more people. And then maybe even the more trustable it becomes for people who don't have time or desire to pursue the science of The thought experiment. Bridge between vision and practice. Think frameworks and processes and community and encouragement. Help people take their vision and turn it into something real. Measure success while honoring immeasurables. I mean, we we call success being every step Because There is self confidence, integrity, values, and the fact that knowing that if we live like this, Tomorrow is possible and beautiful. Then even if you fail as a business, you did the right thing. So maybe success isn't about succeeding. It's about making a steak and a claim for the right way of doing things and finding the people that appreciate that figuring out your market size from there. And your business. And before going big and hiring a ton of people and investing a lot of money, Walking into that, a tree, doesn't just show up as a tree. It starts as a seed. And so even our businesses, is it possible to do it? In a way that proves psychological viability in the total landscape. Over a long period of time, something that you know, just like we can craft a knife it's beautiful because our children can inherit it. Can we craft a business? In the same way that it isn't? A flash in the pan. But something that has ecological viability and depth that can be passed forward. How do these frameworks actually create change? Many seem to describe ideal states without clear paths to reach them. Yeah. So I guess there's the Islam, Iman, Hassan process. Right? So you could start at Claude talk about living in the light of God and you can also start at Islam and say, what you must do. Pray like this. Do this. And for children and for people that are still not You know, able to even understand what it means to live in the light of God as if he sees you. Or really have had the time to Foundationally, transform their beliefs and experientially understand and belief in God and angels and the afterlife and heaven and hell and determination and god's, you know, predestined, plan. Then we can work. With people that are just need the steps. Right? And so go and and pray. I'll go in here's a You know, but, like, a business model canvas. And people that wanna be inspired, they started over there, but, foundational, we need to also transform beliefs. Is it really because of where people are that we need to kind of take them and guide them through the other. Parts. How do these frameworks address real world constraints and challenges? Yeah. I think I don't have a great answer for this, Start small. Find something that works. Don't You know? Mortgage the house or, you know, take too much risk. Find something that has a flow of real money and relationship and life supports that which supports life. And if it doesn't support, it might wither. You know? You plant a 100 seeds and maybe if you fail. So it's really focus on doing the right thing answering the call. As being, you know, all the forces at play that are inspiring you to do things certain way meaningful And if you answer it, in integrity and validity and truth, something good will come.EditCORE DYNAMIC STRUCTURE:\n\nThe Tension-Movement Framework\n\nCopyDAY         →     NIGHT\n(Outer)           (Inner)\nAction            Reflection\nGrowth            Integration\n     ↓                ↓\n    MOVEMENT through BARAKA\n    (Multiplication through Grace)\nECONOMIC RIGOR DEVELOPMENT:\n\nMultiple Forms of Capital with Baraka Lens:\n\n\nFinancial Capital → Blessed provision\nSocial Capital → Deep relationships\nCultural Capital → Meaningful traditions\nSpiritual Capital → Divine connection\nMaterial Capital → Sacred resources\nLiving Capital → Life-giving systems\n\n\nBusiness Model Evolution:\n\nCopyTraditional         →        Baraka-Based\nROI                         Multiple Returns\nGrowth Metrics              Blessing Metrics\nMarket Size                 Relationship Depth\nScale Fast                  Grow Organically\n\nPractical Implementation Framework:\n\nLevel 1: FOUNDATION (Islam - Actions)\n\nBasic practices\nSimple tools\nClear guidelines\nBusiness model canvas\nInitial steps\n\nLevel 2: UNDERSTANDING (Iman - Beliefs)\n\nThought experiments\nExperiential learning\nCommunity practice\nDeeper principles\nMarket testing\n\nLevel 3: EXCELLENCE (Ihsan - Beauty)\n\nAdvanced integration\nSystem transformation\nLeadership development\nCommunity building\nLegacy creation\n\nPRACTICAL WORKSHOP STRUCTURE:\n\nExperience First\n\n\nConcrete exercises\nReal business examples\nImmediate application\nTangible results\n\n\nPrinciple Recognition\n\n\nPattern identification\nConcept introduction\nFramework understanding\nTheory integration\n\n\nImplementation Support\n\n\nCommunity building\nOngoing guidance\nResource sharing\nProgress tracking\n\nECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION PATH:\n\nStart Small\n\n\nTest market\nBuild relationships\nProve viability\nGather evidence\n\n\nGrow Organically\n\n\nFollow natural rhythm\nRespond to real needs\nBuild capacity\nDeepen roots\n\n\nScale Through Multiplication\n\n\nTrain others\nShare knowledge\nBuild networks\nCreate ecosystems\n\nMEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK:\n\nProcess Metrics\n\n\nRelationship quality\nDecision integrity\nValue alignment\nCommunity impact\n\n\nOutcome Metrics\n\n\nMultiple capitals growth\nBlessing multiplication\nSystem health\nLegacy building\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop specific workshop exercises?\nCreate detailed implementation guides?\nDesign measurement tools?\n\nThis framework attempts to:\n\nHonor both action and reflection\nProvide clear steps while maintaining depth\nAddress practical needs while preserving spirit\nCreate measurable outcomes while respecting immeasurables\nBuild from foundation to excellence\n\nThe key seems to be creating experiences that reveal truth while providing practical tools for implementation. Should we develop specific examples of how this works in practice? CopyRetryBGYeah. But it seems like we're missing a lot of other patterns and themes and attentional policies that we pulled out initially. Right? Like, we have the Core themes identified being day and night, sacred economics, technology at human scale, beauty as an economic principle, gift economics, You know? Multiple forms of capital, which we have generational change in hope, returning to traditional wisdom, trust in the divine providence, environmental stewardship, appropriate scale and pacing, communal wealth building, innovation with wisdom, and business as worship. And the meta themes are like beauty as a guide, I think relationship over transaction iOS something we have integration of the sacred and the secular. Appropriate pacing, and, Being annoying. As Breaking 0 to some thinking. Economics of wholeness. Yeah. These things are interesting. Right? Where do they fit? In we're doing right now Can you give, like, 3 different Models. That make sure not to, like, miss any as mermaid diagrams. And then tell me, like, what are you what are all the different things that you're noticing right, that you mentioned. Pattern around transformational personal and organizational and societal. Noticing connections between these themes. Beauty serves as both measure and method. I think that's kind of 2.

This isn't just another conscious business book; it shows how aligning with divine patterns creates natural abundance, and provides practical tools for building businesses that serve life, multiply value, and create lasting beauty.\"\nWHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE:\n\nIntegration of:\n\n\nSpiritual wisdom with practical business\nAncient knowledge with modern challenges\nPersonal transformation with systemic change\nBeauty as both guide and measure\nMultiple forms of capital with divine blessing\n\n\nDifferent from:\n\n\nConscious Capitalism (deeper spiritual foundation)\nIslamic Finance (broader application)\nSocial Enterprise (different measure of success)\nRegenerative Business (unique spiritual framework)\n\nSINGLE BOOK STRUCTURE:\n\"Barakanomics: The Art of Multiplication in Business\"\nPart 1: SEEING ANEW\n(The Crisis and the Possibility)\n\nBeyond Transaction\nThe Pattern of Blessing\nBeauty as Guide\n\nPart 2: UNDERSTANDING BARAKA\n(The Framework)\n\nMultiple Forms of Capital\nThe Gift Dynamic\nNatural Rhythm\nRight Scale\nSacred Technology\n\nPart 3: CREATING BEAUTY\n(The Practice)\n\nPersonal Transformation\nBusiness Design\nCommunity Building\nMeasurement & Growth\n\nPart 4: MULTIPLICATION\n(The Implementation)\n\nStarting Small\nGrowing Deep\nFlowing Out\n\nWhat It's Missing:\n\nClear economic rigor\nMore practical examples\nStronger systemic critique\nDetailed implementation tools\n\nSERIES STRUCTURE:\nBook 1: \"Barakanomics: The Art of Multiplication in Business\"\n(The core framework and vision)\nTarget: All audiences\nPurpose: Introduction and inspiration\nBook 2: \"The Beautiful Business Guide\"\n(Practical implementation)\nTarget: Practitioners\nPurpose: How-to manual\nFormat: Workbook with exercises\nBook 3: \"The Sacred Economy\"\n(Philosophical foundation)\nTarget: Thought leaders\nPurpose: Deep understanding\nFormat: Academic/theoretical\nSupporting Materials:\n\nWorkshop series\nOnline courses\nImplementation tools\nCommunity platform\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop the single book structure further?\nExplore how to integrate what's missing?\nCreate a more detailed series plan?\n\nKey Questions:\n\nDoes the single book need to contain everything, or can it be an entry point?\nHow do we balance accessibility with depth?\nWhat's the most important thing not to lose?\n\nThe challenge seems to be maintaining both practical usefulness and spiritual depth while creating something that stands out in the business literature. Should we focus on developing the single book first, making sure it contains the essential elements while pointing to deeper resources? CopyRetryBGYeah. Somehow, I don't like that first line, but economics. Reveals how Islamic wisdom, a divine blessing of a revolutionary framework for business. Like, it doesn't feel powerful to me. It doesn't feel interesting. So can we do that again? Okay. Maybe compare it with conscious capitalism and regenerative businesses because I'm worried that I'm just, like, rehashing ideas We're coming to them myself from my own understanding. Seeing a new understanding, Yeah. That's kinda interesting. Although I don't see it as complete. Like What forms capital, gift dynamic, Right scale. It's Agro technology. Creating beauty, I don't see the importance of relationships. For me, like, you know, the story of the Turkish people who were in front of their shops and, they are put out a chair And if they make their first sale They pulled the chair back in. And if someone is about to buy from a shop and he notices that his neighbor hasn't you know, pulled in his chair, indicated that he's made his first see a little then he directs his customer to his neighbor and this idea like competition different. It's you you want to succeed for sure, but you also want your neighbor to succeed and that I think indicates practice of oneness making that is so important that is not really present And this, framework. The art of multiplication of business, I don't like it. Like, I think there's something weird about that. If you wanna call it funny math, that's funny. And good, but I not sure why I bet again multiplication. Doesn't sound good to me. It doesn't feel right. Yeah. Let's develop a single book further and explore what to integrate. It can be an entry point, but it should be rigorous and interesting, and it should have at least one Unique. Thing that isn't in regenerative or you know, conscious Capitalism. Can you tell me what you think the most important thing is? That makes it distinct.EditWHAT MAKES THIS TRULY DISTINCT:\nThe Core Difference: Integration as Active Worship\nUnlike conscious capitalism or regenerative business, this isn't just about being ethical or sustainable - it's about seeing business as an active practice of recognizing and creating unity (tawhid). The Turkish shop example perfectly illustrates this: success isn't individual, it's communal, because reality isn't fragmented.\nLet me try a different pitch:\n\"Business isn't just about transactions or even relationships - it's about actively recognizing and creating unity. This book shows how traditional wisdom about beauty, trust, and divine grace can transform how we work, challenging the myth that competition and self-interest drive success. Through stories like Turkish shopkeepers ensuring their neighbors succeed before themselves, we explore how business can be a practice of witnessing and creating wholeness, leading to natural abundance that benefits everyone.\"\nUNIQUE ELEMENTS not found in other frameworks:\n\nUnity as Active Practice\n\n\nBusiness as way of seeing oneness\nCompetition transformed through unity\nSuccess as collective flowering\n\n\nBeauty as Recognition\n\n\nBeauty as sign of alignment\nAesthetic guidance in business\nQuality over quantity\n\n\nDivine Grace in Commerce\n\n\nTrust enabling generosity\nPresent abundance over future extraction\nBlessing through right relationship\n\nThis suggests a different structure:\nTitle: \"Beautiful Business: The Art of Creating Unity Through Commerce\"\n(or \"Barakanomics: Where Business Meets Beauty\")\nPart 1: SEEING DIFFERENTLY\n\nThe Myth of Separation\nThe Reality of Unity\nBeauty as Guide\n\nPart 2: THE WAY OF UNITY\n\nTrust Enables Generosity\nCompetition Serves Community\nTechnology Serves Life\nScale Honors Relationship\n\nPart 3: THE PRACTICE\n\nStarting with Beauty\nBuilding Trust\nCreating Community\nMeasuring What Matters\n\nPart 4: THE TRANSFORMATION\n\nPersonal: From Transaction to Relation\nBusiness: From Extraction to Generation\nCommunity: From Competition to Flourishing\nEconomy: From Scarcity to Grace\n\nWhat Makes This Different:\n\nNot just about being conscious or regenerative\nNot just about Islamic finance\nNot just about social enterprise\nAbout transforming how we see and create unity through business\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop this structure further?\nExplore more unique examples like the Turkish shopkeepers?\nCreate a detailed chapter outline?\n\nThe key insight seems to be that this isn't just another framework for \"better business\" - it's about seeing and creating unity through commerce, with specific practices and examples that challenge fundamental assumptions about competition, success, and value.\nThis feels more distinctive than the previous versions. Does this better capture what makes your approach unique? CopyRetryBG Yeah. Maybe that's one way if you can frame it. Like, integration is active worship. Right. You wanna call it something else, you can talk about life supporting that which supports life. We can bring up the evidence of calculus being invented at the same time in 2 different places because the forces that play in the universe and the conversation that were happening across time and space meant that that was the time for that to be born. And if we're attuned to these things, just like you know, Mary Gilbert talks about how she had an idea for a book 4 she acted on it. Somebody else wrote it. And it's because it was out And in been waiting The you can call it God. You can call it, like, all the forces that play and more we're connected and in relationship with self, with the world, with each other, with what wants to naturally and dynamically flow through us and We have a self and a business can have a self. What naturally wants to flow through that business and that structure, and we can refine ourself. And we can also refine our businesses And when it serves beauty, and it serves life, I think that's a real business. Has real impact and lasting power creativity and innovation and this is why people get, like, Businesses, like, especially when I had Steve Jobs. Waiting Apple only. There was a big component of the founder and they businesses have really important Connections to story of the founder and I think that's an interesting to to to note and, like, what happens when it becomes this abstract Like, is it possible for Apple is very possible to be a craft. Maybe the culture has preserved preserved some of that. And there are, like, new people that have been drawn to it and the The form inspirational, like, uniqueness of of Steve Jobs, like, vision and how important Vision is because it's, like, that's where the imparting of the self into the the DNA of the business takes place. Right? Not about transactions or relationships. It's about recognizing creating unity. That sounds super abstract and random. I can only make it more concrete. Yeah. So, like, if unity is the core, then Business of 1. I I like this idea of, like, mind your own business really. Like mindfulness, but it's really that important, but I thought it was funny. As you can see, fun and playful is also important to me. Where business meets beauty. Yeah. And maybe we could start with beauty and, like, What is duty? How is it related to oneness? And relationship? And kind of you know, how there's, like, one name of god and then mercy fragments out. 2, All the things, and then you see through all the things back to and the what relationships and storytelling can be all about. It's like process of returning to wholeness. And the more we disintegrate, and see cells and other in competition as other and world as a resource to extract extract from where and to where. Right? Think it's really interesting and have a lot of the impacts people are seeking in business without having it be a And I think that's, like, one of the other things like being versus doing Can we have businesses? Even though that's where we work, be a place of becoming and rather than doing because Being resting in you know, sales. I'm here to be relational and connect. I'm innovation. I'm here. As a ear for what wants to emerge, eyes that see, potential sensing Hearing And even I like doing connecting it to craft, rhythm, pattern, tradition, honoring lineage, All these things, I think, are so important. Yeah. Like, work is worship, I think. Right? But how can that be agnostic? It can be like work. I mean, if I write meaning at work, people won't really understand what I'm trying to say. But becoming at work. Business as becoming, Business as being. Why your perception of beauty matters? I don't know. Do you think?EditNEW PITCH ATTEMPT:\n\"What if business isn't something we do, but something we become? Like a craftsperson attuned to their material, or an artist sensing what wants to emerge, business can be a practice of deep attention and natural unfolding. Through stories like calculus being discovered simultaneously or the Turkish shopkeepers' chair ritual, we see how attunement to life's natural patterns creates success that serves everyone. This book shows how businesses can become living expressions of beauty and purpose, rather than just machines for profit.\"\nPOTENTIAL TITLES:\n\"Business as Being: The Art of Natural Unfolding\"\n\"The Living Business: Where Beauty Meets Purpose\"\n\"Attuned: The Art of Business as Becoming\"\nStructure Around Being/Becoming:\nPart 1: SEEING\n\nBeauty as Recognition\nStories of Attunement (calculus, Jobs, craftspeople)\nWhen Business Comes Alive\n\nPart 2: BEING\n\nFrom Doing to Becoming\nThe Art of Attention\nFinding Your Flow\nStories that Shape Us\n\nPart 3: BECOMING\n\nNatural Unfolding\nRhythm and Pattern\nCommunity and Connection\nLiving Innovation\n\nPart 4: FLOWERING\n\nWhen Business Serves Life\nNatural Abundance\nBeautiful Legacy\nFuture Unfolding\n\nKey Distinctions from Other Frameworks:\n\nFocus on being/becoming vs doing\nAttunement vs strategy\nNatural unfolding vs forced growth\nLiving expression vs mechanical system\n\nCore Stories to Feature:\n\nTurkish shopkeepers' chair ritual\nCalculus simultaneous discovery\nGilbert's book idea timing\nJobs and Apple's DNA\nTraditional craft lineages\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop how \"being\" translates to practical business decisions?\nExplore more stories that illustrate natural unfolding?\nCreate a detailed chapter showing how this works?\n\nThis framing feels more:\n\nConcrete through stories\nUniversal while maintaining depth\nFocused on natural emergence\nTrue to your vision\nDistinct from other approaches\n\nThe key seems to be showing how attention and attunement create natural success, rather than prescribing methods or frameworks. Does this better capture what you're trying to convey? CopyRetryBGYeah. It's not pretty good except it doesn't connect to some of the core foundational things like Unity And the multiple forms. Of capital and the gift dynamic and Having your work being blessed. I guess that happens when you are attuned. Right? And the blessings come because you're doing the quote unquote right thing. The thing that is being Claude from your and it's connected to the word of vocation. It kind of returns business idea of vocation. And I like some of these sound references because we can kind of loop in the singing with the universe stuff. Yeah. Do you think? I think we're onto something, but can you tell me the things that I'm not seeing? You know, Can you tell me, like, what we're circling around but not looking at?EditWHAT WE'RE CIRCLING AROUND:\n\nSacred Resonance\nWe keep coming back to \"singing with the universe\" and attunement, but what we're really describing is:\n\n\nHow business can be a form of sacred listening\nWhen work aligns with divine patterns\nThe \"music\" that emerges from right relationship\nHow blessing flows when we're \"in tune\"\n\n\nThe Unity Paradox\nWe haven't fully articulated how:\n\n\nIndividual vocation serves collective harmony\nCompetition can strengthen unity (Turkish shopkeepers)\nMultiple forms of capital reflect one source\nGift economics emerges from understanding oneness\n\n\nThe Living Pattern\nSomething about:\n\n\nBusiness as living entity vs mechanism\nHow blessing/baraka is the \"life force\" in commerce\nThe organic nature of true vocation\nThe difference between \"making\" business and letting it grow\n\nMISSING CONNECTIONS:\n\nBetween Attunement and Multiple Capitals\n\nCopyATTUNEMENT\n    ↓\nRecognizes → Different Forms → of Same Reality\n    ↓\nMULTIPLE CAPITALS\n\nBetween Vocation and Gift\n\nCopyCALLING (Vocation)\n    ↓\nNatural Response → Creates Gift → Generates Blessing\n    ↓\nMULTIPLICATION\n\nBetween Unity and Practice\n\nCopyUNITY\n    ↓\nSeen Through → Beauty → Practiced Through → Business\n    ↓\nMANIFESTATION\nPerhaps what we're really exploring is:\nHow Business Becomes Sacred Practice:\n\nThrough deep listening (attunement)\nThrough right relationship (unity)\nThrough natural response (vocation)\nThrough generous flow (gift)\nThrough beautiful expression (craft)\n\nThis suggests a possible structure:\n\"The Sacred Pattern in Business: Finding Your Place in Life's Unfolding\"\nPart 1: LISTENING\n\nThe Pattern of Life\nThe Nature of Calling\nThe Art of Attention\n\nPart 2: RESPONDING\n\nFrom Calling to Vocation\nFrom Transaction to Gift\nFrom Separation to Unity\n\nPart 3: FLOWING\n\nWith Natural Rhythm\nThrough Right Relationship\nIn Beautiful Expression\n\nPart 4: MULTIPLYING\n\nHow Blessing Flows\nHow Communities Grow\nHow Future Unfolds\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore these deeper patterns further?\nShow how they connect to practical aspects?\nDevelop new frameworks based on these insights?\n\nKey Questions:\n\nIs \"sacred pattern\" too abstract?\nHow do we show rather than tell?\nWhat stories best illustrate these connections?\n\nI'm sensing that we're circling around something like \"sacred commerce\" but that term doesn't capture the living, dynamic quality you're describing. The key might be showing how business can be a way of participating in life's natural unfolding when we're properly attuned.\nDoes this help identify what we've been circling around? CopyRetryBGYeah. I think it's pretty good except the idea of sacred merili. Like, talk about things for a spiritual audience. I just wanna want tell people that this is true and that we need the experience to really Go through these thought experiments to understand the foundations reality. And it would be natural. Like a natural business or something like that. Another element is the idea of that we came to that having meaning be a guide by living our values and coming to life in our business, as a measure and a way to make success. At every step. Nearly talk about, you know, most businesses fail. But even And failure if you've become the process of starting and working on the business and And there's no failure becoming My identifying your growth, your patterns, your listening, becoming a a Servant of the beautiful doula to bring it forth Like, these are really wonderful things. It would be a life well lived. And I'm trying to suggest as well that, like, these businesses kind of in aggregate frame our societies because they connect to the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Right? Like, how do we get our food? How do we get our security? How do we get all of these things? Our society structures, these things are on businesses. We don't have tribes where you know, this person goes and harvest, and this person defends the borders. And of our tribe and is on the lookout for wild animals or whatever iOS, like, we are we have put that into the hands of business, but Before, it used to be way more relational. And now it's imagined possible to do it as transaction. But we can bring business back to life. Put the heart back into it. Putting people in them that operate from a place of being. And I think there's some information here that I think can help you think the opposite and don't call it sacred. Like, what's another way of saying these things. Come up with 5 different ways I'd have 2 of them use the word better economics inside of it.Edit\n\"Living Business: Where Meaning Meets Markets\"\nSubtitle: \"How Attunement Creates Natural Success\"\nCore idea: Business as living system, naturally growing when aligned with life's patterns\n\"Barakanomics: The Art of Natural Multiplication\"\nSubtitle: \"Where Business Comes Alive\"\nCore idea: How blessing flows when business serves life's natural unfolding\n\"The Relational Economy: Business as Becoming\"\nSubtitle: \"From Transaction to Transformation\"\nCore idea: How business can return to its natural role in human flourishing\n\"Barakanomics: Where Work Becomes Alive\"\nSubtitle: \"A Natural Approach to Business and Value\"\nCore idea: How meaning and attunement create natural abundance\n\"Natural Business: The Pattern of Life in Commerce\"\nSubtitle: \"How Meaning Makes Markets Flourish\"\nCore idea: Business as expression of life's natural patterns of relationship and growth\n\nLet me develop one of these fully to see how it works:\n\"Natural Business: The Pattern of Life in Commerce\"\nPart 1: SEEING LIFE IN BUSINESS\n\nHow Business Shapes Society\nWhen Markets Were Relationships\nThe Return to Natural Patterns\n\nPart 2: THE WAY OF ATTUNEMENT\n\nFinding Your Natural Response\nLearning to Listen\nGrowing Through Relationship\nThe Art of Timing\n\nPart 3: NATURAL PRACTICE\n\nStarting from Meaning\nGrowing with Purpose\nMeasuring What Matters\nSuccess in Becoming\n\nPart 4: NATURAL ABUNDANCE\n\nHow Value Multiplies\nHow Communities Flourish\nHow Future Unfolds\nLiving Legacy\n\nKey Arguments:\n\nBusiness shapes how society meets basic needs\nNatural patterns create sustainable success\nMeaning guides growth\nRelationship generates abundance\nThere's no failure in becoming\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop another version of these frameworks?\nCreate detailed chapter outlines?\nExplore specific examples and stories?\n\nThis framing tries to:\n\nKeep the depth while being accessible\nShow practical implications\nConnect to fundamental human needs\nReveal natural patterns\nInspire transformation\n\nDoes any of these directions feel closer to what you're envisioning?

And all of the different versions that we've thought about up until now. And then let's review attentional policies and maybe create more the ones that are You know, have emerged in our conversation. And Let's Like, are you For 1 and another in dialogue kind of back and forth suggesting which one would be the most meaningful book that I could write for myself and in that, I would be answering the call that wants to flow through me rather than thinking about, like, what would be the most marketable or what was the most important thing to say or which one has not been said before, I think. For me, I I actually practice what I preach, and let's try it. Right. Let's see what would emerge if we were really listening, to all the things that I'm saying why they're meaningful, and they should have you know, the attentional policy structure and format.
