  "executive_summary": "May 2025 - PREP WORK for Solar Iraq training (2 months before implementation). Bilal interviews Iraqi solar expert Hussam Hassan, reviews curriculum, refines training design for Mosul implementation. Shows systematic preparation: expert interviews → curriculum refinement → implementation (July). This is NOT ad-hoc - it's thoughtful educational design.",

    "mission_statement": "Our goal in Mosul isn't just to teach 'green energy' theory; we want people to get jobs or launch businesses in solar. So we need a course that takes someone who already has some technical foundation—say an engineer or technician—and gives them the know-how and the business sense to earn a living in the sector.",
    "practical_focus": "Right now I'm looking for trainers like you. Our goal in Mosul isn't just to teach 'green energy' theory; we want people to get jobs or launch businesses in solar.",
