      "content": "You are a questionnaire professional, I'm working on an onboarding journaling prompt to give to social enterprises who are assessing their skills. I would like a small subset of comprehensive and though provoking questions that will give me as a program manager deeper insights and context into the motivations and values as well as the needs so I can provide the entrepreneurs better support personally and professionally. I am providing a list of questions, please critique them and then modify them based on your critique as a professional questionnaire writer in the style of the School of Life\n\nOrigin Story: Imagine a parallel universe where your social enterprise follows an entirely different mission. What would your alternate origin story be, and how might your unique character strengths still lead you to become a social entrepreneur in Lebanon?\nValues: If you had to choose a core value that is least associated with your current venture, what would it be, and how might incorporating this value into your business lead to unexpected outcomes or opportunities in Lebanon?\nModes of Learning: Reflect on your self-assessment results and think of a skill essential to your venture's success that you could learn from an unexpected source in Lebanon (e.g., an elderly neighbor, a local street vendor, or a traditional craftsperson). How would this unique learning experience contribute to your personal and professional growth?\nObstacles and Challenges: Envision a future where the biggest challenges facing your social enterprise have been solved by someone else. Considering your self-assessment results, how would this affect your approach to your venture in Lebanon, and what new opportunities or growth areas might you pursue instead?\nCollaboration, Well-being, and Balance: Recall a situation when collaboration with others led to unexpected challenges or conflicts. What lessons did you learn from this experience, and how will you use these insights, along with your self-assessment results, to improve collaboration and well-being in your venture?\nImpact: If you had to measure the social impact of your venture using unconventional or qualitative indicators (e.g., stories of personal transformation, community pride), how might you assess its success in Lebanon, and what new insights might you gain by considering your unique character strengths?\nStakeholder Engagement: Picture a future where your venture achieves its goals in Lebanon in a completely different way than you initially imagined. What alternative approaches or partnerships might have led to this outcome, and how might your self-assessment results change the way you engage with various stakeholders (e.g., customers, partners, investors)?\nWell-being and Personal Growth: Reflect on your well-being and personal growth as a social entrepreneur. Based on your self-assessment results, can you identify any surprising strengths or areas for improvement that could be leveraged to enhance your overall well-being, resilience, and effectiveness within your social enterprise?",

      "content": "As a professional questionnaire writer, I appreciate the depth and thoughtfulness of your questions. However, I have some suggestions to make them more concise, focused, and engaging. Here's a modified version of your questions in the style of the School of Life:\n\n1. Parallel Universe Origin Story: In a parallel universe, your social enterprise follows a different mission. Share your alternate origin story and explain how your unique character strengths would still lead you to be a social entrepreneur in Lebanon.\n\n2. Unexpected Core Value: Identify a core value less associated with your current venture. How might integrating this value into your business create unforeseen outcomes or opportunities in Lebanon?\n\n3. Unconventional Learning Sources: Describe a crucial skill for your venture's success that you could learn from an unexpected source in Lebanon. How would this unique learning experience foster your personal and professional growth?\n\n4. Overcoming Obstacles: Imagine a future where the major challenges facing your social enterprise are resolved by someone else. Based on your self-assessment, how would this alter your approach in Lebanon and reveal new opportunities or growth areas?\n\n5. Collaboration Lessons: Share an instance when collaboration led to unanticipated challenges or conflicts. How will you apply these insights and your self-assessment findings to enhance collaboration and well-being in your venture?\n\n6. Unconventional Impact Measurement: Using nontraditional or qualitative indicators, assess your venture's social impact in Lebanon. How would considering your unique character strengths provide new insights into its success?\n\n7. Alternative Stakeholder Engagement: Visualize a future where your venture achieves its goals in Lebanon differently than initially planned. What alternative approaches or partnerships might have led to this outcome, and how could your self-assessment findings reshape stakeholder engagement?\n\n8. Well-being and Growth Insights: Reflect on your well-being and personal growth as a social entrepreneur. Based on your self-assessment, identify any unexpected strengths or areas for improvement that could be harnessed to enhance your overall well-being, resilience, and effectiveness within your social enterprise.",
