      "content": "Certainly! To achieve this, we can use the BeautifulSoup library to parse the webpage and extract all the links. Then, we'll utilize the `pdfkit` library to save each link as a PDF. You'll need to install the `beautifulsoup4` and `pdfkit` packages to run this script.\n\nHere's an example Python script that performs the task you described:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport pdfkit\n\ndef save_link_as_pdf(url):\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n    links = soup.find_all('a')\n\n    for link in links:\n        href = link.get('href')\n        if href.startswith('http'):\n            try:\n                pdfkit.from_url(href, 'output.pdf')\n                print(f'Successfully saved {href} as PDF.')\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f'Error saving {href} as PDF: {str(e)}')\n\n# Example usage\nwebpage_url = 'https://example.com'\nsave_link_as_pdf(webpage_url)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'https://example.com'` with the URL of the webpage you want to process. This script will go through every link on the webpage, check if it starts with `'http'` (to filter out non-HTTP links), and attempt to save it as a PDF using `pdfkit`. The resulting PDF files will be saved as `'output.pdf'` in the current working directory.\n\nPlease note that the `pdfkit` library requires additional dependencies such as `wkhtmltopdf`, so you may need to install those dependencies separately. Refer to the `pdfkit` documentation for installation instructions specific to your operating system.\n\nRemember to handle any exceptions that may occur during the process, as certain websites may have restrictions or may not support conversion to PDF.",
