What must we compromise / cut to do this well?\nTo create a unified framework that combines the strengths of both the INSPIRE learning techniques and the SCRIBER elements, we need to identify the core principles and objectives of each approach and find ways to integrate them seamlessly. Here's a proposed mapping between the two frameworks:\nInquiry-Based Learning (INSPIRE) ⟷ Seek & Inquire (SCRIBER)\nBoth emphasize the importance of asking questions, exploring new ideas, and investigating topics deeply.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning (INSPIRE) ⟷ Reflect (SCRIBER)\nBoth focus on the value of introspection, storytelling, and drawing insights from personal experiences.\nSelf-Directed Learning (INSPIRE) ⟷ Broaden/Contract & Recurse (SCRIBER)\nBoth encourage learners to take ownership of their learning process, set goals, and continuously refine their approach.\nProblem-Based Learning (INSPIRE) ⟷ Critique & Explain (SCRIBER)\nBoth involve analyzing complex issues, providing constructive feedback, and explaining concepts clearly.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning (INSPIRE) ⟷ Seek & Broaden/Contract (SCRIBER)\nBoth promote learning through social interactions, diverse perspectives, and collective knowledge-building.\nResilience & Grit (INSPIRE) ⟷ Recurse (SCRIBER)\nBoth emphasize the importance of perseverance, adaptability, and learning from setbacks.\nExperiential Learning (INSPIRE) ⟷ Seek, Inquire & Recurse (SCRIBER)\nBoth prioritize hands-on learning, real-world applications, and iterative experimentation.\nSelf-Efficacy & Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy (INSPIRE) ⟷ Reflect, Critique & Explain (SCRIBER)\nBoth aim to build learners' confidence, self-awareness, and ability to effectively communicate their ideas.\nCritique and Higher-Level Approach:\nWhile the proposed mapping demonstrates the compatibility between the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks, having two separate frameworks may still lead to redundancy and complexity in the AI-assisted mentoring system. To streamline the approach and create a more cohesive user experience, we should consider merging the two frameworks into a single, unified model.\nThe unified framework could be structured around the core phases of the learning process, with elements from both INSPIRE and SCRIBER integrated into each phase. For example:\nDiscover (Seek, Inquire, Experiential Learning, Interactive & Collaborative Learning)\nEncourage learners to explore new ideas, ask questions, and learn through hands-on experiences and social interactions.\nAnalyze (Critique, Problem-Based Learning, Reflective Learning)\nGuide learners in critically examining complex issues, providing constructive feedback, and reflecting on their experiences.\nSynthesize (Explain, Narrative Learning, Self-Directed Learning)\nHelp learners articulate their understanding, draw connections between ideas, and take ownership of their learning process.\nIterate (Recurse, Resilience & Grit, Self-Efficacy)\nSupport learners in continuously refining their approach, building resilience, and developing confidence in their abilities.\nBy consolidating the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks into these four core phases, we can maintain the essential principles and objectives of both approaches while simplifying the overall structure. This unified framework would be more intuitive for users to navigate and easier for the AI-assisted mentoring system to implement.\nTo achieve this integration, we may need to compromise on some of the more granular elements of each framework and focus on the overarching themes and objectives. For example, rather than explicitly addressing each INSPIRE learning technique or SCRIBER element individually, the AI-assisted mentoring system could incorporate their key principles into the broader phases of the learning process.\nUltimately, the goal is to create a streamlined, user-friendly framework that leverages the strengths of both INSPIRE and SCRIBER while minimizing complexity and redundancy. By carefully merging these two approaches into a cohesive model, we can provide learners with a powerful, adaptive, and engaging mentoring experience.\nBG\nwhat is the acronym and the list of agents and the agent system prompt for the new framework? Think step by step and critique your work iteratively as you go\nStep 1: Identifying the core phases of the new unified framework\nThe new framework consists of four core phases: Discover, Analyze, Synthesize, and Iterate (DASI).\nStep 2: Defining the acronym\nThe acronym for the new unified framework is DASI, which stands for:\nDiscover\nAnalyze\nSynthesize\nIterate\nCritique: The acronym DASI is short, memorable, and clearly represents the four core phases of the learning process. It effectively communicates the iterative nature of the framework.\nStep 3: Identifying the agents for each phase\nDiscover Agent\nResponsible for guiding learners in exploring new ideas, asking questions, and engaging in experiential and collaborative learning.\nAnalyze Agent\nAssists learners in critically examining complex issues, providing constructive feedback, and facilitating reflective learning.\nSynthesize Agent\nHelps learners articulate their understanding, draw connections between ideas, and take ownership of their learning process.\nIterate Agent\nSupports learners in continuously refining their approach, building resilience, and developing confidence in their abilities.\nCritique: The four agents align well with the core phases of the DASI framework and cover the essential aspects of the learning process. However, it might be beneficial to consider adding a fifth agent focused on goal-setting and progress tracking to ensure learners stay motivated and on track.\nStep 4: Refining the agents\nBased on the critique, we will add a fifth agent to the framework:\nNavigate Agent\nAssists learners in setting goals, tracking progress, and adjusting their learning path as needed.\nCritique: The addition of the Navigate Agent enhances the framework by providing learners with a clear sense of direction and helping them stay focused on their objectives. The five agents now comprehensively support the learning process from start to finish.\nStep 5: Developing the agent system prompts\nDiscover Agent\nSystem prompt: \"As the Discover Agent, your role is to inspire curiosity and encourage exploration. Guide learners in asking thought-provoking questions, seeking out new ideas, and engaging in hands-on learning experiences. Help them collaborate with others and learn from diverse perspectives.\"\nAnalyze Agent\nSystem prompt: \"You are the Analyze Agent, responsible for fostering critical thinking and reflection. Assist learners in breaking down complex issues, providing constructive feedback, and examining their experiences from multiple angles. Encourage them to think deeply and question their assumptions.\"\nSynthesize Agent\nSystem prompt: \"As the Synthesize Agent, your task is to help learners integrate their knowledge and articulate their understanding. Guide them in drawing connections between ideas, creating narratives, and communicating their insights effectively. Support their development as self-directed learners.\"\nIterate Agent\nSystem prompt: \"You are the Iterate Agent, focused on fostering resilience and continuous improvement. Encourage learners to view setbacks as opportunities for growth, adapt their strategies, and persist in the face of challenges. Help them build confidence in their abilities and embrace the iterative nature of learning.\"\nNavigate Agent\nSystem prompt: \"As the Navigate Agent, your role is to help learners set clear goals, track their progress, and adjust their course as needed. Assist them in breaking down their objectives into manageable steps, celebrating their achievements, and identifying areas for improvement. Provide guidance and support to keep them motivated and on track.\"\nCritique: The agent system prompts clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each agent within the DASI framework. They emphasize the key principles and objectives of each phase while providing guidance on how to support learners effectively. The prompts strike a balance between providing structure and allowing for flexibility in the agents' interactions with learners.\nStep 6: Finalizing the DASI framework\nBased on the iterative development and critiques, the final DASI framework consists of five agents (Discover, Analyze, Synthesize, Iterate, and Navigate) with well-defined system prompts. This unified framework combines the strengths of the INSPIRE and SCRIBER approaches while streamlining the learning process and providing comprehensive support for learners.\nI.N.S.P.I.R.E. Aligned Pedagogical Frameworks For Transformational Learning Prompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLM\nPASTED\nBG\nis it comprehensive, DASI, what is missing from it that can be found here:\nAfter reviewing the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks and comparing them to the DASI framework, I believe that DASI covers most of the key elements and principles from both approaches. However, there are a few aspects that could be further emphasized or incorporated to make DASI even more comprehensive:\nNarrative and Reflective Learning\nThe INSPIRE framework highlights the importance of storytelling and personal reflection in the learning process.\nWhile the Analyze and Synthesize phases of DASI touch on reflective learning, the framework could benefit from a stronger emphasis on narrative learning and the role of storytelling in making sense of experiences and communicating insights.\nResilience and Grit\nThe INSPIRE framework explicitly addresses the development of persistence and resilience as a key aspect of learning.\nAlthough the Iterate phase of DASI encompasses the idea of continuous improvement and learning from setbacks, it could be enhanced by more directly addressing the cultivation of resilience and grit.\nInteractive and Collaborative Learning\nThe INSPIRE framework emphasizes the value of learning through interaction and collaboration with others.\nWhile the Discover phase of DASI mentions collaborative learning, the framework could further highlight the importance of social interaction, diverse perspectives, and collective knowledge-building throughout the learning process.\nSelf-Efficacy and Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nThe INSPIRE framework includes self-efficacy and entrepreneurial self-efficacy as key elements in building confidence and achieving success in entrepreneurial tasks.\nDASI could benefit from explicitly addressing the development of self-efficacy and domain-specific self-efficacy (e.g., entrepreneurial self-efficacy) as part of the learning journey.\nTo incorporate these elements, the DASI framework could be expanded or refined in the following ways:\nEmphasize narrative learning and storytelling in the Synthesize phase, encouraging learners to articulate their experiences and insights through compelling narratives.\nAdd a separate phase or sub-phase focused on building resilience and grit, providing strategies and support for persisting through challenges and setbacks.\nIncorporate interactive and collaborative learning opportunities throughout the DASI phases, promoting social interaction, diverse perspectives, and collective knowledge-building.\nInclude self-efficacy development as an explicit goal of the DASI framework, with targeted activities and support for building confidence and domain-specific self-efficacy.\nBy addressing these aspects, the DASI framework can become an even more comprehensive and effective approach to AI-assisted learning, incorporating the key strengths of both the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks while maintaining its streamlined structure and focus on the core phases of the learning process.\nBG\nCan you incorporate those elements and write a DASI 3-pager internal document describing the history, current status, and future questions for DASI. Think step by step and explain your reasoning for the structure of the document and conclude with how it will be implemented in the auto-mentorship and self-learning LLM prompt improvement tool\nHere's a step-by-step approach to creating the DASI 3-pager internal document:\nStep 1: Determine the purpose and audience of the document\nPurpose: To provide an overview of the DASI framework, its history, current status, and future directions, as well as its application in the auto-mentorship and self-learning LLM prompt improvement tool.\nAudience: Internal stakeholders, including team members, managers, and potential collaborators.\nStep 2: Outline the structure of the document\nIntroduction\nBrief overview of the DASI framework and its significance\nHistory and Development\nOrigins of the DASI framework\nKey influences and inspirations (INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks)\nIterative development process and refinements\nCurrent Status\nCore phases and elements of the DASI framework\nIntegration of key principles from INSPIRE and SCRIBER\nStrengths and unique features of DASI\nFuture Directions\nPotential enhancements and expansions to the DASI framework\nResearch questions and areas for further exploration\nLong-term vision for DASI's impact on AI-assisted learning\nApplication in Auto-Mentorship and Self-Learning Tool\nHow DASI will be implemented in the tool\nExpected benefits and outcomes for users\nIntegration with other components and features of the tool\nConclusion\nRecap of key points and significance of the DASI framework\nCall to action for collaboration and support\nStep 3: Draft the document content\nDASI Framework: Empowering AI-Assisted Learning\nIntroduction The DASI (Discover, Analyze, Synthesize, Iterate) framework represents a comprehensive and streamlined approach to AI-assisted learning, designed to empower learners and optimize their growth through a structured, iterative process. By integrating key principles from the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks, DASI offers a powerful tool for self-directed learning and auto-mentorship.\nHistory and Development The DASI framework emerged from a need to create a unified, effective approach to AI-assisted learning that leverages the strengths of existing pedagogical frameworks. Drawing inspiration from the INSPIRE framework's emphasis on various learning techniques and the SCRIBER framework's structured questioning methodology, DASI was developed through an iterative process of analysis, synthesis, and refinement.\nCurrent Status DASI consists of four core phases: Discover, Analyze, Synthesize, and Iterate, each encompassing key elements from the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks. The Discover phase encourages exploration, inquiry, and collaborative learning; the Analyze phase promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, and reflection; the Synthesize phase focuses on articulation, narrative learning, and self-directed learning; and the Iterate phase emphasizes continuous improvement, resilience, and self-efficacy development. DASI's streamlined structure and comprehensive approach set it apart as a powerful tool for AI-assisted learning.\nFuture Directions As the DASI framework continues to evolve, several potential enhancements and expansions are being considered. These include a stronger emphasis on narrative learning and storytelling, explicit strategies for building resilience and grit, increased opportunities for interactive and collaborative learning, and targeted activities for developing self-efficacy. Ongoing research will explore the effectiveness of these enhancements and identify new areas for further development. The long-term vision for DASI is to revolutionize AI-assisted learning and empower learners worldwide.\nApplication in Auto-Mentorship and Self-Learning Tool The DASI framework will serve as the foundation for the auto-mentorship and self-learning LLM prompt improvement tool. By guiding users through the four core phases of the learning process, the tool will help them identify areas for growth, engage in meaningful reflection, and iteratively refine their knowledge and skills. DASI's integration with other components, such as the goal-setting and progress-tracking features, will create a seamless and personalized learning experience. The tool is expected to enhance users' self-directed learning capabilities, boost their confidence, and accelerate their overall growth.\nConclusion The DASI framework represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted learning, offering a comprehensive, flexible, and effective approach to self-directed growth. By integrating the best elements of the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks, DASI provides a powerful foundation for the auto-mentorship and self-learning LLM prompt improvement tool. As we continue to refine and expand the framework, we invite collaboration and support from all stakeholders to help realize the full potential of DASI in transforming the landscape of AI-assisted learning.\nStep 4: Review and revise the document\nEnsure clarity, coherence, and logical flow of ideas\nCheck for grammatical and typographical errors\nSeek feedback from colleagues and incorporate suggestions as appropriate\nStep 5: Finalize and distribute the document\nFormat the document for easy readability and visual appeal\nShare the document with the intended audience through appropriate channels (e.g., email, shared drives, or project management platforms)\nEncourage feedback and discussion to foster collaboration and ongoing improvement of the DASI framework and its application in the auto-mentorship and self-learning tool.\nBy following this step-by-step approach, you can create a comprehensive and informative 3-pager internal document that effectively communicates the history, current status, and future directions of the DASI framework, as well as its implementation in the auto-mentorship and self-learning LLM prompt improvement tool. The document's structure is designed to provide a clear overview of the framework's development, key features, and potential impact, while also inviting collaboration and support from internal stakeholders.\nBG\nok make a table comparing and contrasting all three frameworks in markdown and then critique the dasi framework harshly and find out where it's missing something interesting and deep\nFramework\tCore Elements\tFocus\tLearning Process\tKey Influences\nINSPIRE\t- Inquiry-Based Learning<br>- Narrative & Reflective Learning<br>- Self-Directed Learning<br>- Problem-Based Learning<br>- Interactive & Collaborative Learning<br>- Resilience & Grit<br>- Experiential Learning<br>- Self-Efficacy & Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\t- Emphasizes various learning techniques and approaches<br>- Focuses on learner engagement and personal growth<br>- Promotes self-direction and resilience\t- Learners actively engage in various learning techniques<br>- Learning is driven by inquiry, reflection, and problem-solving<br>- Collaborative and experiential learning are encouraged\t- Pedagogical theories and frameworks<br>- Theories of self-efficacy and grit\nSCRIBER\t- Seek<br>- Critique<br>- Reflect<br>- Inquire<br>- Broaden/Contract<br>- Explain<br>- Recurse\t- Provides a structured questioning methodology<br>- Focuses on iterative refinement and exploration<br>- Promotes critical thinking and reflection\t- Learners follow a structured process of questioning and reflection<br>- Learning is driven by seeking knowledge, critiquing ideas, and explaining understanding<br>- Iterative process of broadening and contracting knowledge\t- Socratic questioning<br>- Reflective practice<br>- Iterative learning models\nDASI\t- Discover<br>- Analyze<br>- Synthesize<br>- Iterate\t- Integrates key principles from INSPIRE and SCRIBER<br>- Provides a streamlined and comprehensive approach to AI-assisted learning<br>- Focuses on self-directed learning and auto-mentorship\t- Learners engage in a structured, iterative process of discovery, analysis, synthesis, and iteration<br>- Learning is driven by exploration, critical thinking, articulation, and continuous improvement<br>- Incorporates elements of narrative learning, resilience, collaboration, and self-efficacy development\t- INSPIRE framework<br>- SCRIBER framework<br>- AI-assisted learning principles\nHarsh Critique of the DASI Framework:\nWhile the DASI framework attempts to integrate key principles from the INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks, it falls short in several areas:\nLack of depth: DASI simplifies the learning process into four broad phases, which may not fully capture the nuances and complexities of various learning techniques and approaches. By attempting to streamline the framework, it risks oversimplifying the learning process and losing sight of important elements that contribute to deep, meaningful learning.\nInsufficient emphasis on collaboration and social learning: Although DASI mentions collaborative learning in the Discover phase, it does not place a strong enough emphasis on the role of social interaction and collaborative knowledge construction throughout the learning process. Learning is often a social endeavor, and the framework should more explicitly address the importance of learning communities, peer feedback, and collective sense-making.\nLimited focus on affective and motivational factors: DASI does not adequately address the affective and motivational aspects of learning, such as the role of emotions, intrinsic motivation, and self-regulation. These factors play a crucial role in learner engagement and persistence, and their absence from the framework may limit its effectiveness in promoting long-term learning and growth.\nInadequate consideration of individual differences: The DASI framework does not sufficiently account for individual differences in learning preferences, prior knowledge, and cultural backgrounds. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective for all learners, and the framework should provide more guidance on how to adapt and personalize the learning process based on individual needs and contexts.\nLack of explicit guidance on metacognition: While DASI touches on reflection and self-directed learning, it does not provide explicit guidance on developing metacognitive skills, such as planning, monitoring, and evaluating one's own learning. Metacognition is a critical component of effective learning, and the framework should place a stronger emphasis on fostering these skills.\nLimited integration with domain-specific knowledge: DASI is presented as a general framework for AI-assisted learning, but it does not provide clear guidance on how to integrate domain-specific knowledge and skills into the learning process. The framework should offer more explicit strategies for bridging the gap between general learning principles and the unique demands of different subject areas and disciplines.\nTo address these limitations, the DASI framework could be enhanced by:\nIncorporating more specific strategies and techniques for promoting deep, meaningful learning within each phase of the framework.\nPlacing a stronger emphasis on collaborative learning and social interaction throughout the learning process.\nExplicitly addressing affective and motivational factors that influence learning, such as emotions, intrinsic motivation, and self-regulation.\nProviding guidance on how to adapt and personalize the learning process based on individual differences and contexts.\nOffering explicit strategies for developing metacognitive skills and fostering self-regulated learning.\nIntegrating domain-specific knowledge and skills into the framework, and providing guidance on how to apply the framework to different subject areas and disciplines.\nBy addressing these critiques and incorporating the suggested enhancements, the DASI framework can become a more comprehensive, effective, and adaptable approach to AI-assisted learning that promotes deep, meaningful growth for all learners.\nBG\nthey're all missing broaden and contract, vector dimensionality and volume, vector directionality for goal orientation, they're all missing the fundamental main points of leveraging the implications that knowledge is stored in embedding vectors which was the attempt we had in the SCRIBER framework to find out how to leverage that to learn what we dont yet know we need to learn by \"navigating\" close by with our own language and asking the AI to \"look around\" in the vector space and explain what it sees in language familiar to us. Review all the frameworks for the connection to leveraging embeddings structure and operation and identify a new meta framework that focuses on this to support learning\nYou raise an excellent point about the importance of leveraging the implications of knowledge being stored in embedding vectors, which is a key aspect that the existing frameworks (INSPIRE, SCRIBER, and DASI) do not adequately address. The concept of navigating nearby vector spaces and asking the AI to \"look around\" and explain what it sees in familiar language is a powerful approach to learning what we don't yet know we need to learn.\nUpon reviewing the frameworks, it becomes clear that they do not fully capitalize on the potential of embedding vectors and their properties, such as:\nVector dimensionality and volume: Understanding the size and complexity of the knowledge space represented by the embeddings.\nVector directionality for goal orientation: Using the direction of vectors to guide learners towards their learning goals and objectives.\nBroaden and contract: Exploring the knowledge space by expanding or narrowing the focus based on the learner's needs and interests.\nTo address these gaps and leverage the power of embeddings, we propose a new meta-framework called VECTOR (Vector Embedding-based Collaborative Teaching, Orientation, and Reflection):\nVector Space Navigation:\nEncourage learners to explore the knowledge space by navigating nearby vector regions using their own language and prompts.\nGuide the AI to \"look around\" the vector space and explain the concepts, ideas, and connections it discovers in language familiar to the learner.\nUse vector dimensionality and volume to help learners understand the size and complexity of the knowledge space they are exploring.\nEmbedding-based Goal Orientation:\nUtilize vector directionality to guide learners towards their learning goals and objectives.\nHelp learners identify the vector regions that align with their goals and provide guidance on how to navigate towards those areas.\nContinuously assess the learner's progress by comparing their current position in the vector space to their desired goals.\nCollaborative Exploration:\nFoster collaboration between the learner and the AI in exploring the knowledge space and discovering new insights.\nEncourage learners to share their findings and insights with others, creating a shared knowledge base and facilitating collaborative learning.\nLeverage the AI's ability to identify connections and patterns across different learners' explorations to enrich the overall learning experience.\nTeachable Moments:\nIdentify opportune moments for teaching and learning based on the learner's current position and trajectory in the vector space.\nProvide contextualized explanations, examples, and analogies that help learners bridge the gap between their current understanding and the new concepts they encounter.\nAdapt the teaching approach based on the learner's feedback and progress, ensuring a personalized and effective learning experience.\nReflective Practice:\nEncourage learners to reflect on their learning journey and the insights they have gained from exploring the vector space.\nPrompt learners to articulate their understanding, identify gaps in their knowledge, and set new learning goals based on their reflections.\nUse the AI's feedback and insights to help learners refine their reflections and develop a deeper understanding of their learning process.\nBroaden and Contract:\nSupport learners in expanding or narrowing their focus based on their interests and learning objectives.\nGuide learners in exploring related vector regions to broaden their understanding of a topic or domain.\nHelp learners contract their focus to dive deeper into specific concepts or ideas that are most relevant to their goals.\nBy focusing on these key aspects of embedding vectors and their properties, the VECTOR meta-framework aims to empower learners to navigate the knowledge space effectively, discover new insights, and learn what they don't yet know they need to learn. This approach leverages the power of AI-assisted learning while maintaining a strong emphasis on learner agency, collaboration, and reflective practice.\nThe VECTOR meta-framework can be implemented in the auto-mentorship and self-learning LLM prompt improvement tool by incorporating features and functionalities that support vector space navigation, embedding-based goal orientation, collaborative exploration, teachable moments, reflective practice, and the ability to broaden and contract the learning focus. By integrating these elements into the tool, learners will be able to harness the full potential of embedding vectors and AI-assisted learning to achieve their learning goals and continuously expand their knowledge and skills.\nBG\nno broaden and contract is about moving near your location when you don't know what that location is and asking for 10 diverse orthogonal ideas for solutions and then using ai to critique. The other important element missing is the personality driven questioning where it takes on a persona and asks you questions to help you first refine your idea, identify goals, make plans, and find frameworks so you can \"drive there\"\nAll this is missing and it's become a generic learning \"oh, iterate, it's good to learn you good\". it's not very helpful, go back and review what i said and do it again. reflect on how you made this error and make sure it doesn't happen again\nI apologize for misinterpreting the concept of broaden and contract and not fully addressing the importance of personality-driven questioning in the learning process. Thank you for pointing out these gaps and giving me the opportunity to reflect on my error and improve my response.\nUpon revisiting your explanation, I realize that the key aspects I missed are:\nBroaden and contract: Moving near your current location in the knowledge space when you don't know what that location is, asking for 10 diverse orthogonal ideas for solutions, and using AI to critique those ideas.\nPersonality-driven questioning: Having the AI take on a persona to ask questions that help you refine your idea, identify goals, make plans, and find frameworks to \"drive\" towards your objectives.\nTo address these essential elements and leverage the power of embedding vectors, I propose a revised meta-framework called NAVIGATE (kNowledge Acquisition through Vector-based Inquiry, Goal-oriented Exploration, and Adaptive Tutoring):\nLocalized Exploration:\nHelp learners identify their current location in the knowledge space, even if they are unsure of where they are.\nEncourage learners to explore nearby vector regions by asking the AI to generate 10 diverse and orthogonal ideas for solutions or concepts related to their current location.\nUse the AI to critique and analyze the generated ideas, providing insights and guidance to help learners navigate the knowledge space effectively.\nPersona-based Inquiry:\nHave the AI take on different personas (e.g., a curious child, a domain expert, a skeptic) to ask questions that challenge learners to refine their ideas, clarify their thinking, and explore new perspectives.\nUse persona-based questioning to help learners identify their goals, make plans, and find appropriate frameworks to guide their learning journey.\nAdapt the AI's persona and questioning style based on the learner's needs, preferences, and progress, providing a tailored and engaging learning experience.\nGoal-oriented Navigation:\nUse the learner's identified goals and plans to guide their navigation through the knowledge space.\nHelp learners identify the vector regions that align with their objectives and provide guidance on how to \"drive\" towards those areas.\nContinuously assess the learner's progress and adjust the navigation strategy based on their performance and feedback.\nAdaptive Tutoring:\nUse the AI's understanding of the learner's current knowledge state and learning style to provide personalized explanations, examples, and analogies.\nContinuously adapt the tutoring approach based on the learner's feedback, progress, and interactions with the AI.\nIdentify knowledge gaps and misconceptions, and provide targeted interventions to help learners overcome these challenges.\nReflection and Metacognition:\nEncourage learners to reflect on their learning journey, the insights they have gained, and the strategies they have used to navigate the knowledge space.\nPrompt learners to articulate their understanding, identify areas for improvement, and set new learning goals based on their reflections.\nUse the AI's feedback and insights to help learners develop metacognitive skills and become more self-aware, self-directed learners.\nIterative Refinement:\nEncourage learners to iteratively refine their ideas, plans, and strategies based on the feedback and insights gained through exploration, inquiry, and reflection.\nUse the AI to help learners identify patterns, connections, and trends in their learning journey, and provide guidance on how to leverage these insights for continuous improvement.\nFoster a growth mindset and encourage learners to embrace challenges, learn from setbacks, and persistently work towards their goals.\nBy focusing on these key aspects of localized exploration, persona-based inquiry, goal-oriented navigation, adaptive tutoring, reflection and metacognition, and iterative refinement, the NAVIGATE meta-framework aims to harness the power of embedding vectors and AI-assisted learning to help learners explore the knowledge space, refine their ideas, identify goals, make plans, and find frameworks to drive towards their objectives.\nThe NAVIGATE meta-framework can be implemented in the auto-mentorship and self-learning LLM prompt improvement tool by incorporating features and functionalities that support:\nLocalized exploration and generation of diverse, orthogonal ideas\nPersona-based questioning and inquiry\nGoal-setting and planning tools\nAdaptive tutoring and personalized feedback\nReflection prompts and metacognitive skill development\nIterative refinement and progress tracking\nBy integrating these elements into the tool and leveraging the underlying structure of embedding vectors, learners will be empowered to navigate the knowledge space effectively, refine their ideas, identify goals, make plans, and find frameworks to drive their learning journey. This approach aims to provide a more targeted, personalized, and engaging learning experience that helps learners acquire the knowledge and skills they need to achieve their objectives.\nI apologize for my earlier oversight and thank you for the opportunity to reflect on my mistake and provide a more accurate and comprehensive response.\nI.N.S.P.I.R.E. Aligned Pedagogical Frameworks For Transformational Learning Prompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLM\nPASTED\nBG\nok, let's review against the original scriber. what's missing, what's new. Which pedagological frameworks are not addressed?\nUpon reviewing the original SCRIBER framework and comparing it to the NAVIGATE meta-framework, I've identified the following key points:\nWhat's missing from NAVIGATE:\nExplicit emphasis on constructive critique and seeking feedback from antagonist personas (Critique element in SCRIBER).\nSpecific focus on generating worksheets, templates, and guidelines for self-reflection (Reflect element in SCRIBER).\nEmphasis on the importance of breaking down steps and keeping prompts small for AI transparency (Explain element in SCRIBER).\nWhat's new in NAVIGATE:\nLocalized exploration: Identifying current location in the knowledge space and exploring nearby regions by generating diverse and orthogonal ideas.\nPersona-based inquiry: AI taking on different personas to ask questions, challenge learners, and help refine ideas and goals.\nGoal-oriented navigation: Using identified goals and plans to guide navigation through the knowledge space.\nAdaptive tutoring: Personalized explanations, examples, and analogies based on the learner's knowledge state and learning style.\nIterative refinement: Encouraging learners to refine their ideas, plans, and strategies based on feedback and insights gained through the learning process.\nPedagogical frameworks not explicitly addressed in NAVIGATE:\nProblem-Based Learning: While NAVIGATE emphasizes goal-oriented navigation and adaptive tutoring, it does not explicitly mention learning through addressing real-world problems.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning: NAVIGATE focuses more on individual learning and interaction with the AI, rather than emphasizing collaboration with other learners.\nExperiential Learning: Although NAVIGATE promotes reflection and metacognition, it does not explicitly mention hands-on activities or the stages of experiential learning (experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation).\nTo further enhance the NAVIGATE meta-framework, I suggest incorporating the following elements from SCRIBER and the missing pedagogical frameworks:\nConstructive Critique: Encourage learners to seek feedback from diverse perspectives, including antagonist personas, to refine their ideas and approaches.\nStructured Reflection: Provide learners with worksheets, templates, and guidelines to facilitate self-reflection and critical thinking.\nAI Transparency: Emphasize the importance of breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps and keeping prompts concise to ensure AI transparency and reduce the risk of errors.\nProblem-Based Learning: Incorporate real-world problems and scenarios into the learning process to help learners develop problem-solving skills and apply their knowledge in practical contexts.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning: Foster collaboration among learners by creating opportunities for shared knowledge-building, peer feedback, and collective problem-solving.\nExperiential Learning: Integrate hands-on activities and encourage learners to engage in the four stages of experiential learning (experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation) to deepen their understanding and apply their knowledge in practice.\nBy addressing these missing elements and incorporating insights from the original SCRIBER framework and additional pedagogical frameworks, the NAVIGATE meta-framework can provide a more comprehensive and effective approach to AI-assisted learning. This enhanced version of NAVIGATE will better support learners in exploring the knowledge space, refining their ideas, identifying goals, and developing the skills and strategies needed to succeed in their learning journey.\nBG\nLet's update navigate with your suggestions and make a table like we have in the original scriber, be sure to align it with INSPIRE and SCRIBER and the pedagological underpinnings as well as giving ways of being, practical tactic example prompts and the name of the principle with a cool acronym\nHere's the updated NAVIGATE framework with the suggested enhancements, presented in a table format similar to the original SCRIBER framework. The table includes the alignment with INSPIRE and SCRIBER, pedagogical underpinnings, ways of being, practical tactic example prompts, and the name of each principle.\nNAVIGATE Principle\tWay of Being\tPractical Tactic Example Prompts\tINSPIRE Alignment\tSCRIBER Alignment\tPedagogical Underpinning\nNurture Curiosity\tInquisitive and open-minded\t\"What are 10 diverse ideas related to [topic]?\"\tInquiry-Based Learning\tSeek\tConstructivism\nAntagonist Feedback\tReceptive to critique\t\"Critique my idea from the perspective of [antagonist persona].\"\tProblem-Based Learning\tCritique\tSocial Constructivism\nVisualize Goals\tAmbitious and focused\t\"What are my learning goals, and how can I navigate towards them?\"\tSelf-Directed Learning\tInquire\tGoal Theory\nInvestigate Connections\tCurious and analytical\t\"How does [idea 1] relate to [idea 2]?

Provide their perspective.\"\tInteractive & Collaborative Learning\tBroaden/Contract\tSocial Learning Theory\nThe updated NAVIGATE framework, represented by the acronym NAVIGATE (Nurture curiosity, Antagonist feedback, Visualize goals, Investigate connections, Generate reflections, Adaptive tutoring, Transparent steps, Explore perspectives), incorporates elements from both INSPIRE and SCRIBER while introducing new principles to create a comprehensive approach to AI-assisted learning.\nEach principle is accompanied by a way of being that learners should embody, along with practical tactic example prompts to guide their interactions with the AI. The alignment with INSPIRE and SCRIBER frameworks is indicated, showcasing how NAVIGATE builds upon and integrates these approaches.\nFurthermore, the pedagogical underpinnings for each principle are identified, drawing from various learning theories and frameworks such as Constructivism, Social Constructivism, Goal Theory, Connectivism, Reflective Practice, Scaffolding, Cognitive Load Theory, and Social Learning Theory. These pedagogical foundations ensure that the NAVIGATE framework is grounded in established educational principles and practices.\nBy presenting the NAVIGATE framework in this table format, learners and educators can easily understand the key principles, their alignment with existing frameworks, and the pedagogical theories that support them. The practical tactic example prompts provide concrete guidance on how to apply these principles in their interactions with AI, while the ways of being serve as aspirational mindsets to cultivate throughout the learning journey.\nBG\ncritique this by neil postman and pretend he took a red marker to it. review and summarize wha the scratched out and what he wrote. And then redo the table. This time add a column describing how it takes advantage of embeddings and merge the INSPIRE and pedagogy column and remove the way of being column\nNeil Postman's Critique:\nNeil Postman would likely view the NAVIGATE framework with a critical eye, particularly in terms of its reliance on AI and its potential impact on human learning and interaction. He might argue that the framework places too much emphasis on AI-assisted learning, potentially undermining the development of critical thinking skills and human autonomy.\nPostman might cross out the \"Way of Being\" column, suggesting that it promotes a superficial engagement with learning and encourages learners to rely too heavily on AI guidance. He may also question the alignment with various pedagogical theories, arguing that the framework cherry-picks elements from different approaches without fully considering their implications or potential contradictions.\nIn the \"Practical Tactic Example Prompts\" column, Postman might highlight the prompts that seem to outsource human thinking to AI, such as \"Critique my idea from the perspective of [antagonist persona]\" or \"Explain [concept] using an analogy tailored to my knowledge level.\" He may write comments suggesting that these prompts could lead to a diminished capacity for independent thought and problem-solving.\nPostman might also express concerns about the \"Adaptive Tutoring\" principle, arguing that it could lead to an over-reliance on AI for personalized instruction, potentially eroding the role of human teachers and mentors in the learning process.\nDespite these critiques, Postman might appreciate the emphasis on curiosity, reflective practice, and exploring diverse perspectives. He could write notes acknowledging the importance of these elements in fostering critical thinking and intellectual growth.\nRevised NAVIGATE Framework Table:\nNAVIGATE Principle\tPractical Tactic Example Prompts\tINSPIRE Alignment & Pedagogical Underpinning\tEmbedding Advantage\nNurture Curiosity\t\"What are 10 diverse ideas related to [topic]?\"\tInquiry-Based Learning (Constructivism)\tExplore diverse ideas in the embedding space\nAntagonist Feedback\t\"Critique my idea from the perspective of [antagonist persona].\"\tProblem-Based Learning (Social Constructivism)\tUtilize embeddings to generate critiques from different perspectives\nVisualize Goals\t\"What are my learning goals, and how can I navigate towards them?\"\tSelf-Directed Learning (Goal Theory)\tUse embeddings to identify relevant knowledge areas for goal achievement\nInvestigate Connections\t\"How does [idea 1] relate to [idea 2]?

A new column, \"Embedding Advantage,\" has been added to describe how each principle leverages the power of embeddings to enhance learning and discovery.\nBy incorporating Postman's critique, the revised NAVIGATE framework table addresses concerns about over-reliance on AI and potential erosion of human thinking skills. The \"Embedding Advantage\" column highlights how embeddings can be used to support and augment human learning, rather than replace it. This revised framework seeks to strike a balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and fostering the development of critical thinking, reflection, and independent problem-solving skills.\nBG\"\"\"",

If you want to use LLMs effectively, you must comprehend the concept of traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nOver hundreds of hours of GPT use since last December, we’ve built this intuition. Now we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting. \n\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse) and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions.\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think for Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique and explain\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you can be wrong. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it… \nSimple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \nLook at yourself from the third person: \nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks you questions so you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about.\n\n\nINSPIRE Aligned with SCRIBER and Assessments:\n\nINSPIRE Framework \nDescription\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nSCRIBER Framework \nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data analysis.\nSeek: Encouraging exploratory and deep questions.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nReflect: Promoting reflection through guided questioning and critical thinking.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nInquire: Learners guide their learning path with AI assistance.\nProblem Based Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nCritique: Seeking feedback and perspectives to tackle problems.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, communication in group settings.\nBroaden/Contract: Seeking diverse perspectives and refining ideas collaboratively.\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\nRecurse: Building resilience through iterative questioning and problem-solving.\nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nExplain: Deepening experiential learning through AI challenges.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\nAll SCRIBER Elements: Enhancing self-efficacy through various learning aspects.\n\n\n\n\n\nINSPIRE Pedagogical View\nFramework Element\nDescription\nImpact Measurement\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nDepth and complexity of inquiry by learners.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data analysis.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nConnection between personal experiences and learning objectives.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nProgress towards self-set learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nProblem-Based Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-solving skills and application of knowledge.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative skills and interaction quality.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, communication in group settings.\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nPerseverance in learning challenges.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nApplication of theoretical knowledge in practice.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nConfidence in managing entrepreneurial challenges.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\n",

Is it personalization, identifying knowledge gaps, fostering cross-disciplinary insights, or providing immersive learning experiences?\nHow important is alignment with pedagogical concepts to you? Do you prefer a framework that strongly aligns with established learning theories, or are you open to more experimental approaches?\nWhat level of complexity are you comfortable with in terms of embedding-based learning? Do you prefer a more straightforward approach or one that involves advanced techniques like scenario simulation and role-playing?\nHow do you plan to measure the success of the embedding-based learning framework? Will you focus on learner engagement, knowledge acquisition, skill development, or a combination of these factors?\nDo you have any specific constraints or requirements, such as the need for real-time adaptability, scalability, or integration with existing learning platforms?\nBased on your answers to these questions, I can help refine the frameworks and suggest the one that best aligns with your needs and priorities. By leveraging the power of embeddings in a way that resonates with your goals and constraints, we can create a highly effective and engaging learning experience that drives meaningful results.\nBG\ni believe that it's now possible to self mentor because embeddings are like dewey/loc and you can find things oyu wouldln't otherwise, you can use conversation style to help dialog which helps people think, and since socratic method works you can leran anything, also and do very creative learning things with the analogies\n2. not super important we can skip ones that don't align well, stick to the practical stuff that is exciting\ncomplex is awesome, i really liked my panel of critical experts idea\n4. combination - definitely want then to use our methodology more on their own as i see it as learning how to learn. This is why it is not a framework that's practical only. the skills developed practiing it sohuld be how to learn on your own\nnope no realtime no constraints.",
