It is in this context this research has been conducted with a group of education oriented social entrepreneurs working in Lebanon. During our qualitative and quantitative study our participants experienced a combination of challenges from a currency devaluation, political instability and a large explosion in the center of Beirut. \n\nWe believe that developing educational experiences which promote post traumatic growth in this context is critical to support the development of an anti-fragile society. Thus we offer this paper as a contribution exploring the factors which contribute to our participant’s continued efforts in their entrepreneurial initiatives. Being social entrepreneurs, they are the future of stability in society, creating employment and addressing fundamental needs connected to SDGs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Protective Properties of Group Laughter \nHumor, Character Strengths and Deliberate Rumination For Social Entrepreneurs in Lebanon in Crisis\nFactors Contributing to Post Traumatic Growth for Social Entrepreneurs in Crisis\nBackground: In 2020 the world was challenged by a global pandemic. In Lebanon, the addition of an economic collapse and a major explosion in the capital city brought acute stressors, triggering migration ideation. In this study, we identify factors that support social entrepreneur’s access to post traumatic growth (PTG) by analyzing resilience and character strengths within an entrepreneurship training program in Beirut. \nMethods:  Over the course of Dec 2020 and April 2021 we gathered 21 hours and a half interviews with Lebanese social entrepreneurs going through an entrepreneurship training program, all of whom were living in Lebanon and experienced the August 2020 Beirut port explosion. Alongside these interviews we gathered a set of qualitative data including pre-post assessments of Character Strengths (VIA), Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTG-I), Intrusive and Deliberate Rumination (EERI), Entrepreneurial Intent (EI), Resilience (BRCS) and the Impact of Event - Revised (IES-R). Correlations were identified with factors that support PTG and social entrepreneurial ideation. \nResults: Character Strengths are correlated with PTG and there are validated methods for reliably developing strengths of character. One highly leverable strength is humor, and one way humor can support growth is by preventing helplessness. \nConclusions: While each person’s life journey is unique, we have identified that social entrepreneurship ideation is promoted by prior traumatic experiences if followed by opportunities and support for growth. Traumatic experiences are inescapable in life, and the opportunity educators and trainers have is to understand how to shift the trauma response curve towards growth. Deliberate Rumination, thinking and reflecting about one’s life circumstances can happen spontaneously and importantly they can be nurtured by incorporating them into group facilitations for training programs and schools. \nImplications:  The results of this study increases an understanding of the complex decision making individuals face in a crisis, and offers insights into the factors which support posttraumatic growth and social entrepreneurship. We hope the results of this paper inspire facilitators to incorporate humor, positive structured conversation and to enliven their program with character development. \nKeywords: Post Traumatic Growth, Social Entrepreneurship, Trauma, Lebanon, Training and Education, Character Strengths\nIntroduction: \nTrauma conscious pedagogies (Mays 2021) are becoming a widespread topic amongst educators in a post-covid-19 world, and in this paper we explore some factors and methodologies that can support growth during times of collective crisis. In 2020 the Lebanese people experienced the coronavirus pandemic, economic crisis as well as an explosion at the Beirut Port which killed over 200 people and left over 300,000 homeless in its wake. Working as an educator with social entrepreneurs in Lebanon we observed a growing frustration with the idea of resilience, with participants seeing it as a passive way oppressors remain in power while the population deals with the consequences of their mistakes. Rather than bounce back, we  began to explore the factors which promote Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) looking beyond resilience and recovery. We ask how can educators going through times of crisis promote anti-fragility, the ability to use difficulties as opportunities for growth?\n\nPeople respond differently to traumatic events and people’s Character Strengths can provide a framework to understand those responses as well as which traits may support individuals through times of crisis. Character Strengths are 24 relatively stable positive qualities in humans identified through a cross cultural analysis of what makes life worth living. Certain character strengths like kindness, social intelligence and hope have been demonstrated to protect against the negative effects of stress and trauma (Harzer 2015). It was also demonstrated that an overall growth in the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory is correlated with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (Peterson et al. 2008). Importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their strengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018). Assessing the behaviors that promote PTG and life satisfaction, we find deliberate rumination as an important vector. (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve, C. L. 2011) \n\nThe purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the factors that promote Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) to support educators working in environments undergoing crisis. Social enterprise support efforts are often funded and established in areas of need and therefore often the participants of these programs are likely to experience difficulties. add our evidence reinforcing the idea that nurturing character strengths as a whole, and hope, judgment, teamwork and humor in particular may increase the likelihood of growth after traumatic events. Previous studies demonstrate that Deliberate Rumination is a contributing factor for PTG and we have been able to identify judgment and teamwork as correlated Character Strengths. Lastly we recommend programs operating in areas and times of crisis to explore interventions to nurture the buffering Character Strengths of hope and humor while cultivating a group dynamic that can promote judgment and teamwork. \n\n\nTHE REST IS NEEDING TO BE CLEANED UP:\nMethodology\nWe’ve used a qualitative analysis method for the exploration of our research, in an attempt to identify potentially unforeseen variables. The author of this paper has been able to utilize their position as the head of Research And Development at Bloom, an organization which operates social enterprise education programs. Prior to the Beirut Port Explosion in August 2020, the participants and applicants for the Bloom social entrepreneurship accelerator program had taken the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory (VIA-IS). At the conclusion of the four months long accelerator, and following the Beirut Explosion, all applicants to the program requested to complete a post-test VIA-IS inventory, those in the program and those not selected.\n\nAn analysis of the pre/post test data for the VIA-IS demonstrated a buffering effect experienced by individuals who were a part of the Bloom program, which led to in-program individuals maintaining their overall VIA average while individuals outside the program experienced a significant drop. To understand this phenomenon was the genesis of this research, and inspired the qualitative/quantitative research methodology described below.\n\nQualitative Analysis: \nThe qualitative analysis consisted of twenty one 1.5 hour long interviews, which were all conducted remotely and recorded digitally. The interviewees were split with 10 people coming from outside the training program and 11 people who had gone through the training program (marked as “In prog.”). The questions for the interview were segmented into the following themes:\nTopic\nKey Insight Explored\nIntroduction and Background\nWork habits and family entrepreneurial background\nEthnographic Questions\nWhat is their educational/ family's income level?\nEntrepreneurial Intent (EI)\nWhat is their level of commitment to entrepreneurship?\nImpact of Event Scale (IES-R)\nWhat was the level of impact of the Beirut Explosion?\nResilience (BRCS)\nWhat is their level of resilience?\nPost Traumatic Growth Index \n(PTGI)\nHow much did people grow after the Beirut Explosion?\nRumination Scales \nWhat is the ratio of deliberate and intrusive rumination?\nConcluding Statements\nWhat does entrepreneurship mean in places facing instability?\n\nThe interview consisted of open-ended questions as well as questions requesting a qualitative response. Both questions were answered live on the call, allowing the interviewee to offer deeper context into the numerical responses. The audio for the interviews were transcribed manually, and an inductive process was followed to derive codes. The interview corpus was then brought into a software supporting bi-directional links through which code clusters were identified.\n\nQuantitative Data: \nDuring the semi-structured interview process, alongside the open-ended questions, the interviewer also gathered quantitative answers for the following measures:\n\t1\tPost Traumatic Growth Index (PTGI Tedeschi & Calhoun 1996)\n\t2\tThe Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS Sinclair and Wallson 2004)\n\t3\tThe Impact of Event Scale: Revised (IES-R DS Weiss 2007)\n\t4\tThe Intrusive - Event Related Rumination Inventory (EERI Cann et al., 2011)\n\t5\tEntrepreneurial Intention (EI) scale derived from Luthje & Frank (2003); Duijn (2009) / Krueger et al. (2000)\n\t6\tThe VIA Inventory referenced above. Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2004)\n\nA subset of the codes derived from the interview corpus were identified as meaningful segmentation markers, and each interview was then tagged in the database for analysis with the observed value.\n\nSegmentation Tags:\nProperty\nFields\nDescription\nHas_Therepist\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the individual attend therapy?\nInjury_From_Blast\nTrue/False/Unsure\nWas the interviewee injured in the Beirut Port Explosion?\nEntrepreneurial_Family\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the interviewee come from an entrepreneurial family?\nPlacebuilding_Ideation \nTrue/False/Unsure\nIs the interviewee committed to using their working life to contribute to society?\nMigration_Ideation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nIs the interviewee considering migrating out of Lebanon?\nRevolutionary_Ideation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the interviewee politically active, engage in protests, view their work as activism?\nIncome_Simplified\nLower/Middle/Upper\nHow does the participant view their families income bracket?\nMeditation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the participant have an active meditation practice?\nResults\nOverview of Data and Background Knowledge\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially described by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory has since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This model now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses to neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an individual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of responses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues that the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018). \nBefore we get into the analysis of the data, please review the prior description of the data and data gathering phase. If you would like to explore the data yourself, you can find a public dataset available to review here: http://bit.ly/cs-data-21 \n\nThe Character Strengths data was gathered as part of the application process for a social entrepreneurship program before the August 4th, 2020 explosion. After the explosion, to understand deeper changes in entrepreneurial ideation we conducted a second VIA-IS as well as a new questionnaire using the new measures described above. To start the exploration as to the factors which support social entrepreneurs we keep in mind the question: who grows as a social entrepreneur in times of adversity and who reprioritizes the notion of their career trajectory to focus more on self preservation. In 2008 Christopher Peterson (Peterson et al. 2008) demonstrated a positive correlation between the VIA-IS Character Strengths Inventory and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). The PTGI measures growth on the dimensions of Appreciation, New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Spiritual Enhancement and Personal Strength; interestingly, all of these dimensions are relevant for social entrepreneurial ideation. Comparing PTGI with the Character Strengths assessment we identify that Humor, Teamwork, Spirituality, Prudence and Judgement have a significant correlation for PTGI across the five sub-dimensions, see figures below.\n\nData validity questions. \nWe initially hypothesized that there would be a correlation between CS prepost (Character Strengths Difference in average scores assessed before/after the blast) and Post Traumatic Growth. While there seems to be a slight correlation between CS prepost and PTGI - Appreciation (.33 p-val .14) we cannot at this time with our limited data make any strong statements about Character Strength changes before/after an explosion and PTGI. One factor could be that the time frame for the post test was taken over a 3 month period (December - March 2020) and it might be interesting to study a progression of changes rather than comparing pre and post. Growth takes time and measuring over an extended period confuses the data. Also, assessing people earlier, and therefore closer to the period of the traumatic event may not have left time to metabolize the experience while people who filled in the assessment later have had more opportunities. Another bias that may be influencing the data is potentially the types of people who submit forms early compared to those who wait may also capture proactive people early in the recovery process and procrastinators later in their process. Rather than adding another factor to control for procrastination, I propose future assessments to include deadlines for inclusion into the dataset, or to include time of receipt as an influencing factor. \n \nAnd now, we begin to explore motivation and wellbeing for entrepreneurs following the Fight, Flight and Freeze framework. \nFight\nAfter the Beirut Explosion, many of the interviewees were feeling anger. Although anger may be seen as a negative state, we found that many of the participants used their anger towards a factor we called Revolutionary Ideation, clicking this link will take you to see sections of the interview tagged with this concept. \n\n“Angry at the government, of course. Angry that the city I love was destroyed. The nice things about our city were destroyed in a second because of the irresponsibility of the people governing. Of course I went to the protest that happened immediately after” - Interview 006\n\nSome people went to the streets to protest, while others viewed their entrepreneurial activity as their “action” in response: \n\n“With the revolution came many different revolutions... one of the revolutions we're making is in education. And I say that I'm an activist  and not on the ground - it's our revolution in education. I don't think the revolution is only about going down and doing it violently. It's about rethinking, unlearning, recreating. Putting aside everything traditional / forced upon us / trying to make a difference. not just to make money. Money is not the aim, it's the reward. It's not the reward I'm aiming for. The impact is the aim I want. There's lots, revolutions in media, education, revolution in feminism/sexuality. This awareness is coming out and has been a social revolution not only (taboo). Not just a gov /political revolution, it's everything. This is my revolution.”\n-Interview 019\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, the majority of participants with revolutionary ideation came from people who were not intending to leave Lebanon, even after the blast. While revolutionary thinking and political engagement is not the primary focus of this paper, it is worth being included here since many of the inspiration for social entrepreneurs comes from areas the public sector is lacking in, and can be seen as a form of direct action. Most of the social entrepreneurs interviewed for this paper were operating businesses solving problems in the domain of education. \n\nAnother important reason to consider the idea of “Fighting” and using the feeling of Anger is that it is a fact bound to happen, especially when paired with major traumatic events. So rather than avoiding the feeling, we can sublimate anger to increase the critical factor of engagement to prevent freezing, complacency, and inaction. While the language of fighting is not necessarily positive, it does imply a high degree of activation and purpose, something important to maintain in the face of conflict and insurmountable odds. \n\nThe measure we’ve selected for “Fight” is resilience, labeled BRCS  (Sinclair and Walston 2004), it measures the following questions on a 5 point scale:\n\t1\tI look for creative ways to alter difficult situations. \n\t2\tRegardless of what happens to me, I believe I can control my reaction to it. \n\t3\tI believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with difficult situations. \n\t4\tI actively look for ways to replace the losses I encounter in life.\n\nActing as an antidote to the potential freezing reflex, resilience inspires action and engagement. While focusing on character strengths development has been shown to support wellbeing factors described by PERMA (Goodman & Kauffman 2017), there appears to be a subset that stands out in our set of interviews. The components of this subset are the following : Hope, Humor, Self-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. We can see that these are especially correlated with resilience, and may be interesting to explore as in future studies. \nWhat might not support direct engagement? The following table presents negative correlations between Revolutionary Ideation that we can find identified in the data, there are no strong positive correlations to present. \n\n\nThe relationships that stand out to me are the relationship between Prudence, having a child and Revolutionary Ideation. Prudent parents are less likely to be engaged in protests and other types of activism. Another strong correlation is with Spirituality. Diving into how one mother responded to the explosion we can see both features at play:\n\n“No, nothing changed. God's will will still happen as it should. Nothing has changed. I worked as a mother to prevent the impact from impacting my children much so they don't stay home alone. I didn't have much capacity to go to the site to volunteer. Fadi my brother was there and saw the fire that became the blast and was more present. I personally focused on making sure my children would cross this situation without harm. Fadi worked on support.”\n-013 Interview Spirituality rank 7/24 & Has_Child True\n\nWhile the strength of Spirituality contributes positively to Post Traumatic Growth through the “Spiritual Enhancement” facet, there is a concern that over-focusing on the strength of spirituality could lead to spiritual bypassing, which is a coping strategy where people use spiritual ideas to avoid facing unresolved emotional issues and development tasks. Spiritual bypassing was coined by John Welwood and developed in (Cashwell, C. S., Glosoff, H. L., & Hammond, C. 2010).  \nInterviewee number 18 expressed the balance between trusting in the “Will of God” and developing and engaging in acts of control like this:\n“We do have control over that, if it's going to happen it's going to happen. If maybe we knew about it, maybe it's going to happen anyway. We're destined to have this. There's a saying in the (The Islamic Spiritual Tradition), aqqqalal (Arabic for use your brain/do something rational) watawakal (Arabic for rely on God) - before submitting (to the will of God) do what you have to do. DO what we should do and at the end of the day what's going to happen is going to happen.”\n-018 Interview \n\nFigure 6 in the figures section below displays an interesting chart exposing some relationships between meditation, spirituality, revolutionary / social ideation. Spirituality is correlated with not having a therapist perhaps indicating that people with a stronger spiritual practice don’t identify with the need to find a therapist. This is interesting because it seems that having a therapist correlates with deliberate rumination and meditation. Reviewing age seems to indicate that the younger generations are more open to therapy and meditation alongside their religious and spiritual beliefs. \n\nOne takeaway from the above analysis is that creating mixed communities of practice where various spiritual, religious, therapeutic ideas are shared openly might create an opportunity for alternative perspectives to be displayed and their results seen, either amplifying or dampening the ideas that the group selects as valuable. This might be an important task for course designers and facilitators to navigate carefully. 013 expressed a value in action by nurturing their child, while 019 demonstrated Bravery and a rallying cry to contribute socially in a time of revolutionary change. In relation to the theme of this section, both of them are putting up a good fight and are engaged in a values informed course of action.\n\nFlight\nTraumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous section we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to the blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40 percent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation (WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion will be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports that the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the blast. Understanding the decision making process of social entrepreneurs is critical since they are an important part of the population working on creating stability and creating positive reasons for people to stay, either through their services, as employees or customers. \n\nThis snippet of dialog from an interview demonstrates in real time holding multiple perspectives and ends with a contradiction, to desire to want to stay. \n\n“For instance if I had kids. If I was in Beirut/ lost a close family member I may have thought I would leave. Fortunately for me I don't’, it’s related to how much they can take. My brother is leaving for France in September, I can't leave everyone/my family. We have the family business, my father is relatively old. And I want to stay here willingly.”\n-004 Interview\n\nThe research strategy was initially going to divide the population into “those who stay and build” and “those who leave and protect themselves and their families” - during the coding process we found that the decision is emotional some people want to leave and contribute, and some want to stay and contribute, and many others have competing commitments that are unclear. Sometimes the interviewee demonstrates deep self knowledge and desires to leave for strategic reasons, to continue to be able to offer their work life as a service to their community they need to stay safe, sane and alive: \n\n“I won't lie, sometimes I feel like leaving too. Why do I think about it? To keep this engine/enthusiasm/giving to people I have to feel secure. Not that I will die at any instant. So much is online so I can do so much of my work online. I can be effective even if I’m not physically in the country. I think of my safety, my family… and my earnings. Now I’m fine. After a while will I still be fine? I’m investing from my income, will I still be able to invest in my team? That’s the one thing I’m thinking about. I’m investing in the base, raising this “child” so that one day the company will come and pay me back and take care of me when I’m older. Thank goodness God has given me a salary. I see tangible results. We’re going to print the book and sell it and make money from it. I can see it all. It's not like we’re playing and not doing anything.\n-002 Interview\n\nThis powerful snippet from the interview shows the strategic process 002 has taken to rationalize her potential departure from Lebanon. Some questions arise as to how much the combination of the massive spread of the coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown supports people in their migration ideation. It could be that as people have spent much of 2020 indoors people now, like 002, have taken their social entrepreneurship programs online and have less of a physical investment in their physical environments.\n\nOther interviewees have a clearer commitment to leaving and do not seem conflicted in any way:\n“I live with my mom/brother. And we are all affected by the situation of course. Because before that - the port - we already had the economic situation and we were feeling safe since a long time nothing happened security wise. we heard it could happen again. We don't feel safe anymore.\nI don't have foreign nationality, so I decided not to take a French one. It's complicated to find a job, it's a safe thing to do to have a possibility if one has to go outside Lebanon. I would be interested in leaving if I had an opportunity. Someone said for Canada. Someone said it's very far and they don't take Lebanese for my age. For security reasons I could go to France for example. It's a sure avenue, I need a challenge in my life. I don't like routine.”\n-Interview 017\n\n“Participants who maintain calm and develop adaptive self-regulating practices  Actually my thinking is everyone is thinking about leaving. Something inside me that doesn't want to leave despite everything. I don't know why I'm still calm. I see the craziness all around us. The best thing you can do is focus with what you have, and how you can help others with what you have. If you focus on all the bad things around us you can't work. What I decided is to help and doing what I can do and keeping my mental health and family health and that's how to survive everything. Of course we felt very bad and it was very stressful for us and all these feelings. I just wanted to stay calm.”\n-014 Interview\n\nAlbert Bandura’s Social Cognition Theory (Bandura 1989) proposes that a portion of knowledge acquisition comes from social evaluation, from our data we see that people modulate their migration ideation based on many factors, one of which is how and who they speak to about it. Traumatic events disrupt the standard narrative model needing new stories to support meaning, suggests Neimeyer in (Neimeyer, R. A. (2004), how are those narratives reconstructed? In a paper developing a model of Post Traumatic Growth for cancer patients (Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011) identified Deliberate Rumination as a strong influencing factor for PTG. Further research demonstrated the relationship between PTG and life satisfaction through the factor of meaning:\n\nIn the paper (Triplett et al. - 2012), they demonstrated that the disruption of core beliefs (CBIs) triggers both intrusive and deliberate rumination and that the destabilizing aspects of a traumatic event either supports a more meaningful life of satisfaction through deliberately contemplating the experience, or can negatively affect meaning and life satisfaction through intrusive rumination. \n\nDeliberate Rumination is the process of choosing the questions and thoughts one has around a traumatic event, for instance “what is the lesson I am learning through this” in contrast with Intrusive Rumination and Brooding which may take the tone of “why is this always happening to me”. We can see both examples in our interview data set. Observe as 018 reflects on discussions had during a group dialog with other social entrepreneurs in the entrepreneurial training program:\n“...First I was thinking if we stay in this country, I can do anything in this country. Nothing limiting me, why would I leave this country.... Why ... maybe I should have a backup country if something unexpected happens. Just having this backup country in mind can help me (with my project). … Then(the start of the program) (projectName) (personName) starting asking which country do you want to go to? And I started thinking, first that ... I have friends, good nature, why leave? Then after the blast I have a different perspective of the country and started thinking of where I can go when/if something unexpected happens.”\n--018 Interview\nOther examples of social cognition supporting someone positively through social media and describing the importance of having a community of positive social support to help create a sense of control and meaning as he adjusts his worldview through the development of spiritual and meditative practices: \n“A lot lot lot lot. After the blast I was majorly helped - writing affirmations. It helped me so much. I was in complete loss, not knowing what's happening, what the point of anything is. Self existence questions that you ask yourself. One of the major affirmations, I am control of my reality even in times of uncertainty.\nThere's a beautiful instagram, called affirmation addict. Girl in California, I don't have the application. I have a journal. I have a routine. Every two weeks. I cleanse my home with spiritual music. I started yoga. More meditation. I did a retreat for 5 days [...]\nI always have curiosity to learn more about these. They came at the right time. I have friends who are more spiritual bess (but) i'm doing it alone. At my own pace. I have a collective of friends around me that I'm inspired by.”\n-020 Interview\n\nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first established can potentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths which support individuals' sense of life satisfaction and overall wellbeing is hypothesized to set a state of mind conducive to positive Deliberate Rumination. \nThe set of character strengths associated with our Deliberate Rumination dimension is Judgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. These traits do intuitively make sense as critical factors for deliberate rumination and working together as a community to make difficult collective decisions about traveling, building and relationships. We hope that by bringing a greater awareness to these strengths of character people and programs will benefit from clearer thinking and more open discussion on what to do after difficulties arise. \nFreeze… or Laugh\nThe third  response individuals have in the face of an overwhelmingly negative situation is to freeze. In our interviews, we identify initial stages after the blast where many people felt stuck through expressing feelings of exasperation and frustration at the situation. Indicating they sense a loss of control. These aspects connect to Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) through negating the opposite, post traumatic stress. Some of the symptoms of PTS are freezing, feeling numbness, an inability to act or care, holding one’s breath, a sense of dread… \n\nWhile it’s important not to overstate the case of PTS, in fact, most people respond quite resiliently as proposed by (Bonanno, G. A. 2004), also in order for people to experience the positive effects of PTG even the challenges and stressors of ordinary life can be enough of a trigger to stimulate benefits (Ewert, A., & Tessneer, S. 2019). Before exploring people’s stress let’s explore the positive correlations between PTGI and Character Strengths:\n\nThe majority of the connection comes through the facet of PTGI-Appreciation. \n\n\n “...It's useless, they are not serving us by doing this. (Sharing news about the situation) They are producing anger that can't turn into anything. The people are already angry from the economic issue. They don't have proof. One can sit and do theories for hours.”\n017 Interview \n\n“Khalas(exasperated form of “enough” in Arabic). I can't control anything… I need to control my feelings thoughts rage. \n-020 Interview\n\nAfter a month, yeah. In the first month I was consuming a lot of news about it and then I decided to stop. I was just depressing myself and I couldn't do anything about it and I disconnected completely and living my life as if nothing was going on. [[Code: Response-Self Protection]] I wasn't in Beirut, It wasn't as traumatic I was in Sawfar\n006 Interview \n\n“I didn't force myself to deal, when I wanted to cry. I was crying, when I didn't feel willing to do anything I didn't do anything.”\n010 Interview\n\nRather than freezing in response, some of the interviewees exhibited avoidant behaviors, which parallel freezing:\n\n“After the blast I didn't go to Beirut until just now. It was too heartbreaking, I didn't want to see it. We were impacted from the protests and the views. I was in a state of denial I didn't want to believe that this has happened. I only went yesterday because I //HAD// to get a vaccine. In some buildings you see the effects of the blast, in other buildings it's been cleaned up.”\n010 Interview\n\nContrast the preceding statements with following statements which demonstrate interviewees engaging in highly motivated activities following the explosion:\n\n“When the blast happened, most businesses closed and people were cleaning up... When I was in gbeili - company, not antwork. I was looking at the employees and was thinking, don't you want to be in beirut helping other people? You could just go there and do something, this paperwork could be done another day.”\n019 Interview \n\n“I still have nightmares, I have PTSD. Do you really want to know what it's like? I had some calls with people from projectName. And suddenly the glass office I was in all collapsed and the couch I was sitting on was full of glass. Allah itlatuf (God intervened with mercy) it was a matter of minutes. I was caught up on my way down to the floor below with my manager having a silly discussion when the blast happened. And the whole lower floor was full of blood, everyone had to be taken to the hospital. We were so scared to move. Because there were two we expected a third. We all thought we were being blasted. Because of this we created a (product in response), it was a determination for us that (curseword) it we're staying. We're doing this for the country despite all the (curse) we're living through. It was created after the blast as a demonstration that we want to manufacture here, we want to create jobs, we want to build something for the kids that are deprived of toys, their childhood even.” https://roamresearch.com/#/app/EntrepreneurialResearch/page/ISYEjUAMD\n\nAggregating the pre-post tests from all the assessments we have before and after the blast, we found that by segmenting our assessments by individuals in the entrepreneurial training program, they have - on average - a one point increase in the measure of Humor in the VIA-IS inventory, over the course of the program. While Humor may be under-studied in academia, it correlates with the CS prepost variable in our dataset. \n “CS Prepost” is a measure of the overall change in Character Strength before and after the Beirut Port Explosion. In the following table, we observe that humor and creativity both are factors affecting the preservation of Character Strengths. We used JASP and a classical regression matrix since the variables are all continuous variables.  \n\nSo what is a theory behind humor and this buffering effect? Humor has been linked to adaptive coping and keeping a “light attitude” in the face of adversity (Ruch and Hofmann 2017). Humor is also an active response to take when other options are unavailable: people “break” the silence with laughter, for example. This may be preventing the processes which lead to Learned Helplessness. Learned helplessness is one way to view the opposite of post traumatic growth for people living in highly chaotic and destabilized situations. Initially Learned Helplessness theory implied that dogs experiencing inescapable shocks learned helplessness and persisted in helpless behavior even when the situation became escapable later. \n\nRecent research has shed light on the neurological underpinnings of learned helplessness which has application in uncertain times (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). Previously Learned Helplessness, as the name suggests, theorized that higher level mammals learn helpless behaviors when they are given inescapable negative experiences. Passivity in the face of a changed situation, a situation where it behooves the animal to take action, is the hallmark of learned helplessness. And while that behavior doesn’t change, our understanding of how it comes to be has. Mammals, when confronted with prolonged adverse situations, develop an unlearned response of passivity. It is possible to overcome this bias towards passivity by learning and exerting control. What behaviors are available to act on?\n\nOne additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory (Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive activities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities and capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with the neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of character strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost). Humor stands out as one of the only factors that is directly connected to growth and stands out as a unique lens to look at both PTG(PTGI) and Resilience(BRCS) as it ties them all together as can be seen in the following chart:  \nThe court jester is the only person able to speak the truth when there is a crippling fear gripping the court. Humor breaks the ice and we propose that it may also help sustain the neurological basis for control. Humor is one of the factors we are exploring in this paper along the dimension of growth, the other is self reflection and emotional reappraisal through Deliberate Rumination and the third is Engagement as manifested in anger/political action as well as social entrepreneurial ideation. \nHumor, Engagement & Deliberate Rumination\nDiscussion\n4.1 Implications and future directions\n4.2 Limitations \nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we investigated the Character Strength correlations with Resilience, Post Traumatic Growth and Deliberate Rumination. Since Character Strengths are correlated with Post Traumatic Growth and Wellbeing, and since there is a collection of applied interventions with scientific validity, we hope this analysis helps educators working inside and outside conflict. The idea of “pre-silience” (pre+resilience) applies here with the recommendations for actions being more helpful in situations before there is a traumatic event. \nLet’s review the frame and identify the correlated character strengths:\n\nHeading\n\nSDT\nMeasure -> Support\nCorrelated Character Strengths\nFight \nEngagement anger/political social entrepreneurial ideation. \n\nAutonomy\nResilience -> Engagement\nHope, Humor, Self-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. \nFlight\nDeliberate Rumination\nself reflection and emotional reappraisal\nRelatedness\nDeliberate Rumination -> Dialog\nJudgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. \nFreeze\nGrowth  Humor\nCompetency\nPTGI -> Growth\nAppreciation of Beauty, Fairness, Humor, Judgement, Leadership, Modesty/Humility, Perspective, Prudence, Social Intelligence, Spirituality and Teamwork\n\nThe strengths that correlate with motivation and wellbeing with the highest correlations are Teamwork, Social Intelligence and Judgement. \n\nThe total list of strengths which emerged from our analysis is:\n\t1\tAppreciation of Beauty\n\t2\tFairness\n\t3\tHope\n\t4\tHumor\n\t5\tJudgement \n\t6\tLeadership\n\t7\tModesty/Humility\n\t8\tPrudence\n\t9\tPerspective\n\t10\tSelf-Regulation\n\t11\tSocial Intelligence\n\t12\tSpirituality \n\t13\tTeamwork \n\nEveryone makes different decisions after a traumatic event, one size does not fit all in terms of how best to design a pedagogy for social entrepreneurs. We hope this paper inspires more exploration around increasing motivation and wellbeing before the traumatic event, generating “presilience” so that when challenges come the psychological and social support are already in place. \n\nOne thing is becoming more clear, it’s important to create spaces for truth speaking in the social entrepreneurship community, we must talk about our failures and fears as well as our successes. These spaces can be where people explore ways of being and inspire each other through positive open discussion around Character Strengths. These spaces could be a counter to the negativity bias seen on both social and traditional media. They offer a facilitated space to practice deliberate rumination with the positive guidance of facilitators. It also supports the spread of value-laden idioms, aphorisms, and other easily digestible ideas, which become heuristics for decision making. \n\nThe Character Strengths above come from a small sample study and the correlations do not imply causation. I hope this paper inspires others to take an applied approach to character strengths explorations and also publish their data openly to build up a stronger evidence base for Character Strengths interventions. \n\nI hope these findings make their way into communities of practice where social entrepreneurs can collectively support each other to create the next viable steady-state system wherever they are. \nI want to end with two insights, one from one of the participants of the study and one from a famous author:\n\n“...Values are the base of every human reaction and really, there's courage and motivation in every person that's hidden and this very sad event created or awakened values in people. Those of compassion and courage, of motivation of solidarity and nationalism. Inspire nationalism even as people as they leaving the country. The people that are leaving the country, they still say my dream is to come back one day to Lebanon. \nMaybe they will go and come back.”\n--Interview 017\n\n “If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” \n-Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\n\n\t•\tStrengths to develop. The character strengths that have a developmental trajectory; that is, they are least common in youth and need to increase over time through cognitive maturation are: appreciation of beauty & excellence, forgiveness, modesty, open-mindedness (Park & Peterson, 2006a; 2006b).\n\n\n\nIn (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve, C. L. 2011) the researchers described the nodes in the dynamical system of someone going through a traumatic experience as Core Beliefs. Previous research by Christopher Peterson has demonstrated that improvements in Character Strengths are correlated with improvements in the Post Traumatic Growth Index, for people that experience major life difficulties (Peterson 2008). And, importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their strengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018). \n\nThis inquiry eventually allowed us to identify factors which support social entrepreneurs along the three dimensions of responding to the blast: fighting, fleeing or freezing. We’ve mapped them to the Self Determination Theory (SDT) of Motivation (Deci & Ryan 2008) (Autonomy, Mastery and Relatedness). \n\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially described by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory has since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This model now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses to neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an individual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of responses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues that the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018). \n\nIn 2008 it was demonstrated that an overall growth in the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory was correlated with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (Peterson et al. 2008). Traumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous section we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\n\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to the blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40 percent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation (WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion will be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports that the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the blast. One additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory (Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive activities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities and capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with the neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of character strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost).\nThe first sentence of the first paragraph should pick up some or most of the words from the title. You need to articulate the issue your paper addresses within the first three sentences to satisfy the expectations of your readers and maintain their attention. For the opening sentence of the introduction, be sure to avoid sweeping generalizations\nThe second paragraph of the introduction should provide a context and motivation for the current investigation. Typically, there are two reasons to write a paper: the study or ex- periment is the logical next step in a line of in- vestigation, or prior studies have been some- how deficient in some way that the current study addresses. You should decide which rationale best justifies your study. If it is the first reason, then the literature review should focus on the most important two to four articles (you can reference many more if you like), and show how this line of investigation has led to your study. If the reason is the inadequacy of previous studies, then the two to four most im- portant studies should be cited and their deficiencies explicitly stated. You will try to jus- tify your contentions by means of examples, proofs, or reasons, or by providing a narrative unfolding of the details or intricacies of the is- sue. As a rule, avoid referring to papers using author names (e.g., Anderson, Lee, and Wilson report in their 1967 study that...). Such strings of proper names tend to slow the pace of the writing and become altogether too cumbersome. Rather, state the point you want to make about the study and reference it with a number at the end of the sentence.\nThe third paragraph of the introduction should open with the explicit statement of the overarching reason your study is needed, drawing from the preceding paragraph. The last sentence of this paragraph should begin, “The purpose of this study was to...” Readers have a very strong and fixed expectation that the purpose of the study will be found in last sentence of the last paragraph of the introduc- tion.

In this context, our research examines the experiences of education-oriented social entrepreneurs in Lebanon, who faced significant challenges due to a currency devaluation, political instability, and a devastating explosion in Beirut.\n\nDeveloping educational experiences that promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) is critical to fostering an anti-fragile society. This study explores the factors contributing to the continued efforts of social entrepreneurs amidst these crises, highlighting the importance of humor, character strengths, and deliberate rumination.\n\nContext and Motivation\n\nThe 2020 Beirut Port Explosion, coupled with the global pandemic and economic collapse, brought acute stressors to Lebanon. Our research focuses on social entrepreneurs undergoing an entrepreneurship training program in Beirut, aiming to identify factors supporting their access to PTG. Through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative assessments, we analyze the resilience and character strengths that facilitate growth.\n\nPrior studies have shown the correlation between character strengths and PTG, but the unique context of Lebanon's multiple crises offers a novel perspective. This study addresses the need to understand how educational programs can nurture character strengths and promote deliberate rumination to support social entrepreneurs in crisis.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the factors promoting post-traumatic growth (PTG) to support educators working in crisis environments. By identifying character strengths and deliberate rumination as critical components, we aim to offer insights that can inform the development of anti-fragile educational programs for social entrepreneurs.\n\n17:44\nBilal Ghalib Research Project.pdf\nPDF\nACSI End of Program Review.pdf\nPDF\nBilal Literature Review.pdf\nPDF\nBilal Ghalib Preliminary TOC and Data.pdf\nPDF\nLet's derive some insights from the documents to improve my paper. What new concepts or new, unique insights that you think I can contribute to the academic literature can you find in these documents?\n17:44\nChatGPT\nAfter analyzing the provided documents, several new concepts and unique insights can be derived that could contribute to the academic literature on resilience, post-traumatic growth, and social entrepreneurship, especially in conflict zones. Here are some potential contributions:\n\n1. The Role of Humor in Post-Traumatic Growth\nInsight: The research identifies humor as a significant character strength that supports post-traumatic growth (PTG). Humor helps in preventing feelings of helplessness and fosters a positive environment that can promote resilience and innovation among social entrepreneurs.\n\nContribution: Investigating the specific mechanisms through which humor contributes to PTG and resilience in conflict zones could add valuable insights. This might include how humor moderates stress responses and encourages adaptive coping strategies among entrepreneurs.\n\n2. Deliberate Rumination and Narrative Reconstruction\nInsight: The documents highlight the importance of deliberate rumination, which involves reflective thinking about one’s life circumstances, as a factor that supports PTG. This contrasts with intrusive rumination, which is often detrimental.\n\nContribution: Exploring the role of deliberate rumination in narrative reconstruction after traumatic events could provide new understanding into how entrepreneurs rebuild their personal and professional lives. This could include developing interventions that facilitate deliberate rumination to promote resilience and entrepreneurial intent.\n\n3. The Impact of Social Support on Entrepreneurial Resilience\nInsight: Social support is repeatedly mentioned as a critical factor for resilience and PTG among social entrepreneurs. The presence of supportive networks can buffer the negative impacts of trauma and foster a sense of community and shared purpose.\n\nContribution: Examining the specific types and sources of social support that are most effective in conflict zones can offer practical guidelines for creating support systems for entrepreneurs. This could also involve studying the interplay between social support, resilience, and entrepreneurial success.\n\n4. Spirituality and Resilience\nInsight: The documents discuss spirituality as a double-edged sword. While spirituality can contribute positively to PTG through spiritual enhancement, there is a risk of spiritual bypassing, where individuals use spiritual ideas to avoid dealing with unresolved emotional issues.\n\nContribution: A nuanced investigation into how spirituality interacts with resilience and entrepreneurial outcomes could provide a balanced view. This might involve identifying practices that support genuine spiritual growth and resilience without leading to avoidance behaviors.\n\n5. Polyvagal Theory in Entrepreneurial Contexts\nInsight: The research uses Polyvagal Theory to frame responses to traumatic events, categorizing them as fight, flight, or freeze. This model helps in understanding the varied responses of entrepreneurs to stress and trauma.\n\nContribution: Applying Polyvagal Theory to entrepreneurial behavior in conflict zones could be a novel contribution. This could include studying how different stress responses affect entrepreneurial decision-making, innovation, and long-term business sustainability.\n\n6. Character Strengths Development through Entrepreneurial Programs\nInsight: Character strengths such as hope, humor, self-regulation, social intelligence, and teamwork are highlighted as crucial for resilience and PTG. The Bloom program’s buffering effect on participants' character strengths compared to non-participants is particularly noteworthy.\n\nContribution: Developing and validating character strengths interventions tailored for entrepreneurs in conflict zones could provide a valuable toolkit for educators and policymakers. This could include longitudinal studies to track the effectiveness of these interventions over time.\n\n7. Migration Ideation among Social Entrepreneurs\nInsight: The documents reveal complex decision-making processes regarding migration among social entrepreneurs, influenced by safety, economic stability, and a sense of duty towards their community.\n\nContribution: A detailed study on migration ideation among social entrepreneurs in conflict zones could offer insights into the factors that retain or repel entrepreneurial talent. This could help in designing policies and programs that address the root causes of migration and support local entrepreneurial ecosystems.\n\nBy integrating these insights into your paper, you can offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted exploration of the factors supporting resilience and post-traumatic growth in social entrepreneurs, particularly in conflict zones. These contributions could provide valuable theoretical and practical implications for future research and policy development.\n\n17:53\nGiven the type of research, and the size of the number of participants, and the limitations, list all the limitations, and then list all of the unique star-selling points of this research.\n17:53\nChatGPT\nLimitations of the Research\nSmall Sample Size: The research is based on a relatively small number of participants (21 social entrepreneurs), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to a larger population.\n\nGeographic and Contextual Specificity: The study is focused on social entrepreneurs in Lebanon, particularly in the context of the 2020 Beirut Port Explosion and the accompanying economic and political crises. This specific context may limit the applicability of the findings to other regions or types of crises.\n\nTemporal Limitations: The post-test assessments were conducted over a three-month period, which may not capture long-term changes in character strengths and post-traumatic growth. The timing of the assessments might also affect the results due to varying degrees of trauma processing among participants.\n\nSelf-Reported Data: Much of the data relies on self-reported measures, which can be subject to biases such as social desirability bias, recall bias, and demand characteristics.\n\nLack of Control Group: While the study compares participants inside and outside the Bloom program, it lacks a true control group that did not experience any intervention, making it difficult to attribute changes solely to the program.\n\nQualitative Data Challenges: Qualitative interviews are subject to interpretative biases, and the coding process for qualitative data can introduce subjective elements that affect the consistency and reliability of the findings.\n\nUnforeseen Variables: The inductive approach to identifying variables means that some relevant factors may have been missed or inadequately explored, particularly those not initially considered.\n\nCultural Specificity: The cultural context of Lebanon, including its unique socio-political environment and religious landscape, may influence the findings in ways that are not easily transferable to other contexts.\n\nUnique Selling Points of the Research\nContextual Relevance: The study provides valuable insights into the experiences of social entrepreneurs in a highly volatile and crisis-ridden environment, offering practical implications for similar contexts globally.\n\nFocus on Post-Traumatic Growth: By examining PTG rather than just resilience or recovery, the research adds a positive dimension to the understanding of how individuals and communities can thrive after traumatic events.\n\nHolistic Approach: The integration of qualitative and quantitative methods provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing PTG and resilience, combining depth with breadth in the data analysis.\n\nInnovative Use of Character Strengths: The research highlights the role of specific character strengths, such as humor, in promoting PTG. This focus on strengths offers a constructive framework for developing interventions.\n\nApplication of Polyvagal Theory: The use of Polyvagal Theory to frame responses to trauma (fight, flight, freeze) is innovative in the context of social entrepreneurship and offers a new lens for understanding entrepreneurial behavior in crises.\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship Focus: The study’s focus on social entrepreneurs is unique, recognizing their potential as agents of change and stability in crisis contexts. This perspective underscores the importance of supporting social entrepreneurship in policy and practice.\n\nPractical Implications for Education and Training: The findings provide actionable insights for designing educational and training programs that promote resilience and PTG, with specific recommendations for incorporating humor and deliberate rumination.\n\nRich Qualitative Data: The in-depth interviews provide rich, contextualized insights into the lived experiences of participants, offering valuable narratives that can inform both theory and practice.\n\nMixed Communities of Practice: The research suggests the value of creating mixed communities where diverse spiritual, religious, and therapeutic ideas are shared, potentially enhancing collective resilience and growth.\n\nImpact on Migration Ideation: By exploring the complex decision-making processes around migration among social entrepreneurs, the study provides unique insights into factors that influence entrepreneurial commitment to their communities during crises.\n\nSupport for Policy Development: The findings can inform policies aimed at fostering social entrepreneurship, resilience, and PTG in conflict zones and crisis-affected areas, contributing to broader societal stability and recovery efforts.\n\nBy acknowledging the limitations and emphasizing these unique selling points, the research can position itself as a valuable contribution to the fields of resilience, PTG, and social entrepreneurship, particularly in volatile and crisis-prone environments.\n\n17:53\nWhat do you think would be the two most valuable, most academically viable and legitimate papers I could write that would have a strong impact on contributing to post-traumatic growth research?

It is in this context this research has been conducted with a group of education oriented social entrepreneurs working in Lebanon. During our qualitative and quantitative study our participants experienced a combination of challenges from a currency devaluation, political instability and a large explosion in the center of Beirut. \n\nWe believe that developing educational experiences which promote post traumatic growth in this context is critical to support the development of an anti-fragile society. Thus we offer this paper as a contribution exploring the factors which contribute to our participant’s continued efforts in their entrepreneurial initiatives. Being social entrepreneurs, they are the future of stability in society, creating employment and addressing fundamental needs connected to SDGs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Protective Properties of Group Laughter \nHumor, Character Strengths and Deliberate Rumination For Social Entrepreneurs in Lebanon in Crisis\nFactors Contributing to Post Traumatic Growth for Social Entrepreneurs in Crisis\nBackground: In 2020 the world was challenged by a global pandemic. In Lebanon, the addition of an economic collapse and a major explosion in the capital city brought acute stressors, triggering migration ideation. In this study, we identify factors that support social entrepreneur’s access to post traumatic growth (PTG) by analyzing resilience and character strengths within an entrepreneurship training program in Beirut. \nMethods:  Over the course of Dec 2020 and April 2021 we gathered 21 hours and a half interviews with Lebanese social entrepreneurs going through an entrepreneurship training program, all of whom were living in Lebanon and experienced the August 2020 Beirut port explosion. Alongside these interviews we gathered a set of qualitative data including pre-post assessments of Character Strengths (VIA), Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTG-I), Intrusive and Deliberate Rumination (EERI), Entrepreneurial Intent (EI), Resilience (BRCS) and the Impact of Event - Revised (IES-R). Correlations were identified with factors that support PTG and social entrepreneurial ideation. \nResults: Character Strengths are correlated with PTG and there are validated methods for reliably developing strengths of character. One highly leverable strength is humor, and one way humor can support growth is by preventing helplessness. \nConclusions: While each person’s life journey is unique, we have identified that social entrepreneurship ideation is promoted by prior traumatic experiences if followed by opportunities and support for growth. Traumatic experiences are inescapable in life, and the opportunity educators and trainers have is to understand how to shift the trauma response curve towards growth. Deliberate Rumination, thinking and reflecting about one’s life circumstances can happen spontaneously and importantly they can be nurtured by incorporating them into group facilitations for training programs and schools. \nImplications:  The results of this study increases an understanding of the complex decision making individuals face in a crisis, and offers insights into the factors which support posttraumatic growth and social entrepreneurship. We hope the results of this paper inspire facilitators to incorporate humor, positive structured conversation and to enliven their program with character development. \nKeywords: Post Traumatic Growth, Social Entrepreneurship, Trauma, Lebanon, Training and Education, Character Strengths\nIntroduction: \nTrauma conscious pedagogies (Mays 2021) are becoming a widespread topic amongst educators in a post-covid-19 world, and in this paper we explore some factors and methodologies that can support growth during times of collective crisis. In 2020 the Lebanese people experienced the coronavirus pandemic, economic crisis as well as an explosion at the Beirut Port which killed over 200 people and left over 300,000 homeless in its wake. Working as an educator with social entrepreneurs in Lebanon we observed a growing frustration with the idea of resilience, with participants seeing it as a passive way oppressors remain in power while the population deals with the consequences of their mistakes. Rather than bounce back, we  began to explore the factors which promote Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) looking beyond resilience and recovery. We ask how can educators going through times of crisis promote anti-fragility, the ability to use difficulties as opportunities for growth?\n\nPeople respond differently to traumatic events and people’s Character Strengths can provide a framework to understand those responses as well as which traits may support individuals through times of crisis. Character Strengths are 24 relatively stable positive qualities in humans identified through a cross cultural analysis of what makes life worth living. Certain character strengths like kindness, social intelligence and hope have been demonstrated to protect against the negative effects of stress and trauma (Harzer 2015). It was also demonstrated that an overall growth in the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory is correlated with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (Peterson et al. 2008). Importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their strengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018). Assessing the behaviors that promote PTG and life satisfaction, we find deliberate rumination as an important vector. (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve, C. L. 2011) \n\nThe purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the factors that promote Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) to support educators working in environments undergoing crisis. Social enterprise support efforts are often funded and established in areas of need and therefore often the participants of these programs are likely to experience difficulties. add our evidence reinforcing the idea that nurturing character strengths as a whole, and hope, judgment, teamwork and humor in particular may increase the likelihood of growth after traumatic events. Previous studies demonstrate that Deliberate Rumination is a contributing factor for PTG and we have been able to identify judgment and teamwork as correlated Character Strengths. Lastly we recommend programs operating in areas and times of crisis to explore interventions to nurture the buffering Character Strengths of hope and humor while cultivating a group dynamic that can promote judgment and teamwork. \n\n\nTHE REST IS NEEDING TO BE CLEANED UP:\nMethodology\nWe’ve used a qualitative analysis method for the exploration of our research, in an attempt to identify potentially unforeseen variables. The author of this paper has been able to utilize their position as the head of Research And Development at Bloom, an organization which operates social enterprise education programs. Prior to the Beirut Port Explosion in August 2020, the participants and applicants for the Bloom social entrepreneurship accelerator program had taken the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory (VIA-IS). At the conclusion of the four months long accelerator, and following the Beirut Explosion, all applicants to the program requested to complete a post-test VIA-IS inventory, those in the program and those not selected.\n\nAn analysis of the pre/post test data for the VIA-IS demonstrated a buffering effect experienced by individuals who were a part of the Bloom program, which led to in-program individuals maintaining their overall VIA average while individuals outside the program experienced a significant drop. To understand this phenomenon was the genesis of this research, and inspired the qualitative/quantitative research methodology described below.\n\nQualitative Analysis: \nThe qualitative analysis consisted of twenty one 1.5 hour long interviews, which were all conducted remotely and recorded digitally. The interviewees were split with 10 people coming from outside the training program and 11 people who had gone through the training program (marked as “In prog.”). The questions for the interview were segmented into the following themes:\nTopic\nKey Insight Explored\nIntroduction and Background\nWork habits and family entrepreneurial background\nEthnographic Questions\nWhat is their educational/ family's income level?\nEntrepreneurial Intent (EI)\nWhat is their level of commitment to entrepreneurship?\nImpact of Event Scale (IES-R)\nWhat was the level of impact of the Beirut Explosion?\nResilience (BRCS)\nWhat is their level of resilience?\nPost Traumatic Growth Index \n(PTGI)\nHow much did people grow after the Beirut Explosion?\nRumination Scales \nWhat is the ratio of deliberate and intrusive rumination?\nConcluding Statements\nWhat does entrepreneurship mean in places facing instability?\n\nThe interview consisted of open-ended questions as well as questions requesting a qualitative response. Both questions were answered live on the call, allowing the interviewee to offer deeper context into the numerical responses. The audio for the interviews were transcribed manually, and an inductive process was followed to derive codes. The interview corpus was then brought into a software supporting bi-directional links through which code clusters were identified.\n\nQuantitative Data: \nDuring the semi-structured interview process, alongside the open-ended questions, the interviewer also gathered quantitative answers for the following measures:\n\t1\tPost Traumatic Growth Index (PTGI Tedeschi & Calhoun 1996)\n\t2\tThe Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS Sinclair and Wallson 2004)\n\t3\tThe Impact of Event Scale: Revised (IES-R DS Weiss 2007)\n\t4\tThe Intrusive - Event Related Rumination Inventory (EERI Cann et al., 2011)\n\t5\tEntrepreneurial Intention (EI) scale derived from Luthje & Frank (2003); Duijn (2009) / Krueger et al. (2000)\n\t6\tThe VIA Inventory referenced above. Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2004)\n\nA subset of the codes derived from the interview corpus were identified as meaningful segmentation markers, and each interview was then tagged in the database for analysis with the observed value.\n\nSegmentation Tags:\nProperty\nFields\nDescription\nHas_Therepist\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the individual attend therapy?\nInjury_From_Blast\nTrue/False/Unsure\nWas the interviewee injured in the Beirut Port Explosion?\nEntrepreneurial_Family\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the interviewee come from an entrepreneurial family?\nPlacebuilding_Ideation \nTrue/False/Unsure\nIs the interviewee committed to using their working life to contribute to society?\nMigration_Ideation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nIs the interviewee considering migrating out of Lebanon?\nRevolutionary_Ideation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the interviewee politically active, engage in protests, view their work as activism?\nIncome_Simplified\nLower/Middle/Upper\nHow does the participant view their families income bracket?\nMeditation\nTrue/False/Unsure\nDoes the participant have an active meditation practice?\nResults\nOverview of Data and Background Knowledge\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially described by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory has since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This model now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses to neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an individual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of responses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues that the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018). \nBefore we get into the analysis of the data, please review the prior description of the data and data gathering phase. If you would like to explore the data yourself, you can find a public dataset available to review here: http://bit.ly/cs-data-21 \n\nThe Character Strengths data was gathered as part of the application process for a social entrepreneurship program before the August 4th, 2020 explosion. After the explosion, to understand deeper changes in entrepreneurial ideation we conducted a second VIA-IS as well as a new questionnaire using the new measures described above. To start the exploration as to the factors which support social entrepreneurs we keep in mind the question: who grows as a social entrepreneur in times of adversity and who reprioritizes the notion of their career trajectory to focus more on self preservation. In 2008 Christopher Peterson (Peterson et al. 2008) demonstrated a positive correlation between the VIA-IS Character Strengths Inventory and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). The PTGI measures growth on the dimensions of Appreciation, New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Spiritual Enhancement and Personal Strength; interestingly, all of these dimensions are relevant for social entrepreneurial ideation. Comparing PTGI with the Character Strengths assessment we identify that Humor, Teamwork, Spirituality, Prudence and Judgement have a significant correlation for PTGI across the five sub-dimensions, see figures below.\n\nData validity questions. \nWe initially hypothesized that there would be a correlation between CS prepost (Character Strengths Difference in average scores assessed before/after the blast) and Post Traumatic Growth. While there seems to be a slight correlation between CS prepost and PTGI - Appreciation (.33 p-val .14) we cannot at this time with our limited data make any strong statements about Character Strength changes before/after an explosion and PTGI. One factor could be that the time frame for the post test was taken over a 3 month period (December - March 2020) and it might be interesting to study a progression of changes rather than comparing pre and post. Growth takes time and measuring over an extended period confuses the data. Also, assessing people earlier, and therefore closer to the period of the traumatic event may not have left time to metabolize the experience while people who filled in the assessment later have had more opportunities. Another bias that may be influencing the data is potentially the types of people who submit forms early compared to those who wait may also capture proactive people early in the recovery process and procrastinators later in their process. Rather than adding another factor to control for procrastination, I propose future assessments to include deadlines for inclusion into the dataset, or to include time of receipt as an influencing factor. \n \nAnd now, we begin to explore motivation and wellbeing for entrepreneurs following the Fight, Flight and Freeze framework. \nFight\nAfter the Beirut Explosion, many of the interviewees were feeling anger. Although anger may be seen as a negative state, we found that many of the participants used their anger towards a factor we called Revolutionary Ideation, clicking this link will take you to see sections of the interview tagged with this concept. \n\n“Angry at the government, of course. Angry that the city I love was destroyed. The nice things about our city were destroyed in a second because of the irresponsibility of the people governing. Of course I went to the protest that happened immediately after” - Interview 006\n\nSome people went to the streets to protest, while others viewed their entrepreneurial activity as their “action” in response: \n\n“With the revolution came many different revolutions... one of the revolutions we're making is in education. And I say that I'm an activist  and not on the ground - it's our revolution in education. I don't think the revolution is only about going down and doing it violently. It's about rethinking, unlearning, recreating. Putting aside everything traditional / forced upon us / trying to make a difference. not just to make money. Money is not the aim, it's the reward. It's not the reward I'm aiming for. The impact is the aim I want. There's lots, revolutions in media, education, revolution in feminism/sexuality. This awareness is coming out and has been a social revolution not only (taboo). Not just a gov /political revolution, it's everything. This is my revolution.”\n-Interview 019\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, the majority of participants with revolutionary ideation came from people who were not intending to leave Lebanon, even after the blast. While revolutionary thinking and political engagement is not the primary focus of this paper, it is worth being included here since many of the inspiration for social entrepreneurs comes from areas the public sector is lacking in, and can be seen as a form of direct action. Most of the social entrepreneurs interviewed for this paper were operating businesses solving problems in the domain of education. \n\nAnother important reason to consider the idea of “Fighting” and using the feeling of Anger is that it is a fact bound to happen, especially when paired with major traumatic events. So rather than avoiding the feeling, we can sublimate anger to increase the critical factor of engagement to prevent freezing, complacency, and inaction. While the language of fighting is not necessarily positive, it does imply a high degree of activation and purpose, something important to maintain in the face of conflict and insurmountable odds. \n\nThe measure we’ve selected for “Fight” is resilience, labeled BRCS  (Sinclair and Walston 2004), it measures the following questions on a 5 point scale:\n\t1\tI look for creative ways to alter difficult situations. \n\t2\tRegardless of what happens to me, I believe I can control my reaction to it. \n\t3\tI believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with difficult situations. \n\t4\tI actively look for ways to replace the losses I encounter in life.\n\nActing as an antidote to the potential freezing reflex, resilience inspires action and engagement. While focusing on character strengths development has been shown to support wellbeing factors described by PERMA (Goodman & Kauffman 2017), there appears to be a subset that stands out in our set of interviews. The components of this subset are the following : Hope, Humor, Self-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. We can see that these are especially correlated with resilience, and may be interesting to explore as in future studies. \nWhat might not support direct engagement? The following table presents negative correlations between Revolutionary Ideation that we can find identified in the data, there are no strong positive correlations to present. \n\n\nThe relationships that stand out to me are the relationship between Prudence, having a child and Revolutionary Ideation. Prudent parents are less likely to be engaged in protests and other types of activism. Another strong correlation is with Spirituality. Diving into how one mother responded to the explosion we can see both features at play:\n\n“No, nothing changed. God's will will still happen as it should. Nothing has changed. I worked as a mother to prevent the impact from impacting my children much so they don't stay home alone. I didn't have much capacity to go to the site to volunteer. Fadi my brother was there and saw the fire that became the blast and was more present. I personally focused on making sure my children would cross this situation without harm. Fadi worked on support.”\n-013 Interview Spirituality rank 7/24 & Has_Child True\n\nWhile the strength of Spirituality contributes positively to Post Traumatic Growth through the “Spiritual Enhancement” facet, there is a concern that over-focusing on the strength of spirituality could lead to spiritual bypassing, which is a coping strategy where people use spiritual ideas to avoid facing unresolved emotional issues and development tasks. Spiritual bypassing was coined by John Welwood and developed in (Cashwell, C. S., Glosoff, H. L., & Hammond, C. 2010).  \nInterviewee number 18 expressed the balance between trusting in the “Will of God” and developing and engaging in acts of control like this:\n“We do have control over that, if it's going to happen it's going to happen. If maybe we knew about it, maybe it's going to happen anyway. We're destined to have this. There's a saying in the (The Islamic Spiritual Tradition), aqqqalal (Arabic for use your brain/do something rational) watawakal (Arabic for rely on God) - before submitting (to the will of God) do what you have to do. DO what we should do and at the end of the day what's going to happen is going to happen.”\n-018 Interview \n\nFigure 6 in the figures section below displays an interesting chart exposing some relationships between meditation, spirituality, revolutionary / social ideation. Spirituality is correlated with not having a therapist perhaps indicating that people with a stronger spiritual practice don’t identify with the need to find a therapist. This is interesting because it seems that having a therapist correlates with deliberate rumination and meditation. Reviewing age seems to indicate that the younger generations are more open to therapy and meditation alongside their religious and spiritual beliefs. \n\nOne takeaway from the above analysis is that creating mixed communities of practice where various spiritual, religious, therapeutic ideas are shared openly might create an opportunity for alternative perspectives to be displayed and their results seen, either amplifying or dampening the ideas that the group selects as valuable. This might be an important task for course designers and facilitators to navigate carefully. 013 expressed a value in action by nurturing their child, while 019 demonstrated Bravery and a rallying cry to contribute socially in a time of revolutionary change. In relation to the theme of this section, both of them are putting up a good fight and are engaged in a values informed course of action.\n\nFlight\nTraumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous section we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to the blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40 percent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation (WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion will be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports that the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the blast. Understanding the decision making process of social entrepreneurs is critical since they are an important part of the population working on creating stability and creating positive reasons for people to stay, either through their services, as employees or customers. \n\nThis snippet of dialog from an interview demonstrates in real time holding multiple perspectives and ends with a contradiction, to desire to want to stay. \n\n“For instance if I had kids. If I was in Beirut/ lost a close family member I may have thought I would leave. Fortunately for me I don't’, it’s related to how much they can take. My brother is leaving for France in September, I can't leave everyone/my family. We have the family business, my father is relatively old. And I want to stay here willingly.”\n-004 Interview\n\nThe research strategy was initially going to divide the population into “those who stay and build” and “those who leave and protect themselves and their families” - during the coding process we found that the decision is emotional some people want to leave and contribute, and some want to stay and contribute, and many others have competing commitments that are unclear. Sometimes the interviewee demonstrates deep self knowledge and desires to leave for strategic reasons, to continue to be able to offer their work life as a service to their community they need to stay safe, sane and alive: \n\n“I won't lie, sometimes I feel like leaving too. Why do I think about it? To keep this engine/enthusiasm/giving to people I have to feel secure. Not that I will die at any instant. So much is online so I can do so much of my work online. I can be effective even if I’m not physically in the country. I think of my safety, my family… and my earnings. Now I’m fine. After a while will I still be fine? I’m investing from my income, will I still be able to invest in my team? That’s the one thing I’m thinking about. I’m investing in the base, raising this “child” so that one day the company will come and pay me back and take care of me when I’m older. Thank goodness God has given me a salary. I see tangible results. We’re going to print the book and sell it and make money from it. I can see it all. It's not like we’re playing and not doing anything.\n-002 Interview\n\nThis powerful snippet from the interview shows the strategic process 002 has taken to rationalize her potential departure from Lebanon. Some questions arise as to how much the combination of the massive spread of the coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown supports people in their migration ideation. It could be that as people have spent much of 2020 indoors people now, like 002, have taken their social entrepreneurship programs online and have less of a physical investment in their physical environments.\n\nOther interviewees have a clearer commitment to leaving and do not seem conflicted in any way:\n“I live with my mom/brother. And we are all affected by the situation of course. Because before that - the port - we already had the economic situation and we were feeling safe since a long time nothing happened security wise. we heard it could happen again. We don't feel safe anymore.\nI don't have foreign nationality, so I decided not to take a French one. It's complicated to find a job, it's a safe thing to do to have a possibility if one has to go outside Lebanon. I would be interested in leaving if I had an opportunity. Someone said for Canada. Someone said it's very far and they don't take Lebanese for my age. For security reasons I could go to France for example. It's a sure avenue, I need a challenge in my life. I don't like routine.”\n-Interview 017\n\n“Participants who maintain calm and develop adaptive self-regulating practices  Actually my thinking is everyone is thinking about leaving. Something inside me that doesn't want to leave despite everything. I don't know why I'm still calm. I see the craziness all around us. The best thing you can do is focus with what you have, and how you can help others with what you have. If you focus on all the bad things around us you can't work. What I decided is to help and doing what I can do and keeping my mental health and family health and that's how to survive everything. Of course we felt very bad and it was very stressful for us and all these feelings. I just wanted to stay calm.”\n-014 Interview\n\nAlbert Bandura’s Social Cognition Theory (Bandura 1989) proposes that a portion of knowledge acquisition comes from social evaluation, from our data we see that people modulate their migration ideation based on many factors, one of which is how and who they speak to about it. Traumatic events disrupt the standard narrative model needing new stories to support meaning, suggests Neimeyer in (Neimeyer, R. A. (2004), how are those narratives reconstructed? In a paper developing a model of Post Traumatic Growth for cancer patients (Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011) identified Deliberate Rumination as a strong influencing factor for PTG. Further research demonstrated the relationship between PTG and life satisfaction through the factor of meaning:\n\nIn the paper (Triplett et al. - 2012), they demonstrated that the disruption of core beliefs (CBIs) triggers both intrusive and deliberate rumination and that the destabilizing aspects of a traumatic event either supports a more meaningful life of satisfaction through deliberately contemplating the experience, or can negatively affect meaning and life satisfaction through intrusive rumination. \n\nDeliberate Rumination is the process of choosing the questions and thoughts one has around a traumatic event, for instance “what is the lesson I am learning through this” in contrast with Intrusive Rumination and Brooding which may take the tone of “why is this always happening to me”. We can see both examples in our interview data set. Observe as 018 reflects on discussions had during a group dialog with other social entrepreneurs in the entrepreneurial training program:\n“...First I was thinking if we stay in this country, I can do anything in this country. Nothing limiting me, why would I leave this country.... Why ... maybe I should have a backup country if something unexpected happens. Just having this backup country in mind can help me (with my project). … Then(the start of the program) (projectName) (personName) starting asking which country do you want to go to? And I started thinking, first that ... I have friends, good nature, why leave? Then after the blast I have a different perspective of the country and started thinking of where I can go when/if something unexpected happens.”\n--018 Interview\nOther examples of social cognition supporting someone positively through social media and describing the importance of having a community of positive social support to help create a sense of control and meaning as he adjusts his worldview through the development of spiritual and meditative practices: \n“A lot lot lot lot. After the blast I was majorly helped - writing affirmations. It helped me so much. I was in complete loss, not knowing what's happening, what the point of anything is. Self existence questions that you ask yourself. One of the major affirmations, I am control of my reality even in times of uncertainty.\nThere's a beautiful instagram, called affirmation addict. Girl in California, I don't have the application. I have a journal. I have a routine. Every two weeks. I cleanse my home with spiritual music. I started yoga. More meditation. I did a retreat for 5 days [...]\nI always have curiosity to learn more about these. They came at the right time. I have friends who are more spiritual bess (but) i'm doing it alone. At my own pace. I have a collective of friends around me that I'm inspired by.”\n-020 Interview\n\nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first established can potentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths which support individuals' sense of life satisfaction and overall wellbeing is hypothesized to set a state of mind conducive to positive Deliberate Rumination. \nThe set of character strengths associated with our Deliberate Rumination dimension is Judgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. These traits do intuitively make sense as critical factors for deliberate rumination and working together as a community to make difficult collective decisions about traveling, building and relationships. We hope that by bringing a greater awareness to these strengths of character people and programs will benefit from clearer thinking and more open discussion on what to do after difficulties arise. \nFreeze… or Laugh\nThe third  response individuals have in the face of an overwhelmingly negative situation is to freeze. In our interviews, we identify initial stages after the blast where many people felt stuck through expressing feelings of exasperation and frustration at the situation. Indicating they sense a loss of control. These aspects connect to Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) through negating the opposite, post traumatic stress. Some of the symptoms of PTS are freezing, feeling numbness, an inability to act or care, holding one’s breath, a sense of dread… \n\nWhile it’s important not to overstate the case of PTS, in fact, most people respond quite resiliently as proposed by (Bonanno, G. A. 2004), also in order for people to experience the positive effects of PTG even the challenges and stressors of ordinary life can be enough of a trigger to stimulate benefits (Ewert, A., & Tessneer, S. 2019). Before exploring people’s stress let’s explore the positive correlations between PTGI and Character Strengths:\n\nThe majority of the connection comes through the facet of PTGI-Appreciation. \n\n\n “...It's useless, they are not serving us by doing this. (Sharing news about the situation) They are producing anger that can't turn into anything. The people are already angry from the economic issue. They don't have proof. One can sit and do theories for hours.”\n017 Interview \n\n“Khalas(exasperated form of “enough” in Arabic). I can't control anything… I need to control my feelings thoughts rage. \n-020 Interview\n\nAfter a month, yeah. In the first month I was consuming a lot of news about it and then I decided to stop. I was just depressing myself and I couldn't do anything about it and I disconnected completely and living my life as if nothing was going on. [[Code: Response-Self Protection]] I wasn't in Beirut, It wasn't as traumatic I was in Sawfar\n006 Interview \n\n“I didn't force myself to deal, when I wanted to cry. I was crying, when I didn't feel willing to do anything I didn't do anything.”\n010 Interview\n\nRather than freezing in response, some of the interviewees exhibited avoidant behaviors, which parallel freezing:\n\n“After the blast I didn't go to Beirut until just now. It was too heartbreaking, I didn't want to see it. We were impacted from the protests and the views. I was in a state of denial I didn't want to believe that this has happened. I only went yesterday because I //HAD// to get a vaccine. In some buildings you see the effects of the blast, in other buildings it's been cleaned up.”\n010 Interview\n\nContrast the preceding statements with following statements which demonstrate interviewees engaging in highly motivated activities following the explosion:\n\n“When the blast happened, most businesses closed and people were cleaning up... When I was in gbeili - company, not antwork. I was looking at the employees and was thinking, don't you want to be in beirut helping other people? You could just go there and do something, this paperwork could be done another day.”\n019 Interview \n\n“I still have nightmares, I have PTSD. Do you really want to know what it's like? I had some calls with people from projectName. And suddenly the glass office I was in all collapsed and the couch I was sitting on was full of glass. Allah itlatuf (God intervened with mercy) it was a matter of minutes. I was caught up on my way down to the floor below with my manager having a silly discussion when the blast happened. And the whole lower floor was full of blood, everyone had to be taken to the hospital. We were so scared to move. Because there were two we expected a third. We all thought we were being blasted. Because of this we created a (product in response), it was a determination for us that (curseword) it we're staying. We're doing this for the country despite all the (curse) we're living through. It was created after the blast as a demonstration that we want to manufacture here, we want to create jobs, we want to build something for the kids that are deprived of toys, their childhood even.” https://roamresearch.com/#/app/EntrepreneurialResearch/page/ISYEjUAMD\n\nAggregating the pre-post tests from all the assessments we have before and after the blast, we found that by segmenting our assessments by individuals in the entrepreneurial training program, they have - on average - a one point increase in the measure of Humor in the VIA-IS inventory, over the course of the program. While Humor may be under-studied in academia, it correlates with the CS prepost variable in our dataset. \n “CS Prepost” is a measure of the overall change in Character Strength before and after the Beirut Port Explosion. In the following table, we observe that humor and creativity both are factors affecting the preservation of Character Strengths. We used JASP and a classical regression matrix since the variables are all continuous variables.  \n\nSo what is a theory behind humor and this buffering effect? Humor has been linked to adaptive coping and keeping a “light attitude” in the face of adversity (Ruch and Hofmann 2017). Humor is also an active response to take when other options are unavailable: people “break” the silence with laughter, for example. This may be preventing the processes which lead to Learned Helplessness. Learned helplessness is one way to view the opposite of post traumatic growth for people living in highly chaotic and destabilized situations. Initially Learned Helplessness theory implied that dogs experiencing inescapable shocks learned helplessness and persisted in helpless behavior even when the situation became escapable later. \n\nRecent research has shed light on the neurological underpinnings of learned helplessness which has application in uncertain times (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). Previously Learned Helplessness, as the name suggests, theorized that higher level mammals learn helpless behaviors when they are given inescapable negative experiences. Passivity in the face of a changed situation, a situation where it behooves the animal to take action, is the hallmark of learned helplessness. And while that behavior doesn’t change, our understanding of how it comes to be has. Mammals, when confronted with prolonged adverse situations, develop an unlearned response of passivity. It is possible to overcome this bias towards passivity by learning and exerting control. What behaviors are available to act on?\n\nOne additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory (Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive activities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities and capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with the neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of character strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost). Humor stands out as one of the only factors that is directly connected to growth and stands out as a unique lens to look at both PTG(PTGI) and Resilience(BRCS) as it ties them all together as can be seen in the following chart:  \nThe court jester is the only person able to speak the truth when there is a crippling fear gripping the court. Humor breaks the ice and we propose that it may also help sustain the neurological basis for control. Humor is one of the factors we are exploring in this paper along the dimension of growth, the other is self reflection and emotional reappraisal through Deliberate Rumination and the third is Engagement as manifested in anger/political action as well as social entrepreneurial ideation. \nHumor, Engagement & Deliberate Rumination\nDiscussion\n4.1 Implications and future directions\n4.2 Limitations \nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we investigated the Character Strength correlations with Resilience, Post Traumatic Growth and Deliberate Rumination. Since Character Strengths are correlated with Post Traumatic Growth and Wellbeing, and since there is a collection of applied interventions with scientific validity, we hope this analysis helps educators working inside and outside conflict. The idea of “pre-silience” (pre+resilience) applies here with the recommendations for actions being more helpful in situations before there is a traumatic event. \nLet’s review the frame and identify the correlated character strengths:\n\nHeading\n\nSDT\nMeasure -> Support\nCorrelated Character Strengths\nFight \nEngagement anger/political social entrepreneurial ideation. \n\nAutonomy\nResilience -> Engagement\nHope, Humor, Self-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. \nFlight\nDeliberate Rumination\nself reflection and emotional reappraisal\nRelatedness\nDeliberate Rumination -> Dialog\nJudgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. \nFreeze\nGrowth  Humor\nCompetency\nPTGI -> Growth\nAppreciation of Beauty, Fairness, Humor, Judgement, Leadership, Modesty/Humility, Perspective, Prudence, Social Intelligence, Spirituality and Teamwork\n\nThe strengths that correlate with motivation and wellbeing with the highest correlations are Teamwork, Social Intelligence and Judgement. \n\nThe total list of strengths which emerged from our analysis is:\n\t1\tAppreciation of Beauty\n\t2\tFairness\n\t3\tHope\n\t4\tHumor\n\t5\tJudgement \n\t6\tLeadership\n\t7\tModesty/Humility\n\t8\tPrudence\n\t9\tPerspective\n\t10\tSelf-Regulation\n\t11\tSocial Intelligence\n\t12\tSpirituality \n\t13\tTeamwork \n\nEveryone makes different decisions after a traumatic event, one size does not fit all in terms of how best to design a pedagogy for social entrepreneurs. We hope this paper inspires more exploration around increasing motivation and wellbeing before the traumatic event, generating “presilience” so that when challenges come the psychological and social support are already in place. \n\nOne thing is becoming more clear, it’s important to create spaces for truth speaking in the social entrepreneurship community, we must talk about our failures and fears as well as our successes. These spaces can be where people explore ways of being and inspire each other through positive open discussion around Character Strengths. These spaces could be a counter to the negativity bias seen on both social and traditional media. They offer a facilitated space to practice deliberate rumination with the positive guidance of facilitators. It also supports the spread of value-laden idioms, aphorisms, and other easily digestible ideas, which become heuristics for decision making. \n\nThe Character Strengths above come from a small sample study and the correlations do not imply causation. I hope this paper inspires others to take an applied approach to character strengths explorations and also publish their data openly to build up a stronger evidence base for Character Strengths interventions. \n\nI hope these findings make their way into communities of practice where social entrepreneurs can collectively support each other to create the next viable steady-state system wherever they are. \nI want to end with two insights, one from one of the participants of the study and one from a famous author:\n\n“...Values are the base of every human reaction and really, there's courage and motivation in every person that's hidden and this very sad event created or awakened values in people. Those of compassion and courage, of motivation of solidarity and nationalism. Inspire nationalism even as people as they leaving the country. The people that are leaving the country, they still say my dream is to come back one day to Lebanon. \nMaybe they will go and come back.”\n--Interview 017\n\n “If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” \n-Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\n\n\t•\tStrengths to develop. The character strengths that have a developmental trajectory; that is, they are least common in youth and need to increase over time through cognitive maturation are: appreciation of beauty & excellence, forgiveness, modesty, open-mindedness (Park & Peterson, 2006a; 2006b).\n\n\n\nIn (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve, C. L. 2011) the researchers described the nodes in the dynamical system of someone going through a traumatic experience as Core Beliefs. Previous research by Christopher Peterson has demonstrated that improvements in Character Strengths are correlated with improvements in the Post Traumatic Growth Index, for people that experience major life difficulties (Peterson 2008). And, importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their strengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018). \n\nThis inquiry eventually allowed us to identify factors which support social entrepreneurs along the three dimensions of responding to the blast: fighting, fleeing or freezing. We’ve mapped them to the Self Determination Theory (SDT) of Motivation (Deci & Ryan 2008) (Autonomy, Mastery and Relatedness). \n\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially described by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory has since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This model now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses to neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an individual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of responses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\n\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues that the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018). \n\nIn 2008 it was demonstrated that an overall growth in the Values In Action Character Strengths Inventory was correlated with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (Peterson et al. 2008). Traumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous section we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\n\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to the blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40 percent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation (WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion will be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports that the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the blast. One additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory (Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive activities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities and capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with the neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of character strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost).\nThe first sentence of the first paragraph should pick up some or most of the words from the title. You need to articulate the issue your paper addresses within the first three sentences to satisfy the expectations of your readers and maintain their attention. For the opening sentence of the introduction, be sure to avoid sweeping generalizations\nThe second paragraph of the introduction should provide a context and motivation for the current investigation. Typically, there are two reasons to write a paper: the study or ex- periment is the logical next step in a line of in- vestigation, or prior studies have been some- how deficient in some way that the current study addresses. You should decide which rationale best justifies your study. If it is the first reason, then the literature review should focus on the most important two to four articles (you can reference many more if you like), and show how this line of investigation has led to your study. If the reason is the inadequacy of previous studies, then the two to four most im- portant studies should be cited and their deficiencies explicitly stated. You will try to jus- tify your contentions by means of examples, proofs, or reasons, or by providing a narrative unfolding of the details or intricacies of the is- sue. As a rule, avoid referring to papers using author names (e.g., Anderson, Lee, and Wilson report in their 1967 study that...). Such strings of proper names tend to slow the pace of the writing and become altogether too cumbersome. Rather, state the point you want to make about the study and reference it with a number at the end of the sentence.\nThe third paragraph of the introduction should open with the explicit statement of the overarching reason your study is needed, drawing from the preceding paragraph. The last sentence of this paragraph should begin, “The purpose of this study was to...” Readers have a very strong and fixed expectation that the purpose of the study will be found in last sentence of the last paragraph of the introduc- tion.

In this context, our research examines the experiences of education-oriented social entrepreneurs in Lebanon, who faced significant challenges due to a currency devaluation, political instability, and a devastating explosion in Beirut.\n\nDeveloping educational experiences that promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) is critical to fostering an anti-fragile society. This study explores the factors contributing to the continued efforts of social entrepreneurs amidst these crises, highlighting the importance of humor, character strengths, and deliberate rumination.\n\nContext and Motivation\n\nThe 2020 Beirut Port Explosion, coupled with the global pandemic and economic collapse, brought acute stressors to Lebanon. Our research focuses on social entrepreneurs undergoing an entrepreneurship training program in Beirut, aiming to identify factors supporting their access to PTG. Through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative assessments, we analyze the resilience and character strengths that facilitate growth.\n\nPrior studies have shown the correlation between character strengths and PTG, but the unique context of Lebanon's multiple crises offers a novel perspective. This study addresses the need to understand how educational programs can nurture character strengths and promote deliberate rumination to support social entrepreneurs in crisis.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the factors promoting post-traumatic growth (PTG) to support educators working in crisis environments. By identifying character strengths and deliberate rumination as critical components, we aim to offer insights that can inform the development of anti-fragile educational programs for social entrepreneurs.\n\n17:44\nBilal Ghalib Research Project.pdf\nPDF\nACSI End of Program Review.pdf\nPDF\nBilal Literature Review.pdf\nPDF\nBilal Ghalib Preliminary TOC and Data.pdf\nPDF\nLet's derive some insights from the documents to improve my paper. What new concepts or new, unique insights that you think I can contribute to the academic literature can you find in these documents?\n17:44\nChatGPT\nAfter analyzing the provided documents, several new concepts and unique insights can be derived that could contribute to the academic literature on resilience, post-traumatic growth, and social entrepreneurship, especially in conflict zones. Here are some potential contributions:\n\n1. The Role of Humor in Post-Traumatic Growth\nInsight: The research identifies humor as a significant character strength that supports post-traumatic growth (PTG). Humor helps in preventing feelings of helplessness and fosters a positive environment that can promote resilience and innovation among social entrepreneurs.\n\nContribution: Investigating the specific mechanisms through which humor contributes to PTG and resilience in conflict zones could add valuable insights. This might include how humor moderates stress responses and encourages adaptive coping strategies among entrepreneurs.\n\n2. Deliberate Rumination and Narrative Reconstruction\nInsight: The documents highlight the importance of deliberate rumination, which involves reflective thinking about one’s life circumstances, as a factor that supports PTG. This contrasts with intrusive rumination, which is often detrimental.\n\nContribution: Exploring the role of deliberate rumination in narrative reconstruction after traumatic events could provide new understanding into how entrepreneurs rebuild their personal and professional lives. This could include developing interventions that facilitate deliberate rumination to promote resilience and entrepreneurial intent.\n\n3. The Impact of Social Support on Entrepreneurial Resilience\nInsight: Social support is repeatedly mentioned as a critical factor for resilience and PTG among social entrepreneurs. The presence of supportive networks can buffer the negative impacts of trauma and foster a sense of community and shared purpose.\n\nContribution: Examining the specific types and sources of social support that are most effective in conflict zones can offer practical guidelines for creating support systems for entrepreneurs. This could also involve studying the interplay between social support, resilience, and entrepreneurial success.\n\n4. Spirituality and Resilience\nInsight: The documents discuss spirituality as a double-edged sword. While spirituality can contribute positively to PTG through spiritual enhancement, there is a risk of spiritual bypassing, where individuals use spiritual ideas to avoid dealing with unresolved emotional issues.\n\nContribution: A nuanced investigation into how spirituality interacts with resilience and entrepreneurial outcomes could provide a balanced view. This might involve identifying practices that support genuine spiritual growth and resilience without leading to avoidance behaviors.\n\n5. Polyvagal Theory in Entrepreneurial Contexts\nInsight: The research uses Polyvagal Theory to frame responses to traumatic events, categorizing them as fight, flight, or freeze. This model helps in understanding the varied responses of entrepreneurs to stress and trauma.\n\nContribution: Applying Polyvagal Theory to entrepreneurial behavior in conflict zones could be a novel contribution. This could include studying how different stress responses affect entrepreneurial decision-making, innovation, and long-term business sustainability.\n\n6. Character Strengths Development through Entrepreneurial Programs\nInsight: Character strengths such as hope, humor, self-regulation, social intelligence, and teamwork are highlighted as crucial for resilience and PTG. The Bloom program’s buffering effect on participants' character strengths compared to non-participants is particularly noteworthy.\n\nContribution: Developing and validating character strengths interventions tailored for entrepreneurs in conflict zones could provide a valuable toolkit for educators and policymakers. This could include longitudinal studies to track the effectiveness of these interventions over time.\n\n7. Migration Ideation among Social Entrepreneurs\nInsight: The documents reveal complex decision-making processes regarding migration among social entrepreneurs, influenced by safety, economic stability, and a sense of duty towards their community.\n\nContribution: A detailed study on migration ideation among social entrepreneurs in conflict zones could offer insights into the factors that retain or repel entrepreneurial talent. This could help in designing policies and programs that address the root causes of migration and support local entrepreneurial ecosystems.\n\nBy integrating these insights into your paper, you can offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted exploration of the factors supporting resilience and post-traumatic growth in social entrepreneurs, particularly in conflict zones. These contributions could provide valuable theoretical and practical implications for future research and policy development.\n\n17:53\nGiven the type of research, and the size of the number of participants, and the limitations, list all the limitations, and then list all of the unique star-selling points of this research.\n17:53\nChatGPT\nLimitations of the Research\nSmall Sample Size: The research is based on a relatively small number of participants (21 social entrepreneurs), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to a larger population.\n\nGeographic and Contextual Specificity: The study is focused on social entrepreneurs in Lebanon, particularly in the context of the 2020 Beirut Port Explosion and the accompanying economic and political crises. This specific context may limit the applicability of the findings to other regions or types of crises.\n\nTemporal Limitations: The post-test assessments were conducted over a three-month period, which may not capture long-term changes in character strengths and post-traumatic growth. The timing of the assessments might also affect the results due to varying degrees of trauma processing among participants.\n\nSelf-Reported Data: Much of the data relies on self-reported measures, which can be subject to biases such as social desirability bias, recall bias, and demand characteristics.\n\nLack of Control Group: While the study compares participants inside and outside the Bloom program, it lacks a true control group that did not experience any intervention, making it difficult to attribute changes solely to the program.\n\nQualitative Data Challenges: Qualitative interviews are subject to interpretative biases, and the coding process for qualitative data can introduce subjective elements that affect the consistency and reliability of the findings.\n\nUnforeseen Variables: The inductive approach to identifying variables means that some relevant factors may have been missed or inadequately explored, particularly those not initially considered.\n\nCultural Specificity: The cultural context of Lebanon, including its unique socio-political environment and religious landscape, may influence the findings in ways that are not easily transferable to other contexts.\n\nUnique Selling Points of the Research\nContextual Relevance: The study provides valuable insights into the experiences of social entrepreneurs in a highly volatile and crisis-ridden environment, offering practical implications for similar contexts globally.\n\nFocus on Post-Traumatic Growth: By examining PTG rather than just resilience or recovery, the research adds a positive dimension to the understanding of how individuals and communities can thrive after traumatic events.\n\nHolistic Approach: The integration of qualitative and quantitative methods provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing PTG and resilience, combining depth with breadth in the data analysis.\n\nInnovative Use of Character Strengths: The research highlights the role of specific character strengths, such as humor, in promoting PTG. This focus on strengths offers a constructive framework for developing interventions.\n\nApplication of Polyvagal Theory: The use of Polyvagal Theory to frame responses to trauma (fight, flight, freeze) is innovative in the context of social entrepreneurship and offers a new lens for understanding entrepreneurial behavior in crises.\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship Focus: The study’s focus on social entrepreneurs is unique, recognizing their potential as agents of change and stability in crisis contexts. This perspective underscores the importance of supporting social entrepreneurship in policy and practice.\n\nPractical Implications for Education and Training: The findings provide actionable insights for designing educational and training programs that promote resilience and PTG, with specific recommendations for incorporating humor and deliberate rumination.\n\nRich Qualitative Data: The in-depth interviews provide rich, contextualized insights into the lived experiences of participants, offering valuable narratives that can inform both theory and practice.\n\nMixed Communities of Practice: The research suggests the value of creating mixed communities where diverse spiritual, religious, and therapeutic ideas are shared, potentially enhancing collective resilience and growth.\n\nImpact on Migration Ideation: By exploring the complex decision-making processes around migration among social entrepreneurs, the study provides unique insights into factors that influence entrepreneurial commitment to their communities during crises.\n\nSupport for Policy Development: The findings can inform policies aimed at fostering social entrepreneurship, resilience, and PTG in conflict zones and crisis-affected areas, contributing to broader societal stability and recovery efforts.\n\nBy acknowledging the limitations and emphasizing these unique selling points, the research can position itself as a valuable contribution to the fields of resilience, PTG, and social entrepreneurship, particularly in volatile and crisis-prone environments.\n\n17:53\nWhat do you think would be the two most valuable, most academically viable and legitimate papers I could write that would have a strong impact on contributing to post-traumatic growth research?

In Lebanon, the\naddition of an economic collapse and a major explosion in the capital city brought acute\nstressors, triggering migration ideation. This research analyzes motivation for migration and\nsocial entrepreneurial ideation as well overall wellbeing for social entrepreneurs.\nPurpose: In this study, we aim to extrapolate the factors that support social entrepreneurs\nwellbeing and motivation by analyzing the relationship between resilience, posttraumatic growth\n(PTG), and character strengths within a training program in Beirut.\nMethodology: After gathering a broad set of data (pre-post assessments of Character Strengths,\nPost Traumatic Growth Inventory, Rumination, Entrepreneurial Intent, Resilience, Impact of\nEvent - Revised) we conducted a qualitative analysis to assess and tag responses. Correlations\nwere identified with factors that support post traumatic growth, resilience and social\nentrepreneurial ideation.\nFindings/Conclusions: While each person’s life journey is unique, we have identified that social\nentrepreneurship ideation is promoted by prior traumatic experiences, followed by opportunities\nand support for growth. Traumatic experiences are inescapable in life, and the opportunity\neducators and trainers have is to understand how to shift the trauma response curve towards\ngrowth. Deliberate Rumination, thinking and reflecting about one’s life circumstances can be\nincorporated into group facilitations. Character Strengths are correlated with PTG and there are\nvalidated methods for reliably developing strengths of character. One highly leverable strength is\nhumor, and one way humor can support growth is by preventing helplessness.\nImplications: The results of this study increases an understanding of the complex decision\nmaking individuals face in a crisis, and offers insights into the factors which support\nposttraumatic growth and contributing to society through social entrepreneurship. We hope the\n3\n\nresults of this paper inspire facilitators to incorporate humor, positive structured conversation and\nto enliven their program with character development.\nIntroduction\nHomo Sapiens and Neanderthals coexisted for thousands of years. Both species were tool users,\nsophisticated in their socialization, and both made seafaring vessels. Yet, there is one crucial\ndifference : although Neanderthals had the physical technology to cross the seas and spread to\nnew lands, only Homo Sapiens did. It appears that Homo Sapiens are successful as a species in\npart due to our appetite for risk, our ability to sail out into the endless sea with hope for a further,\nmore profitable shore (Stringer 2012, see figure 1). It might be that our presence on every\ncontinent on Earth is a testimony to our entrepreneurial instinct.\nOn the other hand, in the mathematical field of dynamical systems theory, the concept of an\nattractor is the set of states that draws a system together. Societies and people tend to stay in their\nsteady states until an extreme situation is thrust upon them, creating an opportunity for creating a\nnew steady-state system. In (Triplett, K. N., Tedeschi, R. G., Cann, A., Calhoun, L. G., & Reeve,\nC. L. 2011) the researchers described the nodes in the dynamical system of someone going\nthrough a traumatic experience as Core Beliefs.\nThis research paper reviews 21 social entrepreneurs working in Lebanon precisely throughout\nsuch a destabilizing event. Over the year 2020, Lebanese entrepreneurs experienced a failed\npopular uprising, the spread of the coronavirus, a currency devaluation, and the Beirut Port\nExplosion, which killed over 200 people and injured thousands of others while leaving 300,000\npeople homeless.\nConducting qualitative and quantitative research to explore the impact of the explosion and\npotential for Post Traumatic Growth alongside other factors, this research paper attempts to\nanalyse the decision making at an inflection point for social entrepreneurs.\nIn an attempt to create scalable impact from limited dollars, iNGOs (international Non Profit\n4\n\nOrganizations) are increasingly looking to support social businesses. Market prices track\ninternational events such as wars and famine to extreme weather events, and thus we can make\nan assumption about the general volatility of the world at large by reviewing the CBOE Volatility\nand the CBOE Volatility of Volatility indexes (see figure 2). Judging from the fact that 2020\nexperienced the highest rate of volatility in March after the beginning of the coronavirus\npandemic it is evident how market volatility can map to indirect market forces, chaos in the\nworld. The VOV index shows a slight, yet clear trendline - the world is becoming more volatile.\nThe US Army War College defined the concept of VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex,\nAmbiguous) during the cold war (UNHCR 2021), and recently announced a new peak in the\nnumber of international refugees, increasing the interconnection of people adding to the\ncomplexity and destabilizing societies. We find trends indicating increased political polarization,\nclimate change, increasing pandemics and financial instability, and in the face of the lack of\ntrusted political systems social entrepreneurship is seen as a counterbalancing force, especially\nwhere there already are systemic challenges, like Lebanon. To systematically address the many\nglobal challenges, recently framed by the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), many\nmultinational NGOs and international development organizations are establishing funds and\noffering support for social entrepreneurial activities. The vision is to create a triple bottom line\nbetween people, the planet, and profits through social entrepreneurship.\nThe question underpinning the research on a pool of 21 social entrepreneurs (with half in an\nentrepreneurial program and half outside of it) centers on the question: how do we nurture and\nmotivate social entrepreneurs in a values oriented program? We attempt to answer this question\nby understanding the impact of the traumatic event (IES-R) for “fight”, their deliberate and\nintrusive rumination amongst social entrepreneurs in Lebanon for “flight” and their potential\nresulting growth (PTGI) for “freeze”. We will describe the reasoning for the mapping shortly.\nPrevious research by Christopher Peterson has demonstrated that improvements in Character\nStrengths are correlated with improvements in the Post Traumatic Growth Index, for people that\n5\n\nexperience major life difficulties (Peterson 2008). And, importantly, there’s a growing body of\nevidence that there are character strength interventions that support people in developing their\nstrengths (Schutte, N. S., & Malouff, J. M. 2018).\nThis inquiry eventually allowed us to identify factors which support social entrepreneurs along\nthe three dimensions of responding to the blast: fighting, fleeing or freezing. We’ve mapped\nthem to the Self Determination Theory (SDT) of Motivation (Deci & Ryan 2008) (Autonomy,\nMastery and Relatedness). This helps us create a map of understanding about how a traumatic\nevent might influence the motivation of entrepreneurs (SDT), and will give us measures to\nunderstand how to measure change on the relevant variables. Additionally, it gives us tools to\nsupport entrepreneurs in a deeper understanding of themselves and their situations, as well as\ntools to help develop the strengths of character that they value - and which will hopefully help\nthem find flushing in life, no matter the external situations and no matter how they choose to\nrespond to the crisis.\nHeading SDT Measures / Questions Support For\nFighting Autonomy Resilience and social / revolutionary ideation.\nWho gets out on the streets/commits to their\nsocial business?\nEngagement\nFlight Relatedness Deliberate Rumination. How does how we talk\nabout the situation affect growth and how does\ngrowth affect thoughts about leaving?\nDialog\nFreeze Competency PTGI and Character strengths. How can we use\nhumor to help break the ice?\nPost\nTraumatic\nGrowth\nA subset of character strengths correlate to the above measures and can be interesting areas\nfor further interventional research.\n6\n\nInterestingly, there is only one factor in our study that correlates with social entrepreneurial\nideation, and that is if they have experienced a prior traumatic experience and were able to\ndescribe it articulately during the interview. It seems that trauma can open a door to increase\ncompassion, reject the traditional narrative of fitting into the economy with a “real job”, and help\npeople in connecting with a higher purpose. With this as our starting point, we explore the\nfactors that support people in developing the self awareness and strength of character to grow\nafter a traumatic experience.\nTable of Contents\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nTable of Contents\nMethodology\nQualitative Analysis:\nQuantitative Data:\nChallenges:\nData Analysis and Insights:\nFlight\nFreeze… or Laugh\nConclusion\nFigures:\nCitations:\n7\n\nMethodology\nWe’ve used a qualitative analysis method for the exploration of our research, in an attempt to\nidentify potentially unseen variables. These unseen variables support the exploration of those\nfactors that contribute to, or detract from commitment, to social entrepreneurship. The author of\nthis paper has been able to utilize their position as the head of Research And Development at\nBloom, an organization which operates social enterprise acceleration and education programs.\nPrior to the Beirut Port Explosion in August 2020, the participants and applicants for the Bloom\nsocial entrepreneurship accelerator program had already taken the Values In Action Character\nStrengths Inventory (VIA-IS). At the conclusion of the four months long accelerator, and\nfollowing the Beirut Explosion, the applicants who were not selected as well as the participants\nwho were a part of the program requested to complete a post-test VIA-IS inventory. An analysis\nof the pre/post test data for the VIA-IS demonstrated a buffering effect experienced by\nindividuals who were a part of the Bloom program, which led to in-program individuals\nmaintaining their overall VIA average while individuals outside the program experienced a\nsignificant drop. To understand this phenomenon was the genesis of this research, and inspired\nthe qualitative/quantitative research methodology described below.\nQualitative Analysis:\nThe qualitative analysis consisted of twenty one 1.5 hour long interviews, which were all\nconducted remotely and recorded digitally. The interviewees were split with 10 people coming\nfrom outside the training program and 11 people who had gone through the training program\n(marked as “In prog.”). The questions for the interview were segmented into the following\nthemes:\nTopic Key Insight Explored\nIntroduction and Background Work habits and family entrepreneurial background\nEthnographic Questions What is their educational/ family's income level?\n8\n\nEntrepreneurial Intent (EI) What is their level of commitment to entrepreneurship?\nImpact of Event Scale (IES-R) What was the level of impact of the Beirut Explosion?\nResilience (BRCS) What is their level of resilience?\nPost Traumatic Growth Index\n(PTGI)\nHow much did people grow after the Beirut Explosion?\nRumination Scales What is the ratio of deliberate and intrusive rumination?\nConcluding Statements What does entrepreneurship mean in places facing\ninstability?\nThe interview consisted of open ended questions as well as questions requesting a qualitative\nresponse. Both questions were answered live on the call, allowing the interviewee to offer deeper\ncontext into the numerical responses. The audio for the interviews were transcribed manually,\nand an inductive process was followed to derive codes. The interview corpus was then brought\ninto a software supporting bi-directional links through which code clusters were identified.\nQuantitative Data:\nDuring the semi-structured interview process, alongside the open-ended questions, the\ninterviewer also gathered quantitative answers for the following measures:\n1. Post Traumatic Growth Index (PTGI Tedeschi & Calhoun 1996)\n2. The Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS Sinclair and Wallson 2004)\n3. The Impact of Event Scale: Revised (IES-R DS Weiss 2007)\n4. The Intrusive - Event Related Rumination Inventory (EERI Cann et al., 2011)\n5. Entrepreneurial Intention (EI) scale derived from Luthje & Frank (2003); Duijn (2009) /\nKrueger et al. (2000)\n6. The VIA Inventory referenced above. Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P. (2004)\n9\n\nA subset of the codes derived from the interview corpus were identified as meaningful\nsegmentation markers, and each interview was then tagged in the database for analysis with the\nobserved value.\nSegmentation Tags:\nProperty Fields Description\nHas_Therepist True/False/Unsure Does the individual attend therapy?\nInjury_From_Blast True/False/Unsure Was the interviewee injured in the\nBeirut Port Explosion?\nEntrepreneurial_Family True/False/Unsure Does the interviewee come from an\nentrepreneurial family?\nPlacebuilding_Ideation True/False/Unsure Is the interviewee committed to\nusing their working life to\ncontribute to society?\nMigration_Ideation True/False/Unsure Is the interviewee considering\nmigrating out of Lebanon?\nRevolutionary_Ideation True/False/Unsure Does the interviewee politically\nactive, engage in protests, view\ntheir work as activism?\nIncome_Simplified Lower/Middle/Upper How does the participant view their\nfamilies income bracket?\nMeditation True/False/Unsure Does the participant have an active\nmeditation practice?\n10\n\nThe reasoning behind having a qualitative and quantitative approach was to be able to identify\nunforeseen variables through the interviews, while simultaneously having validated measures for\nimportant features like the Impact of The Event Scale (IES-R). This allows us to have a\nqualitative comparison point with which to compare interviews and derive insights.\nChallenges:\nFollowing an inductive tagging methodology, in which novel categories were derived from\ninterviews, led to a challenge in which not all participants were asked relevant questions. For\nexample, it became clear that prior experience with violence - such as living through the 2006\nwar - may have potential relevance on the responses people had to the current time of tumult.\nThis observation led some of the data in our table to be segmented to three categories: True,\nFalse and Unsure.\nAnother challenge came up in regards to perceived social expectations of the interviewer during\nthe interview, sometimes referred to as Demand Characteristics, a theory expounded on by Orne,\nMartin T. (2009). Some participants qualified their responses with statements like: “I only put a\nfour because I didn’t experience it directly myself.” This happened on repeated occasions with\nindividuals who seemed to be embarrassed by the fact that they were feeling high levels of\nnegative impact from the effects of the Beirut Port Explosion, without actually witnessing it\ndirectly, being injured or knowing people who have been injured or killed.\nThe process of going wide with the qualitative interview and going deep with the quantitative\nmeasures has exposed variables and areas of study that would not have been obvious at the start\nof the research process. To add a final note, the VIA-IS assessment was done as an online\nquestionnaire outside the interview structure allowing us to compare pre-post tests, and with the\nentire set of VIA Inventories conducted with 260+ entrepreneurs.\n11\n\nData Analysis and Insights:\nOverview of Data and Background Knowledge\nAfter a threatening situation, animals and humans respond in a variety of ways. Initially\ndescribed by Walter Cannon (Cannon, W. B. 1915) as the Fight or Flight response, the theory\nhas since then been adapted by Dr. Stephen Porges into Polyvagal theory (Porges 2009). This\nmodel now includes freezing as an alternative response, and attempts to correlate stress responses\nto neurohormonal responses. In the face of a situation in which no options seem viable, an\nindividual can either choose to fight, flee (flight) or freeze. We will be using these three types of\nresponses as a framing for potential ways our interviewees responded to the Beirut Blast.\nIn 2011, Martin Seligman (Seligman 2011) made the hypothesis that PERMA (Positive Emotion,\nEngagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) comprises well-being, and argues\nthat the model is helpful for measurement as well as for application (Seligman 2018).\nBefore we get into the analysis of the data, please review the prior description of the data and\ndata gathering phase. If you would like to explore the data yourself, you can find a public dataset\navailable to review here: http://bit.ly/cs-data-21\nThe Character Strengths data was gathered as part of the application process for a social\nentrepreneurship program before the August 4th, 2020 explosion. After the explosion, to\nunderstand deeper changes in entrepreneurial ideation we conducted a second VIA-IS as well as\na new questionnaire using the new measures described above. To start the exploration as to the\nfactors which support social entrepreneurs we keep in mind the question: who grows as a social\nentrepreneur in times of adversity and who reprioritizes the notion of their career trajectory to\nfocus more on self preservation. In 2008 Christopher Peterson (Peterson et al. 2008)\ndemonstrated a positive correlation between the VIA-IS Character Strengths Inventory and the\nPost-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). The PTGI measures\ngrowth on the dimensions of Appreciation, New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Spiritual\n12\n\nEnhancement and Personal Strength; interestingly, all of these dimensions are relevant for social\nentrepreneurial ideation. Comparing PTGI with the Character Strengths assessment we identify\nthat Humor, Teamwork, Spirituality, Prudence and Judgement have a significant correlation for\nPTGI across the five sub-dimensions, see figures below.\nData validity questions.\nWe initially hypothesized that there would be a correlation between CS prepost (Character\nStrengths Difference in average scores assessed before/after the blast) and Post Traumatic\nGrowth. While there seems to be a slight correlation between CS prepost and PTGI -\nAppreciation (.33 p-val .14) we cannot at this time with our limited data make any strong\nstatements about Character Strength changes before/after an explosion and PTGI. One factor\ncould be that the time frame for the post test was taken over a 3 month period (December -\nMarch 2020) and it might be interesting to study a progression of changes rather than comparing\npre and post. Growth takes time and measuring over an extended period confuses the data. Also,\nassessing people earlier, and therefore closer to the period of the traumatic event may not have\nleft time to metabolize the experience while people who filled in the assessment later have had\nmore opportunities. Another bias that may be influencing the data is potentially the types of\npeople who submit forms early compared to those who wait may also capture proactive people\nearly in the recovery process and procrastinators later in their process. Rather than adding\nanother factor to control for procrastination, I propose future assessments to include deadlines for\ninclusion into the dataset, or to include time of receipt as an influencing factor.\nAnd now, we begin to explore motivation and wellbeing for entrepreneurs following the Fight,\nFlight and Freeze framework.\nFight\nAfter the Beirut Explosion, many of the interviewees were feeling anger. Although anger may be seen as a\nnegative state, we found that many of the participants used their anger towards a factor we called\n13\n\nRevolutionary Ideation, clicking this link will take you to see sections of the interview tagged with this\nconcept.\n“Angry at the government, of course. Angry that the city I love was destroyed. The nice things\nabout our city were destroyed in a second because of the irresponsibility of the people governing.\nOf course I went to the protest that happened immediately after” - Interview 006\nSome people went to the streets to protest, while others viewed their entrepreneurial activity as\ntheir “action” in response:\n“With the revolution came many different revolutions... one of the revolutions we're making is in\neducation. And I say that I'm an activist and not on the ground - it's our revolution in education.\nI don't think the revolution is only about going down and doing it violently. It's about rethinking,\nunlearning, recreating. Putting aside everything traditional / forced upon us / trying to make a\ndifference. not just to make money. Money is not the aim, it's the reward. It's not the reward I'm\naiming for. The impact is the aim I want. There's lots, revolutions in media, education, revolution\nin feminism/sexuality. This awareness is coming out and has been a social revolution not only\n(taboo). Not just a gov /political revolution, it's everything. This is my revolution.”\n-Interview 019\n14\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, the majority of participants with revolutionary ideation\ncame from people who were not intending to leave Lebanon, even after the blast. While\nrevolutionary thinking and political engagement is not the primary focus of this paper, it is worth\nbeing included here since many of the inspiration for social entrepreneurs comes from areas the\npublic sector is lacking in, and can be seen as a form of direct action. Most of the social\nentrepreneurs interviewed for this paper were operating businesses solving problems in the\ndomain of education.\nAnother important reason to consider the idea of “Fighting” and using the feeling of Anger is\nthat it is a fact bound to happen, especially when paired with major traumatic events. So rather\nthan avoiding the feeling, we can sublimate anger to increase the critical factor of engagement to\nprevent freezing, complacency, and inaction. While the language of fighting is not necessarily\npositive, it does imply a high degree of activation and purpose, something important to maintain\nin the face of conflict and insurmountable odds.\n15\n\nThe measure we’ve selected for “Fight” is resilience, labeled BRCS (Sinclair and Walston\n2004), it measures the following questions on a 5 point scale:\n1. I look for creative ways to alter difficult situations.\n2. Regardless of what happens to me, I believe I can control my reaction to it.\n3. I believe I can grow in positive ways by dealing with difficult situations.\n4. I actively look for ways to replace the losses I encounter in life.\nActing as an antidote to the potential freezing reflex, resilience inspires action and engagement.\nWhile focusing on character strengths development has been shown to support wellbeing factors\ndescribed by PERMA (Goodman & Kauffman 2017), there appears to be a subset that stands out\nin our set of interviews. The components of this subset are the following : Hope, Humor,\nSelf-Regulation, Social-Intelligence and Teamwork. We can see that these are especially\ncorrelated with resilience, and may be interesting to explore as in future studies.\nWhat might not support direct engagement? The following table presents negative correlations\nbetween Revolutionary Ideation that we can find identified in the data, there are no strong\npositive correlations to present.\n16\n\nThe relationships that stand out to me are the relationship between Prudence, having a child and\nRevolutionary Ideation. Prudent parents are less likely to be engaged in protests and other types\nof activism. Another strong correlation is with Spirituality. Diving into how one mother\nresponded to the explosion we can see both features at play:\n“No, nothing changed. God's will will still happen as it should. Nothing has changed. I worked\nas a mother to prevent the impact from impacting my children much so they don't stay home\nalone. I didn't have much capacity to go to the site to volunteer. Fadi my brother was there and\nsaw the fire that became the blast and was more present. I personally focused on making sure\nmy children would cross this situation without harm. Fadi worked on support.”\n-013 Interview Spirituality rank 7/24 & Has_Child True\nWhile the strength of Spirituality contributes positively to Post Traumatic Growth through the\n“Spiritual Enhancement” facet, there is a concern that over-focusing on the strength of\nspirituality could lead to spiritual bypassing, which is a coping strategy where people use\nspiritual ideas to avoid facing unresolved emotional issues and development tasks. Spiritual\n17\n\nbypassing was coined by John Welwood and developed in (Cashwell, C. S., Glosoff, H. L., &\nHammond, C. 2010).\nInterviewee number 18 expressed the balance between trusting in the “Will of God” and\ndeveloping and engaging in acts of control like this:\n“We do have control over that, if it's going to happen it's going to happen. If maybe we knew\nabout it, maybe it's going to happen anyway. We're destined to have this. There's a saying in the\n(The Islamic Spiritual Tradition), aqqqalal (Arabic for use your brain/do something rational)\nwatawakal (Arabic for rely on God) - before submitting (to the will of God) do what you have to\ndo. DO what we should do and at the end of the day what's going to happen is going to\nhappen.”\n-018 Interview\nFigure 6 in the figures section below displays an interesting chart exposing some relationships\nbetween meditation, spirituality, revolutionary / social ideation. Spirituality is correlated with not\nhaving a therapist perhaps indicating that people with a stronger spiritual practice don’t identify\nwith the need to find a therapist. This is interesting because it seems that having a therapist\ncorrelates with deliberate rumination and meditation. Reviewing age seems to indicate that the\nyounger generations are more open to therapy and meditation alongside their religious and\nspiritual beliefs.\nOne takeaway from the above analysis is that creating mixed communities of practice where\nvarious spiritual, religious, therapeutic ideas are shared openly might create an opportunity for\nalternative perspectives to be displayed and their results seen, either amplifying or dampening\nthe ideas that the group selects as valuable. This might be an important task for course designers\nand facilitators to navigate carefully. 013 expressed a value in action by nurturing their child,\nwhile 019 demonstrated Bravery and a rallying cry to contribute socially in a time of\nrevolutionary change. In relation to the theme of this section, both of them are putting up a good\nfight and are engaged in a values informed course of action.\n18\n\nFlight\nTraumatic events are destabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image\nand worldviews, and while possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change and\npositive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and support (Roepke, A.\nM., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014) how people choose to respond is highly variable. In the previous\nsection we described people who engage (flight), this time, let’s discuss migration (flight).\nFlight is an inevitable response that many people have when something tragic happens. Prior to\nthe blast, Lebanon had a migration challenge where the World Bank data indicates that about 40\npercent of male and 30 percent of female university graduates leave Lebanon upon graduation\n(WorldBank 2014). While it is still too early to tell what the migration impact of the explosion\nwill be, the total population of Lebanon has dropped .44% last year and (Ibrahim 2020) reports\nthat the number of people leaving Lebanon increased by about 30% in the first month after the\nblast. Understanding the decision making process of social entrepreneurs is critical since they are\nan important part of the population working on creating stability and creating positive reasons for\npeople to stay, either through their services, as employees or customers.\nThis snippet of dialog from an interview demonstrates in real time holding multiple perspectives\nand ends with a contradiction, to desire to want to stay.\n“For instance if I had kids. If I was in Beirut/ lost a close family member I may have thought I\nwould leave. Fortunately for me I don't’, it’s related to how much they can take. My brother is\nleaving for France in September, I can't leave everyone/my family. We have the family business,\nmy father is relatively old. And I want to stay here willingly.”\n-004 Interview\nThe research strategy was initially going to divide the population into “those who stay and build”\nand “those who leave and protect themselves and their families” - during the coding process we\n19\n\nfound that the decision is emotional some people want to leave and contribute, and some want to\nstay and contribute, and many others have competing commitments that are unclear. Sometimes\nthe interviewee demonstrates deep self knowledge and desires to leave for strategic reasons, to\ncontinue to be able to offer their work life as a service to their community they need to stay safe,\nsane and alive:\n“I won't lie, sometimes I feel like leaving too. Why do I think about it? To keep this\nengine/enthusiasm/giving to people I have to feel secure. Not that I will die at any instant. So\nmuch is online so I can do so much of my work online. I can be effective even if I’m not\nphysically in the country. I think of my safety, my family… and my earnings. Now I’m fine.\nAfter a while will I still be fine? I’m investing from my income, will I still be able to invest in\nmy team? That’s the one thing I’m thinking about. I’m investing in the base, raising this “child”\nso that one day the company will come and pay me back and take care of me when I’m older.\nThank goodness God has given me a salary. I see tangible results. We’re going to print the book\nand sell it and make money from it. I can see it all. It's not like we’re playing and not doing\nanything.\n-002 Interview\nThis powerful snippet from the interview shows the strategic process 002 has taken to rationalize\nher potential departure from Lebanon. Some questions arise as to how much the combination of\nthe massive spread of the coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown supports people in their\nmigration ideation. It could be that as people have spent much of 2020 indoors people now, like\n002, have taken their social entrepreneurship programs online and have less of a physical\ninvestment in their physical environments.\nOther interviewees have a clearer commitment to leaving and do not seem conflicted in any way:\n“I live with my mom/brother. And we are all affected by the situation of course. Because before\nthat - the port - we already had the economic situation and we were feeling safe since a long time\nnothing happened security wise. we heard it could happen again. We don't feel safe anymore.\n20\n\nI don't have foreign nationality, so I decided not to take a French one. It's complicated to find a\njob, it's a safe thing to do to have a possibility if one has to go outside Lebanon. I would be\ninterested in leaving if I had an opportunity. Someone said for Canada. Someone said it's very far\nand they don't take Lebanese for my age. For security reasons I could go to France for example.\nIt's a sure avenue, I need a challenge in my life. I don't like routine.”\n-Interview 017\n“Participants who maintain calm and develop adaptive self-regulating practices Actually my\nthinking is everyone is thinking about leaving. Something inside me that doesn't want to leave\ndespite everything. I don't know why I'm still calm. I see the craziness all around us. The best\nthing you can do is focus with what you have, and how you can help others with what you have.\nIf you focus on all the bad things around us you can't work. What I decided is to help and doing\nwhat I can do and keeping my mental health and family health and that's how to survive\neverything. Of course we felt very bad and it was very stressful for us and all these feelings. I\njust wanted to stay calm.”\n-014 Interview\nAlbert Bandura’s Social Cognition Theory (Bandura 1989) proposes that a portion of knowledge\nacquisition comes from social evaluation, from our data we see that people modulate their\nmigration ideation based on many factors, one of which is how and who they speak to about it.\nTraumatic events disrupt the standard narrative model needing new stories to support meaning,\nsuggests Neimeyer in (Neimeyer, R. A. (2004), how are those narratives reconstructed? In a\npaper developing a model of Post Traumatic Growth for cancer patients (Morris, B. A., &\nShakespeare-Finch, J. 2011) identified Deliberate Rumination as a strong influencing factor for\nPTG. Further research demonstrated the relationship between PTG and life satisfaction through\nthe factor of meaning:\n21\n\nIn the paper (Triplett et al. - 2012), they demonstrated that the disruption of core beliefs (CBIs)\ntriggers both intrusive and deliberate rumination and that the destabilizing aspects of a traumatic\nevent either supports a more meaningful life of satisfaction through deliberately contemplating\nthe experience, or can negatively affect meaning and life satisfaction through intrusive\nrumination.\nDeliberate Rumination is the process of choosing the questions and thoughts one has around a\ntraumatic event, for instance “what is the lesson I am learning through this” in contrast with\nIntrusive Rumination and Brooding which may take the tone of “why is this always happening to\nme”. We can see both examples in our interview data set. Observe as 018 reflects on discussions\nhad during a group dialog with other social entrepreneurs in the entrepreneurial training\nprogram:\n“...First I was thinking if we stay in this country, I can do anything in this country. Nothing\nlimiting me, why would I leave this country.... Why ... maybe I should have a backup country if\nsomething unexpected happens. Just having this backup country in mind can help me (with my\nproject). … Then(the start of the program) (projectName) (personName) starting asking which\ncountry do you want to go to? And I started thinking, first that ... I have friends, good nature,\nwhy leave? Then after the blast I have a different perspective of the country and started thinking\nof where I can go when/if something unexpected happens.”\n22\n\n--018 Interview\nOther examples of social cognition supporting someone positively through social media and\ndescribing the importance of having a community of positive social support to help create a\nsense of control and meaning as he adjusts his worldview through the development of spiritual\nand meditative practices:\n“A lot lot lot lot. After the blast I was majorly helped - writing affirmations. It helped me so\nmuch. I was in complete loss, not knowing what's happening, what the point of anything is. Self\nexistence questions that you ask yourself. One of the major affirmations, I am control of my\nreality even in times of uncertainty.\nThere's a beautiful instagram, called affirmation addict. Girl in California, I don't have the\napplication. I have a journal. I have a routine. Every two weeks. I cleanse my home with spiritual\nmusic. I started yoga. More meditation. I did a retreat for 5 days [...]\nI always have curiosity to learn more about these. They came at the right time. I have friends\nwho are more spiritual bess (but) i'm doing it alone. At my own pace. I have a collective of\nfriends around me that I'm inspired by.”\n-020 Interview\nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first established\ncan potentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths which support individuals' sense of\n23\n\nlife satisfaction and overall wellbeing is hypothesized to set a state of mind conducive to positive\nDeliberate Rumination.\nThe set of character strengths associated with our Deliberate Rumination dimension is\nJudgement, Social Intelligence and Teamwork. These traits do intuitively make sense as critical\nfactors for deliberate rumination and working together as a community to make difficult\ncollective decisions about traveling, building and relationships. We hope that by bringing a\ngreater awareness to these strengths of character people and programs will benefit from clearer\nthinking and more open discussion on what to do after difficulties arise.\nFreeze… or Laugh\nThe third response individuals have in the face of an overwhelmingly negative situation is to\nfreeze. In our interviews, we identify initial stages after the blast where many people felt stuck\nthrough expressing feelings of exasperation and frustration at the situation. Indicating they sense\na loss of control. These aspects connect to Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) through negating the\nopposite, post traumatic stress. Some of the symptoms of PTS are freezing, feeling numbness, an\ninability to act or care, holding one’s breath, a sense of dread…\nWhile it’s important not to overstate the case of PTS, in fact, most people respond quite\nresiliently as proposed by (Bonanno, G. A. 2004), also in order for people to experience the\npositive effects of PTG even the challenges and stressors of ordinary life can be enough of a\ntrigger to stimulate benefits (Ewert, A., & Tessneer, S. 2019). Before exploring people’s stress\nlet’s explore the positive correlations between PTGI and Character Strengths:\n24\n\nThe majority of the connection comes through the facet of PTGI-Appreciation.\n“...It's useless, they are not serving us by doing this. (Sharing news about the situation) They are\nproducing anger that can't turn into anything. The people are already angry from the economic\nissue. They don't have proof. One can sit and do theories for hours.”\n017 Interview\n“Khalas(exasperated form of “enough” in Arabic). I can't control anything… I need to control\nmy feelings thoughts rage.\n-020 Interview\n25\n\nAfter a month, yeah. In the first month I was consuming a lot of news about it and then I decided\nto stop. I was just depressing myself and I couldn't do anything about it and I disconnected\ncompletely and living my life as if nothing was going on. [[Code: Response-Self Protection]] I\nwasn't in Beirut, It wasn't as traumatic I was in Sawfar\n006 Interview\n“I didn't force myself to deal, when I wanted to cry. I was crying, when I didn't feel willing to do\nanything I didn't do anything.”\n010 Interview\nRather than freezing in response, some of the interviewees exhibited avoidant behaviors, which\nparallel freezing:\n“After the blast I didn't go to Beirut until just now. It was too heartbreaking, I didn't want to see\nit. We were impacted from the protests and the views. I was in a state of denial I didn't want to\nbelieve that this has happened. I only went yesterday because I //HAD// to get a vaccine. In some\nbuildings you see the effects of the blast, in other buildings it's been cleaned up.”\n010 Interview\nContrast the preceding statements with following statements which demonstrate interviewees\nengaging in highly motivated activities following the explosion:\n“When the blast happened, most businesses closed and people were cleaning up... When I was in\ngbeili - company, not antwork. I was looking at the employees and was thinking, don't you want\nto be in beirut helping other people? You could just go there and do something, this\npaperwork could be done another day.”\n019 Interview\n26\n\n“I still have nightmares, I have PTSD. Do you really want to know what it's like? I had some\ncalls with people from projectName. And suddenly the glass office I was in all collapsed and the\ncouch I was sitting on was full of glass. Allah itlatuf (God intervened with mercy) it was a matter\nof minutes. I was caught up on my way down to the floor below with my manager having a silly\ndiscussion when the blast happened. And the whole lower floor was full of blood, everyone had\nto be taken to the hospital. We were so scared to move. Because there were two we expected a\nthird. We all thought we were being blasted. Because of this we created a (product in response),\nit was a determination for us that (curseword) it we're staying. We're doing this for the country\ndespite all the (curse) we're living through. It was created after the blast as a demonstration\nthat we want to manufacture here, we want to create jobs, we want to build something for the\nkids that are deprived of toys, their childhood even.”\nhttps://roamresearch.com/#/app/EntrepreneurialResearch/page/ISYEjUAMD\nAggregating the pre-post tests from all the assessments we have before and after the blast, we\nfound that by segmenting our assessments by individuals in the entrepreneurial training program,\nthey have - on average - a one point increase in the measure of Humor in the VIA-IS inventory,\nover the course of the program. While Humor may be under-studied in academia, it correlates\nwith the CS prepost variable in our dataset.\n“CS Prepost” is a measure of the overall change in Character Strength before and after the Beirut\nPort Explosion. In the following table, we observe that humor and creativity both are factors\naffecting the preservation of Character Strengths. We used JASP and a classical regression\nmatrix since the variables are all continuous variables.\nSo what is a theory behind humor and this buffering effect? Humor has been linked to adaptive\ncoping and keeping a “light attitude” in the face of adversity (Ruch and Hofmann 2017). Humor\nis also an active response to take when other options are unavailable: people “break” the silence\nwith laughter, for example. This may be preventing the processes which lead to Learned\nHelplessness. Learned helplessness is one way to view the opposite of post traumatic growth for\n27\n\npeople living in highly chaotic and destabilized situations. Initially Learned Helplessness theory\nimplied that dogs experiencing inescapable shocks learned helplessness and persisted in helpless\nbehavior even when the situation became escapable later.\nRecent research has shed light on the neurological underpinnings of learned helplessness which\nhas application in uncertain times (Maier, S. F., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2016). Previously Learned\nHelplessness, as the name suggests, theorized that higher level mammals learn helpless behaviors\nwhen they are given inescapable negative experiences. Passivity in the face of a changed\nsituation, a situation where it behooves the animal to take action, is the hallmark of learned\nhelplessness. And while that behavior doesn’t change, our understanding of how it comes to be\nhas. Mammals, when confronted with prolonged adverse situations, develop an unlearned\nresponse of passivity. It is possible to overcome this bias towards passivity by learning and\nexerting control. What behaviors are available to act on?\nOne additional mechanism could have explanatory strength is the Broaden and Build theory\n(Fredrickson B. L. 2004) which espouses that positive emotions support people in expansive\nactivities, and taking action builds new capacity for further positive emotion, expansive activities\nand capacities. Humor combines the psychological insight and research from Fredrickson with\nthe neurological understandings of modern Learned Helplessness theory from (Maier, S. F., &\nSeligman, M. E. P. 2016). We can see that Humor is correlated with an overall growth of\ncharacter strengths from before and after the blast(CS prepost). Humor stands out as one of the\nonly factors that is directly connected to growth and stands out as a unique lens to look at both\nPTG(PTGI) and Resilience(BRCS) as it ties them all together as can be seen in the following\n28\n\nchart:\nThe court jester is the only person able to speak the truth when there is a crippling fear gripping\nthe court. Humor breaks the ice and we propose that it may also help sustain the neurological\nbasis for control. Humor is one of the factors we are exploring in this paper along the dimension\nof growth, the other is self reflection and emotional reappraisal through Deliberate Rumination\nand the third is Engagement as manifested in anger/political action as well as social\nentrepreneurial ideation.\nHumor, Engagement & Deliberate Rumination\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we investigated the Character Strength correlations with Resilience, Post\nTraumatic Growth and Deliberate Rumination. Since Character Strengths are correlated with\nPost Traumatic Growth and Wellbeing, and since there is a collection of applied interventions\nwith scientific validity, we hope this analysis helps educators working inside and outside\nconflict. The idea of “pre-silience” (pre+resilience) applies here with the recommendations for\nactions being more helpful in situations before there is a traumatic event.\nLet’s review the frame and identify the correlated character strengths:\n29\n\nHeading SDT Measure ->\nSupport\nCorrelated Character Strengths\nFight Engagement\nanger/political\nsocial\nentrepreneurial\nideation.\nAutonomy Resilience ->\nEngagement\nHope, Humor, Self-Regulation,\nSocial-Intelligence and Teamwork.\nFlight Deliberate\nRumination\nself reflection\nand emotional\nreappraisal\nRelatedness Deliberate\nRumination ->\nDialog\nJudgement, Social Intelligence and\nTeamwork.\nFreeze Growth\nHumor\nCompetency PTGI -> Growth Appreciation of Beauty, Fairness,\nHumor, Judgement, Leadership,\nModesty/Humility, Perspective,\nPrudence, Social Intelligence,\nSpirituality and Teamwork\nThe strengths that correlate with motivation and wellbeing with the highest correlations are\nTeamwork, Social Intelligence and Judgement.\nThe total list of strengths which emerged from our analysis is:\n1. Appreciation of Beauty\n2. Fairness\n3. Hope\n4. Humor\n5. Judgement\n6. Leadership\n7. Modesty/Humility\n30\n\n8. Prudence\n9. Perspective\n10. Self-Regulation\n11. Social Intelligence\n12. Spirituality\n13. Teamwork\nEveryone makes different decisions after a traumatic event, one size does not fit all in terms of\nhow best to design a pedagogy for social entrepreneurs. We hope this paper inspires more\nexploration around increasing motivation and wellbeing before the traumatic event, generating\n“presilience” so that when challenges come the psychological and social support are already in\nplace.\nOne thing is becoming more clear, it’s important to create spaces for truth speaking in the social\nentrepreneurship community, we must talk about our failures and fears as well as our successes.\nThese spaces can be where people explore ways of being and inspire each other through positive\nopen discussion around Character Strengths. These spaces could be a counter to the negativity\nbias seen on both social and traditional media. They offer a facilitated space to practice\ndeliberate rumination with the positive guidance of facilitators. It also supports the spread of\nvalue-laden idioms, aphorisms, and other easily digestible ideas, which become heuristics for\ndecision making.\nThe Character Strengths above come from a small sample study and the correlations do not\nimply causation. I hope this paper inspires others to take an applied approach to character\nstrengths explorations and also publish their data openly to build up a stronger evidence base for\nCharacter Strengths interventions.\n31\n\nI hope these findings make their way into communities of practice where social entrepreneurs\ncan collectively support each other to create the next viable steady-state system wherever they\nare.\nI want to end with two insights, one from one of the participants of the study and one from a\nfamous author:\n“...Values are the base of every human reaction and really, there's courage and motivation in\nevery person that's hidden and this very sad event created or awakened values in people. Those\nof compassion and courage, of motivation of solidarity and nationalism. Inspire nationalism even\nas people as they leaving the country. The people that are leaving the country, they still say my\ndream is to come back one day to Lebanon.\nMaybe they will go and come back.”\n--Interview 017\n“If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks\nand work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.”\n-Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\n32\n\nCitations:\nPeterson, C., & Seligman, M.

            "extracted_content": "ACSI End of Program Review\nCharacter Strengths and\nFostering Post-Traumatic Growth\n2020 brought many challenges to the already challenging field of Social\nEntrepreneurship. Especially in Lebanon, with the global pandemic, on top of local\nchallenges of the economic collapse, political instability, shortages of foods and\nmedicines, unemployment and the August 2020 explosion at the port of Beirut.\nIn our programs, and for impact monitoring, we utilize the Values in Action Character\nprofile (VIA). The VIA offers perspectives on aspects of being that make life\nworthwhile, and supports us in finding ways to help bring out people’s strengths in\npursuit of their social entrepreneurial aims.\nOur research found that wellbeing and life satisfaction correlate with self-efficacy\nand productivity factors. The more teams feel resourced to face the challenges of life\nand work, even in chaotic times, the better the outcomes for the teams and their\nsocial initiatives.\nBloom's research team is currently conducting qualitative and quantitative research\nto contextualize the changes seen within the Character Strengths of our participants.\nReviewing the data in the context of the challenges that people in Lebanon have\nfaced over the last year, the question was raised: How our programs may have had an\nimpact on the people who were part of our programs? We are interviewing\nparticipants that went through the full 6 month (originally planned as 4 month)\nAccelerator Program (May-October 2020) and those who only went through the 2\nweek Sprint Program (in April 2020) to deepen the understanding of how people\nrespond to and grow through challenging situations and how those responses differ\nwithin a program and outside a program. We’re doing this to identify better the\nfactors which lead to Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG is defined below) to then include\nthese factors more deeply into our programming.\nThis document describes a recently identified buffering effect for participants\nwithin the ACSI program on the measure of Character Strengths overall and a more\nsubstantial buffering effect on factors relating to Wellbeing and Life Satisfaction.\nPost-Traumatic Stress vs Post-Traumatic Growth\nTrauma and the accompanying stressors that persist do impact many people who go\nthrough an acute traumatic event, like the blast that went off in Beirut last year, or\n\nsustained challenges such as those emerging from the pandemic, economic\ncollapse, and others. Individuals may have trouble concentrating, flashbacks,\nsensitivity to similar situations, and other negative experiences that develop after a\ntraumatic event are called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). The research shows\nthat after a traumatic event, there are three main responses:\n● \nA small percentage of people who experience it develop PTSD,\n● \nThe majority of people show resilience and return to the pre-event state,\n● \nAnother minority demonstrates something called Post Traumatic Growth.\n(Jeon 2015)\nIn Post-Traumatic Growth, following a period after a traumatic event that is spent\ngrappling with the challenges - there is a period of growth whereby people develop\nnew strengths, see new possibilities, develop spiritually, develop closer relationships,\nand a deeper appreciation for life.\nThese days, more programs are becoming trauma-informed and are adapting\naccordingly, but there is little inclusion of this in entrepreneurship programs, and\nlittle research focusing on how entrepreneurship programs can better support\ncommunities during and after traumatic events, and better support post-traumatic\ngrowth. In an age of disruption and “new normals” understanding what supports\nPTG is critical.\n\nEvidence from the ACSI Program\nTo explore this further in the context of our programs, we have recently analyzed the\nCharacter Strengths profiles of people who went through our ACSI\nSprint+Accelerator program, versus those who just went through the ACSI Sprint\nProgram. For this cohort of participants, we have basic quantitative data that was\ncollected at the beginning of the Sprint period (in April 2020). A subset of teams was\nthen selected for the longer 4-month Accelerator program, which was extended to\nsix months due to the challenges in Lebanon and beyond. It’s important to note that\nthese are small scale studies with 13 participants within our accelerator program and\n17 participants within the Sprint only program.\nThe same quantitative assessment was conducted in December 2020-January 2021,\nwith the initial results shared here. Follow-on qualitative interviews will be conducted\nin the following two months.\nFrom an aggregated view, the ACSI program seemed to prevent a drop in overall\ncharacter strengths. We collected samples of the ACSI Sprinters character Strengths\nprofile at the beginning of the program during the sprint period. We re-assessed\nagain for both people who participated only in the sprint and participants who\ncompleted the ACSI Accelerator program. By comparing the pre/post changes across\nall 24 Character Strengths, we see that the ACSI teams had a small .2 point increase\nin their aggregated scores compared to the teams not a part of the Accelerator\nprogram who experienced a .6 point drop.\n\nThis exploration led to identifying that the impact of our program had a more\nsubstantial buffering effect on the facets that supported Life-Satisfaction and\nWellbeing:\nTrait\nCorrelation w/\nWellbeing\nCorrelation w/\nLife Satisfaction\nChange / Accelerator\nFor Accel Teams\nChange / Accelerator\nFor Non-Accel Teams\nBuffering\neffect\nHope \nr = .30 r = .53 -0.04 -1.43 1.39\nLove \nr = .18 r = .35 -0.27 -1.84 1.57\nHumor \nr = .25 r = .26 1.12 -0.55 1.67\nCuriosity \nr = .25 r = .39 0.96 -0.52 1.48\nZest \nr = .34 r = .52 0.35 -0.77 1.11\nGratitude \nr = .21 r = .43 -0.15 -0.73 0.58\nAverage \nr = .26 r = .41 0.12 -0.58 1.25\nIt is interesting to note is the development of humor within our programs, humor\nhas been linked to adaptive coping and keeping a light attitude in the face of\nadversity (Ruch and Hofmann 2017).\nData on Wellbeing from: (Gander, F., Hofmann 2019)\nData on Life Satisfaction from: Park, N., Peterson, C., & Seligman, M.

Hope and Persistence have been\ndemonstrated to be malleable Character Strengths (Gander 2019) and also have high\ncorrelations with Entrepreneurial Success (Worell 2011) as well as Life Satisfaction\n(Park, N., Peterson, C., & Seligman 2004) and Wellbeing (Gander 2019). We\nhypothesize the combination of the malleability of the trait along with correlations\nwith factors that can support entrepreneurs make these traits good candidates for\nstrengthening over the course of a program.\nPractical Program Applications of our Hypotheses\nA key objective of our programmatic approach in Bloom is to combine these critical\naspects of character and universal skills development into our entrepreneurial\nsupport programs, since success of social impact and traditional enterprises is\nintimately connected to the capacities of the team, especially founding and early\nteam, of an enterprise. The more effective programs can be on both enterprise and\npersonal development factors, the more impactful the programs can be both in the\nshort-term and long-term. This is even more critical in emerging ecosystems and\nmarginalized/vulnerable communities where character and skill development\nopportunities are less available, and where exposure to acute and sustained\ntraumatic experiences are more common.\nFurther Exploration\nFurther exploration will be how to deepen the factors supporting these traits and\nengender post-traumatic growth for an age of instability and chaos. Some of the\nfactors that are correlated with increased potential for Post Traumatic Growth are\nSocial Support as well as Deliberate Rumination (Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J.\n2011).\n\n(Morris, B. A., & Shakespeare-Finch, J. 2011).\nThe programmatic implications of the factor analysis above along with the\nassessment of strengths open lines of inquiry about the potential benefit of making\nconscious the discussion of strengths. Deliberate Rumination is the process of\nchoosing the questions and thoughts one has around a traumatic event, for instance\n“what is the lesson I am learning through this” in contrast with Intrusive Rumination\nand Brooding which may take the tone of “why is this always happening to me”.\nIncluding moments of Deliberate Rumination in a social setting where trust is first\nestablished can potentially support PTG. Including a focus on Strengths which\nsupport individuals' sense of life satisfaction and overall wellbeing is hypothesized to\nset a state of mind conducive to positive Deliberate Rumination. A traumatic event is\ndestabilizing to the individual since it can shatter mental models, self image and\nworldviews, the possibility of rebuilding these offer a potential avenue for change\nand positive growth for the individual given the right context, environment and\nsupport (Roepke, A. M., & Seligman, M. E. P. 2014). Over the course of one’s life the\nmajority (> 60% across many countries) of people will experience an event which they\nreport as traumatic (Scott, K. M., Koenen 2013).\n\nThe chart above shows that traumatic events offer a transformational potential for\nindividuals. Bloom hypothesizes that Social Entrepreneurship programs can provide\nthe scaffolding that can support the development of PTG, personal growth and\npositive societal impact by engaging individuals with New Possibilities (Roepke, A.\nM., & Seligman) through their enterprises, offering positive social support, facilitating\nmoments of collective positive rumination, as well as making visible and\nencouraging growth of the Character Strengths which promote life satisfaction and\nwellbeing. Programs which take this into consideration are hypothesized to support\nindividuals going through trauma and create framing which help guide them\ntowards becoming personal transformational experiences that lead to societal\ntransformational experiences.\n\n(Roepke, A. M., & Seligman 2014)\nFurther qualitative research will be conducted to explore the previous hypothesis\nand provide insights to factors that may not yet be expressed in the current\nliterature.\nReferences:\nMorris, B.

Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nincrease stability. In these countries, the entrepreneurial landscape is non-ideal due\nto the additional challenges within the political and economic landscape. Potential\nviolence and social unrest entrepreneurs must deal with plus the usual stress and\nchallenges of operating an enterprise. The additional stressors of an entrepreneur\nworking in a conflict-prone area on top of the challenges of capitalising and\noperating in conditions of uncertainty shine a light on the need to understand\nemotion, affect, character strengths and resilience alongside more traditional\neconomic and entrepreneurial measures.\nThe insights gained from the edge cases of entrepreneurship education will bear\nfruit for educators, policymakers, and multinational NGOs who seek a sustainable\ndevelopment path. Challenges and stressors confront anyone wanting to create\nchange and identifying cross-culturally relevant interventions to nurture resilience\nand support entrepreneurial orientation, action, and success will be beneficial.\n2/ Presentation of references\nTo clarify the challenges and opportunities presented to governments, universities\nand other entrepreneurial ecosystem facilitators this review goes over a subset of the\nliterature discussing:\n● \nEntrepreneurial Intent (Zhao, Seibert, & Hills, 2005),\n● \nEntrepreneurial Orientation and Intent\n● \nEntrepreneurial Cognition and Action\nAnd viewing them in relation to:\n● \nSelf-efficacy (Benight & Bandura, 2004)\n● \nResilience / Post Traumatic Growth\n● \nEmotion / Affect - as mood and passions (Baron 2008)\n● \nAnd hope - defined as a cognitive capability in as opposed to an emotion\n(Arend 2020).\nWithin this literature review, the following relevant questions were salient in regards\nto identifying the factors relating to entrepreneurial intent and action in conflicted\nareas:\n1. \nWhat mediates entrepreneurial self-efficacy?\n2. \nHow do conflict and trauma promote or demote the factors leading to\nentrepreneurial motivation and action?\n3. \nWhat interventions enhance the promoting factors and inhibit the demoting\nfactors leading to entrepreneurial motivation and action?\nConcepts\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nWithin question 1, we identified the concepts of positive affect (Bernoster et al. -\n2020), and metacognition as factors that support entrepreneurial self-efficacy.\nWithin question 2, we identified the concepts of Post-Traumatic\nGrowth(Shakespeare-Finch 2011), Brooding VS Rumination (Garcia 2014), and Hope\n(as cognitive capability VS emotion).\nConceptual Map Example: Positive Affect mediates between Self Efficacy and Innovative\nBehaviors.\nWithin question 3 we identified the concepts of Signature Strengths training within\nthe Values in Action Character Strengths model (Schutte and Malouff - 2019),\nReappraisals and positive reinterpretation (Scheier, Weintraub, & Carver, 1986),\nDeliberate Rumination, Benefit Finding (Ai et al. 2005), and Social Support.\nThe surveyed papers demonstrate a lack of specificity between positive affect, life\nsatisfaction, and happiness (Schutte 2019).\nResults\nIt is clear that affect matters. The literature reviewed demonstrates that positive\naffect mediates the relationship between self-efficacy and the innovative behavior of\nentrepreneurs. (Mielniczuk 2020) which aligns with (Bandura, 1997)’s explanation of\nhow self-efficacy enhances wellbeing and outcomes.\n(Uy et al. 2017) demonstrated that higher Affect Spin (the dynamics of changing\nmood/feelings) impedes progress on entrepreneurial milestones. The impact\nremains, regardless of the type of affect Spin - either entirely within the positive\nrange or ranging from positive to negative. Affect stability is related to wellbeing and\nwellbeing pertaining to goal orientation and goal orientation to supporting venture\nprogress.\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nWhat inhibits progress for entrepreneurs in conflict and challenged areas? Across\nstudies, we find that intrusive rumination and brooding stemming from a traumatic\nevent mediate the relationship between subjective and post-traumatic symptoms\n(García 2015). The monitoring that comes from a metacognitive perspective can be\nrelated to intrusive rumination. In (Learning 2015) we see that metacognition is the\nmediating factor between Social Support and Wellbeing.\nThe previous results demonstrate the correlates of affect and internal narrative to\nentrepreneurial behaviors and intention. Metacognition also plays a vital role as a\nmediator of wellbeing while highlighting a question of the role metacognitive\nprocesses have in types of rumination.\nContinuing the explanation of trauma, rumination and wellbeing as factors upstream\nto entrepreneurial outcomes (Triplett, Tedeschi, Cann, Calhoun and Reeve 2012)\nconducted a path analysis to identify how traumatic experiences lead to increased\nlife satisfaction. They identified the process of Deliberate Rumination (sometimes\nmediated/triggered by Intrusive Rumination) to be a core factor.\nMeaning and story making is a subtext across much of the literature read about\ntrauma and entrepreneurship. It is a concept which underlies rumination in the\npreviously discussed studies. As described in (Janoff-Bulman 1989) - a traumatic\nevent may lead to posttraumatic stress due to a break in our assumptive worlds, the\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nschema we come to expect is no longer relevant. Meaning connects things, and\ntraumatic events and disruption disconnect them (Park 2010). It is becoming clear\nthat one way Deliberate Rumination supports Post-Traumatic Growth and through\nthat can support entrepreneurship in the developing world is through the\naccompanying resilience of PTG and the reappraisal and the telling of a new story.\nThe relationship between deliberate and intrusive rumination, affect, and action is\nbecoming a clear exploration area. (Baumeister and Wilson, 1996) identified four\nneeds for meaning: Need for purpose, need for value/justification, the need for\nefficacy, and finally the need for self-worth. (Bullough et al., 2014) have demonstrated\na relationship between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and resilience with\nEntrepreneurial Intent. The integration of self-efficacy between the needs for\nmeaning and a component supporting entrepreneurial intent demonstrates the\ncomplex web of effects that inspire or dim the light on entrepreneurship\nmotivations.\nLastly, Posttraumatic Growth is identified through the development of specific\ncharacter strengths. (Peterson 2008) demonstrated the development of particular\nCharacter Strengths for individuals who have gone through a traumatic experience\nat some time in their lives. Peterson identified this growth an arbitrarily long time\nafter the traumatic event without conducting an intervention; this is intriguing since\nit reinforces the theory (Bonanno 2004) proposes - that resilience and Post-traumatic\ngrowth are the general response most people undergo posttraumatic experience as\na part of the natural healing process. While Bonanno suggests that some\ninterventions (journaling to help with reappraisal) may encourage Post-Traumatic\nGrowth, the research demonstrates many paths to PTG and many people find it\nindependently. An uplifting perspective.\n4/ Limits of the existing studies\nMeasurement challenges:\nThe majority of the papers in this study used self-reported measures and\nrecommended alternative approaches to assessing factors. (Bernoster et al. - 2020)\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nIssues with non-longitudinal studies: How to define success? Measuring Self\nEfficacy and Resilience, as correlates to Entrepreneurial Intent (Bullough 2013), found\nconvincing evidence. However, without measuring entrepreneurial behavior and\nentrepreneurship impact (jobs created, families sustained, the positive impact of\nentrepreneurial activities), the demonstration of the correlation between resilience\nand self-efficacy with entrepreneurial intentions opens the doors to longitudinal\nstudies exploring outcomes of those intentions.\nAlong with desiring to validate their study across in diverse cultures outside Spain\nand Portugal, (Mortan 2014) identified that their research is limited by the shortage\nof empirical evidence on the relationship amongst Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy and\nhow it is related to Emotional Intelligence and Entrepreneurial Intention. (Mortan\n2014)\n5/ Research question\nSome questions emerge after reviewing the literature: How does engaging in an\nentrepreneurial task impact emotions - how are they reciprocal? Are there\npositive/negative spirals, and how what starts them, stops them, encourages them?\nWhat are the interrelationships between emotion and cognition and entrepreneurial\nphenomena (Shepherd, 2015)? What is the relationship between metacognition,\nrumination and entrepreneurial self-efficacy?\nAll important questions. Due to prior acquisition of Character Strengths Data\n(pre/post) for people within and without an entrepreneurship program (ACSI)\nidentifying changes and after the Beirut Blast of 2020, there is an opportunity to ask\na new question:\nWhat factors supported the development of Character Strengths and PTG for\nentrepreneurs in Lebanon after the Beirut Blast?\nThe relevant factors can be determined through qualitative interview referencing\nsome of the concepts referred to in this literature review (rumination, PTG,\n\nM2 Lesc 20-21 - U.E. Research Project - A. Legavre & N. de Chanaud\nmetacognition, social support, etc.). A theoretical model will be developed to identify\nthe strongest correlations that buffered the individuals within the ACSI program\nfrom a 1 point drop in their Character Strengths their peers outside the program\nexperienced. This knowledge will support other entrepreneurial educators in\nsimilarly challenging environments to improve their programs and support\nentrepreneurs working to create a better world. This knowledge will help conflict\nzone entrepreneurs grow from their challenges, like a phoenix.\n6/ Reference\nGorgievski, M. J., & Stephan, U. (2016).

            "extracted_content": "To derive unique and valuable insights from the interviews, it's essential to analyze the recurring themes, unique experiences, and the interplay of various factors highlighted by the participants. Here's a step-by-step approach to uncover additional insights and analogies from the interviews:\n\nStep 1: Identify Recurring Themes\nPost-Traumatic Growth (PTG): Many participants discuss growth following adversity, indicating that certain factors contribute to resilience and recovery.\nCharacter Strengths and Values: Themes like courage, perseverance, and hope frequently appear.\nHumor and Coping Mechanisms: Several interviewees mention using humor and creativity as ways to cope with trauma.\nSocial Support: The importance of family, friends, and community support is emphasized.\nEntrepreneurial Spirit: Despite adversity, participants show a strong inclination toward entrepreneurship and innovation.\nStep 2: Extract Unique Analogies and Insights\nAnalogy of Resilience as a Muscle:\n\nResilience can be compared to a muscle that strengthens through use. Just as muscles grow stronger with repeated stress and recovery, individuals develop resilience by facing and overcoming adversities. This analogy can illustrate how the participants' repeated exposure to challenges has fortified their resilience over time.\nEntrepreneurial Ecosystem as a Garden:\n\nThe entrepreneurial ecosystem in a post-crisis environment can be likened to a garden. Just as a garden requires nurturing, proper conditions, and protection from external threats, the entrepreneurial ecosystem needs support, resources, and stability to thrive. This analogy can highlight the participants' need for a conducive environment to foster innovation and growth.\nHumor as a Pressure Valve:\n\nHumor can be described as a pressure valve that releases the emotional tension built up from traumatic experiences. This analogy helps explain how participants use humor to manage stress and maintain their mental health, providing a unique perspective on coping mechanisms.\nSocial Support as a Safety Net:\n\nSocial support functions as a safety net, catching individuals when they fall and helping them bounce back. This analogy underscores the crucial role of family, friends, and community in the participants' recovery and resilience.\nPost-Traumatic Growth as a Phoenix:\n\nPost-traumatic growth can be likened to a phoenix rising from the ashes. Despite the destruction and loss, individuals emerge stronger, wiser, and more capable. This powerful imagery can encapsulate the transformative journey of the participants.\nStep 3: Highlight Unique Insights\nRole of Entrepreneurial Training in Resilience:\n\nEntrepreneurial training programs not only equip individuals with business skills but also foster resilience and adaptive thinking. This dual benefit suggests that such programs could be an effective tool in presilience training, preparing individuals to handle future adversities better.\nInterplay of Humor and Social Support:\n\nThe combination of humor and social support creates a powerful coping mechanism. Humor helps to lighten the emotional burden, while social support provides practical and emotional assistance. Together, they form a comprehensive support system for individuals facing trauma.\nCultural Context of Resilience:\n\nThe cultural context significantly influences resilience and coping mechanisms. In the case of Lebanese participants, the cultural emphasis on community, familial support, and entrepreneurial spirit plays a pivotal role in their resilience. This insight can contribute to the broader understanding of how cultural factors impact post-traumatic growth.\nImpact of Systemic Factors on Individual Resilience:\n\nSystemic issues like political instability and economic collapse profoundly affect individual resilience. Participants' narratives highlight how external factors can either hinder or enhance their ability to recover and grow. This insight emphasizes the need for systemic changes to support individual resilience.\nAdaptive Innovation in Crisis:\n\nThe crisis has spurred adaptive innovation among participants. Faced with limited resources and numerous challenges, they have developed creative solutions to sustain their businesses and support their communities. This demonstrates the potential for crises to drive innovation and resourcefulness.\nStep 4: Propose Unique Research Contributions\nStudy on Presilience Training Through Entrepreneurial Programs:\n\nResearch how entrepreneurial training programs can serve as presilience training, enhancing individuals' resilience before a crisis occurs.\nHumor and Social Support in Coping with Trauma:\n\nInvestigate the synergistic effects of humor and social support on post-traumatic growth and resilience.\nCultural Influences on Resilience and Post-Traumatic Growth:\n\nExplore how cultural values and practices shape resilience and coping mechanisms in different populations.\nSystemic Factors and Individual Resilience:\n\nExamine the relationship between systemic issues (e.g., political instability, economic conditions) and individual resilience and post-traumatic growth.\nAdaptive Innovation in Crisis Environments:\n\nAnalyze how crises stimulate adaptive innovation and resourcefulness among affected populations.\nBy synthesizing these insights and analogies, you can develop a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to post-traumatic growth and resilience, potentially making significant contributions to academic literature in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\ncan you pull 3 quotes from the interviews for each reoccurring theme? \nChatGPT\nSearching the web...\n\nHere are three quotes from the interviews for each reoccurring theme identified:\n\n1. Post-Traumatic Growth\n\"I developed new interests. Before that I had a lot of dreams, interests. The combination of the startup, being fully focused on work... Having so many restrictions on going on, what you can/can't do increased barriers to reconnect with interests.\"\n\"I have a greater feeling of self-reliance. I've always had that, I've always taken care of myself despite all of my conditions.\"\n\"I have a better understanding of spiritual matters. Normally when these things happen you would think that this might have happened to me, you think more about religion especially when it comes to death.\"​​\n2. Character Strengths and Values\n\"My therapist has been the #1 support. When the startup was going down, the failure of the startup got me thinking I was a failure... Acquiring new skills empowers me to feel like I have the chance to at some point do what I want to do in life.\"\n\"I more clearly see that I can count on people in times of trouble. Four because I don't like to get close to people. Everything that sounds negative. If I was asked.\"\n\"Having a tough life is not something we can escape. I have a greater feeling of self-reliance.\"\n3. Humor and Coping Mechanisms\n\"I tried not to think about it. First month, yes, after. no. Even now when I see it on the news I disconnect.\"\n\"I had trouble falling asleep. Bing netflix/youtube/read a book till I drop. Margaret atwood book, austrix and clayke? Kindle as well.\"\n\"I noticed certain times recently I'm not in control of how I'm reacting. Slowly I'm gaining my control, I allowed myself to react in any way I wanted and I'm gaining my control again. No reason, just expression.\"\n4. Social Support\n\"I have a strong tie with my fiance and brother... we're in it together, even the team is with us. When we see we can make a change with a single person it gives us a bit more courage, we had to always show positivity.\"​​\n\"I more clearly see that I can count on people in times of trouble. I used to be a control freak and now I can see that other people can bring value and I can bring value.\"\n\"Before I wouldn't want any help from others, now I allow others to help me. Not a lot and not everyone. Part of my character is to not ask for help, difficult to open for anyone.\"\n5. Entrepreneurial Spirit\n\"I took my decision to stay to think about my career first before thinking about leaving.\"\n\"In Marsielle I had to spend 7 days on the streets with no food to keep investing in the company. Got back a certain amount of investment after 7 days.\"\n\"Our feelings were a drive towards what we're doing.\"​​\nThese quotes reflect the recurring themes identified and provide insights into the experiences and perspectives of the interviewees."

This angle allows you to delve into the cognitive and emotional processes that underlie resilience and growth, while also considering the social factors that support these processes.\n\nExploring how social support provides a framework or \"rails\" for individuals to engage in deliberate rumination and reappraisal is a novel perspective. Additionally, investigating the role of humor in discharging the nervous system and promoting a more flexible, analogical thinking style can provide valuable insights into the cognitive dimensions of resilience.\n\nIncorporating the concept of \"presilience\" and the importance of prior trauma in shaping entrepreneurs' ability to cope with future challenges is also a strong angle. This ties in well with your findings on the significance of previous difficult experiences and the resources individuals drew upon to overcome them.\n\nRegarding your question about writing multiple papers or a meta-paper strategy, here are some pros and cons to consider:\n\nMultiple Papers:\nPros:\n- Allows for in-depth exploration of specific aspects of your research (e.g., deliberate rumination, humor, social support)\n- Provides opportunities for targeted contributions to different subfields or research areas\n- Increases your publication count and visibility within the academic community\nCons:\n- May lack the cohesiveness and broader impact of a single, comprehensive paper\n- Requires more time and effort to develop and publish multiple papers\n- May not fully capture the interplay and synergistic effects of the various factors you've identified\n\nMeta-Paper Strategy:\nPros:\n- Enables you to present a comprehensive, integrated framework for understanding entrepreneurial resilience and post-traumatic growth\n- Highlights the interconnectedness of cognitive, emotional, and social factors in fostering resilience\n- Offers a more impactful, \"big picture\" contribution to the field\nCons:\n- May be more challenging to develop and execute, requiring a strong theoretical foundation and synthesis of complex ideas\n- Risks oversimplifying or neglecting the nuances of specific factors in favor of a broader perspective\n- May face challenges in finding a suitable publication outlet or audience for a more unconventional, meta-level analysis\n\nTo help you make a decision, consider the following questions:\n\n1. Which approach aligns best with your research goals and desired impact? Are you aiming for targeted contributions to specific subfields, or a more comprehensive, integrative framework?\n\n2. Given your data and the scope of your findings, which strategy do you feel most confident in executing successfully? Do you have sufficient depth and breadth to support a meta-paper, or would multiple focused papers be more feasible?\n\n3. What are your priorities in terms of publication timeline, career goals, and academic visibility? Would multiple papers or a single high-impact meta-paper better serve these objectives?\n\nUltimately, the choice between multiple papers or a meta-paper strategy depends on your research vision, data, and professional goals.

Subfield: Positive Psychology\n\nTitle: Humor as a Catalyst for Post-Traumatic Growth Among Entrepreneurs\nSubtitle: Exploring the Role of Humor in Fostering Resilience and Thriving in Adverse Contexts\nAbstract:\nThis study investigates the significant role of humor as a coping mechanism and catalyst for post-traumatic growth among entrepreneurs operating in challenging contexts. Drawing on qualitative data from 21 interviews with entrepreneurs who experienced the 2020 Beirut Port explosion, we explore how humor facilitates resilience, cognitive reappraisal, and personal growth in the wake of adversity. Our findings reveal that humor serves as a powerful tool for entrepreneurs to discharge stress, maintain a flexible mindset, and find meaning in difficult experiences. We propose a conceptual model that highlights the mechanisms through which humor contributes to post-traumatic growth and discuss the implications for entrepreneurial training and support interventions. This research contributes to the growing literature on positive psychology and entrepreneurial resilience, offering new insights into the transformative potential of humor in the face of adversity.\n\n2. Subfield: Entrepreneurship\n\nTitle: Presilience: How Prior Adversity Builds Entrepreneurial Resilience\nSubtitle: Lessons from Entrepreneurs in Conflict Zones\nAbstract:\nEntrepreneurial resilience is critical for navigating the challenges and uncertainties of starting and growing a business, particularly in conflict zones and unstable environments. This study introduces the concept of \"presilience\" – the resilience built through prior experiences of adversity – and examines its role in shaping entrepreneurs' ability to cope with and grow from subsequent challenges. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with 21 entrepreneurs operating in Lebanon during the 2020 Beirut Port explosion, we identify key themes and patterns in how prior adversity influences entrepreneurial mindset, decision-making, and coping strategies. Our findings suggest that entrepreneurs who have successfully navigated past challenges develop a set of adaptive skills, support networks, and psychological resources that enhance their resilience in the face of new crises. We discuss the implications of these findings for entrepreneurial education and ecosystem support, highlighting the potential for resilience-focused interventions and policies. This research contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by shedding light on the understudied role of prior adversity in building entrepreneurial resilience and offers valuable insights for entrepreneurs operating in challenging contexts.\n\n3. Subfield: Organizational Behavior\n\nTitle: The Resilience Trifecta: How Social Support, Humor, and Deliberate Rumination Synergize to Promote Growth Among Entrepreneurs\nSubtitle: An Examination of Coping Mechanisms in the Aftermath of the Beirut Port Explosion\nAbstract:\nEntrepreneurial resilience is a multifaceted construct that draws on a range of psychological, social, and cognitive resources. This study examines the interplay of three key factors – social support, humor, and deliberate rumination – in promoting resilience and growth among entrepreneurs in the aftermath of the 2020 Beirut Port explosion. Through a qualitative analysis of 21 interviews with entrepreneurs, we explore how these factors synergistically contribute to effective coping, sense-making, and personal growth in the wake of adversity. Our findings reveal that social support provides a foundation for entrepreneurs to process their experiences, while humor serves as a catalyst for cognitive reappraisal and stress relief. Deliberate rumination, in turn, allows entrepreneurs to find meaning, learn from their experiences, and chart a path forward. We propose a theoretical model that integrates these three factors and discuss the implications for organizational interventions and entrepreneurial support systems. This research contributes to the organizational behavior literature by offering new insights into the complex interplay of coping mechanisms in the context of entrepreneurial resilience and highlights the importance of fostering a supportive and growth-oriented organizational culture.",

Drawing on positive psychology, this study investigates the role of character strengths in facilitating post-traumatic growth among entrepreneurs who experienced the 2020 Beirut Port explosion. Through a mixed-methods approach, we examine how specific character strengths, such as bravery, perseverance, and hope, contribute to entrepreneurs' ability to find meaning, build resilience, and thrive in the aftermath of crisis. Our findings challenge the traditional view of adversity as purely negative, highlighting the potential for adversity to catalyze growth and reveal inner strengths.

Through in-depth interviews with 21 entrepreneurs, we uncover the strategies and mindsets that enabled them to adapt, innovate, and thrive in the face of adversity. Our findings highlight the crucial role of resourcefulness, flexibility, and creative problem-solving in building entrepreneurial resilience. We identify specific approaches, such as leveraging social networks, pivoting business models, and embracing uncertainty, that entrepreneurs employed to navigate the challenges and seize opportunities for innovation. Drawing on these insights, we propose a framework for resilient innovation in conflict zones and discuss the implications for entrepreneurship education, policy, and practice. This research contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by shedding light on the under-explored realm of entrepreneurship in conflict zones and offers valuable lessons for building resilient and innovative ventures in adverse environments.\n\n3.

This study investigates the role of organizational support in promoting entrepreneur resilience and well-being in the aftermath of the 2020 Beirut Port explosion. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with 21 entrepreneurs, we explore how various forms of organizational support, such as peer networks, mentorship, and mental health resources, contributed to entrepreneurs' ability to cope with trauma, maintain their mental health, and continue to lead their ventures. Our findings underscore the importance of creating trauma-informed entrepreneurial ecosystems that prioritize entrepreneur well-being alongside business support.

            "extracted_content": "Understanding the Mechanisms of Humor: Finding Light in Dark Times\nPhilosophical Perspective on Humor:\n\nHumor is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves cognitive, emotional, and social processes. From a philosophical standpoint, humor can be understood through several theories and mechanisms, particularly in the context of finding humor in dark times.\n\nTheories of Humor\nIncongruity Theory:\n\nConcept: Humor arises when there is a discrepancy between what is expected and what actually occurs. This surprise element creates a cognitive shift that can lead to laughter.\nApplication in Dark Times: In moments of crisis, incongruity can manifest in absurd or unexpected situations, such as finding a moment of normalcy or irony amidst chaos. For example, laughing at the absurdity of a small, everyday inconvenience occurring during a major disaster can highlight the stark contrast and provide relief.\nRelief Theory:\n\nConcept: Humor acts as a release for psychological tension and suppressed emotions. Laughter helps to alleviate stress and anxiety.\nApplication in Dark Times: When people are under significant stress, humor can serve as a coping mechanism to release built-up tension. Jokes about the stressful situation itself or related challenges can help individuals momentarily escape their worries and find a sense of control.\nSuperiority Theory:\n\nConcept: Humor often involves a feeling of superiority over others or over a previous version of oneself. This theory suggests that we find humor in the misfortunes or mistakes of others.\nApplication in Dark Times: While this theory might seem less appropriate in dark times, self-deprecating humor can allow individuals to laugh at their own past mistakes or fears, creating a sense of mastery over their circumstances.\nBenign Violation Theory:\n\nConcept: Humor occurs when something perceived as a violation (e.g., a moral or social norm) is simultaneously perceived as benign (i.e., not harmful or serious).\nApplication in Dark Times: In crises, certain taboos or serious subjects can become sources of humor if framed in a way that minimizes their threatening nature. For instance, joking about minor inconveniences during a disaster can make the situation seem less dire.\nMechanisms of Finding Humor in Dark Times\nShared Experience and Solidarity:\n\nMechanism: Humor can strengthen social bonds by creating a sense of camaraderie and shared understanding. Laughing together about a difficult situation can foster a collective sense of resilience.\nExample: Making light-hearted comments about common struggles (e.g., power outages, long queues) during a crisis can bring people together and reduce feelings of isolation.\nTemporal Distance:\n\nMechanism: As time passes, people can find humor in past traumas because the emotional intensity decreases. This distance allows individuals to reflect on the absurdity or irony of the situation.\nExample: Looking back at the initial panic buying during a pandemic and laughing about the rush for toilet paper can provide a sense of perspective and relief.\nReframing and Perspective Shifts:\n\nMechanism: Humor allows for reframing a situation from a different perspective, often highlighting the absurdity or triviality of certain aspects of a serious event.\nExample: A person might joke about their \"new workout routine\" involving running up and down stairs to check on supplies, reframing a stressful activity into a humorous one.\nDark Humor:\n\nMechanism: Dark humor involves finding amusement in subjects that are generally considered serious, painful, or taboo. It provides a way to confront and process the harsh realities of life.\nExample: Making jokes about bureaucratic inefficiencies during disaster relief efforts can highlight frustrations in a way that feels more manageable and less overwhelming.\nPlayfulness and Absurdity:\n\nMechanism: Engaging in playful or absurd behavior can break the monotony and tension of dark times, allowing for a mental break and emotional release.\nExample: Creating humorous memes or skits about the situation can provide a playful outlet for expressing fears and frustrations.\nPractical Ways to Cultivate Humor in Dark Times\nEncouraging Laughter:\n\nWatch comedies, share funny videos, or read humorous books that can provide a break from the seriousness of the situation.\nConnecting with Others:\n\nShare funny stories or jokes with friends and family. Social interaction, even through humor, can strengthen bonds and provide mutual support.\nFinding Irony:\n\nLook for ironic or absurd elements in the situation. Recognizing these can help frame the experience in a less threatening light.\nAllowing Self-Deprecation:\n\nDon’t be afraid to laugh at your own missteps or fears. Self-deprecating humor can reduce the power of the situation over you.\nEmbracing Playfulness:\n\nEngage in playful activities or games that encourage laughter and joy, even if they are simple or silly.\nConclusion\nHumor in dark times serves as a powerful tool for emotional resilience, social bonding, and psychological relief. By understanding the mechanisms and theories of humor, individuals can intentionally cultivate moments of laughter and lightness, even amidst adversity. This not only provides immediate relief but also fosters a longer-term sense of hope and community.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some questions that promote deliberate rumination that might have some facets of this type of humor\nChatGPT\nDeliberate rumination involves thoughtful reflection on one's experiences, often with the goal of finding meaning, understanding, or growth. Incorporating humor into deliberate rumination can make the process lighter and more accessible, helping individuals to reframe their experiences in a less threatening and more constructive way. Here are some questions that promote deliberate rumination with facets of humor:\n\nQuestions for Deliberate Rumination with Humor\nReframing the Experience:\n\n\"What’s the funniest thing that happened during that difficult time, and why did it make you laugh?\"\n\"Looking back, what’s a moment that was so absurd it almost felt like a scene from a comedy movie?\"\nFinding Irony and Absurdity:\n\n\"What’s the most ironic thing about the situation that still makes you shake your head and laugh?\"\n\"If you were to write a humorous skit about one of your experiences, what would the funniest scene be?\"\nSelf-Deprecating Humor:\n\n\"What was a moment when you felt like you were in over your head, but now you can laugh about it?\"\n\"Can you think of a time when you tried to solve a problem and it hilariously backfired?\"\nHumor in Adversity:\n\n\"Who or what helped you find humor in the darkest moments, and how did it help you cope?\"\n\"What’s a joke or funny saying that became a catchphrase for you and your friends or family during that time?\"\nPerspective Shifts:\n\n\"What’s something you used to take very seriously that you now find a bit silly or funny?\"\n\"If you could go back and give your past self some humorous advice, what would it be?\"\nShared Laughter:\n\n\"What’s a funny story from that period that you often share with others to lighten the mood?\"\n\"Can you think of a time when laughter unexpectedly broke the tension in a difficult situation?\"\nPersonal Growth through Humor:\n\n\"How has your sense of humor changed as a result of going through that experience?\"\n\"What’s a humorous lesson you learned from that time that still sticks with you?\"\nComic Relief:\n\n\"What was your go-to source of comic relief during that challenging period?\"\n\"Is there a funny memory from that time that, despite everything, still brings a smile to your face?\"\nHow These Questions Promote Deliberate Rumination with Humor\nEncouraging Reflection: These questions prompt individuals to reflect deeply on their experiences, often bringing to light moments of levity that may have been overlooked.\nReframing Negative Experiences: By finding humor in adversity, these questions help reframe negative experiences in a more positive or neutral light, reducing their emotional impact.\nBuilding Resilience: Humor can build resilience by allowing individuals to see the lighter side of difficult situations, fostering a sense of control and optimism.\nStrengthening Social Bonds: Shared laughter and humorous stories can strengthen social bonds, creating a sense of community and mutual support.\nEnhancing Cognitive Flexibility: Humor encourages cognitive flexibility, helping individuals to see their experiences from different perspectives and think more creatively about solutions and coping strategies.\nConclusion\nIncorporating humor into deliberate rumination can make the reflective process more engaging and less intimidating. These questions not only promote thoughtful reflection on one’s experiences but also help to identify and appreciate the lighter moments, fostering a balanced and resilient mindset.\n\ncome up with a matrix and come up with 2 questions per section of the matrix to get as broad a list of good questions as possible in the possibility space\nChatGPT\nDeliberate Rumination with Humor Matrix\nThe matrix below is designed to cover various aspects of deliberate rumination while incorporating humor.

This approach allows you to focus on specific aspects of your research while creating a cohesive narrative that highlights the significance of your work.\n\nPaper 1: The Power of Prior Trauma and Narrative Reappraisal in Sustaining Entrepreneurial Endeavors\n\nFocus: Explore the correlation between living through prior trauma, having the language to articulate it, and sustaining entrepreneurial endeavors. Highlight the importance of reappraisal and narrative in fostering entrepreneurial self-efficacy, agency, resilience, and persistence.\n\nKey points:\n- Discuss the findings that prior trauma and the ability to articulate it were the only factors correlating with sustained entrepreneurial endeavors.\n- Analyze how the close mental proximity of prior experiences and derived lessons contribute to resilience and the belief in emerging stronger from adversity.\n- Emphasize the role of reappraisal and narrative in shaping entrepreneurs' mindsets and coping strategies.\n\nRationale: This paper establishes the foundation of your research by presenting the core findings and their implications for understanding entrepreneurial resilience. It sets the stage for the second paper, which builds upon these insights to propose practical interventions.\n\nPaper 2: Cultivating Resilience through Humor and Social Support: Strategies for Transforming Today's Difficulties into \"Another One of Those\"\n\nFocus: Propose and explore methods to create an environment that helps entrepreneurs transform current challenges into growth opportunities, drawing from the insights of the first paper. Highlight the role of humor and social support networks, such as cohort-based learning groups and daily check-ins, in promoting resilience.\n\nKey points:\n- Briefly recap the findings from the first paper, emphasizing the importance of reappraisal and narrative in fostering resilience.\n- Introduce the concept of transforming current difficulties into \"another one of those\" experiences that contribute to growth and learning.\n- Propose and discuss the use of humor and social support networks as strategies to create an environment conducive to resilience and growth.\n- Present the idea of daily check-ins at work, school, or home, offering sample questions (like those attached) to facilitate reappraisal and narrative formation.\n- Encourage the adoption of these practices and suggest avenues for further research and implementation.\n\nRationale: This paper builds upon the insights from the first paper, translating them into actionable strategies and interventions. By proposing humor and social support as key elements in fostering resilience, you extend the impact of your research and provide practical tools for entrepreneurs and educators.\n\nBy writing two papers, you can first establish the theoretical foundation and then build upon it to offer practical applications. This approach allows for a more in-depth exploration of each aspect while maintaining a clear connection between the two papers. It also increases the potential for your research to make a significant contribution to both the academic understanding of entrepreneurial resilience and the development of effective interventions to support entrepreneurs in navigating challenges.",

We highlight the role of humor and social support networks, such as cohort-based learning groups and daily check-ins, in promoting resilience. Drawing from a mixed-methods study, we present a set of practical strategies and interventions, including sample questions for daily check-ins, that facilitate reappraisal and narrative formation.

Drawing from a large-scale, longitudinal study and qualitative case studies, we propose a dynamic model that illustrates the interrelationships among these components and their contribution to sustained entrepreneurial success. We discuss the implications of this meta-theory for entrepreneurs, educators, and policymakers, highlighting the potential for targeted interventions and support systems. Our findings provide a new framework for understanding the complex process of resilience-building in entrepreneurship and offer guidance for future research and practice.\n\nBy presenting these three papers as a cohesive series, you can demonstrate the progression of your research from foundational insights to practical interventions and, finally, to a comprehensive theoretical framework.
