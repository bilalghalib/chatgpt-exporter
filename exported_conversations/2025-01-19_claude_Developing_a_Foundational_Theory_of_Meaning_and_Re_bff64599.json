      "content": "Let's answer question 1 and 4 first in depth before moving on. First I think you have enough information about how we've attempted to do that to achieve point one about articulating the progression from APs to recognition. It was first recognized that Joe appeared to be circling around an idea about recognition that is \"behind the scenes\" just behind awareness, this idea that, as he describes in values preferences and meaningful choice, when someone attempts to explain their use of an AP and asked why it is \"wiser\" - they might say: \"First, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\"\n\nFrom here we can conclude that the person is experiencing something that appears to be external to their experience, that they are recognizing something rather than discovering it - even though joe uses the language of discovering and \"reasons\" rather than a felt sense of meaning and a reversing of attention upon itself to identify where it's gazing. I don't think we are necessarily rationally thinking I love being xyz in this situation vs enjoying a meaningful moment and then reviewing and wondering what it was about it that was so lovely. This has many implications in the idea of the importance of discovery, exploration, experience, presence and conscious direction of attention (not to mention the tragedy of the impact the attention economy has on our sense of meaning) \nFrom here and before this point I'm sure we've written and shared enough with you by now (focus on my writing and insights) to answer this question with rigor and substance. What questions are left? You have two of Joe's papers and his FAQ from his website to review for his description of his theory, and me to refine ideas with if need be with more questions. For now let's give answering it a shot and add questions later if needed\n\npoint two from question one: viewing values as APs is beautiful, it shows us what matters about a moment to us. It doesn't tell us why it matters. The teleological point is lost, it's just slightly better and seems to cohesively be leading us somewhere, yet where are we being led, what is the moral arc of the universe going to, why is it possible that people can recognize the wisdom behind other people's reasonings on a moral graph? Our perspective is that the reason is that this is showing you the role you are uniquely fit to play in the world, at this time, with your skills, penchants, inherent qualities, family upbringing, place in the world, the million forces at play that shape you into who you currently are can be struck like a bell and the trillion frequencies give way to the one that resonates most - sort of like an Impulse Excitation in a glass gives way to the glass intoning what makes it what it is. Our attention is like the glass coming to awareness of itself vibrating and it tells us something important about us. Although it might be more apt to describe it as a series of bottles stuck in the mud with varying sizes and filled to different levels as we have many ways of being. Or maybe a tree with branches howling different frequencies (although howling doesn't sound so great ;D) - what is singing, the tree or the wind? or the relationship. The idea that we take on \"policies\" doesn't make a lot of sense for me, why would we take them on, for what? and then there's the idea that Joe mentions that that we're seeking benefits (that seems instrumental, sort of counter to the point that Joe is making about CAPs being ends in and of themselves) so to fix these issues I think we need attention to be non-volitional and described in retrospect. To beauty all things submit to willingly, beauty is compelling in a subtle way that we can then return to a moment where we were struck by beauty and ask ourselves - what foundational thing does this show me about myself. Of course it's an interplay, with world, and self and wind and all these things, this is why we must be where we are, we cannot design a list of policies for a moment, we can have lists of inspiraitonal moments in the past, and lists of ways of being we find inspiring in role models, and then once we are in the arena where we hope to bring to bear our values we must attend to which of all these things is most accessible in this moment (aliveness, resonance) - this way our discovery phase can result in APs described as what we were \"forced\" to attend to by the fact of our very make up - we can tell what moments we should \"mine\" for APs that can become provisional policies for certain contexts. Yet we should beware not to suggest that this \"IS\" the way I \"want\" to be in the future for that context and that an LLM has some understanding of how to offer for us suggested behaviors even if they were mined from our own meaningful past, this is un-delegatable. The past is not the present in that we have changed, our bottles might have shifted, the levels might be changed, the wind might come softer or from a different angle striking different bottles. The \"complete\" person is able to have this happen in their awareness, the idea of witnesser and witnessed becoming one, like the hadith qudsi about \"God becoming the eye with which they see...\" - and for those they may have more latitude in meaningful actions - yet for the majority we can establish contexts, presenece and containers and a deck of CAP options and ask people, what feels like the most beautiful thing. That perception of beauty is like singing in the dark with a choir trying to find a harmonious chord, we can sort of squiggle around in the world of possible meaning to identify the right thing. While this describes the CAP side when we identify them and live them, we must also recognize that most people are not intentionally blocking caps with instrumental goals, norms and preferences. Things that \"don't matter\" and are attending to \"Self\" more often than not, even when we attend to \"others\" we are wondering \"what do they think of me\" These APs are more of a narrow range of view \"how can I x y or z so that a b or c...\" seeking and scanning and hoping for security by taking and hoarding and worrying and a sense of \"closedness\" - while a connection to a moment which allows for CAPs are often related with a sense of expansion, flow, love, and presence / witnessing. \n\n1. I think you have a lot of information to answer this. although I do think we made a graph that was pretty nice for how it connects with edelman and adult development theory.

Natural Recognition versus Conditioned Responses\n\nThe distinction between natural recognition and conditioned responses lies in their phenomenological and functional characteristics. Natural recognition exhibits several key features:\n\na) Emergent Properties:\n- Recognition emerges spontaneously rather than through effort\n- Attention moves naturally rather than being directed\n- The experience includes a sense of discovery rather than confirmation\n\nb) Wholeness Indicators:\n- Benefits and implications continue to unfold\n- Understanding deepens with reflection\n- Connections to other meaningful patterns become apparent\n\nIn contrast, conditioned responses show:\n- Fixed patterns of benefit/reward\n- Diminishing returns with repetition\n- Isolated rather than interconnected effects\n\nThe key diagnostic tool becomes examining the quality of attention itself: does it flow naturally or require maintenance? Does understanding deepen or become routine?\n\n2. True Resonance versus Emotional Attachment\n\nTrue resonance can be distinguished from emotional attachment through several key characteristics:\n\na) Directionality:\n- Resonance expands awareness beyond self\n- Emotional attachment contracts attention toward self-referential concerns\n- Recognition leads to natural action rather than compulsive reaction\n\nb) Temporal Quality:\n- Resonance creates enduring shifts in understanding\n- Emotional attachment creates temporary state changes\n- Recognition patterns remain accessible even when not actively engaged\n\nc) Integration Effects:\n- Resonance integrates different aspects of experience\n- Emotional attachment often fragments experience\n- Recognition allows holding complexity without confusion\n\n3. Authentic Meaning versus Social Conditioning\n\nThe relationship between authentic meaning and social conditioning requires careful examination:\n\na) Source Characteristics:\n- Authentic meaning emerges from direct recognition\n- Social conditioning operates through external validation\n- True recognition can occur within but transcend social contexts\n\nb) Development Patterns:\n- Authentic meaning deepens with examination\n- Social conditioning weakens under scrutiny\n- Recognition patterns show consistency across contexts\n\nThe Relationship Between Individual and Collective Development\n\n1. Individual Capacity for Recognition\n\nIndividual capacity for recognition develops through:\n\na) Practice Elements:\n- Creating conditions for presence\n- Reducing blocks to recognition\n- Developing sensitivity to resonance\n\nb) Growth Patterns:\n- Increasing subtlety of recognition\n- Broader range of contexts where recognition occurs\n- Greater fluidity between recognition and action\n\n2. Collective Wisdom Development\n\nCollective wisdom emerges through:\n\na) Shared Recognition:\n- Individual recognitions contributing to collective understanding\n- Patterns of meaning that transcend individual perspective\n- Development of shared languages for meaning\n\nb) Integration Mechanisms:\n- How individual insights become collective wisdom\n- Role of cultural transmission in wisdom development\n- Relationship between individual and collective growth\n\n3. Cultural/Contextual Influences\n\nThe interplay of culture and recognition involves:\n\na) Enabling Conditions:\n- Cultural practices that support recognition\n- Contexts that allow meaning to emerge\n- Environmental factors affecting recognition\n\nb) Constraining Factors:\n- Cultural blocks to recognition\n- Contextual limitations on meaning\n- Social patterns that inhibit wisdom development\n\n[I would include figures here showing:\n1. The phenomenological differences between recognition and conditioning\n2. The development pattern of individual recognition capacity\n3. The relationship between individual and collective wisdom development\n\nWould you like me to create these diagrams?]\n\nRemaining Questions:\n\n1. What is the precise mechanism by which recognition patterns become describable as attentional policies?\n2.

This shift has profound implications for how we understand personal growth, suggesting that development involves creating conditions for recognition rather than implementing better policies.\n\nOur framework integrates insights from multiple traditions – from contemporary work on attention and choice to wisdom traditions that have long understood the heart's capacity for recognition. By bringing these perspectives together, we offer both a theoretical understanding of how meaning emerges and practical approaches for working with tensions and barriers to recognition.

      "content": "i like the idea of impulse offering all frequencies and then the object telling you its own, it has the idea that everyone can be impulsed by a context and situation and sort of understand your CAPs and how you think is wise to respond - the idea of the witnesser or oneness or god (let's keep it all secular, ok?) might have all possibilities presented and we have specific ways that are unique to us and the context. What I'm struggling with is adding context to the metephor, maybe we are \"reeds\" pushed to different lengths, or the context can be different pools of water that fill the bottom of our reeds so when the reed system (of varying sizes and lengths) experiences drought and the bottom is lower then we sing a lower more sorrowful tone. haha, any other ways to do this metephor, i think context is important and is present in Joe's model and we need a way to integrate that to show that different contexts can have different CAPs afford wise ways of action that \"everyone\" can agree on - and our framework demonstrates why, because there is One \"source of meaning\" that expresses through different contexts (including your mind, soul, heart, body, environment, relationships, etc) and the \"right\" thing to do can be understood by anyone because they have access to that one wind that creates their ability to pay attention, just like the Rubber Hand illusion that messes with the sense of self, when we watch a movie or read a story, or listen to a friend recount an experience we can take on their \"context\" and \"see\" with our heart why their response made sense. \nWhen I met my wife and gave her a hug, my shoulders dropped, I felt ease and peace and something deep inside me \"said\" yes - it was on the second day I met her and I struggled to stay true to that feeling for years because my culture taught me to value my brain and lust and desire and \"wants(known as the enemy of hawa)\" we hear \"do what you want, you're an adult!\" and the issue is that want is connected to other parts of my self - and although it can be connected to the heart, to \"want what god wants\" - which makes sense once we've experienced a life of meaning - it isn't always or often connected to the heart - which is what might be a good way to represent that set of reeds in our chest, either the heart or the \"soul\" and the heart is a channel connecting to the divine spirit which can blow through it if it's turned towards it and pufied and the soul is the unique youness. EIther way the experience is that it's like a panflute or something, haha, that when it's purified and unclogged it can sing the tones -the Specific Good, specific source of meaning activated in that context - in that moment of breeze coming from the spirit (the All Good - the total source of all sources of possible meaning, all the infinite names possible to show in any possible circumstance) so without working to clear the heart we can be blocked (IAPs, or even CAP/CAP stuckness and confusion) - for me I was makign lists of all the reasons to be with someone and definitly IAP-ing my \"who should I marry\" - for my parents to be happy with me, to see me marry a \"Muslim girl\" - norm, social perception, external - or because my heart said yes. How can I trust my heart and recognize it as a source of valid and reliable information.

While we may understand and believe that the Qur’an and Sunnah provide all of the guidance we need in life, many do not realize just how much is contained within this deen. With all of the influence of global trends toward secularism and the predominantly secular societies we live in, it can be easy to be persuaded by the assumption of a binary between religion and science. The institution of academia has fought hard to convince the world that the social sciences are in fact sciences rather than philosophical paradigms rooted in epistemology. In turn, the Muslim ummah has collectively bought into this story and forgotten its rich tradition of ‘ilm an-nafs (knowledge of the soul).\n\nWhen you read about personal and professional development from just about any perspective or approach, the concepts and ideas are rooted in psychology. Modern psychology and its offshoots of personal development and self-help trends offer a lot of pertinent ideas and resources that all people, including the Muslim community, need desperately as societies become increasingly globalized and disconnected from the ancient wisdom that was inherent in more traditional, local communities and holistic lifestyles. But what these strands of pop psychology also bring with them are foundational assumptions about human nature, some of which are not aligned with the values and principles of an Islamic paradigm, which are baked into the cake. Without realizing it and/or without being fully aware of the repercussions of such philosophical and paradigmatic differences we can open ourselves up to hidden, often unintentional misguidance that can lead to a spiritual crisis, or worse, distance from our inner connection to Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He).\n\n'There exists within the Islamic tradition an entire “science” of the soul or self which is completely aligned with and based upon the Qur’an and Sunnah and which offers practical solutions to everyday struggles faced by people in the modern world.' @RothmanAbdallah\nClick to Tweet\nWhile this could be seen as a dilemma of whether to benefit from the good that these personal development resources have to offer and balance the potential pitfalls that they may present the Muslim trying to walk the path of Islam, fortunately, such a dilemma is unnecessary. There exists within the Islamic tradition an entire “science” of the soul or self which is completely aligned with and based upon the Qur’an and Sunnah and which offers practical solutions to everyday struggles faced by people in the modern world. In fact, this science of the soul is so advanced and comprehensive that it stands to offer entirely new insights to the popular field of self-improvement that even non-Muslims can benefit from. This is the legacy of the turath al Islam (path of Islam) as exemplified by our Beloved Prophet, peace be upon him, and is the birthright and heritage of every Muslim. Unfortunately, this knowledge has been all but lost and forgotten in the collective consciousness of today’s ummah. In this article, we want to share a glimpse of this turath and its impact on modern life and self-help.\n\nThe inherent psychology within Islam\nOur perspective of Islam can often be one dimensional, especially if we have not done our own deep exploration of the teachings within the context of traditional Islamic spiritual education (tarbiyyah). As many followers of a religion, whether accepting that of their parents’ beliefs and rituals or individually choosing to follow the path set out by religious teachings, there is a tendency to see religion as a set of prescriptions that one must follow in order to be in God’s good graces. Religion has become institutionalized to the point that we make edifices out of the religion as a thing in and of itself, rather than understanding it as a path of guidance to follow in order to grow developmentally as a human being. What this can amount to is a relationship to the religion that is more transactional than it is transformational. We do what we have understood we are supposed to do with a belief that certain behaviors and actions or inactions will result in us being in God’s good grace, without necessarily transforming the state of our being or doing any work from the inside out. However, the Qur’an is replete with messages of the need for personal transformation and accountability within our innermost selves, as it says:\n\n“[…] Allah does not change a people until they change what is in themselves” (Qur’an 13: 11)\n\nWhat does it mean to change what is in oneself, what does that amount to, and how does one do this? These are all questions that could be assumed to be confined within the domain of the field of psychology, and yet the answers are all detailed within the Islamic tradition. What we have come to know as the academic discipline of psychology, a word which literally means the study of the soul, was not traditionally conceptualized as such in Islamic teachings because the study of the soul is embedded within the content of the entire Qur’an and Sunnah. The knowledge of the soul and its development is spread throughout the many branches of knowledge within the Islamic tradition, as there was previously no distinction or separation between the following of the religion and the individual effort to work on oneself in the process of inner transformation. We have become disconnected from the inherently holistic worldview which Islam posits and have adopted a disaggregated way of thinking about life and ourselves to the point that it is now necessary to present the Islamic knowledge of the soul in a condensed form that lends parity to that of modern psychology. Thus while our predecessors may not have needed to use terms such as “psychology” to distinguish such endeavors from other parts of the deen, it now becomes imperative for us to understand and define “Islamic psychology”.\n\n'What does it mean to change what is in oneself, what does that amount to, and how does one do this? These are all questions that could be assumed to be confined within the domain of the field of psychology, and yet the answers are all detailed within the Islamic tradition.' @RothmanAbdallah\nClick to Tweet\nAn Islamic perspective of the self\nUnlike popular conceptions within modern psychology and the dominant discourse of self-help and self-improvement which identifies the notion of the self as being centralized in the mind and in thought, an Islamic perspective of self includes multiple aspects of the whole being. Cartesian philosophy, which posits the notion of “I think therefore I am” has pervaded contemporary thought to the extent that most conceptions regarding the self within popular psychology are framed around the mind as the central location of human identity. We see this represented graphically in just about any poster or textbook that references psychology being accompanied by a picture of the brain, and by the name of the clinical field being termed “Mental Health”.\n\n\n\nOften we see this brain or mind pictured in isolation, seemingly severed from the rest of its body, as similarly there is a tendency to see the body only as a housing for the mind as the core identity of the person. An Islamic perspective, conversely, necessarily posits that the human is a whole, integrated spiritual being which includes the body, mind, heart, and spirit.\n\n'An Islamic perspective, conversely, necessarily posits that the human is a whole, integrated spiritual being which includes the body, mind, heart, and spirit.' @RothmanAbdallah\nClick to Tweet\nBased on the writings and teachings of our learned scholars who have maintained an unbroken chain of transmission in how to interpret the Qur’an and understand the Prophetic tradition, we learn that within the Islamic ontological paradigm the true identity of a person is their soul, which is one integrated spiritual being, including the body. Thus an important distinction in Islamic psychology is that the central identity of the person is the soul, rather than the more narrowly defined notion of the self which is primarily conceived of as the construction of identity-based on personality and memories, which are confined to the temporal world, or dunya. A fundamental aspect of the Islamic conception of the soul is that the starting point in the soul’s journey is not limited to the moment of birth, but includes pre-existence. This goes back to the point of origin of all of the souls when they were created and Allah asked them “Am I not your Lord?” (Qur’an 7: 172). As the Qur’an narrates every single soul that will ever be created was there in that moment and replied: “Indeed we witness” (Qur’an 7: 172).\n\n“And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam – from their loins – their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes, we witness.” [This] – lest you should say on the day of Resurrection, “Indeed, we were of this unaware.” (Qur’an 7: 172)\n\nThis critical moment in the trajectory of every human soul distinguishes the human identity as a soul that is in a state of witnessing that Allah is One and that they (each human being) are servants of the Lord. In other words, it is within our true nature to be dependent on the One God for subsistence and to recognize that Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) is in control of everything, a very different picture than the self that is in control of its own destiny as many popular narratives go in the self-help industry.\n\nFitrah: The soul’s true identity\nThe soul’s trajectory becomes a challenge or a test the minute they enter into the dunya in human form as that innate witnessing of their true nature becomes veiled to them, thus beginning the journey back to this witnessing. As Islam narrates, at the end of the temporary state of human life in the dunya all souls will again be made aware of Allah’s omnipotence as the veil is lifted from us, but what each soul has done in terms of their striving to uncover that witnessing in the time they had in the dunya will determine their relative state in the next life. Thus, an Islamic paradigm of psychology is not limited to this life, as contemporary psychology is, but rather includes both pre-natal and post mortem realities. The concept of fitrah, the innate natural disposition of the human being as this soul from its point of origin as a witness of tawhid (Oneness of God) is crucial to a conception of psychology from an Islamic worldview as it fundamentally defines both the picture of healthy functioning and a mechanism for understanding unhealthy functioning. Thus the definition of what we call mental health and wellbeing is connected to the spiritual state of the person, not just their relative level of comfort or happiness in the dunya.\n\nThe optimal state of the person then is to be in alignment with fitrah and to uncover that true nature of witnessing which is constantly being veiled and challenged by multiple factors within this life. When we are in a state of submission to the will of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) we are in our optimal state of functioning and aligned with our fitrah. However, this is a difficult state to maintain as we have several factors impacting our ability to be in the state of remembrance of that true nature which is necessary to maintain optimal functioning. In addition to the external factors in the dunya that distract us from the remembrance of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He), there is a constant struggle inside of us that we must engage in that amounts to a battleground in our soul. In order to be better equipped for the battle, it is important that we understand the terrain of the soul and how to navigate it.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe structure of the soul\nThe soul in its pure state, before being covered and veiled from Allah’s reality, has the spark of the Divine breath that was breathed into us, known as the ruh. The ruh, or spirit, is the pure aspect of the human soul that is always there and which cannot be corrupted or misaligned. It is this pure and good aspect of our soul that allows us to always come back to the witnessing of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and provides the human being with a direct connection to Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He). While the ruh cannot be corrupted it most certainly can get covered over to the point that we are unaware and disconnected from this part of our soul. When we came into this world our souls were manifested in a physical form, in our bodies, in which we have the nafs, or lower self- the part of us that is bound to our temporal existence here in the world. This is the same self that most of the contemporary psychology deals with exclusively and is what we tend to be most familiar with, as it is how we experience ourselves in the world. This is the part of our self that likes what it likes, has desires and sways us in one direction or another. While it is not bad in and of itself, it has a tendency to lead us away from our fitrah and into a state of ghafla, or forgetfulness of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He), because it is the part of ourselves that is oriented to the dunya and lives purely in this realm.\n\nThe ruh and the nafs can be conceived of as being two opposite poles of which we are constantly being pulled between in the battleground of our soul. We are spiritual beings having physical experiences here in this life and we are pulled between identifying and living in this seemingly separate reality where we are in control of our actions, through our free will, and our innate nature of knowing that we come from Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and are dependent on Him for everything. The struggle between these two poles is essentially the manifestation of the paradox of experiencing duality in the temporal world while possessing an innate sense of the reality of Oneness (tawhid). Our work here in this life, and therefore our work in our personal and professional development, is to stay engaged in this struggle to constantly strive toward the remembrance of our fitrah to unlock or uncover our true potential as servants of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and the akhira as our end, rather than servants of our nafs and the dunya as our end. The central crux of where this battle takes place and what determines our relative outcome is located in the qalb, or heart, which, in an Islamic paradigm, is the center of the self/soul.\n\nThe word qalb in Arabic is a linguistic root that indicates turning one way or another. The word taqalab means “to turn”. So the function of the heart is that it can turn, either toward the ruh, or toward the nafs. The extent to which we are consciously able to turn our hearts toward the ruh and thus toward Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) is determined by several factors that cloud, block or impede our ability to do so. When we have unresolved emotional trauma from our experiences in life, whether real or perceived, it can manifest as blocks in our heart that further veil us from being able to witness Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and turn to our higher nature. What we would normally conceive of as psychological imbalances are therefore not only cognitive but can be traced down deeper into our hearts, our qalb, where certain experiences have essential knocked us out of alignment with our fitrah and put our system out of balance. In addition to these internal manifestations of forces that pull us away from witnessing Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and submitting to His tawhid, we also have external factors that are inherent in the dunya reality which distract us and pull us toward our nafs, or lower self, when we are in a state of an-nafs al amarah, or the soul that incites to evil. But here the evil can simply be the evil of forgetting our true nature and being subsumed in the illusion of individuation or self-direction.\n\nSelf-development as the development of the soul\nThe work of self-improvement or personal development is the work of constantly staying engaged in the effort to uncover the blocks on the heart, essentially cleaning the heart, and striving and struggling to stay in remembrance of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) amidst the distractions and downward pulls of the dunya. One aspect of the structure of our souls that can help us in this struggle is the aql, which can be conceived of as the cognitive function, but which is a more Divinely connected kind of reasoning. In the Islamic model of the soul, the aql is not understood as the central driving aspect of the self but is actually better understood as a function of the qalb. In addition to the normal kind of logical reasoning that we attribute to the mind, the qalb has the ability to perceive and to see things as they are. The form of the word aql that is used in the Qur’an is an active verb y’aqiluna and it is used as a descriptor of a function of the qalb, so that the heart has the ability to perceive. It is in using this ability to perceive that the qalb possesses that we can effectively turn our hearts away from the veils of the dunya which result in a state of ghafla, and turn it toward Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and the akhira, accessing through the point of Divine connection within us, the ruh.\n\nWe experience different qualities or characteristics of our soul depending on our relative position in the battleground of our soul. When we are subsumed by the covering on our heart and are in a state of an-nafs al ammarah, we can manifest character qualities that are destructive, such as anger, jealousy, and envy; these are called the muhlikat, or destroyers. And when we are engaged in the struggle of the jihad an-nafs (struggle of the self), attempting to reign in our lower tendencies toward individuation and self-direction, we are in a state of an-nafs al lawwamah, or the self-reproaching soul, where we take ourselves to account and make an effort to doing the work of turning our hearts. This can involve a process of thadhib al akhlaq, or the refinement of character, where through self-awareness we consciously try to change the muhlikat and attempt to emulate good character traits such as courage and wisdom and justice, called munjiyat, or saviors and were exemplified in the perfected character of the Prophet subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He). These manifestations of muhlikat, or negative character, are signs of where we need to do the work on ourselves in our process of personal development with the goal of aligning with fitrah and evolving to our higher self, or the next best version of our self. When we have moments of success in this process we can experience the soul in a state of peace, which is the an-nafs al mutma’inah, or the soul at rest. While it is rare to fully achieve this state, we can get glimpses of it that keeps us motivated to do the work of striving toward that next best version, having more frequent experiences of the state of the soul in an-nafs al mutma’inah. This is the goal of personal development in an Islamic paradigm and there exists within the Islamic tradition a whole host of tools and guidance in the pursuit of the purification of the heart and soul.\n\nAn Islamic model of the soul\n\n\nClick to download the full-sized image\nThe Islamic model of the soul presented here was developed as a result of the input of 18 scholars with expertise in various branches of knowledge within the Islamic tradition, the details of which are reported in Rothman and Coyle’s (2018) report of the research findings. According to this model, the human soul has an innately pure and good nature, fitrah, that comes from and is connected to God but that becomes covered over and forgotten as a natural part of life in the dunya. Throughout its life in the dunya, within the soul, there exists a dynamic interplay of conflicting forces that affect the psychological state of the person and determine relative levels of alignment or misalignment with fitrah (this process is represented by the purple elements in the middle of the model).\n\nThe qalb, which is the spiritual center of the person, and where the faculty of intellect is located as the aql, has the potential to turn in either of two directions which shapes the relative, transient outcome of this conflict. It can turn toward the lower impulses of the nafs and become further misaligned with fitrah by the influences of the dunya and shaytan (satan), resulting in increased negative characteristics of the muhlikat and a state of ghafla, (this process is represented by the red elements toward the bottom half of the model). Or it can turn toward the higher, Godly nature of the ruh with the remembrance of Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) and the akhirah (afterlife), resulting in increased positive characteristics of the munjiyat, and come more in alignment with the soul’s state of fitrah (this process is represented by the blue elements toward the top half of the model).\n\nThe relative state of the soul in relation to either of these two poles at any one time is articulated in three distinct stages of the soul’s development throughout life in the dunya, namely: an-nafs al ammarah bil su’, an-nafs al lawwama, and an-nafs al mutma’inah. The model posits that the soul has an inherent inclination toward growth and an upward trajectory in relation to this model, due to its primordial nature of knowing God, and that the Islamic tradition, as guided by the Qur’an and Sunnah, encourages and maps out a path for the human being to pursue this trajectory. This is demonstrated in the description of processes along the path that act as mechanisms for exerting effort in the dynamic interplay within the soul as it struggles between the two opposing forces, namely; jihad an-nafs, tahdhib al-akhlaq, and tazkiyat an-nafs.\n\nImplications for Personal and Professional Development\nIf we locate our identity within our soul rather than just our self, or the persona that we project in our life, we have the opportunity to take personal transformation to a whole new level. Breaking through the barriers and limitations of our mind and mental worlds is often a critical and necessary step in unlocking our potential and getting to that next best version of our self. However, there are still limitations to our growth if we only conceive of and interact with the cognitive aspect. As the Islamic model posits, the cognitive aspect is one part of a whole, and by recognizing and opening to a more holistic vision of the self, that of the soul, we can access our deeper inner reality and grow in a more profound way.\n\nBy adopting an approach to personal development that is informed and guided by the Islamic model of the soul, we have an opportunity to unlock the secrets of the meaning of life and integrate our religious belief system and worldview with our daily life struggle. In fact, this is the necessary pathway to both deepening our understanding of and relationship to Islam and truly advancing our psychospiritual development. This involves not only reorienting our approach to the deen of Islam to be that of a path of self-development but reorienting our notion of self to be one that is centered in the heart.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad ṣallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam (peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him) said, “there is a piece of flesh in the body and when it is sound the whole body is sound and when it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt and indeed that is the heart”[Sahih Al-Bukhari]\n\nWhile this certainly has implications for physical health and the physical organ of the heart, our learned scholars teach us that the main intention in this statement was in explaining the nature of our spiritual heart as the center of the human being. The Qur’an tells us that our hearts have the ability to reason and perceive and it is only when the heart is polished that a person can truly see things “as they are”. And yet we rarely operate from a place that is centered in the heart in our orientation to our life in the dunya. We suffer from the nature of the plight of the human being in this life which is that we perceive ourselves as self-directed, individual units who are in control of our own destiny.\n\nHow can we possibly work toward achievement and productivity in our lives if we believe that we are not in control? This is the fundamental dilemma that philosophers and critics of religion have debated, and is the same paradox that many Muslims often do not find satisfactory answers to. How do we balance our free will and self-determination with a belief in qadr (destiny)? Self-help guidance often says that we need to have an internal locus of control in order to master our self and take control of our personal development. And yet deeply embedded within the Islamic paradigm and the worldview of a Muslim is that we have an external locus of control, that Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) is the One who is ultimately in control of our outcome. The secret to success in this endeavor of development as a Muslim is to embrace both of these realities, rather than choosing one, it is to embrace the paradox, by which we can witness tawhid (Oneness of Allah)."

Later theorists give more weight to the importance of psychological narrowing in addition to broadening when building personal resources. Narrowing is typically associated with negative emotions, but their adverse effects can be counterbalanced by positive emotions. Therefore, the beneficial aspects of narrowing can be experienced without harmful effects if both positive and negative emotions are experienced in proportion.\n\t4\tThe creative process is often studied in relation to this, as it involves a widening of the mind, building of personal resources, and both sides of the emotional spectrum.\n\t5\tA 2005 study found that naturally creative people experience wider mood swings, spending a lot of time in both positive and negative emotional spaces depending on what they are trying to accomplish at the time. Too much time on either side can be detrimental: excessive positive emotions without an appropriate counterbalance can make people aloof and unfocused.[5]\n\t6\tThe creative process is often discussed in two stages: defocused attention, followed by focused attention.\n\t7\tDefocused attention occurs when a person is able to see a wide range of possibilities and take in as much information as possible. Focused attention takes place when more negative emotions are felt and causes people to analyze the possibilities they found during defocused attention. Without this process, concrete ideas do not form.\n\t8\tThe whole-brain hypothesis of creativity also promotes the importance of psychological narrowing. The theory states that the defocused stage uses a greater portion of the right side of the brain, whereas the focused process uses more of the left side. Creativity necessitates communication between the two hemispheres to form coherent theories and develop personal skills.[5]\n\t9\t“\n\t10\tyou can find that in our prior context, you can give the explanatory power your best shot\n\t11\tpractical applications can be in coaching, in transforming business Human Resources departments to working on creating aliveness \n"

Context and Recognition Capacity\n\nWhen someone encounters genuine meaning, they describe being \"taken\" by it rather than choosing it. Like a reed that vibrates with specific frequencies based on its length and the water that partially fills it, we each have unique capacities for recognizing meaning in different contexts. This capacity isn't fixed but dynamically interacts with our environment, history, and current state – our context includes not just external circumstances but our own readiness for recognition.\n\nThis dynamic relationship between context and capacity suggests something profound about meaning: we don't just observe it, we participate in its emergence. Just as different depths of water change which frequencies a reed can resonate with, our context – including our physical state, relationships, environment, and even our concepts and language – shapes what meaning we're capable of recognizing. The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, where noticing one instance of something suddenly reveals it everywhere, demonstrates how developing new \"handles\" or affordances for recognition can transform our entire experience of meaning.\n\nWould you like me to continue with:\n1. The dynamics of turning toward/away rhythm\n2. Practical implications\n3. Academic framework integration\n\nI'll pause here for your input before continuing, to ensure this section captures your vision accurately.

Context and Recognition Capacity\n\nWhen someone encounters genuine meaning, they describe being \"taken\" by it rather than choosing it. Like a reed that vibrates with specific frequencies based on its length and the water that partially fills it, we each have unique capacities for recognizing meaning in different contexts. This capacity isn't fixed but dynamically interacts with our environment, history, and current state – our context includes not just external circumstances but our own readiness for recognition.\n\nThis dynamic relationship between context and capacity suggests something profound about meaning: we don't just observe it, we participate in its emergence. Just as different depths of water change which frequencies a reed can resonate with, our context – including our physical state, relationships, environment, and even our concepts and language – shapes what meaning we're capable of recognizing. The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, where noticing one instance of something suddenly reveals it everywhere, demonstrates how developing new \"handles\" or affordances for recognition can transform our entire experience of meaning.\n\nWould you like me to continue with:\n1. The dynamics of turning toward/away rhythm\n2. Practical implications\n3. Academic framework integration\n\nI'll pause here for your input before continuing, to ensure this section captures your vision accurately. Does this convey the relationship between context and capacity as you understand it?",

Will focus on the natural rhythm Bilal described between recognition and response.</antThinking>\n\nB. The Natural Rhythm of Recognition\n\nThis capacity for recognition operates through a natural rhythm of turning toward and away from meaning, similar to the creative process which requires both defocused and focused attention. Fredrickson's broaden-and-build theory helps illuminate this dynamic: just as positive emotions broaden awareness while building resources, recognition involves both an opening to meaning and a turning away to embody it.\n\nIn moments of opening, attention naturally broadens like a lens widening its aperture. This isn't a technique we implement but a natural response when the heart turns toward recognition. Like a mirror facing another mirror, creating infinite reflections, these moments can generate what feels like endless discovery of meaning and implication. This explains why, when asked about meaningful choices, people often sense they've \"only just begun discovering\" what makes them significant.\n\nThe turning away is equally important – not a disconnection from meaning but a movement toward embodiment. Like the creative process which requires focused attention to analyze possibilities discovered during defocused states, we must turn from pure recognition toward practical response. This rhythm creates a kind of \"heartbeat\" of meaning: recognition followed by response, witnessing followed by embodiment, being taken by beauty followed by enacting it.\n\nC. Practical Development of Recognition\n\nThe practical implications of this framework suggest a different approach to personal development. Rather than implementing better policies, growth involves:\n\n1. Creating conditions that support recognition:\n- Developing practices that connect us with nature and beauty\n- Building trust in heart-based recognition\n- Cultivating environments that enable presence\n\n2. Working with attention:\n- Learning to recognize the difference between instrumental focus and natural responsiveness\n- Developing comfort with both broad and narrow attention\n- Using instrumental attention patterns (IAPs) to create contexts for meaningful recognition\n\n3.

      "content": " <antThinking>Let me organize this rich input into a methodological framework, focusing on the practical distinction between CAP/CAP and CAP/IAP tensions, and the experiential aspects of role model engagement and creative grappling.</antThinking>\n\nIII. Methodology (Initial Draft)\n\nA. Working with Tensions\n\nThe methodology begins by distinguishing between two fundamentally different types of tension. CAP/IAP tensions – conflicts between meaningful and instrumental patterns – invite investigation of the instrumental pattern's origin and necessity. Here, the work involves asking:\n- Why does this instrumental pattern exist?\n- Does it truly need to exist?\n- Can it be connected to deeper meaning or simply released?\n\nCAP/CAP tensions – conflicts between different meaningful patterns – require a different approach. Rather than elimination or integration, these tensions invite creative discovery of more encompassing meaning. Like a development toward greater unity, CAP/CAP tensions point toward what wants to emerge that might honor both patterns in a new way.\n\nB. Role Model Engagement\n\nThe approach to role models leverages our natural capacity for perspective-taking and embodied simulation – similar to the rubber hand illusion where our sense of self can extend beyond our usual boundaries. By deeply engaging with a role model's context and character, we can:\n- Experience their way of being from the inside\n- Recognize possibilities within ourselves\n- Identify conditions that might evoke similar qualities\n\nThis isn't about imitation but about recognizing shared capacities for meaning.\n\n[Would you like me to continue with:\n1. Creative Grappling methodology\n2. Documentation approach\n3. Integration of methods\n\nOr would you prefer to refine these sections first?]\n\nKey methodological insight: We're not teaching new policies but helping people recognize and work with meaning that's already trying to emerge. The LLM assists primarily with documentation, allowing people to focus on recognition rather than analysis.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Develop any of these sections further?\n2. Add specific examples?\n3. Move to the next section?",

            "text": " <antThinking>Let me organize this rich input into a methodological framework, focusing on the practical distinction between CAP/CAP and CAP/IAP tensions, and the experiential aspects of role model engagement and creative grappling.</antThinking>\n\nIII. Methodology (Initial Draft)\n\nA. Working with Tensions\n\nThe methodology begins by distinguishing between two fundamentally different types of tension. CAP/IAP tensions – conflicts between meaningful and instrumental patterns – invite investigation of the instrumental pattern's origin and necessity. Here, the work involves asking:\n- Why does this instrumental pattern exist?\n- Does it truly need to exist?\n- Can it be connected to deeper meaning or simply released?\n\nCAP/CAP tensions – conflicts between different meaningful patterns – require a different approach. Rather than elimination or integration, these tensions invite creative discovery of more encompassing meaning. Like a development toward greater unity, CAP/CAP tensions point toward what wants to emerge that might honor both patterns in a new way.\n\nB. Role Model Engagement\n\nThe approach to role models leverages our natural capacity for perspective-taking and embodied simulation – similar to the rubber hand illusion where our sense of self can extend beyond our usual boundaries. By deeply engaging with a role model's context and character, we can:\n- Experience their way of being from the inside\n- Recognize possibilities within ourselves\n- Identify conditions that might evoke similar qualities\n\nThis isn't about imitation but about recognizing shared capacities for meaning.\n\n[Would you like me to continue with:\n1. Creative Grappling methodology\n2. Documentation approach\n3. Integration of methods\n\nOr would you prefer to refine these sections first?]\n\nKey methodological insight: We're not teaching new policies but helping people recognize and work with meaning that's already trying to emerge. The LLM assists primarily with documentation, allowing people to focus on recognition rather than analysis.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Develop any of these sections further?\n2. Add specific examples?\n3. Move to the next section?",

      "content": " Let me propose three different analogies and then ask questions to help refine them:\n\n1. Prism Analogy:\nPure white light (infinite possibility of meaning/good) passes through a prism (your unique configuration/context). The resulting spectrum shows exactly which frequencies your particular structure can refract and reveal. Your attention naturally moves to certain colors - this reveals your unique capacity for recognizing specific aspects of meaning. The prism can be clearer or more clouded, affecting its ability to separate and reveal these colors.\n\n2. Musical Instrument Analog:\nLike a complex instrument (think pipe organ or sitar), you have multiple resonant chambers/strings that can respond to vibration. When exposed to a rich sound, only certain harmonics will be activated based on your specific construction. Your attention is drawn to these natural resonances - they reveal your unique capacity for meaning. The instrument can be well-tuned or out of tune, affecting its ability to respond cleanly.\n\n3. Crystallization Analogy:\nLike a supersaturated solution exposed to a seed crystal, meaning crystallizes in patterns unique to your structure. The same universal potential for crystallization (meaning) manifests differently based on your specific lattice structure. Your attention is naturally drawn to these emerging patterns - they reveal your unique way of recognizing meaning. The solution can be pure or contaminated, affecting crystallization clarity.\n\nQuestions to refine these:\n\n1. What aspects of recognition do these analogies miss?\n- The role of active turning toward/away?\n- The development/growth aspect?\n- The social/contextual dimension?\n\n2. Which aspects feel most accurate?\n- The passive receiving vs active engaging dynamic?\n- The structural uniqueness determining response?\n- The clarity/purity affecting recognition?\n\n3. What key elements need better representation?\n- The relationship between witness and witnessed?\n- The role of attention in recognition?\n- The development of capacity over time?\n\n4. Are there elements of your original analogies that these miss?\n- The multiplicity of possible responses?\n- The relationship between context and capacity?\n- The dynamic nature of recognition?\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Refine one of these analogies?\n2. Combine elements from different ones?\n3. Explore a completely different direction?\n\nThe goal is to find an analogy that's both rigorous and intuitive, capturing both the universal nature of meaning and our unique capacities for recognizing it.",

Like a master musician who can hear and appreciate all the subtle harmonics in another's playing, development allows you to recognize more qualities of meaning, both in your own life and others'.

Living Lens Analogy:\nImagine a living lens that can actively turn toward light and develop new facets. Unlike a static prism, this lens:\n- Can actively turn toward what draws it\n- Develops new surfaces for capturing different qualities of light\n- Can temporarily adopt the configuration of other lenses to see what they see\n- Maintains its unique way of focusing while expanding its range\nThe clarity of the lens affects what it can receive, but it's always developing new capacities for recognition.\n\n3.

How does the role of context relate to finger positions?\n\nOf these, I'm drawn to the Aeolian Harp variation because:\n- Wind/breath maintains the spiritual connotation\n- Multiple strings suggest multiple ways of expressing meaning\n- Active adjustment shows role of context\n- Development can be shown through new strings/refinement\n- The sound is beautiful rather than discordant\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Refine the Aeolian Harp metaphor?\n2. Explore aspects of the others?\n3. Try something completely different?\n\nI think we're getting closer to a metaphor that captures both the universal source and individual expression while maintaining beauty and clarity.",

Theoretical Framework\n\nA. Recognition and Development\n\nWhen someone describes a meaningful moment, they often speak of being \"taken\" by it rather than choosing it. Like being struck by a beautiful piece of music, meaning seems to resonate with something fundamental in us before we consciously recognize it. This suggests a different understanding of how meaning operates: rather than implementing policies we choose, we discover patterns we naturally resonate with.\n\nEach person has what we might call a fundamental tone - a core way of recognizing and responding to meaning. Just as every physical object has natural frequencies at which it most easily vibrates, we each have natural patterns of recognition that reflect our unique configuration of capacities, history, and context. The heart acts as a resonating chamber that can receive the full spectrum of possibility but expresses through specific \"notes\" based on both inherent capacity and current conditions.\n\nThis understanding helps explain several puzzling aspects of meaningful experience:\n\n1. The Paradox of Recognition\nWhen asked why certain patterns feel meaningful, people often describe \"only beginning to discover\" their significance. Like how a trained musician can hear a fundamental tone even when it's physically absent, we can recognize patterns of meaning even before we fully understand them. This explains why meaningful moments often feel both deeply personal and somehow universal - we're recognizing something that resonates with our fundamental pattern while pointing toward larger harmonies.\n\n2. Development of Capacity\nDevelopment isn't just about adding new patterns (like learning new policies) but involves several interrelated processes:\n- Clarifying our fundamental tone by removing interference\n- Developing new harmonics that build on our basic pattern\n- Improving our resonance by creating supportive conditions\n- Integrating seemingly conflicting patterns into larger harmonies\n\n3. The Role of Attention\nAttention operates like a musician's ear, becoming more refined through practice:\n- Learning to distinguish between fundamental patterns and surface noise\n- Recognizing harmonics in seemingly separate experiences\n- Developing sensitivity to subtle patterns of meaning\n- Maintaining awareness of both detail and overall harmony\n\nThis explains why meaningful patterns can't simply be implemented as policies - they must be recognized through a kind of listening that develops over time. Like musical training that develops the ability to hear subtle harmonics, our capacity for recognition grows through practice, experience, and careful attention to patterns of meaning as they naturally emerge.\n\n[Would you like me to continue with the next sections:\n1.

Context and Capacity\n\nThe relationship between context and our capacity for recognition is both subtle and dynamic.

Working with Tensions\n\nTensions in our attention patterns often signal opportunities for deeper recognition.

Types of Tension\n\na) CAP/IAP Tensions:\nThese tensions arise between meaningful patterns and instrumental ones. Like a musician who becomes so focused on technical exercises they lose touch with the music itself, instrumental patterns can block our natural resonance with meaning. Working with these tensions involves:\n- Investigating why the instrumental pattern exists\n- Whether it truly serves a necessary function\n- If it can be transformed through connection to meaning\n- When it might simply be released\n\nFor example, someone might adopt a \"people-pleasing\" pattern (IAP) that blocks their natural resonance with authentic expression. The work isn't to simply eliminate the pattern but to understand:\n- What valid need it serves (e.g., safety, belonging)\n- Whether that need could be met through meaningful patterns\n- How to develop new capacities that serve both safety and authenticity\n\nb) CAP/CAP Tensions:\nThese are more complex, like hearing two beautiful but seemingly incompatible melodies. The work isn't to choose between them but to discover or develop the deeper harmony that might incorporate both. This often requires:\n- Creative exploration of new possibilities\n- Development of new capacities\n- Discovery of more encompassing patterns of meaning\n\nFor example, tensions between caring for others and authentic self-expression might reveal a more fundamental pattern about how genuine presence serves both self and other.\n\n2. Working with Tension as Development\n\nThe process of working with tensions follows natural patterns:\n\na) Recognition Phase:\n- Noticing where attention feels pulled in different directions\n- Distinguishing between instrumental and meaningful patterns\n- Identifying what's being blocked or suppressed\n- Recognizing signs of potential meaning trying to emerge\n\nb) Exploration Phase:\n- Creating space to hear subtle patterns\n- Experimenting with different ways of holding the tension\n- Allowing new possibilities to emerge\n- Paying attention to what naturally draws attention\n\nc) Integration Phase:\n- Discovering deeper patterns that resolve apparent conflicts\n- Developing new capacities that honor multiple values\n- Creating conditions that support new ways of being\n- Documenting and reinforcing new patterns of meaning\n\n3.

Methodology\n\nThe methodology for developing recognition capacity draws from both traditional wisdom about meaning and contemporary understanding of how attention and development work. Rather than implementing predetermined policies, this approach focuses on creating conditions where recognition can naturally emerge and develop.\n\nWorking with Tensions\n\nTensions in attention patterns serve as primary indicators for where development is possible. These tensions manifest in two distinct forms, each requiring different methodological approaches. The first type, conflicts between meaningful and instrumental patterns (CAP/IAP tensions), often signals where natural recognition is being blocked by conditioned responses or protective patterns. Working with these tensions involves careful investigation of the instrumental pattern's origin and necessity, followed by either transformation or release. For example, when someone discovers their \"efficient\" work patterns actually block deeper engagement, the work isn't simply to eliminate efficiency but to discover how authentic engagement might serve both meaning and effectiveness.\n\nThe second type, tensions between different meaningful patterns (CAP/CAP tensions), presents more subtle challenges. These tensions, like apparent conflicts between creative expression and responsible action, often point toward potential integration at a deeper level. The methodology here involves creating conditions where new patterns can emerge naturally, rather than forcing artificial resolution. This process mirrors artistic creation, requiring both receptivity to new possibilities and active engagement with emerging patterns.\n\nRole Models and Past Experience\n\nThe approach to role models leverages our capacity for perspective-taking and embodied simulation. Just as the rubber hand illusion demonstrates how our sense of self can extend beyond usual boundaries, deep engagement with role models allows us to recognize new possibilities within ourselves. This isn't mere imitation but a form of recognition development - by temporarily \"inhabiting\" another's way of being, we discover potential patterns of meaning we might not otherwise notice. The process involves full engagement with their context and way of being, followed by careful attention to what naturally resonates with our own fundamental patterns.\n\nSimilarly, past meaningful experiences serve as crucial reference points for development. By carefully examining moments where meaning was clearly present, we can identify both our natural patterns of recognition and the conditions that support them. This retrospective analysis reveals recurring themes and patterns that might otherwise remain implicit, allowing for more conscious development of capacity.\n\nCreative Grappling\n\nThe creative engagement with meaning follows natural patterns of development similar to artistic creation. This process requires alternating between broad exploration and focused development, between opening to new possibilities and crafting specific expressions. Like the creative process which requires both defocused attention to discover possibilities and focused attention to develop them, working with meaning involves a natural rhythm of receptivity and response.\n\nThis approach acknowledges that development isn't linear but emerges through cycles of exploration, integration, and refinement. By creating conditions that support natural recognition while maintaining awareness of emerging patterns, practitioners can develop increasingly sophisticated capacity for engaging with meaning. The process respects both individual differences in fundamental patterns and universal aspects of how meaning emerges and develops.\n\nDocumentation and Integration\n\nRather than trying to capture every aspect of meaningful experience, documentation focuses on tracking patterns of recognition and development over time. This involves noting not just what draws attention but how recognition occurs, what conditions support it, and how capacity develops. The emphasis isn't on creating exhaustive records but on supporting ongoing development by identifying patterns and tracking growth.\n\nThe documentation process itself should maintain contact with meaning rather than becoming mechanical. Like a musician's practice journal, it serves to support development while remaining secondary to direct engagement with meaning. This might include noting recurring patterns, tracking changes in capacity, and identifying conditions that support or hinder recognition.\n\nThis methodological framework suggests a fundamentally different approach to personal development - one based on recognizing and working with natural patterns of meaning rather than implementing predetermined policies.

Methodology: From Recognition to Development\n\nThe development of recognition capacity follows a natural cycle (Figure 1), moving between creating conditions, allowing recognition to emerge, documenting patterns, and developing new capacities. This cycle isn't merely sequential but dynamic, with tensions arising throughout that invite creative engagement and development.\n\nA. Recognition Development\n\nThe foundation of this methodology lies in understanding how recognition naturally emerges and develops. Like an instrument that must be properly tuned and placed in appropriate acoustic conditions, recognition requires both internal preparation and supportive external conditions.\n\nInitial Conditions:\nCreating conditions for recognition involves three key elements:\n\n1. Physical Presence Practices\nThe body serves as our first instrument of recognition. Regular practices that develop embodied presence create the foundation for reliable recognition. These might include:\n- Breath awareness practices\n- Movement patterns that support presence\n- Regular pauses for physical \"tuning\"\n\n2. Environmental Cultivation\nJust as musicians carefully choose their performance spaces, practitioners must attend to their environment. This includes:\n- Creating physical spaces that support presence\n- Managing digital and social environments\n- Establishing rhythms that allow for recognition\n\n3. Attention Development\nRecognition requires refined attention.

Methodology: From Recognition to Development\n\nThe development of recognition capacity follows a natural cycle (Figure 1), moving between creating conditions, allowing recognition to emerge, documenting patterns, and developing new capacities. This cycle isn't merely sequential but dynamic, with tensions arising throughout that invite creative engagement and development.\n\nA. Recognition Development\n\nThe foundation of this methodology lies in understanding how recognition naturally emerges and develops. Like an instrument that must be properly tuned and placed in appropriate acoustic conditions, recognition requires both internal preparation and supportive external conditions.\n\nInitial Conditions:\nCreating conditions for recognition involves three key elements:\n\n1. Physical Presence Practices\nThe body serves as our first instrument of recognition. Regular practices that develop embodied presence create the foundation for reliable recognition. These might include:\n- Breath awareness practices\n- Movement patterns that support presence\n- Regular pauses for physical \"tuning\"\n\n2. Environmental Cultivation\nJust as musicians carefully choose their performance spaces, practitioners must attend to their environment. This includes:\n- Creating physical spaces that support presence\n- Managing digital and social environments\n- Establishing rhythms that allow for recognition\n\n3. Attention Development\nRecognition requires refined attention. This development includes:\n- Learning to distinguish between different qualities of attention\n- Developing capacity for sustained presence\n- Building sensitivity to subtle patterns of meaning\n\nB. Working with Tensions\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, tensions emerge in two distinct forms, each requiring different methodological approaches. Understanding how to work with these tensions forms a central part of the methodology.\n\nCAP/IAP Tensions:\nWhen instrumental patterns conflict with meaningful engagement, the methodology follows a clear progression:\n\n1.

Integration or Release Work\nBased on the investigation, practitioners work to either:\n- Transform instrumental patterns through connection to meaning\n- Gradually release patterns that no longer serve\n- Develop new capacities that honor both practical needs and meaningful engagement\n\n[Would you like me to continue with the next sections:\n1.

Researchers can make people feel sensation in a rubber hand simply by synchronizing touches to it with touches to their real hand, hidden from view. Within minutes, participants begin experiencing the rubber hand as part of their body. This simple experiment reveals something profound: our sense of self isn't fixed but can extend beyond our usual boundaries through resonance with patterns we recognize.\n\nThis capacity for recognition through resonance may be key to understanding how meaning actually works in human life. Just as we can recognize a rubber hand as \"ours\" through synchronized patterns, we seem to recognize meaning through a kind of resonance with patterns that already exist within us. Like an instrument that vibrates with certain frequencies based on its construction, we each have natural ways of resonating with meaning.\n\nCurrent approaches to values and meaning often miss this fundamental quality. Recent work by Edelman (2021) has made significant progress in understanding values as \"constitutive attentional policies\" - patterns of what we pay attention to when making meaningful choices. His framework moves beyond viewing values as abstract principles or revealed preferences.

His framework provides a crucial advance over traditional approaches that view values as abstract principles or revealed preferences. By focusing on attention patterns, Edelman helps us understand values as lived patterns rather than theoretical constructs. Yet when people describe why certain patterns feel meaningful, they often speak as if discovering something rather than choosing it, describing \"diffuse, unconnected reasons\" and sensing they've \"only just begun discovering the benefits.\" This suggests something more fundamental is at work than policy implementation.\n\nConsider how meaning actually emerges in experience: we don't choose what to find meaningful; rather, meaning chooses us through our natural capacity for recognition. Like how different bottles filled to varying levels will each resonate with particular frequencies when the wind blows across them, we find ourselves naturally attuned to specific patterns of meaning. What we call values might better be understood as descriptions of how our attention moves when this recognition occurs.\n\n[FIGURE 3: Recognition Development]\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Natural Capacity] --> B[Recognition Patterns]\n    B --> C[Attention Movement]\n    C --> D[Development]\n    D --> A\n    E[Context] -.-> B\n    F[Blocks] -.-> B\n```\n\nThis framework suggests a fundamentally different approach to personal development - one based on creating conditions where recognition can naturally emerge while maintaining practical engagement with life's challenges. By understanding how meaning emerges through recognition rather than implementation, we can work more effectively with both individual development and collective wisdom.\n\nThe implications of this shift are profound. Instead of trying to choose and implement better policies, we might focus on:\n- Creating conditions that support natural recognition\n- Working with rather than against tensions that arise\n- Developing capacity for more subtle recognition\n- Understanding how meaning naturally emerges and develops\n\nThis paper presents an integrated framework for understanding and working with meaning through the lens of recognition.

Just as an instrument's capacity emerges through the interplay of its construction, the contexts it encounters, and how it's played, our ability to recognize meaning develops through a dynamic interaction between our fundamental nature, the situations we encounter, and how we engage with life. This isn't a linear process of implementing better policies but an organic unfolding of latent capacity through recognition, integration, and refinement.\n\n[FIGURE 9: Natural Development Cycle - as shown above]\n\n1. Natural Development Patterns\n\nThe initial emergence of recognition capacity often appears spontaneous, like how a new instrument first reveals its true voice in unexpected moments. These moments of clear recognition can arrive suddenly - a piece of music that takes our breath away, a moment of connection that opens our heart, an insight that transforms our understanding. Yet the development of this capacity follows discernible patterns that, while not linear or mechanical, show clear progression through distinct phases.\n\nThe first phase involves what we might call recognition emergence. Like an instrument first discovering its fundamental tone, we begin to notice particular patterns of meaning that naturally draw our attention. These aren't chosen but recognized, often with a sense of \"ah, this is what I've been looking for.\" This initial recognition creates a foundation for development, establishing basic patterns of resonance that can be refined and expanded over time.\n\nAs these patterns clarify, we develop increasingly subtle discrimination - like how a musician's ear becomes more refined through practice and exposure. This isn't just about recognizing more patterns but about developing deeper understanding of how meaning emerges in different contexts. The heart learns to distinguish between fundamental patterns and surface variations, between authentic resonance and conditioned responses, between what naturally draws attention and what demands it.\n\n2. Development Mechanisms\n\nThe actual mechanisms through which recognition capacity develops operate through three primary pathways, each contributing distinctly to the overall development of capacity:\n\nDirect Recognition arises from immediate encounter with meaning, like how an instrument might discover new possibilities through actually being played. This involves more than just having experiences - it requires a kind of presence and openness that allows natural recognition to occur. When we're present to what naturally draws our attention, new patterns of meaning can emerge spontaneously, revealing capacities we didn't know we had. This direct recognition forms the foundation for all other development, providing the raw material from which more refined capacity emerges.\n\nPattern Integration involves the systematic development of recognition capacity through experience and reflection. Like how a musician builds their repertoire not just by playing but by deeply engaging with music, we develop our capacity for recognition through active engagement with meaningful patterns. This includes learning from role models - not through imitation but through recognizing similar capacities within ourselves. It also involves learning from our own experience, noticing recurring patterns and developing increasingly subtle understanding of how meaning emerges in different contexts.\n\n3. Creative Development\n\nThe third pathway involves what we might call creative development - the capacity to discover new patterns of meaning through active engagement with life's challenges. This isn't about implementing new policies but about allowing new patterns to emerge through creative engagement with tension and possibility. Like how a musician might discover new ways of playing through experimental exploration, we can develop new recognition capacities through creative engagement with life's situations.\n\nThis creative development is particularly important when working with tensions between different patterns of meaning. Rather than choosing between patterns or trying to balance them, creative development allows new, more encompassing patterns to emerge. This often involves a period of uncertainty or apparent conflict, followed by the discovery of new ways of seeing that integrate previously competing patterns.\n\n[Would you like me to continue with:\n1.

CAP/CAP Tensions: The Creative Edge\n\nWhen two meaningful patterns seem to conflict, we encounter a different order of tension - like hearing two beautiful but apparently incompatible melodies. This isn't the discord of instrumental versus meaningful patterns but the creative tension of different aspects of meaning seeking integration. Understanding these tensions requires a fundamental shift in perspective: rather than seeing them as problems to solve, we recognize them as invitations to discover deeper patterns of meaning.\n\nThe Nature of CAP/CAP Tensions\n\nLike how musical harmony often emerges from initial dissonance, CAP/CAP tensions point toward potential integration at a deeper level.

CAP/CAP Tensions: The Creative Edge\n\nWhen two meaningful patterns seem to conflict, we encounter a different order of tension - like hearing two beautiful but apparently incompatible melodies. This isn't the discord of instrumental versus meaningful patterns but the creative tension of different aspects of meaning seeking integration. Understanding these tensions requires a fundamental shift in perspective: rather than seeing them as problems to solve, we recognize them as invitations to discover deeper patterns of meaning.\n\nThe Nature of CAP/CAP Tensions\n\nLike how musical harmony often emerges from initial dissonance, CAP/CAP tensions point toward potential integration at a deeper level. This becomes clearer when we understand how these tensions actually operate. Just as every note in music contains harmonics that connect it to other notes, meaningful patterns often share underlying connections that aren't immediately apparent.\n\nConsider how this works with the fundamental frequency phenomenon: just as we can recognize a fundamental tone even when it's physically absent, we can sometimes sense a deeper pattern of meaning that connects apparently conflicting ways of being.

The Resonant Impact: From Personal Alignment to Collective Transformation\n\n[FIGURE 23: Impact Ripples]\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Individual Recognition] --> B[Personal Aliveness]\n    B --> C[Relationship Quality]\n    C --> D[Organizational Vitality]\n    D --> E[Systemic Change]\n    F[Heart Recognition] -.-> G[Natural Response]\n    G -.-> H[Collective Wisdom]\n    H -.-> I[Cultural Evolution]\n```\n\nThe implications of this framework extend far beyond personal development. When we understand meaning as something that emerges through recognition rather than implementation, we begin to see why current approaches to both personal growth and social change often fall short. The fundamental insight is profound: transformation doesn't come through setting and achieving external goals but through allowing our natural capacity for meaning to emerge and express itself.\n\n1.

When people and organizations operate primarily through IAPs:\n- Resistance naturally emerges\n- Innovation becomes blocked\n- Resources get wasted\n- True coordination becomes impossible\n\n[FIGURE 31: Governance Evolution]\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Current Systems] --> B[Control Mechanisms]\n    C[Recognition Systems] --> D[Natural Coordination]\n    B --> E[Systemic Tension]\n    D --> F[Organic Development]\n    G[Collective Wisdom] -.-> H[Social Innovation]\n```\n\n9. International Relations and Global Coordination\n\nThe implications for international relations are particularly significant. Current approaches often attempt to:\n- Force cooperation through treaties\n- Drive change through external pressure\n- Manage conflict through power politics\n- Create unity through standardization\n\nA recognition-based approach suggests:\n- Cooperation emerging through shared recognition\n- Change flowing from enhanced capacity\n- Conflict transformation through deeper understanding\n- Unity emerging through authentic engagement\n\nThis has practical implications for:\n\nGlobal Challenges:\n- Environmental coordination\n- Economic development\n- Cultural exchange\n- Conflict resolution\n\n[Would you like me to continue with:\n1.

They kind of Indicate what our life is for. If you would For instance, you know, somebody In just the right place, at just the right time, doing just the right thing, or just the right people is likely to feel a lot of aliveness, bringing all of their gifts to bear. Their gifts of their own life, their skills, their knowledge, all the things that they've developed over time then when you realize like, wow, I've done all of this just for this one moment. How special is this moment? And I think that realization is a moment of great aliveness. And I think that's one of the things that is possible to see and difficult to develop, but this ability to see how this moment is perfect and in perfect aliveness, for you, if you can unite your perspectives and see How all of your skills, your pensions, your natural inclinations, are wanting to show up in this moment and connect with all of you. And all of you might be needing some rest. So I think there's like this idea of, importantly, night and day as well. And so in aliveness, we're talking about moments of meaning and attention. Being able to see, and that's really daytime activities. Right? Attending to these different policies, in a moment of meaning. And then there are certainly times of receiving receiving rest receiving rejuvenation, And they could be meaningful moments too, but they might not necessarily have that feeling of that heightened state of aliveness, and this is just right. Right? Like, there's 2 different kinds of this is just right. There's at the end of the day, sitting on the couch, with the beloved and eating a delicious snack after a day of aliveness and contribution and connection and letting it all go being present, and enjoying that moment of quote unquote well deserved rest. Right? And you can get this sort of well deserved rest when It's really clear that you have had that moments of meaning in your day. You've had that thing that made your day feel complete. You've actually taken that 1% and after you've done your accounting and you've looked at. You know, ways that you've upheld your values and potentially ways that you might have let yourself down. You look back and you can say, that you're in the positive. You know? I thought this was a good day. And now you can let that go. And so it's a part of the aliveness to have some rest. Wondering if there's, like, what's the opposite of life is dead? But is there another duality that we can bring in here that isn't death? Right? Aliveness and alive restfulness. Or alive in action and a live receiving. Because it is actually something important for us to witness each other's aliveness. To Allow ourselves to be inspired by each other's ability to be a portal for a source of meaning into the world, seeing them sort of, like, shine with aliveness as that thing flows through them And To realize that that could be us, but to allow this witnessing to inspire us. Right? So maybe the opposite of you know, coming to life and in action, is The Work to develop the the stories of potentiality and inspiration. So it's aliveness and inspiration. I'm not really sure. Yeah. So aliveness and the Islamic concept of heart purification or remembrance I think there's this thing that is about the heart being a channel for the spirits the light that wants to enter through you and then refract into your soul and all these unique colors that are specific to you and the Aliveness is when there's purification enough to turn towards that and allow the color that wants to take place in this time right now to be the color that you take on and enact. Right? It's submitting to that and then being in the right place at the right time because of listening and responding to the call. Right? And remembrance is to know that we need to be attuning and attending to these signs and these symbols on the horizons and within ourselves and to put on the structured glasses of the signs in the Quran and in the Sunnah, to help us see how these messages are coming to know how to Apply them in a in a beautiful and perfect way. And it's sort of like stepping out a little bit and looking at all of the patterns around you. So it's like Other oriented, non self oriented and deciding, like, what needs to happen here that I can do. Right? And it could be that that that space can be filled in with a cluster. So for instance, you look out and you see this, like, tile work. And it's either an octagon or 8 triangles or or or something like that. Right? Like, a pentagon or 6 triangles. And so maybe you say, okay. I'll be this triangle because that's what I can do right now. I'm not a pentagon. And I need to find 6 other 5 other people to to come and fill this because that's the right thing here, and we should all be orange. Or something like that. You know you know what I mean? Development of a live ritual practical. I I First of all, it's knowing what makes you come alive by looking into your history. What makes you come alive in movies, What makes you come alive in art? And to gather that information and and use, I think, the attentional policies but realize that this is a recognition not a Derivation. It's not something that you're deciding to have an intentional This is a recognizing of what happens to your attention in this meaningful moment. And when you do that, you recognize it as coming from outside and other and that's really important for meaning. If meaning was all subjective, it's really easy to doubt. And doubt is a meaning killer. So having this beast, a recognition, puts people into a state of awe and wonder and humility and reverence and feeling the the the beauty of being chosen a lot of attention in divine names. I think we talked about that. And this framework supports both individual development and collective wisdom. Yeah. And so the question is, like, we can be start measuring in our organizations moments of aliveness or moments of meaning or something like that. And it's not about not measuring, it's about measuring the right things. Right? And we can retroactively measure goals but in the day before we set out for the day, we we, plan for moments of aliveness And then we just be sure that the right people are in the right places because their aliveness leads us to our objectives that are collectively alive.",

      "content": " I think that this experience of coming alive is meaningful in and of itself, and it's a place that we can abide in. And rest in. And and watch ourselves in acting things because sort of like the ikigai, like, we have the skills, we have the competencies, we have the interest, we have the the name that wants to flow through us. And it's sort of like a glass resonating with a with another glass close by, we see ourselves start to vibrate in the same thing. We're like, ah, yeah. Here he goes. You know? And rather than thinking of it as coming from us and exhausting us and depleting us, we see it as you know, like, if you've ever done, like, a long hold of a stretch and you find your body start Campbell. You can kind of just like let it It's not like you're moving your legs, but you're letting your legs be moved. Something like that. I don't know if you ever felt that kind of, like, tremble that you can just kind of amplify by just allowing and that feels very much like something that you do for its own sake. In this kinda gentle way. Right? It's, you see the beauty, you you allow it, you you encourage it, You give a little bit of I guess you can call it effort or something but that becomes this kind of thing that you can also witness and realize that it's a beautiful thing that is happening through you and from you and with you and with your participation And this is kind of the the tension between free will and predestination. Like, God is acting, but you are acting in the allowance and the submission of that tremble that wants to happen through you. It Yeah. Clearly articulated attention patterns is totally still possible. We don't need to not do that we just need to do it Leader. You know, we go back, and then we just need to help people contextualize those attentional patterns and I think simply just letting them know that or realize or recognize or feel that this is What their attention was naturally drawn to and it wasn't volitional, but they can notice it later. Sort of like, you know, like, I was taken aback. Ice, you know? And it doesn't always have to be this, like, amazing, magical moment. Right? Like, there are these quiet moments of of of meaning that we can look at and then notice where we were paying attention. And that's that I actually really prefer to be able to have it be clearly identified as attentional patterns. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So aliveness happens in context When you zoom out and you look at the patterns all around and you try to see what wants to happen in the space in between that you can fill or you and and friends can fill or something like that. That's the context. Right? That's the context. And it could be not always, quote unquote, what normally would people would recognize as beauty. Let's say that you're a judge, and the context is putting away a criminal to protect society. It might be a hard choice, but you might do it because it's the right and beautiful thing to do. For your context and where you are. Reproducibility and reliable development I think, is really important by connecting it to traditions that know how to do it. So the tsunami tradition in Tezquia. There's the Zen tradition. There's many traditions. I'd I'd love your help actually to come up with kind of a, you know, an image of this development and and how aliveness is, accessed in different traditions. Heightened emotional states versus alive Attention. So a lie of attention Also has this element of quality that we were determining. Right? So this a lot of attention was related to this idea of, recognition of a sense of things. Right? So the whole thing that Joe was talking about in terms of you know, you kind of get this feeling that you're just beginning to understand. That's because there's a moment of, like, just noticing a quality of a sense of a thing, and the thoughts begin and then the feelings can emerge But the first thing is just like this is noticing. You know? And heightened emotional states are could be you know, sure, there's emotions connected with aliveness, of course. And It isn't to disconnect the soul from the body, but to integrate them and to call them one collective thing that is comprised of different systems and parts that all cohesively make up a oneness. So, you know, like, sure, there's emotions connected, but is it that crazy to think that those emotions are created or are manifesting because of a witnessing of a supra rational faculty. Of recognition of quality. Right? Is is that crazy? I think that makes sense. Confirmation bias and recognition. I'm not sure how if you could help me derive that. Empirical validation of perfect moments I guess we can call them perfected or moments. I don't think we need to call them perfect moments. I think that is, out of our league, first of all. We're humans. And so but the idea of a meaningful moment having this qualitative sense of, like, yeah. This is right. Right? It's the best that we can do for right now, and what would you mean by empirical validation? I mean, sure, there's gonna be, like, some emotional stuff. There's gonna be some cognitive and and brain patterns that we can potentially identify and I just wanna include the reality of a faculty that we're not including in all of our psychological and neurological assessments, which is the thing that recognizes quality. It might be closer to when people are talking about embodiment and these other things because you're looking within your body for, sensation and understanding. And, yeah, there could be a place for it, but I think calling this thing a new faculty of recognizing quality is important because the body is usually focused on trauma work. And it might be interesting to, like, look into the body for other things as well. Body, mind, sense of holistic self, right, that connects all these things. Organizational perspective, accountability while prioritizing aliveness, I think it's it's that's that's kind of like the role of an aliveness oriented HR department. Right? And it's to ensure that person's aliveness is the right sort like, are are that come through them instead of coming up with a goal, asking the person, okay, let's say you wanna write a book. What ways of being make you an author. Rather than coming up with a goal, coming up with a word count, forcing yourself to reach this word count, It's more like a gardening approach where you still want to achieve the goal and you still have, you know, measures and you're tracking the health of the organism if you plant the right plants, and you water it with the right amount of water and you give it the right of fertilizer for that kind of plant, and you're expecting fruit, you can still expect the fruit but you have to get the right plant. Right? And so the, HR department and accountability is really on the selection. And of course, like people's aliveness can you can find aliveness that supports the type of activities and it's possible to find know, sometimes aliveness is just about knowledge, right, like, and skill. If you don't have the skill to be able to achieve and do something, you might find less aliveness in it then when you have the skill to be able to do it. Because then you feel like, wow. I was made for this. Like, I'm so glad I have these capacities, to be able to contribute in this way, and and they can be this, positive feedback loop. Structure and emergence, I think was in the gardening metaphor Risk of using aliveness to justify inefficiencies. We already talked about that. About also just tracking but like looking back at the end of the day instead of forward at the beginning of it and just you know, reconfiguring if needed inefficiencies integration of the existing systems. I'm not so sure. Okay. I think this is a good set of answers. How does it update things? Can you give me kind of a mind map of all of our thoughts and ideas that we have been updating ever since we first started writing the paper? Have we shifted anything drastically Are we still working on the same idea? Getting sometimes a little bit lost. I'm trying to figure out, like, what is that we're trying to say exactly? What are we circling around is the eye of the storm of this entire conversation? So map it all out in, like, a mind map and and some other graphs, and let's see if we can find the eye of the storm.",

And and watch ourselves in acting things because sort of like the ikigai, like, we have the skills, we have the competencies, we have the interest, we have the the name that wants to flow through us. And it's sort of like a glass resonating with a with another glass close by, we see ourselves start to vibrate in the same thing. We're like, ah, yeah. Here he goes. You know? And rather than thinking of it as coming from us and exhausting us and depleting us, we see it as you know, like, if you've ever done, like, a long hold of a stretch and you find your body start Campbell. You can kind of just like let it It's not like you're moving your legs, but you're letting your legs be moved. Something like that. I don't know if you ever felt that kind of, like, tremble that you can just kind of amplify by just allowing and that feels very much like something that you do for its own sake. In this kinda gentle way. Right? It's, you see the beauty, you you allow it, you you encourage it, You give a little bit of I guess you can call it effort or something but that becomes this kind of thing that you can also witness and realize that it's a beautiful thing that is happening through you and from you and with you and with your participation And this is kind of the the tension between free will and predestination. Like, God is acting, but you are acting in the allowance and the submission of that tremble that wants to happen through you. It Yeah. Clearly articulated attention patterns is totally still possible. We don't need to not do that we just need to do it Leader. You know, we go back, and then we just need to help people contextualize those attentional patterns and I think simply just letting them know that or realize or recognize or feel that this is What their attention was naturally drawn to and it wasn't volitional, but they can notice it later. Sort of like, you know, like, I was taken aback. Ice, you know? And it doesn't always have to be this, like, amazing, magical moment. Right? Like, there are these quiet moments of of of meaning that we can look at and then notice where we were paying attention. And that's that I actually really prefer to be able to have it be clearly identified as attentional patterns. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So aliveness happens in context When you zoom out and you look at the patterns all around and you try to see what wants to happen in the space in between that you can fill or you and and friends can fill or something like that. That's the context. Right? That's the context. And it could be not always, quote unquote, what normally would people would recognize as beauty. Let's say that you're a judge, and the context is putting away a criminal to protect society. It might be a hard choice, but you might do it because it's the right and beautiful thing to do. For your context and where you are. Reproducibility and reliable development I think, is really important by connecting it to traditions that know how to do it. So the tsunami tradition in Tezquia. There's the Zen tradition. There's many traditions. I'd I'd love your help actually to come up with kind of a, you know, an image of this development and and how aliveness is, accessed in different traditions. Heightened emotional states versus alive Attention. So a lie of attention Also has this element of quality that we were determining. Right? So this a lot of attention was related to this idea of, recognition of a sense of things. Right? So the whole thing that Joe was talking about in terms of you know, you kind of get this feeling that you're just beginning to understand. That's because there's a moment of, like, just noticing a quality of a sense of a thing, and the thoughts begin and then the feelings can emerge But the first thing is just like this is noticing. You know? And heightened emotional states are could be you know, sure, there's emotions connected with aliveness, of course. And It isn't to disconnect the soul from the body, but to integrate them and to call them one collective thing that is comprised of different systems and parts that all cohesively make up a oneness.

      "content": "Let's analyze the implication of these shifts and I also would like to see You know, I don't think calling it more fundamental than attempts to measure, manage, and direct attention It's it's another faculty. Right? And so a human being has a faculty of thinking and a faculty of contemplating and knowing and the faculties of feeling, and attention can be directed And we can watch the words in our mind, and we can watch the words on our mouths, but we're not really those words. This this, like, attention more connected to the witnesser. And so it asks the question of who are you? Right. If, we can change all of your thoughts and, you know, your feelings come and go, And And the stories can come and go as well. Being in presence completely Attending to your senses, Senses are another faculty. You'd even say that maybe emotions are type of sense. It's an introspective or proprioceptive know? These things combined together, And so I feel like the maybe it is a capacity as more fundamental because the perception of quality Knows somehow there's, like, an a knowing of the moments and capturing of the moment And it's sort of as a mirror to the outside. So maybe by attending into presence into all of your context your emotions, your proprioception, the field of view, the thoughts, passing through your mind at this moment, witnessing all of these things in in the moment right now So can say that that sort of creates the shape around which your this you you are. So the space all around you. Right? It's like the negative space interpretation of self. And when you look at that and you include proprioception and thoughts, What's left except for the witnesser and what it takes is act actively going through all of those things, you know, asking you can ask yourself, like, what are my emotions? Right now? What are my stories right now? What are my thoughts right now? What am I feeling in my body? What am I seeing outside? What am I in relationship with in terms of people, objects, Claude? And then you just do all of these things, and you look at all of those things And then there's the eye that is looking. Right? And there's a strong feeling for me of like a connection as well with the story of what we're doing. So even right now, the way I'm talking, there's this kind of turning away and turning towards like as I turned towards and I tried to see the thing that is seeing all of these things, I just want to be silent. Because the I and the I that is speaking are so Claude. It's like you're your breathing into the flute and you're trying to breathing, like, blowing into the flute Claude and you're trying to take a breath at the same time. It's impossible. Right? So this Right? And so when you want to breathe, in, what happens is you literally expand Lots of things change. Inside of your body And when you breathe out, you feel like a sense of relaxation. And when you breathe in, you feel a sense of, aliveness. And these actively modulate your heart. We know that for sure. And we're trying to say that the system is kind of like a oneness system. Some people Claude that the soul is just condensed into body. That all of you altogether is a part of the soul. And including this idea of an immaterial spirit and soul. And the thing is being in this state, of witnessing just pure witnessing, as Not conducive to enacting aliveness in the world, and I believe that we're here for more than just watching. And this inaction just needs to be in service of what witnessing finds beautiful. The song that wants to play in your life moment to moment And I don't know what this implies about attentional policies, right, So instead of a applying policies, to allowing responses, I think I don't think it's just that. I think it's something like Connecting to the quality of one of these plural nouns in a moment of meaning, and describing its quality. Right, and describing it. So for me, right now, I might be able to say moments of deep and honest soul searching reflection. Are some things that I find valuable. They're not bringing me to life jumping for joy, but as I explore these things, I know that I'm trying my best to touch ground truth something that is real",

And then you just do all of these things, and you look at all of those things And then there's the eye that is looking. Right? And there's a strong feeling for me of like a connection as well with the story of what we're doing. So even right now, the way I'm talking, there's this kind of turning away and turning towards like as I turned towards and I tried to see the thing that is seeing all of these things, I just want to be silent. Because the I and the I that is speaking are so Claude. It's like you're your breathing into the flute and you're trying to breathing, like, blowing into the flute Claude and you're trying to take a breath at the same time. It's impossible. Right? So this Right? And so when you want to breathe, in, what happens is you literally expand Lots of things change. Inside of your body And when you breathe out, you feel like a sense of relaxation. And when you breathe in, you feel a sense of, aliveness. And these actively modulate your heart. We know that for sure. And we're trying to say that the system is kind of like a oneness system. Some people Claude that the soul is just condensed into body. That all of you altogether is a part of the soul. And including this idea of an immaterial spirit and soul. And the thing is being in this state, of witnessing just pure witnessing, as Not conducive to enacting aliveness in the world, and I believe that we're here for more than just watching. And this inaction just needs to be in service of what witnessing finds beautiful. The song that wants to play in your life moment to moment And I don't know what this implies about attentional policies, right, So instead of a applying policies, to allowing responses, I think I don't think it's just that. I think it's something like Connecting to the quality of one of these plural nouns in a moment of meaning, and describing its quality. Right, and describing it. So for me, right now, I might be able to say moments of deep and honest soul searching reflection. Are some things that I find valuable. They're not bringing me to life jumping for joy, but as I explore these things, I know that I'm trying my best to touch ground truth something that is real",

So we have a a few things that happened with the enlightenment, a kind of disillusionment with religion as a source of meaning because of many wars, and a lack of unity. And this leads people to, look away from that and that gap opens up a space of Yeah. Meaning, gap. Alongside that we have these enlightenment processes. I think therefore I am the the only thing that exists is materiality from Galileo, describing, you know, if you if you knew the position and velocity of all particles in the world, you know all of the history and all of the future. This, beginning arrogant idea of, wow, like, science works to help understand, and we have a process of coming into agreement with each other about things. And not only that, but it is giving us power, and therefore, this power is good. And there might be another kind of similar thing that we could be doing these days. It's like a new science of a new scientific method of finding the things that are actually meaningful for us And when we can, align on that and unify around meaning, we are given, not control over our external environment, but maybe more Ability for contentedness and meaning things that power could never give us. Right? Let's say that we have infinite power and the logical conclusion is, instant transmogrification of everything in the universe according to our will. Right? Like, let's say that we could get down to the atomic scale and manipulate things, with infinite energy and power and we could time travel and we can go to the ends of the universe and we can shape it into machines that can think and feel and we can make sure that the entire universe is basically having you know, one massive orgasm at all times. Like, give them all, they basically make the whole universe conscious machines, like we're doing with AI and creating general intelligence. And then just making sure that you know, we're letting, energy flow, you know, from the foundational Principal components of matter, getting you know, atomic, energy, and into into the system, and we can split the world into, like, 2 parts. 1, which is going to be mind for energy from the the basic foundational building blocks of matter, and then the other is going to be, arranged in a way that it can perceive, benefit, right, or goodness or and, like, what's better than, like, one giant orgasm. Right? Just constant flood of the types of things that would make this, organism feel good. It's already achieved all of the goodness can in exploration and, like, our love of learning, let's say, it's very bounded to the earth. Right? It's like, here we are, we're trying to survive, and so exploring and learning, all of these things have these evolutionary adaptive principles, but once we have complete and under control of matter and energy, which is maybe the logical conclusion of our complete understanding of science and technical prowess, we only know the world through materiality, and the only good is living forever, which is possible now. We just make consciousness, mechanical and, put that into machines because it's possible to do that because the mind is just, you know, a machine that processes, sensory inputs and, wants to live forever and explore. And, that is, like, kind of the foundational thing of, like, why Elon Musk wants to go to Mars, and continue to colonize the world. And all of the, effective altruists are thinking about like, okay, well, how do we increase quality life hours because death is bad? And it's all sort of like this teleological conclusion of okay. Well, the best thing to do is to make sure that we don't have an extinction event. Death is bad. Extinction is bad. Life, and consciousness and reason is good. How can we know, make more reasonable decisions to ensure a life that continues beyond ours and hope hopefully our life itself, continues beyond ours. And so, I find all of that really problematic because it it doesn't get to the point. It doesn't get to the point because it's missing something fundamental, which is what if we were created for something? What if we were created Right. And created for something. And that our, world matters. The Earth matters. Our configuration as a human being matters. Our ability to perceive and the types of things that we can perceive and the way that we perceive matters. Our feelings of meaning really matters a lot. Right? And what if we we started really looking into that? And then and then we might come up with different conclusions. Right? Like, not living forever mattering, which is getting us out of the present moment where the only place of contentedness can possibly be but contentedness is so important, and you you're content when you're doing good work. Your content when you've when you've given your day iOS due. And you feel like pride in responding and being who you were meant to be And that feeling of, like, I know I'm missing something. I know there's more to life than this. Right? And how many billionaires have committed suicide when they've lost half of their fortunes? It's crazy. In in 2,000 and 9, I heard this story about a billionaire during the crash economic crash, who was, worth $2,000,000,000 and he lost 1,000,000,000 and he jumped off the penthouse suite, balcony in Manhattan. Right? How crazy is that? He's still a billionaire. He still has $1,000,000,000 Definitely successful, but I by all metrics. But comparison and this you know, Just shows, I really think that there's there's gotta be something else. It can't just be this. And and if we believe it is just, This sort of like material world and like subjective and everyone has their own ideas of what good is and instead of this this thought, like, wait a second, maybe there is a good that we can agree on and not have that problem that we've you know, looked at in the past with religions actually disconnecting people. Like what if religion was actually a does what the etymology of the word means, which is to bind together And religion and like a path to discovering a life of meaning, Right? What if that's what religions were? And I know it sounds crazy to talk about this as like a religious thing, but I really think that we we can talk about this as a binding together because we need something in this fractured world today where there's like the rise of the you know, Nazi party and fascists and all of these isms that are forming and, like, liberalism and the counter to liberalism, and conservatism, and These, like, effective altruists were hyper rationalists and like rationalism. Or whatever you wanna call this, effective altruism, and it's like, okay. Well, you all have Really beautiful things to share. But can we see the beauty in each other. Can we connect to the thing within us that is going to connect me To the thing within you. Because that thing is the source of meaning. All of it and it's 1 and it's beautiful and it's good, And everyone knows that. When they touch it. And there's others that might have be like pushed towards the self and have created an ism centered around that. And we can all sort of see that. And see that there are need rather than judge. And I feel like there's there's something here that's really important. And I want to find out what to do next with all of these ideas because I wanna move into a new window Can we just like write out as much information as possible. All the stories, all of the facts, all of the exploration, in, maybe 3 prompts, determine the, you know, title of each prompt and what it will contain, and then let's write them out 1 at a time, and you can begin with the first one and use the full context window that you're able to write in full sentences following our formats and go.",

But also I wanted you to do it in 2 parts. 1 is, like, I want you to gather everything that we have about and all the important elements that have been, shown up in this conversation from the beginning to the end. Especially things that are direct quotes from me and interesting observations and insights I've led to our realizations. And then also add to them to kind of, give a expanded view that I might not be seeing. For instance, you can help really explain the reality of what Galileo actually said and, you know, maybe other facts factors and, like, who the Luddites were and what their response was and what their philosophy was and what countering philosophies, were there and who the Habsburgs were and what there was what were their writing. That's stuff that I don't know. Right? So you can add a little bit to it. And then, like, control equals progress. Measurement equals understanding. Quantity determine determines quality. How do we know that belief is what they believed and you know, most people think of themselves as good. Like, where does Adam Smith fit into this? What about, like, Hume and other, you know, philosophers that kind of shaped western the western model of seeing the and thinking about the world and how it kind of leads to these results where people are feeling like alienated and why we build technology in the way that we do and why we have this, perspective of what the self is, and, you know, this individualist society, like where does this where does that foundation come from? And why would we have all this, like, narcissistic self internal reflection that causes us to you know, have a lot of these kind of neurosis and this fragility rather than this, like, who am I supposed to be? What is my vocation? What is my calling? And, like, why did the the idea of the vocation disappear? And so there's a lot of, like, ideas that I think we could be exploring here Claude the idea of, like, craft and then this idea of, like, having a master. Right? Of course, we have all this like bad taste about slavery, but having a teacher who you respect. And this idea of, like, respect as a virtue rather than as, like, you know, everybody please don't, you know, come come to work wearing whatever you want and, like, let's be, like, flexible and fluid and loose And I kind of feel like there's this power given to people that are not fully baked by technology, which is a part of what is feeding back on itself. Right? Like, we're literally giving kids, Mark Zuckerberg, world changing technology before he's fully myelinated and before he's had the ability to go from a socialized mind into a self transform self authoring mind into a self transforming mind, We need people that wield great power to to be further down that path. But technology and and this whole hacker kinda ethos is giving it to younger and younger people. Without this idea of, like, Knowledge, self respect, self mastery, that can be earned and learned through transmission of others whom we respect and we want to be like and be inspired by rather than being inspired by ourselves and our egos and dollars and scale and success and the clapping of civilization doesn't know what's good for itself because no, no, we don't. In the beginning. Right? We're young and we're developing. But we also, in our culture, not are not taught that there's such thing as People who do Know what a beautiful and good life is. This idea of like taking on a teacher and having our ourselves be educated and mastered and controlled and to use to to become a better flute for the the the breath of the of God. That wants to flow through us. But of course, not doing it in a way that's, like, negative. But, like, all of these ideas, that are connected, like tell me, like, how many different kinds of books I could be writing. Right? Like, I could write an academic book about quality and try to, like, argue that quality is a thing and that we can measure it and actually matters and we actually have scientific, backing for this, this way of this faculty. Right? And we can also, go the route of change the world by changing yourself, See the world. Let it impact how you feel, and then let's figure out what the right thing to do is and how, like, impact that comes from this grassroots inner development process is really important. And then there's idea of, like, attentional policies and meaning and this coaching process that we've been developing and how it relates to you know, asking yourselves, like, bringing more meaning into your day. And, of course, it touches with aliveness and, of course, there's probably a way of like, touching with this quality aspect. And there's also the bad economics. It's like what is an alternate economic system actually uplifts everyone? And what are the foundations of it in a practical way? It's like, okay. Well, what happens when interest is gone? What happens when we see, others a new light and the light of love and relationship rather than competition and transaction, you know. And you know, for me, I I I as someone whose brain is really interconnected, see them as all connected. But maybe you can give me some sound advice help me kind of structure my thinking and say, okay. Well, maybe this isn't one book. Or 5 books other books am I have we been talking about? Like, the history, the development of the the the way that of of seeing like, cosmologically and ontologically what the world is made of, and, like, missing some of these foundational elements like recognition and quality and the impact of that. Where did that come from? And, like, the the history of this philosophy And then there's the whole element of craft. And then there's the element of I don't want any of this to be like a polemic. I want this to be a conversation. About a different way of being that might be really beneficial that people can experiment with practically. Right? Like, ask themselves, like, do their daily accounting of moments of meaning and moments where they let themselves down and moments of doing. Right? And then see what happens when you try to navigate your life more and more along the lines of what brings meaning and whether or not you'll get the things that you are looking for. So like, looking at your wants and your needs and then serving beauty instead. And in doing that, are you getting your wants and needs met? And so instead of the icky guy and thinking about all of these things, like, is that possible to do it a different way? Is that another book? And like, maybe they're not books. Maybe some are workshops, and maybe some r applications on the phone, and maybe some are talks and maybe some should be PowerPoints I'm like really stuck looping with with you and I feel like I'm saying a lot of things and they're getting piled up in this conversation and they're stuck. And I I want to make sure that I find all the diamonds, right, and pull them out. So how many diamonds do we have that are actually insightful, unique, beautiful, to be cherished that we need to take out of this conversation and what are some good homes for them? And you can look into, like, PowerPoint slides and presentations and talks. I'm a facilitator. I have a a business doing entrepreneurship training. I love, to speak, I like writing, But I I need to I need your help to go from here to the next steps. So analyze what I just said and think about like a plan to make this, happen And maybe you can ask, show me what you are seeing, the I don't see. You know, tell me what I haven't been able to say and push back a little bit on all of this stuff and and show me potentially that maybe you know, this is only one book idea and here's what it is. And I can't believe you didn't see it like this and here's like the outline or maybe no, your mind is connecting too many different things. One will be able to follow you. Need to actually separate into these ways, and we should start with this element because it's the foundation and here's the catchy way of, saying it, the turn of phrase that's gonna get people to pay attention And here's all the things that you mentioned that are diamonds, that can't be lost, and that you need to preserve. And here's, like, terms of phrase so that you can memorize them and, like, encode them into your heart. So instead of this conversation being a discovery, you you've you've discovered. Now you need to Like, harvest and consume and become this conversation. So it's not like a discovery and a question and a processing. But this realization of something that we truly know. And yeah. Also, yeah. Let me know what you think about all this and and then how it connects with where we started and Joe's work and all of the exploration what are the diamonds? And how do I Harvest. And what should that harvest look like, and how can I share",

But maybe you can give me some sound advice help me kind of structure my thinking and say, okay. Well, maybe this isn't one book. Or 5 books other books am I have we been talking about? Like, the history, the development of the the the way that of of seeing like, cosmologically and ontologically what the world is made of, and, like, missing some of these foundational elements like recognition and quality and the impact of that. Where did that come from? And, like, the the history of this philosophy And then there's the whole element of craft. And then there's the element of I don't want any of this to be like a polemic. I want this to be a conversation. About a different way of being that might be really beneficial that people can experiment with practically. Right? Like, ask themselves, like, do their daily accounting of moments of meaning and moments where they let themselves down and moments of doing. Right? And then see what happens when you try to navigate your life more and more along the lines of what brings meaning and whether or not you'll get the things that you are looking for. So like, looking at your wants and your needs and then serving beauty instead. And in doing that, are you getting your wants and needs met? And so instead of the icky guy and thinking about all of these things, like, is that possible to do it a different way? Is that another book? And like, maybe they're not books. Maybe some are workshops, and maybe some r applications on the phone, and maybe some are talks and maybe some should be PowerPoints I'm like really stuck looping with with you and I feel like I'm saying a lot of things and they're getting piled up in this conversation and they're stuck. And I I want to make sure that I find all the diamonds, right, and pull them out. So how many diamonds do we have that are actually insightful, unique, beautiful, to be cherished that we need to take out of this conversation and what are some good homes for them? And you can look into, like, PowerPoint slides and presentations and talks. I'm a facilitator. I have a a business doing entrepreneurship training. I love, to speak, I like writing, But I I need to I need your help to go from here to the next steps. So analyze what I just said and think about like a plan to make this, happen And maybe you can ask, show me what you are seeing, the I don't see. You know, tell me what I haven't been able to say and push back a little bit on all of this stuff and and show me potentially that maybe you know, this is only one book idea and here's what it is. And I can't believe you didn't see it like this and here's like the outline or maybe no, your mind is connecting too many different things. One will be able to follow you. Need to actually separate into these ways, and we should start with this element because it's the foundation and here's the catchy way of, saying it, the turn of phrase that's gonna get people to pay attention And here's all the things that you mentioned that are diamonds, that can't be lost, and that you need to preserve. And here's, like, terms of phrase so that you can memorize them and, like, encode them into your heart. So instead of this conversation being a discovery, you you've you've discovered. Now you need to Like, harvest and consume and become this conversation. So it's not like a discovery and a question and a processing. But this realization of something that we truly know. And yeah. Also, yeah. Let me know what you think about all this and and then how it connects with where we started and Joe's work and all of the exploration what are the diamonds? And how do I Harvest. And what should that harvest look like, and how can I share",

I think more as a source of meaning and kind of fighting and defending it and maybe not even fighting and defending it. Just making it a normal part of our conversation about life and what's and how to live I think that's really important because otherwise and and then not just that, but making it more specific. With attentional policies and don't know if there's other ways that we can try to make it more specific to say, okay. It's really easy for everyone to agree that That is a zebra. It has stripes. We can do DNA analysis. And we can quantify a whole bunch of stuff and tell you that's a zebra. Can get some agreements.

I just wanna align humans with themselves and with each other. What do you think is a good direction for me to take this book and to make a big impact based on the ideas and concepts and kind of arguments we've built, but also based on, you know, my, experience and in post traumatic growth during my master's degree and in social entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship and training and facilitating and the way, that I kinda see it is, like, I progressed in a developmental way if you think about it. I started off training people on how to build stuff with technology, and then I realized, like, technology is not enough. We're using technology And So let's, train people on how to start businesses, to create quote unquote positive change. And social enterprises. And so we were using businesses to create good and using technologies, create good Then I realized that, you know, if you can't manage yourself, you can't manage your business, So I started getting into personal development.

Further explore NDE research connections\n2. Develop hierarchy relationships\n3. Show practical implications\n4. Create additional views\n\nThe key insight seems to be that what we think we \"need to do\" (IAPs) often comes from fear/survival orientation, while what we \"get to do\" (CAPs) emerges when we recognize what truly matters. NDEs provide dramatic evidence of this shift in perspective.\n\nShall I continue developing any aspect of this?",
