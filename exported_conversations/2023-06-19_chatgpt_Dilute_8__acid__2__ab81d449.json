      "content": "To dilute a solution to a lower concentration, you can add a solvent (in this case, water). In your situation, you're starting with 50 ml of an 8% acid solution and want to dilute it to a 2% solution.\n\nThe amount of acid in the original solution stays the same even when you add water. So the volume of the new solution should be 4 times the original volume because 8% divided by 2% is 4.\n\n50 ml * 4 = 200 ml\n\nThis means you need a total of 200 ml of solution to achieve a 2% concentration.\n\nSince you already have 50 ml of solution, you should add:\n\n200 ml - 50 ml = 150 ml\n\nSo, you need to add 150 ml of water to your 50 ml of 8% acid to get a 2% acid solution.",
