      "content": "So we are making a training program for architects and Molly, and some of our goals are to help create accessibility in the community with the social media post that they do to connect them with real customers to help them see heritage design as sustainable design and to convince their employers that heritage design and Are syllable and so the approach that we wanted to take is the sort of learn about new methods, new materials, and developing a full of quantity and from that being able to develop a return on investment equation to be able to use that to help sell to make models to make Difference simulations so that they can create design And review what we have so far with these goals and then ask me some questions so that we can be sure that it looks good. Review the facilitator notes review all of these things because I wanna come up with a facilitation guide and a Excel worksheet that we can use to operationalize it once you’ve reviewed everything according to the goals and offered me some feedback. Give me a overview of what you think. A good worksheet in facilitation guide can look like. Then you can ask me five questions so we can make a round of improvements. I’m including a Excel sheet for module three which is architecture so you can see some of the feedYou from the previous interview, interviews to inform your assessment",

      "content": "The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.",

      "content": "Below is a rapid “health-check” of Module 3 as it stands, mapped against the four headline goals you mentioned. I’ve pulled examples straight out of the current facilitator-notes deck so you can see where things already shine and where a tweak will unlock extra impact.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Goal-by-Goal Pulse Check\n\n| Goal | What’s Already Working | Gaps / Opportunities |\n|------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| **A. Public-facing social-media proof** (posts that attract real clients) | *Day 1* 60-sec hook video + WhatsApp upload gives a first taste of social storytellingfileciteturn3file13. *Day 5* “Peer-Review & Like Harvest” exercise actively iterates captions for higher engagementfileciteturn3file10. | 1) No worksheet tab to plan/track social stats (views, likes, enquiries). 2) Lacks a template post that combines “before/after ΔT” + ROI snippet + CTA. |\n| **B. Convince employers that heritage design is profitable** | BOQ fundamentals → live cost demo and link to ROI sheet clearly connect heritage details to pay-back mathsfileciteturn3file2. The “From BOQ → Comparative ROI” slide shows the conversion path kWh → IQD savingsfileciteturn3file2. | 1) Need a single-page “Employer Brief” export (logo, cost table, ROI graph, generator-fuel offset). 2) Consider inviting 2–3 employers to Day 5 pitch panel for authentic feedback. |\n| **C. Learn new heritage methods & materials** | Daily **Learn-Apply-Sell** rhythm exposes a new tactic each morning and uses tactile demos (incense stack-vent, insulation relay) to anchor theoryfileciteturn3file4. | Good, but the Excel workbook should hold a **Materials Cheat-Sheet** tab: R-value, local price/ m², embodied-energy flag. |\n| **D. Quantify value (BOQ + ROI) to sell designs** | Clear sequence: Measurement → BOQ → ROI → Pain→Price gridfileciteturn3file15. | Workbook still missing: *automatic* lookup that pulls unit-rates into BOQ rows and rolls straight into ROI dashboard; plus error-check helpers (e.g., highlight if pay-back > 4 yrs). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. What a **strong Excel workbook** should contain\n\n| Tab | Purpose | Key Features |\n|-----|---------|--------------|\n| **0 Dashboard** | Quick snapshot for trainees | Client selector; pay-back gauge; “Post-ready” KPI block (ΔT, kWh saved, IQD saved, CO₂ avoided). |\n| **1 Client Profile** | Mirror “Meet Ahmed’s Family” slide for every real lead | Auto-pull contact, pain points, baseline bills; export button to fill a one-pager. |\n| **2 Load & Climate** | Inputs only | PSH, peak ΔT, critical loads; side card shows IR-gun photos. |\n| **3 BOQ Builder** | Quantity × Rate → Cost | Drop-downs for unit type (m², m³, piece); heritage-material palette; 10 % overhead auto-addfileciteturn3file2. |\n| **4 ROI Calc** | Cost ↔ Savings | Link to Ladybug kWh CSV; tariff cell; pay-back and NPV strips; conditional format if pay-back ≤ 4 yrs. |\n| **5 Social Post Planner** | Content → Metrics | Slot for before/after image, hook line, hashtags; columns for likes/comments/enquiries to track after upload. |\n| **6 Reference** | Static look-ups | Materials R-values, embodied-energy flag, supplier contacts. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. What an **effective facilitation guide** looks like\n\n* **At-a-glance grid** – block timing, objective, materials, safety cue, DEI cue.  \n* **“Why it matters” cheat-line** – one sentence the trainer can use when energy dips.  \n* **Common snags & live fixes** – already present; keep expanding (e.g., what if Rhino license fails).  \n* **Evidence checkpoints** – where facilitators capture proof of learning (quiz delta, video uploads, BOQ accuracy).  \n* **Community bridge moments** – highlight when to invite Instagram Live, bring an employer, or schedule a site visit.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Immediate Feedback\n\n1. **Celebrate** – The current deck already bakes sales thinking into every day (Pain→Price, 1-min hooks, Lightning pitches).  \n2. **Integrate** – Push the ROI worksheets sooner (Day 2) so teams iterate numbers while design ideas are still fluid.  \n3. **Expose to outsiders** – Add a Day 5 mini-expo: students post their one-pager + video to an open WhatsApp/Instagram thread where real residents or employers can react in real time.  \n4. **Workbook <> Slide harmony** – every slide that shows a formula or template should have a matching cell range in the workbook (named ranges help).  \n5. **Accessibility cue** – create a “Social-Proof in 3 clicks” sidebar in the guide: pick best roof photo → drop into Canva template → export & post.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Five Questions for our next iteration\n\n1. **Who exactly are the “real customers” you want students to reach on social media—home-owners, small-business owners, or municipal bodies?**  \n2. **Which ROI pay-back threshold will feel compelling in Mosul’s current market (≤ 3 yrs, ≤ 4 yrs, or something else)?**  \n3. **Do you already have unit-rate tables verified with local suppliers that we can preload into the BOQ tab, or should we build a form for trainees to gather prices during field visits?**  \n4. **How comfortable are participants with digital tools (Rhino/Revit/Ladybug)?** – this will decide whether the workbook needs a simple manual kWh-to-IQD calculator as fallback.  \n5. **Would you like the Day 5 expo to include employer jurors giving scores (credibility boost) or keep it peer-only for a safer learning space?**\n\nAnswer these and we’ll fine-tune both the workbook structure and the hour-by-hour facilitation notes.",
