The concept note is available online for your reference.\n\nRecognized as one of the “UN Intergovernmental and Multi-Stakeholder Digital Cooperation Bodies and Forums”,this annual event convenes the community of digital education leaders, policy-makers, researchers and practitioners from various organizations, including UN agencies, governments, NGOs, academia and the private sector.\n\nDigital Learning Week 2024 aims to promote multi-stakeholder cooperation towards a human-centred and green design and use of AI in education, with a specific focus on exploring the interlinkages between digital transformation and greening education.\n\nTo surface best practices and facilitate knowledge sharing on the intersection of digital and green transformations, UNESCO is currently selecting presentations through a call for proposals. A separate call for presentations on the theme of AI and education is available here.\n\nSelected presenters will have the unique opportunity to address a global audience comprising policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, private sector partners and development agencies.\n\nPlease note that UNESCO mainly seeks proposals pertaining to practices that have been implemented at scale, which means that conceptual ideas without practical implementation are not preferable.\n\nThe form below requests a narrative description of your presentations while personal information such as email addresses will not be shared. If your presentation is selected for inclusion in the programme, the description you provide will be used directly on the UNESCO website and other communication materials. Please allow yourself sufficient time to complete the required fields and ensure clarity and readability of the text. Only proposals in English or French will be considered.\n\nPresentation proposals must be submitted to UNESCO no later than 5 June 2024. Selected proposals will be notified by 28 June 2024.\n\nPlease note that only selected submissions will be notified via email.\n\nEach participant will be responsible for their own travel and accommodations to Digital Learning Week.\n\n* Greening education is a communication term used to describe a holistic approach to education’s response to the climate crisis as demanded by young people. Greening education empowers learners with the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to engage in transformative action on mitigation, adaptation and resilience to climate change, with the aim of shaping green, low emission climate-resilient societies.\n\nGreen technologies, also known as sustainable or eco-friendly technologies, are innovations aimed at reducing negative environmental impacts and promoting sustainability. These technologies are designed to minimize resource consumption, decrease pollution, and mitigate climate change (green design).\n\n \n1. Please select the sub-theme of your presentation *\nTheme selected:C.2 Good practices of AI tools to identify and counteract misinformation on climate change (e.g. fact-checking AI algorithms, safeguards against content manipulation and deepfakes on climate change, bots to identify misinformation, etc.)\nB.2 Good practices of using digital technology for promoting responsible climate actions.\n\nuse this content betweeen 3 brackets [[[Title: GREEN LEARN: Greening Aspirations through Supporting Metacognition and Aspirational Re-appraisal Using Large Language Models\n\nNarrative Description:\n\nIn my presentation, \"GREEN LEARN: Greening Aspirations through Supporting Metacognition and Aspirational Re-appraisal Using Large Language Models (LLMs),\" I will explore the transformative potential of LLMs in fostering a green, human-centered educational landscape. Drawing from my extensive experience with non-profits and social enterprises, I have gathered qualitative data on how these organizations perceive and utilize LLMs, often treating them as another type of software. This presentation will introduce a novel approach: integrating a system prompt designed to support goal reappraisal and promote metacognition, with the aim of nurturing a more ecologically mindful worldview.\n\nThe core of my talk will present a theory of ethics and a philosophical foundation based on prior research demonstrating that certain types of mindfulness and meditation practices are promoters of pro-environmental behaviors and actions. I will demonstrate how the reverse engineering of biomimetic technology allows us to craft system prompts that offer affordances to leverage wisdom gained through experience from the embedding space. By identifying how these affordances promote sustainability-oriented education for collective wellbeing, we can bypass the traditional \"elite college -> elite consulting group -> green non-profit\" pipeline.\n\nTo provide practical insights, I will discuss strategies that are currently under research and implementation, with results ready to present by October. These strategies include the development and implementation of white papers and recommendations for modifying the reinforcement learning components of LLMs. The goal is to create interfaces that incorporate affordances designed to promote metacognition, goal reappraisal, and ultimately foster an inner revolution conducive to a greener world.\n\nThis presentation will not only offer a conceptual framework but will also showcase practical applications and strategies that have been implemented at scale. Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of how to harness LLMs to support self-paced foundational skill acquisition, facilitate inquiry-based learning, and promote ecological consciousness among learners.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe objective of this presentation is to share best practices and innovative approaches for integrating AI and LLMs into educational systems to foster metacognition, goal reappraisal, and ecological mindfulness. By highlighting practical implementations and providing actionable recommendations, this talk aims to inspire educators, policy-makers, and digital education leaders to adopt and scale these practices in their own contexts, contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive future.\n\nThis version integrates the emphasis on specific types of mindfulness and meditation practices and keeps the proposal aligned with UNESCO's goals for Digital Learning Week 2024.\nGATSMARULLM? is the acronym where's the cool name with an acronym - also can you make it 300 words max\n\nChatGPT\nCertainly!
