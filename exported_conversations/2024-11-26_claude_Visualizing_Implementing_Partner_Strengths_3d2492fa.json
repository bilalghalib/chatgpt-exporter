We have conducted training on first aid for cultural heritage in times of crisis, tourist and archaeological guiding, and vocational training for youth\",\"Sustainable Construction,Entrepreneurship,Soft Skills\",3,Ninewa Governorate,1,Yes,\"‏The idea behind establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” emerged after years of contemplating the importance of documenting, preserving, and rescuing both tangible and intangible heritage. This vision is achieved by organizing various activities, cultural events, and festivals, as well as supporting government bodies involved in heritage conservation. Additionally, the foundation focuses on empowering youth and professionals through developmental training, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals to foster sustainable cities and communities.\n\n‏This concept was born in response to a series of wars and conflicts that had taken a toll on Nineveh Province, resulting in the loss of many historic cities and archaeological sites. These conflicts negatively impacted the city’s tangible and intangible heritage, cultural legacy, and led to a rise in youth unemployment, revealing an urgent need for skill development to prepare young people for the labor market and to inspire community-driven projects that benefit Iraqi society.\n\n‏The most significant and damaging event in the city’s modern history was the occupation by ISIS in 2014, followed by the liberation war in 2017. These events saw extremist groups destroy much of the remaining old city of Mosul. In response, a group of young people came together to launch the foundation as a voluntary effort, driven by a commitment to safeguarding Iraq’s identity. The project was launched to highlight archaeological and heritage sites, revive cultural heritage, and promote social cohesion among Nineveh’s diverse ethnicities and religions, aiming to foster peace and coexistence. This effort is seen as a vital step in encouraging displaced residents to return to their homes and to preserve the rich heritage and coexistence that define the city.\n\n‏The significance of establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” lies in preserving the historical character of the city, supporting heritage protection efforts alongside government bodies, and partnering with international organizations and the global community. The foundation also envisions fostering connections among youth through awareness-raising and developmental workshops to promote the heritage and history of Nineveh and Iraq, and implementing activities that develop the skills of professionals in culture, heritage, and development fields.\",\"The Foundation is committed to achieving its goals through building partnerships and expanding the fields it works in, especially in development and growth through culture, heritage, or capacity building.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s expertise and extensive network, it has earned significant community trust, with over 100,000 visitors to the Foundation in the past two years, as well as participants in its regular programs.\n\nTherefore, our vision is that the program aligns with our shared goals, and together we can achieve the best outcomes.\",\"We believe that the Mosul Heritage Foundation and the work team have field experience and a strong network of relationships, whether with government agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, or the local community.

Here's what each chart shows:\n\n1. Partner Average Scores: Shows overall ranking with color-coded bars indicating performance tiers\n2. Evaluation Criteria Radar: Compares the top 3 partners across 6 key evaluation criteria\n3. Demographics Reach: Shows each partner's reach across youth, women, and marginalized populations\n4. Social Media Presence: Compares Instagram and LinkedIn followers for each partner\n\nKey insights from the visualizations:\n- Mosul Space and Makers of Baghdad consistently lead across most metrics\n- There's a significant gap between the top 4 and bottom 3 partners in overall scores\n- Most partners have strong youth engagement but vary in women and marginalized populations reach\n- Social media presence varies greatly, with The Station having the largest following\n- The top partners show balanced performance across all evaluation criteria\n\nWould you like me to modify any of the charts or add additional visualizations to highlight specific aspects of the comparison?",

Here's what each chart shows:\n\n1. Partner Average Scores: Shows overall ranking with color-coded bars indicating performance tiers\n2. Evaluation Criteria Radar: Compares the top 3 partners across 6 key evaluation criteria\n3. Demographics Reach: Shows each partner's reach across youth, women, and marginalized populations\n4. Social Media Presence: Compares Instagram and LinkedIn followers for each partner\n\nKey insights from the visualizations:\n- Mosul Space and Makers of Baghdad consistently lead across most metrics\n- There's a significant gap between the top 4 and bottom 3 partners in overall scores\n- Most partners have strong youth engagement but vary in women and marginalized populations reach\n- Social media presence varies greatly, with The Station having the largest following\n- The top partners show balanced performance across all evaluation criteria\n\nWould you like me to modify any of the charts or add additional visualizations to highlight specific aspects of the comparison?",

Removing the `Cell` component import and usage\n2. Instead, using multiple `Scatter` components with different data filters to achieve the same color coding\n3. Added `fill` property to the data objects\n4. Added legends to make the distinctions clearer\n\nThe charts now show:\n1. Age vs Score - with distinct points for organizations with/without sustainability expertise\n2. Experience vs Programs - with points colored by score ranges\n3. Topics vs Size - with distinct points for organizations with/without sustainability expertise\n\nThe visualization should now work correctly while maintaining all the insights from the previous version. Would you like me to adjust any of the visualizations or add additional features?",

Removed the ZAxis import and usage\n2. Modified the second chart to show organization size through different Scatter series instead of bubble size\n3. Enhanced the CustomTooltip to show more relevant information for each chart\n4. Grouped organizations by size (small, medium, large) for clearer visualization\n5. Added more descriptive labels and legends\n\nThe charts now show:\n1. Age vs Score - comparing sustainability expertise\n2. Experience vs Programs - comparing organization sizes\n3. Topics vs Employees - comparing sustainability expertise\n\nThe visualizations should work correctly now. Would you like any adjustments to the ranges for organization sizes or other aspects of the charts?",

Added consistent margins around all charts (40px on all sides)\n2. Increased the height of chart containers to 400px\n3. Added legend styling with:\n   - Horizontal layout\n   - Centered alignment\n   - Top positioning with offset\n   - Added padding between legend items\n4. Consistent spacing between charts\n\nThe legends should now be clearly visible without overlapping. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments to the layout or styling!",

Added consistent margins around all charts (40px on all sides)\n2. Increased the height of chart containers to 400px\n3. Added legend styling with:\n   - Horizontal layout\n   - Centered alignment\n   - Top positioning with offset\n   - Added padding between legend items\n4. Consistent spacing between charts\n\nThe legends should now be clearly visible without overlapping. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments to the layout or styling!",
