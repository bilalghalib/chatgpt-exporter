      "content": "Can you turn this transcript into a well structured document. Don't change the text too much:\n00:00 Hey, hi, how's it going? Ahmet, hey Munir. I wanted to request your review because we are moving forward on this assessment process for the Axi program and we really like your thought.\n00:16 I wanted to walk over some of our thinking kind of with a video just because I know that it might help clarify things a little bit better.\n00:26 It might be more fun hopefully and so I'm just gonna walk you through some of the documentation that we have ready for you.\n00:32 Or review and some of the thinking behind what we're doing. Okay so we used to have a framework called the individual pillar and it had basically what is known as soft skills or 21st century skills, universal skills, transversals skills, there's a million words.\n00:48 To describe it and we were using the skills builder framework that was coming from a kind of more high school oriented assessment and we weren't finding it very useful.\n01:01 And also a lot of the different assessments That's it. Hence that our self reported we were getting issues. We were seeing that people actually reduce and score by the end of the program and that the assessment wasn't something that people were super excited to take at the end because it was not providing\n01:19 a lot of value. But we would need this information because it was what we were using for reporting. It was what we were kind of basing our assumption on that we could actually help people quote unquote grow and that this tool is measuring growth.\n01:33 Umm, that is uhh That has proven to be difficult because the people when they take the assessment wind up getting a better awareness of the scope of their knowledge throughout the course of the program and are more appropriately scoring themselves at the end which makes it very messy.\n01:51 Not only that we don't know what people are meaning by a three for somebody umm uhh some people have different biases and of course there's statistical methods to kind of analyze that but that's a research project umm not necessarily something that we can use as like a pre-po stay let's like pull some\n02:09 dials move some levers umm and I've been we've been actually if you look into our certificate and credentials exploration we've been thinking about credentialing for a long time and as I started doing the research on Thanks watching!\n02:24 Skills for leadership I realized that these are how HR departments are working now they are looking for practical observable verifiable ways to indicate that people have skills We are now at the umm the self scoring and the assessments that's great but they are moving towards verifiable skills and they\n02:46 are using all sorts of things including AI games to kind of see how people respond rather than ask people to tell them something or even get a third party.\n02:56 So the industry is shifting towards skills verification including badges. So I thought let's catch up. And EntraComp actually has a badge document that they've umm the You uuh is the entrepreneurial competency framework.\n03:16 They actually put a lot of thinking into what exactly represents a skill and what is the competency and how is it helpful for developing entrepreneurial attitudes and not only that.\n03:27 Thank much. They've in their research shown that these developments of entrepreneurial capacities isn't just making Europe and the rest of the world more like America.\n03:35 It's actually helpful for people to develop job skills and they've done a mapping that goes from entrepreneurial capacities to individuals.\n03:44 . So you can see if I learn these things, if I'm good at these ultra competencies, these are the jobs I can get, and skills that are used in the European Union's validated skills framework for jobs and mobility.\n03:58 So people that have a skill in Spain, they validate it somehow and that skill is more transferable. So they've done a lot of thinking and they're aligning it really deeply across many countries and so I think it's a reasonable approach.\n04:13 And for us as an entrepreneurial program, it's a great thing to work So, the decision to move away from self-reporting to this process that we're looking at as awareness, reflection, and validation.\n04:28 So awareness is just to know the lay of the land and it comes from this quote over here, recognition, proceeds, knowledge.\n04:35 It's basically a way to create the compartments in your mind to realize like oh so we're gonna be learning this, this new thing that I just saw, it fits into there.\n04:45 And then this other thing, it fits into there. And so we We are working on the awareness level assessment. It's going to be really fast and we're designing the program to incorporate these things in a more fun and smooth and uhh simple way rather than saying go home and take an assessment or like everyone\n05:07 pause and we're taking the assessment all together this is going to be on mentee meter this is going to be in real time this is going to be at the end of the first boot camp session to give people the lay of the land and the beginning of the thinking of like okay .\n05:20 . What is leadership for entrepreneurs is that even a skill what is a skill what is a competency for like developing leadership well do you often think of new ways approach challenges do you take the lead taking the initiative so you just answer these questions true and false altogether and we show people\n05:39 kind of where we're strong as a community of people developing competencies leadership competencies for entrepreneurship then the idea proceeds from there to the reflection level you so umm taking the assessment and sharing a reflection this is where we get people to begin to the assessment and this \n06:02 goes to our platform now so we are developing it so that it's a Likert scale we're working looking up. On kind of finding like the minimum maximum for these umm elements from the Entra comp we also are working with the Entra comps reduced framework because there's something called the ECI Entra comps\n06:24 . Comp realized that nobody is actually using using Entra comp and so they actually came up with the Entra comp implementation project the ECI and I think is that the URL for it?\n06:38 Yeah here it is. So. The ECI's objective of operationalizing the Entra comp framework and they picked these six because they're they think are the most practical and operationalizable.\n06:50 So going from there we have chosen those sub elements created activity, ethical, sustainable living, self-awareness, uhh self-efficacy, mobilizing others, taking the initiative and coping with ambiguity and risk.\n07:04 And there's this assessment element where the important part is actually here. And and actually I think very importantly I miss an element.\n07:13 Actually after the awareness process everyone gets a badge. And the everyone who who does the mensie, mensie meter slash other All right.\n07:28 Collaborative. Everyone who does this assessment in that collaborative tool will get their very first badges. So we actually begin from day one talking about badges talking about the fact that it actually gives them at the end.\n07:44 There are lot of verifiable uhh ways of demonstrating skills because we're going to as bloom develop this badge means that this.\n07:55 But this is the beginning to help people learn about the badging tools and give them a very simple level zero or level one.\n08:03 I am aware of what it means to be an entrepreneurial leader. That's it. That's all it means and the verified thing for that is going to be the fact that they took the mentee meter.\n08:13 Maybe we like output the results of that with an email address or something. Okay, so these are, so this is you know my thinking about the kinds of questions.\n08:24 It needs to be relevant to the competency. It needs to be fact based. It needs to help like prompt insight.\n08:29 It needs to be progressive. Initially I wanted We'll see you next week. I have questions for each. We changed our mind.\n08:34 I think I'm just gonna like remove that because we went down to just one question. We wanted to be fast.\n08:39 We wanted to be fun. We wanted to be on day one. Okay, so then the reflection element. We're gonna use the likeart over here and so what we're doing is after the awareness element there's this element of the learning loop where people are reflecting or integrating new knowledge and then this part is \n08:57 the doing part. This is the cool thing about the learning by doing is that usually the doing comes with outcomes.\n09:04 All right. Thank you. All right. So it's going to be a presentation that they recorded on loom or it's going to be a worksheet for their business model or it's going to be they filled out something or they they even did a phone call maybe they record the audio but the doing is going to be here and then\n09:18 of course it goes back. I with with the reflection but this these results in the verifiable badges that we need to get very clear on what it means for someone to be a level one creative entrepreneurial leader.\n09:36 What does it mean for someone to be a level two creative entrepreneur or leader? And each of those things will have different verification criteria.\n09:46 So it's another one of those things where we add a framing. We tell people in order to get creative level two.\n09:52 Thank you. Umm, we need to see you exhibiting X, Y, and Z skills. So this is something that we have not done yet.\n09:58 We are working on doing that next. So we're moving from framing and developing the thinking beyond umm the self-reported assessments into a the United the longest the United States in In the investment that is uhh useful for the people that take it no matter if they get into the program they don't get\n10:14 into the program they'll have something and what's really cool is actually using open badges 2.0 it can go directly into Linkedin.\n10:20 So if they have a badge they can umm upload it into Linkedin and umm I was suggesting we actually make the badge saying like uhh what does this mean click me find more you know it has creative leader at level 0 and they click it and then it will actually give them uhh what it means so you know you go\n10:40 into Thanks for watching! Linkedin you say someone says they're a creative leader but then you click and you open it up and it's like oh my god this is their whole portfolio of like here's the frameworks that they have developed themselves for how to have divergence and convergent thinking whatever it\n10:53 is so it's gonna have to have a very specific thing and that's gonna be Thank you. Really cool work that hopefully we'll do in the month of February and then the reasoning keep the entrepreneurs in the driver's seat this we already talked the reasoning behind why we're moving the structure from self \n11:07 reporting or even third party reporting or even psychometric assessments that try to like get at something from trying regulation to something that's more concrete and practical awareness raising developing this reflective process and creating evidence that they can take with them because we're learning\n11:24 by doing system this really makes a lot of sense to me and it resolves the issue of slippage Thanks for watching!\n11:28 Umm it gives them out of the territory uhh and it gives them power to give informal badges yeah so also using these open badging tools umm what I would like people to do is incentivize so we still use the leaderboard but incentivize people to give each other badges when they see them see people displaying\n11:46 those skills so for instance umm we ask a question and then somebody answers the question first we could even prompt them to say hey uhh does anybody see somebody taking initiative is that a leadership scheme?\n12:00 Skill? You know? And uhh who's gonna give this person their badge first umm the badging systems are quite simple uhh and there are even tools that let us use something like google uhh forms to create a badge so we can say here's the form for giving each other badges and so people kind of get too you \n12:16 levels of badges one is like the verified by bloom bloom.pm slash badges description gives you like all the badges that people can get and then exactly what it means and what are appropriate like criteria for unlocking that badge.\n12:33 What this also does and what this also means we need to do is go through the bloom training framework and processes and pull out things like our work plan and pull out things like the activities and identify which of the criteria And to talk to you into those so that we integrate this new system with\n12:50 all of the stuff that we've been building. Okay. Yeah so instead of the arbitrariness of 100 teams going from 4.2 for 4.3 and a self assessment of a reported skill and we might have to even say okay we took the absolute value because Because have to Because be careful. Because you have Because you have\n13:04 Even if they scored lower it just means that they got better at understanding their differences and it's just what the what the what this is good for so everyone knows that this was not a waste of time this data all this research first of all like if we look at what happened happened during XE 2 and \n13:22 the and the or is XE 1 XE 1 and the blast is that we learned that our programs actually support people to promote pro-symmatic growth we learned a lot of things because we had research but we had to kind of Thank you.\n13:36 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Qualify that we had to do the statistical methods we had to identify which factors were supportive and which factors were not supportive we had long form interviews and so this type of self-assessment was great for research but I don't think it's great for \n13:49 our teams to develop practical skills. We'll next week. We'll see next week. We'll see you next week. Was supposed to be helpful, but I think part, it was maybe 20% useless.\n14:04 So how can we make it just like really action oriented, really concrete? Really simple and specific and it goes all the way down to like I need to learn this skill so I can make this output so I can get a verified badge so I can put it on my LinkedIn so I can get a job or I need to do all those things\n14:19 so I can be a better leader in my business. Like it all needs to add up and I feel like this is the time to do it.\n14:24 Umm so yeah the assessment should be fine or fast to do and it frames the programs umm self critiques you can see me critiquing myself but there's some really cool reasons so I wanted to show you guys this part like I mentioned.\n14:40 . . Connecting the E-S-E-S-C-O which is a huge ginormous framing of all the occupation skills and qualifications that is available in the EU and it's huge.\n14:57 Umm but what's really cool is here you can see how they connected EntraComp with the skills so if you go to page 7 these are these are all the skills in ESCO so S-1.1 negotiation, negotiating Thank you.\n15:12 Thank you. Nching contracts, responding to complaints, that's the tah. Umm and then what they made is well here's the EntraComp elements, the competencies and then here's how they lead to all of these different skills over here.\n15:27 Umm really cool and it's really practical and this the cool thing is after here you can actually even go over here and look at like different qualifications, different trainings, we can find different activities to develop very specific competencies and skills and you know they can bring it into their\n15:41 businesses or they can use it to get jobs. The other framing is rolls. So over here are all the rolls.\n15:51 So you can see there's meteorologists and chemists and it's very, very, very detailed, very, very detailed. Actors, I wonder if 25, 265, We'll week.\n16:00 We'll week. We'll week. We'll see We'll see is available for anything in actual comp. Ah, it doesn't look like it.\n16:04 Uhh, musicians. Oh yeah, it's here. Okay. So they're saying that mobilizing others is, oh no, it didn't fit all the way.\n16:12 2652. Yeah. Good. 265. Wait, 265. Yeah, these are all 265s. So this is the more specific, the higher level role.\n16:25 So 265 is creative and performing arts. And I think it's kind of true actually. They say that creativity is responsible for it.\n16:32 . On it. That it fits into self-awareness and self-efficacy taking initiative and so on and so forth. So this is some of the pros for using Entrecomp and I thought I'd bring that up.\n16:45 But some critiques. If this is supposed to replace Top 6 place our universal skill, then we are missing a even newer element that they've developed called the life comp.\n16:58 And they're creating a bunch of comps actually. So if you want to see We'll you in next one. Life comp.\n17:05 Life comp has really they also have a green comp for sustainable competent, sustainability competencies. I think the foreword was the interesting part.\n17:18 But yeah they suggest that life comp is the crucial element for all the skills. They also created a digital competency for citizens, the entrepreneurial competency, there's the green competencies now and then there's the life comp.\n17:31 Life comp is more directly related to things that were mentioned before including the interdevelopment goals and the universal skills and some of the more soft soft skills.\n17:42 However you want to frame them. But what they're suggesting is that where is it? Baseline. That life comp is the baseline because if you see life comp has things like self-regulation, flexibility, well-being, empathy, communication, collaboration, growth mindset, critical thinking and managing learning\n18:06 . That before you go to any . . . The other competency frameworks, we need to have this as a basic. And so I think I kind of mentioned that here in my .\n18:16 . . Yeah. See we decided to focus on . . . No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do I say it?\n18:23 Good. I did not say it. Okay, so I'll say it right now. So . . . Maybe we fork people very early. We do a very quick assessment either through an interview where someone kind of checks Thanks for watching.\n18:40 Some questions and checks whether or not they have the baseline for some of these things. I don't know how we would do it.\n18:47 Umm easiest, but before you get into my programs you should have the basics of life comp. Otherwise we need to develop a life comp program uhh to be able to make sure that people have the basics.\n18:56 Umm baseline qualities that will support what do they call competencies to support them for the future stuff. Umm and of course I would recommend like I just did that we move towards badging that we move towards umm concrete verifiable uhh simple fast fun and useful.\n19:12 Useful. For participants assessments. Umm I wanted also to show that uhh other benefits of using Entrecomp is they've even though not a lot of people are using it and they know it.\n19:23 Umm they are already using the open badge framework uhh and they have Thanks watching! A bunch of Entrecomp badges there and they have this pocket guide for Entrep- aspiring entrepreneurs which has a description of Entrecomp and then even all these resources for each and every one of them.\n19:44 Of the elements. Into action you can have like a PDF online so entrepreneurial management. So these are the skills that you need umm this is a PDF that you can use and so this will help us really build out our umm uhh reflection to activity uhh.\n20:00 Quickly. And it will help us get grants with the EU in the future. So those are some of our thinking about the Anjokov.\n20:09 I wanted to walk you through a little bit of this because you could either read it or you can listen to this at 2x speed for 10 minutes.\n20:15 . Mm-hmm. This is the step one. It's gonna be in the beginning of the program. It's going to be just you know building out that that infrastructure for where this learning in a fit.\n20:25 Like what does it mean to be an uuh uuh uuh an uuh a leader for entrepreneurship. And then this is gonna be the reflection time.\n20:33 The part that we didn't get to. That I've started working on I called it observable activities. So these are potentially going to be the things like business plans, prioritize tasks in a project management simulation.\n20:47 So maybe you like take a screenshot of your Asana and your prioritization or or something. Like these are going to have to be reviewed and developed and already aligned with stuff inside of our framework aligned with the stuff inside of the the aspiring entrepreneurs thing.\n21:06 Those are our next steps. I just wanted to get you a big overview. Umm tell you a little bit of our thinking.\n21:12 Show you how we're still using our assessment framework especially in the reflection elements. Umm but the fact that we're not going to have pre-post necessarily.\n21:19 Thanks, Sarah Lee. Umm as we used to with numbers but what I would recommend is for the observable activities it would be levels.\n21:28 So level. And this is going to be like 1, 2, 3. And you know if you have a basic Thanks again.\n21:36 If you plan 1, if you have a business plan with data coming in from you know outside resources directly from your Shopify webpage that might be a 3 and you take a screenshot of your Shopify webpage and how it fits into the diagram of your thing.\n21:50 So different levels of verification. And the kind of pre-post that we can do is immediately after the reflection see if we can get anything to bring them into a verifiable badge that we can give them.\n22:08 They can be level- basically they should have a verifiable one just level zero awareness right? Level one we could even include the reflection about what it means for them to be creative and how it can relate to business and then we can go up from there to further and further more valid and verifiable\n22:27 and yeah stronger developed skills so the beginning of the program would be you know they might be over here or even they might even be further along if they're developed at the end of the program they would be here but the main thing that we're showing funders is the page of badges that are verified\n22:48 we could even do like a LinkedIn search of just showing like how many people are adding these badges on LinkedIn and what they mean what it means that these things are exactly existing and the number that we want to see grow more and more is bloom verified PM and mentor badges out there.\n23:04 I didn't talk a lot about it, actually I don't know if you even mentioned it but I also want to encourage people to give each other badges but those don't necessarily need the badge.\n23:12 To be super validated or vetted it's more to encourage people to support each other it's like a shout out badge or it's like a badge for seeing somebody perform a skill.\n23:27 You and want to encourage them and people could still you know use these badges and put them around but they're not going to mean the same thing as a bloom verified badge with the link directly to the quality that we're looking for.\n23:40 Okay sorry the skill that we're looking for that has a . Output which is the learning by doing and the doing is making a thing creating a talisman that we put into the thing so that's it that's what we're thinking so far the place to give your feedback would be this one although even .\n24:00 . Just talking through it like I realize we made some advancements since this document was written but it would be great to get your feedback over here and the feedback also could be done on the leadership for entrepreneurs awareness level so that one's this one over here and we're trying to get one \n24:19 question make it really fast you can review the questions you can also review the reflection level which we also gave some time one thing that we haven't done but it's really important is we want to write .\n24:32 A really good prompt here first before using GPT and then having GPT improve it but this is going to be an important thing they're going to fill in three questions and then they're going to ask for some reflection.\n24:45 Alright guys what do you think umm or didn't show you the platforms but there's open badges, passport and open badges to design badges.\n24:56 The passport already has an app people can just download it and start actually getting and receiving and it's going to be fun or they can just get it in their email basically we can even put it into You",

      "content": "**Document Title:** Bilal's Explanation of Decisions for Creating a Badging System\n\n**Introduction**\nHey, hi, how's it going? Ahmet, hey Munir. I wanted to request your review because we are moving forward on this assessment process for the Axi program and we really like your thought. I wanted to walk over some of our thinking kind of with a video just because I know that it might help clarify things a little bit better. It might be more fun hopefully and so I'm just gonna walk you through some of the documentation that we have ready for you. Or review and some of the thinking behind what we're doing.\n\n**Transition from Individual Pillar Framework to Skills Builder Framework**\nOkay, so we used to have a framework called the individual pillar and it had basically what is known as soft skills or 21st-century skills, universal skills, transversal skills, there's a million words. To describe it and we were using the skills builder framework that was coming from a kind of more high school oriented assessment and we weren't finding it very useful. And also a lot of the different assessments That's it. Hence that our self-reported we were getting issues. We were seeing that people actually reduce and score by the end of the program and that the assessment wasn't something that people were super excited to take at the end because it was not providing a lot of value. But we would need this information because it was what we were using for reporting. It was what we were kind of basing our assumption on that we could actually help people quote unquote grow and that this tool is measuring growth.\n\n**Challenges with Current Assessment Methodology**\nUmm, that is uhh That has proven to be difficult because the people when they take the assessment wind up getting a better awareness of the scope of their knowledge throughout the course of the program and are more appropriately scoring themselves at the end which makes it very messy. Not only that we don't know what people are meaning by a three for somebody umm uhh some people have different biases and of course there's statistical methods to kind of analyze that but that's a research project umm not necessarily something that we can use as like a pre-po stay let's like pull some dials move some levers umm and I've been we've been actually if you look into our certificate and credentials exploration we've been thinking about credentialing for a long time and as I started doing the research on Thanks watching!\n\n**Shifting to Skills Verification and Industry Trends**\nSkills for leadership I realized that these are how HR departments are working now they are looking for practical observable verifiable ways to indicate that people have skills We are now at the umm the self-scoring and the assessments that's great but they are moving towards verifiable skills and they are using all sorts of things including AI games to kind of see how people respond rather than ask people to tell them something or even get a third party. So the industry is shifting towards skills verification including badges. So I thought let's catch up. And EntraComp actually has a badge document that they've umm the You uuh is the entrepreneurial competency framework. They actually put a lot of thinking into what exactly represents a skill and what is the competency and how is it helpful for developing entrepreneurial attitudes and not only that.\n\n**Benefit of Developing Entrepreneurial Capacities**\nThank much. They've in their research shown that these developments of entrepreneurial capacities isn't just making Europe and the rest of the world more like America. It's actually helpful for people to develop job skills and they've done a mapping that goes from entrepreneurial capacities to individuals. So you can see if I learn these things, if I'm good at these ultra competencies, these are the jobs I can get, and skills that are used in the European Union's validated skills framework for jobs and mobility. So people that have a skill in Spain, they validate it somehow and that skill is more transferable. So they've done a lot of thinking and they're aligning it really deeply across many countries and so I think it's a reasonable approach.\n\n**Implementing a New Assessment Framework**\nAnd for us as an entrepreneurial program, it's a great thing to work So, the decision to move away from self-reporting to this process that we're looking at as awareness, reflection, and validation. So awareness is just to know the lay of the land and it comes from this quote over here, recognition proceeds knowledge. It's basically a way to create the compartments in your mind to realize like oh so we're gonna be learning this, this new thing that I just saw, it fits into there. And then this other thing, it fits into there. And so we We are working on the awareness level assessment. It's going to be really fast and we're designing the program to incorporate these things in a more fun and smooth and uhh simple way rather than saying go home and take an assessment or like everyone pause and we're taking the assessment all together this is going to be",

What is leadership for entrepreneurs is that even a skill what is a skill what is a competency for like developing leadership well do you often think of new ways approach challenges do you take the lead taking the initiative so you just answer these questions true and false altogether and we show people kind of where we're strong as a community of people developing competencies leadership competencies for entrepreneurship then the idea proceeds from there to the reflection level you so umm taking the assessment and sharing a reflection this is where we get people to begin to the assessment and this goes to our platform now so we are developing it so that it's a Likert scale we're working looking up. On kind of finding like the minimum maximum for these umm elements from the Entra comp we also are working with the Entra comps reduced framework because there's something called the ECI Entra comps. Comp realized that nobody is actually using Entra comp and so they actually came up with the Entra comp implementation project the ECI and I think is that the URL for it?\n\n[Continued in the next message]",

The ECI's objective of operationalizing the EntraComp framework and they picked these six because they're they think are the most practical and operationalizable. So going from there we have chosen those sub-elements created activity, ethical, sustainable living, self-awareness, uhh self-efficacy, mobilizing others, taking the initiative, and coping with ambiguity and risk. And there's this assessment element where the important part is actually here. And and actually I think very importantly I miss an element.\n\n**Badge Distribution and Its Impact**\nActually after the awareness process everyone gets a badge. And the everyone who who does the mentee, mentee meter slash other All right. Collaborative. Everyone who does this assessment in that collaborative tool will get their very first badges. So we actually begin from day one talking about badges talking about the fact that it actually gives them at the end. There are a lot of verifiable uhh ways of demonstrating skills because we're going to as bloom develop this badge means that this. But this is the beginning to help people learn about the badging tools and give them a very simple level zero or level one. I am aware of what it means to be an entrepreneurial leader. That's it. That's all it means and the verified thing for that is going to be the fact that they took the mentee meter.\n\n**Enhancing the Badge System**\nMaybe we like output the results of that with an email address or something. Okay, so these are, so this is you know my thinking about the kinds of questions. It needs to be relevant to the competency. It needs to be fact-based. It needs to help like prompt insight. It needs to be progressive. Initially I wanted We'll see you next week. I have questions for each. We changed our mind. I think I'm just gonna like remove that because we went down to just one question. We wanted to be fast. We wanted to be fun. We wanted to be on day one. Okay, so then the reflection element. We're gonna use the likeart over here and so what we're doing is after the awareness element there's this element of the learning loop where people are reflecting or integrating new knowledge and then this part is the doing part. This is the cool thing about the learning by doing is that usually the doing comes with outcomes.\n\n**Outcomes and Validation**\nAll right. Thank you. All right. So it's going to be a presentation that they recorded on loom or it's going to be a worksheet for their business model or it's going to be they filled out something or they they even did a phone call maybe they record the audio but the doing is going to be here and then of course it goes back. I with with the reflection but this these results in the verifiable badges that we need to get very clear on what it means for someone to be a level one creative entrepreneurial leader. What does it mean for someone to be a level two creative entrepreneur or leader? And each of those things will have different verification criteria.\n\n**Setting Standards for Badge Levels**\nSo it's another one of those things where we add a framing. We tell people in order to get creative level two. Thank you. Umm, we need to see you exhibiting X, Y, and Z skills. So this is something that we have not done yet. We are working on doing that next. So we're moving from framing and developing the thinking beyond umm the self-reported assessments into a the United the longest the United States in In the investment that is uhh useful for the people that take it no matter if they get into the program they don't get into the program they'll have something and what's really cool is actually using open badges 2.0 it can go directly into Linkedin.\n\n**Integration with LinkedIn and Badge Details**\nSo if they have a badge they can umm upload it into Linkedin and umm I was suggesting we actually make the badge saying like uhh what does this mean click me find more you know it has creative leader at level 0 and they click it and then it will actually give them uhh what it means so you know you go into Thanks for watching! Linkedin you say someone says they're a creative leader but then you click and you open it up and it's like oh my god this is their whole portfolio of like here's the frameworks that they have developed themselves for how to have divergence and convergent thinking whatever it is so it's gonna have to have a very specific thing and that's gonna be Thank you. Really cool work that hopefully we'll do in the month of February and then the reasoning keep the entrepreneurs in the driver's seat this we already talked the reasoning behind why we're moving the structure from self-reporting or even third-party reporting or even psychometric assessments that try to like get at something from trying regulation to something that's more concrete and practical awareness raising developing this reflective process and creating evidence that they can",

Skill? You know? And uhh who's gonna give this person their badge first umm the badging systems are quite simple uhh and there are even tools that let us use something like google uhh forms to create a badge so we can say here's the form for giving each other badges and so people kind of get too you levels of badges one is like the verified by bloom bloom.pm slash badges description gives you like all the badges that people can get and then exactly what it means and what are appropriate like criteria for unlocking that badge. What this also does and what this also means we need to do is go through the bloom training framework and processes and pull out things like our work plan and pull out things like the activities and identify which of the criteria And to talk to you into those so that we integrate this new system with all of the stuff that we've been building. Okay. Yeah so instead of the arbitrariness of 100 teams going from 4.2 for 4.3 and a self-assessment of a reported skill and we might have to even say okay we took the absolute value because Because have to Because be careful. Because you have Because you have Even if they scored lower it just means that they got better at understanding their differences and it's just what the what the what this is good for so everyone knows that this was not a waste of time this data all this research first of all like if we look at what happened happened during XE 2 and the and the or is XE 1 XE 1 and the blast is that we learned that our programs actually support people to promote pro-symmatic growth we learned a lot of things because we had research but we had to kind of Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Qualify that we had to do the statistical methods we had to identify which factors were supportive and which factors were not supportive we had long form interviews and so this type of self-assessment was great for research but I don't think it's great for our teams to develop practical skills. We'll next week. We'll see next week. We'll see you next week. Was supposed to be helpful, but I think part, it was maybe 20% useless. So how can we make it just like really action-oriented, really concrete? Really simple and specific and it goes all the way down to like I need to learn this skill so I can make this output so I can get a verified badge so I can put it on my LinkedIn so I can get a job or I need to do all those things so I can be a better leader in my business. Like it all needs to add up and I feel like this is the time to do it. Umm so yeah the assessment should be fine or fast to do and it frames the programs umm self critiques you can see me critiquing myself but there's some really cool reasons so I wanted to show you guys this part like I mentioned. Connecting the E-S-E-S-C-O which is a huge ginormous framing of all the occupation skills and qualifications that is available in the EU and it's huge. Umm but what's really cool is here you can see how they connected EntraComp with the skills so if you go to page 7 these are these are all the skills in ESCO so S-1.1 negotiation, negotiating Thank you. Thank you. Nching contracts, responding to complaints, that's the tah. Umm and then what they made is well here's the EntraComp elements, the competencies and then here's how they lead to all of these different skills over here. Umm really cool and it's really practical and this the cool thing is after here you can actually even go over here and look at like different qualifications, different trainings, we can find different activities to develop very specific competencies and skills and you know they can bring it into their businesses or they can use it to get jobs. The other framing is rolls. So over here are all the rolls. So you can see there's meteorologists and chemists and it's very, very, very detailed, very, very detailed. Actors, I wonder if 25, 265",

So they're saying that mobilizing others is, oh no, it didn't fit all the way. 2652. Yeah. Good. 265. Wait, 265. Yeah, these are all 265s. So this is the more specific, the higher level role. So 265 is creative and performing arts. And I think it's kind of true actually. They say that creativity is responsible for it. . On it. That it fits into self-awareness and self-efficacy taking initiative and so on and so forth. So this is some of the pros for using Entrecomp and I thought I'd bring that up. But some critiques. If this is supposed to replace Top 6 place our universal skill, then we are missing an even newer element that they've developed called the life comp. And they're creating a bunch of comps actually. So if you want to see We'll you in next one. Life comp. Life comp has really they also have a green comp for sustainable competent, sustainability competencies. I think the foreword was the interesting part. But yeah they suggest that life comp is the crucial element for all the skills. They also created a digital competency for citizens, the entrepreneurial competency, there's the green competencies now and then there's the life comp. Life comp is more directly related to things that were mentioned before including the interdevelopment goals and the universal skills and some of the more soft soft skills. However you want to frame them. But what they're suggesting is that where is it? Baseline. That life comp is the baseline because if you see life comp has things like self-regulation, flexibility, well-being, empathy, communication, collaboration, growth mindset, critical thinking and managing learning . That before you go to any . . . The other competency frameworks, we need to have this as a basic. And so I think I kind of mentioned that here in my . . . . Yeah. See we decided to focus on . . . No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do I say it? Good. I did not say it. Okay, so I'll say it right now. So . . . Maybe we fork people very early. We do a very quick assessment either through an interview where someone kind of checks Thanks for watching. Some questions and checks whether or not they have the baseline for some of these things. I don't know how we would do it. Umm easiest, but before you get into my programs you should have the basics of life comp. Otherwise, we need to develop a life comp program uhh to be able to make sure that people have the basics. Umm baseline qualities that will support what do they call competencies to support them for the future stuff. Umm and of course I would recommend like I just did that we move towards badging that we move towards umm concrete verifiable uhh simple fast fun and useful. Useful. For participants assessments. Umm I wanted also to show that uhh other benefits of using Entrecomp is they've even though not a lot of people are using it and they know it. Umm they are already using the open badge framework uhh and they have Thanks watching! A bunch of Entrecomp badges there and they have this pocket guide for Entrep- aspiring entrepreneurs which has a description of Entrecomp and then even all these resources for each and every one of them. Of the elements. Into action you can have like a PDF online so entrepreneurial management. So these are the skills that you need umm this is a PDF that you can use and so this will help us really build out our umm uhh reflection to activity uhh. Quickly. And it will help us get grants with the EU in the future. So those are some of our thinking about the Anjokov. I wanted to walk you through a little bit of this because you could either read it or you can listen to this at 2x speed for 10 minutes. . Mm-hmm. This is the step one. It's gonna be in the beginning of the program. It's going to be just you know building out that that infrastructure for where this learning in a fit. Like what does it mean to be an uuh uuh uuh an uuh a leader for entrepreneurship. And then this is gonna be the reflection time. The part that we didn't get to. That I've started working on I called it observable activities. So these are potentially going to be the things like business plans, prioritize tasks in a project management simulation. So maybe you like take a screenshot of your Asana and your prioritization or or something. Like these are going to have to be reviewed and developed and already",

Umm tell you a little bit of our thinking. Show you how we're still using our assessment framework especially in the reflection elements. Umm but the fact that we're not going to have pre-post necessarily. Thanks, Sarah Lee. Umm as we used to with numbers but what I would recommend is for the observable activities it would be levels. So level. And this is going to be like 1, 2, 3. And you know if you have a basic Thanks again. If you plan 1, if you have a business plan with data coming in from you know outside resources directly from your Shopify webpage that might be a 3 and you take a screenshot of your Shopify webpage and how it fits into the diagram of your thing. So different levels of verification. And the kind of pre-post that we can do is immediately after the reflection see if we can get anything to bring them into a verifiable badge that we can give them. They can be level- basically they should have a verifiable one just level zero awareness right? Level one we could even include the reflection about what it means for them to be creative and how it can relate to business and then we can go up from there to further and further more valid and verifiable and yeah stronger developed skills so the beginning of the program would be you know they might be over here or even they might even be further along if they're developed at the end of the program they would be here but the main thing that we're showing funders is the page of badges that are verified we could even do like a LinkedIn search of just showing like how many people are adding these badges on LinkedIn and what they mean what it means that these things are exactly existing and the number that we want to see grow more and more is bloom verified PM and mentor badges out there. I didn't talk a lot about it, actually I don't know if you even mentioned it but I also want to encourage people to give each other badges but those don't necessarily need the badge. To be super validated or vetted it's more to encourage people to support each other it's like a shout out badge or it's like a badge for seeing somebody perform a skill. You and want to encourage them and people could still you know use these badges and put them around but they're not going to mean the same thing as a bloom verified badge with the link directly to the quality that we're looking for. Okay sorry the skill that we're looking for that has a . Output which is the learning by doing and the doing is making a thing creating a talisman that we put into the thing so that's it that's what we're thinking so far the place to give your feedback would be this one although even . Just talking through it like I realize we made some advancements since this document was written but it would be great to get your feedback over here and the feedback also could be done on the leadership for entrepreneurs awareness level so that one's this one over here and we're trying to get one question make it really fast you can review the questions you can also review the reflection level which we also gave some time one thing that we haven't done but it's really important is we want to write . A really good prompt here first before using GPT and then having GPT improve it but this is going to be an important thing they're going to fill in three questions and then they're going to ask for some reflection. Alright guys what do you think umm or didn't show you the platforms but there's open badges, passport and open badges to design badges. The passport already has an app people can just download it and start actually getting and receiving and it's going to be fun or they can just get it in their email basically we can even put it into You",

Ahmet, hey Munir. I wanted to request your review because we are moving forward on this assessment process for the Axi program and we really like your thought. I wanted to walk over some of our thinking kind of with a video just because I know that it might help clarify things a little bit better. It might be more fun hopefully and so I'm just gonna walk you through some of the documentation that we have ready for you. Or review and some of the thinking behind what we're doing.\n\nTransition from Individual Pillar Framework to Skills Builder Framework\nOkay, so we used to have a framework called the individual pillar and it had basically what is known as soft skills or 21st-century skills, universal skills, transversal skills, there's a million words. To describe it and we were using the skills builder framework that was coming from a kind of more high school oriented assessment and we weren't finding it very useful. And also a lot of the different assessments That's it. Hence that our self-reported we were getting issues. We were seeing that people actually reduce and score by the end of the program and that the assessment wasn't something that people were super excited to take at the end because it was not providing a lot of value. But we would need this information because it was what we were using for reporting. It was what we were kind of basing our assumption on that we could actually help people quote unquote grow and that this tool is measuring growth.\n\nChallenges with Current Assessment Methodology\nUmm, that is uhh That has proven to be difficult because the people when they take the assessment wind up getting a better awareness of the scope of their knowledge throughout the course of the program and are more appropriately scoring themselves at the end which makes it very messy. Not only that we don't know what people are meaning by a three for somebody umm uhh some people have different biases and of course there's statistical methods to kind of analyze that but that's a research project umm not necessarily something that we can use as like a pre-po stay let's like pull some dials move some levers umm and I've been we've been actually if you look into our certificate and credentials exploration we've been thinking about credentialing for a long time and as I started doing the research on Thanks watching!\n\nShifting to Skills Verification and Industry Trends\nSkills for leadership I realized that these are how HR departments are working now they are looking for practical observable verifiable ways to indicate that people have skills We are now at the umm the self-scoring and the assessments that's great but they are moving towards verifiable skills and they are using all sorts of things including AI games to kind of see how people respond rather than ask people to tell them something or even get a third party. So the industry is shifting towards skills verification including badges. So I thought let's catch up. And EntraComp actually has a badge document that they've umm the You uuh is the entrepreneurial competency framework. They actually put a lot of thinking into what exactly represents a skill and what is the competency and how is it helpful for developing entrepreneurial attitudes and not only that.\n\nBenefit of Developing Entrepreneurial Capacities\nThank much. They've in their research shown that these developments of entrepreneurial capacities isn't just making Europe and the rest of the world more like America. It's actually helpful for people to develop job skills and they've done a mapping that goes from entrepreneurial capacities to individuals. So you can see if I learn these things, if I'm good at these ultra competencies, these are the jobs I can get, and skills that are used in the European Union's validated skills framework for jobs and mobility. So people that have a skill in Spain, they validate it somehow and that skill is more transferable. So they've done a lot of thinking and they're aligning it really deeply across many countries and so I think it's a reasonable approach.\n\nImplementing a New Assessment Framework\nAnd for us as an entrepreneurial program, it's a great thing to work So, the decision to move away from self-reporting to this process that we're looking at as awareness, reflection, and validation. So awareness is just to know the lay of the land and it comes from this quote over here, recognition proceeds knowledge. It's basically a way to create the compartments in your mind to realize like oh so we're gonna be learning this, this new thing that I just saw, it fits into there. And then this other thing, it fits into there. And so we We are working on the awareness level assessment. It's going to be really fast and we're designing the program to incorporate these things in a more fun and smooth and uhh simple way rather than saying go home and take an assessment or like everyone pause and we're taking the assessment all together this is going to be on mentee meter this is going to be in real-time this is going to be at the end of the first boot camp session to give people the lay of the land and the beginning of the thinking of like okay.\n\nIntroducing the Badge System\n. What is leadership for entrepreneurs is that even a skill what is a skill what is a competency for like developing leadership well do you often think of new ways approach challenges do you take the lead taking the initiative so you just answer these questions true and false altogether and we show people kind of where we're strong as a community of people developing competencies leadership competencies for entrepreneurship then the idea proceeds from there to the reflection level you so umm taking the assessment and sharing a reflection this is where we get people to begin to the assessment and this goes to our platform now so we are developing it so that it's a Likert scale we're working looking up. On kind of finding like the minimum maximum for these umm elements from the Entra comp we also are working with the Entra comps reduced framework because there's something called the ECI Entra comps. Comp realized that nobody is actually using Entra comp and so they actually came up with the Entra comp implementation project the ECI and I think is that the URL for it?\n\n[Continued in the next message]\n\n\nUser\nContinue\n\nChatGPT\nECI's Objective and Practical Application\nYeah, here it is. So. The ECI's objective of operationalizing the Entra comp framework and they picked these six because they're they think are the most practical and operationalizable. So going from there we have chosen those sub-elements created activity, ethical, sustainable living, self-awareness, uhh self-efficacy, mobilizing others, taking the initiative, and coping with ambiguity and risk. And there's this assessment element where the important part is actually here. And and actually I think very importantly I miss an element.\n\nBadge System Implementation\nActually, after the awareness process, everyone gets a badge. And the everyone who who does the mentee, mentee meter slash other All right. Collaborative. Everyone who does this assessment in that collaborative tool will get their very first badges. So we actually begin from day one talking about badges talking about the fact that it actually gives them at the end. There are a lot of verifiable uhh ways of demonstrating skills because we're going to as bloom develop this badge means that this. But this is the beginning to help people learn about the badging tools and give them a very simple level zero or level one. I am aware of what it means to be an entrepreneurial leader. That's it. That's all it means and the verified thing for that is going to be the fact that they took the mentee meter. Maybe we like output the results of that with an email address or something.\n\nDeveloping Relevant and Insightful Questions\nOkay, so these are, so this is you know my thinking about the kinds of questions. It needs to be relevant to the competency. It needs to be fact-based. It needs to help like prompt insight. It needs to be progressive. Initially, I wanted We'll see you next week. I have questions for each. We changed our mind. I think I'm just gonna like remove that because we went down to just one question. We wanted to be fast. We wanted to be fun. We wanted to be on day one.\n\nIntegrating Learning Loop and Reflective Process\nOkay, so then the reflection element. We're gonna use the Likert over here and so what we're doing is after the awareness element there's this element of the learning loop where people are reflecting or integrating new knowledge and then this part is the doing part. This is the cool thing about the learning by doing is that usually the doing comes with outcomes.\n\nOutcome-Driven Learning Approach\nAll right. Thank you. All right. So it's going to be a presentation that they recorded on loom or it's going to be a worksheet for their business model or it's going to be they filled out something or they they even did a phone call maybe they record the audio but the doing is going to be here and then of course it goes back. I with with the reflection but these results in the verifiable badges that we need to get very clear on what it means for someone to be a level one creative entrepreneurial leader. What does it mean for someone to be a level two creative entrepreneur or leader? And each of those things will have different verification criteria.\n\nSetting Clear Verification Criteria\nSo it's another one of those things where we add a framing. We tell people in order to get creative level two. Thank you. Umm, we need to see you exhibiting X, Y, and Z skills. So this is something that we have not done yet. We are working on doing that next. So we're moving from framing and developing the thinking beyond umm the self-reported assessments into a the United the longest the United States in In the investment that is uhh useful for the people that take it no matter if they get into the program they don't get into the program they'll have something and what's really cool is actually using open badges 2.0 it can go directly into Linkedin.\n\nLeveraging Open Badges 2.0 for LinkedIn Integration\nSo if they have a badge they can umm upload it into Linkedin and umm I was suggesting we actually make the badge saying like uhh what does this mean click me find more you know it has creative leader at level 0 and they click it and then it will actually give them uhh what it means so you know you go into Thanks for watching! Linkedin you say someone says they're a creative leader but then you click and you open it up and it's like oh my god this is their whole portfolio of like here's the frameworks that they have developed themselves for how to have divergence and convergent thinking whatever it is so it's gonna have to have a very specific thing and that's gonna be Thank you. Really cool work that hopefully we'll do in the month of February and then the reasoning keep the entrepreneurs in the driver's seat this we already talked the reasoning behind why we're moving the structure from self-reporting or even third party reporting or even psychometric assessments that try to like get at something from trying regulation to something that's more concrete and practical awareness raising developing this reflective process and creating evidence that they can take with them because we're learning by doing system this really makes a lot of sense to me and it resolves the issue of slippage Thanks for watching!\n\nConclusion and Call for Feedback\nUmm it gives them out of the territory uhh and it gives them power to give informal badges yeah so also using these open badging tools umm what I would like people to do is incentivize so we still use the leaderboard but incentivize people to give each other badges when they see them see people displaying those skills so for instance umm we ask a question and then somebody answers the question first we could even prompt them to say hey uhh does anybody see somebody taking initiative is that a leadership scheme? Skill? You know? And uhh who's gonna give this person their badge first umm the badging systems are quite simple uhh and there are even tools that let us use something like google uhh forms to create a badge so we can say here's the form for giving each other badges and so people kind of get too you levels of badges one is like the verified by bloom bloom.pm slash badges description gives you like all the badges that people can get and then exactly what it means and what are appropriate like criteria for unlocking that badge. What this also does and what this also means we need to do is go through the bloom training framework and processes and pull out things like our work plan and pull out things like the activities and identify which of the criteria And to talk to you into those so that we integrate this new system with all of the stuff that we've been building. Okay. Yeah so instead of the arbitrariness of 100 teams going from 4.2 for 4.3 and a self-assessment of a reported skill and we might have to even say okay we took the absolute value because Because have to Because be careful. Because you have Because you have Even if they scored lower it just means that they got better at understanding their differences and it's just what the what the what this is good for so everyone knows that this was not a waste of time this data all this research first of all like if we look at what happened happened during XE 2 and the and the or is XE 1 XE 1 and the blast is that we learned that our programs actually support people to promote pro-symmatic growth we learned a lot of things because we had research but we had to kind of Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Qualify that we had to do the statistical methods we had to identify which factors were supportive and which factors were not supportive we had long form interviews and so this type of self-assessment was great for research but I don't think it's great for our teams to develop practical skills. We'll next week. We'll see next week. We'll see you next week. Was supposed to be helpful, but I think part, it was maybe 20% useless. So how can we make it just like really action-oriented, really concrete? Really simple and specific and it goes all the way down to like I need to learn this skill so I can make this output so I can get a verified badge so I can put it on my LinkedIn so I can get a job or I need to do all those things so I can be a better leader in my business. Like it all needs to add up and I feel like this is the time to do it. Umm so yeah the assessment should be fine or fast to do and it frames the programs umm self critiques you can see me critiquing myself but there's some really cool reasons so I wanted to show you guys this part like I mentioned. Connecting the E-S-E-S-C-O which is a huge ginormous framing of all the occupation skills and qualifications that is available in the EU and it's huge. Umm but what's really cool is here you can see how they connected EntraComp with the skills so if you go to page 7 these are these are all the skills in ESCO so S-1.1 negotiation, negotiating Thank you. Thank you. Nching contracts, responding to complaints, that's the tah. Umm and then what they made is well here's the EntraComp elements, the competencies and then here's how they lead to all of these different skills over here. Umm really cool and it's really practical and this the cool thing is after here you can actually even go over here and look at like different qualifications, different trainings, we can find different activities to develop very specific competencies and skills and you know they can bring it into their businesses or they can use it to get jobs. The other framing is rolls. So over here are all the rolls. So you can see there's meteorologists and chemists and it's very, very, very detailed, very, very detailed. Actors, I wonder if 25, 265, We'll week. We'll week. We'll week. We'll see We'll see is available for anything in actual comp. Ah, it doesn't look like it. Uhh, musicians. Oh yeah, it's here. Okay. So they're saying that mobilizing others is, oh no, it didn't fit all the way. 2652. Yeah. Good. 265. Wait, 265. Yeah, these are all 265s. So this is the more specific, the higher level role. So 265 is creative and performing arts. And I think it's kind of true actually. They say that creativity is responsible for it. . On it. That it fits into self-awareness and self-efficacy taking initiative and so on and so forth. So this is some of the pros for using Entrecomp and I thought I'd bring that up. But some critiques. If this is supposed to replace Top 6 place our universal skill, then we are missing an even newer element that they've developed called the life comp. And they're creating a bunch of comps actually. So if you want to see We'll you in next one. Life comp. Life comp has really they also have a green comp for sustainable competent, sustainability competencies. I think the foreword was the interesting part. But yeah they suggest that life comp is the crucial element for all the skills. They also created a digital competency for citizens, the entrepreneurial competency, there's the green competencies now and then there's the life comp. Life comp is more directly related to things that were mentioned before including the interdevelopment goals and the universal skills and some of the more soft soft skills. However you want to frame them. But what they're suggesting is that where is it? Baseline. That life comp is the baseline because if you see life comp has things like self-regulation, flexibility, well-being, empathy, communication, collaboration, growth mindset, critical thinking and managing learning . That before you go to any . . . The other competency frameworks, we need to have this as a basic. And so I think I kind of mentioned that here in my . . . . Yeah. See we decided to focus on . . . No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Do I say it? Good. I did not say it. Okay, so I'll say it right now. So . . . Maybe we fork people very early. We do a very quick assessment either through an interview where someone kind of checks Thanks for watching. Some questions and checks whether or not they have the baseline for some of these things. I don't know how we would do it. Umm easiest, but before you get into my programs you should have the basics of life comp. Otherwise, we need to develop a life comp program uhh to be able to make sure that people have the basics. Umm baseline qualities that will support what do they call competencies to support them for the future stuff. Umm and of course I would recommend like I just did that we move towards badging that we move towards umm concrete verifiable uhh simple fast fun and useful. Useful. For participants assessments. Umm I wanted also to show that uhh other benefits of using Entrecomp is they've even though not a lot of people are using it and they know it. Umm they are already using the open badge framework uhh and they have Thanks watching! A bunch of Entrecomp badges there and they have this pocket guide for Entrep- aspiring entrepreneurs which has a description of Entrecomp and then even all these resources for each and every one of them. Of the elements. Into action you can have like a PDF online so entrepreneurial management. So these are the skills that you need umm this is a PDF that you can use and so this will help us really build out our umm uhh reflection to activity uhh. Quickly. And it will help us get grants with the EU in the future. So those are some of our thinking about the Anjokov. I wanted to walk you through a little bit of this because you could either read it or you can listen to this at 2x speed for 10 minutes. . Mm-hmm. This is the step one. It's gonna be in the beginning of the program. It's going to be just you know building out that that infrastructure for where this learning in a fit. Like what does it mean to be an uuh uuh uuh an uuh a leader for entrepreneurship. And then this is gonna be the reflection time. The part that we didn't get to. That I've started working on I called it observable activities. So these are potentially going to be the things like business plans, prioritize tasks in a project management simulation. So maybe you like take a screenshot of your Asana and your prioritization or or something. Like these are going to have to be reviewed and developed and already aligned with stuff inside of our framework aligned with the stuff inside of the the aspiring entrepreneurs thing. Those are our next steps. I just wanted to get you a big overview. Umm tell you a little bit of our thinking. Show you how we're still using our assessment framework especially in the reflection elements. Umm but the fact that we're not going to have pre-post necessarily. Thanks, Sarah Lee. Umm as we used to with numbers but what I would recommend is for the observable activities it would be levels. So level. And this is going to be like 1, 2, 3. And you know if you have a basic Thanks again. If you plan 1, if you have a business plan with data coming in from you know outside resources directly from your Shopify webpage that might be a 3 and you take a screenshot of your Shopify webpage and how it fits into the diagram of your thing. So different levels of verification. And the kind of pre-post that we can do is immediately after the reflection see if we can get anything to bring them into a verifiable badge that we can give them. They can be level- basically they should have a verifiable one just level zero awareness right? Level one we could even include the reflection about what it means for them to be creative and how it can relate to business and then we can go up from there to further and further more valid and verifiable and yeah stronger developed skills so the beginning of the program would be you know they might be over here or even they might even be further along if they're developed at the end of the program they would be here but the main thing that we're showing funders is the page of badges that are verified we could even do like a LinkedIn search of just showing like how many people are adding these badges on LinkedIn and what they mean what it means that these things are exactly existing and the number that we want to see grow more and more is bloom verified PM and mentor badges out there. I didn't talk a lot about it, actually I don't know if you even mentioned it but I also want to encourage people to give each other badges but those don't necessarily need the badge. To be super validated or vetted it's more to encourage people to support each other it's like a shout out badge or it's like a badge for seeing somebody perform a skill. You and want to encourage them and people could still you know use these badges and put them around but they're not going to mean the same thing as a bloom verified badge with the link directly to the quality that we're looking for. Okay sorry the skill that we're looking for that has a . Output which is the learning by doing and the doing is making a thing creating a talisman that we put into the thing so that's it that's what we're thinking so far the place to give your feedback would be this one although even . Just talking through it like I realize we made some advancements since this document was written but it would be great to get your feedback over here and the feedback also could be done on the leadership for entrepreneurs awareness level so that one's this one over here and we're trying to get one question make it really fast you can review the questions you can also review the reflection level which we also gave some time one thing that we haven't done but it's really important is we want to write . A really good prompt here first before using GPT and then having GPT improve it but this is going to be an important thing they're going to fill in three questions and then they're going to ask for some reflection. Alright guys what do you think umm or didn't show you the platforms but there's open badges, passport and open badges to design badges. The passport already has an app people can just download it and start actually getting and receiving and it's going to be fun or they can just get it in their email basically we can even put it into You",

The primary focus is on transitioning from traditional assessment methods to a more dynamic and practical approach, emphasizing the development of entrepreneurial skills and competencies. The new system aims to align with current industry trends, particularly in skills verification, and leverages technological advancements for a more engaging and effective learning experience.\n\n**Introduction**\nBilal addresses Ahmet and Munir to review the proposed advancements in the Axi program's assessment process. He emphasizes the need for their input and outlines the intention to clarify and enhance the program's approach through this new initiative.\n\n**From Traditional to Innovative Assessment**\n- **Transitioning Frameworks:** The shift from the Individual Pillar Framework to the Skills Builder Framework is discussed. The inadequacies of the former in accurately assessing and reporting soft skills and personal growth are highlighted.\n- **Challenges with Current Methodologies:** The existing assessment methods are critiqued for their lack of practical utility and effectiveness. Issues such as inaccurate self-reporting and the inability to capture genuine growth are noted.\n\n**Adopting New Industry Trends**\n- **Skills Verification Focus:** Bilal points to a paradigm shift in HR departments, where there's an increasing preference for observable, verifiable skills over self-reported abilities. This includes the use of AI and games in assessments.\n- **Integration of EntraComp Framework:** The entrepreneurial competency framework, EntraComp, is introduced as a model for developing relevant entrepreneurial skills and attitudes. Its comprehensive approach to skill and competency mapping aligns well with the program's objectives.\n\n**Implementation of the New Assessment Framework**\n- **Awareness, Reflection, Validation Process:** The new framework focuses on three core aspects – awareness of skills, reflection on learning, and validation of competencies. This approach is designed to be engaging, interactive, and more in line with real-world skill application.\n- **Badge System Introduction:** A badge system is implemented to recognize and validate various competencies. This system starts from the awareness stage and integrates with real-time assessment tools like Mentee Meter.\n\n**Enhancing Learning with Technology**\n- **Incorporation of Open Badges 2.0:** The use of Open Badges 2.0 facilitates the integration of earned badges with professional platforms like LinkedIn, enhancing visibility and recognition of skills.\n- **Leveraging Digital Platforms:** The use of digital platforms is emphasized for creating, distributing, and verifying badges. This approach aims to make the learning process more accessible and engaging.\n\n**Outcome-Driven Learning and Skill Verification**\n- **Practical Application of Skills:** The new system emphasizes the practical application of skills through observable activities, such as business plans or project simulations.\n- **Clear Criteria for Skill Levels:** Different levels of skill and competency are established, each with clear criteria for verification. This structured approach aims to provide tangible outcomes and clear progression paths for learners.\n\n**Continuous Improvement and Feedback Mechanism**\n- **Seeking Feedback for Refinement:** The document concludes with a call for feedback on the proposed system. This feedback is crucial for the continuous improvement and adaptation of the assessment process.\n- **Future Integration with Comprehensive Skills Frameworks:** Plans for future integration with broader competency frameworks, like Life Comp and Green Comp, are also mentioned. This integration aims to ensure that the program remains comprehensive and aligned with global competency standards.\n\nIn summary, Bilal's proposed system represents a significant shift towards a more interactive, practical, and technology-integrated approach to skill assessment and development. This new methodology aligns with current industry standards and prepares learners more effectively for real-world challenges.",
