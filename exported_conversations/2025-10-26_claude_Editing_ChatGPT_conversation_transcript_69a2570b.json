  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user uploaded a text file containing a ChatGPT conversation that had become formatted as an unreadable wall of text, with all paragraph breaks removed. They were frustrated with the poor formatting that killed readability. Claude identified the issue and took action to restore proper paragraph structure to what appeared to be Chapter 6 of a larger work titled \"Maaristan.\"\n\nClaude reformatted the text by adding appropriate paragraph breaks that followed natural thought transitions, creating a more readable flow. The content discussed Islamic historical medical institutions (maristans), virtue-based care practices, therapeutic relationships, and integrated approaches to medicine and psychology that blend empirical methods with spiritual considerations. The text included Arabic terminology and Islamic concepts throughout.\n\nClaude created a properly formatted output file and provided feedback on the structure, noting how the paragraph breaks now followed logical thought shifts from historical foundation through theological reflection to cultural critique and philosophical synthesis. Claude also offered a constructive suggestion about a potential transition issue between expressing skepticism about certain medical claims while remaining open to the transformative power of practitioner presence, noting this might need smoother bridging or could be intentionally contrastive.\n\n**Tool Knowledge**\n\nClaude used the view tool to read the uploaded text file from `/mnt/user-data/uploads/` and the create_file tool to generate a formatted output at `/mnt/user-data/outputs/chapter6_formatted.txt`. The approach of reading the source material first, identifying the formatting issues, then creating a clean output file with restored paragraph structure proved effective for text formatting tasks. The file path structure shows uploads go to a user-data/uploads directory while outputs are saved to user-data/outputs, maintaining clear separation between source and processed materials.",

Somehow, the most important thing isn’t the physical molecule interaction that matters, it’s the… metaphysical presence that transforms. I am not yet converted. Some things that give credence to the idea for me are the hadith of the Prophet (S) asking his sahaba, who had developed an impromptu sort of healing method (rukya) by reciting suratul Fatiha on the ailing person, how they had come up with that method, and then praising them for it. As well as knowing that Allah (swt) is ultimately the shafi and we are here attempting to open up channels of asbab (ways/methods). The sunnatullah, in my understanding, is simply a pattern that God (swt) allows as a mercy for us, such that we can have a usually predictable and consistent life, and also to support and promote the ultimate ends and desires for God (swt) to show us his mercy and care, and to bring us closer to him. \n    15\t\n    16\t\n    17\t\n    18\tA sunnah of life could have been that as we age we do not go through a bell curve, that we get older, healthier, our immune system sees more pathogens and gets stronger and soon we no longer fall ill, we continue to grow in strength and intelligence, etc, and then at the age of 63+, we can have a collapse of our system and we die. Except that’s not how God intended it for us. He promised us pain and difficulty, particularly for those he loves. Aging is simply a sign of his mercy if he allows it for you. We start to recognize weakness, need and experience various age-related difficulties that allow us to develop in humility, mercy towards others, patience, and turning back towards God(swt). \n    19\t\n    20\t\n    21\t\n\t< truncated lines 22-90 >\n    91\t\n    92\tThoughts reflecting on Ibn Rushd and philosophy:\n    93\t\n    94\tThe idea that philosophy is about contemplating existence connects with the idea of 3lm al Nafs (study of the self) and the encouragement for “reading” the signs. Signs exist within ourselves, within the world, and within the Holy Book. Signs are āyāt that we can string together with our capacity for interpretation. This, to me, is the creative act of “iqra,” reading. We are given the ultimate boundary—that all must be seen through the lens of Ultimate Mercy—and any interpretation other than that is incorrect, though it is possible to identify this if we live a long life and heal from our inner conflicts and the psychological distortions that come from neglectful parenting (even the best of parents will have some challenges with their children). This aligns with ideas from other traditions that speak of “seeing reality as it is”—both from religious (Buddhist) and secular (scientific) lenses. The benefit Muslims have in working to see inwardly more clearly (with tazkiyyat al-nafs) is that the outer world can thus be seen and interpreted more clearly, and, thankfully, we have a clear rubric—a furqan—to help guide us with our interpretation, a guidance for mankind. This framing of our epistemology as being flawed as long as we are not completely free from inner distortions is helpful, at least for me, in knowing another deeply important reason Islamic psychology is of ultimate concern: it’s a mechanism to aid more people in seeing the world as it truly is and to become a walking Qur’an.\n    95\t\n    96\tI think perhaps the other author you asked us to reflect on says it better, and more coherently: “Our purpose in writing this book is to equip ourselves with manners that lead to the most beautiful actions … And the path to this is to first know our self….”\n    97\t\n    98\tYou said:\n    99\tOk, can you clean it up a tiny bit more some things are sort of all over the place, maybe you can do two paragraphs, one as it was just edited, and then the one below restructured a bit and better organized to be more coherent and less rambly while still sounding like me\n   100\tChatGPT said:\n   101\t\n   102\tGot it—here are two versions.

Second is a slightly reorganized pass that keeps your voice but reads more coherently.\n   103\t\n   104\t1) Lightly cleaned (same structure/voice):\n   105\tChapter 6 — Maaristan. The maristans of the past set a standard for an inclusive and altruistic treatment team (see Chapters 3 and 4). The explicit criteria of akhlāq (i.e., virtue and morality) served as an expectation of the care team and a primary requirement for employment in Islamic hospitals; a team’s akhlāq was expected not only while administering professional care but also in their personal lives (Altintas, 2022; Ünver, 1939). This unique emphasis on virtuous behaviour differentiated Islamic medicine in its humane approach and was crucial to the maristans’ medical and administrative success (Dols, 1992; Mitha, 2020). I’m interested in reviewing these papers: nevertheless, it deserves attention—especially since empirical evidence shows that the quality of the therapeutic relationship itself (Baier et al., 2020; Norcross & Lambert, 2019; Weck et al., 2015) and the personal characteristics of the clinician (Heinonen et al., 2012; Heinonen & Nissen-Lie, 2020) may influence the success of therapeutic processes regardless of the specific methods used. Colloquially it’s said—without much explanation or evidence—“It doesn’t matter what you do; it matters how you do it.” Is that true? How do we know it’s true? Reflecting on this reminds me of some of the things we’re discussing with Dr. Mazen, particularly the idea of homeopathy: somehow the most important thing isn’t the physical molecule interaction; it’s the… metaphysical presence that transforms. I am not yet converted. What gives this idea some credence for me is the hadith of the Prophet (S) asking his sahaba—who had developed an impromptu healing method (ruqyah) by reciting Sūrat al-Fātiha over an ailing person—how they came up with it, and then praising them. And we know that Allah (swt) is ultimately al-Shāfī, while we are here attempting to open channels of asbāb (means). The sunnatullāh, in my understanding, is the pattern God (swt) allows as a mercy so we can have a usually predictable life, and so He may show us His mercy and bring us closer to Him. A sunnah of life could have been that aging doesn’t follow a bell curve—that we just keep getting stronger and smarter until 63+, then collapse and die—but that’s not how God intended it. He promised us pain and difficulty, particularly for those He loves. Aging can be a sign of His mercy, allowing us to recognize weakness and need, develop humility, mercy, patience, and turn back to God (swt). Connecting this to why practitioners must develop their akhlāq: ultimate healing is to acknowledge the Prophet (S)’s recognition—paraphrased—that everything benefits the believer: if it’s good and they’re grateful, they are increased; if it’s bad and they’re patient, they’re rewarded. This happens best when practitioners care for their spiritual health—making wudu’ before an interaction and praying for their patients—offering windows for asbāb that are less interventionist without breaking the sunan of Allah (swt). For instance, after praying for a patient and seeing quick recovery, we have something empirical, though highly contextual and dependent on seen and unseen factors. I’m reminded of a doctor who used to do ruqyah and read al-Fātiha for patients and they were cured; his protégé took his place after he passed, and people would still come, and he’d say, in effect: “I’m doing the same thing, and I am not my teacher…” This multi-faceted, holistic exploration of natural-law asbāb and the sunan of Allah (swt), alongside inward spiritual work, feels critical not just for healing an individual coming to a maristān. The “Don’t Die”/life-extension movement and the framing of death as a disease seem to produce cancer-like tendencies in humanity: a refusal to die can be a refusal to meet your Maker, to make way for the next generation, to admit defeat when “lā ghāliba illā Allāh”—there is no ultimate victor except Allah (SWT). We see social tensions—from Japan to France to the US—between “baby boomers” and younger generations over wealth, pensions, and leadership, plus declining birth rates, perhaps tied to precarity and constriction when one anticipates a long life with limited income (setting aside the individualism many societies embrace). Of all the “medicines” people have shared online, two consistently show high returns for mental/physical health and wellbeing: (1) sleep (those who accept decree and death sleep soundest ;D), and (2) strong social relations—being needed and needing. These should be used alongside historically grounded, newly emerging tools. The maristān model of care advocates an open approach to novel clinical practices, enabling a wide range of applied tools for truly integrative care. One tension I’m holding is the evidence-based requirement. While the textbook recommends adopting modern evidence-based methods, the replication crisis in the social sciences, including psychology, makes me wary. It feels like diet waves—Atkins, paleo, xyz—coming and going, with different people getting different results. I believe muraqabah (attending to/being with) a patient is ultimately important; presence itself is healing, alongside medicines and interventions—things extremely hard to quantify. Perhaps a qualitative science of healing is the best we can do for psychology? Like diets, newer explanations point to individual differences—genetics, gut microbiome, mood, time of day, movement, sun exposure, food sequencing, etc. In psychology, evidence-based research may need to account for physical and metaphysical “microbiomes”—who knows what seen and unseen forces are at play, for harm or benefit. Thoughts on Ibn Rushd and philosophy: philosophy as contemplation of existence connects with ʿilm al-nafs (study of the self) and the encouragement to “read” the signs—within ourselves, the world, and the Holy Book. These āyāt can be strung together through interpretation; that creative act is iqra—reading. Our interpretive boundary is Ultimate Mercy; anything outside that is off. With a long life and healing from inner conflicts and distortions (even the best parents leave us some), we can see more clearly. This aligns with other traditions that speak of “seeing reality as it is” (religious and secular). As Muslims, the more we purify inwardly (tazkiyat al-nafs), the more clearly we see and interpret the outer world, and we have a rubric—furqān—to guide us. Framing our epistemology as necessarily flawed until we’re free of inner distortions clarifies why Islamic psychology matters: it helps more people see the world as it truly is and become a walking Qur’an. As another author you asked us to reflect on puts it, more coherently: “Our purpose in writing this book is to equip ourselves with manners that lead to the most beautiful actions… And the path to this is to first know our self….”\n   106\t\n   107\t2) Restructured (same voice, clearer arc):\n   108\tChapter 6 — Maaristan. Maristans modeled care rooted in akhlāq—virtue as both hiring criterion and daily practice (Altintas, 2022; Ünver, 1939)—and that moral center seems to explain much of their humane and administrative success (Dols, 1992; Mitha, 2020). Modern research echoes this: outcomes often track the quality of the therapeutic relationship and the clinician’s personal qualities (Baier et al., 2020; Norcross & Lambert, 2019; Weck et al., 2015; Heinonen et al., 2012; Heinonen & Nissen-Lie, 2020). So the saying “It doesn’t matter what you do; it matters how you do it” keeps ringing in my ears. I’m not sold on claims like homeopathy, but I’m open to the idea that presence can transform. The Prophet (S) praised companions who used ruqyah with al-Fātiha; ultimately al-Shāfī heals, and we open channels of asbāb within the sunnatullāh—the merciful patterns God (swt) allows. Aging itself can be mercy: weakness and need grow humility, compassion, patience, and return us to God. That’s why practitioner akhlāq matters—wudu’, duʿā’, and sincere care create non-intrusive windows for asbāb without breaking the sunan of Allah; sometimes results look empirical, yet remain deeply contextual and contingent on seen and unseen factors (like the doctor of ruqyah whose student “did the same” but wasn’t the same). Culturally, an obsession with “Don’t Die”/life-extension can shade into a refusal to meet our Maker or make way for others—“lā ghāliba illā Allāh.” We can feel the social drag (boomers vs. younger cohorts, pensions, leadership) and even the chill on birthrates. Meanwhile, two “medicines” consistently help: sleep and strong social ties. So a maristān today should be open to new tools while rooted in wisdom. Yes, “evidence-based” matters, but the replication crisis urges humility; like diets, responses differ by genetics, microbiome, mood, movement, sunlight, timing, and more—maybe psychology needs a qualitative core and a broader lens that includes physical and metaphysical “microbiomes.” Ibn Rushd helps here: philosophy as contemplation of existence meets ʿilm al-nafs and the Qur’anic call to iqra—to read signs within the self, the world, and Revelation—always through the boundary of Mercy and guided by furqān. The more we purify (tazkiyat al-nafs), the clearer we see; that’s one reason Islamic psychology matters: helping us see reality as it is and, God-willing, become walking Qur’ans. As another author says: “Our purpose in writing this book is to equip ourselves with manners that lead to the most beautiful actions… and the path to this is to first know our self….”\n   109\t\n   110\tYou said:\n   111\twhere did all the line breaks go, it's one giant block",

It\\u2019s possibly similar to the issue with diets, recently some that have attemtped to understand why it is that different people have different results from the same diets have come forward with explanations pointing at differences in genetic disposition, microbiome in the gut, mood, time of day, movement, sun exposure, sequencing of food, etc. In psychology our evidence based research might need to account for physical and metaphysical \\u201cmicrobiomes\\u201d - who knows what seen and unseen forces are at play both for ill and for benefit. \\n\\n\\n\\nThoughts reflecting on Ibn Rushd and philosophy:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe idea that philosophy is about contemplating about existance connects iwth the idea of 3lm al Nafs (study of the self) - and the encouragement for \\u201creading\\u201d the signs.

We are given the ultimate boundary, that all must be seen through the lens of Ultimate Mercy, and any interpretation other than that is incorrect, while it is possible to identify this if we live a long life and heal from our inner conflicts and the psychological distortions that neglectful parenting (even the best of parents will have some challenges with their children). This aligns with the ideas from othe traditions which speak of \\u201cseeing reality as it is\\u201d - both from religious (budhist) and secular (scientific) lenses. The benefit muslims have in working to see inwardly more clearly (with tazkiyyatul nafs), the outerworld can thus be seen and interpretted more clearly, and, thankfully, we have a clear rubric, a furqan, to help guide us with our interpretation, a guidance for mankind. This framing of our epsitemology as being flawed as long as we are not completely free from inner distortions is helpful, at least for me, in knowing another deeply important reason islamic psychology is of ultimate concern, it\\u2019s a mechanism to aid more people in seeing the world as it truely is and to become a walking Quran. \\n\\n\\n\\nI think perhaps the other author you asked us to reflect on says it better, and perhaps more coherently: \\n\\n\\u201cOur purpose in writing this book is to equip ourselves with manners that lead to the most beautiful actions \\u2026 And the path to this is to first know our self\\u2026.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n]]]\\nYou can also get rid of extra double enters\\n\\nChatGPT said:\\nThought for 29s\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a lightly edited version with spelling/grammar tightened and extra blank lines removed, while keeping your voice:\\n\\nChapter 6 \\u2014 Maaristan\\n\\nInitial reflections and standout passages: \\u201cThe maristans of the past set a standard for an inclusive and altruistic treatment team (see Chapters 3 and 4). The explicit criteria of akhl\\u0101q (i.e., virtue and morality) served as an expectation of the care team and a primary requirement for employment in Islamic hospitals. A team\\u2019s akhl\\u0101q was not only expected while administering professional care but also in their personal lives (Altintas, 2022; \\u00dcnver, 1939). Such a unique emphasis on virtuous behaviour differentiated Islamic medicine in its humane approach and was crucial to the maristans\\u2019 medical and administrative success (Dols, 1992; Mitha, 2020).\\u201d\\n\\nI\\u2019m interested in reviewing these papers: nevertheless, it deserves attention, especially since empirical evidence shows that the quality of the therapeutic relationship itself (Baier et al., 2020; Norcross & Lambert, 2019; Weck et al., 2015) and the personal characteristics of the clinician (Heinonen et al., 2012; Heinonen & Nissen-Lie, 2020) may influence the success of therapeutic processes regardless of the specific methods used.\\n\\nColloquially it is said\\u2014without explanation or evidence\\u2014that: \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t matter what you do; it matters how you do it.\\u201d Is that true? How do we know it\\u2019s true? Reflecting on this reminds me of some of the things we\\u2019re talking about with Dr. Mazen, particularly the idea of homeopathy. Somehow, the most important thing isn\\u2019t the physical molecule interaction; it\\u2019s the\\u2026 metaphysical presence that transforms. I am not yet converted. Some things that give credence to the idea for me are the hadith of the Prophet (S) asking his sahaba, who had developed an impromptu sort of healing method (ruqyah) by reciting S\\u016brat al-F\\u0101tiha over the ailing person, how they had come up with that method, and then praising them for it. As well as knowing that Allah (swt) is ultimately the Shafi and we are here attempting to open up channels of asb\\u0101b (ways/methods). The sunnatullah, in my understanding, is simply a pattern that God (swt) allows as a mercy for us, such that we can have a usually predictable and consistent life, and also to support and promote the ultimate ends and desires for God (swt) to show us His mercy and care, and to bring us closer to Him.\\n\\nA sunnah of life could have been that, as we age, we do not go through a bell curve\\u2014that we get older, healthier, our immune system sees more pathogens and gets stronger, and soon we no longer fall ill; we continue to grow in strength and intelligence, etc., and then at the age of 63+, we have a collapse of our system and die. Except that\\u2019s not how God intended it for us. He promised us pain and difficulty, particularly for those He loves. Aging is simply a sign of His mercy if He allows it for you. We start to recognize weakness and need, and we experience various age-related difficulties that allow us to develop humility, mercy towards others, patience, and turning back towards God (swt).\\n\\nConnecting this to why our practitioners must also take it upon themselves to develop their akhl\\u0101q might be because the ultimate healing is to acknowledge the Prophet (S)\\u2019s recognition, in a brief paraphrase, that everything in the end is of benefit for the believer: if it\\u2019s good and they are grateful, they are increased; and if it\\u2019s bad and they are patient, they are rewarded. This happens best when the practitioner themselves is taking care of their spiritual health, making wudu\\u2019 before an interaction and praying for their patients. This offers windows for asb\\u0101b that are less interventionist without breaking the sunan of Allah (swt) for having asb\\u0101b. For instance, after praying for their patient and the patient recovering quickly, we have empirical evidence of what works\\u2014although it must be noted that it is highly contextualized and dependent on seen and unseen factors. I am reminded of a doctor who used to do ruqyah and treat his patients and read al-F\\u0101tiha for them, and they would be cured. His prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 and student took his place when he passed away, and people would still come, and he would say, in effect: \\u201cI\\u2019m doing the same thing, and I am not my teacher\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\nThis multi-faceted, holistic exploration of natural-law \\u201casb\\u0101b\\u201d and the \\u201csunan of Allah (swt),\\u201d as well as more inward and spiritual work, seems to me to be something critical not simply for the healing of an individual coming to a marist\\u0101n. The movements towards \\u201cDon\\u2019t Die\\u201d and life-extension and viewing death as a disease are demonstrating cancer-like behaviors for humanity. A refusal to die is a refusal to meet your Maker, to make way for the next generation, to admit defeat when \\u201cl\\u0101 gh\\u0101liba ill\\u0101 All\\u0101h\\u201d\\u2014there is no one who is ultimately successful except Allah (SWT).

We see social tensions\\u2014from Japan to France to the US\\u2014between \\u201cbaby boomers\\u201d and younger generations over wealth, pensions, and leadership, plus declining birth rates, perhaps tied to precarity and constriction when one anticipates a long life with limited income (setting aside the individualism many societies embrace). Of all the \\u201cmedicines\\u201d people have shared online, two consistently show high returns for mental/physical health and wellbeing: (1) sleep (those who accept decree and death sleep soundest ;D), and (2) strong social relations\\u2014being needed and needing. These should be used alongside historically grounded, newly emerging tools. The marist\\u0101n model of care advocates an open approach to novel clinical practices, enabling a wide range of applied tools for truly integrative care. One tension I\\u2019m holding is the evidence-based requirement. While the textbook recommends adopting modern evidence-based methods, the replication crisis in the social sciences, including psychology, makes me wary. It feels like diet waves\\u2014Atkins, paleo, xyz\\u2014coming and going, with different people getting different results. I believe muraqabah (attending to/being with) a patient is ultimately important; presence itself is healing, alongside medicines and interventions\\u2014things extremely hard to quantify. Perhaps a qualitative science of healing is the best we can do for psychology? Like diets, newer explanations point to individual differences\\u2014genetics, gut microbiome, mood, time of day, movement, sun exposure, food sequencing, etc. In psychology, evidence-based research may need to account for physical and metaphysical \\u201cmicrobiomes\\u201d\\u2014who knows what seen and unseen forces are at play, for harm or benefit. Thoughts on Ibn Rushd and philosophy: philosophy as contemplation of existence connects with \\u02bfilm al-nafs (study of the self) and the encouragement to \\u201cread\\u201d the signs\\u2014within ourselves, the world, and the Holy Book. These \\u0101y\\u0101t can be strung together through interpretation; that creative act is iqra\\u2014reading. Our interpretive boundary is Ultimate Mercy; anything outside that is off. With a long life and healing from inner conflicts and distortions (even the best parents leave us some), we can see more clearly. This aligns with other traditions that speak of \\u201cseeing reality as it is\\u201d (religious and secular). As Muslims, the more we purify inwardly (tazkiyat al-nafs), the more clearly we see and interpret the outer world, and we have a rubric\\u2014furq\\u0101n\\u2014to guide us. Framing our epistemology as necessarily flawed until we\\u2019re free of inner distortions clarifies why Islamic psychology matters: it helps more people see the world as it truly is and become a walking Qur\\u2019an. As another author you asked us to reflect on puts it, more coherently: \\u201cOur purpose in writing this book is to equip ourselves with manners that lead to the most beautiful actions\\u2026 And the path to this is to first know our self\\u2026.\\u201d\\n\\n2) Restructured (same voice, clearer arc):\\nChapter 6 \\u2014 Maaristan. Maristans modeled care rooted in akhl\\u0101q\\u2014virtue as both hiring criterion and daily practice (Altintas, 2022; \\u00dcnver, 1939)\\u2014and that moral center seems to explain much of their humane and administrative success (Dols, 1992; Mitha, 2020). Modern research echoes this: outcomes often track the quality of the therapeutic relationship and the clinician\\u2019s personal qualities (Baier et al., 2020; Norcross & Lambert, 2019; Weck et al., 2015; Heinonen et al., 2012; Heinonen & Nissen-Lie, 2020). So the saying \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t matter what you do; it matters how you do it\\u201d keeps ringing in my ears. I\\u2019m not sold on claims like homeopathy, but I\\u2019m open to the idea that presence can transform. The Prophet (S) praised companions who used ruqyah with al-F\\u0101tiha; ultimately al-Sh\\u0101f\\u012b heals, and we open channels of asb\\u0101b within the sunnatull\\u0101h\\u2014the merciful patterns God (swt) allows. Aging itself can be mercy: weakness and need grow humility, compassion, patience, and return us to God. That\\u2019s why practitioner akhl\\u0101q matters\\u2014wudu\\u2019, du\\u02bf\\u0101\\u2019, and sincere care create non-intrusive windows for asb\\u0101b without breaking the sunan of Allah; sometimes results look empirical, yet remain deeply contextual and contingent on seen and unseen factors (like the doctor of ruqyah whose student \\u201cdid the same\\u201d but wasn\\u2019t the same). Culturally, an obsession with \\u201cDon\\u2019t Die\\u201d/life-extension can shade into a refusal to meet our Maker or make way for others\\u2014\\u201cl\\u0101 gh\\u0101liba ill\\u0101 All\\u0101h.\\u201d We can feel the social drag (boomers vs. younger cohorts, pensions, leadership) and even the chill on birthrates. Meanwhile, two \\u201cmedicines\\u201d consistently help: sleep and strong social ties. So a marist\\u0101n today should be open to new tools while rooted in wisdom. Yes, \\u201cevidence-based\\u201d matters, but the replication crisis urges humility; like diets, responses differ by genetics, microbiome, mood, movement, sunlight, timing, and more\\u2014maybe psychology needs a qualitative core and a broader lens that includes physical and metaphysical \\u201cmicrobiomes.\\u201d Ibn Rushd helps here: philosophy as contemplation of existence meets \\u02bfilm al-nafs and the Qur\\u2019anic call to iqra\\u2014to read signs within the self, the world, and Revelation\\u2014always through the boundary of Mercy and guided by furq\\u0101n. The more we purify (tazkiyat al-nafs), the clearer we see; that\\u2019s one reason Islamic psychology matters: helping us see reality as it is and, God-willing, become walking Qur\\u2019ans.

Modern research echoes this: outcomes often track the quality of the therapeutic relationship and the clinician's personal qualities (Baier et al., 2020; Norcross & Lambert, 2019; Weck et al., 2015; Heinonen et al., 2012; Heinonen & Nissen-Lie, 2020). \\n\\nSo the saying \\\"It doesn't matter what you do; it matters how you do it\\\" keeps ringing in my ears.
