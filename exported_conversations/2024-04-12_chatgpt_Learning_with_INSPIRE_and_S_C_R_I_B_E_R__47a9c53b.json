If you want to use LLMs effectively, you must comprehend the concept of traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nOver hundreds of hours of GPT use since last December, we’ve built this intuition. Now we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting. \n\nWe call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse) and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions.\n\nLet’s ease in with a simplified explanation as if you were five years old. \n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R Like You’re Five\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think Yourself\nSet Sail on an Adventure with Your Navigator's Talking Map!\nWelcome to a world of discovery and imagination! On this journey, you're not just wandering; you're an intrepid navigator with an extraordinary companion – a talking map. This map is no ordinary paper; it's alive with knowledge and adventure!\nYour Interactive Guide: The talking map knows about every nook and cranny of the world. It doesn't just show you places; it talks about them, suggests where to explore, and helps you think of questions about unknown corners of the world.\nJourney Across the Map: As you travel with your map, it might say, \"Have you ever wondered what lies beyond that mountain range?\" even when you don’t know there is a mountain range, because it has a maps eye view :D or \"Let's explore what's inside the belly of a fish at the bottom of the ocean!\" It's always ready to take you to new places and open up worlds you have yet to think to discover.\nThe Power of Curiosity: Your map's magic lies in its ability to spark your curiosity. Every new place it points out and every question it suggests is like unlocking a hidden treasure of knowledge. It encourages you to think, explore, and learn about things far beyond the ordinary.\nNavigating the Unknown: Remember, with your talking map, you're the navigator of your adventure. It's there to guide you, show you hidden paths, and inspire you to ask questions and find answers.\nReady to Discover Hidden Treasures? So, grab your navigator's talking map, and let's embark on a journey of discovery and learning. Who knows what wonders we'll uncover together!\nEmbark on an Epic Quest with Your Map of Everything!\nWelcome to a world brimming with endless possibilities! Imagine you're starting a grand adventure with two special maps in your hands. The first is your \"map of something\" – it's a map of what you already know, like your neighborhood, your favorite park, or the subjects you've learned in school. The second is a truly magical map, the \"map of everything,\" and it knows every secret and wonder in the world.\nYour Map and the Map of Everything: Your map might show where you live, where your school is, or where you've been on vacation. It's familiar and comfortable. But the \"map of everything\" is different. It's like a guide that knows all the places you've never seen or even imagined. When you tell this map about the places on your personal map, it starts to create paths to new, incredible destinations.\nJourney Beyond the Known: Think of your \"map of everything\" as a magical companion. Once you share with it where you are on your \"map of something,\" it begins to light up paths to extraordinary places. It could reveal a path from your backyard to a jungle full of talking animals, or from your classroom to a castle in the clouds!\nDiscovering New Worlds Together: Your \"map of everything\" doesn't just take you to new places; it also asks you questions and suggests adventures. It might ask, \"Do you want to see where the dinosaurs lived?\" or suggest, \"Let's find out what's at the edge of the universe!\" With every question and suggestion, it helps you explore worlds beyond your wildest dreams.\nYour Adventure Awaits: With these two maps, you're not just an explorer – you're a master navigator of knowledge and imagination. The \"map of everything\" guides you to the unknown, to help you discover and learn about amazing things you've never even thought about.\nAre You Ready to Explore the Unknown? Grab your \"map of something\" and join hands with your \"map of everything.\" Let's set off on a journey of endless discovery, where each step takes you to a new world of wonder and excitement!\n\n\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R For Adults\nPrompt Techniques to Help You Think for Yourself\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence is changing the world of work. Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet useless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to get better results.\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re somewhere in the graph, you can ask it what is around you that you “can’t see.” \nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think, not think for you. We developed these principles to help you experience this intuition about how LLMs operate and to teach you that you can now, perhaps for the first time in history, teach yourself the things you don’t even know you don’t know.\nMay you wield this tool well and create great benefits for yourself, your communities, and the world.\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\nSeek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\nCritique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\nReflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools to think with.\nInquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\nBroaden/Contract: Seek gaps. Ask the LLM for non-overlapping options and pick.\nExplain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\nRecurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you to ask it.\n\nThe following table shares the SCRIBE Framework in three parts.\nPrinciples are ideas that you keep it in mind and attempt to act upon them.\nTechniques are how you can apply the principles. It’s just one method of many.\nThe Way of Being is a quality of presence from which the principles and techniques can emerge. It can be cultivated by repeated practice of the techniques and deep reflection on the principles. It is what matters in the end.\n\nNote: Do NOT memorize this list. \nThese techniques and principles are tools to help us embody the knowledge. Aim to have a mindset of using LLMs as a tool for thought. \nExperts don't recite steps; they embody their knowledge. Imagine a chef constantly looking up recipes! It's not about following a checklist; it's about making the knowledge a part of who you are. It’s from here that new principles and techniques will emerge. \nThe ultimate goal of learning is to become.\n\nS.C.R.I.B.E.R\n 📙\nWay of Being ❤️\nTechnique\n 🤲\nPrinciple \n🧠\nSeek\nInquisitive and Open-minded\nAsking questions like: \n“Who would know how to answer this question, what is their job?” and\n\n“What guidelines would they follow?”\n\n“What would Steve Jobs say in response to this question?” \n\n\n(The more information and the more specific you make it, the better.\nExploration: \nGet the AI to show you what you don’t know by giving it as much as you know and then asking what you’re missing. Use AI to explore various 'neighborhoods' of knowledge\nCritique and explain\nReceptive to Feedback\nRegularly ask the LLM for critiques from a persona who will disagree. \n\nFor instance, if you’re a grant writer, ask for a review from a grant reviewer.\nConstructive Critique:\nActively seeking and integrating feedback to refine ideas and approaches.\nReflect\nThoughtfully Critical\nGenerate “worksheets” to fill for yourself. You can ask for templates, frameworks, worksheets, and guidelines AFTER identifying the domain expert. Once you pick your template, ask it to ask you questions to fill in a template for your topic. THEN review it and reflect on it on your own with a pencil/paper. \nIndependent Reflection:\nLeave the computer to think with paper. Let the LLM get you close and then walk the rest of the way to develop critical thinking and depth in understanding through reflective practices.\nInquire\nCurious and rigorous\nAsk the LLM to reveal its reasoning process. Ask it to summarize the critique and explain why the grant reviewer thinks that way. To move step by step and keep prompts small.\nAI Transparency: \nAsk the LLM to explain itself so YOU can catch the mistakes. This is also why you should break down each major step into its own prompt.\nBroaden / Contract\nOpen to change\nAsk the AI specifically for X number of diverse and non-overlapping options to your question. Ask it to critique them and ask you questions to help select.\nAI To Diversify and Simplify:\nAsking the LLM to expand options into the neighborhood’s unknown space can help you pick the non-obvious best option.\n Explain\nInquisitive Challenger\nAI is the devil's advocate and asks probing questions. Another technique is to ask for a panel of diverse experts and ask the AI to grill you.\nAI as a Questioning Tool:\nAsk it to help you find out where you can be wrong. Ask it to poke holes.\nGo step by step.\nRecurse\nNo self\nAsk it to ask you to ask it… \nSimple example, you’re a McKinsey consultant this is our first session, and my business is running out of runway and I need help. Ask me 5 questions to determine the kind of help I need for my business. \nLook at yourself from the third person: \nHow can you ask questions to the AI so it asks you questions so you can move to places you didn’t know to ask questions about.\n\n\nINSPIRE Aligned with SCRIBER and Assessments:\n\nINSPIRE Framework \nDescription\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nSCRIBER Framework \nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data analysis.\nSeek: Encouraging exploratory and deep questions.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nReflect: Promoting reflection through guided questioning and critical thinking.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nInquire: Learners guide their learning path with AI assistance.\nProblem Based Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nCritique: Seeking feedback and perspectives to tackle problems.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, communication in group settings.\nBroaden/Contract: Seeking diverse perspectives and refining ideas collaboratively.\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\nRecurse: Building resilience through iterative questioning and problem-solving.\nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nExplain: Deepening experiential learning through AI challenges.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\nAll SCRIBER Elements: Enhancing self-efficacy through various learning aspects.\n\n\n\n\n\nINSPIRE Pedagalogical View\nFramework Element\nDescription\nImpact Measurement\nPotential Assessment\nTheorist\nObservable Evidence\nInquiry-Based Learning\nLearners actively ask questions, investigate, and research.\nDepth and complexity of inquiry by learners.\nInquiry Skills Rating Scale.\nJohn Dewey\nQuality and scope of formulated questions, experiment design, data analysis.\nNarrative & Reflective Learning\nEmphasizes storytelling and personal reflection.\nConnection between personal experiences and learning objectives.\nReflective Writing Scale.\nDonald Schön\nDepth, personalization, and integration in reflective writing entries.\nSelf-Directed Learning\nLearners set and pursue their own learning goals.\nProgress towards self-set learning goals.\nSelf-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS).\nMalcolm Knowles\nLearners' readiness and capacity for self-directed learning.\nProblem-Based Learning\nLearning through addressing real-world problems.\nProblem-solving skills and application of knowledge.\nProblem-Based Learning Assessment Rubric.\nHoward Barrows\nProcesses and critical analysis in problem-solving.\nInteractive & Collaborative Learning\nLearning through interaction and collaboration.\nCollaborative skills and interaction quality.\nCollaborative Learning Assessment Tool.\nLev Vygotsky\nTeam dynamics, contributions, communication in group settings.\nResilience & Grit\nDeveloping persistence and resilience.\nPerseverance in learning challenges.\nGrit Scale.\nAngela Duckworth\nPersistence in tasks, passion for long-term goals.\nExperiential Learning\nHands-on activities and experiential learning.\nApplication of theoretical knowledge in practice.\nExperiential Learning Cycle Assessment.\nDavid Kolb\nStages of experiential learning: experience, observation, conceptualization, experimentation.\nSelf-Efficacy / Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy\nConfidence in entrepreneurial capabilities.\nConfidence in managing entrepreneurial challenges.\nEntrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale.\nAlbert Bandura, Martin, McNally, Kay\nSuccess in entrepreneurial tasks and milestones.\n\n\n",
