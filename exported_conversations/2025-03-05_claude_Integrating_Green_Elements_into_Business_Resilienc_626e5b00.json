How are you doing today? \nToday, we will talk all about your business plan. Up to this point, you thought everything through and you are starting to actually start your businesses! The business plan is a chance for you to put all of the most important information in one place.  \n1\n\nUnderstand what should be included in a business plan.\nReview examples of great business plans.\nBegin to create your business plan.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nUnderstand what should be included in a business plan.\nReview examples of great business plans.\nBegin to create your business plan.\n2\n\nBUSINESS PLAN\n20-30 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: What do you guys know about business plans? Why is it useful to have one?\n Show stakeholders that you have a clear strategy and plan for long-term success.\n Demonstrate that your business idea is viable and has a strong market foundation.\n Detail an effective implementation strategy, ensuring sustainability in business operations (in terms of longevity and adaptability, not just environmental aspects).\n Help you think through the different parts of your business\n Provide more detail to your pitch\n Highlights several points in detail:\nBusiness overview\nMarket research\nOperational plan\nTeam\nFinancials\n\n[[Original Ask: What do you guys know about business plans?

What are the things that you should show to prove that you have the best idea out there?\nHave the entrepreneurs explain what they think is most important.\nTry to write out the flow of an entire business plan based on what they say.\nAfter, go through the next slides to touch on the points they missed or go deeper on the important elements. \n\nRecap: A business plan is just like your pitch in the sense that it tells a story about why your business is a good bet. After pitching or getting some interest from an investor/granting organization, they might ask you for more information. Depending on the person, they might ask for a meeting or for a copy of your business plan. This business plan is your chance to show your professionalism and to dive into the details of your action plan. Many people think of a business plan as a long boring document that nobody looks at (which some people still do), but the business plan has evolved over time. It is detailed, but avoids unnecessary content. The main thing to show is where your business has been, where it is going, and how you plan on getting there.\nClassical: \nLong 50 page documents that nobody reads. \nTo many unnecessary details. \nQuantity over quality. \nBlack and white, text heavy, boring.\nModern: \nThere has been a shift to either pitch decks or short comprehensive plans. \nThese business plans are action oriented and interesting for the reader. \nQuality over quantity.\nRepresents your brand, highly visual, interesting.\n\n2 minutes: Transition\nAll of those points are correct, what we will do now is cover some of the key elements that should be included in a business plan. None of this is new, throughout the incubator you have already done this! Now it is about putting it together on one clean document! We will go over the points briefly, then we will spend the rest of the session working on them. You can follow along on your business plan template we sent you.\n\n3\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nWhere you are now\nHow you plan on getting there\nWhere you want to be\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe executive summary is the first thing in a business plan, but the very last thing you write. After you write out the whole business plan, you pull out the most important information and create a one page teaser document. This will highlight all of the important points you want to make in a brief overview.  It explains:\nWhere you are now: Why do you do what you do? Why are you here? What is the problem you have identified and what is the solution (your product/service)?\nWhere you want to be: What is the end result you are looking to achieve? What is the long-term impact and growth potential of your business?\nHow you plan on getting there: How are you planning to accomplish this? How do you know this will work?\n\nIf it wasn’t covered in the earlier brainstorm, ask: Why is this section really important to have?\nYou can send this out to people who might be interested in your business. If they are interested, they might ask for more information\nYou should be able to sum up the key elements of your business plan in one page! Where are you now, where do you want to go, and how will you get there?\nIt will highlight the most important things. People don’t have to read the whole thing if they don’t want to. \n\n\n\n4\n\nBUSINESS DESCRIPTION\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe next section is your business description. This is a really high level explanation of what you do. Be clear and simple. Don’t try to be fancy and use complicated explanations or jargon. You want people to really understand who you are and why you are here. \nAsk: When describing your business, which points should you include?\nDescription: Tell us about your business. Who are you, why are you here, and what do you do (think challenge-solution)? \nMake sure the way you talk about your business is consistent on your pitch, business plan, website, and social media. \nIf you talk about your business one way in the executive summary, talk about it the same way in your business description!\nMission Statement, Vision, values, and Goals: What do you want to accomplish through the existence of your business (usually not financial accomplishments)?\nRemember, write what works. If you think it is repetitive and not effective to write all of these, then don’t! You choose what will tell the best story for your business (where you have been, where you are going, how you will get there)\nProducts and services:  What are you offering, and what is its unique value? Be clear and obvious here.  \nAsk: When describing your products, what should you include? \nPotential answers:\nThe name of your products/services (write all revenue streams)\nPricing mechanism\nCompetitive advantage of each product/service\nAny patents? Copyrights?\nPhotos/screenshots (professional-looking ones!)\n\n5\n\nMANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION\n 3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe next section is your business management and organization. How will your business operate? What are key operational or organizational elements of your business that will be key to its success? \nAsk: When thinking about your management and organization, which points should you include?\nAllow entrepreneurs to share their thoughts.\nMake sure to touch on a few main points:\nYour team/organizational structure:\nWho is there now? What experience does your team bring to ensure the success of this business?\nWho do you plan to have on your team? Consider adding a hiring timeline of key and operational teammates.\nWhat kind of management and structure do you have? Consider including an “organigram” to show how the structure, reporting, and information flows to the different members of your team. \nDo you have a board of advisors?\nA solo founder isn’t convincing to investors. They want to see a strong passionate team and a supportive network to reassure them. \nYour legal structure:\nLegal requirements. Should you be registered to operate? How will you register?\nWhat is your legal structure? Are you a non profit? Are you a corporation, are you the only owner (sole proprietorship)?\nAre there any particular safety or health requirements you should follow?\nThis section is not necessary for everyone\nKey partners:\nDo you have any key partners, distributors, manufacturers, etc… that you are working with? \nExplain how your business will operate in coordination with other key players\nThis is not necessary for everyone\n6\n\nWho are your customers?\nHow big is the market?\nIs it growing?\nWho else is in the market? \nMARKET ANALYSIS\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe next section is your market analysis. Show evidence based on research. You can take the information from your feasibility study and add it in here. Who are your customers and competitors? How big is the market? \nAsk: If you wanted to prove with evidence that your business was a good bet in this market, what would you want to show?\nPotential answers:\n Good feedback from user research and testing\n Market size and future growth potential\n Trends that indicate shifting consumer preferences, operational efficiencies, or regulatory changes that may impact your business\n PESTEL analysis\n Competitive benchmarking or analysis (how your business fills those gaps)\n Supporting data (any research or figures that shows the market need or demand for a product like yours)\n Risk analysis\n Etc..\n[[Original - Potential answers:\nGood feedback from user research and testing\nMarket size\nMajor trends/risks that your business could take advantage of \nPESTEL analysis\nCompetitive benchmarking or analysis (how your business fills those gaps)\nSupporting data (any research or figures that shows the market need or demand for a product like yours)\nEtc…]]]\n\n7\n\nACTION PLAN\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nNext, we have the action plan. What will you do to make this business a success? How can you convince the people around you that this is a sustainable idea and you have thought everything through? Your action plan should clearly explain the steps you will take to turn the idea into a reality (or take your existing business and take it to the next level). Make sure that this is really practical, realistic, and reflects your financial projections. \nAsk: What could be included in your action plan? \nPotential answers:\nGo to market strategy\nGrowth and milestones\nSales and marketing strategy\nLocations\nStrategy\nTimeline\nPotential partners, distributors, and manufacturers\nHow do your startup costs/investment play into this action plan?\n8\n\n\nWhat’s do you need to turn this into reality?\nHow much do you think you will make in 1 year?\nHow much in 3 years?\nFINANCIAL PROJECTIONS\n$\n3-5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nNext, we have the financial projections.\nAsk: What should you show in terms of your financials? What story are you telling here?\nFinancial history: Show evidence that this idea will work through actual sales!\nWhat sales have you already made?\nCan you show any traction?\nKey financial or profitability ratios such as CAC, gross margin, and others we have talked about in the past (these can be very meaningful on actual financials)\n\nFinancial projections: Show where you expect to be going over the next few years!\nForecasting for 3-5 years\nThey should be strong numbers, but also realistic and based on facts or your market research.\nDoes this have potential to make money? \nWhen will you break even? \nBalance sheet/income statement/cash flow statements are all things that could be included. Remember to put a summary here or 3 year highlights. You can add detailed financials to the appendix if you want.\nKey financial or profitability ratios (these won’t be as meaningful if you don’t have a financial history because it is mostly made up)\n9\n\nAPPENDICES\n1 hour and 25 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\nFinally we have the appendices. You can add anything in here really, just remember to only add things that add value to the story you are telling. Don’t add things for no reason. What do you want to show that will prove that your ideas are great?\nAsk: What else might you want to include as an attachment to your business plan? \nPotential answers:\nSummary of research\nComplicated charts that you don’t want in the body of your document\nScreenshots of detailed financials\nCompetitive benchmarking\nSWOT analysis\nPictures of your product\nPictures of people using your product\nEtc…\n\n1 hour: Activity\nLet the entrepreneurs work on their business plans for the next hour. \nThey can use the template we provided, Canva, or anything else. \nRemind them that they can be creative with this and add or remove any sections they would like based on what they think would be valuable information.\n\n20 minutes: Share\nBring them back for the last 20 minutes or so to go around the room and share. \nWhat was each entrepreneur able to accomplish during this time? \nDid anyone have any trouble? Did anyone have any great successes that they would like to share?\n\n10\n\nDESIGN AND LAYOUT\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThe last point we will talk about is the Design and layout of your business plan. Just like a pitch deck, your business plan should be well thought through and designed carefully. You should match themes with your pitch deck, website, application, Facebook page, social media, and more. Remember, you are creating a brand!\nPoint out that they should feel free to adjust the template we sent out in any they want. We sent a simple word document plan, which is acceptable. \nSubstance is more important than design! The design should be there to make it more readable and understandable first. \nShow them alternative layouts (click through the slides):\nTell them to go onto Canva to find some simple, yet creative business plan templates. Simply search “business plan” into the search bar and several options will come up.\nPoint out that these are just examples and they should find a theme that represents their brand. It should have their logos, photos of their products, and their color and font schemes. \n\n\nAsk: Based on what you know about branding, how should you design your business plan?\nUse the same fonts and color scheme.\nMake it visually appealing, clear, and easy to read\nIt should have your own touch to it and be linked to who you are and what you are doing. Link your UVP into this as well. \nAre you innovative? Be innovative here as well. \nAre you creative? Be creative here. \nAre you highly professional? Your document should be highly professional.\nEtc…\n\n11\n\n\n Create a first draft of your business plan.\n\n Please keep in mind:\nCheck your spelling and grammar!\nDetails are everything.\nSource your information & explain assumptions.\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n13\n"

The GYB manual\nwill help you to determine whether you have\nthe right characteristics to become an en-\ntrepreneur, to generate business ideas using\ndifferent sources, and to assess and pick the\nbest idea.\nThis chapter of the GBB helps you to do the\nabove from a green perspective. While this\nchapter is primarily intended for aspiring en-\ntrepreneurs in search of a business idea, it\nmay also prove useful for entrepreneurs who\nalready have a business but would like to di-\nversify their product or service range.\n2.1\nDo I have the right\ncharacteristics to become a\ngreen entrepreneur?\nGreen entrepreneurs are involved in the pro-\nduction of environmentally friendly products\nand services or make use of processes that\nare environmentally friendly.\nGreen entrepreneurs like any other entrepre-\nneurs need to possess certain characteris-\ntics to be successful. These characteristics\n(passion; goal-orientation; decision-making;\nrisk-taking; ability to handle stress; ability\nto access to social support; financial endow-\nment; business management skills) are dis-\ncussed in detail in the GYB manual.\nIn addition to these general characteristics,\ngreen entrepreneurs need to think about the\nplanet and its people along with profit, so\nsome further characteristics are required.\nWhen completing the assessment in the\nGYB manual, we recommend you also re-\nflect on whether you have these additional\ncharacteristics.\nA GREEN ENTREPRENEUR NEEDS TO BE:\n•\n•\n•\nAnalytical – As the green sector is rela-\ntively new, entrepreneurs venturing into it\nneed to be able to analyze the potential for\nsuccess and failure and plan accordingly.\nInnovative – Green entrepreneurs need\nto be able to “think outside the box” and\ncome up with new solutions to address en-\nvironmental problems.\nCommitted to ethical standards – A green\nentrepreneur needs to think about profit,\nbut also about people and the planet (the\n3 “P”s) when making business decisions.\nWhen developing green business ideas, consider your future market and\nresources that can be availed. This Zambian architect decided to take an\neco-friendly approach while building affordable houses.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 11\n2.2\nComing up with your\ngreen business idea\nYour green idea is the starting point for your\ngreen business.\nThe GYB manual provides guidance on many\ndifferent ways of coming up with business ide-\nas. These include learning from business peo-\nple, drawing from your own and other people’s\nexperiences, surveying your local business area,\nscanning your environment and structured and\nunstructured brainstorming.\nA green business idea can relate to either a\ngreen product or a green service, or it can re-\nlate to a “standard” product or service, but\nwhich is produced or delivered in a green way.\nSome examples of green ideas are provided in\nthe box below.\nSOME GREEN BUSINESS IDEAS:\n•\nOrganic fertilizer\n•\nOrganic beauty products\n•\nBiodegradable packaging\n•\nOrganic restaurant\n•\nSouvenirs made from waste\n•\nEco-tourism\n•\nGreen building materials\n•\nEco-friendly transport service\nIn order to come up with a green business\nidea, you may use the brainstorming exercise\nbelow to complement the exercises in the GYB\nmanual, thinking about what environmental\nproblems need to be solved in your community\nand about what resources in your community\ncould be tapped into:\nENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE COMMUNITY\n1a. What health\nand environmental\nproblems exist in\nyour community?\n1b. What is al-\nready being done\nto address these\nproblems?\n1c. What is not\nyet being done at\nall, or what is not\nbeing done well?\nNATURAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY\n2a. Does your\ncommunity have\nany natural re-\nsources or waste\nproducts that\ncould be used for\nbusiness?\n2b.

Are there any\nuntapped opportu-\nnities to make use\nof these resources?\nYOUR BUSINESS IDEAS\nBased on your answers to question 1c and 2c, list as many\ngreen business ideas as possible:\nIdea 1: Idea 2: Idea 3: Idea 4:\nIdea 5:\nIdea 6:\n12 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n2.3 Screening and\nselecting your green\nbusiness idea\nOnce you have come up with your list of possi-\nble business ideas, you need to decide which\none is the most suitable for you.\nTo do this, you need to describe each idea in\ndetail and then screen them.\nThe GYB manual advises you to use the following\nfive questions to describe each of your ideas:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nWhich need is fulfilled?\nWhat product or service will the business\nsell?\nWho will the business sell to?\nHow will the business sell its product or\nservice?\nHow much will the business depend on and\nimpact the environment?\nWhen completing the description and address-\ning the question on the environmental depend-\nence and impact, consider the following issues:\n•\nTo what extent does the business depend on the surrounding natural environment (soil, wood,\ncharcoal, fish, wind, sun, water, etc.)?\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n•\nWill the business have a positive impact on the environment (clean the water, improve the\nsoil, etc.)?\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n•\nWill the business affect the environment in any negative way?\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\n...........................................................................................................................................................................\nTYPE OF IMPACT Y N N/A\nDETAILS ON THE NEGATIVE\nIMPACTS & WAYS IN WHICH THEY\nCAN BE AVOIDED OR MINIMIZED:\nWill it use large amounts of fossil\nfuel-based energy?\nWill it use large amounts of water?\nWill it use natural resources that are\nin short supply or overexploited?\nWill it require the use of harmful\nchemicals?\nWill it generate large amounts of\nsolid waste?\nWill it create air pollution?\nWill it create soil pollution?\nWill it create water pollution?\nThe GYB manual then advises you to carry\nout a “Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities\nand Threats” (SWOT) analysis to assess a few\nof your ideas and identify the best idea from\namong your list.\nWhen doing the SWOT exercise, you should\nalso keep in mind strengths, weaknesses, op-\nportunities and threats that relate specifically\nto the green dimension of your product.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 13\nGreen SWOT analysis example:\nSTRENGTHS WEAKNESSES\nConventional\nstrengths\nHigh-revenue product\nGreen\nstrengths\nEnergy & material\nefficient production pro-\ncess can decrease costs\nand increase profits\nConventional\nweaknesses\nLack of skilled labour\nGreen\nweaknesses\nLack of knowhow to\nproduce innovative prod-\nucts (e.g. solar panels)\nneeded for the idea\nOPPORTUNITIES THREATS\nConventional\nopportunities\nUpcoming market for\nthis product\nGreen\nopportunities\nLarge consumer base for\neco-friendly & healthy\nproducts\nConventional\nthreats\nCheaper product availa-\nble in the market\nGreen\nthreats\nGovernment subsidies\nfor competing, non-\ngreen products\nImportant: Remember that even if your\nmain motivation is to help overcome an en-\nvironmental problem, you cannot only think\nabout the environmental dimensions when\nassessing your idea. It is equally important\nto assess the economic dimensions such as\nwhether there will be sufficient demand for\nthe product or service. If your business idea\nis not economically viable, it cannot succeed,\nno matter how noble the idea may be. So you\nneed a sound business idea to be able to help\nthe environment!\n14 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n3\nYOUR GREEN\nBUSINESS PLAN\nAs you now know, a green business may be a\nbusiness that sells green products or services,\nor which operates according to green princi-\nples. Green businesses therefore contribute\nto solving environmental problems and have a\nminimal negative impact on the environment.\nIn order to launch your business, you need to\ndevelop a business plan. The Start Your Busi-\nness (SYB) package has a detailed step-by-\nstep process for developing a business plan.\nThe business plan for your green business\nneeds to be adapted to include key elements\nthat are critical in starting a green business. In\naddition to coming up with a viable green busi-\nness idea (see Chapter 2 for guidance), as you\nThe founder of Lemonbar decided to start a business that serves organic\ndrinks to a health-oriented clientele. To get started with your green business,\na first step is the development of a business plan.\nplan for starting your green business it is im-\nportant to also look at the business processes\nand workplace behaviours and practices with\nthe objective of increasing resource efficiency,\nclean production and reducing any possible\nnegative impacts on the environment.\nThis section of the GBB highlights some im-\nportant green aspects to include in the busi-\nness plan.\nA more in-depth overview of how to green your\nprocesses by setting up an environmental\nmanagement system (EMS), also important for\nyour business plan, is provided in the following\nchapter, as it is applicable not only to starting\nenterprises, but also existing ones.\n3.1 The green dimensions of\nyour business plan\nWriting a green business plan is one of the\nmost important steps for starting up a green\nbusiness. The development of the plan is not\nan overnight process and may take several\nweeks to complete. The business plan for your\ngreen business should cover all the aspects to\nbe considered before starting the business.\nThe main components of a business plan are\noutlined in this chapter. For all the compo-\nnents of your business plan, you need to make\nsure that you add any green dimensions that\nare relevant.\nThese green dimensions may relate to:\n•\nHow the environment is affected by the par-\nticular business plan component: for exam-\nple, in terms of marketing, when consider-\ning distribution, long-distance transport will\nbe more damaging to the environment than\nshort distances.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 15\n•\nHow each of the business plan components\nis affected by the green characteristic of your\nproduct/service: for example, when consider-\ning the price, you may be able to charge more\nthan your competitors because customers may\nbe willing to pay more for a green product, and\nyou may thereby enjoy a higher profit margin.\nYou will note that the business plan also in-\ncludes a section on greening your business.\nGreening is a cross-cutting issue that will come\nup in most other sections of your business plan.\nHowever, it is useful to give greening specific\nattention through a section specifically devoted\nto summarising all the required measures.\nBUSINESS PLAN\nCOMPONENT\nPURPOSE &\nGREEN DIMENSION\nExecutive summary The executive summary is an outline of your green business idea. In addition to\nthe generic issues covered in a business plan, the summary should highlight its\ngreen dimensions.\nYour business idea All business plans are based on an idea. In describing your idea, you need to high-\nlight what makes it unique as a green business (in terms of the product/service or\nprocess).\nThe marketing plan Your marketing plan needs to be based on a solid understanding of the market.\nOnce you know your market, you then need to develop a marketing plan based\non the 7 “P”s: Product, Price, Place, Promotion, People, Process, and Physical\nEvidence. Consider the environmental dimension of these 7 “P”s when developing\nthe plan (for example, for “Price”, whether you can charge a premium price).\nStaff You will need to decide what your business’ staffing needs are based on what tasks\nneed to be performed. When assessing what staff you need, consider whether any\nadditional technical skills are needed for your green product/service.\nOrganization and\nmanagement\nLike any entrepreneur, you will need to decide on the form of business. A green\nbusiness can take one of many forms, including a sole proprietorship, a partner-\nship, or a cooperative, for example. You should weigh the pros and cons of each\nbefore choosing the best form.\nYou will also need to consider all required taxes and permits and select an appro-\npriate insurance policy; make sure to include environmental taxes and environ-\nmental permits when doing so.\nBuying for your\nbusiness\nYour business will need to buy before you make or sell your products/services.\nWhen buying for your business, consider how environmentally friendly the materi-\nals or equipment you buy are.\nGreening your\nprocesses\nGreening your processes covers a range of elements, starting from how environ-\nmentally friendly your raw materials are to how you get your product to your final\nconsumers. To ensure the environmental-friendliness of your enterprise, you should\nset up an environmental management system (EMS). This system will help you\ntrack and improve your performance in key areas such as procurement, energy and\nwater consumption, pollution prevention, distribution and waste management.\nCosting To be able to set your price and make a financial plan, you will need to calculate\nthe cost of your products. Keep in mind that you may incur some additional costs\nat the outset for green investments relating to equipment, premises or skills, but\nalso that you will most likely make savings thanks to green practices such a re-\nduced consumption of electricity or water, resulting in reduced utility bills.\nFinancial planning You need to be able to plan and monitor the financial situation of your business\nusing tools such as the profit plan and a cash flow plan. Like any other business,\nyour green business needs to perform financially, otherwise you will not be able to\nkeep it going!\nRequired start-up\ncapital\nWhen estimating the required start-up capital, you will need to assess your needs\nin terms of capital investment and working capital. Consider the elements required\nfor your business to be green while estimating this cost, and be realistic when\ndoing so.\nSources of start-up\ncapital\nThe most important types of start-up capital are owner’s equity and loans. Keep in\nmind that there are also a number of institutions with special funding opportuni-\nties for green businesses."

How are you doing today? \nToday we will be talking about your supply chain. Many of your products/services have some physical element to it. We will break down how you get those things and how they impact your business and customers. If you don’t have a physical element to your business (many tech businesses), this information is still good to know. A lot of what we will talk about are just good business practices in general.  \n1\n\nExperience a rapid product development process.\nUnderstand the different parts of your supply chain.\nEvaluate how to add value along your supply chain.\n\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nExperience a rapid product development process.\nUnderstand the different parts of your supply chain.\nEvaluate how to add value along your supply chain.\n2\n\nDEVELOP A \u000bNEW PRODUCT\n1 hour: Activity (you can find an alternate online activity on the drive)\n5 Minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work in groups to go through a rapid product development process.\nTell everyone they are a business developing a new product that will be sold to the training team: a paper airplane. The plane has to fly and look good. The price will reflect its design, functionality, and how efficiently it is produced. Based on the trainers' thoughts on your plane, they will give your plane a selling price.\nBreak the group into small teams (about 3 people per team).\nThe trainer should have prototyping materials ready, including paper, markers, stickers, etc. These items are available to the entrepreneurs to continue using as they want throughout the entire game. They can use whatever they want.\nEntrepreneurs are free to continue asking the trainers (the people buying the planes) questions about the activity/type of plane to design (they can do user research to find out more about how to design their plane based on customers' needs/wants).\nEntrepreneurs should feel free to work with their groups wherever they are comfortable.\n55 Minutes: Activity\n10 minutes: The team will have 10 minutes to design a new product (paper airplane). Encourage them to consider how to make an effective design while using materials efficiently.\n10 minutes: Each group will pitch their plane to the trainer.\nThe trainer will evaluate functionality, design, and the overall pitch to determine a price for each plane.\nThe trainer can also consider the amount of work that went into the plane design. Did the team create a design that maximized performance while minimizing wasted materials?\nThe trainer should set prices like $2, $5, $10, $15, $20 depending on detail and flying capabilities. Try to have a variety of prices.\nTell them that each plane costs $5 to make (make it all the same to keep it simple). When we price the plane, some people will get better margins or worse margins.\nAnd some people would be able to produce a lot or a little, causing different levels of profitability. Some designs might be more efficient, allowing for faster production or lower costs. It depends on how the game goes, but interesting conversations come up.\n15 Minutes: Scaling Up the Production\nAnnounce to the groups that you like all of the planes they pitched and you would like to purchase them for your store.\nThey will have 10 minutes to produce 15 of the planes they pitched.\nHalfway through this time (after about 7 minutes), announce a change in demand:\nYou are expecting high demand for these planes after a focus group, and you would like to order 25 planes instead.\nAnnounce that you will extend the delivery time by 5 additional minutes (13 minutes left for production).\n15 Minutes: Evaluation & Discussion\nBring everyone back and tell people production has stopped—they must now deliver their products.\nThe trainer will now pay each group for their product.\nCount each plane that matches the one they pitched. Reject planes that do not work or do not match what they pitched to you.\nMultiply the number of accepted planes by the price that was set before mass production.\nSubtract $5 for each plane they made (even if the plane was rejected because they produced it).\nCalculate who made the most money!\nTrainer Tip: Make it more fun by offering a small piece of candy for each $ of profit they made. (Some teams might realize that a more efficient process leads to higher profits!) Some people might owe you candy at the end if they weren’t profitable…. But don’t actually make them give you candy.\n\n[[Original Version]]\n5 minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work in groups to go through a rapid product development process.\nTell everyone they are a business developing a new product that will be sold to the training team: a paper airplane.

And write key learning outcomes on the whiteboard or Jamboard.\nPotential questions to ask: \nWhat did you learn from this activity?\nWhat was your team approach to this activity? \nHow did you decide what plane to do (listened to one paper plane expert on the team, tested many to find the best, copied someone else, simple and efficient basic plane, etc…)?\nWhat challenges came up? What did you learn from those challenges?\nWere there any successes? What worked so well?\nDid you prepare for production during your design phase?\nDid you think about who on your team will manufacture the plane? Did everyone on the team know how to make it?\nWhen manufacturing, were you able to keep the product consistent? \n\nPossible learning outcomes can include: \nCommunication is important (with your team and with your clients). \nSome teams forgot about the bigger picture (they are selling a product). Focus on the end game.\nMake sure you know what you are getting into before agreeing to anything\nConsider available resources and your actual capabilities while designing\nBe prepared to meet customers changing demands quickly and accurately\nConsider negotiating when necessary. Most people just agreed when they were asked to deliver more products. You could have agreed, or negotiated to only make the ones that you could. That is a business decision. Can you adapt quickly and meet the demand? Or should you stick with your original contract and do what you agreed to at high quality? Maybe you weren’t actually capable of doing it, that is ok. But keep in mind, in real life, demand can change in an instant and you would want to capitalize on that if possible.\n\nRecap: These are all really important things that we learned. However, the real question is how do we take these learnings and create systems so that we don’t make the same mistakes when we are actually running our business? \n\n5\n\nResearch, design, & development\nMarketing and sales\nProduction and delivery\nQuality control\nDEVELOPMENT PROCESS\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nDiscuss what you did as a group and how it is linked to any typical business and its activities. If these points were covered on the previous slide, just quickly recap them and move on.\nResearch, Design, and Development: All businesses have to do the right research before starting their business. Based on that research, they should design, test, and build out their full set of products/services.\nAsk:\n Did anyone ask me what kind of plane I was interested in? Or what I needed it for?\n Who will use it? Or what color and design I might like?\n Could you have made a design that was easier to build?\n If you did, you would have gotten a leg up in the exercise because you might have been able to plan better, know how many I wanted, or know which planes I was interested in “buying.” Early-stage research can prevent inefficiencies, help businesses design smarter, and more scalable products.\n Never forget about how important this step is. Make the time to do the right research to set yourself up for success down the line.\n\n Marketing and Sales: Each team had their product evaluated and accepted or rejected from the “market.” Your price was set by the quality of the plane and how it met my needs.\n Many of you were very clever during your pitch. Some of you targeted emotions, some of you targeted functionality, etc. It would have been really smart if you knew what I wanted the plane for by doing the right research ahead of time.\n Ask: How does knowing your customer’s needs help you sell more efficiently?\n \n Production and Delivery: All of you have great ideas, but if you can’t make and deliver your product/service to the market, then your business will fail!\n Some planes were priced really high because they were really amazing, but it was too much for them to deliver!\n Maybe you made a plane that only one person on the team knew how to make, and it was really time-consuming.\n Some of you ran out of raw materials.\n Ask: Did anyone experience this? What did you do to get around the challenge?\n\n Quality Control: Never forget about quality control! So many of you gave planes that I didn’t want. They were poor quality, and I refused to pay for them, which cost your business.\n You should put a system in place to make sure that the quality of your product is ensured at every step while also maintaining efficiency.\n Ask: Who had a system for quality control? What worked well, what didn’t?\n\n Recap: At each of these steps, there was an opportunity to make me a happy customer and provide me with value. You can either lower your costs or make your product more tailored to customer needs—but the best businesses do both.\n When developing your product, think about:\n How it will be produced efficiently.\n How it will be shipped at the lowest cost.\n How it will be stored without waste.\n How it will be packaged to balance protection and material use.\n\n The design of the product itself is one of the key steps that will determine your supply chain. Entrepreneurs should ask themselves how they will actually be able to manage the successful delivery of a product to their customers. To do that, you have to carefully break down each step. \n[[Original Version]]\nDiscuss what you did as a group and how it is linked to any typical business and its activities.

Some of you targeted emotions, some of you targeted functionality, etc… It would have been really smart if you knew what I wanted the plane for by doing the right research ahead of time to pitch directly to my needs. \nProduction and delivery: All of you have great ideas, but if you can’t make and deliver your product/service to the market, then your business will fail! Some planes were priced really high because they were really amazing, but it was too much for them to deliver! Maybe you made a plane, that only one person on the team knew how to make and it was really time consuming. Some of you ran out of raw materials. \nAsk: Did anyone experience this?

You can either lower your costs, or you could have made it more tailored to my needs. When developing your product, think about how this design will be produced, shipped, stored, packaged, and more. The design of the product itself is one of the key steps that will determine your supply chain. As you develop a product or service, entrepreneurs should ask themselves how they will actually be able to manage the successful delivery of a product to their customers. To do that, you have to carefully break down each step. \n\n6\n\nUNDERSTAND YOUR CAPABILITIES\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nBefore you get into any agreement, make sure that you fully understand your capabilities before you agree to anything. \nAsk: What are the things that you should be sure of (in terms of your capabilities) to make sure that you can deliver on the work you are agreeing to. \nPotential answers:\nYou can get the materials to make the product/service. \nThe materials are of the quality that you want and your customers demand\nYou have enough time to make and deliver your product/service. This includes you and your team. \nYou are choosing materials and suppliers that balance cost, reliability, and efficiency.\nYou have considered how the availability of materials and production methods could affect your delivery timeline.\nYou have the knowledge and skill set to deliver your product or service. Each member of your team has the knowledge and skills to work efficiently and collaboratively. \nYou have the money and resources to deliver your product or service.\nYou have the energy, patience, and excitement to deliver this product or service. \n7\n\nAdapt quickly:\nBUSINESS EFFICIENCY CHECKLIST\nFacilitator notes:\nUse the Business Efficiency Workbook to Optimize Your Supply Chain\nEncourage participants to use the checklist to evaluate their own supply chain processes and identify where they can optimize.\nSuggest that businesses periodically review their efficiency levels using this tool to adapt to market changes.\nAsk: What areas in your supply chain could be improved using this checklist?\n8\n\nAdapt quickly:\nIntegrated supply chain\nCommunication \nUnderstand customers\nADAPT QUICKLY\u000b\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAnother technique to help your supply chain is by enabling yourself to be able to adapt quickly. In the activity we did, we created 1 item, imagine doing this for hundreds or thousands of items. What if you were working in several cities and you had many employees to get onboard a new project? What would you do if you had to adapt quickly? What systems should you have in place to allow for quick and adaptive responses? Sometimes there are crises that happen (Coronavirus for example) that totally change things. How will your business adapt quickly and efficiently? \n\nAsk: What are ways that you can enable yourself to adapt quickly and respond to change?\nPotential answers: \nIntegrated supply chain: Create a supply chain that connects all the different partners in one place through a system that facilitates good communication and efficiency. Ask: What can you do to create an “integrated supply chain”?\nCoordinate the movement of your products and services. Track your shipments or other arrangements with suppliers online. Although you might not have a digital system, you can ask the person to give you weekly updates on the status of your deliveries.  \nMake sure that there is always a path for clear information flows with key partners (see communication point below)\nHave each of your partners in your supply chain communicating with each if relevant. \nReduce the number of steps in your supply chain, or find a supplier that can deal with multiple steps (or you can take control of more steps)\nUse technology to manage the supply chain more efficiently and know what is happening at each step. There is software for this, but probably not relevant for businesses at this stage\nEtc…\nCommunication - When you are developing/designing the product, make sure you communicate with all the stakeholders\nCommunication with partners:\nHave a system to quickly share information with key partners (tell a supplier about change in demand, for example)\nThis could be through the phone, email, or something else, but it can be slow and is susceptible to a lot of human error. \nYou can purchase online systems \nDesignate certain employees to be the communicators to certain partners\nEtc…\nCommunication with your team:\nDoes the team know why they are doing this? \nMake a clear connection between marketing, design, procurement, and other teams in your organization\nWhat is the system in place to communicate big news and information? – Which system is best to make sure key information is made clear to the team and things aren’t lost along the way?\nSlack\nEmail?\nFace to face?\nUnderstand customers: \nInternet (gather data on them)\nAsk them (surveys, feedback, SM, etc…)\nLearn from other parts of the supply chain (integrate processes so you can observe changes in demand)\nEtc...\n\nRecap: Be responsive to changing customer demands and changing markets. Do this by putting systems in place to be able to forecast potential trends and also communicate with key partners to adapt quickly. \n\n9\n\nINVENTORY MANAGEMENT\u000b\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nBefore you get into any agreement, make sure that you fully understand your capabilities before you agree to anything. \nAsk: What are the things that you should consider while managing inventory? What systems can you put in place to make sure that your inventory is being managed well?\nPotential answers:\nCategorize your assets in a logical way so that you always know what is there and you can easily organize information. This prevents unnecessary purchases and waste. \nDigitize your inventory. Consider buying a software to manage inventory. Or keep digital records by tracking your purchases and sales. Digital tracking helps prevent overstocking or running out of key materials.\nManage inventory based on safety levels. Make sure you set a range on how much inventory you need at one time. You don’t want too much because it can be expensive to store, materials can expire or degrade, and space can be wasted, etc… And you don’t want to run out of materials because then you miss out on sales opportunities or slow down production! Find a good level, and stick to it. Keep records so you can learn about seasonal trends over time (in case inventory changes seasonally, safety levels might change too)\nPerform routine checks. Check in on your inventory now and again to make sure that your digital records are accurate. Maybe things aren’t being managed correctly causing broken, stolen, or damaged products.\nEtc…\n10\n\nSales \nPromotion\nSUPPLY CHAIN MAPPING\n10 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nA Supply Chain is the entire system of producing and delivering a product or a service, from the very beginning stage of sourcing the raw materials to the final customer. \nLet’s do an example together. Let’s take a simple mug and break down its supply chain together and identify areas to make a more efficient supply chain.\nUse some of the questions below to prompt the group to map out the full supply chain for a mug (or another example):\nWhat are the raw materials needed for this product? Where are they found?\nWhat are the steps involved in making this product? Where does each step in the production take place?\nWhat energy is needed to produce this item? Where does that energy come from?\nWhat kind of transportation, if any, is needed at each stage of the production process, including getting the finished product to you?\nWhich steps does the business control vs other companies? Are there opportunities for the business to control more? Would it be a good idea to take control?\nPotential answer for the supply chain mapping of a mug:\nPurchase the best materials (procurement) – Maybe we buy the ceramic mugs from China and cardboard boxes for packaging from another retailer in China. These items get shipped through Alibaba.\nAsk: What should you consider during the procurement stage? \nTake into consideration customers preferences\nConsider your brand\nConsider your budget\nHow convenient is it to buy this material? \n\nManufacturing and operations– We are not manufacturing anything because we pre-order from China, but we need to package and label all the products to prepare for shipping to the customers. This will happen in the office you rented with your small team. \nAsk: What should you consider during the manufacturing and operations stage? \nManage time limits and employees\nComplete all tasks on time and with high quality\nClean up and prepare for continued work\n\nLogistics and transportation – We need to store and ship all the mugs to the customers address. We will store the items in our store. We use a 3rd party delivery company and also sell from our storefront. \nAsk: What should you consider during the logistics and transportation stage? \nHow will your packaging affect storage, transportation, and delivery? \nHow can you ensure timely delivery?\nWhere will you store your product? \nHow will you get the product to your customers? \n\nIkea example: Take the case of Ikea – its ‘Bang’ mug has been redesigned many times to realize shipping cost savings (pictures show first and final versions of the cups). Originally, 864 mugs would fit into a pallet; after redesign a pallet held 1,280 mugs. With a further redesign 2,024 mugs could be held. This act of packaging ingenuity and attention to detail reduced its shipping costs by 60%. In addition, IKEA now owns a huge number of forests so that it controls some areas of its own supply. They use wood from this forest in their own products instead of paying a little bit more for someone else to provide the wood. They are able to profit off of this because they are a huge company and benefit from economies of scale. \n11\n\nSales \nPromotion\nMAP YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN\n45 minutes: Activity\n\n35 minutes: Activity\nNow you will apply this to your business.\nEveryone should map out their supply chain and pinpoint areas that they can create value. \nResearch the raw materials needed to make your product and how these raw materials come together to form the finished product. \nMake sure entrepreneurs have the handout where they can answer the following questions:\nWhat are the raw materials needed for your product? Where are they found?\nWhat are the steps involved in making your product? Where does each step in the production take place?\nWhat energy is needed to produce this product/service? Where does that energy come from?\nWhat kind of transportation, if any, is needed at each stage of the production process, including getting the finished product to your customers? \nFinally, think about how you can add value to either your business or your customers. \nCan you reduce steps?\nCan you control more steps?\nCan you cut costs?\nCan you be more sustainable? \nEtc…\nIf you are having trouble, think about the \"happy path\" of your whole business. Go through each step and think about all the activities that you have to do to run and operate your business. Then, at each activity, think about how you will turn this idea to reality. \nEncourage everyone to think about how they could apply the activity to their business; however, if someone insists that they don’t have a supply chain in any form, have them help someone else work on theirs. \n\n10 minutes: Discussion\nYour supply chain has a big impact on your business, people, and the environment. Some supply chains are completely local, while others have supply chains that are around the world. Every decision you make on how to source, produce, transport, sell your product/materials has an impact. \nAsk: How can you make sure that your supply chain is sustainable, cost effective, and creating a positive impact?\nPotential answers:\nMake sure that each step of your supply chain is sourcing their supplies ethically (don’t use sweatshops, child labor, causing environmental harm, etc…)\nProduce as much as you can locally to reduce transportation costs, CO2 emissions, and provide jobs to the local economy\nCut costs by renegotiating partnerships or cutting out steps all together\nBe more efficient and reduce waste wherever you can\nOptimize inventory and transportation by using systems and data analytics\nImprove functionality by making things easier and saving time\nA more efficient and sustainable supply chain can be a great source of value creation\nYou can cut costs and increase your profitability\nYou can cut costs and pass savings over to your customers, increasing value for them\nYou can create value for customers and stakeholders by being more sustainable and eco friendly\n\nRecap: Inventory, distribution, production, procurement and transportation are some of the key costs that exist in the supply chain. Being able to find ways to minimize them is a recognized competitive advantage, and one way to create a lasting competitive edge.\n\n12\n\n\nRe-evaluate your supply chain and identify at least 3 ways you can create value in your supply chain (reduce costs, streamline processes, track and measure more efficiently)\n\n\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS:\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n14\n]]] and here are the slides attached "

Think about the fol-\nlowing questions: Do you need to hire extra staff?\nOr can you train existing staff? If this is needed,\nwhat types of training are available, which institu-\ntions offer such trainings, and at what cost? Or, al-\nternatively, could you rely on short-term expertise\nfrom outside of your business?\n3.1.4 Organization and management\nLike any entrepreneur, you will need to decide\non the form of business. A green business can\ntake any of the legal forms available in your\ncountry, such as a sole proprietorship, a part-\nnership, a cooperative or a limited company, for\nexample. You should familiarize yourself with\neach form and weigh the pros and cons before\nchoosing the most appropriate form.\nYou will also need to consider the taxes that\nyour business has to pay, licenses and permits\nit needs to obtain, and insurance that it needs\nto take out. Keep in mind that:\n•\nOn top of other generic taxes, in some coun-\ntries businesses may need to pay additional\ntaxes that are related to the environment,\nsuch as pollution tax; depending on the\n18 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\ngreen choices you make, you may be able\nto lower the tax amounts you pay or even be\ncompletely exempt.\n•\nEnvironmental permits may be included in\nthe regulations of your country, and in order\nto obtain a permit, you may need to submit\nan environmental impact assessment report\nor other documentation to show how you in-\ntend to assess and address environmental\nissues in your business.\n3.1.5 Buying for your business\nYour business will need to buy before you make\nor sell your products/services. When buying for\nyour business, consider:\n•\nHow environmentally friendly the equipment\nand materials you buy are. Are the products\ncertified through a recognized label?\n•\nIf sourcing natural resources such as wood,\ncharcoal, fish, water etc., whether these\nare sustainably produced or overexploited,\nwhich is a risk not only for the environment\nbut also for your business future.\n•\nWhether the materials and equipment are\navailable locally or as close as possible to\nyour business to avoid long-distance trans-\nport. This will also help the business to re-\nduce the cost of transport. Reduced travel\ntime will mean quicker access to the mate-\nrials needed for production or the provision\nof services.\n3.1.6 Greening your processes\nGreening your processes covers a range of el-\nements, starting from how environmentally\nfriendly your raw materials are to how you get\nyour product to your clients.\nTo ensure the environmental-friendliness of\nyour enterprise, you should set up an envi-\nronmental management system (EMS). This\nsystem will help you track and improve your\nperformance in key areas such as:\n•\nProcurement: using environmentally friendly\nand locally available materials.\n•\nEnergy and water consumption: using energy\nand water from renewable sources and sav-\ning energy and water where possible.\n•\nPollution prevention in production/service\nprovision: using low-emission equipment\nand techniques.\n•\nDistribution: using environmentally friendly\ntransport methods and avoiding long distances.\n•\nWaste management: reducing, reusing and\nrecycling where possible and disposing what\nneeds to be disposed of in a responsible way.\nThe setting up of this system is discussed in\nmore detail in the next chapter; please refer to\nit in order to develop yours!\n3.1.7 Costing\nTo be able to set your price and make a finan-\ncial plan, you will need to calculate the cost of\nyour products.\nWhen costing your green goods and services,\nkeep in mind that:\n•\nSome additional investments may be need-\ned in terms of equipment, premises, skills or\nother areas. This will entail additional costs\nat the outset. Specialized equipment may\nbe needed to make the green product/deliv-\ner the green service, or, instead of standard\nequipment, you may wish to opt for more\nefficient equipment which you may need to\nbuy. You may also make green choices for\nyour premises (such as the installation of\nLED lights) or for your sources of energy (for\nexample, solar energy) which will have a cost\nimplication.\n•\nBut, you can also make savings through these\ninvestments in terms of operation cost. For\nexample, the use of solar panels will cut your\nbill in terms of regular electricity.\n•\nOther green choices that you may make,\nsuch as buying second-hand equipment or\nfurniture for your business may also help you\nto lower the cost of your product.\nWhen costing, consider also the cost of an\nenvironmental impact assessment, an envi-\nronmental certification if you opt for one, and\nother similar costs. These will give you an add-\ned marketing advantage later, but their cost\nneeds to be included when doing your initial\ncosting.\n3.1.8 Financial planning\nYou need to be able to plan and monitor the\nfinancial situation of your business. You can\ndo so by making a profit plan and a cash flow\nplan and checking the actual performance of\nthe business against these plans.\nLike any other business, your green business\nneeds to perform financially, otherwise you will\nnot be able to keep it going, no matter how\nnoble its objective. Therefore, make sure to be\nthorough in your financial planning.\n•\n•\n•\n•\n3.1.9 Required start-up capital\nWhen estimating the required start-up capital,\nyou will need to assess your needs in terms of:\nCapital investment: business premises,\nequipment, and furniture.\nWorking capital: the stock of raw materials\nand finished products, marketing costs, sal-\naries, rent, insurance and other costs.\nConsider the elements required for your busi-\nness to be green while estimating this cost. In\nparticular, keep in mind that:\n•\nSome green investments will entail addition-\nal costs at the outset, as mentioned in the\nsection on costing, above.\nHowever, these green investments will usu-\nally pay off in the long term thanks to lower\noperating costs.\nFurthermore, other green choices that you\nmay make, such as buying second-hand fur-\nniture for your business, may also help you\nto lower the start-up capital that is required.\nIn terms of other costs, consider also wheth-\ner you have to budget for an environmental\nimpact assessment, an environmental certifi-\ncation if you opt for one, and other costs that\nmay arise such as contracting an energy ex-\npert. As mentioned in the section on costing\nabove, these will be beneficial for your busi-\nness, but their cost needs to be kept in mind\nwhile budgeting.\nIn estimating the required start-up capital,\nbe realistic in assessing the capital needed to\nsustain your green business up to a time when\nyou make enough money to cover your expens-\nes and make a profit.\nExercise:\nThink about the additional costs and savings\nresulting from greening your processes. Does\nit make financial sense to go green?\n•\nADDITIONAL COSTS\nTHAT MAY BE INCURRED\nBECAUSE OF GREENING\nYOUR PROCESSES:\nSAVINGS THAT CAN\nBE MADE THANKS\nTO GREENING YOUR\nPROCESSES:\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 19\n3.1.10 Sources of start-up\ncapital\nThe most important types of start-up capital\nare owner’s equity and loans.\nKeep in mind that there are also a number of\ninstitutions with special funds for green busi-\nnesses. In some countries green businesses\ncan also earn money through incentives de-\nsigned to encourage greener business prac-\ntices.

Chap-\nter 2 on green business ideas will provide use-\nful tips for doing so.\nBut even when continuing to offer convention-\nal products or services, existing enterprises\ncan also go green by making their processes\nenvironmentally friendly.\nThis chapter is related to this second strategy.\nIt explains what is meant by the greening of\nprocesses, and provides practical guidance on\nhow to do so.\nThough this chapter is intended for existing\nentrepreneurs, it will also be relevant for those\nwho are in the process of starting a business,\nas the environmental management system cov-\nered in it complements the business plan for\nstarting entrepreneurs from the Chapter 3. In\na similar way, existing entrepreneurs should\nalso refer to Chapter 3 as revisiting certain el-\nements of their already established business\nplan from an environmental angle will be use-\nful when going green.\n4.1 What is greening and\nhow can you green your\nprocesses?\nGood waste management practices help businesses to reduce costs, and\nsometimes even enables them to make extra money as recyclables are\nsought-after material.\nYou will recall from Chapter 1 that a business\ncan be a green business in two different ways:\n•\n•\nBy offering products or services that are en-\nvironmentally friendly.\nThrough environmentally friendly business/\nproduction processes, even when offering\nconventional products or services.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 21\nGreening your processes refers to the transfor-\nmation of the business/production processes\nof your enterprise in order for it to become a\ngreen business.\nEvery enterprise can green its operations and\nprocesses. There are two dimensions to this.\nOn the one hand, it concerns the inputs re-\nquired and on the other hand, it concerns the\nunintended output or waste and pollution. So,\ngreening your processes aims both at:\n•\nIncreasing the efficiency of inputs used in\nthe enterprise, i.e. reducing the use of en-\n•\nergy, material and water while increasing or\nmaintaining the same level of product or ser-\nvice delivery;\nReducing the amount of unintended output,\ni.e. reducing waste, pollution and the exces-\nsive destruction of natural resources.\nExercise:\nRead the case study below and think of the in-\nputs and outputs of the business, and whether\nthey could be greener.\nGreening the Cutting Edge Clothes (CEC) company*\nCutting Edge Clothes (CEC) is a T-shirt manufacturer with 30 workers in a small town in Bangladesh.\nThey buy cotton imported from India, dye it with dyes imported from China, and cut and sew it\ninto its final shape.\nThey operate in a building that was previously a school class room and which had the advantage\nof already being connected to the city’s electricity grid and sewage system.\nThe T-shirts are sent to the capital city, 500 km away, in a rented truck in lots of 20-50 T-shirts\nseveral times a month depending on the requirements of their 3 buyers.\nINPUT (RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY,\nIS THE INPUT GREEN? ETC.):\nCOULD THE INPUT BE GREENER?\nARE THERE LIKELY TO BE ANY UNINTENDED\nOUTPUTS WHICH HARM THE ENVIRONMENT?\nHOW COULD THESE UNINTENDED OUTPUTS\nBE AVOIDED:\n*A fictional company made up for this exercise\n22 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n4.2 Tips for greening your\nprocesses\nIn the exercise above, you will have thought\nof many ways of making the processes of a\nbusiness greener. Here are some further tips\non how to go green:\n•\n•\n•\n•\nPay attention to your raw materials: When\nselecting your raw materials, think sustaina-\nble. This may mean organic, biodegradable,\nrecyclable or renewable. Organic agricultur-\nal products, biodegradable plastic, or wood\nfrom sustainable forestry are examples of\nraw materials that make your business foot-\nprint greener.\nGreen your energy and water consumption:\nYour business is likely to require energy and/\nor water. You can go green by using energy\nfrom renewable sources such as solar energy,\nand by using harvested rainwater, for exam-\nple. You can also reduce your energy con-\nsumption by making use of more energy-ef-\nficient equipment. Energy and water usage\ncan also be minimised by technologies that\nhelp you to use as little as possible, such\nas light switches or taps with sensors. These\nchanges are good for the environment, but\nthey are also good for your business: the less\nyou use, the less you spend!\nMinimise your emissions: Switch to fuels\nthat are as green as possible and use equip-\nment that produces the smallest amount\nof emissions possible. Sometimes a switch\nfrom a diesel generator to an electric ma-\nchine reduces costs while cleaning the local\nair. In case of any remaining emissions, look\ninto appropriate filtration technologies.\nReduce, reuse and recycle waste: Reduce by\nusing as little as possible. Could your product\nbe packaged with less material, for example?\nReuse whatever can be reused. Your raw ma-\nterials may be supplied to you in packaging\nthat you can in turn reuse for packaging your\nown product. For waste that you can’t reuse\nyourself or provide to others for reuse, give\nit in for recycling. In many cities, waste col-\nlectors will pay for your recyclables, so don’t\nmiss the opportunity! Finally, for waste that\ncannot be reused or recycled, dispose of it in\na responsible way.\n•\n•\nTransport responsibly: Minimise distances\nused for transport, reduce weight and vol-\nume through efficient packaging options,\navoid less than full loads, plan efficient\njourneys, and when transporting, choose the\nleast environmentally harmful options avail-\nable. Also think of sharing transport with\nothers when possible.\nThink outside of the box: Use your creativity\nto make a profit while helping the environ-\nment. Eco-entrepreneurs tend to be inno-\nvators. Sometimes, sophisticated technolo-\ngies, scientific expertise or a large amount\nof money are needed to make an innovative\nidea a reality. But sometimes you can also\nuse resources that are already available in\nyour community and transform them to\nmake a profit. You may have heard of inno-\nvative ideas such as eco-coolers made from\ndiscarded plastic bottles, or cups and plates\nmade from coffee grinds, or even of entre-\npreneurs creating services from products:\nbecause a consumer is often interested in\nthe quality of the service (e.g. light) rather\nthan the product itself (e.g. a lantern), entre-\npreneurs have started selling light by charg-\ning solar lanterns during the day and bring-\ning them fully-charged to households in the\nevening. Be creative in your thinking and you\nmay become an eco-innovator too!\nEASY WAYS TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND\nYOUR BUSINESS: THE 3R STRATEGY\nIf you manage your waste using the 3R\nstrategy, you can help the environment:\n•\nReduce: The creation of waste can be min-\nimized by reducing our consumption. We\ncan buy less, and we can buy more durable\nproducts that last longer, meaning less new\nproducts and less waste.\n•\n•\nReuse: We can also reuse things in another\nway to diminish the amount of waste we pro-\nduce. Old objects can be re-used in a differ-\nent way instead of being thrown away.\nRecycle: When reduction or reuse are not\npossible, recycling can be used to produce\nnew raw materials from waste; in this way,\nwaste is not simply disposed of, and in\naddition, raw materials do not need to be\nextracted from the natural environment for\nthe creation of new products.\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 23\nThough the above are the most commonly used\nbasic 3 “R”s, even more “R”s can be added\nto the strategy: “Rot” is sometimes added to\nbring in composting as a way of dealing with or-\nganic waste, and “Repair” is a useful means of\nextending the life of many products if broken.\nAll these “R”s have a positive business implica-\ntion. You can save money by reducing the amount\nof inputs you are using, and by reusing whatever\ncan be reused. In some countries, the disposal of\nwaste also results in taxes/fines which a proper\nseparation of waste can avoid. Finally, not only\ncan you save money this way, but by selling your\nwaste to those who are in the business of recy-\ncling or equipment you no longer need to others\nwho are looking for the same type of equipment,\nsometimes you can even make money!\nSAVING THROUGH GREENING\nDid you know you can save money by being\nenvironmentally friendly? Here are a few ex-\namples of how you can help the environment\nand cut costs at the same time:\n•\n•\nReduce usage. Cutting costs and reducing\nbills can be as easy as only using electricity\nand water when you really need it. Installing\ntaps with sensors or automatic light switches\nhelps you do this.\nGo for efficient choices. For example, in\nterms of energy use, by choosing energy-ef-\nficient lighting options such as LED and\nCFL lights instead of the more traditional in-\ncandescent light bulbs, you can reduce the\namount of energy you use by 50 percent or\nmore because of their efficiency. In monetary\nterms, replacing a traditional light bulb with\na CFL of the same brightness will save you\nabout USD 7 per year, or USD 87 over the\nlifetime of the bulb. Think of this when set-\nting up your business premises and choosing\nequipment!\n•\nSwitch sources. For example, start using\nsolar energy instead of regular energy.\nYou’ll need to pay for the installation of\nsolar panels, but once you’ve done this,\nyou’ll have access to a source of energy\nthat is free.\nThink about how much you could save if\nyou would implement some of these meas-\nures in your business!\nSources: http://yourenergysavings.gov.au/ ; http://\nwww.energysavingtrust.org.uk/home-energy-effi-\nciency/lighting\n24 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n4.3 Greening in practice:\nYour environmental\nmanagement system\nIn order to green your business, it is helpful to\ndevelop a simple environmental management\nsystem.\nTo do this, you can follow the steps below:\n•\n•\n•\nAssess your current situation. How well are\nyou performing in terms of environmen-\ntal-friendliness? Are there any areas in which\nyou could do better? To do this, you can use\nthe greening checklist below.\nPlan your greening measures. You will not\nbe able to do everything at once. Decide on\npriorities, think about what each possible\nmeasure will cost, and set realistic timelines\nfor achieving your priority action. You can\nuse the greening plan below to develop your\nown plan.\nMonitor regularly. As we are busy in our day-\nto-day lives, we often forget the goals we\nset earlier. Make sure to go back to your as-\nsessment and plan once in a while to check\nwhether you are on track!\n4.3.1 Assess\nAdapt and use the greening checklist below to assess your current situation.\nGreening checklist:\nDO YOU: Y N N/A GREENING\nMEASURE:\nGREEN\nUse environmentally friendly materials?\n(recycled, recyclable, second-hand, organic,\nnatural, biodegradable…)\nPROCUREMENT\nUse locally available materials?\nUse suppliers which try to be environmentally\nfriendly?\nENERGY\nAND WATER\nCONSERVATION\nUse electricity from renewable sources?\nUse efficient equipment?\nUse only as much electricity as needed?\nUse water from renewable sources (such as harvested\nrainwater)?\nUse only as much water as needed?\nPOLLUTION\nPREVENTION IN\nPRODUCTION/\nSERVICE\nPROVISION\nUse low-emission equipment?\nOperate efficiently?\nAvoid the use of hazardous chemicals or other sub-\nstances that can cause air, soil or water pollution?\nMinimize the entry of pollutants into the environment\nthrough measures like air or water filtration?\nReduce as much as possible?\nReuse as much as possible?\nRECYCLING\nRecycle as much as possible?\nAND WASTE\nREDUCTION\nCompost whatever can be composted?\nGREEN\nDISTRIBUTION\nSeparate waste?\nDispose what needs to be disposed of in a safe and\nsuitable way?\nAvoid transport to far-away destinations?\nAvoid transporting individual items/small sets of\nitems?\nUse the least-polluting modes of transport possible?\nOTHER\nUse transport providers which try to be environmen-\ntally friendly?\nIn your premises, do you have furniture that is\nsecond-hand or made of renewable or recyclable\nmaterials?\nDo you share equipment with others when possible?\nDo you (and your employees) get to work in an\neco-friendly way? (walking, cycling, car pooling…)\nGREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\n| 25\n4.3.2 Plan\n•\nPrioritise\nBased on the assessment above, you will\nhave identified a number of possible greening\nmeasures.\nAs you cannot do everything at once, you will\nneed to decide on where to start. In order to\nhelp you decide on priority actions to start\nwith, you can use the prioritisation matrix.\nFill it in for your business using the following\nsymbols:\n++ Very positive/very easy\n+ Positive/easy\n0 Neither positive/easy nor negative/difficult\n-\nNegative/difficult\n- - Very negative/very difficult\n•\nPlan\nBased on the prioritisation exercise above,\nmake a greening plan. Decide on what needs\nto be done by when and by whom, how much\nit will cost and how the cost can be covered.\nIt is important to be realistic when planning.\nEven if an action might have a very positive en-\nvironmental and business impact, if you do not\nhave the resources to implement it, you may\nneed to start with other actions while working\ntowards getting the resources required for it.\nAdapt and use the greening plan for greening\nyour business.\n4.3.3 Monitor\nIt is important that you revisit your assess-\nment and plan on a regular basis. We all get\nbusy and sometimes forget the goals we had\nset earlier, so ensure that you regularly re-as-\nsess your business.\n26 | GREEN BUSINESS BOOKLET\nPrioritisation matrix:\nGREENING\nMEASURE\nIMPACT\nON YOUR\nBUSINESS\nIMPACT ON\nTHE ENVI-\nRONMENT\nEASE OF\nDOING\nEASE OF\nFINANCING\nBased on your answers, you will see that some\nmeasures are more important than others in\nterms of impact, and some are easier to do and\nto finance than others. You will need to find a\nbalance between what is important and what\nis realistic. Look at your table and prioritise\nbased on it.\nGreening plan:\nGREENING\nMEASURE\nWHEN\nWILL IT BE\nDONE?\nWHO WILL\nDO IT?\nHOW MUCH\nWILL IT\nCOST?\nHOW CAN\nTHE COST\nCOST BE\nCOVERED?\nTo make sure you are on track, go through\nyour greening checklist and greening plan\nonce every six months.

You've integrated resource efficiency concepts in a subtle way that encourages participants to discover these principles through experience rather than direct instruction.

Flight performance (distance, accuracy)\n  2. Design appeal and uniqueness\n  3. Resource efficiency (how effectively materials were used)\n- These factors will determine the selling price ($2-$20 per plane)\n\n55 Minutes: Activity\n\n10 minutes: Design Phase\n- Teams develop their airplane concept and prototype\n- Encourage teams to conduct \"customer research\" by asking what the buyer values\n- Teams should consider: How can we design a plane that maximizes quality while minimizing material use?\n\n10 minutes: Pitch & Pricing\n- Each team presents their plane and demonstrates flight capabilities\n- Trainers evaluate and set a price based on performance, design, and efficiency\n- Trainers should reward innovative resource efficiency (e.g., higher price for designs that use minimal material)\n\n15 Minutes: Production Phase\n- Teams have 10 minutes to produce multiple planes using their initial materials\n- After 5 minutes, announce: \"Market demand has increased! A buyer wants 25 planes instead of 15\"\n- Teams can purchase additional materials if needed, but this cuts into profit margins\n- Extend production time by 5 minutes\n\n15 Minutes: Evaluation & Discussion\n- Calculate profits: (Number of accepted planes × Price) - (Materials cost)\n- Rejected planes don't generate revenue, but still count as material cost\n- Discuss which teams were most profitable and why\n\nFacilitator note: Watch for teams that develop resource-efficient strategies like making multiple planes from one sheet, minimizing waste, or repurposing scraps. Point these out during discussion as successful business innovations.\n```\n\n## New Discussion Points for Slide 4: WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?\n\nAdd these questions to the \"Potential questions to ask\" section:\n\n```\n• How did material constraints affect your design decisions?\n• Did any teams find ways to create multiple planes from one sheet? How did this affect your profitability?\n• How did teams handle the sudden increase in demand? Did you have to buy more materials or find ways to stretch what you had?\n• What strategies did the most profitable teams use to balance quality and resource efficiency?\n• How does this exercise relate to real business challenges around resource management?\n```\n\nAdd these points to the \"Possible learning outcomes\" section:\n\n```\n• Resource efficiency directly impacts profitability - teams that created more value from fewer materials generally earned more\n• Smart design thinking upfront can reduce material needs and waste throughout production\n• Businesses face tension between quality, speed, and resource use - finding the optimal balance is key\n• Adaptability in the face of changing demands often requires rethinking resource allocation\n• Sustainability (using resources efficiently) and profitability often go hand-in-hand\n```\n\n## Enhancement to Slide 5: DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\n\nAdd this bullet under \"Research, Design, and Development\":\n\n```\n• Design for efficiency: How did your initial design choices impact your ability to produce efficiently?\n• Some teams may have created designs that were beautiful but used too much material or were too complex to reproduce quickly\n• Others may have created simpler designs that could be produced quickly with minimal waste\n• This is exactly what businesses must consider - a product's design determines both its resource requirements and production efficiency\n```\n\n---\n\nThis revised activity creates a genuine business simulation where resource efficiency emerges naturally as a competitive advantage. Rather than explicitly teaching about environmental concepts, it allows participants to discover that efficient resource use is simply good business.\n\nThe structure encourages creative problem-solving around resource constraints while maintaining the fun, competitive aspect of the original activity. Importantly, it doesn't require any new materials or complicated setup - just a subtle shift in emphasis and scoring.\n\nWould you like me to make any additional refinements to better integrate this with the client's goals?",
