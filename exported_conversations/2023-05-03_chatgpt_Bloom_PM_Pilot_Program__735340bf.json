Why would Bloom be more adapted vs. another entity that would be specialised in that.\nIn the document for Wise, you have a section called \"The Bloom Method\" which is where I would put this info. You need to show that Bloom is a champion in that.\n> Maybe some facts (\"X team members in X countries working remotely for X years\", \"tested several approaches and refined our methods years after years\", \"understood the need for tailor-made solutions depending on the teams and the needs of that team\", ...)\nActually maybe add at the beginning or at the end a strong conviction about the subject - (brainstorming here) \"Remote team culture is not a one-time, one-tool, fix. It requires holisticity, customization and continuous improvement.\" >> we can ask Chat GPT to make it better.\nBut basically making them anxious about it and reassuring them because we know our shit :)\"\n\nCan you update the presentation with the feedback, make sure to give me the output in nice markup",
