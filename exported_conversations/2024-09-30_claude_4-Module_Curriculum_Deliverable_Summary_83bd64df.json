ITC is 100% \"Aid for Trade\", supporting trade that\ndelivers inclusive and sustainable development results. ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and\ntransition economies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs) Fragile States and Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. To support a more inclusive distribution of development gains, ITC works with women, youth, and\nmarginalized groups in developing countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that\nprovide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation.\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq, implemented by UN-Habitat, the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent\nwork and affordable housing. This multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive\ninvestment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq's National Public Works Programme, enhancing\ncapacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting trade-led private sector engagement in climate-\nsmart construction, and empowering social partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these\ncomponents, BEIT focuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools and\nlegislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social dialogue and capacity building\namong social partners, all to address housing challenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating\nclimate change impacts in the housing sector.\nOutput 3.3 of the project is designed to enhance the capabilities of local businesses, particularly focusing\non young entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative practices into their operations. This includes a\ncomprehensive approach to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the\ndevelopment of sustainable and innovative capabilities, especially in sectors like climate-smart solutions\nand innovative construction technology.

The modules are designed to enhance skills in sustainable housing, retrofitting, and reconstruction, with a strong focus on practical application, participatory learning, and peer-based activities. Each module combines theoretical knowledge with applied exercises to help participants build expertise that can lead to employment opportunities or inspire innovations in sustainable housing. This curriculum is aligned with the goals of the Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project, including fostering affordable housing and supporting climate-smart construction in Iraq.\n\nModules Overview and Connection to Next-Stage Opportunities\n\nModule 1: Sustainable Foundations—Building Resilient Homes for Iraq’s Future\n\nThis module provides foundational knowledge on Iraq's sustainability challenges and green building solutions. Participants will conduct a home energy assessment to apply what they have learned.\nNext-Stage Opportunity: Connects with Climate Advisors for career opportunities in green construction and sustainability fields.\nModule 2: Solar Energy and Energy Modeling\n\nThis module focuses on the application of solar energy, including designing a theoretical solar system for homes and calculating investment recuperation.\nNext-Stage Opportunity: Leads into specialized learning on solar heating, solar electricity, and sustainable AC with partners like Mosul Solar or Kesk.\nModule 3: Insulation and Ventilation\n\nParticipants will analyze the thermal properties of their homes, apply cool roof techniques, and assess their impact to make informed decisions on energy efficiency.\nNext-Stage Opportunity: Collaborates with Sika for advanced training and employment opportunities in insulation and ventilation solutions.\nModule 4: Heritage-Inspired Innovation—Study the Past, Build the Future\n\nThis module leverages heritage architecture as a basis for developing innovative solutions. It includes a design thinking session that guides participants through an innovation process.\nNext-Stage Opportunity: Concludes with showcasing participants’ projects during the \"Job Fair and Demo Day,\" providing exposure to potential employers and stakeholders.\nIntegration with \"Job Fair and Demo Day\"\nThe curriculum integrates a quarterly \"Job Fair and Demo Day\" to provide participants with networking opportunities, internships, and additional training prospects. This event also serves as a platform for participants to showcase the projects they developed during the training modules, connecting them to the broader ecosystem and potential employment opportunities.\n\nPrinciples of the Curriculum\n\nApplied Learning Beyond Rote Memorization\nEach module is designed with a balance between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Participants are required to conduct analyses, such as energy audits or thermal property assessments, and to articulate their findings and ideas in presentations, building both their technical skills and their communication abilities.\n\nParticipatory and Peer-Based Learning\nThe modules are interactive and emphasize peer-to-peer learning. Group discussions and participatory exercises are core elements of the training, fostering collaboration, critical thinking, and collective problem-solving.\n\nLearning from the Past to Innovate for the Future\nA core principle of the curriculum is \"looking back to look forward.\" Module 4 highlights how heritage architecture offers sustainable solutions that can inspire modern innovations, guiding participants through a rapid design thinking process to translate historical practices into future-oriented innovations.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the training, each module includes quizzes designed to track learning outcomes and gather key metrics for monitoring progress. These quizzes provide insights into participants' comprehension and areas for further improvement, supporting both learning and evaluation.\n\nPartnership Development and Lead Implementing Partners\nIdentifying lead implementing partners for each module is underway, involving numerous stakeholder meetings, both in person and virtually. This engagement has shown promising progress, and we are confident that we will identify the right partners to help enhance curriculum delivery and outcomes.\n\nCurriculum Duration\nEach module is designed to take between one and three days, depending on the hours available per day, providing flexibility in implementation to meet the needs of different groups."

ITC is 100% \"Aid for Trade\", supporting trade that\ndelivers inclusive and sustainable development results. ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and\ntransition economies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs) Fragile States and Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. To support a more inclusive distribution of development gains, ITC works with women, youth, and\nmarginalized groups in developing countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that\nprovide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation.\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq, implemented by UN-Habitat, the\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent\nwork and affordable housing. This multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive\ninvestment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq's National Public Works Programme, enhancing\ncapacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting trade-led private sector engagement in climate-\nsmart construction, and empowering social partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these\ncomponents, BEIT focuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools and\nlegislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social dialogue and capacity building\namong social partners, all to address housing challenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating\nclimate change impacts in the housing sector.\nOutput 3.3 of the project is designed to enhance the capabilities of local businesses, particularly focusing\non young entrepreneurs, to incorporate green and innovative practices into their operations. This includes a\ncomprehensive approach to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) through the\ndevelopment of sustainable and innovative capabilities, especially in sectors like climate-smart solutions\nand innovative construction technology. The project plans to:\n1. Reinforce Business Development Services: Strengthening the portfolio of service providers to offer\ntraining, coaching, and mentoring in areas critical for sustainable and innovative business practices.\n2.
