Pre-Post Assessments and Certificates Brief\nDecember 2023\nKey Docs\nCertificates Notes / Discussions (Apr 2023) (Start Here)\nBloom Certificates & Credentials Exploration (internal draft)\nIndividual Pillar Assessments and Questions\nNotes\nLeadership Frameworks\nLeadership Behaviours\nIntroduction to The Leadership Framework\n\nJan 24, 2024: Bilal research\nFrom the entrepass website I found :https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=738&langId=en&pubId=8504&furtherPubs=yes it looks important to review - they did a large analysis of the projects out there. Didn’t dig deep enough. Review this.\n\nVery interesting review of entrepreneurship assessments out there and the styles of questions they use, found in this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311364219_PROMOTING_THE_ENTREPRENEURSHIP_COMPETENCE_OF_YOUNG_ADULTS_IN_EUROPE_TOWARDS_A_SELF-ASSESSMENT_TOOL\n\n\n4 types of validity:\nhttps://codesignal.com/blog/tech-recruiting/assessment-validation-and-why-its-a-game-changer-for-your-tech-hiring/\n1. Internal content validation\nJob analysis: To start, a comprehensive job analysis is conducted to identify the critical knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) required for the role. This often involves interviews with subject matter experts, observation of job tasks, or even a review of existing job descriptions.\nAssessment development: Based on the information gathered during the job analysis, the assessment developers create questions that align with the identified job requirements. \nQuestion review: Before the assessment goes live, subject matter experts (SMES) review assessment questions and refine them to ensure they are accurate, relevant, and free of potential biases.\nPilot testing: The assessment is then administered to a small sample of individuals, who are ideally SMEs. This allows the assessment developers to collect data on the assessment’s performance and make any necessary adjustments.\nOngoing monitoring and evaluation: Assessment researchers need to keep evaluating content validity as industry trends and needs shift. They also need to monitor opportunities for cheating, which reduces the validity of an assessment.\n2. External content validation\nExternal content validation addresses to what extent your coding questions—or assessments as a whole—are relevant to the role and the company you’re hiring for. An assessment for a front-end engineering role, for instance, should include coding questions that ask candidates to render UX designs, handle dynamic interactions, and work with an API, among other key front-end development skills.\n3. Criterion validation\nCriterion validation—and more specifically, predictive validity—examines the relationship between a candidate’s score on a pre-hire assessment and their later job performance. If a candidate scores highly on a pre-hire assessment, for instance, they should perform well in the role they’re hired for, assuming there is strong predictive validity. \nCriterion validation like predictive validity, while time-intensive, establishes additional legal defensibility for pre-hire assessments by ensuring their job-relevance. \n4. Face validity\n\nGIZ wants to help govs validate formal/informal skills and has a team to help:\nhttps://www.giz.de/expertise/downloads/giz2023-en-validation-of-skills-in-vocational-training.pdf\n\nInteresting insights on self confidence and validating skills. Some people need help validating skills they learned outside formal training. \nAlso, the development of “evidence” and portfolios takes time. It might be a good thing to do though. Perhaps rather than an “assessment” we work with them to create a portfolio of evidence and the “assessment form” compiles the content and produces the PDF, sort of like at the bridge for billions tool\n Validation of non-formal and informal learning | CEDEFOP\n\nWas presented at: \nLet’s go next year, haha!\n\n\nSkillable is bullish on AI:\nhttps://www.skillable.com/resources/skill-validation-development/the-impact-of-ai-on-skills-validation/\n\nEuropass skills transfer is interesting to watch: https://europa.eu/europass/en\n\n\nLarge skills assessment library/company raised 15 mil to continue building it out: https://www.imocha.io/tests/leadership-assessment-test\n\nSkills need to be verified before visa applications, let’s see how they do that:\nhttps://visaenvoy.com/skills-priority-list/\nInteresting to see what skills are needed, i wonder if we can gather that from many countries\n\nAlso, australia seems to have a department in their gov working on skills:\nhttps://www.asqa.gov.au/resources/videos-and-webinars/webinar-spotlight-assessment-validation\nThey work with you to accredit courses..\nThey also help training orgs in many ways.

Outcome-Based Assessment focuses on the end results of the learning process, evaluating what learners can actually do with the knowledge and skills they have acquired. This approach is particularly relevant for entrepreneurial skills, as it emphasizes practical application and real-world impact. Here are some key types of OBAs used for assessing entrepreneurial skills:\nBusiness Plan Development and Presentation:\nLearners create a comprehensive business plan and present it. This assesses their ability to conceive, plan, and articulate a business idea, covering market analysis, financial planning, and strategy.\nSimulations and Role-Playing Exercises:\nParticipants engage in simulations that mimic real-life entrepreneurial challenges. This can include handling a startup scenario, responding to market changes, or pitching to investors.\nProject-Based Learning (PBL):\nLearners undertake a project where they must apply entrepreneurial skills to develop a product or service, manage a team, or execute a small business venture.\nPortfolio Assessments:\nLearners compile a portfolio of work that demonstrates their entrepreneurial skills. This can include business plans, marketing strategies, financial analyses, and reflective essays on their learning journey.\nCase Study Analysis:\nAssessment based on the analysis of real-world business cases, where learners must apply their entrepreneurial knowledge to solve problems, make decisions, or recommend strategies.\nSelf and Peer Assessments:\nLearners and their peers assess each other’s entrepreneurial skills based on group projects or collaborative tasks. This can include feedback on leadership, teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.\nCompetitions and Challenges:\nOrganizing or participating in entrepreneurial competitions or challenges where learners pitch ideas, develop prototypes, or present business solutions to real-world problems.\nReflection and Self-Evaluation:\nEncouraging learners to reflect on their own entrepreneurial journey, challenges faced, and learning outcomes. This can be done through journals, blogs, or reflective essays.\n360-Degree Feedback:\nGathering feedback from multiple sources, including instructors, peers, industry mentors, or even potential customers, to evaluate learners’ entrepreneurial skills.\n\n\nAnother way we can assess things is by doing multiple things and people needing to take the self assessment, review it with someone else, and get the feedback into our credentialing system for them to be able to have “proof” - maybe it can be on the community platform, or somewhere public. A test as well as other things, and all that can go together to create a badge sort of like this: \nhttps://learn.ibm.com/files/analytics/DAELL/DAELL-Badge-Program/data_science/index.html\n\nI think this is why we should have a badge. We can even have different “gradients” of badges\nRather than simply having a pre/post - what we can say is that we have disbursed X badges \nThis resolves some issues\nIf the badge for “Entrepreneur in progress” (or a better name) is someone who took the assessment, and then learned a bunch o fthings and took it again and needed to reassess their levels on the assessment, and then discussed it with a coach who then sent us a report which unlocks their credential… that can be cool. For our funders we can have a credentials overview page which can be a sort of outcomes page - rather than the dashboard we were doing before all numerical yet not so meaningful because the numbers were self reported. This badge system can both have a number of badges out in the wild, as well as have each badge say how they got there. And also, they’d contain their own pudding as proof inside themselves because they’re delicious. It’s late, sorry Dara. haha\n\n\nThought I’d check into what the French are doing, maybe Dara can figure it out better than google translate and Bilal, haha:\nhttps://travail--emploi-gouv-fr.translate.goog/formation-professionnelle/certification-competences-pro/?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc\n\n\nInteresting to see this approach to download a domain expert’s knowledge and make  test out of it:\nhttps://www.testgorilla.com/test-library/situational-judgment-tests/leadership-people-management-test/\n\n\n\nFound that there are domain specific skill verification organizations, for example:\nNurses are working on it: \nStandardizing Assessment of Competences and Competencies of Oncology Nurses Working in Ambulatory Care\n\nMulti party collaboration alignment on skills / skills database:\nhttps://www.transvalproject.eu/downloads/\n\nPDF I found which I thought had an interesting six component framework for the competencies our future civilization requires.

Their recommendations:\nThe challenges identified are by no mean insurmountable. However, they need increased\nefforts by PES, to build comprehensive and effective skills-based services. It is\nrecommended that PES:\n- Strengthen the skills-centred cooperation of stakeholders. Skills-based\nservices (including skills assessment, validation and recognition, and skills-based\ntraining) require participation of numerous bodies, stakeholders and actors, who\nshould cooperate closely. In particular, cooperation regarding the validation and\nrecognition of skills between PES and the education sector, including training and\nvalidation providers, is crucial for the effectiveness of skills-related activities. PES\nshould play an active (possibly coordinating) role to stimulate skills validation\namong multiple actors involved in this process.\n- Support green and digital transitions through skills development. Skills\nassessment and recognition procedures should lead to the development of\naccessible reskilling and upskilling pathways towards the twin transition, with the\naim of securing future employment for interested individuals. PES should continue\nto play an active role in supporting just transitions, greening of European economies\nand the development of much-needed digital skills.\n\n- Ensure establishment of transparent procedures for data protection and\nsharing of personal data. Personal data on skills is sensitive; as a rule, access to\nthem is provided to the individual and PES staff. However, it needs to be shared in\na safe and trustworthy way among all relevant stakeholders, especially PES and\neducation and training bodies, potential employers or institutions involved in the\nrecognition and validation of skills. As such, procedures for data protection and\nsharing are the backbone of the skills-based support system.\n- Increase accessibility and availability of skills-based activities and\nsupport. Notably, although some elements of skills-based processes (e.g., skills\nassessment) are well-established in PES, more efforts need to be made to increase\naccessibility for interested individuals. This requires not only streamlining the skills-\nbased perspective into PES services (which often means changing from an\noccupational to a skills perspective), but also dissemination actions among potential\nusers. As jobseekers and employment counsellors can be hesitant to use a skills-\nbased approach, there is a need to build trust and knowledge of these processes.\n- Develop skills-based taxonomies and services. An important challenge for\nskills assessment, validation and recognition stems from the inadequate\ndevelopment of a relevant taxonomy that is skills-based rather than occupational.\nCommon language – especially in terms of skills taxonomy – is crucial to the skills-\nrelated processes of matching and other PES services. The transition from an\noccupation-based to a skills-based approach also requires initiatives to change the\nexisting PES culture and ensure and support the application by PES staff.\n- Explore further the potential of micro-credentials as a form of skills-based\ntraining. Micro-credentials are a relatively new tool for most PES, but they show\nsignificant potential as a form of training intervention. In order to function\neffectively, they need to be embedded in other elements of the skills-focused\nsystem, including skills-based matching and profiling in PES, as well as qualification\nsystems like National Qualification Frameworks. As micro-credentials are only\nstarting to gain recognition among stakeholders, awareness raising should be an\nimportant activity of PES and other actors.\n\nhttps://www.1edtech.org/certification/procure-certified\nThere is a business who is attempting to do what the EU recommendation says.

The traditional assessment models often encounter the Dunning-Kruger effect, where participants, upon gaining deeper insights into a skill, may paradoxically rate themselves lower post-learning due to an increased awareness of the complexity. This cognitive bias underscores the need for a nuanced approach to self-assessment within skill development programs.\n\nMoreover, as the landscape of skill and organizational development evolves, employers increasingly recognize the limitations of traditional degrees and certificates in capturing the full spectrum of an individual's capabilities. The Dunning-Kruger effect further highlights the necessity for certifications that validate skills objectively and acknowledge the inherent challenges in self-assessment. Certifications, grounded in industry-recognized standards and coupled with evidence-based assessments, are crucial in providing a reliable measure of an individual's proficiency, bridging the gap between self-perception and actual competence. This dual challenge calls for a comprehensive solution that navigates the complexities of individual and organizational development, incorporating the cognitive nuances of self-assessment while offering certifications that truly reflect an individual's capabilities.\nPrinciples\nEmphasize the demonstration of key skills as the primary measure of capability, placing more value on practical evidence than traditional certificates.\nDesign the assessment framework to actively support individuals securing employment by aligning their skills with market demands.\nFoster a culture that inspires individuals to pursue lifelong learning, encouraging continuous improvement and adaptability.\nEstablish clear levels within the assessment framework, allowing individuals to celebrate incremental progress and receive validation or certification at each level attained.\nFacilitate a mechanism for individuals to share their skills, especially with potential employers, and create a reliable skills passport that showcases their capabilities.\nEnable individuals to seamlessly transfer and continue their skills development across different programs and providers.\nSkills passport - related to blockchain\nUBIPASS\nYour global “skills passport.”\nA comprehensive record of your skillset – acquired through work, life, and formal study\nMozilla/UNICEF passport thing\nEnsure a balanced approach to skills development by addressing hard/technical and soft/universal skills.\nAllow learning content from various sources, such as books, courses, lectures, YouTube videos, Bloom modules, etc., to be included in certificate descriptions, fostering a holistic approach to skill acquisition.\nIncorporate a mechanism for 3rd party validation and portfolio presentation in certificates, enhancing credibility and showcasing the practical application of skills.\nVested impact for impact measurement 3d party validation (at Village Capital)\nDesign flexible learning paths that cater to diverse learning styles and preferences, accommodating various modes of skill acquisition.\nImplement a feedback loop to ensure continuous improvement of the assessment framework, adapting to evolving industry needs.\n\nProposed Solution\nWe propose implementing a robust pre- and post-assessment framework that addresses key categories for organizational development and a comprehensive set of skills for individual development.

The approach can vary depending on the nature of the skills and the goals of the assessment. Here are some common methods and considerations for measuring skill development:\nPerformance-Based Assessments: Design tasks or projects that directly assess the practical application of skills. This could involve real-world scenarios or simulated exercises relevant to the measured skill.\nPortfolio Evaluation: Encourage learners to build a portfolio showcasing their work, projects, or achievements related to the targeted skill. Evaluate the portfolio for depth, complexity, and evidence of skill development.\nObjective Assessments: Use standardized tests or quizzes to measure a learner's knowledge and understanding of the theoretical aspects of a skill. This is particularly useful for skills with well-defined concepts and principles.\nObservational Assessments: Incorporate observations by mentors, peers, or experts who can provide valuable insights into a learner's practical application of skills in a real or simulated environment.\nSelf-Assessment and Reflection: Allow learners to self-assess their progress and reflect on their development. This can provide qualitative insights into their perception of skill acquisition and areas for improvement.\nPeer Reviews: Introduce a peer review component where learners evaluate and provide feedback on each other's work. This can foster a collaborative learning environment and provide diverse perspectives on skill development.\nFeedback Loops: Establish continuous feedback mechanisms to gather input from learners, mentors, and other stakeholders. Regular feedback can help identify areas of improvement and guide the learning journey.\nProgress Tracking Metrics: Develop quantitative metrics to track progress over time. This could include the number of completed activities, time spent on skill development, or task complexity.\nThird-Party Assessments: Involve external entities or experts to conduct assessments, adding a layer of objectivity and credibility to the evaluation process.\nPre- Post-Assessment Dunning-Kruger Effect\nThe \"Dunning-Kruger effect\" suggests that individuals with low initial competence tend to overestimate their abilities, while those who have gained some competence may become more aware of the complexity of the skill, leading to a more modest self-assessment. \n\n\nAddressing this issue requires thoughtful communication and framing of the assessments. \nHere's how you might approach it:\nProvide Context and Explanation: Before participants take the post-assessment, provide clear instructions and context for the assessment. Explain that learning often reveals the depth and complexity of a skill, and it's natural for individuals to become more aware of what they don't know.\nEmphasize the Learning Journey: Reinforce the idea that the learning process is a journey, and increased awareness of the intricacies of a skill is a positive sign of growth. Encourage participants to see the post-assessment as a reflection of their enhanced understanding.\nHighlight Positive Progress: Focus on the positive aspects of their progress. Even if they feel they know less than before, it's likely a sign that they now have a deeper appreciation for the nuances of the skill.\nNormalize the Experience: Share that this phenomenon is common and known as the Dunning-Kruger effect. By normalizing the experience, participants may feel more at ease about adjusting their self-assessment.\nEncourage Honest Reflection: Remind participants that honest self-reflection is crucial to learning. Encourage them to think critically about their capabilities and acknowledge areas for improvement.\nReiterate the Purpose of Assessments: Assessments are tools for personal development and not strict proficiency measures. Emphasize that the goal is to identify areas for growth and set realistic improvement targets.\nProvide Post-Assessment Guidance: Offer guidance and resources based on the post-assessment results. This can include targeted learning materials, additional practice opportunities, or access to mentors and experts.\nCelebrate Growth Mindset: Celebrate the adoption of a growth mindset, where participants recognize that there is always more to learn. Emphasize the value of curiosity and ongoing improvement.\nContinuous Learning Opportunities: Reinforce that the learning journey continues after the post-assessment. Encourage participants to continue exploring, practicing, and refining their skills.\nCollect Feedback: Ask for feedback on the assessment process. Understand participants' perceptions and experiences to refine your approach for future assessments.\nBy addressing the Dunning-Kruger effect and framing assessments as tools for learning and growth, you can help participants navigate the cognitive biases associated with self-assessment and promote a more accurate and positive reflection of their skills.\nRisks\nData Security and Privacy:\nEnsure robust measures are in place to safeguard sensitive organizational and individual data.\nAccuracy of Assessments:\nRegularly review and update assessment criteria to maintain accuracy and relevance while maintaining data alignment.\nExpected Outcomes\nHolistic Organizational Development:\nImproved performance in key organizational development categories.\nEnhanced Individual Skills:\nParticipants demonstrate growth in individual skills.\nInformed Decision-Making:\nLeadership gains actionable insights for strategic decision-making based on assessment outcomes.\nRecognition and Motivation:\nIssuance of certificates serves as a motivational tool and recognizes individual and organizational achievements.\n\n\nThe proposed organizational and individual development assessment framework aims to harmonize and diversify how we approach skill enhancement and organizational growth. By implementing this comprehensive solution, we anticipate a positive impact on performance, innovation, and overall success.\n\n\n\n\nAddendums:\nBilal asks how to assess:\nChatGPT\nAssessing universal skills can be challenging, as they are often complex and multifaceted.

However, it's important to recognize that not all skills\ncan be effectively assessed through automation, and that human judgment may still be required in some cases.\nUser\nwhat assessments might need humans, and what assessments might be great for automated assessments?\nChatGPT\nSome universal skills assessments may require human evaluation, while others may be well-suited to automated assessments. Here\nare some examples of assessments that may benefit from human evaluation, as well as assessments that may be well-suited to\nautomation:\nAssessments that may require human evaluation:\n1. Performance assessments that involve open-ended questions or complex problems that require subjective judgment.\n2. Assessments of creativity and innovation that require evaluation of originality, novelty, and impact.\n3. Assessments of collaboration and teamwork that require evaluation of interpersonal skills, such as leadership and conflict\nresolution.\n4. Assessments of emotional intelligence that require evaluation of social skills and the ability to understand and respond to\nthe emotions of others.\nAssessments that may be well-suited to automation:\n1. Standardized tests that measure knowledge of digital tools and technology, which can be automatically scored using software.\n2. Assessments of communication that analyze written or spoken language, such as essays or presentations, using natural\nlanguage processing tools.\n3. Assessments of critical thinking and problem-solving that involve multiple-choice or other standardized questions, which can\nbe automatically scored using software.\n4. Assessments of digital literacy that involve simulated tasks, such as completing an online form or using a spreadsheet,\nwhich can be automatically scored based on the accuracy and efficiency of the task completion.\nOverall, it's important to carefully consider the strengths and limitations of different assessment methods when evaluating\nuniversal skills. Combining both automated and human-based assessments can provide a comprehensive and accurate picture of\nindividuals' skills and abilities.\nUser\ncan you make an table of all universal skills and then two columns, human assessed and digitally assessed and include the way\nto assess inside those columns1/24/24, 2:03 PM ChatGPT Data Export\nfile:///Users/bilalghalib/Projects/ChatGPTExportJul123/chat.html 2433/2535\nChatGPT\nSure, here's a table of the six universal skills and whether they are more suitable for human assessment or digital assessment,\nalong with some examples of how each type of assessment could be conducted:\n| Universal Skill | Human Assessment | Digital Assessment |\n|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Critical thinking and problem-solving | Open-ended problem-solving tasks that require subjective judgment. | Standardized\nmultiple-choice tests that measure problem-solving ability. |\n| Communication | Evaluation of written or spoken language, such as essays or presentations, using rubrics and human judgment.\n| Analysis of written or spoken language, such as essays or presentations, using natural language processing tools. |\n| Collaboration and teamwork | Observations of group interactions and contributions to group projects, using human judgment and\nrubrics. | Analysis of collaboration data, such as communication frequency, response time, and contribution to team goals,\nusing collaboration tools and data analysis software. |\n| Creativity and innovation | Evaluation of creative work, such as music, art, or writing, using subjective judgment based on\ncriteria such as originality, coherence, and impact. | Analysis of creative work, such as music, art, or writing, using machine\nlearning algorithms that evaluate factors such as originality, coherence, and impact. |\n| Digital literacy | Performance assessments that involve simulated tasks, such as completing an online form or using a\nspreadsheet, using human judgment and rubrics. | Standardized tests that measure knowledge of digital tools and technology,\nwhich can be automatically scored using software. |\n| Emotional intelligence | Assessments that measure emotional intelligence through surveys or other tools that measure factors\nsuch as self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills, using human judgment and rubrics. | Assessments that\nmeasure emotional intelligence through surveys or other tools that measure factors such as self-awareness, self-regulation,\nempathy, and social skills, using data analysis software. |\nIt's worth noting that the distinction between human and digital assessment is not always clear-cut, and some assessments may\ninvolve both types of eval\n",

      "content": "To score the competences with minimal human involvement, we can integrate automated systems and innovative approaches. Here are five divergent ideas for automating the scoring process:\n\n1. **AI-Based Text Analysis and Scoring:**\n   - For written tasks such as essays, reports, and reflective journals, use AI-powered text analysis tools. These tools can evaluate the content based on predefined criteria such as relevance, coherence, use of specific concepts, and complexity. Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms can assign scores based on the depth and quality of the content.\n   - Example: An AI system evaluates a reflective essay on personal goals and aspirations, scoring based on the depth of reflection, goal clarity, and use of specific self-awareness concepts.\n\n2. **Interactive Simulations with Embedded Analytics:**\n   - Utilize interactive simulations for tasks like crisis management, project planning, or ethical dilemma resolution. These simulations can automatically record and analyze decisions, strategies, and outcomes. Embedded analytics can score the participant’s performance based on predefined metrics such as decision-making quality, resource management, and problem-solving effectiveness.\n   - Example: In a crisis management simulation, the system scores the participant based on their ability to minimize impact, resource allocation efficiency, and decision-making under pressure.\n\n3. **Digital Portfolios with Automated Review Tools:**\n   - Encourage participants to create digital portfolios that include videos, project documents, and presentations. Use automated review tools that can analyze these digital artifacts for specific criteria like innovation, technical skills, and presentation quality. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize high-quality work and assign scores.\n   - Example: An AI tool reviews a digital portfolio, scoring on the innovativeness of a project, the technical proficiency displayed, and the effectiveness of the presentation.\n\n4. **Peer Review Platforms with Structured Feedback:**\n   - Implement a peer review system where participants evaluate each other's work based on structured, standardized criteria. While this involves human evaluators, the process is streamlined and standardized through an automated platform that aggregates scores and feedback, minimizing manual processing.\n   - Example: Participants upload their project plan to a platform where peers score it based on clarity, feasibility, and comprehensiveness, with the platform aggregating and averaging these scores.\n\n5. **Gamified Assessments with Real-Time Scoring:**\n   - Develop gamified assessments where tasks are structured as games or challenges. These games can automatically score participants based on their performance in various scenarios. Scores can be based on factors like speed, accuracy, creativity, and adherence to game rules.\n   - Example: In a business strategy game, participants score points for making strategic decisions that increase virtual company profits, market share, or sustainability metrics.\n\nEach of these approaches offers a way to score competences with minimal human involvement, leveraging technology to automate and streamline the assessment process. This can enhance objectivity, efficiency, and scalability of the assessment system.",

      "content": "Certainly! Let's evaluate the different approaches to assessing the competencies - the self-reported method, the single factual question approach, and the five-question version.\n\n### 1. Self-Reported Method\n\n**Pros:**\n- **Personal Reflection:** Encourages introspection, allowing individuals to reflect on their experiences and behaviors.\n- **Ease of Administration:** Easy to implement and complete, especially in large groups or organizations.\n- **Subjective Insight:** Provides personal insights into an individual's perception of their abilities and experiences.\n\n**Cons:**\n- **Bias and Inaccuracy:** Prone to self-report bias. Individuals may overestimate their competencies or provide socially desirable responses.\n- **Lack of Objectivity:** Lacks external validation, making it difficult to measure actual performance or ability accurately.\n- **Limited Depth:** May not capture the full complexity or context of an individual’s competencies.\n\n### 2. Single Factual Question Approach\n\n**Pros:**\n- **Specificity:** Each question is targeted, aiming to extract specific information about a competency.\n- **Efficiency:** Quick to answer, making it suitable for assessments where time is limited.\n- **Easier to Evaluate:** Simplifies the scoring process, as each response is more straightforward to assess.\n\n**Cons:**\n- **Limited Scope:** Each question might not capture the full breadth of the competency.\n- **Context Dependence:** The response’s relevance can heavily depend on the individual's experiences or interpretation of the question.\n- **Risk of Misinterpretation:** The question might be misunderstood, leading to inaccurate responses or assessments.\n\n### 3. Five-Question Version\n\n**Pros:**\n- **Comprehensive Assessment:** Covers various aspects of a competency, providing a more thorough evaluation.\n- **Progressive Difficulty:** Ranges from basic to more complex aspects, offering insights into different levels of mastery.\n- **Flexibility:** Allows individuals to demonstrate competency in various ways, accommodating different experiences and skills.\n\n**Cons:**\n- **Time-Consuming:** More questions require more time to answer and analyze, potentially leading to respondent fatigue.\n- **Complex Scoring:** Evaluating responses can be more challenging due to the increased volume and variety of answers.\n- **Potential Redundancy:** Some questions might overlap in what they assess, leading to repetitive information.\n\nEach method has its strengths and weaknesses. The self-reported approach offers personal insights but lacks objectivity. The single factual question is efficient but might not capture the competency's full scope. The five-question version provides a comprehensive view but is more time-consuming and complex to analyze. The choice of method should align with the assessment’s goals, the available resources for administration and analysis, and the importance of depth versus efficiency in the assessment process.",

It allows for introspection and self-awareness, essential in personal development. However, it should be complemented with more objective methods in high-stakes assessments. |\n| **Single Factual Question Approach** | Targeted Question Design; Situational Examples; Case Study Use; External Data Validation; Expert Review. | Multi-source Verification; Clarification Sessions; Contextual Customization; Example Responses; Iterative Testing. | Strong in specificity, but may oversimplify complex competencies. | This method is highly efficient and effective for quick assessments where time and resources are limited. It's particularly useful in large-scale surveys or preliminary screenings. The approach, while direct and clear, may need supplementary methods for a comprehensive understanding of complex competencies. |\n| **Five-Question Version** | Progressive Complexity; Diverse Formats; Contextual Relevance; Feedback Loops; Training Integration. | Time Management; Advanced Analysis Tools; Customized Question Sets; Clear Instructions; Feedback-based Adjustment. | Comprehensive but potentially time-consuming. Excellent depth of assessment. | This approach is best suited for in-depth evaluations where detailed understanding of competencies is crucial. It’s particularly beneficial in settings where a nuanced understanding of an individual's skills and capabilities is more valuable than a superficial overview. The method's thoroughness makes it ideal for detailed competency mapping and development planning. |\n\n### Reviewer's Final Choice: Five-Question Version\n\nAfter reviewing the methods, the five-question version is chosen as the most effective approach for comprehensive competency assessment. This method provides a well-rounded evaluation by gradually increasing the complexity of questions and covering various aspects of each competency. It’s particularly beneficial in environments where a deep and nuanced understanding of skills and capabilities is essential. The inclusion of feedback mechanisms and integration with training modules adds significant value, fostering a continuous learning and development cycle. While it is time-consuming, the depth of insight it offers outweighs this limitation, making it a powerful tool for both individual and organizational development. Additionally, the use of advanced analysis tools helps manage the complexity of data interpretation, ensuring that the assessments are both thorough and manageable.",

The questions should be structured to gradually increase in complexity and depth, providing a nuanced understanding of the individual's proficiency in each area. Here are the important features these questions should contain:\n\n### 1. Basic Understanding\n\n- **Focus:** The first question should assess basic knowledge or initial exposure to the competency.\n- **Structure:** Simple, straightforward to ensure the respondent clearly understands the fundamental concept.\n\n### 2. Practical Application\n\n- **Focus:** The second question should probe the respondent's ability to apply the competency in practical situations.\n- **Structure:** Scenario-based or requiring examples of real-world application.\n\n### 3. Problem-Solving and Adaptation\n\n- **Focus:** This question should evaluate how the respondent uses the competency to solve problems or adapt to new situations.\n- **Structure:** Asking for an instance where they faced a challenge or change and how they addressed it using this competency.\n\n### 4. Integration and Innovation\n\n- **Focus:** Focus on how the respondent integrates this competency with others to innovate or create something new.\n- **Structure:** Should prompt the respondent to demonstrate how they combine this skill with other skills or knowledge in a creative or innovative way.\n\n### 5. Leadership and Influence\n\n- **Focus:** Assess the respondent's ability to lead with this competency and influence others.\n- **Structure:** Questions that explore how the respondent has mentored, guided, or influenced others using this particular skill or knowledge area.\n\nBy structuring the questions with these features, the assessment can effectively gauge not just the presence of a competency, but also its depth, adaptability, and impact on others. This approach ensures a holistic understanding of the individual’s capabilities and potential.",

Digital technologies are transforming the way we interact with each other, learn, access services, work, exert our rights as citizens, travel and have fun. To face up to these challenges and keep pace with change, people need to strengthen their capacity to challenge mainstream thinking, develop relevant skills, and transform new ideas into sustainable solutions for the common good. Being entrepreneurial enables people to act and transform ideas and opportunities into shared value. Fostering entrepreneurial learning informs citizens – as lifelong learners – how to keep up with changing environments, as they not only adapt to change, but hold their future in their hands1.\nBut what is meant by entrepreneurship?\nThe European Commission conceives entrepreneurship as a competence, therefore not only in its narrow sense related to the identification of opportunities, business development, self-employment, business creation and growth, summarised as “becoming an entrepreneur”; but especially in its broader definition connected with aspects such as personal development, creativity, proactivity and spirit of initiative, summarised as “becoming entrepreneurial”2.\nEntrepreneurship, therefore, is the capacity to act upon opportunities and ideas and transform them into value for others. The value that is created can be financial, cultural, or social. The result of acting upon opportunities and ideas is not only to generate profit, but also to improve the social and cultural conditions of the context. Developing tools to create value, then, means training people, citizens and workers capable of innovating their environments, making an effective contribution and responding to emerging needs.\nEntreptreneurship is a life competence relevant to personal development and fulfilment and finding and progressing in employment, as well as initiating new ventures ranging from community campaigns, social enterprises to new start-up businesses.\nWith the aim of informing, promoting and inspiring the development of entrepreneurial competences at all levels of education, training and in the world of work; the European Commission developed a research project in cooperation with stakeholders and experts across Europe that resulted in the EntreComp framework. The model is the result of that extensive research work that started in November 2014 and ended in 2016 with the publication of the above-mentioned framework. This publication undoubtedly did not constitute a point of arrival; but rather a starting point and a springboard to make the international debate on these issues even more lively and pave the way for numerous publications, projects, initiatives and activities that originate from it.\nThe idea, therefore, is to create a shared European framework, in which all actors involved in the development of entrepreneurial competences can recognise themselves through a common language. In this sense, it is pointed out that the acquisition of an\n1 McCallum E., Weicht R., McMullan L., Price A.,(2018) EntreComp into Action: get inspired, make it happen (M. Bacigalupo & W.

EntreComp creates a shared understanding of the knowledge, skills and attitudes that define what it means to be entrepreneurial.\nEntreComp can be used to assess individual skills, to design learning opportunities to support workforce development to design career pathways to support startups and to guide policy development\n    -4 -\n\nPocket Guide For Aspiring Entrepreneurs\nAnalysis Of Entrecomp With Its 3 Sections\nEntreComp identifies the competences that make someone entrepreneurial. These can then be used to support entrepreneurial learning in different settings – this may include civil society, companies, education, youth work, communities, start-ups and among individuals.\n  EntreComp has the potential to be used in a variety of ways including:\n• mobilise interest in entrepreneurship and inspire action;\n• create value by adapting the framework to specific contexts; • appraise and assess levels of entrepreneurship competence; • implement entrepreneurial ideas and projects;\n• recognise entrepreneurship skills.\n S\nS\n&\n&\nO O N N\nO\nO\nP\nP\nC T T I I\nP\nP\nO\nO\nA A C\nR\nRT\nTU\nU\n T T O O\nN\nN\nI\nT\nI\nI\nT\nI N\nE\nI\nS\nE\nS\nS\nC E E S\nD\nE\nE\nA\nA\nR\nU R R C\nI\nE\nE\nS\nS\nEntrecomp wheel\nO\nO\nU\nThe EntreComp wheel offers an overview of the different yet interconnected competences. These competences are designed to help you think about the entrepreneurial skills and attitudes that your work involves, they can be used as a guide when designing a new activity and/or a model for you to use or adapt for learning and assessment. At its very simplest level, EntreComp is made up of 3 competence areas: Ideas & Opportunities, Resources, and Into Action.\n- 5-\n \n Pocket Guide For Aspiring Entrepreneurs\nIdeas & opportunities is about looking for the ways you can create values for others by creating your vision, using your creativity and spotting opportunities while making sure these ideas are ethical and sustainable.\nResources is about the resources you have inside yourself, how to mobilise them while understanding your skills, strengths and capabilities as well as knowing where you can find other resources elsewhere.\nInto action is about taking the initiative, doing it and learning from experiences, while along the way understanding risks, because nothing is straightforward.\nEach area contains five competences, which, together, are the building blocks of entrepreneurship as a competence. There is no single core competence in EntreComp, and the competences are of equal importance.\nBeneath each of the 15 competences are a number of different threads that describe what the particular competence really means in practical terms. These threads are the building blocks of each competence. Each thread has associated learning outcomes across eight-level progression levels, from foundation to intermediate, advanced and expert levels. This sense of progression is important when considering the development of a learner over time, the different starting points of learners or exploring to create a coherent entrepreneurship education pathway. In addition, it provides a comprehensive list of 442 learning outcomes, which offers inspiration and insight for those designing interventions from different educational contexts and domains of application.\n3 competence areas\n60 threads\n442 learning out- comes\n8 progression levels\n       15 competences\n    Mapping different goals against\nthe elementts of EntreComp\n    I WANT TO MOBILISE\nI WANT TO CREATE VALUE\n  I WANT TO APPRAISE & ASSESS\nI WANT TO IMPLEMENT\n  Mapping different goals against the elements of EntreComp\n- 6-\nI WANT TO RECOGNISE\n\nPocket Guide For Aspiring Entrepreneurs\nWho Needs The Guide?\nThis Pocket Guide represents a further step in informing, promoting and inspiring the development of entrepreneurial learning based on EntreComp. It targets primarily young entrepreneurs, within or outside existing ventures.\n The advantages of using EntreComp for young entrepreneurs are:\n• Understand how existing activities contribute to entrepreneurial competences • Help entrepreneurs map their own entrepreneurial competences\n• Design new training to support business creation or business growth mapped to EntreComp competences\nEmbracing EntreComp, therefore, means believing that everyone can learn to become more entrepreneurial. It also means believing that – by becoming more entrepreneurial – learners, employees, civil servants, managers, third sector leaders or business owners can create greater value for others. It means believing that entrepreneurship is not only about creating successful businesses, rather it is a competence that allows us to improve the environment we live in, by tackling old and new problems, addressing unmet needs and having the ambition to tackle well-known and emerging challenges3.\nThe aim of the Pocket Guide is to present free online resources examples to support young entrepreneurs, who want to strengthen their entrepreneurial competences, to develop their ideas into actions and to nurture the capacity to manage innovative projects. By presenting 15 resources (open book, a free online course, video, articles, blog), one for each competence of the framework, this publication shares a number of inputs to reflect on entrepreneurial competences and how to enhance them.\nThe pocket guide is not a process guide; it rather provides young entrepreneurs with a selection of orientation resources and tools for them to experiment and create their own map to entrepreneurial learning. Readers should think about which competences they would like to deepen or increase and can go through the selected resources.\nThe list of resources is not exhaustive or comprehensive, but offers the readers a range of alternative approaches to explore, combine and experiment.\n 3 Bacigalupo, M., Kampylis, P., Punie, Y., Van den Brande, G.

Luxembourg: Publication Office of the European Union; EUR 27939 EN; doi:10.2791/593884\n- 7-\n \n Pocket Guide For Aspiring Entrepreneurs\nErasmus for Young Entrepreneurs is a cross-border exchange programme which gives new or aspiring entrepreneurs the chance to learn from experienced entrepreneurs running small businesses in other\nParticipating Countries.\nThe exchange of experience takes place during a stay with the experienced entrepreneur, which helps you, as a new entrepreneur acquire the skills needed to run a small firm. You benefit from fresh perspectives on your business and gets the opportunities to cooperate with foreign partners or learn about new markets.\nAs a new entrepreneur, you benefit from on-the-job training in a small or medium- sized enterprise in another Participating Country. This eases the successful start of your business or strengthens your new enterprise. You can also benefit from access to new markets, international cooperation and potential possibilities for collaboration with business partners abroad.\nAs a host entrepreneur, you can benefit from fresh ideas from a motivated new entrepreneur in your business. The entrepreneurs can have skills or knowledge in an area you do not master, which could also complement yours. Most host entrepreneurs enjoyed the experience so much that they decided to host other new entrepreneurs afterwards.\nIn the longer-term, you will benefit from wide networking opportunities, and, possibly, decide to continue your collaboration, possibly as long-term business partners (e.g. joint ventures, sub-contracting activities, contractor-supplier relationships, etc).\n“Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs” is financed by the European Commission and operates across the Participating Countries with the help of the local contact points, competent in business support (e.g. Chambers of Commerce, start-up centres, incubators etc.). Their activities are coordinated at European level by the Support Office of the Programme (% Eurochambres)..\nApplication and participation in the programme are free of charge. No application or participation fees must be requested by any organisation.\nWho can participate?\n- New entrepreneurs, firmly planning to set up their own business or have already started one within the last three years\n- Experienced entrepreneurs who own or manage a Small or Medium-Sized Enterprise in one of the Participating Countries\nErasmus for Young Entrepreneurs helps provide aspiring entrepreneurs with the skills necessary to start and/or successfully run a small business in Europe. New entrepreneurs gather and exchange knowledge and business ideas with an experienced entrepreneur,\n-8 -\n\n Pocket Guide For Aspiring Entrepreneurs\nwith whom they stay and collaborate for a period of 1 to 6 months (the New Entrepreneur’s stay is partially financed by the European Commission). The stay (for only New Entrepreneurs) is partly financed by the European Commission.\nDuring the exchange with Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme, the parallel pilot project LoopMe will guide and accompany you to improve your 15 key entrepreneurial skills.\nThe goal of LoopMe is to lead and follow learning and development.\nWith more than 20.000+ users across Europe, members are trusting LoopMe to support action-taking, individual reflection, and structured impact analysis.

By producing a common definition of what entrepreneurship as a competence is, EntreComp could be taken as a reference de facto by any initiative which aims to foster entrepreneurial learning and to stimulate interest in the entrepreneurial culture. In the particular case of this guide, EntreComp could inspire young entrepreneurs in mapping their competences and assess their level of competence. Starting from this, EntreComp and this pocket guide could be helpful to define a clear strategy to boost competences and to engage in entrepreneurial experiences. According to this, young entrepreneurs interested in working with this framework should follow some simple steps:\n • To choose a competence that they want to improve, taking into account the table of entrepreneurial competence mastery levels. From level 1 - BASIC to level 8 - EXPERT there are some parameters to measure progress which could suggested:\n• autonomy;\n• effective and sustainable thinking;\n• ability to move from theory to practice.\n• To analyse the thematic priorities of each competence and choose which ones are most useful for their training/coaching or mentoring course\n• To find existing content, such as the Open Educational Resources available for free online presented in this guide.\nFinally, young entrepreneurs interested in deepen more the topic of the development of the entrepreneurial competences and in being part of a broad community of people with same interests can join the EntreComp Community. The EntreComp Community is an entrepreneurial learning platform, think of it as your one-stop-shop for entrepreneurial education, entrepreneurial competences, the EntreComp framework and more. The EntreComp Community was created and developed by a team of dedicated individuals looking to bring together various European projects working in entrepreneurship.\nFind out more at: https://entrecomp.com/about/\n- 26 -\n \nPocket Guide For Aspiring Entrepreneurs\nBibliography\n• Bacigalupo, M., Kampylis, P., Punie, Y., Van den Brande, G.
