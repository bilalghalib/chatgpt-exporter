What is he really trying to say here? Can you help me? I want to connect. I think reading this with a different lens, real translation, doesn't have to be word for word, maybe even like get the gist of it, the feeling of it, and then the translation of it would be good.",

      "content": "Got it — thank you for sharing this, Bilal. I can see why the auto-translation felt clunky. Your grandfather’s post is actually weaving something quite beautiful: he’s connecting a Qur’anic verse about the primordial testimony of humanity (when God made all descendants of Adam bear witness to His Lordship) with modern scientific ideas about the genome, DNA, and the immense knowledge contained within each human being.  \n\nHere’s a layered rendering for you — first the **gist/feeling**, then a **closer translation**:\n\n---\n\n### 🌿 The Gist / Feeling\nYour grandfather is reflecting on a Qur’anic verse where all human beings testified to God before birth. He’s saying this “testimony” is not just a spiritual metaphor, but it’s also reflected in our very biology — in the genome and in every cell. Just as the Qur’an describes that nothing escapes God’s knowledge, modern science shows us the astonishing complexity and information carried within DNA, holding our health, traits, and even potential diseases. He’s amazed that Western scientists boast about these discoveries, while the Qur’an already pointed to the truth of this testimony. He laments that many Muslims read the Qur’an without realizing its depth, and they miss this profound connection between revelation and creation.\n\n---\n\n### 📖 A More Faithful Translation\n> *“And when your Lord took from the children of Adam — from their loins — their descendants, and made them testify against themselves: ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said: ‘Yes, we bear witness’—lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, ‘We were unaware of this.’”* (Qur’an 7:172)\n\nYour grandfather explains:\n- **“Witness them on themselves”**: God describes the act of testimony — every human bore witness to Him.  \n- This is like the **divine human genome**: each person is born with their entire story written inside their cells, encoded in their genes, carrying the traces of their existence.  \n- Every newborn comes already carrying this “written record.”  \n- Scientists today marvel at the genome: billions of chemical letters in the nucleus of each cell, containing endless information about life, health, and disease — a kind of living library.  \n- But this was already indicated in the Qur’an.  \n- Sadly, many read the Qur’an without pondering, so they don’t see how it aligns with discoveries that astonish Western scientists.  \n- The genome is not a creation of humans — it is the creation of Allah, and this testimony written within us is from Him.  \n\n---\n\n✨ So in short, he’s saying: **the Qur’anic concept of the primordial testimony (“Am I not your Lord?”) is mirrored in the biological testimony of our DNA, which holds our story within us.** Science is only now uncovering what was already indicated in revelation.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to write this up in a way you could actually comment back to him on Facebook — like a warm, short message that shows you understood and appreciate his reflection?",
