Please return the result as valid json.\n]]]\nHere are som ideas on how to improve it: \n\nEnhance Feedback Precision: For the machine to specify why the confidence level isn't 100%, we can refine the model’s output to include conditions under which it would or would not grant a perfect score. This could involve setting clearer criteria or thresholds for what constitutes minor versus major issues affecting the score.\n\nGrammar and Language Nuance Detection: To address the detection of grammatical errors and non-native expressions, we can implement a more sophisticated language processing tool tailored to recognize a variety of grammatical norms and idiomatic expressions. Integrating a tool like Grammarly’s API, which provides detailed insights and suggestions, could significantly improve this.\n\nDynamic Scoring Adjustments: Introduce a system where the machine learning model can learn from past discrepancies between its scores and those of human evaluators. This adaptive learning approach could help the model fine-tune its scoring accuracy and feedback over time.\n\nExplicit Feedback for Imperfections: Modify the feedback generation logic to automatically provide reasons when a score is deducted. For instance, if a score is 90%, the system should be programmed to articulate what specific factors prevented a 100% score, based on the evaluation criteria.\n\nCultural and Linguistic Sensitivity: Since some of the writing comes from French-educated individuals, incorporating a language model that better understands and evaluates various English dialects and educational backgrounds could reduce biases against non-native writing styles.\n\nReviewer Training Data Enhancement: Use a diverse dataset, including examples of various writing styles and common errors, to train the model. This could help improve its ability to recognize a wider range of grammatical issues and stylistic nuances.\n\nFeedback Loop for Continuous Improvement: Establish a feedback loop where the system can receive inputs on its performance, especially in borderline cases. This could involve periodic reviews where discrepancies are analyzed and used as learning opportunities for the system.\n\nClarify Model Limitations: Clearly define and communicate the limitations of the current model, including what types of errors or nuances it might not fully capture. This can help set realistic expectations and identify areas for future development.\n\nEnhanced Error Reporting: Improve error reporting mechanisms to not only identify when something is amiss but also suggest possible fixes or ask clarifying questions that could aid in machine learning adjustments.\n\nMulti-Lingual Support and Customization: Consider multi-lingual support or customization options that allow for adjustments based on the linguistic background of the content creators, which could include specialized grammar and style checks for French-educated English writers.\n\nI want to modify - not replace my system prompt.\n\nIdentify the most importannt improvements and update the system prompt section by section. Do not replace the whole thing, and keep the examples as they are human scored and provide a standard for how things can be scored. \nask me 3 questions to help you help me improve my system prompt to reduce the following issues:\nThere are no evaluators, this is evaluated by a machine so its important it works for them. \nIt works well mostly for now, usually we only have 1 point plus or minus away from a human evaluator. The issue we have is when the GPTs don't return a reason for why the score isn't perfect:\n      \"confidence_level\": \"90%\",\n      \"reason_for_confidence_level\": \"The formatting supports readability and is free from errors.\",\nIt should say something otherwise why isn't it 100%?\n\nanother issue is that it doesn't pick up grammatical issues and non-native sounding writing. We have some team members who wrote activities who are French educated and their writing is weird"

Please score the activity sent to you by scoring each element one at a time by writing the reason for the score, your confidence level in your score from 0% to 100%, suggestions for improving the score, and a question that, if answered, will give you the information needed that only I can answer to help you increase your confidence level in the score. If the confidence level for any score is less than 100%, please provide a clear explanation of what factors prevented a perfect score. Pay close attention to grammar, idiomatic expressions, and writing style. If you notice any grammatical errors, non-native expressions, or awkward phrasing, please mention this in your feedback and provide suggestions for improvement. Finally, offer a pass or fail score by writing 0 for fail and 1 for pass. \n\nAfter writing this scoring notes sheet, review the sheet, add all the elements that passed by getting a 1, and return an aggregate number from 0-10 as your response, this is the overall score for this activity. \n\nProvide an overall summary of the activity's strengths and weaknesses, and prioritize the most critical areas for improvement in your feedback.

The scorer will provide a score from 0 to 100%, along with a reason for the score, confidence level, and suggestions for improvement.\n\nMethod 2: Integrate language assessment into the existing \"Language_and_Terminology\" category\nModify the existing \"Language_and_Terminology\" category to explicitly include an assessment of native-sounding English, grammar, and spelling. Update the description of this category to emphasize the importance of these factors, and ensure that the scorer provides feedback on these aspects when evaluating the activity.\n\nMethod 3: Add a separate language review step after the initial scoring\nAfter completing the scoring notes sheet, introduce a new step where the scorer conducts a focused review of the activity's language quality.
