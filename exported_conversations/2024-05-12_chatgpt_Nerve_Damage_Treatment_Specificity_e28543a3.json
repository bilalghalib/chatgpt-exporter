      "content": "Refining your question for a literature review is an excellent step to ensure you gather focused and relevant information. Here are three questions that could help you specify your research question:\n\n1. **What specific aspects of nerve damage are you interested in exploring?** For example, are you interested in measuring improvements in nerve conductivity, reductions in symptoms (like pain or numbness), or enhancements in motor function? Specifying what \"helps reverse the nerve damage\" means in practical terms will narrow your focus.\n\n2. **Are there particular stages or types of multiple sclerosis or other degenerative diseases you want to focus on?** Different stages (e.g., relapsing-remitting MS vs. progressive MS) or types of degenerative diseases (like ALS, Parkinson’s disease, etc.) may respond differently to treatments like massage, myofascial release, and nerve flossing.\n\n3. **What outcome measures are you most interested in?** Are you looking for clinical outcomes (like electromyography changes), patient-reported outcomes (like quality of life or symptom relief), or both? Identifying the type of outcomes you're interested in will help you find studies that are aligned with your research goals.\n\nBy answering these questions, you can refine your literature review question to be more targeted and effective in finding the appropriate papers.",
