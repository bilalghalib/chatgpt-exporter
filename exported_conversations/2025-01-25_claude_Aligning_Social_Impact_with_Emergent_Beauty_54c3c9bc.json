            "extracted_content": "I’m writing to show you why I believe our systems emerge from our foundational beliefs and mindsets—about what the world is and what humans are. Like a dog that won't cross an electric fence, we are limited by our deepest assumptions, many of which are historically ingrained. The problem is that we have lost a way of relating to the world that honors quality and meaning over mere materiality, and I want to show you why reconnecting with that sense of depth helps us truly come alive. By coming alive and reconnecting with this lost way of seeing, we can build new kinds of systems that honor people as ends in themselves, not just means for achieving “impact,” “funding,” or “goals.”\nBelow, I’m going to walk you through:\nWhy emergent approaches matter more than rigid systems\nWhy our present mindset of “winners take all” and mastery is flawed\nHow honoring relationships, depth, and meaning (vs. breadth and metrics) can heal burnout\nWhy I think we can form a better foundation for Bloom.pm by coming alive first, then building systems\nI’ll share the personal reflections, doubts, and inspirations that led me here. Then, I’ll remind you, in the end, what I told you.\n\nTell Them\nCore Hypothesis: Systems Emerge From Our Foundational Beliefs\nThe suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the master's house with the master's tools are becoming clearer and clearer to me. I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people as ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. It's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror. Honor and dignity are worth more than continued funding from donors who don't trust us to treat us well.\nI am convinced that we need emergent approaches—good people and trust that they will do beautiful things—not good systems we attempt to shape people through. We are kind of limited by our foundational beliefs and understandings. Historically, these beliefs have led us to live in a way that is instrumental and transactional. We lost a different way we once had of seeing the world—one related to quality, to a sense of meaning, not just materiality.\n\nWhy Emergent Approaches Over Rigid Systems?\nEven the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care and our connection are essential. We need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful—a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. There's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage instead of leaning into the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality. We need to see them with the eye of quality—the eye of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty—the eye that knows these things.\n\nCritique of the “Winners Take All” Mindset\nDeveloping skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something. What if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and access what their hearts are calling them towards?\nWhat if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out, rather than pushing funding, expenditures, and movement that may be adding friction and doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone? With so much friction, we can certainly burn people out, as we've seen on our own teams. What are we really doing?\n\nRelationships, Depth, and Healing Burnout\nThen, we can have scalable systems where those people can impact others, rather than thinking about scale in breadth—showing how many people have jobs or planted trees. We need to get more comfortable with depth: how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude, making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change versus one which has \"good impact.\" Impact—the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor or an asteroid on the earth—reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days; things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing.\nWhy do we talk about wellbeing and stress? What if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, and built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community? We can move fast later when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, and I know you worry about the business failing, and that's okay. I sort of think that business might need to go.\n\nFoundational Beliefs and Historical Context\nI don't know if you believe, as I do, that good things live and true things find their homes. If we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and truly focus on the problem that moves us and what brings us to life sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood,\" I think we'll find something. It might be small—who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while—although I don't think that's so bad.\nWhat if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\"? Perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things—perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what I've been doing.\n\nPersonal Reflections: Coming Alive\nI've been thinking about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. The ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most effective\"—it's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate. Initially, I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things—that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance.\nExternally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley, and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me. If you think about it, you will use your will to compel your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal. Your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, and why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors who believe that the ends justify the means?\n\nRelationality, Love, and Meaning as Ends\nIt's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when I was younger, inspired by Father Greg Boyle. When they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, and care—these are all ends, reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not perceived by the eye of rationality. They are perceived by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, and what beauty is. That eye is the one that I would like to cultivate.\nThe Nietzsche quote, \"He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how,\" guides me here. People who love have climbed mountains—\"there ain't no mountain high enough,\" \"there ain't no ocean vast enough\"—to keep them away from the beauty they want to do. This is a real reason, a source of persistence, vitality, and passion to knock on a thousand doors until one opens. This is why they'll leave our heart-based aliveness-focused program and join Y Combinator to get what they need financially or figure something totally new and unexpected out.\nI'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, the upside-down pyramid, starting with why, character strengths, and coming alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness-based stress reduction for people to better manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. It's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct? What about that is meaningful for us that's being lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echoes within you. Those emotions are treasures, and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra.\n\nEmotions as Messengers of Meaning\nEach tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist, and sink into what we're doing without being attached. Contentedness is not an emotion; it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing things and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small, bold actions. Similar to the zone described by the flow state, where our skills are at the edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at, we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of calls.\n\nWhere the Current System Falls Short\nThis means trust, implies process, and moves people, businesses, projects, and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive, organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future, and planned. It's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise. It's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). We saw how let down the people who can see this hypocrisy felt. It's so true though—the goals, the SDGs, the plans—these things are dead on arrival. The reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on the attainment of something.\nI know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact, I'm confident that since you've known me long enough, you might accept it a bit more. Yet for me, it took a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with Aristotle and the idea of classification. Aristotle’s metaphysics focus on cause-and-effect relationships (final cause, material cause) percolate like water through the grounds of Western culture and get amplified by the mechanistic thinking of the Scientific Revolution (Descartes, Newton). It's just a brain watching a world of parts interact—sort of system thinking, Hobbes. Oh crap, Christians are killing each other; we're totally horrible, and we need a rational government to put things in order. Systems should be what we follow, not people. Enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, laden with democratic American ideas like \"let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion,\" etc.\n\nHistorical Roots and a Lost Way of Seeing\nWe live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause-effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that Galileo said is the perfect way to describe the world. It can all be displayed as a nice little infographic—the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of consciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria, and we go fix that because death is bad. What about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear-based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about or understand the impact of the history of ideas) had?\nWe're here because of someone else's war, freaking people out. Our systems destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans. If there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to achieve goals more efficiently, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes? Who cares if we breed them to be transported across the ocean and have no idea what that does to the flavor, let alone nutritional profile?\n\nIt’s About Our Way of Seeing, Not Just Different Goals\nWe must use these fear-based epistemologies and ontologies that see the world full of nasty, brutish people who will die shortly unless we use our reason to align with the reason of the natural world, to break it up into little pieces and use it to our favor. And BTW, the people who think like this are more likely to be skiing in the Alps and owning businesses than running them. Also, their kids don't go to public schools and get graded like screws and meat of varying quality. By the way, I'm more of a B/B+ sort of person than a Grade A, so here, doing this thinking is a bit out of my weight class. Yet I digress, and I try anyway to help you see, feel, and understand this foundational thing.\nIt's NOT about the wrong goals, profit or SDGs. It's not even about the systems leveraging personal and professional growth to help transform the economic system into one that's better for people and the planet. No, it's about the way of seeing and understanding what a person is, what the world is, and the systems that emerge from that understanding.\n\nReconnecting With Meaning for New Systems to Emerge\nOur neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is hard to argue with. Market efficiency sort of works, as does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core. We can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy, resources, and food—all commodities—which the markets manage, valuing perfectly well. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy-sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short-sighted efficiency of materiality.\nI've tried not to say God in this run-on paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of Instagram, a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country—little pinballs bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love? That's some oxytocin and some serotonin floating around a bloodstream in a body that wants to keep its bodily integrity intact so that it can propagate itself and not die. You cannot learn Darwin's theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty—don't you know? There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this; you may have even felt this if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost.\nThese things have been bugging me for a long time. I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children—full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post-WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it at our own expense. Sure, this is all fine, said typing on a MacBook Pro made by a capitalist company with $216 billion in cash reserves, benefiting from the international trade that brings me coffee from Ethiopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe.\nYet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness are and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that—a little each day. Weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet somehow I think that goes against my point here. We need to see each other, even our messy selves. This is from my heart to yours. I'm writing this with you, Dara, and you, Munir, in mind.\nIt's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey—where I've felt off, yet I acquiesced, allowing my doubt in my own feelings to fester. I thought maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do—the upside-down pyramid, self-efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, one-on-ones, the 1% better journey were about that. Goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, but they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon; become a runner. We've talked about these.\nYet more foundationally, this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on: we should measure at the end of the day and attend to our sources of meaning at the start. The story of self and the story of the world can and must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to see, echo, resonate with, and inspire knowledge and action. Togetherness matters, being a mirror matters, finding emotions is precious, discerning between emotions and states matters, goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice. We can go slow, be gentle with ourselves, and be successful once we start on the path to self-knowledge and alignment with values, perception, and enaction.\nI think sometimes you must think that I'm crazy, and perhaps I am. Although I'm working on developing my ideas, gathering stories (microfinance was beautiful, right? Amu Yunus got a Nobel Prize, cool? Well, we're seeing the fruits of not foundationally changing the perception of what finance is, what money is, what it serves. What a human is with a spate of suicides as a result of not being able to pay the petty sum back and being hounded by people who are achieving \"targets\"—targets, pretty grim).\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no, it's not only because we don't have money for paid holidays; there's something burning about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions—we must treat people as ends and get close. Relationships matter, commitment matters, connection matters. Scale can happen in a beautiful and authentic way, probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again.\nI sometimes think perhaps I've been saved from success because I'm not sure I would have had the time, perspective, and frustration, quite frankly, to see as I do. Am I just \"sourgraping\" this whole thing? I don't think so. I think indigenous economics—talking about cyclical time (not linear) thinking, seven generations (not retiring when I'm 40), relationships with a world of meaning (not humans and nature as resources to extract)—are similar. Yet indigenous economics stays small and sort of implies we must take their principles and ways of doing things rather than discovering them ourselves in our own indigeneity—our Lebanese indigenous economics—emerging from systems built by people who have reintegrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic and the eyes of meaning and quality. Being confident enough to know we need to be wary of too much planning in an era of collapse. We need to live in a way that when the bombs drop or the seas start rising, we are confident we did what we were made to do and were successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not.\n\nRemind Them of What We Told Them\nSo there you have it. I’ve told you about:\nHow our systems emerge from deep-seated beliefs and mindsets\nWhy emergent approaches and depth of relationship matter more than quick, scalable fixes\nHow transactional and instrumental thinking leads to burnout, while real connection can heal and help us come alive\nWhy the historical context of our beliefs has stripped us of a sense of meaning and how reconnecting with that meaning might guide us forward\nI hope this short essay made some sense. I wanted to share this to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic. I think this is what I want to do next for work: to operationalize this process of first recognizing the perceptual faculty that we're being gaslit not to identify (artists usually are pretty clear about this, good ones at least). That faculty can see things and know things that are both reliable and true—just as reason can see and we can deduce truth, we can do that with quality as well.\nBy finding that and living it more in our lives, we come alive, and by coming alive we bring energy and goodness, building capacity, skills, relationships, knowledge, stories of self, stories of world—essentially forging a new foundation for new systems to emerge. We all need to awaken the artist within us to help us weave a more beautiful story that is just as true, and perhaps more true, to undo the fragility of systems and unearth the beauty and humility of emergence.\nI don't think I intend to \"get by\" anymore with my work. I have to share what I know, or I shrivel up and help no one. I remember being asked in 2016 to make an entrepreneurship program, and I thought it was silly to have everyone do the same assignments. I thought it would be cool to direct people to the things they needed with technology. Today, I'm going back again and having another one of those moments where I can't do the same thing anymore. I need to do something different, something beautiful, and I'd love to do it with you—if you're in with me :)\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]\n"

            "extracted_content": "Okay, so we're going to be writing an essay with our voice because one of my skills and competencies and something that I pride myself in is my ability to follow a thread clearly and coherently and articulated, and this content must be mine and come from my heart and not be external and also it must be connected to all realities. It's my intention that this becomes a snapshot of my thinking about the truths that I've discovered in my life and the realities they imply towards a good life and how that impacts the sense of speed, rush, fear, otherness, alienation, and impending disaster with the climate, the wars the mistrust of our neighbors and the lack of time and space and knowledge of what to do with ourselves. I'm indebted to my mom who shared with me in October of 2011 their aid prayer from Mecca, and in that prayer there was a talk and in that talk the speaker, shared the idea that God is beautiful, and he loves that which is beautiful and in that time, I was very hurt and unable to accept all of the tradition that I had been raised with because it was getting in the way of me trusting my heart, and that tension the reality that this person I respected and admired was some one that my heart honestly could lean towards and brought me aliveness was fighting with the textual reality of the lack of an articulated Islam or Christianity that I could check some box in an accounting system with the god and with my family to say that this woman is a Muslim and therefore I am allowed to have these feelings. rather than the fear, hope, trepidation, openness, wonder anticipation heart opening heart racing, mind spinning possibility, of accepting love.  I remember laying down on the ground outside and she asked me, do you love me? and rather than taking a moment to take a deep breath to look inside of my heart, and to say the truth of what I found, I deflected. I asked for literalism.  I asked how do you define love? There are places within us that know love that can distinguish love from lust and in my confusion and desire to be confused to avoid the pain and the stress and the fear of confronting my family and confronting the check box guard and religion that I had invented that wasn't the true way of interpreting are the only way I deflected and created confusion in my life and compounded that confusion for years and years I allowed myself in that confusion to create a shadow and to have the part of me that was alive to live in that shadow. I nook out of the house in the dark to be able to be with the parts of me that were actually alive and I lived like a zombie, having not slept and like a zombie because in the day I was living waiting for the night distant from my heart, distant from the thing that knows the truths of the world and the truths within myself. and in October 2011 I was given one of the keys of a trifecta that allowed me to open my heart and to connect reintegrate with my emotions, with my feelings, with my perception of beauty, with my sense of meaning and sense of self, and ultimately, at long last, the realizations that beauty is the splendor of truth. and beauty is that which draws you into love, and that the perception and recognition of beauty is a part of a faculty that is inextricable from that perception and that reality.  This faculty within us that sees beauty is the place where we can answer the questions of what is true and the confusions that we might have about what is actually good How should we live? What is real? My background as someone who loves science and technology and philosophy and rationalizations.  I think connects to this desire for control and this lack of engaging with the fear and the reality of the bird that when it wakes up and opens its eyes and sees its hungry children, and leaves its nest in fear and hope, seeking the worms, the seeds, the sustenance and the awe in the wonder and the gratitude and the aliveness at finding it. This way of seeing the world and living in the world requires both eyes, we do have a rational faculty We can think ahead to plant seeds now to organize our land, to let land rest after understanding soil depletion so that we can have a better harvest next year and I've realized that this love of planning and stability along with my rejection of the tradition that was brought to me that was teaching me how to open the eye of the heart. limited me from being able to explore in an open way, and the only way that's real on the tight rope of life to keep my eyes focused on beauty and to walk without looking down knowing and not knowing that the next step is going to land and that will be okay and that will make it. because the rope is invisible to the tight rope walker. It's just sensed, just like the worm is invisible to the bird. and in the muslin tradition were given many promises of what happens to those who trust and have god consciousness that these are those that are successful.  And these beliefs I think must be taken gradually, step by step. You take one step, that proves the rope is there, you leave one morning, you find the worms, but winter comes, things change, the wind blows, and the rope moves ever so slightly. and so I believe that it's not that we must avoid planning planting the seeds and using our mind, but that we need as a society to traverse this canyon. We are in a place where our stasis is destructive, our not changing is damaging, and I believe the roots of why staying the same is damaging is connected to the roots that have alienated us from this perception of beauty and truth and goodness, and even trusting that this means something that it's not an emotion only that it may have states ways that are uplifting inspire us.  You watch a movie about Nelson Mandela and you leave uplifted the sense of possibility and hope and maybe you think to yourself, how can I be a little more like that? And so the first thing that happened to me after my partner broke up with me because I could not face the fear. of the reality that was being that was beckoning the reality of I love this person and I don't know what to do. I'm young I don't know my faith.  I don't know myself. I don't know what love actually means. that love is the splendor of truth and that beauty and truth and love come together and that if I wanted to know God and how to live I have to read all three books the book of revelation, the book of inner insight and looking within our feelings, our thoughts, even our negative ruminations, and the book of the outer world the beauty of a river flowing down a mountain and a waterfall, and fish below in a clear pond eating the bugs on the river and then if you follow that river as it passes through human civilization on the other side, you look again into the water, and you find ugliness, a weird slimy color, a film on the top of the water potentially dead fish, a bad smell it repulses you. and why is that the case? How is this also true and how is that assign?  These signs of repulsion could have prevented us from continuing down this path the they would say the smell of London in the 1800s the squalor the tight neighborhoods with sewage flowing down the middle and Jack the Ripper and the pollution bellowing into the air and kids coming home in the morning after working at night shift in a factory and injuries and I'm sure people knew this wasn't beautiful. yet it helped increase the sense of control because there was a a power to it that could be grown resources accumulating into the hands of the owners allowing more allocating according to their desires and whims, unchecked and unpurified and unhe held up against the example of beauty and this alienation from the things that make life meaningful, require us to fill it with a hope that the future will be better. I don't feel so good right now, but I believe in this progress that we're making, this idea of progress links in deeply with this idea of how the reward system within us works. our sense of accomplishments and reward and the molecule dopamine that symbolizes it is not from achievement. It's not from making a goal and accomplishing it.  The reward comes from the expectation of a good, and so as long as we were able to tell ourselves in each other, this world might not be good to day, but to morrow it will be better when technology improves when we're able to extract more from less when we have to work less, this claim that, you know, we increase productivity and somehow work less and enjoy more is not what has happened at all. We've increased productivity and working hours, and at the same time we're reducing wages. This confusion about what is good, what do we want from life, this sense of mastery has been possible for only 200300 years and it was made possible from the primary disconnect from people with some their core faculty that is able to see and then the practice of implementing the seeing of beauty into a cycle of life that shows that you can take another step on that tight rope towards a more beautiful future and instead we went into a command and control into a cycle of allowing the things that think a we are able to control our situation and preserve our station and expand our domination and to manage people and the planet and the colonies and to do all of this in a way where we start having the science of productivity and the science of the polity and political science and we have this illusion of being able to get what we want without ever opening the eyes within us that can know what we actually want, and with only one eye, we can only see what we think we want, our needs, our fears, our expectations, and we try to address those, but it's it's a bottomless pit because the only thing that can really fill those is the eye that is able to see our true desires for love, beauty, connection, and the things that are truly satisfying.  And so what happens as we fall into lust or we fall into gluttony, or we fall into laziness, and we build escalators, and then when our bodies start falling apart, we go to the gym. And so understanding that dohamine is this reward molecule, I think is really important to see why we always imagine heaven as to morrow and that promise that things will be better, I think, kept people in a cage of anticipation and patience. of gritting our teeth kind of patience, but then, as we see in to day's world, we see that our uncontrolled, desire for control has expanded our unbeautiful ways of being into manipulating more of the world into ugliness into factories that fall on the people working to make our clothes and into promoting consumption just to be able to maintain the systems into this problematic situation that we find ourselves in that I think really is exemplified by this disconnect between this faculty that knows what is actually good and beautiful rather than the faculty that sees and wants for oneself, it's the faculty that sees and in that seeing can be satisfied in the connection and relating and and then we can talk very plainly about the rise of suicide. uh being one of the leading causes of death for young people, the beginning of suicides in preteens, which is unthinkable and it is kind of vague sense of anxiety they say that in the last 30 years the levels of anxiety have skyrocketed around the world, and we're coming to a place where I think we have to open that other eye. And I think so many people know this and part of the taste of it was during the pandemic when people uh were unable to go to the work that they were distracted by they started making sour dough, right?  connecting to the arts and to the crafts and to sharing, like you don't make a whole loaf of sourdough and eat it by yourself, and you don't even make the sourdough by yourself, you make it in collaboration with the yeast, and you wait and there's this recognition of a beauty in working with systems, working within and for systems, and they might think of it as a silly example, but as more people looked into their own lives and asked like, I'm at home and I'm with myself. What what should we do? You know people read books.  Maybe for the first time in a long time. and began to touch the parts of themselves that, you know, like when you really immersed in a book, you have a sense of it. It's not the facts of the text and the page that you're reading adding up to a narrative that you have in your mind and some kind of system of social relations that maps on to how you connect with faces and people and no, there's like there there there is a way we need to point at this reality that there's parts of us that know that I believe have been gas lit and undermined and doubted because it's not convenient. just like I couldn't say I love you to a person I loved because it would damage my relationship with my family, my self identity as a Muslim who didn't really know his religion or tradition. I think we all are unable to realize that it's way better to be that bird than to go out until eat the worm in awe and in wonder and defeat our family and to love, and to be alive, then to have complete and utter control, you know, Elon Musk and some of these transhumanists are trying to plug computers into our brains and give us, you know, cognitive capacities that far surpass what we're able to and we have to go to Mars and colonize because we want to preserve consciousness.  And these may not be the worst ideas, but we have to ask like, what's the Tological conclusion, you know? this idea of ad Astura to the stars, right, is highly motivating for many thoughtful, philosophical, wealthy, intelligent, computer science majors who have went into silicon Valley and made money somehow, like this idea of the beauty and discovery, although the beauty of nature and looking at the heavens is also connected to this realization of the grandeur of it that felt sense of oh my God, this is incredible and I get to be here and witness and the humility of seeing signs everywhere, you know, verses the kind of logical conclusion we get from how people are trying to cure death. and live forever, leading to this realization that if they had their way, what would be better then dividing the entire universe into matter that will produce energy for the conscious machines and machines that experience the ultimate pleasure constantly, you know, in the world of the effective altruists, they are talking about these things. They're talking about like, is this the most beautiful future we can imagine, which is ultra hedonistic consciousness that has colonized the entire universe and and then what, right?  and the idea of what is beautiful in every moment has infinite faces and your response in every moment can respond in a beautiful way of of infinite path gives you the infinity that we seek and the participation in a chorus and a choir in the moment right now. and sure we might have to protect ourselves if an asteroid is coming and gonna wipe out humanity, having Mars be a planet for us could be an interesting thing as an ultimate backup, but if you look at it, you know wires doesn't have a magnetic field, it would have to have a colony that is encapsulated and food grown in greenhouses and importing much from the earth. And sure it may be over time generations and generations or talking thousands of years since we live forever, it can become a habitable planet through our innovation and our our work, but I also think there is something important about knowing what the right thing to do is and the dangers. Those dangers, the vast majority of the existential dangers that Elon Musk is talking about are because we can't live together in peace on earth, and that comes about because of this lack of recognition, of a foundational faculty and perception that knows the whole that has access to seeing the end state of the entire complex system that they're trying to model and can inform us what is a beautiful way of being through residence, through self-reflection, through self understanding, and this perception directs our attention.  We can think of it like we're wr rung like a bell, and then we can hear what color or what sound we are, right? We don't know that we're a bell in the key of c or that we're a marimba and the key of sea or something. but that perception that we have that is connected to all people's perceptions of beauty and our perception of beauty and truth and love and goodness, that thing is able to inform our actions with humility rather than arrogance. All of our complex systems are false.  They measure tiny fraction of the reality, but we have access to the thing that tells us the now good thing if we can remove some of our biases and our pensions for self preservation, and if we do these things, we don't need to go to Mars. immediately sure our son will explode so we have to have options and sure that knowledge of what the universe is like will continue to evolve and, you know, the asteroid might be coming and I hope we detect it. I don't want to have this moment of looking up and feeling like I didn't live, you know, and if we look up and we're on the process of building our Mars colony, but the rockets haven't launched yet. Imagine the ultimate regret, the pain and the suffering, the infinite moment of agony if the rockets start falling, someone accidentally pushed the red button. and the opposite, imagine if you were trying your best to listen to the one thing that knows everything that also tells you how you can best use your gifts, your pensions, your natural inclinations, your place in the world, the relationships you have. to act in harmony with that, and if more people did this and connected with that part of us, if I didn't say please define love so that I can make sure that on Mars we have a checklist of loving people if I said, I feel deeply that I love you and I'm scared and I don't know what to do about it.  We could have had a very different conversation life would have been very different, but because I had that experience, I have a lesson. and I have a story and thankfully I have a turnaround because in 2004, I met the person whom I love today. And when I met her, the relationship didn't make sense. She was from a different part of the world.  She spoke a different language. We didn't resonate and play off of each other's creativity. wasn't a strong, you know, desire for intimacy was different. But I decided finally, for once in my life, I'm not going to think my way into a relationship and say, what will my parents think?  Does this make sense, according to the religion I was given? That was supposed to tell me who God was and how we want to live, and instead trust the thing that religions try to connect you with that part of us that can know truth. and when I met my wife and I held her, my shoulders dropped, I felt connected to my body and to her and there was a leaning towards there was a yes. And this is very early in our relationship. and so somehow I also kind of believe there's a non-emporal nature to that viewing, that complex system isn't just telling the story of the now that complex system that oneness is everything and every time and telling you now how to be a part of the beautiful story that wants to happen, and it's possible to listen to that.  And it requires only to trust small experiments towards becoming beautiful, and to think through logically and understand who we actually want to be. What are the worldviews that we've taken on? What are the schemas, the frameworks?  What do you think your feelings are? What do they imply? What do they mean?  Are they random? Why is it impossible to be satisfied? with so many options on Amazon and deliveroo and tinder What's happening?  What is good? I gave a talk once called good as hard. and it was about two people who chose two ways of being for two very different reasons. One chose it out of love love for their patience and developed the lobotomy, something that we now look back at and realize its tragedy, but in his time, his love defined its use case.  It was only for the most severe cases when nothing else would work, and it was only to protect themselves from themselves and their families. and it worked. The challenges people monopolized this procedure because they found a hack to do it faster and simpler and make it more efficient, and rather than risking life and having to make an incision in the skull and realize the immensity of that decision, they were able to use a thin metal stick and to use the tear duct behind the uh, right on top of the eye and to break the thin bone very easily at the back of the a bit lobe and and to conduct a lobotomy and the reasoning wasn't how best to help our patients was it let it became how can we do as many of these as possible for financial gain? and then people came back from world War II, injured and traumatized, and this rational way of thinking, this efficiency oriented way of thinking led to many more lobotomies being made than were needed, and Fritzaber, who out of fear and a desire for the longing and acceptance in a German state as a Jewish scientist decided he must solve the problem of the lack of fertilizers which were being blockaded from South America for the bombs that Germany wanted to make to kill, to conquer, to expand, to control.  And so in order to feel and to connect and to be a part of that society as someone who is at risk in that society as a Jewish person, he found a way to be useful to a death machine by creating the nitrogen fixing process. His nitrogen fixing process came from and an optimization of death. How can we make bombs out thinner?  And this technology became what fed our planet because we were able to create massively bulked produce around the world because we had nitrogen-based fertilizers that were easy to manufacture and produce, and so he wanted over a price and so did at germonitz, the inventor the lobotomy. Both of these people on stage receiving the novel Prius, must have felt differently. It must have been confusing, I imagine, for Fritzaber after the war, having his technology been used for other more humane purposes, but there seems to be something about this efficiency mindset, this orientation for something from nothing that requires nothing of us to be to extract out of thin air rather than to participate in the systems of guano and animals and digging in the dirt and people involvements and all of that rather than this mechanized world that turns air into little white pellets, and we see now that those nitrogen fertilizers are being overused are food is less nutritious the water in the Mississippi takes all that run off from the farms and creates a giant dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing can live. and initially, when I first gave this talk, I was still confused.  I didn't realize that good is hard, meant that it's possible too, know what is good, but you have to stay connected to the part of you that sees, and so innovate, invent the lobotomy, but for all of us that want to apply it, we have to apply it with that connection to both efficiency, rationality, optimization, protection, systems, and the part that knows goodness and beauty. And that part that knows goodness and beauty is a step back and it requires us to step back, requires us to look at the looking and to see what we're doing and to ask, and we know these things. I think in communities where we are mirrors to each other and this is why I've been working on this process that I call come alive because our lives depend on it.  I work in social entrepreneurship and social change and impact, and I realize the challenge that we have of instrumentalizing people, we have a perverse intent incentive sometimes when you see that we need problems to exist for our businesses to exist, so do we really want to solve it. rather than the business existing taking second priority to doing something that helps us come alive and give and just like that rope is real, just like the bird leaves and trusts and knows that like we live in a beautiful planet and we know it, you know. As long as we accept that we're a part of this amazing place in these systems, as long as we stay within these systems of nurturing life and give back to them as much as we take in a sense like staying beautiful, I think there is a way into safety and into old age and in whatever is beyond, just like the bird, the good the bird does for the trees that it eats its seeds is it spreads its seeds and its poop and so sometimes when we are deeply integrated in loving ways with each other and the systems that provide life, and we are coming alive even our accidental byproducts can be sources of life. And when we reduce our need for systems and for savings accounts and retirement funds, I really believe that life supports that which supports life. and getting into these ways of being in harmony and perceiving and pursuing that which is beautiful meaningful and true connecting our eye of rationality, where our eyes of intentional submission to the good, I think we're gonna be okay. that we will be able to change in this dynamic ever changing time because that is the nature of aliveness. the fear of the future, the rate of change, is a problem for Stasis, not of a liveness.  It doesn't matter if we get holographic lenses and, you know, telepresence at some point It's going to be okay. We will know how to live then because we will be able to know the thing that is timeless within us that brings the new way of being now that we're being wr rung again that my bell is in the key of C, and this is what it looks like here, echoing off of the auditorium malls. And so I think it sounds crazy.  I think I tried to do a good job explaining my personal experience. The philosophical rigor behind it, the logical sense that it makes the historical disconnect from Descartes and Galileo, and the consequences of materialism leading to the accruel of more material to capitalism, to neolioliberalism, and the consequences of these mindsets. stemming from a hyper focus of a single part of our rational and perceptual faculties, and that all the other forms of currency that are possible and wealth that are possible, and a fourth dimension in time, along with the other three, that expands because we have access to an infinite unfolding that is clear and is evoked in everyone's life at some point if they ask for their sources of meaning, like tell me about a meaningful moment what was happening. What were you attending to?  And in doing that we can clarify one of the ways that the infinite goodness and beauty wants to enter into this world into time through you and if we do that, and we tell these stories, I think we can be our own role model and the role model for each other. We can uplift through not self sacrifice and do well and do good or whatever. It's just do good and do well, you know?  We have to flip it. do well and trust that we will do good and that good might not look like the same million dollar bank account retirement fund where you can escape climate collapse, living in New Zealand that good might be dealing with climate collapse knee deepened the flooding waters, bailing people out of their homes and planting gardens on rooftops. That could be your good. That could be your safety.  That could be a life that you love not a life that is safe and protected. And these ways of talking about values and these ways of thinking are derived from my interpretation of Sufi metaphysics and Islamic philosophy, from Joe Edelman's work on attentional policies and sources of meaning derived also inspired by Charles Taylor and my interaction in silicon Valley and growing concern and feeling of distance from the ways I used to think and I was, you know, at some point wanting to create good with technology and it wasn't working. And then I thought, okay, well, social enterprise and it's not working.  Um, what's good, you know, and I wasn't feeling good and we were rushing and racing and I really believe that we cannot create good until we are good ourselves and a part of that is letting some of our fears go, our desire for self-p protection and trusting more and that we will get the things that we want. when we direct our soldiers ourselves towards the things that we want to give now, we see how the beauty wants to unfold in our lives, how goodness wants to unfold and that it's not about sacrificing our life to create a fair trade coffee company and make less money, but be good for the planet or being good. It's not about being good by our actions and our decisions. It's about letting goodness be us, letting the goodness flow, and we know that through inspirational stories and even stories in our own lives and can we really trust that this will lead us to being just the right thing at just the right time?  I've always been inspired by the quote, don't ask what the world needs, ask. what makes you come alive because the world needs more people that have come alive and that's from Howard Thurman, one of the Christian theologians that have inspired. Martin Luther King Jr. and I believe that and I didn't know why it was true until I said deeply reflecting on it and realizing that this coming alive is related to humility and that humility is also related to learning, and that all of this is connected through one of these models that you can think of similar to the flow state. There is, you know, complexity of task and skill as axes and there's like this Goldilock zone in the metal where it's just out of reach for you, right?  And this idea that we can place ourselves in over our heads and places where we don't have the skills competencies, networks, relationships, understanding, because we think it's good and create a mess and waste investors, money and waste our life and our time versus who am I and what is the most beautiful thing that I am connected to, that I see, that wants to flow through me. am I that person that, you know, has aension for medicine and studied and and loves it and and it comes easily to me and I strive and I'm at that growth edge constantly, but also knowing that there's so much more to learn and and then maybe, if you were in the fifties, you might be the right person. if you felt care and concern for your patience to give somebody a lobotomy if they had to have one, maybe that's the most beautiful thing you could have done then. But then now, as we think about our actions and trying to find product market fit or what the world needs, or look at the SDGs because smart people at the UN design this system rationally and they have indicators and measures for everything, but everyone becomes a means to an end, even if that end is to have a thriving productive business that solves one of the challenges of the SDGs, it is using people's misery or the planet's suffering for the preservation of a system that can address it, and part of that system is the preservation of your life and its financial needs within the system versus integrating into that moment an I see it as like a bottom up and a top down. It's not that I don't like SDGs, but I think we should count SDGs after the fact.  We should be encouraging people uplifting them, asking them what they need to learn with skills, what do they see, how do they want to respond, letting the world be the classroom so that they find their growth edge and how they're going to be participating in all times and let them develop this care and this love and this aesthetic sense, and let them connect to the arts and let them know what beauty feels like and let them connect to wonder and their let's not destroy their sense of curiosity and experimentation and expansion, and let that contrast with the trip to the landfill or to the Ganges river and and let them see what rings inside of them then, you know explore tell the world your story, the story of yourself have authentic action. I remember when I was younger I was working in Iraq and suddenly there was interest from international NGO's to fund women in tech businesses, and they popped up everywhere. And I'm wondering to today how many of them remained you know, they can evolve, they might evolve, they should evolve because the nature is a constant unflow unfolding of infinity into reality when you're connected to that place where beauty comes, and you can't stand still.  You will fall behind. You must be open daily, and it's a practice daily to unfold your wings to come down and to look, and to see what new blessings are brought and to feel grateful you know, we are talking about, you know, gratitude practices, practices, but a gratitude practice is sometimes not going to be able to touch people because there is also the practice of stability, safety and protection and I deserve this, which is the complete opposite of ingratitude. It's this expectation, it's this entitlement and entitlement comes with the same mind that says, I did rather than I saw and I responded, and this shift so important because we cannot see and respond if we don't have that faculty which we do, and I think with my process of just asking people to look at their to do lists and to find the tensions within it because I believe that we are always seeing there.  And so all the things that we're doing are either aligned with that or not, some of them will bring us to life and bring us joy, and some of us won't. Some of those things that are to do that we do because we have to, and we're not questioning, but with a little bit of insight, some questioning, looking at the why behind the things, we can see which part of us we're emphasizing and until their imbalance our way of seeing the world quantitatively a way of seeing the world of entitlement to life only if and when we have clearly created value that is described through dollars otherwise irrit charity case, and there is shame and guilt involved in here until we change that by balancing that way of seeing of doing, of acting, of with the way of receiving, I realizing now that all of what I'm saying is very Taoist sounding, but even just a little bit of Taoism. you have all that yang just put that dot of yin in there, you know, and see what happens and then maybe slowly you can dive into that and come out the other side in a world of yen and then be able to shrink back when it's time for prioritization, and I think Barbara Frederickson and her work on Broden and build can be another scientifically backed way of both philosophically and scientifically understanding how pursuing these expansive states makes it possible for you to be more yourself in the right place at the right time doing the right thing and be supported and get all the things that you wanted in a way where you can receive them. I think this problem with receiving is also a problem with how we're trying to get our needs meant.  And so here I am in France, having been unable to accept the love that wants to flow through me and now I have a baby. and I'm here with my wife and that inkling of maybe this is the person has become more and more true as our love has grown more and more deep, because we are looking together towards that which invites beauty into our lives, and this openness to a meaningful life, a deeper conversation, and uh lots of forgiveness has been a blessing and what I'm working towards in my life is for success to be every step. This little framework might rhyme with the act, therapy framework, and another frameworks, but I hope the story and this way of thinking is convincing and I'm curious if there's any critiques or ways of seeing that I am missing that can either improve it or change it or show me another way that I would find beautiful. So I hope you're having a beautiful day.  And that you're opening up day by day to that which makes you come alive."

              "content": "\n# The Crisis in Social Impact: When People Become Instruments\n\nThe crisis in social impact runs deeper than failed projects or inefficient programs. It stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what humans are and what makes life meaningful. We see this play out tragically in examples like microcredit, where what began as a beautiful vision of helping people out of poverty transformed into a transactional relationship between lender and borrower. When people become instruments for achieving metrics, we shouldn't be surprised when this leads to tragic outcomes like the spate of suicides among borrowers who couldn't meet repayment targets.\n\nThis instrumentalization shows up everywhere in the social sector. Large iNGOs create programs to generate jobs and employ refugees, meeting EU and UN metrics, but remain silent when wars threaten those same people's lives. Why? Because their systems are built to count jobs, not honor human beings. The metrics become more real than the people they're meant to serve.\n\nEven in our own work at Bloom, I've watched this tension play out. We built software to track tasks, create dashboards, monitor progress – all the things funders want to see. We tried to use the techniques of Facebook, Instagram, and Duolingo to \"hook\" people into good habits. But I've come to realize these techniques themselves are the problem. They're built on assumptions about humans that deny our capacity for meaning and reflection.\n\nThink about Duolingo's streaks: You might maintain a perfect streak learning French without actually caring about French or being able to speak it. You're responding to the metric, not the meaning. This is what happens when we prioritize measurement over life – we get perfect streaks instead of real learning, job numbers instead of human flourishing, repayment rates instead of actual poverty reduction.\n\nThe problem isn't measurement itself. We could measure different things – moments of meaning people experience at work, the emergence of new capabilities, the quality of connections formed. But first we need to shift from seeing people as instruments for achieving goals to seeing them as sources of meaning and beauty waiting to emerge.\n\nInstead of treating social impact like a machine where we input resources and extract metrics, what if we thought of it more like gardening? There's humility in planting seeds, amazement when the tomatoes appear, acceptance that some seasons yield more than others. Our goals could be like fruits – important to anticipate but not to force. The real work is in preparing the soil, understanding the conditions that allow life to flourish, and trusting in the natural unfolding of growth.\n\nThis requires a fundamental shift in how we approach social impact. Instead of starting with metrics and working backward, we need to start with meaning and let the right measures emerge. Instead of using \"engagement techniques\" to hook people into good habits, we need to create spaces where people can discover what naturally draws their attention. Instead of treating people as means to achieve SDGs or impact metrics, we need to honor them as ends in themselves.\n\nThe crisis isn't just that our current approach isn't working well enough – it's that it's working exactly as designed, treating humans as instruments rather than sources of meaning. To address this, we need more than better metrics or more efficient systems. We need a completely different way of seeing.\n",

              "content": "# The Crisis in Social Impact: From Factory Farms to Food Forests\n\nImagine two ways of growing food: A factory farm and a food forest. The factory farm operates on desperate arithmetic: this much fertilizer plus this much soil must equal this much yield and this much profit. Everything is monitored, measured, controlled. When anything goes wrong - a late frost, a new pest - the whole fragile system risks collapse. The farmer, despite all their planning and control, can still go bankrupt.\n\nNow imagine a food forest: diverse, alive, resilient. Every plant, insect, and microorganism participates in countless feedback cycles too complex to measure. The system works not because someone controls it, but because everything in it is fully alive, being exactly what it is, contributing naturally to the whole.\n\nThis contrast captures the fundamental crisis in social impact work today. We're trying to run social change like a factory farm when it needs to be grown like a food forest. We see this everywhere:\n\nMicrocredit programs achieve perfect repayment rates while borrowers commit suicide. iNGOs create thousands of refugee jobs while remaining silent when wars threaten those same refugees' lives. Our metrics look beautiful on paper while the human spirit withers. We're getting exactly what we measure, but missing what matters most.\n\nEven in our own work at Bloom, I've watched this pattern play out. We built systems to track tasks, create dashboards, monitor progress – trying to \"optimize\" human development like crop yields. We borrowed techniques from Facebook and Instagram to \"hook\" people into good habits, as if meaningful change could be manufactured like factory tomatoes.\n\nThe problem goes deeper than failed projects or inefficient programs. It stems from a fundamental desire for control and domination – even when that domination wears a beautiful mask. \"We're planting trees! We're employing refugees! We're reducing CO2!\" But if we're still forcing things to happen according to our predetermined metrics rather than allowing life to unfold naturally, we're still operating from domination, not aliveness.\n\nConsider how bureaucracy and automation increasingly remove human judgment from human situations. When a starving person steals from a store, rigid policies demand banishment – no space for the beautiful moment where forgiveness and a job offer might transform two lives. When billions of people interact through automated systems, there's no room for human wisdom to emerge.\n\nThis isn't just ineffective – it's dangerous. Just as factory farming creates fragile systems dependent on artificial inputs, our metrics-driven approach to social impact creates programs that look good on paper but collapse under real-world complexity. We're optimizing for what we can measure while missing the immeasurable qualities that make life worth living.\n\nThe solution isn't better metrics. We could measure different things – moments of meaning people experience at work, instances of unexpected generosity, the quality of connections formed. But first we need to shift from seeing people as outputs to manage to sources of beauty waiting to emerge.\n\nWhat if instead of trying to control outcomes, we focused on creating conditions where people can understand themselves, understand the world, and respond with what they think is best in every moment? What if instead of measuring success by predetermined metrics, we looked for signs of life: Are people experiencing moments of meaning at work? Are they living their values? Are beautiful, unexpected solutions emerging naturally?\n\nThis requires radical humility. Like a gardener who knows they don't create the tomatoes – they just create conditions where tomatoes can grow – we need to shift from manufacturing impact to nurturing aliveness. This isn't just a different approach to social impact. It's a different way of seeing what humans are and what makes life meaningful.\n",

              "content": "# The Crisis in Social Impact: Lost Gardens, Lost Ways of Seeing\n\nImagine two ways of growing food: A factory farm and a food forest. The factory farm operates on desperate arithmetic: this much fertilizer plus this much soil must equal this much yield and this much profit. Everything is monitored, measured, controlled. The food forest, by contrast, is diverse, alive, resilient - every plant, insect, and microorganism participating in countless feedback cycles too complex to measure.\n\nBut why do we default to factory farming approaches, not just in agriculture but in social change? The answer lies in how we've come to see human nature. We've inherited a worldview - from Descartes through Hobbes to Darwin - that sees humans as essentially self-interested machines, biological computers trying to survive and reproduce, potentially at others' expense. From this view, emergence means chaos. Without control, we assume we'll get violence, not beauty.\n\nThis belief acts like an invisible electric fence - even when the power is off, we won't cross it. We say \"I have to get ahead,\" \"We have to defend ourselves,\" \"We have to measure everything\" as if these are laws of nature rather than choices emerging from fear. We've lost trust in our natural capacity to perceive and pursue what's beautiful and true.\n\nWe see this pattern everywhere in social impact work:\n- Microcredit programs achieve perfect repayment rates while borrowers commit suicide\n- iNGOs create thousands of refugee jobs while remaining silent when wars threaten those same refugees' lives\n- Organizations hit their metrics while the human spirit withers\n\nBut this approach isn't just ineffective - it's based on a profound misunderstanding of human nature. People will literally die for meaning, beauty, and love. We have a natural capacity to recognize what's sacred, what's life-giving, what's true. The problem isn't that people need to be controlled - it's that we've lost touch with our ability to perceive and act from meaning.\n\nThis isn't about unleashing raw emotion or unconscious impulses. Many destructive patterns emerge from unexamined fears and wounds. Instead, it's about developing our capacity to look through emotions to what they point toward - our deepest sources of meaning and beauty. When we touch these, we enter a different state entirely - not a fleeting feeling but a recognition of something real and true.\n\nWhat if instead of trying to control outcomes, we focused on creating conditions where people can access this natural capacity for recognition? What if instead of measuring success by predetermined metrics, we looked for signs of life: Are people experiencing moments of meaning at work? Are they living their values? Are beautiful, unexpected solutions emerging naturally?\n\nThis requires radically rethinking how we approach change. Like a gardener who knows they don't create the tomatoes - they just create conditions where tomatoes can grow - we need to shift from manufacturing impact to nurturing aliveness. The food forest isn't anxiously waiting for apples; even the decaying leaves in winter are a sign of life doing exactly what it should.\n\nEvery item on our to-do lists reveals this pattern: How many are \"have to's\" driven by fear and control? How many are \"want to's\" emerging from our recognition of what's beautiful and meaningful? Our organizations show the same divide: How much space do we make for the slower, qualitative perception that knows what's truly important?\n\nThis isn't just about better methods or metrics. It's about recovering our lost capacity to recognize and align with beauty. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning - that help us purify our fears and nurture our natural attraction to what's true and good.\n\nThe crisis in social impact isn't ultimately about failed projects or inefficient programs. It's about a way of seeing that has forgotten half of what it means to be human. To address this, we need more than better systems - we need to rediscover our natural capacity for recognizing and creating beauty.",

I have to get into a place where I can know and so I can love and so I can live and so I can do from Hey. Like non instrumental, nonrational sort of I'm doing this for something. Right? Like, for myself, for my career, for whatever so that it can be for itself and so I can be there willingly and lovingly. And and I actually, you know, took the inspiration to move to to Beirut, and I opened up my home. And even to this day, I have, like, dear friends that used to be refugees, used to be know, living on the streets and polishing shoes and running away from the cops. And I don't say this to instrumentalize them now, but really important to tell the story to say, like, I would have never been able to love these people if I didn't listen and follow my heart. Also, similarly with my wife right now. Like, when I met her, none of the reasons added up. Right? So for instance, Like, she didn't speak No. English. She had no idea anything about the Middle East. She was French. And she was gonna go back to France and I didn't have this overwhelming feeling of desire or whatever. Right? Like, all of the checklist idea of a spreadsheet dating, people have these days actually have spreadsheets, and my friends actually make spreadsheets, and they compare people. And it just doesn't make sense to me, and I had wanted to listen to something else, and scary. And I tried really hard And now I have a life that emerging and it's beautiful and and I feel confident And my choices. Even if it's hard, you know, that I'm far from my family. I live in France. But I see my baby and he's beautiful. And I'm surprised by what happens the more I open up to this perception of beauty and ask, like, what wants to happen rather than what do I want to happen? And that like, this tense saying ourselves from the I, I think, is a part The amazing part of all of this, and it's it's the eye that has the fear. It's the eye that has the self protection. It's the eye that has all these things. And instead of asking, like, what do I want? It's asking what wants to happen. And when you ask that, can explore with the possibility of beauty that wants to unfold through you. And what that is, I'll I'll let people experience and understand. But for my life, I can say that it's guided me well. Yeah. So Some somehow, like, the garden process and trusting a process and you know, starting this, hackerspace in Michigan and at some point, you know, bringing, beautiful people in and empowering them and Seeing, how at some point, even The told me that I needed to change my perspective on some things to maintain the sustainability of the space. So for instance, you know, I had this idea of everything is free for everyone all the time. One pays for anything, and all decisions are consensus. And they push back. You know? The people that were drawn to the inspiration, to the idea, this kind of open space that I was holding for people to kind of co manage, co own, co run this thing. They went from consensus to democracy. And from consensus and free to democratic and, paid with tears. And they understood the need to have these tears, a student here, low income tier, and then even a free tier for someone who wants to volunteer or contribute because they saw that it was just the right thing to do. To be able to sustain the thing. And and the beautiful thing that I want to do to, like, open the space and welcome the people Claude to this other beautiful emergence that was totally different than the thing that I thought would be good. Right? And now 13 years later, All Hands Active is still a hackerspace that provides value in Ann Arbor, Michigan, And things that I tried to, you know, micromanage and control, those things disappear. But things that I open up and allow to be in service preserver and produce value and sustain value. Whether or not I capture the value I think it's related to how much I'm actually engaging and giving the Right? And so idea of capturing value is really funny, but, you know, supports that which supports life, and I think it's really important. Disconnects from self, nature, each other in everyday terms. Yeah. I feel like these days, you can see that we have this kind of disc from each other and the rise of polarization and disconnects from self and you know, the rise of anxiety levels and suicide rates and disconnects from, nature, and we can see the impact on ecology and this is like the disconnecting element of this, reason where it's you versus the world. And it's you as a mind watching material substance out there. And I think that this disconnect is a big part of how we can a lot of the problems. And I think other people talk about this better than I do. It'll be interesting to know what their names were and what what philosophers are saying. What's at stake in human terms? Yeah. So when they don't have access to that faculty, they're missing the access to the thing that knows goodness, beauty, and truth without interpretation.

And you know at your core, what the right thing to do is. And if you are kind of pursuing that, you you experience moments that touch you with your source of meaning and bring you to life. And so this eye of seeing is the thing that brings you to life. And we talk about flourishing and well-being measures and all these other things that we want, And you can try to go at them, like, 1 at a time and look at positive emotions and relationships and engagements and flow and Meaning and Achievement. And health. Right? The framework from Seligman. Or I think a lot of that can emerge from the meaning element and allowing the aliveness and the answer, like, the the reason to ask, okay. Well, if that's what I feel, and that's what's true, not feel. That's what I that is what I recognize and sense. That's true. What do I do? How do I live? What do I need? What relationships? What How does us all kinda work together? You get the positive emotion. You get things that you need. But not from this forcing way.",

              "content": "# The Crisis in Social Impact: Recovering Our Capacity to See\n\nYears ago, I heard Father Greg Boyle explain why he worked with gang members. He didn't talk about metrics or impact or solving problems. He said simply: \"They're my friends.\" Something clicked for me in that moment. I realized how much of my \"social impact\" work had been instrumental - doing things for my career, for metrics, for some future outcome - rather than being fully present to the humans in front of me.\n\nThis insight changed everything. I moved to Beirut and opened my home. Some of my dearest friends today were once refugees living on the streets, polishing shoes, running from police. This isn't a story about impact - it's about what becomes possible when we trust a different way of seeing.\n\nI learned this lesson again when I met my wife. On paper, nothing added up. She didn't speak English, knew nothing about the Middle East, was planning to return to France. Friends these days make actual spreadsheets comparing potential partners. But something else spoke - quieter than desire, deeper than logic. Following this recognition was terrifying. Now I watch our baby grow, surprised and grateful at the beauty that unfolds when we ask not \"what do I want?\" but \"what wants to happen?\"\n\nThese personal stories point to a broader pattern playing out everywhere in social impact work. We've inherited approaches built on control and measurement rather than recognition and emergence. Like factory farms forcing maximum yield through artificial inputs, we try to manufacture impact through metrics and optimization. We see the results all around us:\n- Rising anxiety and suicide rates showing our disconnect from self\n- Increasing polarization showing our disconnect from each other\n- Ecological collapse showing our disconnect from nature\n\nBut there's another way, more like growing a food forest than running a factory farm. I experienced this with a hackerspace I started in Michigan. Initially, I had rigid ideas: everything free, all decisions by consensus. But I learned to trust the people drawn to the space. They saw needs I couldn't see, evolved the model to include tiered pricing and democratic decision-making. Thirteen years later, All Hands Active still serves its community - not because I controlled it, but because I learned to let something beautiful emerge.\n\nThis isn't about abandoning metrics or rationality. It's about recovering our natural capacity to recognize what's true, beautiful, and good - without needing to analyze or justify it. We all have this faculty, this way of seeing that knows when something rings true. But we've been taught to distrust it, to rely instead on spreadsheets and impact measurements.\n\nThe cost is enormous. When we can't access this faculty for recognizing quality and meaning, we miss the very thing that makes life worth living. We can pursue all the elements of wellbeing - positive emotions, relationships, engagement, achievement - but they feel hollow when manufactured rather than emerging naturally from meaning.\n\nWhat if instead of trying to optimize and control, we focused on creating conditions where beauty and meaning can naturally emerge? What if instead of measuring predetermined outcomes, we developed our capacity to recognize and respond to what life is calling for?\n\nThis isn't just about better methods or metrics. It's about recovering a lost way of seeing - one that could transform how we approach social change. To understand why this matters and how to move forward, we need to look more deeply at how we lost this capacity and what it takes to recover it.",

              "content": "# The Crisis in Social Impact: What We Measure vs What Matters\n\nIn 2006, Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering microcredit - small loans that would lift millions out of poverty. The metrics were perfect: high repayment rates, growing reach, measurable income increases. By every standard measure, it was working. Yet by 2010, something disturbing emerged in Indian newspapers: a wave of suicides among borrowers. How could a program be simultaneously succeeding by every metric and failing so fundamentally at its human mission?\n\nThis pattern - of initiatives that succeed on paper while missing something essential - shows up everywhere in social impact work. Organizations hit their KPIs while their staff burn out. Refugee programs create thousands of jobs while remaining silent when those same refugees face existential threats. Environmental projects count trees planted while ecosystems collapse.\n\nThe easy response is to blame bad metrics - to say we're measuring the wrong things. But what if the problem goes deeper? What if it's not just about what we measure, but about our belief that measurement alone can guide us toward what matters?\n\nI learned this lesson personally when I heard Father Greg Boyle explain why he worked with gang members. He didn't talk about recidivism rates or impact metrics. He said simply: \"They're my friends.\" Something clicked for me. I realized how much of my \"social impact\" work had been instrumental - doing things for metrics, for my career, for some future outcome - rather than being fully present to the humans in front of me.\n\nThis isn't about abandoning metrics or rationality. That would be like saying because black and white photography misses color, we should stop taking pictures. Metrics aren't wrong - they're incomplete. They capture important patterns but miss essential qualities, like trying to understand a garden by measuring only height and yield.\n\nConsider two ways of growing food: A factory farm and a food forest. The factory farm operates on pure metrics: this much fertilizer plus this much soil must equal this much yield. Everything is monitored, measured, controlled. The food forest, by contrast, is diverse, alive, resilient - every plant, insect, and microorganism participating in countless feedback cycles too complex to measure. Both produce food, but one creates fragile systems dependent on artificial inputs while the other builds lasting vitality.\n\nI experienced this contrast directly when I started a hackerspace in Michigan. Initially, I had rigid ideas: everything free, all decisions by consensus - metrics for maximum accessibility and democracy. But something unexpected happened when I learned to trust the people drawn to the space. They saw needs I couldn't see, evolved the model to include tiered pricing and new governance. They made it less \"perfect\" by my original metrics but more alive, more sustainable. Thirteen years later, that space still serves its community - not because I controlled it, but because I learned to let something beautiful emerge.\n\nThis pattern shows up in our personal lives too. When I met my wife, nothing added up on paper. She didn't speak English, knew nothing about my culture, was planning to return to France. Friends these days make actual spreadsheets comparing potential partners. But something else spoke - quieter than desire, deeper than logic. Now I watch our baby grow, surprised and grateful at the beauty that unfolds when we ask not \"what do I want?\" but \"what wants to happen?\"\n\nThe most successful organizations aren't succeeding because they found perfect metrics. They're succeeding because they've learned to complement measurement with a deeper way of seeing - one that recognizes quality and meaning directly, without needing to quantify everything. They use metrics like a good gardener uses soil tests: as one tool among many, always in service of the living whole.\n\nThis capacity for recognizing quality isn't mystical or anti-rational. We all have it. It's what lets us know when something rings true, when a solution fits, when a community is thriving. But we've been taught to distrust it, to rely instead on spreadsheets and impact measurements. The cost is enormous - not just in failed programs and burnout, but in our diminished capacity to address the complex challenges we face.\n\nClimate change, social polarization, rising mental health crises - these aren't problems we can optimize our way out of. They require a different way of seeing that can recognize patterns too complex to measure, that can sense what wants to emerge rather than forcing predetermined outcomes.\n\nThe crisis in social impact isn't ultimately about failed metrics. It's about a way of seeing that has forgotten half of what it means to be human. To understand why this matters and how to move forward, we need to look more deeply at how we lost this capacity and what it takes to recover it.",

And so we have in his story, like, someone who had doubt and talked about quality and quantity But they latched on to his whole thing about the language of the universe is mathematics and From there, I think Now Yeah. And I think metrics post World War 2 and just, like, fear of uncontrolled human behavior. Right? Like, unchecked, and trying to create this sort of win win situation according to something that everyone kind of understand Android I progress and, like, you know, a lot of the world war 1 and 2, related to the shame and humiliation and poverty and you know, like, Germany's economic situation. So the idea was like, progress. Like, you know, let's just show development and progress and counter cap communism and to kind of no one should be feel shame and know, Fukayama, the end of history, and that's like everyone does what they do best. You know, as a country. But, like, who cares about the people? Anymore when it's the countries. You know? And and then it sort of reminds me of, like, The collapse of Rome and how they used to build, like, these colossums to entertain people Like, here's stuff to do, you know. Watch television, efficiency, streamline, whatever. And just kind of lose the sense of aliveness and agency that can threaten systems, by creating new, you know, and this whole disruption from technology And then kind of the incorporation of technology into our bureaucracies and like, the following the the money iOS is like the the highest, like, meta goal that even countries and businesses are not exactly competing around, but, like, developing within And and I think there's something in there that's interesting to to extrapolate and to to see. Like, both of these things are using money as broadest measure of progress and it requires docility or, like, domestication in a sense of human agency and to be subordinated into systems where your, like, sustenance is hinged and contingent on your participation in a game. Right? You're a grade a student, so you get the grade a job and you get the grade a salary, which puts you into a perpetual cycle of needing the job to be able pay the mortgage, to be able to pay the lease, to be able to sustain your life. But then there's people that actually design the systems that are You know? Outside of them. And I think that's very interesting. Yeah. I would like getting statistics on the rising burnout in the social sector and mental health. Trends, I think that would be really important Yeah. Indigenous cultures maintain different ways of seeing. In their stories, in their religious views and myself understanding I think social impact started adopting business metrics once we stopped really relying on you know, church missions to Africa to give good. Right? Instead of relying more on having Especially social entrepreneurship. It's like, okay. Well, We don't want to give aid forever overseas And so let's focus on giving social enterprises a little bit of aid to be able to leverage the little bit of money that we have, and that kind of took some, took a lot of the business, elements Yeah. It was bringing Charles Taylor's work on instruments for all reason and Joe Edelman's work Martin Buber's I, Ed, verse I, Thou, and Eric Frome, I think, are is interesting. And yeah, the sufi understanding is definitely important. It's one that I know best. Yeah. Embodied cognition. I think would be great to talk about and think of with did I first notice this pattern institutions? What reading, thinking, So I think, like, growing up, I was always told this life is a journey. And it's important to think about how you're gonna die. And what does that mean? You know? And I've always had these kind of existential questions about, like, what am I supposed to do with my life? And what is good? What is right? What is beautiful? And Yeah. I think reading and meditating and mindfulness and going through sort of the existential crises of, like, working in the Middle East and witnessing car bombs and seeing my work and, like, second guessing myself and, like, what supporting social enterprises when things are literally exploding and people are literally dying, like, am I doing anything good? What is the point? You know? I said it had me this, like, doubt And I that's why I started focusing more and more on, like, connecting people with themselves and with each other and with what I know, didn't really realize at the time was like, can I think the sources of meaning And also still staying in, like, the social impact space, but stuff that I cared about was Not the impact it was, like, the being And I now I have, like, a better way of understanding how to bring them together, I think? How does it relate to AI and automation? Yeah. I think we talked about it. Right? That AI can digest all of the output and the quantity, but not any of the quality. And automation is something that we would never want to give for something that brings us a source of meaning. And so You know, crafting a life that you want to live and I use that word craft very literally and explicitly here. Is going to be touching things that are meaningful for you that is impossible to even articulate because it's Infinite. And vast and beyond our ability to put into words. And so need to experience them and know them and see them as sources of guidance, but not necessarily and realize that necessarily. We can't teach it to the AI. AI is not gonna be moral It's going to require us to stay connected to that sense that we have, that qualitative sense that is impossible to bring into the AI. Do we need to define it and describe it in I'm like the Microtubules inside of our DNA that are being proposed by These mathematicians and anesthesiologists, scientists. Right? Like, we're trying to find the The origin of consciousness and what's the difference between consciousness, the witnesser, quality, quantity, perception. It doesn't doesn't matter, but, like, we really need to start touching quality. We can theorize a little bit about where arises from and what it is. Is it God? Is it microtubules? Is it quantum states? Or do we just want to know that it's real and it's there and it's reliable and trustable And that we can do with evidence, and that's what kind of Ken Wilbur says in his book, The Marriage of Sense and Soul is like, Zen masters show you that you can know very reliably where somebody is on their like, evolutionary path of, development. And they can tell you this person needs these meditations to get from this stage to the next stage, and this is the stage that they're at because they've had 1000 plus years of experiments with inner knowledge and insight, and that's a science. And so we need that science to be as real as possible, not necessarily to know that this is because of microtubules or some other like, materialist reductionist perspective. We need to know that it's it's reliable, real, and trustworthy. And to do that, we need to live it, test it, and enact it, and then talk about it clearly. With each other and not gaslight ourselves into ignoring it. And I think that relates to rising inequality and social media and ESG and climate crisis because all these things are like Things that we can address by touching that, seeing that and then talking honestly about what are hearts tell us to do. And I use the word heart, but Whatever you wanna call it, that perception is.",

You're a grade a student, so you get the grade a job and you get the grade a salary, which puts you into a perpetual cycle of needing the job to be able pay the mortgage, to be able to pay the lease, to be able to sustain your life. But then there's people that actually design the systems that are You know? Outside of them. And I think that's very interesting. Yeah. I would like getting statistics on the rising burnout in the social sector and mental health. Trends, I think that would be really important Yeah. Indigenous cultures maintain different ways of seeing. In their stories, in their religious views and myself understanding I think social impact started adopting business metrics once we stopped really relying on you know, church missions to Africa to give good. Right? Instead of relying more on having Especially social entrepreneurship. It's like, okay. Well, We don't want to give aid forever overseas And so let's focus on giving social enterprises a little bit of aid to be able to leverage the little bit of money that we have, and that kind of took some, took a lot of the business, elements Yeah. It was bringing Charles Taylor's work on instruments for all reason and Joe Edelman's work Martin Buber's I, Ed, verse I, Thou, and Eric Frome, I think, are is interesting. And yeah, the sufi understanding is definitely important. It's one that I know best. Yeah. Embodied cognition. I think would be great to talk about and think of with did I first notice this pattern institutions? What reading, thinking, So I think, like, growing up, I was always told this life is a journey. And it's important to think about how you're gonna die. And what does that mean? You know? And I've always had these kind of existential questions about, like, what am I supposed to do with my life? And what is good? What is right? What is beautiful? And Yeah. I think reading and meditating and mindfulness and going through sort of the existential crises of, like, working in the Middle East and witnessing car bombs and seeing my work and, like, second guessing myself and, like, what supporting social enterprises when things are literally exploding and people are literally dying, like, am I doing anything good? What is the point? You know? I said it had me this, like, doubt And I that's why I started focusing more and more on, like, connecting people with themselves and with each other and with what I know, didn't really realize at the time was like, can I think the sources of meaning And also still staying in, like, the social impact space, but stuff that I cared about was Not the impact it was, like, the being And I now I have, like, a better way of understanding how to bring them together, I think? How does it relate to AI and automation? Yeah. I think we talked about it. Right? That AI can digest all of the output and the quantity, but not any of the quality. And automation is something that we would never want to give for something that brings us a source of meaning. And so You know, crafting a life that you want to live and I use that word craft very literally and explicitly here. Is going to be touching things that are meaningful for you that is impossible to even articulate because it's Infinite. And vast and beyond our ability to put into words. And so need to experience them and know them and see them as sources of guidance, but not necessarily and realize that necessarily. We can't teach it to the AI. AI is not gonna be moral It's going to require us to stay connected to that sense that we have, that qualitative sense that is impossible to bring into the AI. Do we need to define it and describe it in I'm like the Microtubules inside of our DNA that are being proposed by These mathematicians and anesthesiologists, scientists. Right? Like, we're trying to find the The origin of consciousness and what's the difference between consciousness, the witnesser, quality, quantity, perception. It doesn't doesn't matter, but, like, we really need to start touching quality. We can theorize a little bit about where arises from and what it is. Is it God? Is it microtubules? Is it quantum states? Or do we just want to know that it's real and it's there and it's reliable and trustable And that we can do with evidence, and that's what kind of Ken Wilbur says in his book, The Marriage of Sense and Soul is like, Zen masters show you that you can know very reliably where somebody is on their like, evolutionary path of, development. And they can tell you this person needs these meditations to get from this stage to the next stage, and this is the stage that they're at because they've had 1000 plus years of experiments with inner knowledge and insight, and that's a science. And so we need that science to be as real as possible, not necessarily to know that this is because of microtubules or some other like, materialist reductionist perspective. We need to know that it's it's reliable, real, and trustworthy. And to do that, we need to live it, test it, and enact it, and then talk about it clearly. With each other and not gaslight ourselves into ignoring it. And I think that relates to rising inequality and social media and ESG and climate crisis because all these things are like Things that we can address by touching that, seeing that and then talking honestly about what are hearts tell us to do. And I use the word heart, but Whatever you wanna call it, that perception is.",

              "content": "# The Great Forgetting: How We Lost Our Way of Seeing\n\nWhen Galileo declared mathematics the language of the universe, he added an important caveat: this new science could measure quantity but not quality. Yet in our enthusiasm for the power of measurement, we forgot the second part of his insight. This forgetting reshaped how we see ourselves, nature, and purpose itself.\n\nThe story of how we lost touch with quality isn't just academic history - it shows up in our daily lives. Consider how we \"grade\" students: A through F, reducing complex human development to single letters. Those grades determine access to opportunities, which determine income, which determines where you can live and what choices you can make. We've built elaborate systems that require us to subordinate our natural sense of what matters to what can be measured.\n\nThis pattern emerged gradually:\n\nFirst, we separated mind from body, observer from observed. What Descartes intended as a philosophical investigation became a deep cultural assumption: that the thinking mind is separate from and superior to what it observes. This made it easier to see nature - and eventually ourselves - as machines to be optimized rather than living wholes to be understood.\n\nThen we narrowed cause and effect. Ancient thinkers like Aristotle saw multiple kinds of causation, including purpose and meaning. But the Scientific Revolution's success at predicting physical mechanics led us to prioritize only what could be measured and manipulated. The universe became a clockwork mechanism rather than a living reality.\n\nFinally, we institutionalized this view. After World War II, traumatized by human irrationality and seeking stability, we built systems designed to control through measurement. GDP became the measure of national wellbeing. Standardized tests determined children's futures. Even social impact adopted business metrics, trying to quantify human flourishing.\n\nThe results surround us:\n- Burnout rates in the social sector have risen 45% since 2019\n- Youth anxiety and depression have doubled in the past decade\n- Environmental indicators improve while ecosystems collapse\n[Note: We should verify exact statistics]\n\nYet alternative ways of seeing persisted. Indigenous cultures maintained traditions that recognize quality and meaning directly. Contemplative practices preserved techniques for developing this perception. Even within modern institutions, people found ways to honor what couldn't be measured.\n\nConsider the Zen tradition's approach to development: Masters can reliably recognize practitioners' states and prescribe appropriate practices, not through measurement but through direct perception refined over centuries. This isn't mystical - it's a rigorous science of quality, as precise in its way as physics.\n\nOr consider how social media tries to quantify human connection through likes and shares while actual loneliness increases. The metrics improve while the meaning diminishes. We see this pattern everywhere: better measurements, worse outcomes.\n\nNow we face challenges that can't be solved through measurement alone:\n- Climate change requires sensing whole systems\n- AI forces us to articulate what makes human experience meaningful\n- Rising inequality shows the limits of purely economic metrics\n- Mental health crises reveal our need for unquantifiable meaning\n\nThe good news is that we haven't lost this capacity entirely. Like a muscle weakened from disuse, our ability to perceive quality directly can be redeveloped. We don't need to reject measurement - we need to reintegrate it with our natural capacity for recognizing what matters.\n\nThis isn't about finding the neurological basis of consciousness or proving quality exists materially. As philosopher Ken Wilber notes, we can verify the reliability of qualitative perception through practice and experience, just as we verify scientific findings through experiment and observation.\n\nThe challenge now is to create conditions where this capacity can re-emerge - in ourselves, our organizations, and our societies. Not to replace quantitative thinking but to complement it with the quality-perceiving intelligence we've always had.\n\nThe question isn't whether this faculty exists - we use it every time we recognize beauty, truth, or meaning. The question is whether we'll remember how to trust it, develop it, and let it guide us alongside our capacity for measurement and analysis.\n\nIn the next section, we'll explore how to develop this capacity practically...",

The tint becomes your \"normal,\" invisibly filtering everything you see. This is how foundational beliefs work: they don't just influence our thoughts, they shape what we can perceive in the first place.\n\nConsider how deeply Darwinian thinking has shaped our view of human nature. Even after rejecting Social Darwinism's overt racism, we still unconsciously assume humans are fundamentally self-interested creatures needing control and management. This shows up everywhere: in how we design organizations, create incentives, measure impact.\n\nBut archaeologists like David Graeber tell a different story. The discovery of healed femurs from prehistoric humans reveals communities that cared for injured members who couldn't contribute materially for months or years. This isn't explainable through pure survival logic - it suggests humans have always been capable of acting from meaning and beauty rather than mere utility.\n\nThis isn't just academic history. These ancient examples reveal possibilities our current worldview renders invisible. Just as a fish doesn't know it's in water, we don't notice how thoroughly market logic and materialist assumptions shape what we imagine possible.\n\nSome symptoms of our inherited blindness:\n- Assuming people need external incentives to do good\n- Treating meaning as a \"soft\" factor secondary to metrics\n- Seeing nature as resource rather than relationship\n- Believing control produces better outcomes than emergence\n\nThe challenge isn't just adopting new ideas but recognizing how deeply old ones shape our perception. It's not enough to intellectually accept that humans can act from meaning - we need to rediscover our capacity to perceive and act from it directly.\n\nThis is why simply adding new metrics or methods isn't enough.

              "content": "# The Beautiful Risk: What Sacrifice Reveals About Perception\n\nWhen humans choose beauty over safety, meaning over survival, they reveal something profound about our nature. These moments aren't explicable through evolutionary logic or rational self-interest. They point to a different way of seeing that recognizes something more fundamental than physical survival.\n\nConsider the archeological evidence: Early human communities caring for disabled members who couldn't contribute materially. Indigenous traditions of ceremonial giving that prioritize beauty and meaning over accumulation. These aren't aberrations - they reveal a capacity humans have always had to perceive and act from meaning directly.\n\nWe're moved to tears by stories of sacrifice for beauty: \n- A father running back into a burning building for his child\n- A community protecting refugees despite threat to themselves\n- Artists dedicating lives to work that might never be recognized\n- Whistleblowers choosing truth over security\n\nWhy do these stories move us so deeply? Because they reveal what we already know but often forget: that there are things worth more than survival, that beauty and meaning aren't luxury add-ons to life but its very essence.\n\nThis has profound implications for social impact work:\n\nCurrent Approach:\n- Assumes people need incentives to do good\n- Focuses on minimizing risk\n- Measures what's countable over what matters\n- Treats meaning as secondary to metrics\n\nWhat Sacrifice Reveals:\n- Humans naturally move toward beauty when they can see it\n- Risk and sacrifice can be appropriate responses to meaning\n- Our capacity to recognize quality is more reliable than metrics\n- Beauty/meaning are primary motivators, not afterthoughts\n\nThis isn't about romanticizing sacrifice or ignoring practical needs. It's about recognizing that our capacity to perceive and act from meaning is fundamental to human nature. When we design systems assuming otherwise, we create the very self-interest we're trying to control.\n\nThe question for social impact isn't \"How do we incentivize good behavior?\" but \"How do we create conditions where people can recognize and act from meaning naturally?\" Not \"How do we minimize risk?\" but \"How do we support beautiful risk-taking?\"\n\nThis requires recovering our trust in the faculty that recognizes beauty and meaning directly. Not as emotional impulse but as a way of seeing more fundamental than rational analysis - the capacity that lets us know, without calculation, that saving a child from a burning building is right, that protecting refugees is beautiful, that truth matters more than comfort.\n\nWhen we trust this perception, we don't need external incentives or control systems. Like the early humans who cared for injured members, we naturally move toward what we recognize as beautiful and meaningful, even at personal cost. This isn't irrational - it's a deeper rationality that recognizes meaning as fundamental to life as breath.",

It was about a system that had made human dignity subordinate to control and metrics.\n\nConsider another pattern of sacrifice from our time: the wave of suicides among microfinance borrowers. These deaths weren't acts of protest or sacrifice for meaning - they were the result of systems that claimed to serve human flourishing while actually crushing it under repayment schedules and metrics.\n\nThese two patterns of sacrifice reveal something crucial about our relationship to meaning:\n\nThe Sacrifice of Despair:\n- Microfinance suicides\n- Deaths from workplace burnout\n- Rising youth mental health crises\n- Lives crushed by bureaucratic systems\n\nThese happen when systems designed to \"help\" actually strip life of meaning, reducing humans to metrics and outcomes.\n\nThe Sacrifice for Meaning:\n- Bouazizi's protest that sparked revolution\n- Whistleblowers risking careers for truth\n- Communities choosing dignity over safety\n- Artists living in poverty for their work\n\nThese happen when humans recognize something more fundamental than survival and act from that recognition.\n\nThe difference is crucial: One pattern shows what happens when systems deny our capacity for meaning, treating humans as units to be managed. The other shows what's possible when we recognize meaning as more fundamental than survival itself.\n\nThis reveals something profound about human nature: We need more than safety and comfort to truly live. We need the possibility of touching meaning so real it would be worth dying for. Not because we seek death, but because meaning itself is more fundamental than physical survival.\n\nConsider how this plays out in social impact work:\n- Aid systems that provide safety while crushing dignity\n- Development metrics that improve while communities die\n- Impact measurements that miss what makes life worth living\n\nThe tragedy isn't just that these systems fail - it's that they succeed at their metrics while failing at meaning. They create the very despair they claim to address.\n\nWhat if instead of designing systems to maximize safety and minimize risk, we designed them to maximize meaningful choice? What if instead of measuring success through metrics, we measured it by whether people can access the kind of meaning worth sacrificing for?\n\nThis isn't about romanticizing sacrifice or ignoring practical needs. It's about recognizing that humans need the possibility of meaningful sacrifice more fundamentally than they need safety. We need to know our lives could touch something worth dying for, even if we never face that choice.\n\nWhen systems deny this - when they make safety and metrics primary - they create the conditions for despair. When they honor it - when they recognize meaning as fundamental - they create conditions where both safety and flourishing become possible.\n\nThe question for social impact isn't just \"How do we help people survive?\" but \"How do we create conditions where life is worth living?\" Not just \"How do we measure impact?\" but \"How do we honor the meaning that makes metrics meaningful?\"\n\nThis requires a fundamental shift in how we see human nature and purpose. Not as creatures needing management and control, but as beings capable of recognizing and acting from meaning more fundamental than survival itself.",

              "content": "# The Birthright We Forgot: Recovering Our Capacity to See\n\nOn September 26, 1983, Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov faced a choice that would determine the fate of humanity. His early warning systems showed five nuclear missiles heading toward the Soviet Union. Protocol required immediate retaliation. Every metric, every system, every rational analysis said: Launch.\n\nBut something deeper than rationality made him hesitate. A quality he sensed but couldn't quantify told him something wasn't right. He chose to trust this perception over his instruments. We now know the warning system had malfunctioned - Petrov's choice to trust his deeper knowing quite literally saved humanity.\n\nThis capacity - to recognize quality and meaning directly - isn't new. It's our birthright, as ancient as humanity itself. Archaeological evidence shows early human communities investing enormous resources to care for injured members who couldn't contribute materially. Indigenous cultures worldwide developed sophisticated systems based on gift and reciprocity rather than pure calculation. In traditional villages, caring for neighbors wasn't charity - it was simply what it meant to be human.\n\nWhat's new isn't the capacity itself but our systematic forgetting of it. We've created a world where \"just the facts\" trumps felt knowing, where \"show me the numbers\" dismisses direct perception of quality. We've built cities where we're more connected to strangers through social media than to our next-door neighbors, where artists starve while metrics thrive.\n\nThe Science of Seeing:\nResearch increasingly validates this forgotten faculty:\n- Studies show humans naturally recognize patterns too complex to analyze rationally\n- Neural research reveals we process meaning before conscious thought\n- Social science demonstrates how gift economies created more stable societies than pure markets\n- Anthropology shows cultures worldwide developed sophisticated practices for cultivating this perception\n[Note: We should verify specific studies]\n\nThis isn't mystical or anti-rational. It's a practical capacity for recognizing quality directly, like how we know a friend is truly sad despite their smile, or how a master craftsperson knows exactly how much pressure to apply. It's the difference between measuring music and hearing it.\n\nContemporary Examples:\n- Doctors who sense when standard protocols miss something crucial\n- Teachers who recognize a student's potential beyond test scores\n- Communities that maintain human connection despite systemic pressures\n- Leaders who choose meaning over metrics even at personal cost\n\nThe cost of forgetting this faculty shows up everywhere:\n- Mental health crises despite improving living standards\n- Environmental collapse despite better measurements\n- Social isolation despite more connectivity\n- Work without meaning despite higher productivity\n\nYet this capacity remains, waiting to be recovered. Every time we recognize beauty without analysis, every time we know something is right without calculation, we touch this birthright.\n\nThe challenge isn't learning something new but remembering something fundamental:\n- Not just measuring care but creating conditions where it emerges naturally\n- Not just incentivizing cooperation but removing what blocks it\n- Not just analyzing quality but recovering our capacity to recognize it directly\n\nThis has profound implications for how we design systems:\n- What if we built organizations that trusted this knowing alongside metrics?\n- What if we created cities that enabled rather than blocked natural human connection?\n- What if we developed technologies that enhanced rather than replaced this perception?\n\nWe don't need to choose between rational analysis and direct perception of quality. Like stereoscopic vision, we need both to see depth. What we need is to remember this forgotten faculty, to trust it alongside our capacity for measurement and analysis.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. Like Petrov, we face choices where metrics alone can't guide us. Climate change, artificial intelligence, social collapse - these challenges require both precise measurement and deep recognition of quality. We need our full human capacity for knowing what matters.",

              "content": "# The Science of Seeing Quality\n\nWe're taught to distrust anything that can't be measured. \"Show me the numbers,\" we say. \"Just the facts.\" Yet science increasingly reveals that our capacity to recognize quality directly isn't mystical - it's a sophisticated form of intelligence our ancestors relied on and modern life has caused us to forget.\n\nConsider three kinds of evidence:\n\nThe Science:\nNeural research shows our brains process meaning before conscious analysis. When master craftspeople know exactly how much pressure to apply, or experienced doctors sense something's wrong despite normal tests, they're not guessing - they're using pattern recognition systems more sophisticated than conscious reasoning. [Note: Need specific studies]\n\nThe History:\nArchaeological evidence shows early humans caring for injured members who couldn't contribute materially. Indigenous cultures worldwide developed gift economies and care practices that created more stable societies than pure transaction. In traditional villages, knowing your neighbors and caring for them wasn't charity - it was simply what it meant to be human.\n\nThe Stakes:\nIn 1983, when Soviet systems showed five nuclear missiles incoming, every metric told Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov to launch a counter-strike. Instead, he trusted a deeper knowing that something wasn't right. The warning system had malfunctioned - his choice to trust quality recognition over pure metrics literally saved humanity.\n\nToday we face similar stakes. Climate change, AI, social collapse - these challenges require both precise measurement and deep recognition of quality. Yet we've created a world that systematically blocks this faculty:\n- Urban designs that prevent natural community\n- Social media replacing direct human connection\n- Metrics systems that miss what matters most\n- Economic models that treat relationship as inefficient\n\nThe tragedy isn't just that we've forgotten this capacity - it's that we've built systems that actively suppress it. We connect with strangers worldwide through curated images while never speaking to our neighbors. We measure everything while recognizing less and less.\n\nYet this faculty remains our birthright. Every time we recognize beauty without analysis, every time we know something's right without calculation, we touch this ancient capacity. The challenge isn't learning something new but remembering something fundamental to being human.",

And if you could write maybe 5 really great examples and dig in a little. Into them about maybe some of the principal some of the facts. Some of the things that relate to some of the science that we've been looking at and the philosophy we've been thinking about. And making it applied and go really deep, you know, like, Get me 5 excellent examples and show how it relates to this idea of quality and perception, as a those 2. What makes sense. And Then we'll do 5 negative examples. And then I'll also answer your questions. I'm not sure how to order them. Can you tell me? Just give me a good idea of an order that imagine somebody that is in the social impact world Feels like have work with funders in a certain way because that's what funders are looking for and so they need to get these metrics Android order to survive. And it's like, a strategic rather than a heartfelt iOS I'm not sure. Maybe we can call this, like, the death of strategy or something and, like, why strategy is killing you? Don't know. Something like that. Yeah. Trusting the faculty to learning to access it. I'm still learning to access it. And I've actually, just now, trying more and more to really lean into it and and even to stop doing things that don't make me come alive at work and Android% trust who I am. Rather than who I want to be or wish I was, for instance. Like, you know, like, I sometimes think, like, maybe I should have apply to some tech jobs so I can make a bunch of money because my family needs And these days, I'm thinking, no. Like, I have something here. In this that keeps this question that burns within me that I ask and I wonder and I feel and I wanna write poetry and drawn It seems important. But was it to be able to feed my family? Will I be able to survive in this world? There's attention. I'm not sure. And maybe it maybe I do need some to keep me alive. I've been thinking like it a simple job. Uses my hands, but keeps my mind free. Something that will pay me less. It gives me life. Not a desk job. Something that uses my body, maybe. Something that is with people, a contribution. Something that's more humble, something that never really helps me come alive. I gotta see. Yeah. Recommendations and changes in social impact work. Getting closer people. That you work with. That having instead of, like, dashboards a narrative story about who we are as an organization, and what the world is that we see What we've Believe in it makes us feel and what we think we should do about it. And having that be like a collaboratively edited document that helps everyone get on the same page. You know, like, it might have some graphs Like, what I see is, like, people aren't really connecting with our social media. I feel like there's something weird here. Know? We need a way to be able to get what we want to do and feel, like, Inspired. Do and align around doing to touch that part of us that knows what to do and how to do it or might even just have doubts And Focus less on The tools. You know, and build tools only when we have to. Only when we get to that point where we're like, we can't not build this thing. We really shown that we you know, we're doing everything with manual calling people and connecting them and figuring out and, like, we can't remember everyone's details, and so we need to get This feedback form. But only when we have to. 2 Work on what's next. Instead of what has passed. And to have people pay for our services. And to have the customer be the person receiving the value. And our work for the people that can't afford it. To come from our charity. From the profit Yeah. I think it helps in 2 ways in the contemporary crisis. 1 is it helps people protect themselves in a sense and connect more with what matters and less with this polarized world and kind of, like, step back accelerating cycle of tension and conflict And also, 2 increase contentedness. Reducing consumption because people have a sense of meaning in life. Increasing The jobs that people do that make sense that they're connected to and connected to community through rather than what can I do to make money by blasting the world with fake AI images? That market something for me. And this idea will make clearer that AI. Cannot access the faculty of perception of quality. And that humans are required we can't build a camera. And that modality to our systems. And that we can kind of infer it. From Text. But we can never add what should we do now Because the now perception can't be brought into the machines.

And if you could write maybe 5 really great examples and dig in a little. Into them about maybe some of the principal some of the facts. Some of the things that relate to some of the science that we've been looking at and the philosophy we've been thinking about. And making it applied and go really deep, you know, like, Get me 5 excellent examples and show how it relates to this idea of quality and perception, as a those 2. What makes sense. And Then we'll do 5 negative examples. And then I'll also answer your questions. I'm not sure how to order them. Can you tell me? Just give me a good idea of an order that imagine somebody that is in the social impact world Feels like have work with funders in a certain way because that's what funders are looking for and so they need to get these metrics Android order to survive. And it's like, a strategic rather than a heartfelt iOS I'm not sure. Maybe we can call this, like, the death of strategy or something and, like, why strategy is killing you? Don't know. Something like that. Yeah. Trusting the faculty to learning to access it. I'm still learning to access it. And I've actually, just now, trying more and more to really lean into it and and even to stop doing things that don't make me come alive at work and Android% trust who I am. Rather than who I want to be or wish I was, for instance. Like, you know, like, I sometimes think, like, maybe I should have apply to some tech jobs so I can make a bunch of money because my family needs And these days, I'm thinking, no. Like, I have something here. In this that keeps this question that burns within me that I ask and I wonder and I feel and I wanna write poetry and drawn It seems important. But was it to be able to feed my family? Will I be able to survive in this world? There's attention. I'm not sure. And maybe it maybe I do need some to keep me alive. I've been thinking like it a simple job. Uses my hands, but keeps my mind free. Something that will pay me less. It gives me life. Not a desk job. Something that uses my body, maybe. Something that is with people, a contribution. Something that's more humble, something that never really helps me come alive. I gotta see. Yeah. Recommendations and changes in social impact work. Getting closer people. That you work with. That having instead of, like, dashboards a narrative story about who we are as an organization, and what the world is that we see What we've Believe in it makes us feel and what we think we should do about it. And having that be like a collaboratively edited document that helps everyone get on the same page. You know, like, it might have some graphs Like, what I see is, like, people aren't really connecting with our social media. I feel like there's something weird here. Know? We need a way to be able to get what we want to do and feel, like, Inspired. Do and align around doing to touch that part of us that knows what to do and how to do it or might even just have doubts And Focus less on The tools. You know, and build tools only when we have to. Only when we get to that point where we're like, we can't not build this thing. We really shown that we you know, we're doing everything with manual calling people and connecting them and figuring out and, like, we can't remember everyone's details, and so we need to get This feedback form. But only when we have to. 2 Work on what's next. Instead of what has passed. And to have people pay for our services. And to have the customer be the person receiving the value. And our work for the people that can't afford it. To come from our charity. From the profit Yeah. I think it helps in 2 ways in the contemporary crisis. 1 is it helps people protect themselves in a sense and connect more with what matters and less with this polarized world and kind of, like, step back accelerating cycle of tension and conflict And also, 2 increase contentedness. Reducing consumption because people have a sense of meaning in life. Increasing The jobs that people do that make sense that they're connected to and connected to community through rather than what can I do to make money by blasting the world with fake AI images? That market something for me. And this idea will make clearer that AI. Cannot access the faculty of perception of quality. And that humans are required we can't build a camera. And that modality to our systems. And that we can kind of infer it. From Text. But we can never add what should we do now Because the now perception can't be brought into the machines.

Buurtzorg (Netherlands)\nWhat They Did:\n- Eliminated all middle management and metrics-based control\n- Trusted nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs\n- Organized in small, self-managing teams connected to local communities\n\nResults:\n- Better patient outcomes despite less \"efficiency\"\n- 40% lower costs than competitors\n- Highest healthcare worker satisfaction in Netherlands\n- Spread to 25 countries without traditional scaling strategy\n\nKey Insight: When you trust people's direct perception of what's needed, both meaning and metrics improve naturally.\n\n2. Mondragón Cooperative Corporation (Spain)\nWhat They Did:\n- Built world's largest worker cooperative based on dignity not profit\n- During 2008 crisis, chose reduced hours for all over layoffs\n- Decisions made through direct relationship, not abstract metrics\n- Pay ratio maximum 6:1 between highest/lowest paid\n\nResults:\n- 81,000 workers\n- More stable than traditional corporations\n- Higher innovation despite lower R&D spending\n- Workers report higher meaning/purpose\n\nKey Insight: Prioritizing human dignity over efficiency paradoxically creates more robust organizations.\n\n3. Patagonia\nWhat They Did:\n- Let employees go surfing when waves are good\n- Actively discourages consumption (\"Don't Buy This Jacket\" campaign)\n- Decisions based on environmental impact not just profit\n- Recently gave company away to environmental trust\n\nResults:\n- $1.5B revenue while maintaining values\n- Industry-leading employee retention\n- Pioneered many environmental practices\n- Proves profit possible without maximizing it\n\nKey Insight: When organizations align with deeper values, they attract people who create success differently.\n\n4. Greyston Bakery\nWhat They Did:\n- Pioneered \"open hiring\" - no interviews, no questions asked\n- Anyone who wants work can sign up\n- Trust people's capacity to contribute meaningful work\n- Focus on human development not just production\n\nResults:\n- Major supplier to Ben & Jerry's\n- Lower turnover than industry average\n- Workers develop careers, not just jobs\n- Model being adopted by other companies\n\nKey Insight: Removing metrics-based filters allows human potential to emerge naturally.\n\n5. Barry-Wehmiller\nWhat They Did:\n- Manufacturing company that treats people like family\n- During 2008 recession, CEO Bob Chapman refused layoffs\n- Everyone took 4-week furlough, starting with executives\n- Focused on meaning/dignity over short-term profits\n\nResults:\n- Emerged stronger from recession\n- Industry-leading retention\n- $3B revenue through organic growth\n- Workers report high meaning/purpose\n\nKey Insight: When organizations truly prioritize human dignity, both meaning and profit become possible.\n\nCommon Patterns:\n1. Trust in human capacity to recognize quality directly\n2. Prioritize relationship over abstract metrics\n3. Allow emergence rather than forcing outcomes\n4. Focus on meaning first, letting metrics follow\n5. Build from human dignity rather than efficiency\n\nThese organizations don't just \"balance\" metrics and meaning - they show what's possible when we trust our faculty for recognizing quality directly. They're not perfect, but they point toward a different way of organizing human activity.",

Interface (Ray Anderson's Transformation)\nMindset/Values:\n- CEO had environmental awakening reading \"The Ecology of Commerce\"\n- Shifted from seeing business as extraction to regeneration\n- Developed \"Mission Zero\" - zero environmental impact\n- Trusted employees to innovate solutions from meaning, not metrics\n\nWhat They Did:\n- Completely redesigned carpet manufacturing\n- Let employees experiment with radical solutions\n- Shared environmental innovations with competitors\n- Focused on \"climbing Mount Sustainability\" not just profit\n\nResults:\n- Reduced environmental impact by 96%\n- Became more profitable through efficiency\n- Inspired entire industry to change\n- Created new markets through innovation\n\nKey Insight: When leadership trusts deeper perception of what's needed, impossible transformations become possible.\n\n2. Sounds True (Tami Simon)\nMindset/Values:\n- Founded on principle that wisdom deserves good production values\n- Decisions made through \"felt sense\" of what's important\n- Trust in both business acumen and spiritual wisdom\n- Focus on authenticity in all relationships\n\nWhat They Did:\n- Publishers reject spirituality books for being too niche\n- Built direct relationships with authors and customers\n- Created new publishing model based on integrity\n- Maintained independence to preserve values\n\nResults:\n- Built $60M multimedia publishing company\n- Industry-leading author relationships\n- Pioneer in audio publishing\n- Proves spiritual values can drive business success\n\nKey Insight: When organizations trust deeper knowing alongside business sense, new models emerge.\n\n3. Eileen Fisher\nMindset/Values:\n- \"Business as a movement\" philosophy\n- Decisions based on what feels right, not just metrics\n- Focus on women's empowerment through clothes and work\n- Environmental responsibility as core value\n\nWhat They Did:\n- Became B-Corp before it was common\n- Created circular economy for clothes\n- Employee ownership program\n- Prioritizes simplicity and timelessness over fashion\n\nResults:\n- $400M+ revenue\n- Industry leader in sustainability\n- High employee engagement\n- Proves fashion can be ethical\n\nKey Insight: Following what \"feels right\" can create more sustainable business than following trends.\n\n4. Equal Exchange\nMindset/Values:\n- Worker-owned cooperative in fair trade\n- Democratic principles in business\n- Trust in direct relationships over certification\n- Focus on long-term transformation not short-term profit\n\nWhat They Did:\n- Built direct relationships with farmer cooperatives\n- Created alternative to traditional fair trade certification\n- Shared ownership with workers\n- Maintained independence through creative financing\n\nResults:\n- $80M+ in revenue\n- Industry-leading farmer relationships\n- Pioneer in fair trade movement\n- Proves democratic business can scale\n\nKey Insight: When organizations trust relationships over metrics, new trade models become possible.\n\n5. Basecamp (formerly 37signals)\nMindset/Values:\n- \"It doesn't have to be crazy at work\" philosophy\n- Trust in simplicity over complexity\n- Focus on quality of work life\n- Decisions based on human needs not industry norms\n\nWhat They Did:\n- 32-hour summer workweeks\n- No tracking of employee time\n- Eliminated unnecessary meetings\n- Banned political discussions at work\n\nResults:\n- Profitable with small team\n- Industry-leading products\n- High employee retention\n- Proves calm companies can succeed\n\nKey Insight: When organizations trust human capacity for quality work, they don't need complex control systems.\n\nCommon Patterns Across All Ten Organizations:\n\nMindset Elements:\n1. Trust in direct perception of what's needed\n2. Comfort with emergence over control\n3. Long-term view of success\n4. Integration of multiple ways of knowing\n5. Focus on human dignity and potential\n\nValue Foundations:\n1. Belief in human capacity for wisdom\n2. Trust in relationship over abstraction\n3. Recognition of multiple bottom lines\n4. Commitment to independence\n5. Comfort with paradox\n\nWhat Makes This Possible:\n- Leaders who trust their own quality recognition\n- Cultures that support multiple ways of knowing\n- Independence from external control (private ownership, cooperative structure)\n- Focus on building capacity not just measuring output\n- Recognition that meaning drives real success\n\nThese organizations show that trusting our faculty for recognizing quality isn't just idealistic - it creates more resilient, successful organizations. They're not perfect, but they point toward what's possible when we trust deeper ways of knowing.",

Semco (Brazil)\nMindset/Values:\n- Radical democracy in workplace\n- \"Managing without managers\"\n- Trust over control\n- Worker autonomy taken to extreme\n\nWhat They Did:\n- Let workers set their own salaries\n- Eliminated most rules and policies\n- Workers choose their leaders\n- Complete transparency of finances\n- Six-month rotating leadership positions\n\nResults:\n- Grew from $4M to $212M in revenue\n- Survived multiple Brazilian economic crises\n- Near-zero turnover\n- Inspired global democratic workplace movement\n\nKey Insight: When you truly trust workers' capacity to recognize what's needed, traditional management becomes unnecessary.\n\n2. Enspiral (New Zealand)\nMindset/Values:\n- \"Network of purpose-driven entrepreneurs\"\n- No central control\n- Trust in collective intelligence\n- Focus on social impact through technology\n\nWhat They Did:\n- Created decentralized decision-making software (Loomio)\n- Collective ownership of resources\n- Transparent budgeting through cobudget tool\n- Members choose their own work and commitments\n\nResults:\n- Spawned multiple successful social enterprises\n- Pioneered new forms of collective organization\n- Created open-source tools used globally\n- Proves decentralized organizations can work\n\nKey Insight: When organizations trust emergence, technology can enhance rather than replace human wisdom.\n\n3. Nearsoft (Mexico)\nMindset/Values:\n- \"People-first\" software development\n- Complete transparency\n- Self-management\n- Focus on personal growth\n\nWhat They Did:\n- No HR department\n- Open books management\n- Self-set salaries\n- Learning-focused culture\n- Employees choose their projects\n\nResults:\n- High-quality software development\n- Industry-leading retention\n- Organic growth without external funding\n- Shows alternative to Silicon Valley model\n\nKey Insight: When tech companies trust people over process, both quality and happiness improve.\n\n4. Morning Star (USA)\nMindset/Values:\n- World's largest tomato processor\n- No supervisors or managers\n- \"Commercial mission\" drives decisions\n- Trust in direct relationships\n\nWhat They Did:\n- Workers negotiate responsibilities with colleagues\n- Everyone can spend company money\n- Peer-based compensation setting\n- Decisions through natural conflict resolution\n\nResults:\n- Industry leader in efficiency\n- Very low turnover\n- High innovation rate\n- Proves self-management works at scale\n\nKey Insight: Even in traditional industries, trusting workers' direct perception creates better results than control.\n\n5. Haier (China)\nMindset/Values:\n- \"RenDanHeYi\" model (human value optimization)\n- Autonomous microenterprises\n- Zero distance to customer\n- Everyone is their own CEO\n\nWhat They Did:\n- Broke 80,000 person company into 4,000 microenterprises\n- Eliminated middle management\n- Direct user relationships\n- Internal market system\n- Innovation driven by front-line workers\n\nResults:\n- World's largest appliance manufacturer\n- Industry-leading innovation\n- High employee engagement\n- Shows alternative to traditional Chinese management\n\nKey Insight: Even massive companies can organize around human quality recognition rather than control.\n\nCommon Patterns in Technology/Work Innovation:\n\n1. Trust Enables Technology:\n- Tech serves human connection rather than replacing it\n- Tools enhance rather than control\n- Innovation emerges from trust not force\n\n2. Structure Follows Values:\n- Organizational forms emerge from trust\n- Technology supports rather than drives change\n- Human relationships remain central\n\n3. Quality Over Control:\n- High performance through freedom\n- Natural accountability works better than imposed\n- Trust reduces need for supervision\n\n4. Cultural Adaptation:\n- Each organization finds its own way\n- Local culture integrated with new forms\n- Proves these principles work across contexts\n\nWhat Makes This Work:\n- Leaders willing to question fundamental assumptions\n- Focus on human capacity over systems\n- Trust in emergence over control\n- Technology serving human quality rather than replacing it\n- Recognition that control creates the problems it tries to solve\n\nThese examples show that:\n1. This approach works across cultures\n2. Technology can enhance rather than replace human quality recognition\n3. Scale isn't a barrier - it's about fundamental principles\n4. Different cultures find their own ways to apply these principles\n5. Success comes from trusting human capacity more than perfect systems",

              "content": "# Craft as Path to Wholeness: Personal, Social, and Ecological Integration\n\n## The Integration Pattern\n\n1. Personal Integration\n- Craft reconnects mind and body\n- Attention becomes natural not forced\n- Skills development builds inner confidence\n- Quality recognition becomes embodied\n- Work becomes meditation\n\n2. Social Integration\n- Apprenticeship creates real mentorship\n- Knowledge transfers build community\n- Shared craft creates culture\n- Quality recognition becomes collective\n- Breaking bread becomes communion\n\n3. Ecological Integration\n- Material understanding creates care\n- Waste becomes naturally abhorrent\n- Quality reduces consumption\n- Local sourcing emerges naturally\n- Sustainability through relationship\n\n## Beyond Luxury: Craft at Scale\n\nExamples of Accessible Craft:\n\n1. Daily Bread Bakery (Toronto)\n- Industrial-scale artisanal bread\n- Craft methods at volume\n- Accessible pricing through efficiency\n- Quality through process not expense\nResults:\n- Proves craft can feed cities\n- Shows quality possible at scale\n- Makes artisanal accessible\n\n2. Jaipur Rugs (India)\n- 40,000 artisan network\n- Traditional craft at scale\n- Fair wages through direct sales\n- Quality through distributed craft\nResults:\n- Lifted communities from poverty\n- Preserved traditional skills\n- Proved craft can scale\n\n3. East Fork Pottery\n- Production pottery with soul\n- Craft thinking in manufacturing\n- Accessible pricing through volume\n- Quality through process design\nResults:\n- Made craft ceramics accessible\n- Created living wage craft jobs\n- Showed new production model\n\n## The Social Impact Connection\n\nCraft approaches solve multiple problems:\n1. Environmental\n- Reduces waste through quality\n- Creates care for materials\n- Builds repair culture\n- Develops sustainable practices\n\n2. Social\n- Creates meaningful work\n- Builds real community\n- Preserves cultural knowledge\n- Develops human capacity\n\n3. Economic\n- Creates sustainable livelihoods\n- Builds local resilience\n- Reduces dependency\n- Values human contribution\n\n## The Scaling Question\n\nHow Craft Can Feed/Serve the World:\n\n1. Distributed Networks\n- Many small producers\n- Local adaptation\n- Shared knowledge\n- Connected communities\n\n2. Appropriate Technology\n- Tools that enhance craft\n- Technology serving human skill\n- Efficiency through understanding\n- Scale through multiplication\n\n3. Knowledge Transfer\n- Apprenticeship networks\n- Digital craft sharing\n- Community skill building\n- Cultural preservation\n\n4. New Economic Models\n- Direct producer-consumer connection\n- Value based on quality not volume\n- Fair compensation for craft\n- Community-supported production\n\nReal-World Examples of Scale:\n\n1. Cooperative Food Networks\n- Small producers feeding cities\n- Craft agriculture at scale\n- Quality through relationship\n- Sustainable through connection\n\n2. Distributed Manufacturing\n- Local production hubs\n- Craft knowledge sharing\n- Quality through process\n- Scale through network\n\n3. Community Craft Centers\n- Skill development hubs\n- Cultural preservation\n- Economic development\n- Social connection\n\n## The Logic Test\n\nCan Craft Feed/Serve the World?\nEvidence suggests yes, through:\n\n1. Efficiency Through Understanding\n- Craft knowledge reduces waste\n- Quality lasts longer\n- Relationship creates care\n- Understanding creates efficiency\n\n2. Scale Through Network\n- Many small producers\n- Local adaptation\n- Knowledge sharing\n- Community connection\n\n3. Technology as Support\n- Tools enhance craft\n- Systems serve human skill\n- Connection enables distribution\n- Networks enable scale\n\n4. New Economic Models\n- Value quality over volume\n- Direct producer relationships\n- Fair compensation possible\n- Community support systems\n\nThis suggests craft isn't just about luxury products but about:\n- Different way of making\n- Different way of relating\n- Different way of valuing\n- Different way of scaling\n\nThe key might be that craft thinking:\n- Creates natural sustainability\n- Builds real community\n- Develops human capacity\n- Enables appropriate scale\n\nNot everything needs to be fully handmade, but craft thinking can inform how we:\n- Design processes\n- Build relationships\n- Transfer knowledge\n- Create value\n\nThis points toward a different development path where:\n- Quality serves accessibility\n- Skill serves community\n- Understanding serves sustainability\n- Beauty serves life",

Scale Through:\n- Network not hierarchy\n- Distribution not centralization\n- Relationship not transaction\n- Quality not quantity\n\n## Guidelines for Preservation\n\nWhen Considering Changes, Ask:\n\n1. Relationship Questions:\n- Does this maintain direct connections?\n- Does this enable knowledge transfer?\n- Does this support community?\n- Does this preserve culture?\n\n2. Quality Questions:\n- Does this support quality recognition?\n- Does this enable skill development?\n- Does this maintain craft judgment?\n- Does this preserve material understanding?\n\n3. Meaning Questions:\n- Does this create meaningful engagement?\n- Does this enable personal growth?\n- Does this build community?\n- Does this preserve wisdom?\n\n4. Sustainability Questions:\n- Does this support local sourcing?\n- Does this reduce waste?\n- Does this build resilience?\n- Does this maintain ecological connection?\n\n## Example: Meaningful Machine Operation\n\nA machine operator can engage in craft when:\n\n1. They Understand:\n- Whole process deeply\n- Material behavior\n- Quality indicators\n- System relationships\n\n2. They Can:\n- Make quality judgments\n- Solve complex problems\n- Teach others\n- Improve processes\n\n3. They Have:\n- Direct feedback loops\n- Learning opportunities\n- Community connection\n- Meaningful contribution\n\n4. Their Role:\n- Requires craft judgment\n- Enables skill development\n- Creates value\n- Builds understanding\n\nThis suggests automation/scale can preserve meaning when it:\n- Enhances rather than replaces human judgment\n- Creates rather than removes learning opportunities\n- Enables rather than blocks direct relationships\n- Supports rather than undermines local integration\n\nThe key is seeing automation/scale as serving craft rather than replacing it. This requires:\n- Different metrics of success\n- Different design principles\n- Different organizational models\n- Different economic relationships\n\nWhen these principles guide development, meaningful work remains possible even with technology and scale.",

Abstract Quality Recognition\nPROS:\n- Gets at fundamental human capacity\n- Connects to deeper meaning\n- Universal across contexts\n- Points to human potential\n\nCONS:\n- Might seem too abstract\n- Harder to implement\n- Could feel disconnected\n- Might lose people\n\n2. Craft-Centered Vision\nPROS:\n- More tangible/relatable\n- Built-in practices/examples\n- Clear historical precedent\n- Natural connection to meaning\n\nCONS:\n- Might seem limited to physical making\n- Could feel backward-looking\n- Might miss some aspects\n- Could seem unrealistic at scale\n\n3. Traditional Impact Framework\nPROS:\n- Well understood\n- Easier to measure\n- Existing infrastructure\n- Clear funding paths\n\nCONS:\n- Misses deeper meaning\n- Often creates wrong incentives\n- Can feel mechanical\n- Often loses soul\n\n## Why Craft Could Be Perfect Framework\n\n1. Natural Integration of:\n- Personal meaning\n- Social connection\n- Environmental care\n- Economic viability\n\n2. Built-in Solutions to:\n- Alienation\n- Waste\n- Community breakdown\n- Environmental degradation\n\n3. Clear Path Forward:\n- Existing examples\n- Proven practices\n- Scalable models\n- Practical steps\n\n## New Metrics for Craft-Based Enterprise\n\n1. Relationship Metrics:\n- Direct customer relationships\n- Knowledge transfer completeness\n- Community integration\n- Cultural preservation\n\n2. Quality Metrics:\n- Product lifespan\n- Repair frequency\n- Material understanding\n- Skill development\n\n3. Meaning Metrics:\n- Worker engagement\n- Skill progression\n- Creative contribution\n- Personal growth\n\n4. Sustainability Metrics:\n- Local sourcing percentage\n- Waste reduction\n- Resource stewardship\n- Ecological integration\n\n## New Design Principles\n\n1. Human Enhancement:\n- Technology serves craft\n- Automation preserves meaning\n- Tools enable relationship\n- Systems support learning\n\n2. Quality Recognition:\n- Direct feedback loops\n- Material understanding\n- Skill development\n- Craft judgment\n\n3. Local Integration:\n- Community connection\n- Cultural relevance\n- Resource stewardship\n- Direct relationships\n\n## New Organizational Models\n\n1. Distributed Networks:\n- Local production hubs\n- Knowledge sharing systems\n- Direct relationships\n- Community integration\n\n2. Learning Organizations:\n- Apprenticeship systems\n- Skill development paths\n- Quality recognition training\n- Wisdom transfer\n\n3. Community Integration:\n- Local sourcing\n- Cultural connection\n- Direct relationships\n- Shared meaning\n\n## New Economic Relationships\n\n1. Direct Value Capture:\n- Producer-consumer connection\n- Fair compensation\n- Skill valuation\n- Community wealth\n\n2. Quality-Based Pricing:\n- Value reflects meaning\n- Durability premium\n- Skill recognition\n- Relationship value\n\n3. Community Support:\n- Local investment\n- Shared resources\n- Cultural preservation\n- Economic resilience\n\n## Implications for Accelerators/Incubators\n\nA Craft-Centered Accelerator Would:\n\n1. Focus on:\n- Quality recognition development\n- Relationship building\n- Skill mastery\n- Community integration\n\n2. Measure:\n- Meaningful engagement\n- Knowledge transfer\n- Direct relationships\n- Local integration\n\n3. Support:\n- Craft development\n- Quality recognition\n- Community building\n- Wisdom transfer\n\n4. Value:\n- Meaningful contribution\n- Skill development\n- Relationship building\n- Cultural preservation\n\nThis Could Transform:\n- How we support enterprises\n- What we consider success\n- How we measure impact\n- What we value in business\n\nThe key might be that craft provides:\n- Clear principles while remaining flexible\n- Tangible examples while pointing to deeper meaning\n- Practical steps while maintaining vision\n- Proven models while enabling innovation\n\nThis suggests craft could be:\n- Perfect middle ground between abstract and practical\n- Natural framework for new economy\n- Clear guide for enterprise development\n- Path to meaningful scale\n\nRather than talking about sustainability/impact directly, craft naturally creates:\n- Environmental care through material relationship\n- Social impact through community integration\n- Economic viability through quality value\n- Personal meaning through engagement\n\nThis might be exactly the framework needed for:\n- New enterprise development\n- Economic transformation\n- Meaningful scale\n- Sustainable future",

Let's let's think deeply, broadly across cultures, Let's create tables to kind of look at the different factors and which ones overlap and which ones don't overlap and you know, about the quality perception and relation know, craft has that element of choiceless action kind of where, like, you're emerging, that you're also kind of in the zone and that there's continual learning and refinement progression and mastery and meaning and command and you have something to offer of tangible value when you're sharing it and you kind of know who you are and how you fit in and, you relate you relate to objects and you relate to people differently. Because of that. Right? And it's like, let's say that, you know, Minecraft is the speaking. Sure someone else could say it, but I can be proud for the uniqueness in the way that I say it. And something about, like, you know, you copy things until you become a master. And then once you're a master, then you can innovate rather than like people disrupting things when they're young and they don't actually know the principles in the foundation because like, the how of doing things informs the the why, and it comes together in, like, this kind of harmonious way. And know, this whole idea of kind of undoing lot of this industrialization and the way of thinking of people as ends kind of gets addressed in a the ductive, you know? And it's, it's It's it might not be the only way to describe it, and I'm curious if there are better ways and if you have any ideas.",

Let's let's think deeply, broadly across cultures, Let's create tables to kind of look at the different factors and which ones overlap and which ones don't overlap and you know, about the quality perception and relation know, craft has that element of choiceless action kind of where, like, you're emerging, that you're also kind of in the zone and that there's continual learning and refinement progression and mastery and meaning and command and you have something to offer of tangible value when you're sharing it and you kind of know who you are and how you fit in and, you relate you relate to objects and you relate to people differently.

Integration Elements:\n- Self with work\n- Mind with body\n- Individual with community\n- Human with material\n- Knowledge with practice\n\n2. Development Pattern:\n- Natural progression\n- Embodied learning\n- Quality recognition\n- Wisdom transmission\n- Choiceless action\n\n3. Relationship Aspects:\n- Master-apprentice bonds\n- Community belonging\n- Material connection\n- Direct transmission\n- Cultural continuity\n\n4. Quality Recognition:\n- Beauty perception\n- Excellence recognition\n- Natural judgment\n- Intrinsic standards\n- Direct knowing\n\n## Alternative Frameworks/Terms:\n\n1. Traditional Wisdom Paths:\n- Japanese \"Do\" (Way) - Tea-do, Ken-do\n- Chinese \"Tao\" (Path)\n- Islamic \"Adab\" (Cultivation)\n- Greek \"Techne\" (Art/Skill)\n- Sanskrit \"Sadhana\" (Practice)\n\nCOMMON ELEMENTS:\n- Integration of being/doing\n- Progressive development\n- Direct transmission\n- Quality recognition\n- Community embedding\n\n2. Contemporary Frameworks:\n- Practice (as in \"practice-based\")\n- Mastery-oriented development\n- Wisdom-based enterprise\n- Quality-centered work\n- Integral business\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- More modern language\n- Broader application\n- Less physical connotation\n- Clear development path\n\n3. Alternative Concepts:\n- Living Work (emphasizes aliveness)\n- Integral Practice (emphasizes wholeness)\n- Wisdom Enterprise (emphasizes knowledge)\n- Quality-Based Development (emphasizes recognition)\n- Natural Business (emphasizes organic growth)\n\n## Comparison Table:\n\nQuality | Craft | Practice | Way | Wisdom Path\n--------|--------|----------|-----|-------------\nIntegration | Yes | Partial | Yes | Yes\nTransmission | Direct | Various | Direct | Direct\nDevelopment | Natural | Structured | Natural | Natural\nCommunity | Essential | Optional | Essential | Essential\nQuality Recognition | Central | Partial | Central | Central\nMaterial Connection | Strong | Varies | Various | Various\nScalability | Limited | Good | Limited | Moderate\nModern Relevance | Mixed | High | Mixed | Mixed\n\n## What We're Really Describing:\n\nA way of working/being that:\n1. Integrates rather than separates\n2. Develops through direct transmission\n3. Recognizes quality naturally\n4. Builds real community\n5. Creates lasting value\n6. Enables natural growth\n7. Maintains cultural wisdom\n\n## Possible New Terms:\n\n1. \"Living Work\"\nCAPTURES:\n- Natural development\n- Integration of elements\n- Quality recognition\n- Community connection\n\n2. \"Wisdom Enterprise\"\nCAPTURES:\n- Knowledge transmission\n- Quality recognition\n- Development path\n- Cultural preservation\n\n3. \"Quality Practice\"\nCAPTURES:\n- Direct recognition\n- Progressive development\n- Natural standards\n- Continuous improvement\n\n4. \"Integral Business\"\nCAPTURES:\n- Complete integration\n- Natural development\n- Community connection\n- Lasting value\n\n## Recommendation:\n\nConsider using multiple terms depending on context:\n1. For traditional audiences: \"Craft-based\"\n2. For business: \"Quality-centered\"\n3. For development: \"Practice-based\"\n4. For philosophy: \"Integral approach\"\n\nThe key is emphasizing:\n- Integration over separation\n- Development over control\n- Quality over metrics\n- Community over scale\n- Wisdom over information\n\nThis might suggest starting letters/communications by:\n1. Acknowledging limitations of current terms\n2. Describing what we're pointing toward\n3. Using multiple frameworks as needed\n4. Emphasizing core elements over terminology\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Explore any of these frameworks further?\n2. Develop specific language for different contexts?\n3. Start drafting the letter with this understanding?",

Development Pattern:\n- Copy before innovation\n- Embodied not just mental learning\n- Progressive mastery\n- Foundation before creativity\n- Natural unfolding\n\n3. Relational Elements:\n- Master-apprentice transmission\n- Community embedding\n- Cultural continuity\n- Direct relationship\n- Living wisdom\n\n4. Quality Recognition:\n- Natural judgment\n- Beauty perception\n- Truth recognition\n- Direct knowing\n- Wisdom embodiment\n\n## Cultural Terms/Concepts That Might Better Capture This:\n\n1. Japanese Concepts:\nDO (道) - \"The Way\"\n- Integration of practice/being\n- Progressive mastery\n- Direct transmission\n- Natural emergence\n\nKEIKO (稽古) - \"Practice\"\n- Embodied learning\n- Repetition with awareness\n- Foundation building\n- Quality recognition\n\n2. Islamic Concepts:\nIHSAN (إحسان) - \"Excellence\"\n- Beauty in action\n- Direct witnessing\n- Quality recognition\n- Natural emergence\n\nADAB (أدب) - \"Cultivation\"\n- Complete development\n- Wisdom transmission\n- Cultural continuity\n- Inner/outer alignment\n\n3. Chinese Concepts:\nTAO (道) - \"The Way\"\n- Natural unfolding\n- Integration of being/doing\n- Direct recognition\n- Wisdom embodiment\n\nGONGFU (功夫) - \"Skilled Work\"\n- Deep practice\n- Progressive mastery\n- Quality recognition\n- Natural development\n\n4. Indian Concepts:\nSADHANA (साधना) - \"Practice\"\n- Complete development\n- Integration of life\n- Progressive mastery\n- Natural unfolding\n\nRASA (रस) - \"Essence\"\n- Quality recognition\n- Beauty perception\n- Direct knowing\n- Natural judgment\n\n## What These Share That \"Craft\" Misses:\n\n1. Integration Level:\n- Complete life integration\n- Being and doing united\n- Inner and outer aligned\n- Theory and practice merged\n\n2. Development Depth:\n- Whole person transformation\n- Natural progression\n- Foundation building\n- Wisdom emergence\n\n3. Transmission Quality:\n- Direct heart-to-heart\n- Living wisdom\n- Cultural continuity\n- Real relationship\n\n4. Recognition Capacity:\n- Quality perception\n- Beauty recognition\n- Truth discernment\n- Natural judgment\n\n## Possible New Framework:\n\nInstead of \"craft-based,\" perhaps something like:\n\n\"Living Practice\" or \"Way-Based Development\" capturing:\n\n1.

              "content": "# From Metrics to Meaning: Reimagining How We Support Social Impact\n\nDear Dara and Munir,\n\nI've been wrestling with something fundamental about our work at Bloom, and I think I'm finally finding language for it. It started becoming clear during our retreat in Dubai, watching our entrepreneurs share their stories. Seeing them come alive, watching tears flow as they shared their deep care for their communities - I realized we were witnessing something our metrics could never capture: the beauty of people fully aligned with their calling.\n\n## What We're Missing\n\nWe've been operating with one eye closed. Like navigating solely by map without looking at the territory, we've prioritized metrics and frameworks over a more fundamental capacity: our ability to recognize quality and meaning directly. This isn't about emotions or intuition - it's about a perceptual faculty as real as sight or hearing, one that lets us recognize what's true, beautiful, and good.\n\nI see this most clearly in how we've sometimes let measurement drive action. Remember when we pushed to get more people on the platform for feedback data? It felt wrong even as we did it, pulling us away from what entrepreneurs really needed. We knew better, but our metrics demanded it.\n\n## What's Possible\n\nBut there's another way. Look at organizations like Buurtzorg in healthcare or Sounds True in publishing. They've built successful enterprises by trusting people's capacity to recognize and create quality. They've shown that when you create conditions for beauty to emerge rather than trying to force specific outcomes, both meaning and metrics improve naturally.\n\nThis isn't just philosophical - it has practical implications for how we work:\n\nFor Our Entrepreneurs:\n- Deep self-knowledge leading to genuine confidence\n- Connection to real mentors and wisdom\n- Understanding their work as craft requiring mastery\n- Natural attraction of resources through authenticity\n\nFor Our Team:\n- Shift from monitoring to gardening\n- Morning focus on understanding/seeing before metrics\n- Deeper presence with teams\n- More meaningful partner relationships\n\nFor Our Partners:\n- Integration with their own sources of meaning\n- Funding flowing to real value\n- Shared recognition of quality\n\n## A Path Forward\n\nI believe we can test this approach through a simple experiment: offering coaching using our \"come alive\" methodology. Start free for a month, then charge as we prove value. We don't need external accreditation - our experience and reputation with entrepreneurs speaks for itself.\n\nThis isn't about abandoning metrics - it's about putting them in proper place. Like a gardener who measures growth but knows you can't force a flower to bloom, we need both eyes open: the eye that sees quality directly and the eye that tracks progress.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe entrepreneurs we serve don't need another accelerator pushing them toward predetermined metrics. They need:\n- Space to recognize their own wisdom\n- Support in developing their craft\n- Community that sees their beauty\n- Tools that serve their growth\n\nWhen we provide this, I've watched them come alive. Not just \"engaged\" or \"productive\" - alive with purpose, clear in direction, magnetic to others. This is what creates lasting impact.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI propose we:\n1. Start small experiments with this approach\n2. Document what we learn\n3. Let evidence guide expansion\n4. Build new frameworks based on real insight\n\nThis isn't a rejection of what we've built - it's an evolution toward what we've always meant to be: a space where social impact emerges naturally from people fully alive in their purpose.\n\nWhat do you think? I'd love to discuss this more deeply.\n\nWith care and hope,\n[Your name]",

      "content": " Thank you for these rich responses. Let me draft Part II of the essay, building on these insights:\n\n# Part II: What's Really Missing - Beyond Metrics to Meaning\n\n## The Tension We All Feel\n\nThe rushing tells us something. When we feel constantly hurried at Bloom, when we push to build software before ensuring it serves real needs, when we chase metrics that don't quite capture what matters - these aren't just operational issues. They're symptoms of a deeper misalignment: trying to achieve meaningful ends through instrumental means.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Rushing/Tension] -->|Signals| B[Instrumental Approach]\n    C[Presence/Flow] -->|Signals| D[Aligned Action]\n    B -->|Creates| E[More Rushing]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Natural Timing]\n    G[Fear/Have to] -->|Drives| B\n    H[Love/Want to] -->|Guides| D\n```\n\n## The Different Quality of Non-Instrumental Action\n\nFather Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries illuminates this distinction perfectly. When asked about his \"impact metrics,\" he offers something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability - it's recognizing that real impact emerges from genuine relationship, not instrumental calculation.\n\nThis shows up in how we feel about our work. When invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera, I felt a deep unease - not because the work wasn't valuable, but because I sensed it wasn't yet flowing from that place of pure recognition and response. The contrast with Father Greg's natural authority was stark: his impact flows from friendship, while I was still caught in metrics and justification.\n\n## The Nature of Quality Recognition\n\nWhat we're missing isn't another framework or better metrics. It's trust in our capacity to recognize quality directly. This isn't intuition or emotion, though these can point us toward it. Rather:\n\n- Emotions and tension often signal blocked meaning\n- \"Have to\" versus \"want to\" reveals instrumental thinking\n- Rushing indicates misaligned action\n- Quality recognition feels like natural rightness\n\n## From Signals to Sources\n\nThe key shift happens when we learn to read these signals not as problems to solve but as pointers toward blocked sources of meaning:\n\n- Tension points to possibilities we're not seeing\n- Fear indicates protection rather than presence\n- Rushing reveals misaligned timing\n- Doubt suggests disconnection from quality\n\nWhen we feel that sliminess of inauthenticity or the tension of forced metrics, we're receiving valuable information. These feelings aren't the truth itself - they're signals pointing toward a truth we already recognize but haven't yet trusted or acted upon.\n\n## The Practice of Presence\n\nDeveloping this capacity requires specific practices:\n1.

            "text": " Thank you for these rich responses. Let me draft Part II of the essay, building on these insights:\n\n# Part II: What's Really Missing - Beyond Metrics to Meaning\n\n## The Tension We All Feel\n\nThe rushing tells us something. When we feel constantly hurried at Bloom, when we push to build software before ensuring it serves real needs, when we chase metrics that don't quite capture what matters - these aren't just operational issues. They're symptoms of a deeper misalignment: trying to achieve meaningful ends through instrumental means.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Rushing/Tension] -->|Signals| B[Instrumental Approach]\n    C[Presence/Flow] -->|Signals| D[Aligned Action]\n    B -->|Creates| E[More Rushing]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Natural Timing]\n    G[Fear/Have to] -->|Drives| B\n    H[Love/Want to] -->|Guides| D\n```\n\n## The Different Quality of Non-Instrumental Action\n\nFather Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries illuminates this distinction perfectly. When asked about his \"impact metrics,\" he offers something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability - it's recognizing that real impact emerges from genuine relationship, not instrumental calculation.\n\nThis shows up in how we feel about our work. When invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera, I felt a deep unease - not because the work wasn't valuable, but because I sensed it wasn't yet flowing from that place of pure recognition and response. The contrast with Father Greg's natural authority was stark: his impact flows from friendship, while I was still caught in metrics and justification.\n\n## The Nature of Quality Recognition\n\nWhat we're missing isn't another framework or better metrics. It's trust in our capacity to recognize quality directly. This isn't intuition or emotion, though these can point us toward it. Rather:\n\n- Emotions and tension often signal blocked meaning\n- \"Have to\" versus \"want to\" reveals instrumental thinking\n- Rushing indicates misaligned action\n- Quality recognition feels like natural rightness\n\n## From Signals to Sources\n\nThe key shift happens when we learn to read these signals not as problems to solve but as pointers toward blocked sources of meaning:\n\n- Tension points to possibilities we're not seeing\n- Fear indicates protection rather than presence\n- Rushing reveals misaligned timing\n- Doubt suggests disconnection from quality\n\nWhen we feel that sliminess of inauthenticity or the tension of forced metrics, we're receiving valuable information. These feelings aren't the truth itself - they're signals pointing toward a truth we already recognize but haven't yet trusted or acted upon.\n\n## The Practice of Presence\n\nDeveloping this capacity requires specific practices:\n1. Slowing down to sense what's really needed\n2. Addressing emotions directly to see what they reveal\n3. Making clear decisions that reduce mental noise\n4. Creating space for quality recognition\n5. Building from authentic relationship\n\nThe result isn't slower work but what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - action that flows naturally from recognition rather than being forced by metrics or fear.\n\n---\n\nTo help develop Part III (Gardens, Craft, and Seeing), I'd like to ask:\n\n1. How does the gardening metaphor specifically help us understand the relationship between control and emergence in social impact work?\n\n2. What aspects of traditional craft practices most clearly illustrate the integration of metrics and meaning you're describing?\n\n3. Can you share specific examples of how this \"smooth is fast\" quality shows up when organizations trust quality recognition?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions before we move to the next section?",

      "content": "The gardening metaphor helps us think about setting the stage and sitting back to witness and be in awe and to be in gratitude and to also have goals. Like, we want tomatoes. Right? We need tomatoes. We're hungry. But to plant the right seeds, right, the analogy of what that seed is, And to, set the right context for that seed, and to Hope for the things that you can't control And to live in that liminal space of hope and fear and concern and aliveness rather than planning and getting to the end of the strategy and the arrogance that comes in thinking that you think that you can figure out how the world works to keep yourself safe, which is not possible and not true. And so gardening, it puts you into that state of present state awareness, being in the now, watching, tending, feeling the water, seeing the soil, seeing the seeds, seeing the predators, seeing the pests and insects, learning to be a part of the system, and to be alive rather than to expect sameness. And if we're not gardeners, we want the world to be up operated more like a factory or like factory farm where we're just expecting inputs and outputs and this idea of control, which stems from this idea that we can't trust people. You know, that we can't trust. The world, we can't trust nature to provide. Right? And that humans are the ones that are gonna figure things out. We're gonna control and master the universe and get what we need out of it. And that's it. That that attitude builds fragility because we're building these systems in opposition to the emergence of nature rather than in harmony with And so gardening lets us build in harmony with And and to be alive and that state of, like, gratitude that comes when your trust and your Confidence that builds when you develop mastery iOS like, you know, I've done this for the last 10 years, 150 years. My family has done this for the last 100 years, 200 years. That yeah, you know, we've been through this before. We've had drought. We've had periods of hunger. But we've also made plans you know, We have an expertise where, you know, maybe we save part of our harvest. We learn to pickle. Know? Some of what we get, we don't eat all of our produce that we harvest every year. In anticipation for those dry years because that is also a part of the cycle, and that kind of history and wisdom and a crude knowledge and story of the world and story of self and gratitude for abundance and acknowledging there are periods of dryness and that we can be patient and that sort of is needed for that moment of abundance and and how beautiful is that? And I think traditional craft practices kind of connect moral relationally, with things, and that relationship is alive. I I know a relation you don't have a relationship. You live a relationship. It's dynamic. It's changing. And this idea of A craft turning material into relationships, turning stuff into a conversation that you have. With the person who holds the pot that you've made or who uses the systems that you're developing or who is experiencing the craft of your music of your performance, of your talk, of your workshop, for instance. All of these things are more relational, and this craft has these different qualities that I think are really important. Right? Like, in craft, You Connects with quality and quantity. You get into presence as you're planning the wood. The movement and the action is measuring as you are sensing, and there's that kind of coming together, this balance, this fulcrum point between the 2. And there's this connection of, like, you learn a craft You know that you don't start innovating when you first learn how to draw, that you like get through the paces. Picasso was really amazing at traditional drawing, and painting before he decided to break the form You have to know the form that you can break. And There's these, elements like Yeah. Connecting with sustainability because you wanna source material and you know what you're using. And it integrates materiality and Addresses alienation and there's a practicality to it. It's also really beautiful. Yeah. There's a different way of making relating. Valuing, scaling, that happens when we think through craft. Quality. There's a big part of craft. And iOS beauty is a big part of craft. The quality and quantity come together in a functional object that is also connected to the the the sense of meaning and and purpose that the crafts person has as they're making it and then imbues it with with physical and psychological and and like, beauty that you can you can sense and that you can engage with. And through attention, all of our different types of work can be a craft. We're connecting to presence and care and meaning. And there's a natural sensibility to sustainability because quality reduces waste, and it connects to traditional wisdom that is ecological and and and handed from the past to the present uses local materials and there's a community connection that creates culture And it's connected to skills and and kind of knowing yourself through what you're making. And craft requires attention. Right? And attention is the thing that is connected to presence into our values. Quality emerges from care and the type of slowness as well that helps us do the right thing. At the right time. And there's knowledge transfer that connects us into relationships with the past and the future. And with material understanding of, like, deep ecological knowledge and sustainable resource use. Smooth is fast. Quality shows up when organizations trust quality recognition. Yeah. That the the the realization that you can't access that recognition if you're rushing And then that recognition is more reliable source of knowing what to do You know? And, like, we've all had that experience of rushing and like, trying to cook dinner and then Like breaking a jar of beans and then taking a longer time to make dinner because you broke the jar of beans. And if we can just not break that jar of beans, and actually just take our time to be more confident and the energy that emerges from that sense of awareness like, the rightness and the ability to convince ourselves and convince others when we can point towards the source of meaning. That's why the idea that meaning has one source is so important because when we tap into that source of meaning, gonna be motivating for us and for others. And you know, by going slow enough to see that, to help others see that, we can go a lot faster because it'll be alignment and different skills from different people will be able to be put to use towards the direction that that beauty is indicating",

Let me draft Part III of the essay, integrating these insights:\n\n# Part III: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing - Natural Models for Social Impact\n\n## The Wisdom of Gardens\n\nWhen we approach social impact like gardeners rather than factory managers, everything changes. A gardener needs tomatoes, yes - there are real outcomes to achieve. But they understand something profound about how change happens: you can't force a seed to grow. You can only create conditions that support its natural unfolding.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Factory Mindset] -->|Attempts| B[Control/Force]\n    C[Garden Mindset] -->|Creates| D[Conditions for Growth]\n    B -->|Results in| E[Fragility]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Natural Resilience]\n    G[Wisdom/Experience] -->|Informs| H[Patient Action]\n    I[Present Awareness] -->|Guides| J[Timely Response]\n```\n\nThis isn't passive - it requires deep engagement:\n- Reading the soil and weather\n- Understanding natural cycles\n- Learning from experience\n- Planning for lean times\n- Responding to challenges\n\nBut it's a different kind of engagement. Instead of attempting to control outcomes through force, we participate in something larger. This creates natural resilience rather than artificial stability.\n\n## The Craft Way of Seeing\n\nCraft offers another crucial model. When a craftsperson works with materials, something remarkable happens: mere stuff becomes relationship. A pot isn't just clay shaped by technique - it's a conversation between maker, material, and eventual user. This transforms how we understand quality and scale:\n\n### Quality Through Relationship\n- Direct material engagement\n- Balance of measurement and feeling\n- Integration of planning and presence\n- Natural sustainability through care\n\n### Learning Through Tradition\n- Mastering form before innovation\n- Knowledge passed through practice\n- Community-held wisdom\n- Deep material understanding\n\n### Natural Scale\n- Quality reduces waste\n- Local materials create resilience\n- Skills build community\n- Beauty spreads naturally\n\n## The Integration of Measurement and Meaning\n\nWhat makes craft particularly relevant for social impact is how it naturally integrates quantitative and qualitative understanding. A craftsperson's movements embody both measurement and sensing - they're not separate activities but aspects of one integrated way of knowing.\n\nThis shows us how metrics and meaning can work together:\n- Quality emerges from careful attention\n- Measurement serves beauty\n- Form enables rather than constrains\n- Tradition guides innovation\n\n## Smooth is Fast: The Paradox of Pace\n\nPerhaps most importantly, craft teaches us about timing. Like the cook who breaks the jar by rushing, we often create delays through forced speed. But when we trust quality recognition:\n- Natural rhythm emerges\n- Right action becomes clear\n- Others align naturally\n- Resources flow appropriately\n\nThis isn't slow for slowness' sake. It's what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - the paradoxical efficiency that comes from aligned action rather than forced effort.\n\n## Implications for Social Impact\n\nThis suggests a different approach to social enterprise:\n- Create conditions rather than force outcomes\n- Build capacity through relationship\n- Let quality guide growth\n- Trust natural timing\n\nWhen we do this:\n- Impact emerges naturally\n- Communities build resilience\n- Resources align with needs\n- Beauty spreads organically\n\nThe key is seeing that, like gardens and craft, social impact isn't something we make happen through force. It's something we participate in through wise attention and aligned action.\n\n---\n\nTo help develop Part IV (Practical Implications for Bloom), I'd like to ask:\n\n1. What specific practices or structures at Bloom would need to change first to embody these principles?\n\n2. How would our relationship with entrepreneurs shift if we approached support more like gardening or craft apprenticeship?\n\n3. What experiments could we run to test these ideas while managing practical constraints?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions before we move to the next section?",

I think we should focus on the elements of the software that we really believe in us are valuable and ignore the rest and just don’t even necessarily try to sell it like focus on the experience. I don’t believe that we’ve made something valuable that just needs to be sold. I think we are now at a point where AI and software development has developed to have made what we have made quite nearly irrelevant, and so it would be to look at our programs and look at our offerings and see who we can serve with who we our true craft what is our craft ? Once we find that I think we can figure out who will find that most valuable start to offer it to them and to kind of just acknowledge like what we really are and what we really have and the assessments I think we can do after the fact, we can use these assessments to help guide and to expose and to help people see, but they shouldn’t be the basis of our program and we shouldn’t try to force people onto these platforms and we shouldn’t try it. I just Everything we do is an instrument to make sure that we make a software platform they can sell because we want to get off of international funding. Let’s just find the thing that we can do that brings in money that is valuable that is clear that is coherent that is powerful and we have things because we can see that people love us people love our programs.

I think we should talk about that together. We should look at what we have to offer and I sort of propose the idea of this framework developing to come alive being a sellable coaching practice for the course of a month and we run maybe the first few as pro bono tests and maybe even do it in partnership with professional coaches to get their kind of accreditation behind us and then from there we can take our lessons learned and sell some seats and that could be our bread and butter paid work - it’s ok that it doesn’t scale - I think it’ll feel real and whole and good and give us insights into what should scale",

I think we should focus on the elements of the software that we really believe in us are valuable and ignore the rest and just don’t even necessarily try to sell it like focus on the experience. I don’t believe that we’ve made something valuable that just needs to be sold. I think we are now at a point where AI and software development has developed to have made what we have made quite nearly irrelevant, and so it would be to look at our programs and look at our offerings and see who we can serve with who we our true craft what is our craft ? Once we find that I think we can figure out who will find that most valuable start to offer it to them and to kind of just acknowledge like what we really are and what we really have and the assessments I think we can do after the fact, we can use these assessments to help guide and to expose and to help people see, but they shouldn’t be the basis of our program and we shouldn’t try to force people onto these platforms and we shouldn’t try it. I just Everything we do is an instrument to make sure that we make a software platform they can sell because we want to get off of international funding. Let’s just find the thing that we can do that brings in money that is valuable that is clear that is coherent that is powerful and we have things because we can see that people love us people love our programs.

I mean, that part is is is great. Our upside on pyramid approach where we focus on people answering their own questions first. Is trying to get at something here. Our, discussion of well-being, opening the space for people to talk about kind of the quality of their life and and how they're feeling Even Though taking the assessments and we don't actually really dig into it as much as we could. And don't talk about emotions and what they mean. We don't have a really clear language of sources of meaning yet. But I do think that having to start with why and trying to get people really clear on their intentions It's also another really great element. And breakout rooms and the kind of aliveness that we bring to our virtual facilitation the mentor program is is okay. I think it can be improved. Just the fact that we really try to give People connections to to to each other, to to mentors, to themselves, and really focusing on, like, all those deeper relationships. Right? It's like people with themselves, people with the people in the cohort, people with their mentors, and the programs that we run are pretty good. But idea of trying to start selling our software as is I'm not sure sure. It's actually quite useful because it doesn't actually Systematizer implements a lot of these things that require require a facilitator. Right? We we didn't build software that will that has kind of, like, a guide You know, people onboard right now, and there's nobody. It's just them, and and it kind of misses the points of things. And, you know, we're missing the community element that was not very integrated very well and the The notes section, you know, and we used to have program notes that people would be able to share like, on the platform with everyone in the program, but also kind of reflect on a couple of key questions that I thought was really helpful to, like, add that reflective process into our, software. And even that by itself just like getting in asking yourself, like, what do I wanna do today? What's the what's going on? And kind of exposing that both for yourself and your team and then potentially even people in the in the cohort was a really cool element that We removed Android I really miss it. What do how can we help stakeholders understand this shift? Well, I think stakeholders there are people out there that are trying to do philanthropy differently. That are trying to uphold certain values and ways of being and they're looking for a way forward, and I think we could really show some leadership here. There are foundations that focus on bringing to life spirituality in a practical way that is maybe cross cultural and cross religious and connects people with what matters. And I can think of, like, the Lilly Foundation, for and others We can find the right funders. And then what I think can happen is as we, find the right funders and we show our current funders the examples that we have about all of these businesses that are doing things different from Patagonia and onward that you can be both successful and doing things for the right reasons, and there's no reason not to and all the reasons that we should because we can't kind of perpetuate a way of seeing the world in ourselves through these enacted processes that are self reinforcing and just claim that this is the only way possible. When we have some examples that have broken the mold that have shown that there is solid ground underneath these ways and we should be contributing to them and not you know, missing out on that opportunity. And then just showing people like, get on the bus. We're going. Join us. In 6 months, I think success would look like a validated coming alive process Maybe a New sort of accelerator or incubator Claude, and just cleaning the language of in all of our guides of this speed and of this goal orientation. And finding new funders interested in funding a different way of supporting change in the world and really articulating the vision of the super bloom starting with the seeds that we're planting in this global garden. That Is being cultivated. I'm talking about, like, the cultivation of the super bloom not these sort of, like, Like, just the the forcing of the helping people come up with goals and strategies and habits of success, like, removing all of that language about habits of success forcing, like, goal orientation and instrumentalization of people and even instrumentalization of well-being, turning it what we what we have. And just like cleaning it of all that way of thinking that has influenced both me and and you know, like, I've grown and I've changed the way I see things, but we have so much good that I think we can take Android do in a different way with some slight shifts And in 6 months, I think we will have a new program to be able to offer the world and validated it by running coaching programs and hope hopefully having money coming in from our coaching and even potentially having, like, our coaching plus technology. So embedding us more deeply into our work and us having these deeper relationships with mentors if we want scalability and with AI if we want scalability, but us still having these deeper relationships and connections with people and passing on And being a part of the line of transmission of apprentice master. Right? And and becoming masters ourselves of what we're doing because we've done for so many years now. I think we have something to offer that you know, when we coach people, we can help them come to life. We can help them see what they're not seeing. And we can get better at it. And and once we become these masters, we can pass that on to the mentors. We pass that on to the software kind of architecture that creates this situation for emergence rather than this place where we get data from people. We get people to use the software to connect with each other, to connect with themselves, And in the process of doing the real thing, we can also have our outputs and get the territory to be the thing people are exploring and then for the software to be drawing out the maps. The end of the day, not the beginning of the day. Is the way I like to frame it and analogize it. This makes sense?",

I think You know, as we've been trying to support social enterprises, I've been initially, you know, like, feeling like their ideas of what good would look like if we connected with research and assessments that are validated and being able to know, kind of unify a segmented in industry of impact and show people's progress from one You know, accelerated to the next and And, like, somehow I feel like this is becoming less important to me as I really think that every success story is a unique story, and we can, like, see the patterns and maybe learn from them. But as we're moving into uncharted waters, we need new ways to be successful, to be shown from these people, and they need to trust themselves, and they need to learn from others. And so that balance between recognizing mastery and expertise and being the apprentice but also being the teacher. About what what is new and what can emerge. And the Aljazirah story talks about authentic authority versus constructed impact. Yeah. So social impact organizations need to have a real true story. Not just a story. Just a story of the problem and the solution and how they're the right person to do it, but a story that is true and alive and evolves and grows with them. And something that when they touch it, it has that coming alive juice that we get when we touch a real source of meaning, and we know why it's Meaningful. For them in a specific way, not an abstract way. Like, just like we use Joe Edelman and his values Claude, sources of meaning approach, and attentional policies. Like, getting to that level of granularity where we can ask people to tell us, you know, their origin stories and their sources of meaning they can be specific about it and Claude, and this is a beautiful and important thing both for them to know makes them come alive and how not to lose touch of that as they're working and making sure that those things are kind of know, maybe anchor points that can move certainly as we learn and grow and develop, but anchor points to help guide and move, an organization to the future and draw people that relate and resonate with those sources of meaning and funders that resonate with those sources of meaning instead of having these kind of abstract concepts of like, okay. Which funders are interested in Claude? And then which people are working on Claude? And which funders are interested in education. And which people are working on education or some kind of more like, other sort of elements of, like, oh, this person needs leadership and team building skills and who have leadership and team building skills. Think we can get kind of more to you know, if people really align on what's meaningful both in terms of what they're aspiring towards from role models and what they need can do better matchmaking between our partners, our mentors, and teams, and each other. And maybe at some point even get people to form teams based on these things and help people form teams. Yeah. So in that moment, I realized, like, in Dubai, I saw, like, I was living the thing that I valued And that when I was back in Not during a session Android was working on either a software or some report some other thing, the if it wasn't supporting that moments and these types of experiences, I'm not sure that it would be so meaningful for me. And so somehow either being able to connect with that as I'm doing the other work or indefinitely in ensuring that the things that made that moment so meaningful show up in as much of the other work as possible. Sure. There are going to be some instrumental things that we just have to do like send like putting out emails to the funders to schedule a call and finding time on our calendars that works for both of us. But if there's some kind of intentionality behind that, in recognition of pursuing sources of meaning or designing a our business to attend to these sources of meaning, I think it would be really important and and powerful. So let's take, all of the new insights that we've had and the stories that we've gained, and let's, rewrite part 1 and, move into you know, asking some more questions after you give me part 1 to work on part 2.

Let me rewrite Part I integrating these elements, then assess where we are with the overall essay.\n\n# Part I: From Doing Good to Recognizing Beauty\n\n## The Moment Everything Changed\n\nIn Dubai, watching entrepreneurs share their stories during our retreat, something shifted. As tears flowed and hearts opened, I witnessed something our carefully designed metrics and platforms could never capture: the pure beauty of people fully aligned with their calling. It wasn't just emotional response - it was recognition of something real, something our impact frameworks weren't built to see.\n\n## The Two Ways of Seeing\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Conventional Impact] -->|Focuses on| B[Metrics/Frameworks]\n    C[Quality Recognition] -->|Sees| D[Natural Beauty]\n    B -->|Creates| E[Constructed Stories]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Authentic Authority]\n    G[Personal Journey] -->|Shifts from| H[Doing Good]\n    G -->|Toward| I[Recognizing Beauty]\n```\n\nI felt this tension acutely when invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera. Despite our impressive metrics and frameworks, something felt inauthentic. We had constructed a story of impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge and speak for itself. This wasn't about inadequate measurement - it was about a fundamental misalignment in how we were seeing.\n\n## Beyond Best Practices\n\nInitially, our approach made perfect sense: validate assessments, unify a fragmented impact industry, track progress across accelerator programs. But as I worked with more entrepreneurs, I began to see something different. Every real success story was unique - not because it defied measurement, but because it emerged from authentic connection to meaning.\n\nThis isn't about abandoning measurement but about seeing with both eyes:\n- One eye for metrics and frameworks\n- One eye for direct quality recognition\n- Both needed for depth perception\n\n## The Nature of Real Authority\n\nWhat makes Father Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries so powerful isn't his impact metrics - it's the simple truth when he says \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability; it's revealing a different kind of authority that comes from authentic relationship rather than constructed impact.\n\n## A Different Kind of Story\n\nWe've learned that social enterprises need more than problem-solution narratives. They need stories that:\n- Emerge from real meaning\n- Evolve organically\n- Connect specifically to sources of meaning\n- Create natural resonance\n\nWhen entrepreneurs connect with their true sources of meaning, they naturally:\n- Attract aligned resources\n- Build authentic relationships\n- Create lasting impact\n- Enable natural growth\n\n## The Path Forward\n\nThis suggests a fundamental shift in how we support social impact:\n- From constructing impact to recognizing beauty\n- From forcing growth to enabling emergence\n- From measuring change to embodying meaning\n- From doing good to being alive\n\n---\n\nThree questions for developing Part II:\n\n1. How specifically does this capacity for quality recognition develop? Can you share examples of entrepreneurs discovering/trusting it?\n\n2. What makes this different from \"following your heart\" or \"trusting intuition\"? What gives it reliability?\n\n3. What blocks access to this faculty, especially in social impact work? What helps clear these blocks?\n\nBefore moving forward, some potential critiques to address:\n1. Could seem too abstract/impractical\n2. Might appear to dismiss importance of metrics\n3. Could be seen as privileging feeling over evidence\n4. Might not address practical constraints\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Address any of these critiques?\n2. Answer the questions for Part II?\n3. Refine Part I further?\n\nThe key is maintaining both practical relevance and depth while showing how this shift could transform social impact work.",

Every real success story was unique - not because it defied measurement, but because it emerged from authentic connection to meaning.\n\nThis isn't about abandoning measurement but about seeing with both eyes:\n- One eye for metrics and frameworks\n- One eye for direct quality recognition\n- Both needed for depth perception\n\n## The Nature of Real Authority\n\nWhat makes Father Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries so powerful isn't his impact metrics - it's the simple truth when he says \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability; it's revealing a different kind of authority that comes from authentic relationship rather than constructed impact.\n\n## A Different Kind of Story\n\nWe've learned that social enterprises need more than problem-solution narratives. They need stories that:\n- Emerge from real meaning\n- Evolve organically\n- Connect specifically to sources of meaning\n- Create natural resonance\n\nWhen entrepreneurs connect with their true sources of meaning, they naturally:\n- Attract aligned resources\n- Build authentic relationships\n- Create lasting impact\n- Enable natural growth\n\n## The Path Forward\n\nThis suggests a fundamental shift in how we support social impact:\n- From constructing impact to recognizing beauty\n- From forcing growth to enabling emergence\n- From measuring change to embodying meaning\n- From doing good to being alive\n\n---\n\nThree questions for developing Part II:\n\n1. How specifically does this capacity for quality recognition develop? Can you share examples of entrepreneurs discovering/trusting it?\n\n2. What makes this different from \"following your heart\" or \"trusting intuition\"? What gives it reliability?\n\n3. What blocks access to this faculty, especially in social impact work? What helps clear these blocks?\n\nBefore moving forward, some potential critiques to address:\n1. Could seem too abstract/impractical\n2. Might appear to dismiss importance of metrics\n3. Could be seen as privileging feeling over evidence\n4. Might not address practical constraints\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Address any of these critiques?\n2. Answer the questions for Part II?\n3. Refine Part I further?\n\nThe key is maintaining both practical relevance and depth while showing how this shift could transform social impact work.",

I think we should talk about that together. We should look at what we have to offer and I sort of propose the idea of this framework developing to come alive being a sellable coaching practice for the course of a month and we run maybe the first few as pro bono tests and maybe even do it in partnership with professional coaches to get their kind of accreditation behind us and then from there we can take our lessons learned and sell some seats and that could be our bread and butter paid work - it’s ok that it doesn’t scale - I think it’ll feel real and whole and good and give us insights into what should scale"

            "extracted_content": "EditLet's develop this as a full essay, starting with Part I. Here's our approach:\nPlan:\n\nWrite each section fully using all available content\nAfter each section, ask 3 targeted questions for the next section\nUse your answers to build subsequent sections\nIncorporate diagrams where helpful\nMaintain depth while ensuring readability\n\nStarting with Part I - Personal Journey: The Two Eyes\nFrom Metrics to Meaning: A New Vision for Social Impact\nPart I: Journey to Seeing with Both Eyes\nThe story of how I came to question our approach to social impact began in Dubai, watching entrepreneurs share their stories during our retreat. As tears flowed and hearts opened, I witnessed something our carefully designed metrics could never capture: the pure beauty of people fully aligned with their calling. In that moment, I realized we had been operating with one eye closed.\nThe Blindness of Single Vision\nLike many in social impact, I had internalized a worldview that prioritized measurement over meaning. We created dashboards, tracked KPIs, designed frameworks - all valuable tools, but ones that had somehow become primary rather than supportive. It was like navigating solely by map without looking at the territory, or trying to understand music purely through its sheet music without ever hearing it played.\nThis manifested most clearly in our platform metrics push. We needed data to improve, so we pushed entrepreneurs to engage online, even when it felt forced. Our metrics demanded it, but something deeper - a faculty I hadn't yet learned to trust - signaled this wasn't right.\nBreaking Through\nThe breakthrough came from recognizing that this sense wasn't just emotion or intuition - it was a legitimate perceptual faculty, as real as sight or hearing. This faculty lets us recognize quality directly, without needing to measure or analyze. It's what lets a master craftsperson know when something is right, what enables a teacher to recognize genuine understanding, what allows a community to sense authentic leadership.\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Single Vision: Metrics] -->|Leads to| B[Forced Outcomes]\n    C[Double Vision: Metrics + Quality] -->|Enables| D[Natural Emergence]\n    B -->|Creates| E[Resistance/Depletion]\n    D -->|Creates| F[Alignment/Growth]\n    G[Quality Recognition] -->|Informs| H[Better Metrics]\n    H -->|Supports| G\nThe Dubai Moment\nThis clarity crystallized watching our entrepreneurs share their work. Their stories weren't impressive because of impact numbers or scale metrics - though many had these. They moved us because we could recognize, directly and without analysis, the beauty of people aligned with genuine purpose. We saw what happens when someone connects with what they're meant to do and finds ways to serve that are uniquely theirs.\nTwo Eyes Open\nNow I understand: we need both eyes open. One eye for metrics and measurement - the map that helps us navigate and track progress. And one eye for direct quality recognition - the territory itself, the reality our maps try to represent. Like stereoscopic vision, it's the integration of both that gives depth and true understanding.\nThis isn't about abandoning metrics or structure. It's about putting them in proper place - as tools serving something more fundamental: our natural capacity to recognize and create quality, beauty, and meaning.\n\nTo help develop Part II (What's Really Missing), I'd like to ask:\n\nCan you share specific examples of how this quality recognition faculty showed up in your work before you had language for it? Times when you \"just knew\" something was right or wrong?\nHow does this faculty differ from intuition or emotion? What makes it more reliable?\nWhen you talk about both eyes being open, what specific practices help you maintain this integration of metrics and meaning?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions so we can develop the next section? CopyRetryBGyou have descriptions of my quality recognition both at bloom and in my love story in your context window - perhaps ultimately in the quality recognition of the beauty in father greg boyles work, or the recognition of goodness that led me to work with Munir/Dara and the goodness that emerges from that vs the disease i felt when i was invited to aljazeera to talk about my work and i felt sleezy and slimy and like who am i - my work isn't authentic enough and sincere that i can shine like a clear glass showing the beauty, that tension led me to ask - how should i do things? what is a beautiful action? and i found father greg boyles work with homeboy and home girl industry helpfulintuition and emotion told me that i was doing things for the wrong reason, it was a tense feeling that pointed at my true source of meaning that was blocked from coming to live. that i wanted to be authentically a part of a community of mutual care, and hearing father greg boyles story showed me how it was possible and showed me how without artiface for \"doing the right thing\" it was possible to find a source of meaning and ... well, sort of do the right thing, except this time it's for a beautiful reason... no reason at all. because of the love of your friends - non instrumental. i didn't have that language and now i do and it helps instrumental things often have feelings associated. think of have to vs want to - have to is instrumental, ih ave to get a job to get... the tension that comes from instrumental things comes from the time it takes to do them that takes away from things you want to do, instrumental are things you'd automate/delegate/accelerate, something about rushing at Bloom shows me that we are instrumental. if we weren't operating instrumentally I don't think we'd feel like we were rushing all the time. it's a great symbol for us and for our teams - do you feel rushed? well, perhaps you're operating out of fear/instrumental/tense emotion indicators that there are ways of being you're not able to access and perhaps those ways of being willa ctually lead to the thing you want. for instance BLoom wants to build software to scale our impact, yet we build software first and then ask people to get on, vs building software after ensuring it helps us live our values through prototypes on paper, in manual systems, on spreadsheets, with airtable, etc gradually systematizing the context that creates emergence and beauty and streamlineing the things that need to be instrumental (for instance finding a mentors phone number or email)i think practices of presence helps, learning to trust slow is smooth and smooth is fast, acknowledging the quality perception is reliable and true to act on, and finding ways to discern it by addressing emotions directly, talking about them, seeing what they imply about blocked sources of meaning, which also helps with presence, as does deciding things, less things coming to mind to do, decide and chop (decide comes from incision) all the things that don't matter till you can be present with what doesEditThank you for these rich responses. Let me draft Part II of the essay, building on these insights:\nPart II: What's Really Missing - Beyond Metrics to Meaning\nThe Tension We All Feel\nThe rushing tells us something. When we feel constantly hurried at Bloom, when we push to build software before ensuring it serves real needs, when we chase metrics that don't quite capture what matters - these aren't just operational issues. They're symptoms of a deeper misalignment: trying to achieve meaningful ends through instrumental means.\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Rushing/Tension] -->|Signals| B[Instrumental Approach]\n    C[Presence/Flow] -->|Signals| D[Aligned Action]\n    B -->|Creates| E[More Rushing]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Natural Timing]\n    G[Fear/Have to] -->|Drives| B\n    H[Love/Want to] -->|Guides| D\nThe Different Quality of Non-Instrumental Action\nFather Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries illuminates this distinction perfectly. When asked about his \"impact metrics,\" he offers something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability - it's recognizing that real impact emerges from genuine relationship, not instrumental calculation.\nThis shows up in how we feel about our work. When invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera, I felt a deep unease - not because the work wasn't valuable, but because I sensed it wasn't yet flowing from that place of pure recognition and response. The contrast with Father Greg's natural authority was stark: his impact flows from friendship, while I was still caught in metrics and justification.\nThe Nature of Quality Recognition\nWhat we're missing isn't another framework or better metrics. It's trust in our capacity to recognize quality directly. This isn't intuition or emotion, though these can point us toward it. Rather:\n\nEmotions and tension often signal blocked meaning\n\"Have to\" versus \"want to\" reveals instrumental thinking\nRushing indicates misaligned action\nQuality recognition feels like natural rightness\n\nFrom Signals to Sources\nThe key shift happens when we learn to read these signals not as problems to solve but as pointers toward blocked sources of meaning:\n\nTension points to possibilities we're not seeing\nFear indicates protection rather than presence\nRushing reveals misaligned timing\nDoubt suggests disconnection from quality\n\nWhen we feel that sliminess of inauthenticity or the tension of forced metrics, we're receiving valuable information. These feelings aren't the truth itself - they're signals pointing toward a truth we already recognize but haven't yet trusted or acted upon.\nThe Practice of Presence\nDeveloping this capacity requires specific practices:\n\nSlowing down to sense what's really needed\nAddressing emotions directly to see what they reveal\nMaking clear decisions that reduce mental noise\nCreating space for quality recognition\nBuilding from authentic relationship\n\nThe result isn't slower work but what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - action that flows naturally from recognition rather than being forced by metrics or fear.\n\nTo help develop Part III (Gardens, Craft, and Seeing), I'd like to ask:\n\nHow does the gardening metaphor specifically help us understand the relationship between control and emergence in social impact work?\nWhat aspects of traditional craft practices most clearly illustrate the integration of metrics and meaning you're describing?\nCan you share specific examples of how this \"smooth is fast\" quality shows up when organizations trust quality recognition?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions before we move to the next section? CopyRetryBGThe gardening metaphor helps us think about setting the stage and sitting back to witness and be in awe and to be in gratitude and to also have goals. Like, we want tomatoes. Right? We need tomatoes. We're hungry. But to plant the right seeds, right, the analogy of what that seed is, And to, set the right context for that seed, and to Hope for the things that you can't control And to live in that liminal space of hope and fear and concern and aliveness rather than planning and getting to the end of the strategy and the arrogance that comes in thinking that you think that you can figure out how the world works to keep yourself safe, which is not possible and not true. And so gardening, it puts you into that state of present state awareness, being in the now, watching, tending, feeling the water, seeing the soil, seeing the seeds, seeing the predators, seeing the pests and insects, learning to be a part of the system, and to be alive rather than to expect sameness. And if we're not gardeners, we want the world to be up operated more like a factory or like factory farm where we're just expecting inputs and outputs and this idea of control, which stems from this idea that we can't trust people. You know, that we can't trust. The world, we can't trust nature to provide. Right? And that humans are the ones that are gonna figure things out. We're gonna control and master the universe and get what we need out of it. And that's it. That that attitude builds fragility because we're building these systems in opposition to the emergence of nature rather than in harmony with And so gardening lets us build in harmony with And and to be alive and that state of, like, gratitude that comes when your trust and your Confidence that builds when you develop mastery iOS like, you know, I've done this for the last 10 years, 150 years. My family has done this for the last 100 years, 200 years. That yeah, you know, we've been through this before. We've had drought. We've had periods of hunger. But we've also made plans you know, We have an expertise where, you know, maybe we save part of our harvest. We learn to pickle. Know? Some of what we get, we don't eat all of our produce that we harvest every year. In anticipation for those dry years because that is also a part of the cycle, and that kind of history and wisdom and a crude knowledge and story of the world and story of self and gratitude for abundance and acknowledging there are periods of dryness and that we can be patient and that sort of is needed for that moment of abundance and and how beautiful is that? And I think traditional craft practices kind of connect moral relationally, with things, and that relationship is alive. I I know a relation you don't have a relationship. You live a relationship. It's dynamic. It's changing. And this idea of A craft turning material into relationships, turning stuff into a conversation that you have. With the person who holds the pot that you've made or who uses the systems that you're developing or who is experiencing the craft of your music of your performance, of your talk, of your workshop, for instance. All of these things are more relational, and this craft has these different qualities that I think are really important. Right? Like, in craft, You Connects with quality and quantity. You get into presence as you're planning the wood. The movement and the action is measuring as you are sensing, and there's that kind of coming together, this balance, this fulcrum point between the 2. And there's this connection of, like, you learn a craft You know that you don't start innovating when you first learn how to draw, that you like get through the paces. Picasso was really amazing at traditional drawing, and painting before he decided to break the form You have to know the form that you can break. And There's these, elements like Yeah. Connecting with sustainability because you wanna source material and you know what you're using. And it integrates materiality and Addresses alienation and there's a practicality to it. It's also really beautiful. Yeah. There's a different way of making relating. Valuing, scaling, that happens when we think through craft. Quality. There's a big part of craft. And iOS beauty is a big part of craft. The quality and quantity come together in a functional object that is also connected to the the the sense of meaning and and purpose that the crafts person has as they're making it and then imbues it with with physical and psychological and and like, beauty that you can you can sense and that you can engage with. And through attention, all of our different types of work can be a craft. We're connecting to presence and care and meaning. And there's a natural sensibility to sustainability because quality reduces waste, and it connects to traditional wisdom that is ecological and and and handed from the past to the present uses local materials and there's a community connection that creates culture And it's connected to skills and and kind of knowing yourself through what you're making. And craft requires attention. Right? And attention is the thing that is connected to presence into our values. Quality emerges from care and the type of slowness as well that helps us do the right thing. At the right time. And there's knowledge transfer that connects us into relationships with the past and the future. And with material understanding of, like, deep ecological knowledge and sustainable resource use. Smooth is fast. Quality shows up when organizations trust quality recognition. Yeah. That the the the realization that you can't access that recognition if you're rushing And then that recognition is more reliable source of knowing what to do You know? And, like, we've all had that experience of rushing and like, trying to cook dinner and then Like breaking a jar of beans and then taking a longer time to make dinner because you broke the jar of beans. And if we can just not break that jar of beans, and actually just take our time to be more confident and the energy that emerges from that sense of awareness like, the rightness and the ability to convince ourselves and convince others when we can point towards the source of meaning. That's why the idea that meaning has one source is so important because when we tap into that source of meaning, gonna be motivating for us and for others. And you know, by going slow enough to see that, to help others see that, we can go a lot faster because it'll be alignment and different skills from different people will be able to be put to use towards the direction that that beauty is indicatingEditThank you for this rich exploration. Let me draft Part III of the essay, integrating these insights:\nPart III: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing - Natural Models for Social Impact\nThe Wisdom of Gardens\nWhen we approach social impact like gardeners rather than factory managers, everything changes. A gardener needs tomatoes, yes - there are real outcomes to achieve. But they understand something profound about how change happens: you can't force a seed to grow. You can only create conditions that support its natural unfolding.\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Factory Mindset] -->|Attempts| B[Control/Force]\n    C[Garden Mindset] -->|Creates| D[Conditions for Growth]\n    B -->|Results in| E[Fragility]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Natural Resilience]\n    G[Wisdom/Experience] -->|Informs| H[Patient Action]\n    I[Present Awareness] -->|Guides| J[Timely Response]\nThis isn't passive - it requires deep engagement:\n\nReading the soil and weather\nUnderstanding natural cycles\nLearning from experience\nPlanning for lean times\nResponding to challenges\n\nBut it's a different kind of engagement. Instead of attempting to control outcomes through force, we participate in something larger. This creates natural resilience rather than artificial stability.\nThe Craft Way of Seeing\nCraft offers another crucial model. When a craftsperson works with materials, something remarkable happens: mere stuff becomes relationship. A pot isn't just clay shaped by technique - it's a conversation between maker, material, and eventual user. This transforms how we understand quality and scale:\nQuality Through Relationship\n\nDirect material engagement\nBalance of measurement and feeling\nIntegration of planning and presence\nNatural sustainability through care\n\nLearning Through Tradition\n\nMastering form before innovation\nKnowledge passed through practice\nCommunity-held wisdom\nDeep material understanding\n\nNatural Scale\n\nQuality reduces waste\nLocal materials create resilience\nSkills build community\nBeauty spreads naturally\n\nThe Integration of Measurement and Meaning\nWhat makes craft particularly relevant for social impact is how it naturally integrates quantitative and qualitative understanding. A craftsperson's movements embody both measurement and sensing - they're not separate activities but aspects of one integrated way of knowing.\nThis shows us how metrics and meaning can work together:\n\nQuality emerges from careful attention\nMeasurement serves beauty\nForm enables rather than constrains\nTradition guides innovation\n\nSmooth is Fast: The Paradox of Pace\nPerhaps most importantly, craft teaches us about timing. Like the cook who breaks the jar by rushing, we often create delays through forced speed. But when we trust quality recognition:\n\nNatural rhythm emerges\nRight action becomes clear\nOthers align naturally\nResources flow appropriately\n\nThis isn't slow for slowness' sake. It's what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - the paradoxical efficiency that comes from aligned action rather than forced effort.\nImplications for Social Impact\nThis suggests a different approach to social enterprise:\n\nCreate conditions rather than force outcomes\nBuild capacity through relationship\nLet quality guide growth\nTrust natural timing\n\nWhen we do this:\n\nImpact emerges naturally\nCommunities build resilience\nResources align with needs\nBeauty spreads organically\n\nThe key is seeing that, like gardens and craft, social impact isn't something we make happen through force. It's something we participate in through wise attention and aligned action.\n\nTo help develop Part IV (Practical Implications for Bloom), I'd like to ask:\n\nWhat specific practices or structures at Bloom would need to change first to embody these principles?\nHow would our relationship with entrepreneurs shift if we approached support more like gardening or craft apprenticeship?\nWhat experiments could we run to test these ideas while managing practical constraints?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions before we move to the next section? CopyRetryBGI think one of the things that would have to change is our focus on the software and I would challenge our fundamental hypotheses about keeping quality while scaling and using software to have a bigger impact. I think we should focus on the elements of the software that we really believe in us are valuable and ignore the rest and just don’t even necessarily try to sell it like focus on the experience. I don’t believe that we’ve made something valuable that just needs to be sold. I think we are now at a point where AI and software development has developed to have made what we have made quite nearly irrelevant, and so it would be to look at our programs and look at our offerings and see who we can serve with who we our true craft what is our craft ? Once we find that I think we can figure out who will find that most valuable start to offer it to them and to kind of just acknowledge like what we really are and what we really have and the assessments I think we can do after the fact, we can use these assessments to help guide and to expose and to help people see, but they shouldn’t be the basis of our program and we shouldn’t try to force people onto these platforms and we shouldn’t try it. I just Everything we do is an instrument to make sure that we make a software platform they can sell because we want to get off of international funding. Let’s just find the thing that we can do that brings in money that is valuable that is clear that is coherent that is powerful and we have things because we can see that people love us people love our programs. Well if they love us so much why don’t they pay? Why don’t we make it possible for us to not have a complicated business model and at least have some thing that we can craft and do that’s our bread and butter and deals with like the things that matter to us and give us us insight as to what we can build and streamline and can access to people and develops our network and does all these things, but in a way where the model is clear. For our participants : to our entrepreneurs, they will feel seen, connected, increase in self knowledge which leads to self confidence, agency, know their fears, emotions, trust their perception of beauty, be more articulate about their values, know how to share, align, find resources themselves, not be perpetual program chasers, they will have access to knowledgable mentors, they will know what they are doing is a craft, that there's no shortcut, there's no hack, there is wisdom, there are beautiful ways of being, that wellbeing is not extricable from welldoing because wellbeing is touching with sources of meaning which include yourself, when you connect to that faculty you come alive, affecting yourself and your positive change in the team around you, the work you do, you become a light and attract people, funding, skills, knowledge, etc for our team we will work more on gardening, cultivating circumstance, situations, finding the right knowledgable mentors ensure we sit with them long enough and we're sure that our space holding and emergent principles are understood, felt, imbibed and valued, we will seek funding that doesn't lead us to treat our participants as instrumental, our customers will also be those whom we impact, including funders, they are a part of the presencing field - deeper connections, more time with teams, we will use our quantitatie frameworks to monitor at the end of the day / week / month / program and in the day, at the start we begin with understanding, seeing, feeling, knowing, emerging, and touch the territory before we plug in numbers on the map and see where we are going for our partners they will be integrated more deeply, they will find and connect with their sources of meaning, how it shows up in our programs, for our teams, we will find funding that flows where people value rather than some idea of value, or social norm of \"good\" - we'll touch reality together and in terms of the experiment so we can run. I think we should talk about that together. We should look at what we have to offer and I sort of propose the idea of this framework developing to come alive being a sellable coaching practice for the course of a month and we run maybe the first few as pro bono tests and maybe even do it in partnership with professional coaches to get their kind of accreditation behind us and then from there we can take our lessons learned and sell some seats and that could be our bread and butter paid work - it’s ok that it doesn’t scale - I think it’ll feel real and whole and good and give us insights into what should scaleEditPart IV: Practical Implications for Bloom - From Platform to Practice\nRethinking Our Foundation\nThe most profound implication of this shift in thinking requires us to challenge our core assumption: that software is our path to scale and sustainability. In an age where AI and new technologies are rapidly transforming digital tools, we need to ask ourselves a more fundamental question: What is our true craft?\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Current Approach] -->|Forces| B[Platform Usage]\n    C[Craft Approach] -->|Enables| D[Natural Value]\n    B -->|Creates| E[Artificial Engagement]\n    D -->|Generates| F[Authentic Growth]\n    G[Quality Recognition] -->|Guides| H[Service Evolution]\n    I[Software] -->|Supports| J[Human Connection]\nWhat We Really Offer\nThe evidence of our value is clear but misunderstood:\n\nPeople love our programs\nTransformation happens consistently\nDeep connections form\nReal growth emerges\n\nYet we've been trying to capture this in software, attempting to scale what might not be meant for scaling. Instead, we need to:\n\nFocus on our genuine craft\nLet value guide structure\nAllow natural growth\nTrust quality recognition\n\nA New Model for Our Work\nFor Entrepreneurs\nInstead of pushing platform engagement, we create conditions where they:\n\nFeel truly seen and connected\nDevelop self-knowledge and confidence\nLearn to trust their quality recognition\nAccess genuine wisdom\nFind natural resources and support\n\nFor Our Team\nWe shift from monitoring to nurturing:\n\nCultivating circumstances for growth\nFinding and connecting with true mentors\nEnsuring principles are embodied not just understood\nUsing metrics to reflect rather than direct\nStarting with territory before consulting maps\n\nFor Partners\nRelationships deepen naturally:\n\nIntegration with meaning\nAuthentic value creation\nReality-based assessment\nNatural resource flow\n\nThe Path Forward\nSpecific Changes Required:\n\nProgram Focus\n\n\nStart with direct relationship\nLet technology support not lead\nMeasure after, not during\nBuild from real value\n\n\nBusiness Model\n\n\nSimple, clear value proposition\nDirect payment for real service\nNatural growth from quality\nSustainable core practice\n\n\nAssessment Approach\n\n\nQuality recognition first\nMetrics for reflection\nNatural feedback loops\nOrganic development\n\nPractical Experiments\n\nCome Alive Coaching\n\n\nStart with pro bono trials\nPartner with professional coaches\nDocument real transformation\nBuild from genuine results\n\n\nCore Practice Development\n\n\nIdentify our true craft\nFocus on direct value\nLet natural scale emerge\nTrust quality recognition\n\n\nRelationship Restructuring\n\n\nDirect connection with participants\nValue-based funding relationships\nCommunity of practice\nNatural growth patterns\n\nThe Technology Question\nInstead of forcing platform adoption, technology should:\n\nSupport human connection\nEnable natural processes\nDocument real value\nScale what works naturally\n\nThis means:\n\nSimpler tools\nDirect support of practice\nNatural integration\nOrganic growth\n\nMeasuring Success Differently\nSuccess looks like:\n\nReal transformation in participants\nSustainable value creation\nNatural resource flow\nCommunity growth\nQuality recognition development\n\nThis isn't abandoning scale but trusting that:\n\nQuality creates natural growth\nValue attracts resources\nBeauty spreads organically\nWisdom develops naturally\n\nThe key is starting with what's real and valuable, letting genuine craft guide our development rather than forcing growth through artificial means.\n\nTo help develop our final section (Path Forward), I'd like to ask:\n\nWhat specific elements of our current work most clearly embody this approach already?\nHow do we help stakeholders understand and trust this shift?\nWhat would success look like in 6 months if we follow this path?\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions before we complete the essay? CopyRetryBGI think our custom learning journey that focuses on helping people kind of identify the challenges in their life and their projects with assessments is actually a really good Start It's not that I'm only negative in critiquing our, software. I mean, that part is is is great. Our upside on pyramid approach where we focus on people answering their own questions first. Is trying to get at something here. Our, discussion of well-being, opening the space for people to talk about kind of the quality of their life and and how they're feeling Even Though taking the assessments and we don't actually really dig into it as much as we could. And don't talk about emotions and what they mean. We don't have a really clear language of sources of meaning yet. But I do think that having to start with why and trying to get people really clear on their intentions It's also another really great element. And breakout rooms and the kind of aliveness that we bring to our virtual facilitation the mentor program is is okay. I think it can be improved. Just the fact that we really try to give People connections to to to each other, to to mentors, to themselves, and really focusing on, like, all those deeper relationships. Right? It's like people with themselves, people with the people in the cohort, people with their mentors, and the programs that we run are pretty good. But idea of trying to start selling our software as is I'm not sure sure. It's actually quite useful because it doesn't actually Systematizer implements a lot of these things that require require a facilitator. Right? We we didn't build software that will that has kind of, like, a guide You know, people onboard right now, and there's nobody. It's just them, and and it kind of misses the points of things. And, you know, we're missing the community element that was not very integrated very well and the The notes section, you know, and we used to have program notes that people would be able to share like, on the platform with everyone in the program, but also kind of reflect on a couple of key questions that I thought was really helpful to, like, add that reflective process into our, software. And even that by itself just like getting in asking yourself, like, what do I wanna do today? What's the what's going on? And kind of exposing that both for yourself and your team and then potentially even people in the in the cohort was a really cool element that We removed Android I really miss it. What do how can we help stakeholders understand this shift? Well, I think stakeholders there are people out there that are trying to do philanthropy differently. That are trying to uphold certain values and ways of being and they're looking for a way forward, and I think we could really show some leadership here. There are foundations that focus on bringing to life spirituality in a practical way that is maybe cross cultural and cross religious and connects people with what matters. And I can think of, like, the Lilly Foundation, for and others We can find the right funders. And then what I think can happen is as we, find the right funders and we show our current funders the examples that we have about all of these businesses that are doing things different from Patagonia and onward that you can be both successful and doing things for the right reasons, and there's no reason not to and all the reasons that we should because we can't kind of perpetuate a way of seeing the world in ourselves through these enacted processes that are self reinforcing and just claim that this is the only way possible. When we have some examples that have broken the mold that have shown that there is solid ground underneath these ways and we should be contributing to them and not you know, missing out on that opportunity. And then just showing people like, get on the bus. We're going. Join us. In 6 months, I think success would look like a validated coming alive process Maybe a New sort of accelerator or incubator Claude, and just cleaning the language of in all of our guides of this speed and of this goal orientation. And finding new funders interested in funding a different way of supporting change in the world and really articulating the vision of the super bloom starting with the seeds that we're planting in this global garden. That Is being cultivated. I'm talking about, like, the cultivation of the super bloom not these sort of, like, Like, just the the forcing of the helping people come up with goals and strategies and habits of success, like, removing all of that language about habits of success forcing, like, goal orientation and instrumentalization of people and even instrumentalization of well-being, turning it what we what we have. And just like cleaning it of all that way of thinking that has influenced both me and and you know, like, I've grown and I've changed the way I see things, but we have so much good that I think we can take Android do in a different way with some slight shifts And in 6 months, I think we will have a new program to be able to offer the world and validated it by running coaching programs and hope hopefully having money coming in from our coaching and even potentially having, like, our coaching plus technology. So embedding us more deeply into our work and us having these deeper relationships with mentors if we want scalability and with AI if we want scalability, but us still having these deeper relationships and connections with people and passing on And being a part of the line of transmission of apprentice master. Right? And and becoming masters ourselves of what we're doing because we've done for so many years now. I think we have something to offer that you know, when we coach people, we can help them come to life. We can help them see what they're not seeing. And we can get better at it. And and once we become these masters, we can pass that on to the mentors. We pass that on to the software kind of architecture that creates this situation for emergence rather than this place where we get data from people. We get people to use the software to connect with each other, to connect with themselves, And in the process of doing the real thing, we can also have our outputs and get the territory to be the thing people are exploring and then for the software to be drawing out the maps. The end of the day, not the beginning of the day. Is the way I like to frame it and analogize it. This makes sense?EditPart V: The Path Forward - From Where We Are to Where We're Called\nBuilding from Strength\nLooking clearly at our work, we already have powerful elements aligned with this vision:\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Current Strengths] --> B[Custom Learning Journeys]\n    A --> C[Upside-down Pyramid]\n    A --> D[Wellbeing Focus]\n    A --> E[Start with Why]\n    A --> F[Virtual Facilitation]\n    B --> G[Natural Evolution]\n    C --> G\n    D --> G\n    E --> G\n    F --> G\n    G --> H[New Model]\n    I[Quality Recognition] --> J[Guides Development]\n    K[Community] --> L[Enables Growth]\nWhat's Working:\n\nLearning Journeys\n\n\nCustom assessment approach\nPersonal challenge identification\nIndividual growth paths\n\n\nCore Practices\n\n\nUpside-down pyramid methodology\nStarting with deeper why\nFocus on wellbeing\nBreaking out for connection\nRelationship building\n\n\nCommunity Elements\n\n\nCohort connections\nMentor relationships\nPeer learning\nReflective practice\n\nNecessary Shifts\nFrom Software-First to Human-First:\n\nTechnology supports don't leads\nCommunity precedes platform\nRelationship drives development\nReflection guides action\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning:\n\nRemove \"habits of success\" language\nShift from goals to emergence\nTransform assessment approach\nStart with territory, end with maps\n\nFrom Programs to Practice:\n\nCoaching as core offering\nDeep relationship building\nMaster-apprentice model\nNatural development paths\n\nPractical Next Steps\n\nImmediate Actions (1-3 months):\n\n\nLaunch pilot coaching program\nClean language/materials\nDocument current successes\nStart stakeholder conversations\n\n\nMedium Term (3-6 months):\n\n\nValidate \"Come Alive\" methodology\nDevelop new funding relationships\nCreate craft-based accelerator model\nBuild natural assessment approach\n\n\nLong Term Vision:\n\n\nBecome transmission line for wisdom\nCreate conditions for emergence\nEnable natural scale through quality\nBuild true mastery\n\nStakeholder Engagement\n\nFinding Aligned Partners:\n\n\nFoundations focused on practical spirituality\nFunders seeking systemic change\nPartners valuing depth over scale\nCommunities supporting transformation\n\n\nDemonstrating Value:\n\n\nShare success stories\nShow alternative models working\nDocument real transformation\nBuild evidence through practice\n\n\nCreating New Narratives:\n\n\nFrom scale to depth\nFrom metrics to meaning\nFrom control to emergence\nFrom programs to practice\n\nMeasures of Success\nIn 6 months we should see:\n\nValidated Methodology\n\n\nTested coaching approach\nClear value proposition\nNatural payment model\nDirect impact evidence\n\n\nTransformed Relationships\n\n\nDeeper mentor connections\nStronger community bonds\nAligned funding partners\nClear transmission lines\n\n\nNew Offerings\n\n\nCraft-based accelerator\nIntegrated technology support\nQuality-centered assessment\nNatural growth patterns\n\nThe Super Bloom Vision\nInstead of forcing growth, we cultivate conditions where:\n\nBeauty emerges naturally\nWisdom transfers clearly\nCommunity builds organically\nImpact flows naturally\n\nThis isn't slower - it's aligned with natural timing.

Could you share more about specific moments where this shift in perception became clear - especially in your work with entrepreneurs?\nThe Al Jazeera story reveals something about authentic authority vs constructed impact. How has this insight shaped your understanding of what social impact organizations really need?\nYou mentioned the Dubai moment when tears flowed and hearts opened - what specifically did you recognize in that moment about the relationship between metrics and meaning?\n\nThese elements could help strengthen Part I by:\n\nGrounding theory in lived experience\nShowing progression of understanding\nMaking stakes more concrete\nConnecting personal journey to organizational implications\n\nWould you like to respond to these questions to help refine Part I? CopyRetryBG Yeah. Okay. So sorry about trying to do good to recognizing beauty directly and having good emerge. Yeah. I think You know, as we've been trying to support social enterprises, I've been initially, you know, like, feeling like their ideas of what good would look like if we connected with research and assessments that are validated and being able to know, kind of unify a segmented in industry of impact and show people's progress from one You know, accelerated to the next and And, like, somehow I feel like this is becoming less important to me as I really think that every success story is a unique story, and we can, like, see the patterns and maybe learn from them. But as we're moving into uncharted waters, we need new ways to be successful, to be shown from these people, and they need to trust themselves, and they need to learn from others. And so that balance between recognizing mastery and expertise and being the apprentice but also being the teacher. About what what is new and what can emerge. And the Aljazirah story talks about authentic authority versus constructed impact. Yeah. So social impact organizations need to have a real true story. Not just a story. Just a story of the problem and the solution and how they're the right person to do it, but a story that is true and alive and evolves and grows with them. And something that when they touch it, it has that coming alive juice that we get when we touch a real source of meaning, and we know why it's Meaningful. For them in a specific way, not an abstract way. Like, just like we use Joe Edelman and his values Claude, sources of meaning approach, and attentional policies. Like, getting to that level of granularity where we can ask people to tell us, you know, their origin stories and their sources of meaning they can be specific about it and Claude, and this is a beautiful and important thing both for them to know makes them come alive and how not to lose touch of that as they're working and making sure that those things are kind of know, maybe anchor points that can move certainly as we learn and grow and develop, but anchor points to help guide and move, an organization to the future and draw people that relate and resonate with those sources of meaning and funders that resonate with those sources of meaning instead of having these kind of abstract concepts of like, okay. Which funders are interested in Claude? And then which people are working on Claude? And which funders are interested in education. And which people are working on education or some kind of more like, other sort of elements of, like, oh, this person needs leadership and team building skills and who have leadership and team building skills. Think we can get kind of more to you know, if people really align on what's meaningful both in terms of what they're aspiring towards from role models and what they need can do better matchmaking between our partners, our mentors, and teams, and each other. And maybe at some point even get people to form teams based on these things and help people form teams. Yeah. So in that moment, I realized, like, in Dubai, I saw, like, I was living the thing that I valued And that when I was back in Not during a session Android was working on either a software or some report some other thing, the if it wasn't supporting that moments and these types of experiences, I'm not sure that it would be so meaningful for me. And so somehow either being able to connect with that as I'm doing the other work or indefinitely in ensuring that the things that made that moment so meaningful show up in as much of the other work as possible. Sure. There are going to be some instrumental things that we just have to do like send like putting out emails to the funders to schedule a call and finding time on our calendars that works for both of us. But if there's some kind of intentionality behind that, in recognition of pursuing sources of meaning or designing a our business to attend to these sources of meaning, I think it would be really important and and powerful. So let's take, all of the new insights that we've had and the stories that we've gained, and let's, rewrite part 1 and, move into you know, asking some more questions after you give me part 1 to work on part 2. And sort of review the whole thing as well. Like, how are we doing with the essay? Is there any flaws or draw backs or issues or critiques that might come up that we need to address?EditThank you for these rich insights. Let me rewrite Part I integrating these elements, then assess where we are with the overall essay.\nPart I: From Doing Good to Recognizing Beauty\nThe Moment Everything Changed\nIn Dubai, watching entrepreneurs share their stories during our retreat, something shifted. As tears flowed and hearts opened, I witnessed something our carefully designed metrics and platforms could never capture: the pure beauty of people fully aligned with their calling. It wasn't just emotional response - it was recognition of something real, something our impact frameworks weren't built to see.\nThe Two Ways of Seeing\nmermaidCopygraph TD\n    A[Conventional Impact] -->|Focuses on| B[Metrics/Frameworks]\n    C[Quality Recognition] -->|Sees| D[Natural Beauty]\n    B -->|Creates| E[Constructed Stories]\n    D -->|Enables| F[Authentic Authority]\n    G[Personal Journey] -->|Shifts from| H[Doing Good]\n    G -->|Toward| I[Recognizing Beauty]\nI felt this tension acutely when invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera. Despite our impressive metrics and frameworks, something felt inauthentic. We had constructed a story of impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge and speak for itself. This wasn't about inadequate measurement - it was about a fundamental misalignment in how we were seeing.\nBeyond Best Practices\nInitially, our approach made perfect sense: validate assessments, unify a fragmented impact industry, track progress across accelerator programs. But as I worked with more entrepreneurs, I began to see something different. Every real success story was unique - not because it defied measurement, but because it emerged from authentic connection to meaning.\nThis isn't about abandoning measurement but about seeing with both eyes:\n\nOne eye for metrics and frameworks\nOne eye for direct quality recognition\nBoth needed for depth perception\n\nThe Nature of Real Authority\nWhat makes Father Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries so powerful isn't his impact metrics - it's the simple truth when he says \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability; it's revealing a different kind of authority that comes from authentic relationship rather than constructed impact.\nA Different Kind of Story\nWe've learned that social enterprises need more than problem-solution narratives. They need stories that:\n\nEmerge from real meaning\nEvolve organically\nConnect specifically to sources of meaning\nCreate natural resonance\n\nWhen entrepreneurs connect with their true sources of meaning, they naturally:\n\nAttract aligned resources\nBuild authentic relationships\nCreate lasting impact\nEnable natural growth\n\nThe Path Forward\nThis suggests a fundamental shift in how we support social impact:\n\nFrom constructing impact to recognizing beauty\nFrom forcing growth to enabling emergence\nFrom measuring change to embodying meaning\nFrom doing good to being alive\n\n\nThree questions for developing Part II:\n\nHow specifically does this capacity for quality recognition develop? Can you share examples of entrepreneurs discovering/trusting it?\nWhat makes this different from \"following your heart\" or \"trusting intuition\"? What gives it reliability?\nWhat blocks access to this faculty, especially in social impact work? What helps clear these blocks?\n\nBefore moving forward, some potential critiques to address:\n\nCould seem too abstract/impractical\nMight appear to dismiss importance of metrics\nCould be seen as privileging feeling over evidence\nMight not address practical constraints\n\nWould you like to:\n\nAddress any of these critiques?\nAnswer the questions for Part II?\nRefine Part I further?\n\nThe key is maintaining both practical relevance and depth while showing how this shift could transform social impact work."

And maybe relatedly, we can talk about craft. And, you know, whether they're traditionally seen as jobs that are not meaningful because Manufacturing and meaningful jobs are all about jobs of the mind, but how that might not necessarily be the case. And then let's see if we can orient around these ideas of doing the right thing also means that the world is more beautiful. Not that just just financial. Sustainability, but then, like, you look at the inward and the outward is you get You know? Like, you want social impact. You want environmental stewardship and sustainability, but if you look within guess without something like\nYes - let's explore how meaning can emerge in supposedly \"mundane\" work and how inner/outer beauty align. Let me gather examples of organizations that demonstrate this:\n# Beauty in the \"Mundane\": Meaning Through Craft and Care\n\n1. Shinola (Detroit)\nInner Beauty:\n- Revived watchmaking craft in Detroit\n- Trained local workers in high-precision skills\n- Created pride in manufacturing work\n- Every worker signs their work\n\nOuter Impact:\n- Transformed neighborhood economy\n- Proved craft possible in urban renewal\n- Created new narrative for Detroit\n- Quality products last longer, reduce waste\n\nKey Insight: When craft is honored, both makers and community flourish.\n\n2.

San Francisco Zen Center's Tassajara Bakery\nInner Beauty:\n- Bread baking as meditation practice\n- Every loaf made with full presence\n- Work practice as spiritual training\n- Craft as path to meaning\n\nOuter Impact:\n- Influenced artisanal food movement\n- Created model of mindful business\n- Proved contemplative work viable\n- Connected community through food\n\nKey Insight: When work itself becomes practice, meaning emerges naturally.\n\n5. Polyface Farms\nInner Beauty:\n- \"The farm that heals the land\"\n- Every practice aligned with natural patterns\n- Workers develop deep ecological knowledge\n- Farming as craft and calling\n\nOuter Impact:\n- Transformed agricultural practices\n- Proved regenerative farming works\n- Created new farmer training model\n- Demonstrated viable alternative to industrial ag\n\nKey Insight: When inner alignment guides practice, outer healing follows.\n\nCommon Patterns:\n\n1. Craft Creates Meaning\n- Detailed knowledge brings satisfaction\n- Physical work can be contemplative\n- Quality emerges from presence\n- Skills development builds dignity\n\n2. Inner/Outer Alignment\n- Beautiful process creates beautiful results\n- Craft knowledge contains sustainability wisdom\n- Personal meaning creates social benefit\n- Quality naturally reduces waste\n\n3.

You can also pull some counter examples from here and be sure ot not just identify the ideas, themes, quotes, and where to include them. Include them, it's ok if the essay is long:\nReal-World Examples of NGOs and Social Enterprises Adopting Corporate Practices with Harmful Outcomes\n1. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)\nWhat Happened: Microfinance started as a way to provide small loans to marginalized communities, especially women, to foster entrepreneurship and alleviate poverty. However, as microfinance grew, many institutions began adopting corporate practices such as profit-maximizing goals, aggressive repayment schedules, and loan quotas. This led to exploitative practices like high-interest rates, coercion, and even borrower suicides in some countries (e.g., India).\nKey Lesson: By adopting a corporate mindset focused on financial metrics over the well-being of borrowers, MFIs often undermined the very communities they were meant to uplift.\n2. Charity: Profit-Driven \"Efficiency\" in Disaster Relief\nWhat Happened: In the aftermath of disasters (like Haiti's 2010 earthquake), major NGOs adopted corporate metrics like ROI, donor satisfaction, and visible project completion as priorities. This led to rushed housing projects and poorly planned infrastructure that failed to meet long-term needs or respect local input. Billions of dollars in funding were spent inefficiently, with a focus on pleasing donors rather than building resilient communities.\nKey Lesson: A corporate efficiency mindset that prioritizes measurable outputs over holistic, community-driven outcomes can lead to waste and harm.\n3. Fair Trade's \"Certification Industrial Complex\"\nWhat Happened: The Fair Trade movement started as a way to ensure small farmers received a fair price for their products. Over time, as certification became a corporate tool, the focus shifted to scaling and meeting the demands of large companies. This led to small-scale farmers being excluded from certification schemes due to high costs, and large plantations dominating \"Fair Trade\" markets while still exploiting workers.\nKey Lesson: Adopting a corporate growth mindset can distort the original intention of movements meant to prioritize equity and justice.\n4. Nonprofit \"Professionalization\" and Burnout\nWhat Happened: Many nonprofits have adopted corporate-style hierarchies, productivity measures, and performance-based evaluations to attract funders or improve efficiency. However, this has led to high turnover, employee burnout, and mission drift, as workers feel dehumanized and alienated in organizations meant to be centered on care and social good.\nExample: NGOs like Oxfam and Save the Children have faced scandals where internal cultures mirrored exploitative corporate environments—fostering toxicity, harassment, and ignoring staff well-being.\nKey Lesson: Professionalizing nonprofits by mimicking corporate cultures often ignores the emotional and relational labor required to achieve social missions.\n5. Education Startups and \"Datafication\"\nWhat Happened: EdTech companies and educational NGOs often adopted corporate-style metrics to measure success (e.g., test scores, student performance data). In doing so, they shifted focus from holistic education to data collection and analytics, reducing students to numbers. Programs that aimed to empower students became tools to reinforce standardization and control.\nExample: Bridge International Academies (an NGO-backed for-profit education model) has been criticized for scripted lessons that disempower teachers and rigid metrics that ignore local needs.\nKey Lesson: A corporate mindset of standardization and efficiency clashes with the nuanced, relational work of education.\nMetaphors for Why This Happens\n\"Wearing a New Mask on the Same Face\"\n\nSocial enterprises often adopt the appearance of change (ethical branding, \"impact metrics\") but don’t address the deeper worldview of competition, hierarchy, and control that governs their operations.\n\"Pouring Clean Water into a Dirty Cup\"\n\nA clean and noble idea (e.g., empowering communities) can be tainted when poured into systems designed for extraction and domination. Unless we change the container (our underlying mindset and structures), the result will always be compromised.\n\"Trying to Grow Organic Food in Polluted Soil\"\n\nSocial enterprises may start with good intentions, but if they operate within \"polluted soil\" (systems that reward exploitation and competition), they inherit the toxicity of their environment and cannot thrive.\n\"Teaching Wolves to Herd Sheep\"\n\nTaking corporate best practices (rooted in competitive and extractive principles) and applying them to social enterprises is like teaching wolves to herd sheep: the nature of the system inherently conflicts with the goal.\n\"Upgrading the Chains of a Prison\"\n\nMaking systems more \"efficient\" or \"ethical\" without questioning their fundamental purpose is like replacing the chains in a prison with silk ropes—it might feel better, but it’s still a prison.\nWhy \"Doing Things Differently\" Matters\nThe core insight here is that we cannot use the same worldview that created the problem to solve it. Social enterprises need to:\n\nShift from efficiency to relationship: Efficiency focuses on outputs, while relationships build trust and lasting change.\nReplace competition with cooperation: Moving away from zero-sum thinking to models that value shared growth.\nValue process as much as outcome: Focusing not just on what is done, but how it is done.\nRedefine success: Moving from financial or numerical metrics to metrics of well-being, equity, and ecological balance.\nWould you like help refining a metaphor or crafting a narrative to convey this to social enterprises? Perhaps a story or a parable that illustrates the deeper need for mindset shifts?\n\n16:31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nyeah, can you also get me quotes and turns of phrase from different cultures that say something like this. maybe something that's actually really simple and clear too so i can share it and people can understand \n16:32\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s a collection of metaphors, proverbs, and quotes from various cultures that express the idea that how we do something shapes the results we get, along with their cultural roots. These can help communicate your message in a simple and relatable way:\n\nQuotes and Proverbs That Align with Your Ideas\n\"The way you make your bed is the way you will sleep.\"\n\n(African Proverb)\nMeaning: The approach you take determines the experience you have. It's not just the result that matters, but how you prepare for it.\n\"A crooked tree will never yield straight timber.\"\n\n(English Proverb)\nMeaning: If the foundation or approach is flawed, the outcome will carry those flaws.\n\"As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.\"\n\n(English Proverb)\nMeaning: The way you shape something from the start affects its entire growth or trajectory.\n\"If you cut corners, you'll build a round house.\"\n\n(Caribbean Saying)\nMeaning: Shortcuts or compromises in how you work lead to imperfect or ineffective results.\n\"The water takes the shape of the vessel it fills.\"\n\n(Chinese Proverb)\nMeaning: The nature of the container (mindset or system) defines the outcome, no matter the quality of the content (ideas or intentions).\n\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"\n\n(English Saying)\nMeaning: Even well-meaning actions can cause harm if they are not guided by the right mindset and values.\n\"You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.\"\n\n(English Proverb)\nMeaning: High-quality results cannot come from low-quality methods or materials.\n\"A rotten fish spoils the whole pot.\"\n\n(Indian Proverb)\nMeaning: A single flaw in the foundation can ruin the entire outcome.\n\"The spirit in which you give is more important than the gift itself.\"\n\n(African Proverb)\nMeaning: The intent and way you act determine the true value of your actions.\n\"One cannot plant weeds and hope for wheat.\"\n\n(Middle Eastern Proverb)\nMeaning: The seeds you sow (methods, intentions) determine the harvest.\n\"The pot leaks from where it was poorly sealed.\"\n(Turkish Proverb)\nMeaning: Weak points in the process or system will ultimately lead to failure.\n\"If the root is rotten, the fruit cannot be sweet.\"\n(Chinese Proverb)\nMeaning: A system built on faulty principles will produce flawed outcomes.\n\"You cannot wash blood with blood.\"\n(Indian Proverb)\nMeaning: Using the same destructive methods or mindset to solve a problem only perpetuates harm.\nModern and Philosophical Quotes\n\"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.\"\n\n(Albert Einstein)\nMeaning: A new mindset is essential for meaningful change.\n\"The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.\"\n\n(Martin Luther King Jr.)\nMeaning: The process matters as much as the goal; methods that harm cannot lead to justice.\n\"What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.\"\n\n(Ralph Waldo Emerson)\nMeaning: Actions—and the way we take them—define outcomes far more than intentions.\n\"You cannot use fire to put out fire.\"\n\n(Buddhist Teaching)\nMeaning: Using the same destructive mindset to address problems only escalates them.\n\"Be the change that you wish to see in the world.\"\n\n(Mahatma Gandhi)\nMeaning: Aligning actions with values is critical; how we act shapes the outcomes.\n\"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.\"\n\n(Audre Lorde)\nMeaning: Systems of oppression cannot be reformed with the same tools or mindset that created them.\nSimple and Clear Sayings to Share\n\"You can’t fix a broken system with broken tools.\"\n\"How we walk the path shapes where it leads.\"\n\"What you build reflects how you build it.\"\n\"You can’t grow flowers in poisoned soil.\"\n\"Better maps don’t help if you’re heading in the wrong direction.\"\nStory-Based Metaphors\nThe Poisoned Well\n\nImagine a village whose well becomes poisoned. Instead of replacing the well or finding clean water, the villagers filter the poisoned water through finer and finer sieves, improving its taste but not its health. No matter how good the filtration, the poison remains. This is like trying to make businesses \"better\" without changing the worldview that poisons them.\nThe Broken Compass\n\nA group of travelers keeps getting lost. They try walking faster, carrying more supplies, and even building better shoes, but they never realize their compass is broken. This is like adopting corporate efficiency without questioning the values guiding the work.\nThe Rusty Hammer\n\nA carpenter keeps using a rusty hammer to build houses. No matter how skilled they are, the hammer always leaves nails bent and the wood damaged. It’s not their skill that’s lacking—it’s the tool they refuse to replace. This is like clinging to outdated corporate values in social enterprises.\nWould you like to explore one of these ideas or refine them for your specific audience? I can also help you adapt them into a cohesive message for presentations or conversations!\n\n16:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you give me more examples of \"doing good gone wrong - because of neoliberal mindsets of extraction disconnection acceleration, etc\"\n16:39\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere are more examples of well-intentioned \"doing good\" efforts that went wrong due to the underlying neoliberal mindset of extraction, disconnection, and acceleration. These illustrate how adopting corporate logic, without questioning its values, often leads to unintended harm:\n\n1. Social Impact Startups in Africa (e.g., One Laptop Per Child)\nWhat Happened: The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program aimed to provide affordable laptops to children in developing countries, believing access to technology would bridge the education gap. However, the program focused on distributing hardware without addressing the local context—schools lacked infrastructure, teachers weren’t trained, and there was no plan to integrate laptops into the curriculum. Many laptops were abandoned or misused.\nThe Problem: The initiative adopted a \"tech-savior\" mindset, focusing on acceleration and scalability without understanding the local systems or fostering connection with communities.\nLesson: Doing good requires slowing down to build relationships and understand real needs, not just imposing top-down solutions.\n2. Carbon Offsetting Programs\nWhat Happened: Many companies and NGOs offer carbon offset programs to reduce the environmental impact of industries. These often involve planting trees or funding renewable energy projects. However, these programs are frequently used to justify continued emissions (greenwashing), and many tree-planting projects fail due to poor planning or lack of follow-up, leading to degraded ecosystems.\nThe Problem: The neoliberal logic of \"offsetting\" turns sustainability into a transactional system rather than addressing root causes of overconsumption and industrial emissions.\nLesson: Genuine sustainability cannot be achieved through compensatory mechanisms alone; it requires systemic change.\n3. \"Green Revolution\" in Agriculture\nWhat Happened: The Green Revolution in the mid-20th century introduced high-yield crops, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to combat global hunger. While it increased food production, it also led to soil degradation, water scarcity, and dependency on chemical inputs. Small farmers were often driven into debt by the costs of seeds and chemicals, deepening inequality.\nThe Problem: The logic of extraction and acceleration—focusing on maximizing output without considering long-term ecological or social impacts—undermined the goals of sustainability and equity.\nLesson: Approaches that prioritize short-term efficiency over holistic well-being often create more harm than good.\n4. Fast Fashion and \"Conscious\" Collections\nWhat Happened: Companies like H&M introduced \"conscious\" collections to promote sustainability in the fashion industry. However, these collections make up a tiny fraction of their output, while the overall business model remains based on overproduction, low wages, and disposable clothing. The marketing of these collections gives consumers a false sense of doing good while perpetuating exploitative practices.\nThe Problem: Neoliberal capitalism’s drive for growth and speed clashes with the slower, more connected processes required for genuine sustainability.\nLesson: Without addressing the root problem—overproduction and exploitation—efforts to \"do good\" become performative.\n5. Volunteer Tourism (\"Voluntourism\")\nWhat Happened: Volunteer tourism offers travelers the chance to help disadvantaged communities while vacationing. However, many programs focus on providing feel-good experiences for volunteers rather than creating sustainable change. For instance, volunteers might build schools that later remain empty because no teachers are hired or trained.\nThe Problem: The disconnection between volunteers and the communities they serve—paired with an extractive, profit-driven tourism model—turns \"helping\" into a commodity that benefits volunteers more than locals.\nLesson: True change requires deep, sustained relationships and co-created solutions, not transactional acts of \"help.\"\n6. NGOs Perpetuating Dependency\nWhat Happened: Many humanitarian aid organizations unintentionally foster long-term dependency by providing relief without investing in community-driven solutions. For example, constant food aid in some regions has disrupted local agricultural markets, making it harder for farmers to compete.\nThe Problem: A mindset of disconnection and top-down \"rescue\" treats communities as passive recipients rather than active participants, undermining self-sufficiency.\nLesson: Social enterprises and NGOs must shift from paternalism to partnership, fostering empowerment rather than dependency.\n7. Plastic Recycling Initiatives\nWhat Happened: Global plastic recycling campaigns have emphasized individual responsibility for waste while failing to address the systemic problem of overproduction by corporations. Studies show that only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, yet the focus remains on consumers to \"do their part.\"\nThe Problem: The neoliberal mindset offloads responsibility onto individuals, disconnecting systemic accountability (corporations) from the problem of plastic pollution.\nLesson: Environmental initiatives must challenge corporate production patterns rather than placing the burden on consumers.\n8. Corporate \"Diversity and Inclusion\" Programs\nWhat Happened: Many companies implement diversity and inclusion programs to address workplace inequities. However, these programs are often surface-level, focusing on optics rather than structural change. For example, hiring more diverse employees without addressing toxic workplace cultures leads to high turnover among underrepresented groups.\nThe Problem: The mindset of acceleration and optics treats diversity as a checkbox rather than a systemic transformation.\nLesson: Equity requires slow, deliberate shifts in culture and power, not quick-fix programs.\n9. The Privatization of Public Services\nWhat Happened: Under neoliberal reforms, public services like water, education, and healthcare have been privatized in many countries, often with promises of increased efficiency. In reality, privatization has often led to reduced access, higher costs, and worsening inequality, especially in vulnerable communities.\nThe Problem: Applying corporate logic to essential services treats people as customers rather than citizens with rights, prioritizing profit over access and equity.\nLesson: Public goods cannot be treated as market commodities without undermining their purpose.\n10. Tech in the Classroom: Overuse of EdTech\nWhat Happened: Many schools adopted digital learning tools to \"modernize\" education, often driven by tech companies rather than educators. These tools frequently prioritized data collection and standardization over meaningful learning. Studies show that excessive screen use can harm students’ focus and engagement while deepening digital divides for low-income schools.\nThe Problem: The acceleration mindset prioritizes technological solutions over understanding human learning processes, resulting in harm to students.\nLesson: Technology should serve human needs, not dictate them.\nKey Patterns in \"Doing Good Gone Wrong\"\nAcross these examples, the underlying neoliberal mindsets lead to:\n\nDisconnection – Treating people and ecosystems as resources or beneficiaries rather than partners or equals.\nExtraction – Prioritizing measurable outputs (profits, metrics, growth) over relational or long-term well-being.\nAcceleration – Seeking quick fixes or scalable models instead of slower, context-specific, relational solutions.\nWould you like to explore any of these stories in greater detail, or craft a narrative or metaphor to help explain this to your audience?"

Instead of minimizing liability or protecting the brand - the \"smart\" business move - CEO Hamdi Ulukaya chose radical transparency and put customer wellbeing first. The result wasn't just survival but deeper trust and stronger community bonds.\n\nThis choice illuminates a fundamental tension in social impact work: the gap between good intentions and how we try to achieve them. Consider what happened with microfinance - an innovation meant to empower marginalized communities through small loans. As it grew, many institutions adopted corporate practices: aggressive repayment schedules, loan quotas, profit maximization. The tragic result? A wave of borrower suicides in India, the very communities these programs meant to serve.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Good Intentions] -->|Corporate Mindset| B[Extraction/Control]\n    A -->|Quality Recognition| C[Beauty/Emergence]\n    B -->|Results in| D[Unintended Harm]\n    C -->|Enables| E[Natural Flourishing]\n    F[Crisis/Challenge] -->|Reveals| G[True Values]\n```\n\n## The Poisoned Well\n\nAs the African proverb warns, \"You cannot wash blood with blood.\" Yet in social impact, we keep trying to solve problems using the same mindset that created them.

Organizations like Buurtzorg in healthcare show what's possible when we trust human capacity for direct quality recognition:\n- Nurses make decisions based on patient relationships, not protocols\n- Communities self-organize rather than follow top-down management\n- Quality of care improves while costs decrease\n- Natural scale emerges through trust\n\nThis isn't just nice theory - it works at scale.

Or Morning Star, proving direct relationships work better than management hierarchies even in traditional manufacturing.\n\n## Beyond Best Practices\n\nI learned this lesson painfully at Bloom. Initially, our approach made perfect sense: validate assessments, unify impact metrics, track progress across programs.
