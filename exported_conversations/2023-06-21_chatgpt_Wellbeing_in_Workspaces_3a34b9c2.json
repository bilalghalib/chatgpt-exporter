It's a continuous process adapted based on unique needs and challenges of stakeholders and environment. Wellbeing can be individual or collective (various contributors including Milia, Sarah, Annie, Rim, Dara, Aya, Rida, Munir, Peter, Dima).\n\n2. **Managing Stress**\n    - Stress is prevalent across organizations of all sizes, with workload being the primary stressor. Strategies for stress management include time management, prioritizing health, mental health, and financial health, setting boundaries and maintaining a clear work-life balance. Important to acknowledge how mental stress can manifest physically (Dr. Sarah Makhoul, Annie Seferian, Mohammed Alafifi, Aya JYIF).\n\n3. **Work-Life Balance and Boundaries**\n    - Setting clear boundaries for work hours and ensuring rest periods are respected is vital. Panelists shared strategies such as time-blocking, prioritizing tasks, and maintaining open communication about individual needs and limitations (Annie Seferian, Mohammed Alafifi, Rim, Mohammed/Layal).\n\n4. **Employee Engagement and Support**\n    - An engaged and supported workforce is more productive and satisfied. Strategies include fostering a culture of collaboration and adaptability, encouraging personal and professional development, aligning personal and organizational vision, and providing constructive feedback (Annie Seferian, Mohammed/Layal, Aya, Peter Abdel Karim).\n\n5. **Promoting Personal and Professional Development**\n    - Encouraging employees to pursue their personal and professional development goals. Recognition of universal skills and offering opportunities for continuous learning are beneficial (Aya, Mohammed/Layal).\n\n6. **Values and Beliefs**\n    - Aligning work with personal values and beliefs contributes significantly to job satisfaction. Pro-bono projects often generate immense satisfaction due to their direct community impact (Layal, BG, Mohammed Sikka).\n\n7. **Wellbeing in Business vs. NGOs**\n    - The distinction between wellbeing in business organizations vs. NGOs was discussed.
