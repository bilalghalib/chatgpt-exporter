We are working to integrate green, sustainability and climate resilient concepts into a standard business accelerator and training program, we’re doing it by updating the slide presentations and creating worksheets. We are trying to keep it broad enough to be helpful for every participant, and integrate green/sustainability concepts through methods that everyone benefits from: risk mitigation, efficiency, and a focus on values. \nI would like you to help me demonstrate the changes and explain what we did to our client by summarizing the original content, the new content and highlighting the key changes that helped to \"Green\" their curriculum: here is presented  two sets of materials for each module: Original Content and Updated Content.\n\n1. Review the Original Content for each module as a whole. Summarize how it was organized and what it covered.\n2. Review the Updated Content for each module. Summarize how it is organized now and what it covers.\n3. Provide a concise “Reason for Change” or big-picture explanation of why the content was updated.\n\n\n\nPlease be thorough yet concise. Focus on high-level differences and the overarching purpose for each update.

What is the benefit of that?\nPotential answers could be:\nTo know what the users go through while they try to meet their needs.\nMake our business easy and convenient for our customers.\nA customer journey map can help you build empathy towards your users as you try to experience what they go through. \nIt can also uncover insights, such as when you compare journeys between customers to find common threads or find conflicting behaviors within a customer’s journey.\nIt is a way to find new opportunities that we can implement for our business\n“A successful customer journey map will give you real insight into what your customers want and any parts of your product, brand or process that aren’t delivering.”\n3\n\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\n\n\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nScenario: Situation of need\nPersona Objectives:\nPic:\n\n\nDemographics:\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStory board pic\n\nStep 1\nStep 2\nStep 3\nStep 4\nStep 5\nGoals & Behavior\nEmotions & Thoughts\nSolutions & opportunities\nCUSTOMER JOURNEY MAP\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nReview CJM tool\nThis is the tool that you all used during Ignite, so I hope it is familiar to you. \nAs you all mentioned earlier, you can see a big focus identifying the actual behaviors of customers. For each step a customer has a specific goal in mind. With each step emotions come up as well. Maybe they are excited, happy, or even frustrated with the process. We use this information to as a way to identify new opportunities that will make things better for our customers/user.\nWe have already done this based on your customers experience without your competitors business, now we will try and map out what their experience would be with YOUR product or service. \nWe are going to start with what is called “happy path”, which is focusing just on the steps (the highlighted part on the slide) your user/customer will take to successfully accomplish a goal (make a purchase for example). \nWe don’t know the emotions and behaviors of our customers with our product yet because we haven’t developed and tested it yet. Therefore we are only focusing on the steps. We will create the whole CJM for our business as be begin to prototype and develop more!\n\n\n\nDraw a happy path for a greengrocer shop with a goal to serve orders really fast!\nHAPPY PATH:\n10-15 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nBrainstorm: So lets do an example of this together. Lets imagine we are a green grocer shop. Our main value that differentiates ourselves from our competitors is that we serve our customers very quickly. Now lets design the happy path for our customers. Again, the happy path is the journey the customer would take to successfully complete their goal.\n\nAsk: What do you suggest? What are the steps our customers should go through to buy fresh fruit and vegetables from? \nWrite the happy path out on white board or on a Jamboard.\nPeople might answer something like this:\nListing what they need to purchase from our store\nCustomer thinks about which store to go to so they can get their groceries\nGo to our store\nEnter the store and explore it\nEvaluate the quality of produce\nPut food into your basket\nGo to check out and pay\nRequest delivery\nEtc…\n\nTrainer tips:\nMake sure to manage the board in a way to make sure the steps happen in the right order, even though people might make suggestions out of order.\nPeople might want to talk about what the business should be doing and how to run the business. Write these points on the side as ideas, but make sure to focus on the steps of the customer.\nAn entrepreneur might want to point out that the customer isn’t happy and leaves without purchasing, or maybe gets distracted by something. In that case point out that it is important to construct alternative user experiences to allow for “not happy” path journeys, but that is not our focus today. Assume they go to purchase.\n\nAsk: Why do we make this?\nWe do this to get a clear picture of your business and the journey of your customers in an obvious way. \nClarity on what is most important and what you should be doing\nFocus on Prioritize the key point of value when developing business\nSimplify and have a visual description\nWe need to start here to frame the rest of the incubator. This will be helpful when we get into prototyping as well and developing an MVP.\n\n5\n\nHAPPY PATH:\nDraw a happy path for a greengrocer shop with a goal to serve orders really fast!\nPark the car\nPick up \npre-filled packages\nPlace package on register\nPay money\nPut items in your car\nOpen the app\nAdd items to basket\nConfirm purchase request\nSelect payment method\nSelect delivery method\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\n5 minutes: Example\nAs you remember from Ignite, not all of our customers are the same. We have different personas representing groups of people with different needs. Remember my goal is to be fast and convenient. I always keep this value proposition in mind!\n\nOne happy path that I designed looks like this (show first row). This is a persona who likes to go to the store.\nThe first step here is that customers park their cars. \nIn order to make it fast, I made pre-filled packages that customers can just pick up without going around the store\nThen they go to the register and pay\nFinally they go to their car.\n\nMy second persona is someone who likes to use technology. Therefore I made an app for them. (show second happy path)\nThe journey with my app looks like:\nOpen the app\nAdd needed items to the basket\nConfirm order request\nSend payment method\nSelect delivery method (pick up in store or delivery)\nReceive fresh food to your door.\nYou can point out that there might be actions missing such as “browse items” before you add them to the cart. You want to be simple, but also comprehensive and include all the actions.\n\nRecap: \nFor each of these steps, if I see that customers will take a lot of effort to do it, I should consider changing it to something else or cutting out the step if possible.\nIn each step, I am talking about the steps my customer is taking. It is not from the perspective of the business.\nI considered my personas needs. These journeys were made based off of the user research that I did and the needs I found! \n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: “why we should do this? Why we should focus on designing the user experience with such care? (this leads us to the next slide).\nPotential answers can be: \nWe do this to get a clear picture of how your customers experience your business in a highly obvious way.\nSimplify everything in your head and have a visual description,\nWe want clarity on what is most important and what your customers end goal is (making a sale, signing up, or something else),\nWe need to start here to frame the rest of the incubator. This will be helpful when we get into prototyping as well and developing an MVP.\n\n6\n\nWHAT IS THE GOAL?\nTo deliver value and make sales \n+\n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nRecap: \nThere are both user goals and business goals that need to be considered! A great entrepreneur is able to align these 2 goals in a successful way! \nAlthough a happy path may seem very simple and mater of fact, it is essential to create a business model that you and your customers benefit from. This is all rooted in our customers needs and emotions. \nDo NOT forget about your Unique Value Proposition! We have spent so much time looking at the market and seeing where the we can really add value to our customers, we need to develop our product to meet those needs. \nAlthough you might have many great features and elements of your business, we want to focus on and prioritize the key point of value (UVP) when developing your business. Remember we are offering value to make sales (or another business goal)!\nTime and time again, when an entrepreneur interacts with investors, mentors, judges, or other business people, the most consistent feedback is that the UVP is unclear! Highlight it!\nNever forget about your UVP! \n\n\n\n7\n\nFOCUS ON THE STEPS:\n\n1. Identify the most important,      singular goal of your business.\n\n2. Start each step with an action verb.\n\n3. |Review to see which steps might cause sales to decrease.\n\n5 minutes: Lecture \n\nSo how will we create our happy paths? It is easy:\nIdentify most important, singular goal of your business. Identify your purpose. There has to be a purpose/goal at the end of the happy path. This is probably you getting paid for the key value you delivered. Each feature of your product should contribute to that one goal in some way!\n\nStart with an action verb. Every step of your happy path should be very clear and start with an action verb. What is the action that your customer does at this step to get them closer to the promise of value that your business is offering?\n\nReview to see which steps might cause sales to decrease? After you do those 2 simple steps, take a step back and review it. Are these steps simple and easy for your customer to get to the end and benefit from your product/service? How can you improve it?\n\nLet’s do an example together to clarify the steps.\n\n8\n\nTHE “HAPPY PATH”: TOURISM AGENCY\nDraw the happy path and describe the experience of your personas who are for the first time buying and using your product or service!\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nSo here is an example of a tourism agency. \nFor this business we drew this happy path. \nTrainer should briefly go through the points on the happy path. \nAsk: What do you guys think of this? Does each step make the process easier, or harder for the customers? \nPotential answers could be: \nIt is long\nThere are a few unnecessary steps\nMost people don’t want to wait for more information, they want it right away\nI don’t want to pay in an office for an online service!\nEtc… \n\n9\n\nTHE NOT SO “HAPPY PATH”\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nHappiness\nTime\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nCan someone tell me what they think this is? What happened?\nPotential answers can be: \nIt is a CJM gone wrong\nIt is a happy path with many steps and started to take too long\nSteps 5, 6, and 7 weren’t working well and bothered the user causing a negative customers experience\nIt wasn’t designed for the customer!\nIt is taking a lot of time for the person to get to the end.\nWhich steps aren’t in line with customers? Which steps make them leave or unhappy?\n\nRecap: If there is a step that isn’t working well, it will cause our customers to get frustrated and maybe go to another solution. In reality many customers are not ready to convert they may get distracted by other features of your business. They might drop out of the journey completely and leave the site. You should think critically about your customers journey to make sure that it is clear and simple for them. Many times we only think about the end goal of our customer, but ignore the steps they take to get there. Your solution should be designed with their needs in mind.\n\n\n\n10\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n30 minutes: Activity\n\nSo, keeping in mind that our customers are getting frustrated with our previous happy path, we will make a new one!\nAsk: Does anybody remember the first step to making a happy path? \nIdentify most important, singular goal of your product\nFirst, we have to remember what our promise of value is! In this case, it is convenience of booking and a fair price. Remembering that my customers care most about convenience and price, how should I remodel my business happy path? \n\n25 minutes: Activity\n15 minutes: Group work\nGet into small groups and discuss how we can make sure that this happy path is in line with the promise of value to our customers (which is convenience of booking and price).\nGo where you are comfortable and create a new happy path.\n10 minutes: Share\nCome back to the big group and have the groups share.\nMake sure that the path is staying on point, doesn’t deviate to other features, and doesn’t have any unnecessary steps. \n11\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n3 minutes: Recap \n\nHere is an example of how I shortened the happy path. \nFirst I wrote out my main goal. I need to always remember that my customers care most about convenience and price\nNext, I looked through what I had and I highlighted all the unnecessary steps or things that made it more inconvenient or expensive. I will cut these out!\nKeep in mind that when you change something on here, it will be reflected in your whole business model and how you operate. Think about the effect changes will have on both your customers and your business. \nMake sure this happy path has an overall positive affect and is feasible!\n\n12\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nBrowse tours\nClick on tour\nView details\nBook tour\nPay by credit card\nReceive confirmation email\nAfter sales support\n3 minutes: Recap continued\n\nHere is an example of how I shortened the happy path. \nAfter highlighting the parts that weren’t suitable for my customers, I removed them or replaced them with other, more convenient, steps. \nI cut extra steps out\nI changed the payment method\nI will also save money by automating processes and having less staff. I can transfer this value to the customers (by lowering my price for example) or keep it myself (as more profit).\n\nRecap: Just because this is what I designed right now doesn’t mean I should keep it this way. I have to show it to people and test it with my customers to see if it is right, and find ways to improve. Don’t be stuck on your idea! Be open to changing and adjusting things!\n\n\n13\n\nCREATE YOUR HAPPY PATH! – 25 MINUTES\nIdentify the most important, singular goal of your business? \n2. Start each step with an action  verb.\n3. .Review to see which steps\n    .might cause sales to decrease.\n50 minutes: Activity\n\nNow, we will take some time for all of you to make a happy path of your own. Remember, this activity is to lay out all of the steps that your customers would take to accomplish their goals. If we think about CJM, it includes before during and after!\nBefore: First learning about your product and interacting with it\nDuring: Going through your products/services and choosing to purchase (in here, we put our positive expectation on paper about the relation between product and user)!\nAfter: Any follow up activities that the customer will do\n\n25 minutes: Activity\nIndividual work on their businesses to create their happy path. Some businesses might be multi-sided, leading to more than 1 happy path. Focus on 1 side for now, and do the other one later today.\nUse flipchart paper or something that will be easy to share your work with others. If you are working online, there is a digital version that entrepreneurs can use as a template.\nMake sure you clearly write your UVP at the top and the end goal of your business (make a purchase, download, subscribe, etc…)\nStart with an action that your customer will take\nTrainers should be walking around during this time to help entrepreneurs and answer questions\n\n15 minutes: Post and share\nEntrepreneurs should post their happy paths around the room \nEveryone will get post it notes and provide feedback on each others happy paths.\nIs the path clear and easy for users?\nDoes it accomplish the end goals of the business and customer?\nDo you have any suggestions to improve it?\nIf it is online, entrepreneurs will go into breakout rooms as small groups to share their work and get feedback\n\n10 minutes: Recap\nBring everyone back into the room to discuss.\nAsk: How was it, what did you learn? \n\n14\n\nALTERNATIVE PATHS\nCreating a workflow\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nVisit the blog\nView gallery\nComment on photo\nBrowse tours\nClick on tour\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nNow, you guys just did the “happy path”. This is the customer successfully completing the transaction in the simplest of forms.\nHowever, you need to remember that your business has alternative paths as well. \nYou have a path to register, a path to change settings, etc… \nIf you are a more traditional business, maybe you don’t go right to check out. You walk around, you can add or remove things to your cart, compare items, you might ask for help from the front desk, etc… \nSome of these alternative paths lead to customers dropping off and leaving.\nOnce you have a very clear happy path, start to add more detail and build out your whole workflow. \nTry to keep all the “paths” clean and simple\nMake sure that the alternative paths lead back to the end goal of “make a purchase” (or likewise)\nMake sure that users understand where they are, and where they can go, at all times (especially true for applications/websites).\nJust because it looks simple, doesn’t mean it is! Make sure to run your personas through these paths. \n\nAsk: Why is this important to do?\nWe will use this as a starting point for some other sessions.\nTech businesses: \nThis is an essential step for applications. You will use these workflows as a starting point for our wireframes. If you have clear workflows that you hand over to your developer, you can negotiate a cheaper price. This is one of the most difficult parts to get right!\nNon-tech businesses: \nWe will use these workflows to ensure that we are creating a great user experience for customers. Making sure that processes are simple and user friendly!\n\n15\n\nOUR DESIGN JOURNEY\nValue Proposition\nWorkflow Architecture\nProduct Layout\nUI\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nThis is the first step in a series of steps that will lead us to a perfectly designed product for our customers!\nTrainer should go over each step and explain how we will do it:\nValue proposition: This should be at the forethought of the entrepreneurs minds at all times. All of the other components are built upon delivering value to the customers. We did this during Ignite, and touched on it again today. \nBusiness processes: How does the user interact with your product day to day? What are the actions they take to get the value delivered to them? Again, we started this today through the happy path, but you should go deeper by defining the alternative journeys as well. \nProduct layout: Once we know what we are trying to deliver and the user flow, we must define how users will interact with your business. What does the user do at each step? How do they interact with your actual product? How do they physically navigate through their whole journey? We will spend a lot of time on this when we begin to prototype and test! \nUI: What does the user see? What designs are visible? Color and font schemes are determined to make the product visually appealing. This is the last step. It doesn’t matter if your product looks nice if the user doesn’t have a good experience achieving their goal. \n16\n\nOUR DESIGN JOURNEY\nValue Proposition\nWorkflow Architecture\nProduct Layout\nUI\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nWe have already started! These steps are critical to creating a strong foundation for the rest of our design. Make sure that you spend the next week working on these two parts. We will look at them next Sunday!\n17\n\nBECAUSE…\nGOOD DESIGN \nGOOD BUSINESS\n=\n3 minutes: Lecture \n\nRemember, Good design = Good business\nWhen you are thinking of your customers as you design your product, you are developing a good business. A good business is one that is sustainable, profitable, and has clear competitive advantage (among other things). \nThis is the design of your actual product/service, but also the design of your business (HOW your customer gets and pays for it).\nNext session we will dive into the BMC where we will look at all the different elements of your business. Every single part of your business needs to be designed thoughtfully to make sure that you are able to deliver that promised value to your customers.\n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nAdd workflows to your “happy path” of your business and do a peer review. \n\nMake sure that your designs are really solving your customers problems!\n\nDue next Sunday!\n\n\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTrainer note: Some businesses might have a multi-sided business model (marketplaces for instance). Ask the entrepreneurs who have more than 1 happy path to do this for each side of their business.\n19\n\nTHANKS\n\nANY QUESTIONS?\n20 ]]]\n\n[[[UPDATED COPY OF INTRO TO UX\nINTRO TO UX\n----\nAgenda\n----\n9:00 | Settle in\n9:15 | CJM recap\n9:30 | Group example (green grocer)\n10:00 | Break\n10:15 | Practical group activity\n10:55 | Practical application + feedback\n11:55 - 12:00 | Wrap up\n----\n\n9:00 | Settle in\nTea/coffee\nSpeak with the entrepreneurs\n\n9:15 | Begin the session\nGood morning everyone!

This will be helpful when we get into prototyping as well and developing an MVP.\n\n5\n\nHAPPY PATH:\nDraw a happy path for a greengrocer shop with a goal to serve orders really fast!\nPark the car\nPick up \npre-filled packages\nPlace package on register\nPay money\nPut items in your car\nOpen the app\nAdd items to basket\nConfirm purchase request\nSelect payment method\nSelect delivery method\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\n5 minutes: Example\nAs you remember from Ignite, not all of our customers are the same. We have different personas representing groups of people with different needs. Remember my goal is to be fast and convenient. I always keep this value proposition in mind!\n\nOne happy path that I designed looks like this (show first row). This is a persona who likes to go to the store.\nThe first step here is that customers park their cars. \nIn order to make it fast, I made pre-filled packages that customers can just pick up without going around the store\nThen they go to the register and pay\nFinally they go to their car.\n\nMy second persona is someone who likes to use technology. Therefore I made an app for them. (show second happy path)\nThe journey with my app looks like:\nOpen the app\nAdd needed items to the basket\nConfirm order request\nSend payment method\nSelect delivery method (pick up in store or delivery)\nReceive fresh food to your door.\nYou can point out that there might be actions missing such as “browse items” before you add them to the cart. You want to be simple, but also comprehensive and include all the actions.\n\nRecap: \nFor each of these steps, if I see that customers will take a lot of effort to do it, I should consider changing it to something else or cutting out the step if possible.\nIn each step, I am talking about the steps my customer is taking. It is not from the perspective of the business.\nI considered my personas needs. These journeys were made based off of the user research that I did and the needs I found! \n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nAsk: “why we should do this? Why we should focus on designing the user experience with such care? (this leads us to the next slide).\nPotential answers can be: \nWe do this to get a clear picture of how your customers experience your business in a highly obvious way.\nSimplify everything in your head and have a visual description,\nWe want clarity on what is most important and what your customers end goal is (making a sale, signing up, or something else),\nWe need to start here to frame the rest of the incubator. This will be helpful when we get into prototyping as well and developing an MVP.\n\n6\n\nCustomers are balancing between their needs and their values.\n\nEx: They want their groceries quickly while also limiting pollution.\n\nUnderstanding values opens doors for differentiation and new products and services.\nTHE TRULY HAPPY PATH\nCreating Value Through Values\n10-15 Minutes: Values Discussion\nBrainstorm: What truly makes us happy? Is it just achieving goals, or also the journey and its impact?\nReflect: Think of a regretted purchase—what missing information could have prevented it? How can UX design help customers avoid similar regrets?\nDiscuss: Share examples where you made values-based purchasing decisions. How did it shape your experience?\nApply: How might customer values influence their steps when shopping at our green grocer?\nConsider: Consider a prior purchase you regretted. What tools or info would have helped you make a better decision? (Example: Nutrition labels, fair-trade certifications, price-per-unit comparison.)\nExample 1 (E-commerce): Highlighting most popular vs. most ethical purchasing options.\nExample 2 (Grocery Stores): Stores arranging convenience-based shopping vs. values-based shopping (e.g., organic/local products).\n7\n\nWHAT IS THE GOAL?\nTo deliver value and make sales \n+\n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nRecap: \nThere are both user goals and business goals that need to be considered! A great entrepreneur is able to align these 2 goals in a successful way! \nValue creation happens when customers can both meet their needs AND express their values through their choices\nAsk: How might helping customers make choices aligned with their values increase their loyalty to your business?\nAlthough a happy path may seem very simple and matter of fact, it is essential to create a business model that you and your customers benefit from. This is all rooted in our customers needs and emotions. \nDo NOT forget about your Unique Value Proposition! We have spent so much time looking at the market and seeing where the we can really add value to our customers, we need to develop our product to meet those needs. \nAlthough you might have many great features and elements of your business, we want to focus on and prioritize the key point of value (UVP) when developing your business. Remember we are offering value to make sales (or another business goal)!\nTime and time again, when an entrepreneur interacts with investors, mentors, judges, or other business people, the most consistent feedback is that the UVP is unclear! Highlight it!\nNever forget about your UVP! \n\n\n\n8\n\nFOCUS ON THE STEPS:\n\n1. Identify the most important,      singular goal of your business.\n\n2. Start each step with an action verb.\n\n3. |Review to see which steps might cause sales to decrease.\n\n5 minutes: Lecture \n\nSo how will we create our happy paths? It is easy:\nIdentify most important, singular goal of your business. Identify your purpose. There has to be a purpose/goal at the end of the happy path. This is probably you getting paid for the key value you delivered. Each feature of your product should contribute to that one goal in some way!\n\nStart with an action verb. Every step of your happy path should be very clear and start with an action verb. What is the action that your customer does at this step to get them closer to the promise of value that your business is offering?\n\nReview to see which steps might cause sales to decrease? After you do those 2 simple steps, take a step back and review it. Are these steps simple and easy for your customer to get to the end and benefit from your product/service? How can you improve it?\n\nLet’s do an example together to clarify the steps.\n\n9\n\nTHE “HAPPY PATH”: TOURISM AGENCY\nDraw the happy path and describe the experience of your personas who are for the first time buying and using your product or service!\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nSo here is an example of a tourism agency. \nFor this business we drew this happy path. \nTrainer should briefly go through the points on the happy path. \nAsk: What do you guys think of this? Does each step make the process easier, or harder for the customers? \nPotential answers could be: \nIt is long\nThere are a few unnecessary steps\nMost people don’t want to wait for more information, they want it right away\nI don’t want to pay in an office for an online service!\nEtc… \n\n10\n\nTHE NOT SO “HAPPY PATH”\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nHappiness\nTime\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nCan someone tell me what they think this is? What happened?\nPotential answers can be: \nIt is a CJM gone wrong\nIt is a happy path with many steps and started to take too long\nSteps 5, 6, and 7 weren’t working well and bothered the user causing a negative customers experience\nIt wasn’t designed for the customer!\nIt is taking a lot of time for the person to get to the end.\nWhich steps aren’t in line with customers? Which steps make them leave or unhappy?\n\nRecap: If there is a step that isn’t working well, it will cause our customers to get frustrated and maybe go to another solution. In reality many customers are not ready to convert they may get distracted by other features of your business. They might drop out of the journey completely and leave the site. You should think critically about your customers journey to make sure that it is clear and simple for them. Many times we only think about the end goal of our customer, but ignore the steps they take to get there. Your solution should be designed with their needs in mind.\n\n\n\n11\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n30 minutes: Activity\n\nSo, keeping in mind that our customers are getting frustrated with our previous happy path, we will make a new one!\nAsk: Does anybody remember the first step to making a happy path? \nIdentify most important, singular goal of your product\nFirst, we have to remember what our promise of value is! In this case, it is convenience of booking and a fair price. Remembering that my customers care most about convenience and price, how should I remodel my business happy path? \n\n25 minutes: Activity\n15 minutes: Group work\nGet into small groups and discuss how we can make sure that this happy path is in line with the promise of value to our customers (which is convenience of booking and price).\nGo where you are comfortable and create a new happy path.\n10 minutes: Share\nCome back to the big group and have the groups share.\nMake sure that the path is staying on point, doesn’t deviate to other features, and doesn’t have any unnecessary steps. \n12\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nRequest more information\nWait for an email\nSpeak with sales agent\nNegotiate offer\nBook with sales agent\nReceive confirmation email\nPay in office\nAfter sales support\n3 minutes: Recap \n\nHere is an example of how I shortened the happy path. \nFirst I wrote out my main goal. I need to always remember that my customers care most about convenience and price\nNext, I looked through what I had and I highlighted all the unnecessary steps or things that made it more inconvenient or expensive. I will cut these out!\nKeep in mind that when you change something on here, it will be reflected in your whole business model and how you operate. Think about the effect changes will have on both your customers and your business. \nMake sure this happy path has an overall positive affect and is feasible!\n\n13\n\nREMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE!\nGOAL: \nTo help tourists book a full package trip to Kurdistan in an easy way\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nBrowse eco-friendly tour options\nClick on tour\nView details\nBook tour\nPay by credit card\nReceive confirmation email\nAfter sales support\n3 minutes: Recap continued\n\nHere is an example of how I shortened the happy path. \nAfter highlighting the parts that weren’t suitable for my customers, I removed them or replaced them with other, more convenient, steps. \nI cut extra steps out\nI changed the payment method\nI will also save money by automating processes and having less staff. I can transfer this value to the customers (by lowering my price for example) or keep it myself (as more profit).\n\nRecap: Just because this is what I designed right now doesn’t mean I should keep it this way. I have to show it to people and test it with my customers to see if it is right, and find ways to improve. Don’t be stuck on your idea! Be open to changing and adjusting things!\n\n\n14\n\nCREATE YOUR HAPPY PATH! – 25 MINUTES\nIdentify the most important, singular goal of your business? \n2. Start each step with an action verb.\n3. .Review to see which steps\n    .might cause sales to decrease.\n50 minutes: Activity\n\nNow, we will take some time for all of you to make a happy path of your own. Remember, this activity is to lay out all of the steps that your customers would take to accomplish their goals. If we think about CJM, it includes before during and after!\nBefore: First learning about your product and interacting with it\nDuring: Going through your products/services and choosing to purchase (in here, we put our positive expectation on paper about the relation between product and user)!\nAfter: Any follow up activities that the customer will do\n\n25 minutes: Activity\nIndividual work on their businesses to create their happy path. Some businesses might be multi-sided, leading to more than 1 happy path. Focus on 1 side for now, and do the other one later today.\nUse flipchart paper or something that will be easy to share your work with others. If you are working online, there is a digital version that entrepreneurs can use as a template.\nMake sure you clearly write your UVP at the top and the end goal of your business (make a purchase, download, subscribe, etc…)\nStart with an action that your customer will take\nTrainers should be walking around during this time to help entrepreneurs and answer questions\n\n15 minutes: Post and share\nEntrepreneurs should post their happy paths around the room \nEveryone will get post it notes and provide feedback on each others happy paths.\nIs the path clear and easy for users?\nDoes it accomplish the end goals of the business and customer?\nDo you have any suggestions to improve it?\nIf it is online, entrepreneurs will go into breakout rooms as small groups to share their work and get feedback\n\n10 minutes: Recap\nBring everyone back into the room to discuss.\nAsk: How was it, what did you learn? \n\n15\n\nALTERNATIVE PATHS\nCreating a workflow\nSee ad on social media\nClick on photo\nClick link in bio\nVisit the blog\nView gallery\nComment on photo\nBrowse tours\nClick on tour\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nNow, you guys just did the “happy path”. This is the customer successfully completing the transaction in the simplest of forms.\nHowever, you need to remember that your business has alternative paths as well. \nYou have a path to register, a path to change settings, etc… \nIf you are a more traditional business, maybe you don’t go right to check out. You walk around, you can add or remove things to your cart, compare items, you might ask for help from the front desk, etc… \nSome of these alternative paths lead to customers dropping off and leaving.\nOnce you have a very clear happy path, start to add more detail and build out your whole workflow. \nTry to keep all the “paths” clean and simple\nMake sure that the alternative paths lead back to the end goal of “make a purchase” (or likewise)\nMake sure that users understand where they are, and where they can go, at all times (especially true for applications/websites).\nJust because it looks simple, doesn’t mean it is! Make sure to run your personas through these paths. \n\nAsk: Why is this important to do?\nWe will use this as a starting point for some other sessions.\nTech businesses: \nThis is an essential step for applications. You will use these workflows as a starting point for our wireframes. If you have clear workflows that you hand over to your developer, you can negotiate a cheaper price. This is one of the most difficult parts to get right!\nNon-tech businesses: \nWe will use these workflows to ensure that we are creating a great user experience for customers. Making sure that processes are simple and user friendly!\n\n16\n\nVALUE INFORMED “HAPPY PATHS”\nWhat’s on the menu is what’s on the mind.\nSee Ad on Social Media\nClick on Photo\nClick Link in Bio\nBrowse Products\nSTANDARD PRODUCT VIEW\nFast delivery option \t\t$$$\nBudget option\t\t     \t    $\nPremium option\t\t             $$$$\nPopular choice\t\t  \t$$$\nVALUE ALIGNED VIEW\nQuality\nSustainability\nTime\nEco friendly option\t\t                $$\n95% recycled materials\n15 mins wait time\nLocal artisan option\t              $$$\nSupports local economy\n2-days delivery\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nFacilitator discuss: \nWhat we show in each path signals what we think customers should value. Alternative presentations can highlight different aspects of the same product.\nCustomers want their needs met and their values are upheld. Showing your customers their values through the user experience design is an element of creating a happy customer path.\nFor customers, what’s on the menu is what’s on the mind. Ensure their values are expressed in a clear way all through the user experience and design.\nDiscuss: What are some benefits and challenges that arise as we develop customer journeys which incorporate customer values alongside their needs and wants?\n\n17\n\nOUR DESIGN JOURNEY\nValue Proposition\nWorkflow Architecture\nProduct Layout\nUI\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nThis is the first step in a series of steps that will lead us to a perfectly designed product for our customers!\nTrainer should go over each step and explain how we will do it:\nValue proposition: This should be at the forethought of the entrepreneurs minds at all times. All of the other components are built upon delivering value to the customers. We did this during Ignite, and touched on it again today. Understanding your customers value proposition, includes the needs and wants as well as their values.\nBusiness processes: How does the user interact with your product day to day? What are the actions they take to get the value delivered to them? Again, we started this today through the happy path, but you should go deeper by defining the alternative journeys as well. \nProduct layout: Once we know what we are trying to deliver and the user flow, we must define how users will interact with your business. What does the user do at each step? How do they interact with your actual product? How do they physically navigate through their whole journey? We will spend a lot of time on this when we begin to prototype and test! \nUI: What does the user see? What designs are visible? Color and font schemes are determined to make the product visually appealing. This is the last step. It doesn’t matter if your product looks nice if the user doesn’t have a good experience achieving their goal. \n18\n\nOUR DESIGN JOURNEY\nValue Proposition\nWorkflow Architecture\nProduct Layout\nUI\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nWe have already started! These steps are critical to creating a strong foundation for the rest of our design. Make sure that you spend the next week working on these two parts. We will look at them next Sunday!\n19\n\nBECAUSE…\nGOOD DESIGN \nGOOD BUSINESS\n=\n3 minutes: Lecture \n\nRemember, Good design = Good business\nWhen you are thinking of your customers as you design your product, you are developing a good business. A good business is one that is sustainable, profitable, and has clear competitive advantage (among other things). \nThis is the design of your actual product/service, but also the design of your business (HOW your customer gets and pays for it).\nNext session we will dive into the BMC where we will look at all the different elements of your business. Every single part of your business needs to be designed thoughtfully to make sure that you are able to deliver that promised value to your customers.\n\n\n \n\n\n20\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nAdd workflows to your “happy path” of your business and do a peer review. \n\nMake sure that your designs are really solving your customers problems!\n\nDue next Sunday!\n\n\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTrainer note: Some businesses might have a multi-sided business model (marketplaces for instance). Ask the entrepreneurs who have more than 1 happy path to do this for each side of their business.\n21\n\nTHANKS\n\nANY QUESTIONS?\n22 ]]]\n\n",
