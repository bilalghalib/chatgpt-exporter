  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is developing a 5-day green architecture training program for young architects and engineers in Mosul, Iraq, focusing on heritage-inspired sustainable design. They requested a comprehensive analysis comparing their existing slide presentations with implementation guides to identify alignment gaps and create a cohesive training experience. The user emphasized shifting from individual tasks to collective knowledge building, incorporating Islamic values and local wisdom, and making the program more interactive where participants teach themselves rather than being lectured to.\n\nClaude provided detailed feedback on how the slides and guides aligned around core themes (knowledge, beauty, trust, proof, leadership) but diverged in approach - slides being more activity-focused while guides emphasized question-driven, story-based learning. The user specifically wanted to avoid references to post-war reconstruction and instead focus on the core promise of helping architects create buildings that are \"MORE beautiful, MORE comfortable, and MORE profitable\" by understanding heritage wisdom through scientific principles.\n\nThe user requested specific slide updates incorporating cultural narratives, opening questions for each day, and quotes from architect interviews they had conducted. They emphasized the importance of the \"prevention vs. cooling\" economic framework, showing how preventing heat gain is 30 times cheaper than removing it through air conditioning. The conversation evolved into creating detailed facilitation guides matching their existing solar training format, complete with printed worksheets for field activities, daily schedules, and specific scripts for facilitators.\n\nKey elements the user wanted integrated included Hassan Fathy quotes about architects as craftspeople, the concept that solving real problems leads to good business, and the idea of setting a new standard where sustainable design becomes the obvious choice rather than a \"green\" alternative. They emphasized making the training practical and immediately applicable, with participants working on real projects throughout the week and contributing to a design competition featuring a 150-square-meter house prototype. The user demonstrated strong preference for structured, detailed implementation guides with specific timing, materials lists, and facilitator scripts to ensure consistent delivery across different trainers.",

Over the next five days we will travel from العلم – Knowledge to القيادة – Leadership.  \n   Each day has a theme that builds on yesterday.  \n   By Friday you will have a design you trust, proof to persuade others, and the confidence to lead change.”\n\nKey Points:\n  1. Five days = one clear arc (start → finish).\n  2. Themes use Arabic AND English to honour local context.\n  3. Today we focus on العلم – Knowledge & Understanding.\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1: Read the five themes aloud (1 min).  \n  Step 2: Ask learners to guess which day sounds most exciting (1 min).  \n  Step 3: Encourage a quick show of hands; note answers (1 min).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Issue: Arrow text too small at the back.  \n    Solution: Zoom in briefly or read each word clearly.\n\nTransition:\n  “Now that we know our journey, let’s ask the first big question…”\n2\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIce Breakers - \u000b“Good → Better → Best” Insulation Relay\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n*photo of cork tile\nFoam Block\nCork Tile\nIsocam Panel\n[09:10–09:20] – Ice-Breaker: Good → Better → Best Insulation Relay (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Energize the group and introduce key insulation materials by touch, setting the stage for Day 1’s focus on thermal comfort.\n\nSetup:\n  • Participants stand in a loose circle.\n  • Hand each team member one sample in this order: Foam, Cork, Isocam.\n  • Ensure clear space for safe passing.\n\nMaterials needed:\n  • 3 small material samples: foam block, cork tile, Isocam panel.\n  • Bell or chime to signal start/stop.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm every sample is clearly labeled.\n  • Test bell volume so everyone hears.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Alright everyone, let’s wake up those senses! We’ve got three insulation samples—foam, cork, and Isocam. These represent ‘Good,’ ‘Better,’ and ‘Best’ insulation for Mosul’s heat. \n   On my bell, start passing the samples hand-to-hand around the circle. \n   When the person at the end has all three, stack them in the order I said and shout ‘Good, Better, Best!’ \n   Then tell us in one sentence **why** Isocam is the best choice for cutting heat.”\n  \nKey Points ::\n  1. **Tactile Learning**: Hands-on feel embeds material density differences.  \n  2. **Rapid Engagement**: Fast pass keeps energy high.  \n  3. **Concept Hook**: Introduces insulation hierarchy that we’ll revisit today.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In Mosul, families have tried simple foam panels (‘Good’), but cork (‘Better’) added thermal mass, while Isocam membranes (‘Best’) gave the biggest ΔT drop of 7 °C in our demo.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  1. **Pass samples** clockwise on the bell.  \n  2. **Stack samples** at the end: foam, cork, Isocam.  \n  3. **Shout** “Good, Better, Best!” and state one benefit of Isocam.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  • Issue: **Samples get dropped or confused.**  \n    Solution: Pause, re-label each sample, and restart quickly.  \n  • Issue: **Circle too tight or bumping.**  \n    Solution: Ask everyone to step back for safe passing.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great energy, everyone! Now that we’ve felt the difference in insulation, let’s shift to our first story: why Mosul homes bake in summer and suffer mould in winter.”\n3\n\nBuild your architecture from what is beneath your feet.\n\n- Hassan Fathy -\n4\n\n*QR code\nPre-Assessment Quiz\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nScan QR here\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n[09:30–09:40] – Pre-Assessment Quiz (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Gauge participants’ baseline knowledge and expectations to tailor the training and measure growth at Day 5.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Participants stay seated with phones or tablets.\n  Materials needed – Slide with QR code; reliable Wi-Fi.\n  Pre-activity checks – Verify QR code links correctly; test one device.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “It’s time for our pre-assessment! Scan the QR code on screen—there are 7 quick multiple-choice questions plus 3 open-ended ones about your thermal pains, design tactics, and learning goals.”\n  “This helps me understand where everyone stands and lets us measure progress on Day 5.”\n  (Pause for scanning)\n  “You have ten minutes. Hit submit when you’re done—answers are anonymous.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Anonymity:** Your responses help me, not you personally.  \n  2. **Honesty:** There are no right or wrong “expectation” answers—be candid.  \n  3. **Time-boxed:** Aim for 1 min on MCQs, 3 min on open-ended.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “Last cohort’s pre-quiz showed many underestimated generator costs—so we focused extra on that math in Day 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Open your phone’s camera or QR app and scan the code.  \n  Step 2: Complete the 10 questions (7 MC, 3 open) within 10 min.  \n  Step 3: Tap “Submit” to record your responses anonymously.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: Slow Wi-Fi.  \n    Solution: Share printed short-links or paper handouts as backup.  \n  Issue: QR won’t scan.  \n    Solution: Manually type the URL displayed beneath the code.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—while the results roll in, let’s move into our daily agenda.”  \n\n7 Multiple-Choice Questions (select one)\nA properly sized courtyard in Mosul can reduce indoor temperature by at least:\nA) 1–2 °C\nB) 3–4 °C\nC) 5–6 °C\nD) 7–8 °C\nAnswer: B) 3–4 °C\u000b\nLarge glass façades in hot climates typically:\nA) Always improve summer comfort\nB) Usually increase solar heat gain\nC) Have no effect if tinted\nD) Eliminate the need for insulation\nAnswer: B) Usually increase solar heat gain\u000b\nAt today’s fuel prices, running a diesel generator in Mosul costs approximately:\nA) < 100 IQD/kWh\nB) 100–150 IQD/kWh\nC) 150–200 IQD/kWh\nD) > 200 IQD/kWh\nAnswer: C) 150–200 IQD/kWh\u000b\nTraditional insulation materials like cork have an R-value roughly in the range of:\nA) 0.3–0.6 m²·K/W\nB) 0.7–1.0 m²·K/W\nC) 1.5–2.0 m²·K/W\nD) 2.5–3.0 m²·K/W\nAnswer: B) 0.7–1.0 m²·K/W\u000b\nPassive stack-ventilation in heritage homes works because:\nA) Cold air sinks and pushes out hot air\nB) Warm air rises and pulls in cooler air\nC) Solar chimneys generate electricity\nD) Glass roofs trap heat for comfort\nAnswer: B) Warm air rises and pulls in cooler air\u000b\nA sustainable BOQ should always include an “overhead” line of approximately:\nA) 2 % of material + labor\nB) 5 % of material + labor\nC) 10 % of material + labor\nD) 15 % of material + labor\nAnswer: C) 10 % of material + labor\u000b\nWhich of these is not a common green-building principle?\nA) Water conservation\nB) Embodied energy reduction\nC) Maximizing glass-to-wall ratio\nD) Indoor air quality control\nAnswer: C) Maximizing glass-to-wall ratio\u000b\n3 Open-Ended Questions\nIn one sentence, describe the biggest thermal “pain” your family experiences at home.\n[Example answer: “Roofs so hot in July that we have to sleep on the balcony.”]\u000b\nName one heritage-inspired tactic you think could help solve that pain.\n[Example answer: “Adding a small courtyard to pull cooler air through.”]\u000b\nWhat is your personal learning goal for this training week?\n[Example answer: “I want to master cost-effective insulation strategies.”]\n5\n\n📍 Location: Old Mosul neighborhood\n\n🌡️ Roof Temp: 49 °C in summer, damp & mould in winter\n\n⛽ Energy Cost: ~200k-300k IQD/month for cooling\n\n💭 Dream: Cool upstairs bedrooms & quieter nights\nMeet Ahmed’s Family\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Large photo or sketch of a typical Mosul courtyard home (sun-baked roof, simple façade)\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n09:25 – 09:30 – Client Profile: Ahmed’s Family (5 min)\u000bPurpose\nQuickly introduce a concrete persona so all later empathy exercises have a real “client” in mind.\nSetup\nProject the “Meet Ahmed’s Family” slide full-screen.\nAsk everyone to take out a pen and a sticky note.\u000b\nMaterials Needed\nProjector & “Ahmed Family” slide\nSticky notes + pens\u000b\nPre-activity Checks\nEnsure the slide image and text are legible.\nVerify participants can see the emoji bullets.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Let’s put a face on our work—meet Ahmed’s family. They live in an old Mosul house with a flat roof that hits 49 °C in July and floods with damp in winter. To keep cool, they run a small diesel generator, spending about 600 000 IQD each month. Their dream? Sleeping upstairs again—quiet, cool, and without that fuel bill stress.”\nKey Points\nHeat & Moisture Extremes: 49 °C summers & mouldy winters\nCost Pain: 600 000 IQD/mo generator bills\nEmotional Goal: Comfort and dignity—sleep indoors again\u000b\nLocal Example\n“Remember Wifaq’s retrofit that dropped 17 °C inside—that’s exactly the kind of relief Ahmed’s family needs.”\nActivity Instructions\nReflect (30 s): Write on a sticky note one new insight about Ahmed’s situation.\nShare (1 min): Invite 2–3 volunteers to read theirs aloud.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: “I don’t know what to write.”\u000b Solution: Prompt: “Think about what keeps them up at night.”\nIssue: Overly general notes (“They’re hot”).\u000b Solution: Ask them to link to a bullet—e.g., “I’d hate paying 600 000 IQD/mo.”\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—now that we’re all thinking like Ahmed, let’s dive into our pre-assessment and see where we all stand before we begin the training.”\n6\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n[09:40–09:45] – Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n\n7\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat.

Building style reflects our values and needs.  \n  2. Heritage designs solved local climate and social needs.  \n  3. Today we seek to recover that lost wisdom.\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1: Ask learners to pair up and name one feature they notice in each image (2 min).  \n  Step 2: Invite 2–3 volunteers to share their observations (1 min).  \n  Step 3: Highlight links between their observations and local climate challenges (2 min).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Issue: Learners focus only on aesthetics.  \n    Solution: Prompt them: “How does that feature help you stay cool or dry?”  \n  • Issue: Discussion drifts to unrelated topics.  \n    Solution: Gently steer back: “Let’s tie it to ‘why rebuild’ before ‘how rebuild.’”\n\nTransition:\n  “Now that we’ve asked ‘why,’ let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker on insulation…”  \n14\n\nWet Walls in Winter - Leads to mould\nMosul’s Double-Pain\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nThe Rush to Rebuild:\nQuick solutions \nCopied designs without understanding\nLost connection to environment\nResult: Homes like ovens\nIntense Heat in Summer\n09:20 - 09:25 – Expand Problems (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  • Show how rebuilding fast created new problems, so learners see why careful design matters.\n\nSetup:\n  • Physical arrangement – participants facing screen; trainer centre.\n  • Materials needed – projector, pointer ready.\n  • Pre-activity checks – ensure images and click-controlled bullets work.\n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “Let’s ground ourselves again in Mosul’s two pains:  \n     • Mid-July rooftops at 49 °C…  \n     • Winter mould eating into walls.”  \n     (Pause 5 s for silent observation.)\n  2. “Turn to your neighbour and share one word: how does that feel?”  \n     (30 s pair share.)\n  3. “Thank you.

Here’s how we break it down: on the left, you see the three big modern drivers of roof heat: Solar Gain, Poor Insulation, and missing Stack-Vent. On the right, we’ve added the First Principles Framework—six core physical factors that underlie every passive cooling tactic.”\nKey Points ::\nSolar Gain – Intense sun (3 000+ hours/year) bakes flat concrete like a frying pan.\nInsulation Gap – Bare tile or concrete conducts heat straight inside.\nStack-Vent Missing – No path for hot air to escape; it pools on the top floor.\nFirst Principles:\nThermal: How heat transfers by conduction and radiation.\nHumidity: Moisture’s role in comfort and evaporation.\nAirflow: Buoyancy drives stack effect.\nEvaporation: Surface cooling via moisture phase change.\nMass: Thermal storage delays temperature swings.\nSolar: Sun angle, shading, and absorption.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Last summer in Mosul, rooftop sensors hit 60 °C at noon, forcing families downstairs—no surprise given these drivers.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Look at the left-hand bullets—shout out any other modern heat drivers you’ve seen. (30 s)\u000b Step 2: On the right, choose one “First Principle” that you think heritage designs exploited most. (30 s)\u000b Step 3: We’ll tally which principle you pick most—and you’ll see it again in our next demo. (30 s)\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Participants mix up “Airflow” with “Evaporation.”\u000b • Solution: Point to the checkbox grid and clarify: airflow is bulk air movement; evaporation is moisture-driven cooling.\u000b Issue: Too much focus on solar only.\u000b • Solution: Re-direct: “Solar is one part—notice how mass can store or release that energy later.”\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—now that we’ve named the drivers and principles, let’s do a hands-on demo of how heritage stack-vent cooling works.”\n17\n\nPassive Cooling - Stack-Vent\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nKey Points:\n\n🔥 Incense “heat source” at bottom\n🌫️ Smoke → warm-air path upward\n🌬️ Fresh air drawn through low openings\n\nInvestigation: Why does this work?\nBuoyancy: Warm air is lighter, so it rises\nPressure difference: Rising air pulls in cooler air\nContinuous flow: No pumps, just density gradients\n*Photo or schematic of a simple shoebox “tower” with incense inside, arrows showing smoke rising and fresh air drawn in at the base\n[10:05–10:15] – Passive Stack-Vent Cooling (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\nOne sentence explaining why\nSetup:\n• Physical arrangement – Demo table front-center with model visible; participants seated around.\nMaterials needed:\n• Shoebox tower with base hole + open top  \n• Incense stick + lighter  \n• Projector + schematic slide  \nPre-activity checks:\n• Model sturdy & positioned under projector  \n• Incense smoke visible in demo lighting  \n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Now let’s see stack-vent cooling in action—no fans or electricity needed. Here’s our shoebox model: incense at the bottom represents sun-warmed air. Watch as the smoke rises up the chimney and pulls fresh air in from below.”  \n*(Light incense, place in base, pause 10–15 s.)*  \n“Notice the continuous flow: as warm air exits, it draws cooler air in through the hole. That’s exactly how heritage courtyards in Mosul stayed comfortable.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. **Stack effect** moves warm air upward naturally.  \n2. **Air exchange** draws in cooler ambient air at the base.  \n3. **Zero energy**—relies solely on buoyancy and pressure difference.  \n\nInvestigation ::\n- **Buoyancy:** Warm air is lighter, so it rises.  \n- **Pressure difference:** Exiting air creates suction at the base.  \n- **Continuous flow:** Sustains ventilation without fans.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In a recent Mosul retrofit, adding a 3 m courtyard shaft yielded a **4 °C drop** indoors—enough to run without generators for much of the afternoon.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Observe the smoke path—note where it rises and where air enters.  \nStep 2: In your mind, map these openings onto a real courtyard or window design.  \nStep 3: Think of one way to scale this effect up for a room or roof vent system.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: **Smoke too faint to follow.**  \n• Solution: Use a fresh incense stick; dim room lights briefly.  \nIssue: **Participants focus only on smoke, not airflow.**  \n• Solution: Ask, “Where does the new air come from?” while pointing to the base hole.\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that we’ve seen how passive ventilation works, let’s turn those cool-air flows into real IQD savings on generator fuel.”  \n18\n\nConverting Heat Relief into IQD\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nExample:\n15 amps × 12,000 IQD/amp\nHow much does everyone here estimate they spend a month on cooling in the summer?\n📊 SPREADSHEET MOMENT \u000b open the Generator Cost Calculator sheet in your workbook\n[10:15–10:30] – Converting Heat Relief into IQD (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show the direct money value of every amp you shave off with passive cooling.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Ask participants to have the “Generator Cost Calculator” sheet open on their laptops.\u000b • Prepare a marker-ready whiteboard beside you.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Ensure the slide’s formula is legible from the back row.\u000b • Confirm you have a clear pointer or laser.\u000b • Verify most participants have the cost calculator sheet open in their workbook.\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Let’s link each amp saved to real IQD savings. If you haven’t already, please open the Generator Cost Calculator sheet in your workbook now.”\n(Pause for 15 s while participants open the sheet.)\n“Every breeze we save with passive cooling translates into less generator run-time—and big IQD savings.”\n“Here’s the basic math: local generators run at about 12 000 IQD per amp per month. If your cooling load draws 15 amps, that’s 12 000 × 15…”\n(Point to “12 000” then “15” on the slide.)\n“…for a total of 180 000 IQD per month.”\n“In practice, families powering multiple rooms often hit 600 000 to over 1 000 000 IQD monthly just on fuel. That’s why reducing even a few amps with passive design immediately pays off.”\n“Quick show of hands: who guessed more than 180 000 IQD? Who guessed less? Great—that variation shows how big the stakes are.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\n12 000 IQD/amp-month is our unit cost.\nMultiplying by amps gives your monthly bill.\nSmall amp savings scale to large IQD reductions.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In one Mosul household, cutting just 3 amps via a small courtyard saved 36 000 IQD monthly—enough for an extra sack of flour.”\nTransition ::\u000b “Now that we’ve seen the cash impact on paper, let’s do a hands-on demo: measure a real ΔT on our incense tower, plug it into the same formula in your cost calculator sheet, and calculate your own savings.”\n19\n\nCreative Heating & Cooling \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nYour ΔT ↔ IQD Savings\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nCreative passive solutions that work on first principles can solve both heating and cooling problems\n[10:30 – 10:45 Hands-On Demo: ΔT Cost Math (15 min)]\nPurpose:\u000b Have participants measure a temperature drop (ΔT) in our shoebox tower and convert it into real IQD savings.\nSetup:\nDemo tables with one incense-tower model per group.\nIR gun for each team.\nWhiteboard with formula template:\nΔT (°C) ×  Amp-savings  × 12 000 IQD = IQD/mo saved\nMarkers and eraser.\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify each incense stick lights reliably.\nConfirm IR guns are set to surface-mode.\nWhiteboard marker is fresh.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Each group, light your incense tower and let it run for 30 seconds. Use the IR gun to capture the top-and-bottom temperature difference—your ΔT in °C.”\n“Now, on your whiteboard, write down your ΔT value.”\n“Next, estimate how many amps of generator load that ΔT equates to—let’s assume 1 °C drop ≈ 1 amp of cooling load saved.”\n“Finally, multiply: ΔT × 12 000 IQD. That’s your monthly IQD savings from this passive effect.”\nActivity Instructions:\nMeasure ΔT\nStart incense, wait 30 s, record Hot and Cool IR readings.\nCompute ΔT = Hot − Cool.\u000b\nEstimate Amp Savings\nUse 1 °C → 1 amp rule of thumb.\u000b\nCalculate IQD Savings\nΔT × 12 000 IQD = Your group’s monthly fuel cost reduction.\u000b\nShare\nOne volunteer from each group calls out their number and sticks it on the board.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Smoke too faint → IR gun misreads.\nSolution: Reposition stick or use a fresh incense.\u000b\nIssue: Amp-rule confusion.\nSolution: Remind: “We’re using 1 °C = 1 amp for this demo.”\u000b\nTransition:\n“Fantastic—those savings are real!

(10 min)\n\nPurpose :\nOffer a quick, visual definition of green building via the “triple bottom line,” then connect to local Iraqi projects.\n\nSetup :\nParticipants seated; slide projected full-screen.\n\nMaterials needed :\n– Projector & clicker\n– Remote for slide advance\n\nPre-activity checks :\n– Ensure slide is visible from back row\n– Confirm icons rendered correctly\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Let’s pause on our comfort story and zoom out: green building is any design that benefits three things—planet, people, and profit. You see here the three pillars:\n🌍 Planet: we choose materials and systems to cut waste and carbon.\n👥 People: healthy air and comfortable spaces matter as much as efficiency.\n💰 Profit: lower bills and stronger resale value keep projects viable.\n\nIn Iraq, we’re already seeing this in action. The Baghdad Green Zone pedestrian lighting uses solar-powered fixtures, and Babylon’s Green University campus is LEED-certified—proof that theoretical benefits translate into real-world impact.\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Green building isn’t just “eco.” It balances environmental, social, and economic gains.\n2. Health and comfort drive user satisfaction—never overlook the people pillar.\n3. Financial returns (energy savings, higher valuation) win over even the toughest budget guard.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In Mosul’s reconstruction, small solar street-lights in public squares reduced generator use by 70 %—that’s planet + people + profit at work.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Turn to your neighbor and name one green-building item you’ve seen locally (1 min).\nStep 2: We’ll ask three pairs to share one quick example. (3 × 30 s)\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: “Too abstract—what counts as ‘green’?”  \nSolution: Point to clear, tangible examples (solar lamps, LEED buildings).\n\nIssue: “Profit doesn’t seem ‘green.’”  \nSolution: Emphasize that long-term savings free budgets for future projects.\n\nTransition ::\n“Great examples! Now let’s bring it back to our own challenges—what personal pain does this green approach help solve?” (Bell → next verbal Q-prompt)\n21\n\n💬 Name 1 Personal Pain This Links To\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n“______________________”\n“______________________”\n“______________________”\n[10:40 - 10:45] – Guided Q-Prompt: “Name 1 personal pain this links to” (5 min)\n\nPurpose :\nBreak the theory block by surfacing real learner pain points and linking them back to green-building benefits.\n\nSetup :\nNo slide animation; projector remains on the prompt slide.

Based on what we just saw about green building’s planet, people, and profit benefits, I want each of you to think of one ‘pain’ that you or someone you know faces in your home or work site—something this approach could solve.”\n\n“When I ring the bell, three volunteers will share one pain each, in one sentence. Ready?”  \n*(Ring bell)*  \n“Who’d like to go first?”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Link abstract benefits to concrete, personal frustrations.  \n2. Encourage brief, one-sentence shares to keep energy high.  \n3. Highlight diversity of pains—thermal discomfort, high bills, mould, etc.\n\nLocal example ::\n“One trainee might say, ‘I hate waking up sweating because my room feels like an oven,’ which ties directly to our cooling-load discussions.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1: Participants think silently for 30 seconds.  \nStep 2: Ring bell – Volunteer 1 shares their pain (max 20 s).  \nStep 3: Ring bell – Volunteer 2 shares (20 s).  \nStep 4: Ring bell – Volunteer 3 shares (20 s).\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Long-winded responses →  \nSolution: Gently interject: “Great point—let’s hear it in one sentence.”  \nIssue: No one volunteers →  \nSolution: Call on a confident participant: “Ali, how about you?”  \n\nTransition :\n“Thanks for those honest shares—they remind us why green-building matters. Now let’s take a “sneak peek” of Rhino + Ladybug teaser.”  \n22\n\nRhino & Ladybug Teaser – Model Toggle\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Full-screen screenshot of the Mosul house massing in Rhino, with the courtyard void highlighted.\n10:45 – 10:50 (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how easily the courtyard intervention can be toggled on/off in Rhino, priming participants for Day 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)’s digital simulation.\nSetup:\nProjector displaying the full‐screen Rhino viewport screenshot.\nTrainer computer with the Mosul massing file loaded.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nRhino + Ladybug plugin installed.\nSample Mosul house 3D file.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nConfirm the “courtyard” layer is present and named correctly.\nEnsure Ladybug toolbar is visible in Rhino.\u000b\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Here’s our 3D massing of a typical Mosul home. Notice on the left the solid roof, and on the right the inset courtyard void highlighted. In Rhino, a single click on the ‘courtyard’ layer toggles that void on and off—no complex commands needed. On Day 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع), you’ll each open this exact file, switch the courtyard in Ladybug, and instantly see how airflow and daylight pathways change.”\nKey Points ::\nOne-click toggle isolates the heritage intervention.\nVisual clarity helps link design moves to performance.\nNo coding required—accessible to all skill levels.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In last month’s pilot, trainees mastered this toggle in under two minutes and were able to run their first simulations by lunch.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nObserve the highlighted “courtyard” layer in the screenshot.\nNote how on Day 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع) you’ll repeat this toggle in your own Rhino session.\nPrepare any questions about file organization.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Layer not visible.\u000b Solution: Unlock layers panel or restart Rhino.\nIssue: Ladybug toolbar missing.\u000b Solution: Re-load plugin via Tools → Options → Plugins.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Next, let’s see the payoff of that toggle—how heat‐map overlays shift when the courtyard is on vs. off.”\n23\n\nRhino & Ladybug Teaser – Model Toggle\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Left Panel (“Courtyard OFF”): Heat-map overlay on the 3D roof model showing high surface temperatures in reds and oranges.\n*Right Panel (“Courtyard ON”): Heat-map overlay with more yellows and blues indicating cooler surfaces.\n10:50 – 10:55 (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Visually demonstrate the thermal impact of adding a courtyard by comparing before/after heat‐map overlays.\nSetup:\nProjector showing the side-by-side panels: “Courtyard OFF” vs. “Courtyard ON.”\nTrainer computer ready to animate between the two screenshots.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nLadybug heat-map results exported as PNG.\nSample 3D file with both overlays saved.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify both images are full-resolution at screen size.\nConfirm the legend and color scale are legible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “On the left is our roof with no courtyard: reds and oranges indicate surface temperatures peaking highest. On the right, the inset courtyard shifts the palette toward yellows and blues—on average about 3 °C cooler across the deck. This comparative view is your proof of concept long before you write a line of code.”\nKey Points ::\nColor shift from red→blue directly maps to temperature drop.\nAverage ΔT ≈ 3 °C shows passive design benefit.\nImmediate visual cue builds confidence in heritage strategies.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “A contractor we worked with used similar overlays to persuade a café owner—she switched from glass walls to a shaded courtyard after seeing a 5 °C drop.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nScan both panels for the coolest and hottest zones.\nNote the approximate ΔT from the color legend.\nJot down one question about the heat-map scale or legend.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Legend text too small.\u000b Solution: Zoom in or adjust projector focus.\nIssue: Colors look washed out.\u000b Solution: Check projector color profile or ambient light.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “With that visual proof in mind, let’s take a break”\n24\n\nInvestigation Method\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[ Observe ] → [ Measure ] → [ WHY ] → [ Principle ] → [ Modern Use ]\n10:55–11:00 – Investigation Method (5 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Anchor a clear, repeatable process for exploring each heritage feature before we break.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the flowchart slide full-screen; participants ready.\u000b Materials needed:\u000b • Slide with five-step flowchart\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b Pre-activity checks:\u000b • Verify flowchart is legible from the back row\u000b • Confirm pointer works properly\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Before our break, let’s anchor how we explore each heritage feature.

Ready? 3–2–1… GO!”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. **Accuracy matters:** Call out the number you measured.  \n2. **Speed counts:** First to shout gets the win.  \n3. **Celebrate data:** Reinforce the value of measuring performance.\n\nLocal example ::\n“In one of our pilot sessions, a team shouted ‘8 °C!’—that matched our courtyard case study and blew everyone away.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer counts down 3–2–1.  \n2. Teams shout their ΔT simultaneously.  \n3. Trainer rings bell for the quickest correct answer.  \n4. Award snack to that team; acknowledge the group’s results.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: Multiple teams shout same number at once.  \n  Solution: Ring bell and ask those teams to raise hands; pick one randomly.  \n• Issue: Incorrect ΔT shouted.  \n  Solution: Ask for a show of hands from teams with the actual reading; confirm before awarding.\n\nTransition ::\n“Great energy—let’s carry that momentum into our morning session but before that, let’s jump to daily agenda !”  \n45\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\n[09:45–09:50] – Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n\n46\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat.

Some are heritage-inspired and ideal for Mosul’s heat; others look great on Instagram but waste energy. At your table, each person grabs one card, reads it aloud, and—based on Day 2’s Ihsân principle—decides if it Works for Mosul or Doesn’t Work. Place it on the corresponding sheet.”\u000b (Demonstrate with one sample card.)\u000b “I’ll signal when you’re halfway through and again at 10 minutes.”\nKey Points:\nContext is king: A feature is only good if it fits Mosul’s climate and culture.\nBeauty + benefit: Thumbs-up for solutions that are both elegant and practical.\nRapid consensus: Aim for quick, data-informed decisions based on what you’ve learned.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “A carved mashrabiya screen gives lovely patterns of light and shade while allowing airflow—perfect for Mosul.”\nActivity Instructions:\nPick a card (5 s).\nDiscuss its merits vs. drawbacks (15 s).\nPlace it on “Works” or “Doesn’t Work” (5 s).\nRotate roles so each team member sorts at least three cards.\nReview remaining cards together if time allows.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nDisagreement on a card? → Prompt: “Which first principle does it address—or violate?”\nCards fall off chart? → Use extra tape or move to a sturdier board.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great sorting! Notice which patterns emerged—those insights will feed directly into our Learn session.”\n49\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\n50\n\nLocal Materials & Islamic Design Principles\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nLocal Materials\nDesign Principles\n• Clay brick: high thermal mass\n• Mashrabiya screens: geometric shade\n• Gypsum plaster: moisture buffering\n• Courtyard orientation: sun & wind control\n• Limestone blocks: cool surface finish\n• Wind-tower alignment: capture breezes\n• Timber lattice: filtered light & air\n• Patterned overhangs: dynamic shading\n10:10–10:25 – Local Materials & Islamic Design Principles (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Demonstrate how indigenous materials and Islamic design patterns work together—beauty that performs.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants seated with notebooks or workbooks open.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Small samples of clay brick, gypsum, and lattice if available\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the slide is fully visible.\u000b • Ensure any physical samples are laid out on the side table.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now we marry material science with Ihsân—doing good beautifully. On the left are four local materials chosen for their thermal or moisture properties:\u000b • Clay brick for high thermal mass\u000b • Gypsum plaster for moisture buffering\u000b • Limestone block for cool surface finish\u000b • Timber lattice for filtered light and air\nOn the right are four Islamic design principles that shape environment and experience:\u000b • Mashrabiya screens for geometric shade\u000b • Courtyard orientation for sun and wind control\u000b • Wind-tower alignment to capture breezes\u000b • Patterned overhangs for dynamic shading\nTogether, these pairings form a holistic toolkit: bricks store heat by day, plaster evens humidity, lattice lets breezes in, and patterns cast shade where you need it most.”\nKey Points ::\nThermal mass & finish: Clay, gypsum, and limestone regulate heat and humidity.\nIhsân patterns: Geometry isn’t decoration—it controls sun angles and airflow.\nSynergy: Materials + patterns amplify both comfort and beauty.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul’s old quarter, thick brick walls stay 4 °C cooler inside, while mashrabiya windows cast moving shade and channel breezes into rooms.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nStep 1 (5 min): In your team, choose one material and one design principle to combine in Ahmed’s home.\nStep 2 (5 min): Sketch a simple icon or pairing diagram in your notebook.\nStep 3 (5 min): Share your pairing and rationale in one sentence with the group.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Participants confuse material functions.\u000b • Solution: Ask, “Which component stores heat versus which buffers moisture?”\nIssue: Focus drifts to aesthetics only.\u000b • Solution: Redirect: “Remember—each pattern must solve a climate or privacy challenge.”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent pairings! Now that we’ve seen the ‘what’ and ‘why,’ let’s move into the ‘how much’ with Thermal Mass vs Insulation next.”\n51\n\nThermal Mass vs Insulation\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nThermal Mass\nInsulation\n• Clay brick, stone, concrete\n• Foam boards, fiberglass, aerogel\n• Function: Stores & slowly releases heat\n• Function: Blocks heat flow\n• Benefit: Dampens temperature swings\n• Benefit: Keeps interiors cooler longer\n• Drawback: Heavy, slow response\n• Drawback: Thinner materials may degrade over time\n10:25–10:40 – Thermal Mass vs Insulation (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Clarify when to use heavy materials versus insulating layers in passive design.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the comparison slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants seated, ready with notebooks or scrap paper.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Sample brick fragment and foam board swatch\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the slide’s table is legible from all seats.\u000b • Ensure any physical samples are on display.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s dive into two core passive strategies: Thermal Mass and Insulation. On the left you see heavy materials—brick, stone, concrete—that store heat by day and release it slowly at night. On the right are lightweight insulators—foam boards, fiberglass, aerogel—that block heat transfer altogether.”\u000b (Point down each column.)\u000b “Thermal mass is ideal in climates with large day–night swings—like Mosul’s desert fringe—while insulation excels when you need a strong barrier against continuous sun.”\nKey Points ::\nThermal Mass: Dampens temperature swings by storing heat.\nInsulation: Resists heat flow, keeping interiors cooler continuously.\nTrade-off: Mass is heavy and slow to respond; insulation performs instantly but can degrade.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, thick brick walls can reduce indoor highs by 4–6 °C after sunset, whereas under-roof insulation keeps afternoon peaks 2–3 °C lower.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPair up with a neighbor and choose one material from each column.\nDiscuss briefly (3 min) which you’d prioritize for Ahmed’s roof and why.\nShare one team’s choice and rationale with the full group (2 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nConfusing storage vs. blocking? → Ask, “Does this material hold heat so it’s released later, or stop it from coming in?”\nWondering about availability? → Prompt: “Which option can Ahmed source locally—brick or foam?”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent—keep those distinctions in mind. Next, we’ll quantify these effects with our Heat-Gain Demo: Glass vs Shade.”\n52\n\nHeat-Gain Demo: Acrylic “Glass” vs. Cardboard “Mashrabiya”\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Photo Zone A (clear acrylic)\n*Photo Zone B (cardboard shade).\nZone\nIR Temp (°C)\nA: Acrylic\n______\nB: Shade\n______\nΔT =\nA – B = __ °C\n* A desk-lamp icon positioned 15 cm above both zones with an arrow indicating the lamp height.\n“Every 1 °C reduction ≈ X Wh cooling saved”\n10:40–10:55 – Heat-Gain Demo: Glass vs. Shade (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Quantify how much extra solar heat a clear glass surface adds compared to traditional shaded treatments.\nSetup:\u000b • Place two sample zones side-by-side on the demo table under a desk lamp.\u000b • Participants remain seated in small groups around the table.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Clear acrylic panel (“glass”)\u000b • Cardboard mashrabiya model (“shade”)\u000b • Adjustable desk lamp\u000b • IR gun\u000b • Tape measure or ruler to set lamp height\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Position the lamp exactly 15 cm above both samples.\u000b • Warm up the IR gun and set to surface-temperature mode.\u000b • Confirm participants can see both zones clearly.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s put our material choices to the test. We have two zones: Zone A is clear acrylic, and Zone B is our cardboard mashrabiya shade. First, I’ll switch on the lamp and let both surfaces heat for 30 seconds—just enough for them to reach a steady state.”\u000b (Turn on lamp; wait 30 s.)\u000b “Okay, let’s record temperatures. Pair up: one of you points the IR gun; the other reads aloud.”\nDemo Steps:\nMeasure Zone A (glass) (1 min):\u000b “Aim at the surface, hold steady, and call out the temperature for Zone A.”\nMeasure Zone B (shade) (1 min):\u000b “Now switch to Zone B and record that reading.”\nCalculate ΔT (1 min):\u000b “On our slide table, write ΔT = Temp_A – Temp_B. That difference shows how much extra heat the glass traps.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\nSolar penalty: Glass traps more heat, raising surface temperature.\nShade benefit: Simple overhangs or lattice can cut ΔT significantly.\nEnergy link: Every 1 °C reduction equates to roughly X Wh of cooling energy saved.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our pilot workshop, glass surfaces heated to nearly 65 °C, while shaded models stayed around 50 °C—ΔT of 15 °C translates into hundreds of watts saved.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nLamp on for consistent heating (30 s).\nRecord Zone A temp (20 s).\nRecord Zone B temp (20 s).\nCompute and announce ΔT (40 s).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nLamp drifts: Tape its base or clamp it in place.\nIR gun misreads reflections: Aim slightly off-axis at a matte spot.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen the numbers, let’s shift to how you’ll source these solutions locally with our Supplier Ecosystem overview.”\n53\n\nSupplier Ecosystem Map\nDay 2 - Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nMaterial\nSupplier Type\nExample Vendor\nLocation\nClay Bricks\nBrickworks\nMosul Clay Co.\nOld City, Mosul\nGypsum Plaster\nGypsum Plant\nNineveh Gypsum Factory\nNinewa Province\nLimestone Blocks\nQuarry\nHillside Stone Quarry\nWestern Ninewa\nTimber Lattice\nCarpentry Workshop\nHeritage Lattice Carpentry\nMosul Workshop Alley\nMashrabiya Screens\nWoodcarving Studio\nAl-Rashid Woodworks\nEast Mosul\nReflective Coatings\nPaint Supplier\nAl-Shams Building Supplies\nCentral Mosul\n10:55–11:05 – Supplier Ecosystem Map (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Show teams where and how to source every material and craft element they’ve just learned about.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the “Supplier Ecosystem Map” slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants seated with their notebooks open.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Printed list of local supplier contacts\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the table is fully visible and legible.\u000b • Ensure any printed contact lists are at the side table.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we know which materials and patterns we need, here’s how you actually get them. On screen is a snapshot of Mosul’s supplier ecosystem: brickworks, gypsum factories, quarries, woodcarvers, and paint vendors. Each row shows a material, the type of supplier, an example vendor, and their location.”\n(Point row by row.)\u000b “For example, Mosul Clay Co. in the Old City produces high-density clay bricks, while Al-Rashid Woodworks specializes in intricate lattice screens. You’ll build relationships with these local experts to ensure authenticity, quality, and faster lead times.”\nKey Points ::\nLocal sourcing reduces cost and supports the community.\nSpecialized craftspeople maintain heritage quality (e.g., mashrabiya carving).\nProximity matters: closer suppliers mean faster delivery and lower transport energy.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our pilot, teams who partnered with the Nineveh Gypsum Factory secured custom plaster mixes in half the usual lead time.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nChoose one material from your design and note its supplier type.\nWrite down the example vendor and their location in your notebook.\nDiscuss with your neighbor which supplier you’d contact first and why (3 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Uncertain which supplier fits a custom order.\u000b → Solution: Encourage calling the workshop; many will handle small bespoke runs.\nIssue: Vendor contact info missing.\u000b → Solution: Use the printed list or ask workshop staff for introductions.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent—now let’s take a 30-minute break.

Hands Up!”\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\n[09:25–09:35] Ice-Breaker: “R or U? Hands Up!” (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Get everyone energized and cement the distinction between R-value (insulation) and U-value (conductance) before our deep dive.\nSetup:\u000b Participants remain in their seats or stand in a semi-circle. No materials required.\nMaterials needed:\u000b None.\nPre-activity checks:\u000b Ensure everyone can see the two icons on screen and understands “right = R, left = U.”\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Alright everyone, let’s play ‘R or U? Hands Up!’ I’ll read a quick statement about a material or scenario. If you think it’s about R-value (resisting heat), raise your right hand. If it’s about U-value (letting heat through), raise your left hand. Simple? Let’s test it!”\nStatements (call 6–8):\n“A thick wool blanket in winter.”\n“A single-pane glass window at midday.”\n“A dense cork under a roof slab.”\n“An uninsulated metal roof in July.”\n“A high-performance foam panel.”\n“A thin aluminum sheet.”\n(After each, pause 3 s to let hands go up, then “Right hands! Yes, wool blankets resist heat—R-value.

Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n75\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat.

U-value is the inverse: it’s the rate of heat transfer per square meter per degree—so lower is better.\nYou’ll see on the slide:\nR = m²·K / W  U = W / m²·K\nAnd a quick reminder: Convert cm → m before using the formula—for example, that 3 cm cork sample is 0.03 m thick.”\u000b (Point to the “0.03 m thickness” icon.)\nKey Points ::\nR = thickness ÷ λ (units m²·K/W)\nU = 1 ÷ R (units W/m²·K)\nAlways convert your thickness into meters first.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul, a 3 cm cork panel (λ ≈ 0.04 W/m·K) gives R ≈ 0.75 m²·K/W—compare that to 1 cm foam (λ ≈ 0.025) which is only R ≈ 0.4.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPass the three samples down each row—feel thickness and spot differences.\nOn the whiteboard, write R = thickness / λ using meters (e.g., 0.03 m / 0.04). Calculate R together.\nInvert that R value to get U, and record it beside your formula.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nConfusing cm vs. m? → Always divide cm by 100 before plugging into R = thickness/λ.\nThinking higher U is better? → Remind: U measures leakiness—lower is more resistant.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—we can now quantify insulation performance. Next, let’s explore typical R-values in common building materials.”\n79\n\nR-Value Table - Common Building Materials\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[09:55–10:00] – R-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Show the spectrum of insulation performance so teams can choose materials strategically.\nSetup : Project a clear table of 8–10 common materials and their R-values. Leave space on whiteboard for jotting examples.\nMaterials needed : Printed handout or projected slide of R-Value table (foam, cork, brick, concrete, wood, PIR, XPS, EPS).\nPre-activity checks : Ensure everyone can read the smallest font; confirm marker works for whiteboard notes.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Now that we know how to calculate R and U, let’s see real values for materials you’ll actually work with. This table shows R-value per material—higher resistivity means better insulation. Take a moment to scan through and think which ones fit Mosul’s climate and budget.”\nKey Points :\nLightweight foams and PIR/XPS panels have R ≈ 3–6 m²·K/W.\nTraditional materials (brick, stone) sit below R 1 m²·K/W.\nWood and cork are mid-range (R ≈ 1–2 m²·K/W) but offer heritage appeal.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “A 10 cm layer of expanded polystyrene (EPS) gives you around R 2.8—similar to a 15 cm thick traditional mashrabiya wall, but at half the thickness.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, pick two materials—one “high R” and one “low R”—and write their R-values on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 2: Debate which you’d specify for a sun-facing wall vs. an interior partition.\u000b Step 3: Volunteer teams share their choices (1 min each) and rationale.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing material thickness vs. R-value.\u000b Solution: Remind: table is already normalized to standard thickness. Focus on relative performance.\nIssue: Assuming “best R” always wins.\u000b Solution: Emphasize trade-offs: cost, heritage look, moisture risk.\nTransition :\u000b “Great discussion—next we’ll flip these R-values into U-values so you can compare whole assemblies.”\n80\n\nU-Value Table\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n[10:00–10:05] – U-Value Table (5 min)\nPurpose : Reinforce the inverse relationship between resistance and conductance so teams grasp why U-value matters in real assemblies.\nSetup : Project the U-Value table slide and leave room on the whiteboard to jot sample calculations. Arrange participants so they can see both screen and board.\nMaterials needed : Projected slide of U-Value table; whiteboard and marker.\nPre-activity checks : Verify slide is legible from back row; confirm whiteboard marker writes clearly.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Here we flip R on its head: U-value tells us how much heat passes through per square meter per degree difference. Lower U means less heat gain. Take a moment to scan: you’ll notice traditional brick sits around U 0.8, while Thermostone is down at U 0.2—four times better.”\nKey Points :\nU = 1/R, so doubling R halves U.\nDense materials like concrete block have high U (≈1.3–1.5).\nSpecialty insulators (Thermostone) can achieve U <0.3 despite light weight.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 30 cm solid brick wall (U ≈0.85) will let roughly three times more heat inside than a 10 cm Thermostone panel (U ≈0.21).”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, choose two materials from the table—one high U and one low U—and calculate the ratio of their heat gains (e.g. 0.85 ÷ 0.21 ≈ 4).\u000b Step 2: Write your ratio and material names on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 3: One pair volunteers to explain why that ratio matters for selecting sun-facing walls.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Confusing U and R units.\u000b Solution: Remind: R in m²·K/W resists heat; U in W/m²·K conducts heat. Higher U = more heat leak.\nIssue: Thinking density improves insulation.\u000b Solution: Emphasize: density affects thermal mass, not directly conduction—focus on U-values for insulation decisions.\nTransition :\u000b “Great insight—next, we’ll see these differences in action under our heat lamp and confirm the numbers with IR readings.”\n81\n\nLow solar gain, low daylight\nGlazing Ratios: Getting It Right\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n*Schematics of Façade A: 20% Glazing (small window area)\n*Schematics of Façade B: 40% Glazing (moderate window area)\n*Schematics of Façade C: 60% Glazing (large window area)\nBalanced daylight & thermal control\nHigh daylight, high cooling load\n10:05–10:15 – Glazing Ratios: Getting It Right (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Help teams choose appropriate window-to-wall ratios to balance daylighting benefits against cooling penalties.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain seated, sketchbooks or notebooks ready.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Handouts of a façade template for quick sketches\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the three façade graphics and percentages are clear from all seats.\u000b • Verify participants have a pen or pencil for sketching if desired.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Next, let’s tackle glazing ratios—the percentage of your wall that’s glass. Too little, and you lose daylight; too much, and you bake your interior. On screen are three examples:\n20% glazing gives minimal solar gain but also poor daylighting.\n40% glazing hits a balanced sweet spot—good light with manageable cooling loads.\n60% glazing floods the room with light but drives up air-conditioning use dramatically.\u000b In Mosul’s summer, we generally aim for 30–45% glazing to optimize both comfort and energy.”\u000b\nKey Points ::\nLow glazing (<25%) = low solar gain but dim interiors.\nModerate glazing (30–45%) = good daylight with tolerable heat gain.\nHigh glazing (>50%) = bright, but high cooling loads and glare.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In our Mosul retrofit, a 40% glazing retrofit with shade fins dropped peak indoor temperatures by 3 °C compared to a previous 60% cut-and-paste glass façade.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nSketch on your notebook one façade with ~35% glazing (2 min).\nDiscuss with your neighbor: what shading detail would you add to that ratio? (3 min)\nVolunteer one idea to the group. (2 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nMisestimating percentages? → Use the façade template handout and lightly pencil shading to count grid squares.\nFocusing only on daylight? → Remind: “Every 1% glazing above 45% can add up to X W/m² of solar gain.”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that we know how to size our openings, let’s turn to our next slide: Building Trust Through Accuracy, where we’ll set clear cooling-load targets.”\n82\n\nPresent real numbers—accurate data earns client trust.\nBuilding Trust Through Accuracy\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nIntervention\nCooling Load (W/m²)\nTarget\nUnshaded concrete wall\n~300\n🚫 too high\nInsulated wall (10 cm EPS)\n~200\n✓ acceptable\nCourtyard-shaded wall or overhang\n~100\n★ ideal\n10:15–10:25 – Building Trust Through Accuracy (Cooling-Load Targets)\nPurpose:\u000b Show how setting clear cooling-load targets (in W/m²) and sharing them honestly with clients builds credibility and trust.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain at their seats with notebooks.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Pointer or laser\u000b • (Optional) Printed “target sheet” for quick reference\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the table and icons are legible.\u000b • Ensure participants have a pen and can sketch if they wish.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we understand how to size our glazing and materials, let’s talk accuracy. Clients value real data. On screen are three representative cooling-load figures for Mosul:\nAn unshaded concrete wall runs around 300 W/m², which is prohibitive.\nAdding 10 cm of EPS insulation brings it down to 200 W/m², an acceptable level.\nA courtyard-shaded wall or well-designed overhang achieves 100 W/m², our ideal target.\u000b\nWhen you present these numbers clearly, you earn your client’s trust—because you’re honest about performance and realistic about outcomes.”\nKey Points ::\nQuantified targets: Share W/m² goals for each intervention.\nBenchmarking: Show “too high,” “acceptable,” and “ideal” zones.\nAccuracy = Trust: Clients respect data-driven transparency.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In a recent Mosul retrofit, we showed homeowners the simulated cooling loads: they switched from an initial 280 W/m² design to a courtyard solution hitting 95 W/m²—and signed the contract on the spot.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nPair up and pick one intervention from the table.\nSketch (in words) how you’d explain its W/m² target to a client in under 15 seconds. (3 min)\nVolunteer one pair to deliver their client-brief tagline. (2 min)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nClients balk at numbers? → Frame in relatable terms: “That 100 W/m² is like running one 100 W bulb per square metre—can your generator keep up?”\nConfusion over units? → Remind: “W/m² is energy per area under full sun—bigger walls need more shading or insulation.”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Excellent—now that we’ve anchored our accuracy theme, let’s head to the field with our Construction Site Observation Guide to see these targets in action on real building sites.”\n83\n\n🧱 Materials ▢\n(e.g. brick type, insulation panels, shading elements)\n\n🛠️ Methods ▢\n(e.g. masonry joint quality, installation sequencing)\n\n👷 Workers ▢\n(e.g. skill level, safety practices, team organization)\n\n📋 Organization ▢\n(e.g. site layout, material staging, waste management)\nConstruction Site Observation Guide\nDay 3 - Truth & Trust (الصدق والثقة)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n10:25–10:35 – Construction Site Observation Guide (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\u000b Equip teams with a simple, repeatable checklist for observing real-world construction quality and processes on-site.\nSetup:\u000b • Project the “Construction Site Observation Guide” slide full-screen.\u000b • Participants remain seated with notebooks or tablets ready to note findings.\nMaterials needed:\u000b • Projector + slide\u000b • Notebook or tablet for each participant\u000b • (Optional) Printed one-page guide if preferred\nPre-activity checks:\u000b • Confirm the four checklist items and icons are fully visible.\u000b • Ensure participants have pens or devices to record notes.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Before we head into our Design Studio, let me introduce our Construction Site Observation Guide.

Do they follow best practices?\nOrganization: Look at site logistics—are materials staged logically? Is waste managed?”\u000b\n(Point to each checkbox as you speak.)\nKey Points ::\nHolistic view: Good buildings start with good materials and methods.\nPeople matter: Skilled, organized crews deliver better outcomes.\nSite order: Efficient site organization reduces errors and waste.\u000b\nActivity Instructions ::\nReview each checklist category silently (1 min).\nDiscuss with your neighbor one thing you’ve seen in past projects under any category (3 min).\nWe’ll apply this guide tomorrow—be ready to fill in your own observations.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nOverwhelmed by detail? → Focus on one category at a time, rotating your attention every 30 seconds.\nMissing context? → Ask site supervisors “Why do you stage materials here?” to understand organization choices.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—keep that guide in mind.

Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s we go to daily agenda.”  \n104\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\n[09:25–09:30] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context.

We’ll wrap up with certificates and launch our 30-day online design competition. Let’s dive in by grabbing your IR-guns and heading out!”\nKey Points:\nField Mini-Visit gives real context for this sprint.\nDesign Sprint builds on all you’ve learned—rapid, hands-on.\nLightning Pitches reinforce your ability to sell and measure growth.\u000b\nLocal example:\u000b “Just like Laith did last month—he measured a neighbor’s courtyard and turned that insight into a winning café proposal.”\nActivity Instructions:\nNote your team number and grab a clipboard with the Field Cue Card.\nHead out in your pairs for the 20-minute site snap.\nWe’ll reconvene at 09:25 in this room—don’t be late!\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\u000b Issue: Teams lagging behind schedule.\u000b Solution: I’ll ring the bell at 09:20 to remind everyone to return.\u000b Issue: Missing cue cards.\u000b Solution: Grab a backup from the front table before you go.\nTransition:\u000b “Alright—clipboards in hand, IR-guns ready, let’s step outside for our Field Mini-Visit!”\n\nHow do we make excellence standard?\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n09:00 – 09:10 | Opening: “How do we make excellence standard?”\nPurpose :\u000b Kick off Day 5 by framing the central question of this module—how to embed excellence as a routine practice.\nSetup :\u000b • Participants seated in small groups of 4–5 around tables.\u000b • Slide with only the question projected full-screen.\nMaterials needed :\u000b • Projector & clicker\u000b • Flip-chart and markers at each table\nPre-activity checks :\u000b • Confirm slide question is legible from all seats.\u000b • Ensure each table has a flip-chart sheet and working markers.\n\nFacilitator Script :\n“Good morning and welcome to Day 5, where we shift from proof to standards.”\n“Our guiding question today is: ‘How do we make excellence standard?’”\n“Take two minutes in your groups to discuss what excellence means in our context—and how we can ensure it becomes everyone’s baseline, not a bonus.”\n“After two minutes, we’ll capture your top ideas on the flip-chart and share with the room.”\n“Feel free to think broadly—individual habits, team processes, industry norms, or policy levers that can lock in high quality.”\nKey Points :\nDefinition: Clarity on what “excellence” looks like.\nEmbedding: Moves from one-off wins to repeatable practices.\nScaling: Ideas for spreading standards across teams and projects.\u000b\nLocal example :\u000b “In Mosul, one firm standardized thermal testing on every project—so clients now expect and receive consistent ΔT verification.”\nActivity Instructions :\nStep 1 (2 min): Discuss as a group: list three ways to make excellence non-negotiable.\nStep 2 (3 min): Synthesize your ideas and write the top two on the flip-chart.\nStep 3 (3 min): One representative per group shares their flip-chart with the room.\nStep 4 (2 min): Trainer notes emerging themes on a central board.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Groups struggle to define “excellence.”\u000b Solution: Prompt: “Think of one moment when you were truly impressed—what made it stand out?”\nIssue: Discussion drifts to unrelated topics.\u000b Solution: Refocus: “How can that same trait become your everyday standard?”\u000b\nTransition :\u000b “Thank you for those rich ideas. Now, let’s quickly recap yesterday’s key proof-and-persuasion takeaways before we dive into Presentation Craft.”\n126\n\nQuick Recap \nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nHow does an accurate Comparative BOQ build client trust?\nWhich proof style converts which type of client mind?\n09:10 – 09:20 | Quick Recap (10 min)\nPurpose :\u000b Refresh yesterday’s core Day 4 learnings—BOQ accuracy and proof-style matching—so we start Day 5 with everyone aligned.\nSetup :\u000b • Participants remain at their tables in their small groups.\u000b • Slide “Quick Recap” projected full-screen.\nMaterials needed :\u000b • Projector & clicker\u000b • Whiteboard or flip-chart for noting key takeaways\nPre-activity checks :\u000b • Verify slide text is visible from all seats.\u000b • Ensure there’s space on the board to capture responses.\nFacilitator Script :\n“Let’s warm up with a quick recall of Day 4.”\n“First question: How does an accurate Comparative BOQ build client trust?”\nPause for 1–2 volunteers to answer.\n“Excellent. Second question: Which proof style—Visual, Numbers, Stories, or Experience—converts which type of client mind?”\nPrompt groups to shout out matches, then clarify.\n“Great—those two pillars (accuracy and proof-style matching) are the foundation for today’s work.”\u000b\nKey Points :\nComparative BOQ accuracy—clients trust clear, error-free numbers.\nFour proof types—match proof to client mindset to persuade effectively.\nLocal example :\u000b “In Mosul, one contractor’s error-free BOQ cut follow-up questions by 60 %, and showing a sample demo (✋ Experience) won over hands-on skeptical clients.”\nActivity Instructions :\nStep 1 (3 min): Groups discuss and prepare one concise answer to each question.\nStep 2 (4 min): One representative per group shares their answers; trainer writes top phrases on the board.\nStep 3 (3 min): Trainer synthesizes responses into two summary sentences.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\nIssue: Participants struggle to recall exact terms.\u000b Solution: Prompt: “Think back to our Good/Better/Best table and the eye, number, book, hand icons.”\nIssue: Discussion drifts into new topics.\u000b Solution: Refocus: “We’re only recapping two Day 4 essentials—let’s stay on those.”\u000b\nTransition :\u000b “Fantastic recap! Now let’s address any lingering ‘Yesterday’s Questions’ before we dive into Presentation Craft.”\n127\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nYesterday’s Questions \nQ1: …\nQ2: …\nQ3: …\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[09:50 – 10:00] Yesterday’s Questions Answered (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\nClarify top reflections and ensure everyone starts Day 5 with common understanding.\n\nSetup:\n• Participants seated, facing the Q-Wall summary slide.\n• Trainer stands near the screen with a mic or pointer.\n\nMaterials needed:\n• Slide “Yesterday’s Top 3 Questions & Answers.”\n• Mic or clicker to advance bullets.\n\nPre-activity checks:\n• Confirm slide loads correctly.\n• Ensure audio level (if using mic) is set.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n“Before we move on, let’s dive into the top three questions you posted on our Reflection Wall yesterday. We’ll read each, give a concise answer, and then pause for one quick follow-up if needed.”\n\nKey Points ::\n1. Reinforce key rules (flash-round timing).  \n2. Emphasize safety (ladder 4 : 1 rule).  \n3. Bust big-glass myth with cooling-load logic.  \n\nLocal example ::\n“Remember our generator cost math? Just like we measured ΔT drops in demos, too much glass ramps up ΔT and drives your generator run-time through the roof.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n1. Trainer reads Q1 and A1 aloud.  \n2. Pause 15 s for one follow-up from the group.  \n3. Repeat for Q2 and Q3.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n• Issue: No follow-up questions.  \n  Solution: Prompt with “Does that clarify our flash-round timing?”  \n• Issue: Off-topic remarks.  \n  Solution: Gently steer back: “Great point, but let’s keep our focus on safety rules.”\n\nTransition ::\n“Excellent—now that our questions are answered, let’s warm up with a quick ice-breaker:!”  \n128\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[09:20 – 09:25] Daily Agenda: 3-Block Rhythm (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Quickly orient participants to the day’s flow—Learn, Apply, Sell—so they know what to expect and why it matters.\n\nSetup:\n  Physical arrangement – Keep participants seated facing the screen with the agenda slide up.\n  Materials needed – Projector or large display; clicker to highlight each block.\n  Pre-activity checks – Ensure the slide is visible and icons render correctly on all screens.\n\nFacilitator Script ::\n  “Before we dive into our first Learn block, here’s the heartbeat of our training: the 3-Block Rhythm.”\n  “First, **LEARN**—about 45 to 60 minutes of focused theory, real data, and demos. Feel free to interrupt me with questions; that’s exactly what this block is for.”\n  “Next, **APPLY**—60 to 90 minutes in small teams at hands-on stations. This is where you practice, troubleshoot, and learn by doing. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—that’s the fastest path to mastery.”\n  “Finally, **SELL**—30 to 45 minutes to pitch back what you’ve learned in a customer context. This mini-task wraps up each day with energy and helps you translate skills into value.”\n  “Every day, we’ll follow Learn→Apply→Sell. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle and use it in our design competition finale. Let’s kick off with our first Learn block!”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. **Structure:** Consistent rhythm anchors each day and balances theory, practice, and application.\n  2. **Engagement:** Questions in Learn; experimentation in Apply; celebration in Sell.\n  3. **Progress:** Daily Sell blocks build confidence and reinforce learning.\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In our Mosul pilot last year, teams who embraced the 3-Block Rhythm improved their project proposals by 40 %—they practiced more and pitched with confidence.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Read through each block as I highlight it.\n  Step 2: Nod or raise one finger if you have a quick question about any block.\n  Step 3: We’ll refer back to this slide after each block to track our progress.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\n  Issue: **Participants lose sight of the agenda**  \n    Solution: I’ll briefly recap the rhythm after each block transition.\n  Issue: **Time-keeping slips**  \n    Solution: I’ll use the visible timer and give 5-minute warnings.\n\nTransition ::\n  “Great—now that we all know the plan, let’s jump into our highlight of each day”  \n129\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\nDay\nTheme\nSummary Highlights\n1\nUnderstanding Energy\nLearn how modern homes overheat.

Open your model, toggle the courtyard void layer on, and draw a 50 m² wall extrusion on the sun-facing façade—your ‘sun-wall.’ Be precise: it should measure 10 m wide by 5 m tall (or equivalent configuration), for a total area of 50 m². Once you’ve got it, take a clean screenshot and name the file TeamYourNumber_Mass.png. Ready? Your 15 minutes starts now.”\nKey Points\nAccuracy: 50 m² exact—model grid snapping helps.\nVisibility: Ensure the courtyard void remains visible for context.\nNaming: Use the exact filename convention for easy collection.\u000b\nLocal example\u000b “In last month’s hackathon, one team mis-sized their wall by 10 % and saw a proportional error in their ROI—so double-check your dimensions now.”\nActivity Instructions\nOpen the Mosul massing file and toggle “courtyard ON.”\nDraw or extrude your sun-wall to total 50 m².\nOrbit the camera for a clear orthographic view.\nScreenshot and save as Team#_Mass.png.\nUpload to the shared folder when done.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nMis-scaled wall: Remind: “Use grid snap or input exact dimensions.”\nLayer hidden: Prompt: “Check your Layers panel—courtyard ON.”\u000b\nTransition\u000b “When your screenshot is saved, get ready for Sprint Task 2: running that mass through Ladybug to extract your annual kWh savings.”\n141\n\nTask 2: Ladybug Simulation\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🏷️ Toggle your “sun-wall” layer + load Mosul_HOURLY.epw\n▶️ Run Annual Cooling simulation\n📊 Locate baseline vs retrofit kWh/year\n📸 Screenshot summary panel as Team#_kWh.png\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[11:40 – 12:05] – Sprint Task 2: Ladybug Simulation (15 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Quantify annual cooling energy savings for your sun-wall mass so teams can translate design moves into kWh metrics.\nSetup:\nTeams at Rhino/Grasshopper workstations with their mass model loaded.\nTrainer computer projecting one live run for reference.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nRhino + Grasshopper with Ladybug plugin installed\nMosul_HOURLY.epw weather file available in each project folder\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify each team’s model has the “sun-wall” extrusion baked and visible.\nConfirm the Ladybug “Run Annual Analysis” component is connected.\nEnsure the weather file path is correct in each Grasshopper definition.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Now that we have our 3D mass, let’s see its real-world performance. In Grasshopper, toggle on your ‘sun-wall’ geometry, load the Mosul_HOURLY.epw weather file into the Ladybug Annual Energy component, and hit ‘Run.’ It’ll take about 1–2 minutes to generate your cooling-load report. When it finishes, find the summary panel that shows kWh/year for both baseline and retrofit scenarios. Take a clear screenshot named TeamYourNumber_kWh.png and upload it.”\nKey Points:\nConsistent Setup: Everyone must use the same weather file for fair comparison.\nLayer Accuracy: Only the “sun-wall” difference should drive the kWh delta.\nClear Export: Ensure axes and legend are visible in your screenshot.\u000b\nActivity Instructions:\nToggle your “sun-wall” layer ON in Rhino.\nLoad Mosul_HOURLY.epw into the Ladybug component (2 min).\nRun the annual simulation (5 min).\nCompare baseline vs retrofit kWh (4 min).\nScreenshot and save as instructed (4 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nSimulation fails: Check that all geometry is baked/internalized in Grasshopper.\nWeather file missing: Download from the shared drive and reload.\nUI clutter: Collapse unused panels so the summary graph is clear.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great—now that you’ve captured your annual kWh savings, let’s move on to Sprint Task 3: filling out your ROI sheet to convert those kWh into IQD/year savings.”\n142\n\nTask 3: ROI Sheet\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n📊 Inputs: Baseline & Retrofit kWh/year\n⚡ Tariff: 500 IQD/kWh\n➗ ΔkWh: Baseline − Retrofit\n✖️ IQD/yr: ΔkWh × 500 IQD\n📝 Enter values in ROI template\n📸 Screenshot your filled sheet as Team#_ROI.png\nDay 5 - Leadership & Change (القيادة والتغيير)\n[12:05 – 12:15] – Sprint Task 3: ROI Sheet 10 min\nPurpose:\u000b Translate your annual energy savings into clear monetary value (IQD/year) so every design choice speaks directly to the client’s wallet.\nSetup:\nTeams at their laptops with the “Courtyard-ROI.xlsx” or “Sprint-ROI.xlsx” open.\nTrainer computer projecting a completed example ROI sheet.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nROI Excel template pre-loaded.\nCalculator (optional) for manual checks.\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nEnsure the tariff cell is set to 500 IQD/kWh (or current local rate).\nConfirm each team’s kWh screenshot is saved and accessible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “You’ve just captured baseline and retrofit kWh/year from Ladybug. Now let’s convert that delta into IQD: subtract retrofit from baseline to get ΔkWh, then multiply by the tariff—500 IQD per kWh. Enter those numbers into your ROI template. When your sheet auto-calculates your annual savings, take a clean screenshot named TeamYourNumber_ROI.png and upload it.”\nKey Points:\nΔkWh accuracy: Subtract retrofit kWh from baseline precisely.\nTariff consistency: Always use the same rate for fair comparison.\nAuto-calculation: Trust the spreadsheet formula but spot-check one row manually.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul, cutting just 1 000 kWh saves 500 000 IQD per year—enough to cover a month’s groceries.”\nActivity Instructions:\nOpen your ROI template (1 min).\nPaste your baseline & retrofit kWh values (2 min).\nConfirm ΔkWh and multiply by 500 IQD (3 min).\nScreenshot the filled ROI summary (4 min).\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nFormula broken: Re-enter the tariff cell or copy the working formula from the example.\nScreenshot shows gridlines: Collapse grid view or zoom in on the summary box.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Excellent—now you have your annual savings in IQD.

With just two small grants, she and her team restored two of the four historic qunatra, reviving stone arches and community pride against all odds.”\n  “Next is Wifaq—a civil engineer who applied a simple, heritage-inspired cork render to his family’s home. He measured a **17 °C drop** indoors—enough that his children moved off the blistering rooftop and back upstairs, and that generator fuel bills fell sharply.”\n  “Finally, Laith always says, ‘Trust is our currency in Mosul.’ By delivering one exceptional heritage retrofit, he earns ten new referrals—proving that empathy and technical rigor travel hand-in-hand.”\n  “By the end of this week, you’ll have the tools to slash heat, boost comfort, and build trust—just like Fatima, Wifaq, and Laith.”\n\nKey Points ::\n  1. Local Leadership: Small, community-driven projects can transform public space (Fatima).  \n  2. Tangible Results: Simple materials deliver measurable comfort gains (Wifaq).  \n  3. Emotional ROI: Empathy-driven quality work multiplies referrals (Laith).\n\nLocal example ::\n  “In 2024, another Mosul engineer applied that same cork render in a school—students reported falling asleep more comfortably during lessons.”\n\nActivity Instructions ::\n  Step 1: Listen to each story (2 min).  \n  Step 2: Reflect silently: Which story resonates most with you?

Confirm or adjust the tariff cell to today’s IQD/kWh.  \n  3. Review the “Annual Savings” output and note it for your proposal.  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Formula error: If savings don’t appear, check that ΔkWh and tariff cells are formatted as numbers.  \n  • Tariff mismatch: If the figure seems too low/high, re-verify the tariff with the handout.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Excellent—now capture that Savings cell and your BOQ table as high-res visuals. In Task 5, you’ll embed them into your proposal deck along with your model screenshot.”  \n170\n\nDay 4 - Proof & Persuasion (البرهان والإقناع)\nIntro & File-Naming\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\n🖼️ Gallery Placeholder\n Insert photo: Team#_Ladybug_kWh.png\n Insert screenshot: Team#_SunWallModel.png\n Insert BOQ & ROI visuals: Team#_BOQ.png, Team#_ROI.png\n📁 Filename Conventions\nUse Team<Number>_<ContentType>.<ext>\n\nExamples:\nTeam2_Ladybug_kWh.png\nTeam2_CourtyardROI.png\nTeam2_ProposalDeck.png\n💡 Tip: Export all images ≥ 300 dpi for crisp print and screen sharing.\n[12:30–12:40] – Task 5: Capture High-Res Photos & BIM Screenshot (10 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Prepare professional-quality visuals for your proposal deck, ensuring clarity and impact.\n\nSetup:\n  • Teams open their proposal deck template on laptops.  \n  • Slide projected shows placeholders and naming conventions.  \n\nMaterials needed:\n  • Your saved image files (Ladybug graphs, model views, BOQ/ROI snapshots).  \n  • Deck template with image frames ready.  \n\nPre-activity checks:\n  • Confirm each team’s images are exported at ≥ 300 dpi.  \n  • Verify deck template frames are unlocked and sized correctly.  \n\nFacilitator Script:\n  1. “Now you’ll drag your high-res images into the gallery placeholders in your proposal deck.”  \n  2. “Follow the filename convention `Team#_<Content>.<ext>` so we can track and share easily.”  \n  3. “Make sure each image fills its frame without distortion—right-click → ‘Fit to Frame’ if needed.”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Consistency: Uniform naming helps us collate all teams’ assets later.  \n  2. Quality: 300 dpi ensures sharp visuals both on screen and in print.  \n  3. Placement: Use the deck’s built-in frames to maintain layout alignment.  \n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Locate your “kWh Savings” graph and drag into first placeholder (2 min).  \n  2. Insert your Sun-Wall model screenshot into second frame (2 min).  \n  3. Add your BOQ and ROI snapshots into the gallery (4 min).  \n  4. Save your deck as `Team#_FinalDeck.pptx` and upload to Telegram (2 min).  \n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Image too large/low res: Re-export from source at 300 dpi.  \n  • Frame locked: Right-click frame → Format → Unlock or ask me to unlock.  \n\nTransition:\n  “Great—your deck is now visually ready. Next, we’ll learn how to pitch this phased-upgrade plan using our rubric.”  \n171\n\nDay 1-5 Overview\nDay 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\nDay\nLearn\nApply\nSell\n1\nPost‑war vs heritage: ask why new roofs over‑heat\nFive‑step Investigation Method links observe → measure → principle\nSafe IR‑gun & ladder rules for data you can trust \n3‑station rotation: IR scans, empathy map, visual‑nutrition wall  \nLog temps in workbook and connect to PAIN/GAIN\nDraft empathy map bullets with colour‑coded markers \nFill Pain→Price matrix linking pains to cost lines\nScript a 60‑s Hook = Problem + Proof + Ask\nFilm and share “Explain‑Like‑I’m‑5” pitch video \n2\n“How can beauty serve humanity?” quick reflections\nSort 20 cards: Works for Mosul vs Doesn’t Work\nSee local Supplier Ecosystem Map for key materials \n3 mini‑stations: smoke‑fan stack‑vent demo, courtyard ROI sheet, supplier speed‑dating\nEnter baseline 300 → retrofit 100 W/m² to get ≈ 2.5 yr pay‑back\nLog price & lead time from three real suppliers \nMake It Viral: 30‑s clip with Hook, Proof, Ask\n60‑s Pitch Battles + peer Q&A scored on clarity & trust  \nDebrief top 3 arguments tied to ROI on flip‑chart \n3\nExport wall areas & U‑values from BIM to CSV for BOQ\n“Honesty builds partnerships” — Trust Test overview\nWhy supplier calls ground every rate in reality \nMap CSV data into BOQ spreadsheet with live formulas \nCall two suppliers and record price + lead time in database\nRole‑play Trust Test: present BOQ to a sceptical client \nShow full BOQ table (qty, rate, markup, source)\nDefend each line under live objections to prove transparency\nCapture feedback to refine cost‑vs‑value story \n4\nFour proof styles: 👁 Visual, 🔢 Numbers, 📖 Stories, ✋ Experience\nBuild Good / Better / Best cost table for quick compare\nRate × Qty accuracy drill to cement trust \nComplete Comparative BOQ and spot formula errors\nTag each BOQ line with best proof; role‑play Convert‑the‑Skeptic\nDraft 3 social posts (visual, data, story) and track reactions \nObjection‑Response: answer with one focused proof style\nBundle visuals + numbers + stories into client proof pack\nShare #ProofThatWorks results on reflection wall \n5\nMicro‑class: 3‑Slide Punch (Logic, Emotion, Trust)\nRun annual sun‑wall energy simulation in Ladybug\nFrame project as system‑level change on roadmap slide \nScreenshot kWh baseline vs retrofit and save image  \nConvert ΔkWh → IQD savings in ROI sheet\nFinalise design, cost pack & one‑pager for Capstone \n2‑min Leading Change pitch battle with peer scoring\nRecord scores for clarity, trust, cost realism\nShow how savings trigger wider system change in your Ask \n[09:45–09:50] – Day 1–5 Overview (5 min)\n\nPurpose\u000b Give everyone a fast “big picture” of what we will learn, apply, and sell each day this week.\nSetup\nPhysical arrangement: Participants stay seated, facing the projector.\nMaterials needed: Laptop + pointer / clicker; overview slide already on screen.\nPre-activity checks: Slide is readable from the back; pointer works; timer visible.\u000b\nFacilitator Script\n“Friends, before we jump into the details, let’s look at our week on one slide.\u000b You’ll see three columns—Learn, Apply, Sell—and five rows for Days 1-5.\u000b This table shows how each day moves from new knowledge, to hands-on practice, to skills you can pitch or sell.”\nKey Points\nDaily rhythm: We always start by learning the concept, then applying it, then selling the value.\nProgression: Skills build from simple (Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding) to advanced (Day 5).\nOutcome focus: Every day ends with something you can explain to a client or boss.\u000b\nActivity Instructions\nPoint across one row as an example (e.g., Day 1 – العلم / Knowledge & Understanding).\nHighlight how the three blocks link (“We learn about heat flow, test it with an IR gun, then frame it as savings for homeowners”).\nInvite participants to glance ahead and spot a block they’re excited about (10-second quick show of hands).\nCommon Issues & Solutions\nIssue: Slide feels text-heavy.\u000b Solution: Use the pointer to focus on one cell at a time, speak slowly.\u000b\nIssue: Participants read instead of listen.\u000b Solution: Briefly dim screen after explanation to refocus on you.\u000b\nTransition\n“Great—you now see the journey from Day 1 to day 5.

      "content": "Let me carefully analyze the architecture training materials and compare them to identify alignments and divergences, then create a process to align them better.\n\nFirst, let me review what I have:\n1. The PowerPoint slides (Document 2 - text version, Document 3 - PDF version)\n2. The implementation guides (Documents 5-9)\n3. Interview feedback (Document 1)\n\nLet me start by comparing the slides with the implementation guides:\n\n## Day 1 Analysis:\n\n**Slides show:**\n- Title: العلم / Knowledge & Understanding\n- Ice breaker: Good → Better → Best Insulation Relay\n- Pre-assessment quiz\n- Meet Ahmed's Family profile\n- First Principles Framework (Thermal, Humidity, Airflow, Evaporation, Mass, Solar)\n- Stack-vent cooling demo\n- Heat to IQD conversion\n- 3-station rotation (Thermal Proof, Empathy Map, Visual-Nutrition)\n- Pain→Price matrix\n- 60-second hook formula\n- Homework: Pick ONE principle, find 3 Mosul examples\n\n**Implementation guide suggests:**\n- Core question: \"Why do we build the way we do?\"\n- Opening about post-war reconstruction\n- First Principles investigation with \"WHY\" focus\n- \"Explain Like I'm Five\" challenge\n- Collaborative knowledge building\n- Customer Understanding Championship\n- Same homework concept\n\n**Alignment:** Both emphasize first principles, practical measurement, client understanding\n**Divergence:** Slides are more activity-focused, guide is more narrative/question-focused\n\n## Day 2 Analysis:\n\n**Slides show:**\n- Title: Beauty & Benefit / الجمال والمنفعة\n- Quick recap questions\n- ΔT Showdown ice breaker\n- Local materials & Islamic design principles\n- Thermal mass vs insulation\n- Heat-gain demo\n- Supplier ecosystem map\n- 3 stations: Courtyard design, Cardboard model, ROI sheet\n\n\n- Make It Viral challenge\n- Pitch battles\n- Homework: Find 3 beautiful AND functional buildings\n\nI notice the day's content blends creative challenges with practical design principles. The materials explore beauty's intersection with functionality, using viral content and pitch strategies to engage participants. Both slides and guide emphasize local cultural context, pushing participants to think critically about architectural design's deeper purpose and social impact.\n\nThe approach combines technical knowledge with creative expression, challenging participants to see architecture as both a scientific and artistic endeavor. Social media and design challenges serve as innovative learning tools to make complex concepts more accessible and engaging. Technical insights reveal a structured learning journey focused on trust, communication, and persuasion across multiple domains.\n\nDay 3 explores transparency through construction and measurement precision. Key themes include building credibility via accurate documentation, site observations, and supplier partnerships. The approach integrates technical skills like unit conversions with relationship-building strategies.\n\nDay 4 delves into audience engagement, highlighting communication adaptability. The curriculum examines persuasion techniques across different cognitive styles - visual learners, data-driven individuals, narrative consumers, and experience-oriented participants. Strategies include comparative bill of quantities creation, design refinement, and negotiation skills.\n\nDay 5 transitions to leadership dynamics, emphasizing how to institutionalize excellence. The session concentrates on crafting compelling narratives that blend logical reasoning, emotional resonance, and trust-building. Techniques for network activation and movement creation are explored, suggesting a holistic approach to organizational transformation.\n\nExpert interviews validate the methodology, underscoring the importance of interactive, culturally sensitive learning. Participants stress practical application, emotional engagement, and competitive elements as critical success factors.\n\nThe emerging framework integrates technical precision with human-centered design, creating a comprehensive approach to professional development and systemic change.## Analysis: Slides vs Implementation Guide Alignment\n\n### Where They Align Well:\n\n1. **Core Themes & Daily Structure**\n   - Both follow the 5-day journey: Knowledge → Beauty → Trust → Proof → Leadership\n   - Arabic/English titles match perfectly\n   - 3-block rhythm (Learn/Apply/Sell) is consistent\n\n2. **Key Activities**\n   - First principles investigation (Day 1)\n   - Supplier ecosystem engagement (Day 2-3)  \n   - Multiple proof formats (Day 4)\n   - System change focus (Day 5)\n\n3. **Practical Tools**\n   - Both emphasize take-home resources\n   - Real calculations (IQD savings, temperature drops)\n   - Client-focused deliverables\n\n### Where They Diverge:\n\n1. **Framing & Narrative**\n   - **Slides**: Activity-first, technical focus\n   - **Guide**: Question-first, story-driven approach\n   - **Gap**: Slides miss the powerful \"why\" questions and cultural narratives\n\n2. **Cultural Integration**\n   - **Slides**: Limited Islamic references\n   - **Guide**: Rich integration of Islamic values and local wisdom\n   - **Gap**: Slides don't leverage the motivational power of cultural alignment\n\n3. **Engagement Methods**\n   - **Slides**: More individual tasks\n   - **Guide**: More collaborative knowledge building\n   - **Gap**: Slides miss opportunities for peer learning\n\n4. **Competitive Elements**\n   - **Slides**: Basic challenges\n   - **Guide**: Structured competitions with clear scoring\n   - **Gap**: Slides lack the gamification that experts say works\n\n## Process to Align Slides with Implementation Guide\n\n### Step 1: Add Opening Questions\nEach day should start with the core question prominently displayed:\n- Day 1: Add slide \"Why do we build the way we do?\" with comparison images\n- Day 2: Add slide \"How can beauty serve humanity?\" with the hadith\n- Day 3: Already has it - good!\n- Day 4: Emphasize \"Which proof converts which minds?\"\n- Day 5: Already has it - good!\n\n### Step 2: Enhance Cultural Integration\n- Day 1: Add slide about wisdom lost in reconstruction\n- Day 2: Add إن الله جميل يحب الجمال prominently\n- Day 3: Add prophetic saying about truthful merchants\n- Day 5: Add Quranic verse about change\n\n### Step 3: Restructure Activities for Collaboration\n- Day 1: Change individual thermal scans to team investigations with shared documentation\n- Day 2: Emphasize the collaborative sorting and discussion\n- Day 4: Add peer testing component to proof creation\n- Day 5: Structure the open discussion with clear rounds\n\n### Step 4: Add Competition Elements\n- Day 1: Clearly frame \"Customer Understanding Championship\" with scoring\n- Day 2: Structure \"Make It Viral\" as a competition\n- Day 3: Add \"Trust Building Tournament\" to supplier calls\n- Day 4: Frame as \"Proof Power Contest\"\n- Day 5: \"Change Maker Challenge\" with clear criteria\n\n### Step 5: Strengthen the Narrative Arc\nAdd transition slides showing:\n- How each day builds on the previous\n- The journey from individual learning to system change\n- Connection to the climate crisis and Mosul's future\n\n## Expert Critique of Aligned Program\n\nBased on the interview feedback, here's how the aligned program addresses expert concerns:\n\n### Strengths that Match Expert Advice:\n\n1. **Visual & Interactive** (Husam, Thabit)\n   - IR gun demos, sorting activities, live modeling\n   - Hands-on creation of materials\n   - Visual proof generation\n\n2. **Practical Application** (Anfal, Doraid)\n   - Real supplier calls\n   - Actual BOQ creation\n   - Tools they take home and use\n\n3. **Emotional Engagement** (Jaafar)\n   - Ahmed's family story\n   - Cultural/religious connections\n   - Competition elements\n\n4. **Group Dynamics** (Aya)\n   - Collaborative knowledge building\n   - Peer learning and testing\n   - Team challenges\n\n### Areas Still Needing Attention:\n\n1. **More Visual Demonstrations**\n   - Experts emphasize showing over telling\n   - Add more live demos (beyond stack vent)\n   - Create visual comparison boards\n\n2. **Deeper Problem-Solving**\n   - Doraid's approach: present problem → brainstorm → guide to solution\n   - Build this into each day's structure\n   - Let participants discover answers\n\n3. **Flexibility for Different Speeds**\n   - Rana notes people understand at different rates\n   - Build in catch-up mechanisms\n   - Peer support systems\n\n4. **Real Project Integration**\n   - Dalya emphasizes working on actual projects\n   - Could assign a real mini-project from Day 1\n   - Build toward it throughout the week\n\n## Recommended Adjustments Based on Expert Feedback:\n\n### 1. Start Each Day with a Problem\nInstead of announcing topics, present a real problem:\n- Day 1: \"This family spends 300,000 IQD/month on cooling. Why?\"\n- Day 2: \"This building won awards but families hate living in it. Why?\"\n- Day 3: \"This contractor's quote seems honest but something's wrong. What?\"\n\n### 2. Add More Visual Stations\n- Create permanent display boards showing comparisons\n- Use more before/after photos\n- Build physical models participants can manipulate\n\n### 3. Implement Buddy System\n- Pair stronger with struggling participants\n- Rotate pairs daily\n- Build in peer teaching moments\n\n### 4. Create Mini-Project Thread\n- Day 1: Choose a real space to improve\n- Days 2-4: Apply each day's learning to that space\n- Day 5: Present complete solution\n\n### 5. Add \"Aha!\" Moment Captures\n- End each session with \"What surprised you?\"\n- Document and share these discoveries\n- Build on them the next day\n\n## Final Integrated Assessment:\n\nThe aligned program successfully addresses most expert concerns:\n- ✅ Interactive and hands-on\n- ✅ Culturally relevant\n- ✅ Practically applicable\n- ✅ Emotionally engaging\n- ✅ Group-oriented\n\nWith the recommended adjustments, it would fully embody the best practices identified by experienced trainers while maintaining its innovative structure and comprehensive scope.",

Start Each Day with a Problem\nInstead of announcing topics, present a real problem:\n- Day 1: \"This family spends 300,000 IQD/month on cooling. Why?\"\n- Day 2: \"This building won awards but families hate living in it. Why?\"\n- Day 3: \"This contractor's quote seems honest but something's wrong. What?\"\n\n### 2. Add More Visual Stations\n- Create permanent display boards showing comparisons\n- Use more before/after photos\n- Build physical models participants can manipulate\n\n### 3. Implement Buddy System\n- Pair stronger with struggling participants\n- Rotate pairs daily\n- Build in peer teaching moments\n\n### 4. Create Mini-Project Thread\n- Day 1: Choose a real space to improve\n- Days 2-4: Apply each day's learning to that space\n- Day 5: Present complete solution\n\n### 5. Add \"Aha!\" Moment Captures\n- End each session with \"What surprised you?\"\n- Document and share these discoveries\n- Build on them the next day\n\n## Final Integrated Assessment:\n\nThe aligned program successfully addresses most expert concerns:\n- ✅ Interactive and hands-on\n- ✅ Culturally relevant\n- ✅ Practically applicable\n- ✅ Emotionally engaging\n- ✅ Group-oriented\n\nWith the recommended adjustments, it would fully embody the best practices identified by experienced trainers while maintaining its innovative structure and comprehensive scope.",

They want specific guidance on updating/creating slides to align with these principles\n3. They want to ensure Islamic values and local wisdom are richly integrated\n4. They want to shift from individual tasks to collective knowledge building\n5. They want structured competitions\n6. They need clarity on the core promise/call to architects\n7. They want a cohesive, well-structured experience over 5 days\n8. They're interested in making it more interactive - \"them teaching themselves\"\n9. They want to connect to heritage design\n10. They want to operationalize through workbooks\n11. They're thinking about ROI beyond just financial (health benefits, etc.)\n12. They want real projects, not just theoretical ones\n13. They want me to create an updated 5-day plan with all these elements\n\nLet me think about the core promise first. Based on everything we've discussed:\n- It's about reconnecting with heritage wisdom\n- It's about proving that sustainable/traditional approaches are actually cheaper when you count all costs\n- It's about giving them tools to convince clients\n- It's about creating a movement/new standard\n- It's about them becoming leaders of change\n\nThe core promise might be something like: \"In 5 days, you'll discover why heritage buildings work, prove their value in modern terms, and lead Mosul's sustainable building revolution\"\n\nOr more specifically: \"Learn to design buildings that are beautiful, comfortable, AND profitable by understanding the science behind heritage wisdom\"\n\nLet me structure a comprehensive response.## Understanding the Story-Driven Approach\n\n### The \"Why Questions\" Framework\n\nInstead of starting with \"Here's how to insulate a roof,\" we start with:\n- **\"Why does your grandmother's house stay cool without AC?\"**\n- **\"Why do new buildings make families sick?\"**\n- **\"Why do we copy designs that don't work here?\"**\n\nThese questions create curiosity and make participants investigators, not just receivers of information.\n\n### Cultural Narratives That Connect\n\nEach day should weave in stories:\n- **Day 1**: \"After the war, we rebuilt quickly but forgot our wisdom...\"\n- **Day 2**: \"The Prophet ﷺ said Allah is beautiful and loves beauty...\"\n- **Day 3**: \"Trust built the silk road through Mosul...\"\n- **Day 4**: \"Different minds need different proof, like the companions...\"\n- **Day 5**: \"Be the change you wish to see...\" (connecting to Quranic principle)\n\n## Core Promise & Call to Action\n\n### Our Core Promise:\n**\"In 5 days, transform from copying failed designs to creating buildings that are MORE beautiful, MORE comfortable, and MORE profitable than glass boxes - using the science hidden in your heritage\"**\n\n### The Big Call:\n**\"Become the architect who gives families comfort, beauty, and dignity while building a sustainable Mosul\"**\n\n### Key Messages to Repeat:\n1. \"Heritage wisdom + modern tools = superior buildings\"\n2. \"True ROI includes health, comfort, and community\"\n3. \"You already know this - we're just making it systematic\"\n4. \"Together, we set the new standard\"\n\n## Specific Slide Updates\n\n### Day 1 Updates:\n\n**NEW Slide 2: The Question That Changes Everything**\n```\n[Split screen image]\nLeft: Modern concrete box, AC units, suffering family\nRight: 100-year old house, comfortable grandparents\n\n\"Why does the old house work better?\"\n\"What did we forget in our rush to rebuild?\"\n```\n\n**NEW Slide 3: Your Heritage Holds the Answers**\n```\nQuote: \"Build your architecture from what is beneath your feet\" -

They want to shift from individual tasks to collective knowledge building\n5. They want structured competitions\n6. They need clarity on the core promise/call to architects\n7.

They want me to create an updated 5-day plan with all these elements\n\nLet me think about the core promise first. Based on everything we've discussed:\n- It's about reconnecting with heritage wisdom\n- It's about proving that sustainable/traditional approaches are actually cheaper when you count all costs\n- It's about giving them tools to convince clients\n- It's about creating a movement/new standard\n- It's about them becoming leaders of change\n\nThe core promise might be something like: \"In 5 days, you'll discover why heritage buildings work, prove their value in modern terms, and lead Mosul's sustainable building revolution\"\n\nOr more specifically: \"Learn to design buildings that are beautiful, comfortable, AND profitable by understanding the science behind heritage wisdom\"\n\nLet me structure a comprehensive response.",

Include the idea that architects already know sustainability is important, but we need to go deeper\n5. Frame it as \"learning from the past to build the future\" based on first principles\n6. Include quotes from the architect interviews (I should look for these in the testimonials)\n7. Focus on the architect's job being to solve real problems sustainably\n8.

Create a comprehensive plan for implementation\n\nLet me look for relevant quotes from the interviews in the documents...\n\nFrom the interviews I can see:\n- Focus on relationships and trust building\n- The importance of word-of-mouth referrals\n- How good work leads to being invited to family events\n- The business benefits of doing quality work\n\nI need to create a cohesive narrative that:\n- Explicitly states we're setting a new standard\n- Focuses on first principles from heritage\n- Connects to business success\n- Uses actual quotes from the architects\n- Makes it practical and actionable## Core Narrative Reframe\n\n### The Big Call:\n**\"Together, we set the new standard for Mosul - buildings that are beautiful, comfortable, and profitable because they follow timeless principles\"**\n\n### Key Messages:\n1. \"You already know sustainability matters - now learn WHY heritage solutions work better\"\n2. \"Preventing 1°C is 30x cheaper than cooling 1°C\"\n3. \"Great architecture solves real problems = great business\"\n4. \"When we all build this way, it becomes the obvious choice\"\n\n## Updated Opening Framework\n\n### Day 1 Opening:\n```\n\"You're young architects. You know sustainability matters.\nYou've felt the heat on the second floor in summer.\nYou've seen the mold in winter.\n\nMore AC isn't the answer. More solar isn't enough.\n\nThe solution? Understanding WHY buildings work.\nYour grandparents' homes stay cool without electricity - WHY?\nThat's not backwards - that's brilliant engineering.\n\nToday we discover the first principles that make comfort possible.\"\n```\n\n### Core Promise Integration:\n```\n\"Your job as an architect is to solve real problems for real people.\n\nThe Prophet ﷺ said: 'Whoever relieves a believer's distress in this world, \nAllah will relieve his distress on the Day of Resurrection.'\n\nThis isn't just good ethics - it's good business.\n\nAs one successful Mosul architect told us:\n'You know you've done good work when they invite you to their \nchildren's wedding years later. That's when referrals really flow.'\"\n```\n\n## Specific Slide Updates (Based on Original Slides)\n\n### Day 1 Updates:\n\n**Slide 2 - Replace \"Ice Breaker\" with:**\n```\nTitle: \"Your Job: Solve Real Problems\"\n\nQuote: \"The architect who truly serves families never lacks work\" \n- From our interviews\n\nVisual: Split screen\n- Left: Family struggling with heat/cost\n- Right: Family comfortable and grateful\n\nQuestion: \"Which architect gets referrals?\"\n```\n\n**Slide 3 - Add after current content:**\n```\n\"Build from what is beneath your feet\" - Hassan Fathy\n\nThe master architect is a craftsperson who:\n- Understands local materials\n- Respects local climate  \n- Serves local people\n- Creates lasting value\n```\n\n**NEW Slide 8.5 - The Cost Truth:**\n```\nTitle: \"Prevention vs. Treatment\"\n\nPREVENTING 1°C rise:\n- One-time cost: 50,000 IQD/m²\n- Operating cost: 0 IQD/month\n- Comfort: 24/7\n\nCOOLING 1°C:\n- Equipment: 200,000 IQD\n- Monthly cost: 30,000 IQD forever\n- Comfort: Only when running\n\nWhich makes more sense?\n```\n\n### Day 2 Updates:\n\n**Slide 34 - After title, add:**\n```\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الْجَمَالَ\n\"Allah is beautiful and loves beauty\"\n\nBut beauty that causes suffering?\nThat's not beauty - that's deception.\n\nTrue beauty serves humanity.\n```\n\n**Update Slide 37 - Replace content with:**\n```\nTitle: \"Setting the New Standard Together\"\n\nWhen everyone builds:\n✓ With comfort principles\n✓ With local materials\n✓ With proven ROI\n\nIt becomes THE way to build.\nNot \"green\" or \"sustainable\" - just correct.\n\nYour role: Make this standard.\n```\n\n### Day 3 Updates:\n\n**After Slide 68, add quote box:**\n```\nFrom our interviews:\n\"Trust is everything. When you're transparent about costs,\nclients become partners. They recommend you to everyone.\"\n- Successful Mosul contractor\n\n\"My best projects came from referrals. Why? Because I \nexplained every detail, every cost. No surprises.\"\n- Award-winning architect\n```\n\n### Day 4 Updates:\n\n**Slide 102 - Reframe as story:**\n```\nTitle: \"Everyone Needs Different Proof\"\n\nStory: \"I have four relatives:\n- Uncle Ahmed the engineer - needs calculations\n- Aunt Fatima the teacher - needs to see it\n- Cousin Sara the entrepreneur - needs the story\n- Grandfather - needs to touch it\n\nSame benefit, four different proofs.\nWho are you trying to convince?\"\n```\n\n### Day 5 Updates:\n\n**Add after Slide 126:**\n```\nTitle: \"The Movement We're Building\"\n\nIndividual excellence → Everyone doing it → New normal → Policy follows\n\nNot because it's \"green\"\nBecause it's OBVIOUSLY better:\n- More beautiful\n- More comfortable  \n- More profitable\n- More lasting\n\n\"Be the standard you want to see\"\n```\n\n## Implementation Files Needed:\n\n### 1. Master Slide Deck Updates\n- Original slides with new additions marked\n- Transition slides between days\n- Visual consistency guide\n\n### 2. Daily Facilitation Scripts\n```\nDay 1 Example:\n\"Good morning architects. Let's start with truth:\nYou know sustainability matters.

You know sustainability matters.\nYou've felt the heat on the second floor in summer.\nYou've seen the mold in winter.\n\nMore AC isn't the answer. More solar isn't enough.\n\nThe solution? Understanding WHY buildings work.\nYour grandparents' homes stay cool without electricity - WHY?\nThat's not backwards - that's brilliant engineering.\n\nToday we discover the first principles that make comfort possible.\"\n```\n\n### Core Promise Integration:\n```\n\"Your job as an architect is to solve real problems for real people.\n\nThe Prophet ﷺ said: 'Whoever relieves a believer's distress in this world, \nAllah will relieve his distress on the Day of Resurrection.'\n\nThis isn't just good ethics - it's good business.\n\nAs one successful Mosul architect told us:\n'You know you've done good work when they invite you to their \nchildren's wedding years later. That's when referrals really flow.'\"\n```\n\n## Specific Slide Updates (Based on Original Slides)\n\n### Day 1 Updates:\n\n**Slide 2 - Replace \"Ice Breaker\" with:**\n```\nTitle: \"Your Job: Solve Real Problems\"\n\nQuote: \"The architect who truly serves families never lacks work\" \n- From our interviews\n\nVisual: Split screen\n- Left: Family struggling with heat/cost\n- Right: Family comfortable and grateful\n\nQuestion: \"Which architect gets referrals?\"\n```\n\n**Slide 3 - Add after current content:**\n```\n\"Build from what is beneath your feet\" - Hassan Fathy\n\nThe master architect is a craftsperson who:\n- Understands local materials\n- Respects local climate  \n- Serves local people\n- Creates lasting value\n```\n\n**NEW Slide 8.5 - The Cost Truth:**\n```\nTitle: \"Prevention vs. Treatment\"\n\nPREVENTING 1°C rise:\n- One-time cost: 50,000 IQD/m²\n- Operating cost: 0 IQD/month\n- Comfort: 24/7\n\nCOOLING 1°C:\n- Equipment: 200,000 IQD\n- Monthly cost: 30,000 IQD forever\n- Comfort: Only when running\n\nWhich makes more sense?\n```\n\n### Day 2 Updates:\n\n**Slide 34 - After title, add:**\n```\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الْجَمَالَ\n\"Allah is beautiful and loves beauty\"\n\nBut beauty that causes suffering?\nThat's not beauty - that's deception.\n\nTrue beauty serves humanity.\n```\n\n**Update Slide 37 - Replace content with:**\n```\nTitle: \"Setting the New Standard Together\"\n\nWhen everyone builds:\n✓ With comfort principles\n✓ With local materials\n✓ With proven ROI\n\nIt becomes THE way to build.\nNot \"green\" or \"sustainable\" - just correct.\n\nYour role: Make this standard.\n```\n\n### Day 3 Updates:\n\n**After Slide 68, add quote box:**\n```\nFrom our interviews:\n\"Trust is everything. When you're transparent about costs,\nclients become partners. They recommend you to everyone.\"\n- Successful Mosul contractor\n\n\"My best projects came from referrals. Why? Because I \nexplained every detail, every cost. No surprises.\"\n- Award-winning architect\n```\n\n### Day 4 Updates:\n\n**Slide 102 - Reframe as story:**\n```\nTitle: \"Everyone Needs Different Proof\"\n\nStory: \"I have four relatives:\n- Uncle Ahmed the engineer - needs calculations\n- Aunt Fatima the teacher - needs to see it\n- Cousin Sara the entrepreneur - needs the story\n- Grandfather - needs to touch it\n\nSame benefit, four different proofs.\nWho are you trying to convince?\"\n```\n\n### Day 5 Updates:\n\n**Add after Slide 126:**\n```\nTitle: \"The Movement We're Building\"\n\nIndividual excellence → Everyone doing it → New normal → Policy follows\n\nNot because it's \"green\"\nBecause it's OBVIOUSLY better:\n- More beautiful\n- More comfortable  \n- More profitable\n- More lasting\n\n\"Be the standard you want to see\"\n```\n\n## Implementation Files Needed:\n\n### 1. Master Slide Deck Updates\n- Original slides with new additions marked\n- Transition slides between days\n- Visual consistency guide\n\n### 2. Daily Facilitation Scripts\n```\nDay 1 Example:\n\"Good morning architects. Let's start with truth:\nYou know sustainability matters.

Let me start with a question that affects \nevery family in Mosul:\n\nWhy can you sleep on your grandmother's roof in summer, but not \non your own modern roof?\n\nWhy does her 100-year-old house stay comfortable without electricity, \nwhile your new house needs generators running constantly?\n\nThis week, we discover these answers. Not because old is better than new, \nbut because our ancestors understood principles we've forgotten in our \nrush to look 'modern.'\n\nToday, you become detectives - investigating WHY buildings work.\"\n```\n\n**Interactive Element**:\n\"Turn to someone near you. Share one memory of a comfortable old building. \nWhat made it special? You have 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Debrief Key Points**:\n- Thick walls mentioned? \"That's thermal mass\"\n- Courtyards? \"That's stack ventilation\"  \n- Small windows? \"That's solar control\"\n\n**Transition**: \"Let's understand your real job as architects...\"\n\n### 09:15-09:30: Your Job: Solve Real Problems\n\n**Purpose**: Reframe architecture as service, connect to values\n\n**Setup**:\n- **Physical arrangement**: Seated at tables\n- **Materials needed**: Slide with quote, flip chart\n- **Pre-activity checks**: Test projector, prepare markers\n\n**Script**:\n```\n\"What is your job as an architect? Let me share what successful \nMosul architects told us:\n\n'You know you've done good work when they invite you to their \nchildren's wedding years later. That's when referrals really flow.'\n\nYour job is to solve real problems for real people.\n\nThe Prophet ﷺ said: 'Whoever relieves a believer's distress in \nthis world, Allah will relieve his distress on the Day of Resurrection.'\n\nThis isn't just good ethics - it's good business.\"\n```\n\n**Activity - Problem Mapping** (10 minutes):\n1. Each table lists 5 comfort problems families face\n2. Categorize: Heat, Humidity, Ventilation, Light, Noise\n3. Share one unique problem per table\n4. Facilitator maps on board to First Principles\n\n**Key Teaching Moment**:\n```\n\"Every problem you listed has a solution in heritage architecture. \nOur ancestors weren't primitive - they were brilliant engineers \nworking without electricity.\"\n```\n\n**Transition**: \"Let's understand the science they used...\"\n\n### 09:30-10:00: First Principles Framework\n\n**Purpose**: Introduce scientific framework for understanding comfort\n\n**Setup**:\n- **Physical arrangement**: Demo area clear, materials ready\n- **Materials needed**: 6 demonstration setups (see below)\n- **Pre-activity checks**: All demos tested\n\n**Script Introduction**:\n```\n\"Comfort comes from six principles. Our ancestors mastered all six. \nLet me show you...\"\n```\n\n**Live Demonstrations** (5 minutes each):\n\n**1. THERMAL - Heat Movement**\n- Hold ice cube and hot tea cup\n- \"Heat always moves from hot to cold\"\n- \"Three ways: conduction, convection, radiation\"\n- Touch brick vs foam: \"Which conducts faster?\"\n\n**2. HUMIDITY - Moisture Balance**\n- Spray water on two people\n- One in front of fan, one still\n- \"Who feels cooler? Why?\"\n- \"Humidity + air movement = comfort\"\n\n**3. AIRFLOW - Pressure Creates Movement**\n- Light incense stick\n- Show smoke rising: \"Hot air is lighter\"\n- Create cross-breeze: \"Pressure difference pulls air\"\n- \"No electricity needed\"\n\n**4. EVAPORATION - Nature's Cooling**\n- Wet cloth on volunteer's forehead\n- \"Liquid to vapor takes energy\"\n- \"This energy comes from your skin\"\n- \"Traditional fountains use this principle\"\n\n**5. MASS - Thermal Battery**\n- Pass around brick and foam block\n- \"Which stays cool longer?\"\n- \"Mass absorbs heat slowly, releases slowly\"\n- \"That's why thick walls work\"\n\n**6. SOLAR - Sun Angle Intelligence**\n- Use flashlight and cardboard\n- Show summer (high) vs winter (low) angles\n- \"Deep overhangs block summer, allow winter\"\n- \"Free heating and cooling\"\n\n**Quick Check**: Each table assigns one principle to investigate later\n\n**Transition**: \"Now let's talk money - prevention vs. cooling costs...\"\n\n### 10:00-10:30: Prevention vs. Cooling Economics\n\n**Purpose**: Prove financial superiority of passive design\n\n**Setup**:\n- **Physical arrangement**: All facing screen\n- **Materials needed**: Excel with calculations, flip chart\n- **Pre-activity checks**: Calculations verified, marker ready\n\n**Script**:\n```\n\"Here's the truth that changes everything:\nPreventing heat is 30 times cheaper than removing heat.\"\n```\n\n**Live Calculation Together**:\n\n**PREVENTING 1°C Temperature Rise**:\n```\nOne-time costs:\n- Add 5cm insulation: 50,000 IQD/m²\n- For 50m² roof: 2.5 million IQD\n- Lasts 25+ years\n- Zero operating cost\n\nDaily savings: 1°C = 1 amp = 12,000 IQD/month\nPayback: 2.5M ÷ 12,000 = 3.5 months\n```\n\n**COOLING 1°C with AC**:\n```\nOngoing costs:\n- AC unit: 500,000 IQD\n- Monthly power: 30,000 IQD forever\n- Maintenance: 50,000 IQD/year\n- Replacement every 7 years\n\nTotal 25 years: 11.5 million IQD\n```\n\n**Visual on Flip Chart**:\nDraw two columns showing 3.5 month payback vs. never-ending expense\n\n**Interactive Moment**:\n\"If preventing 1°C pays back in 3.5 months, what about preventing 5°C?\"\nLet them calculate: 5 × 12,000 = 60,000 IQD/month saved\n\n**Local Context**:\n```\n\"This is why your grandmother's house works. She prevented heat \ninstead of fighting it. We call this 'passive design' - the building \ndoes the work, not machines.\"\n```\n\n**Transition**: \"Break time! After, you'll investigate these principles in action...\"\n\n[Continue with remaining activities following same detailed format...]\n\n### 10:45-12:15: Heritage Investigation Stations\n\n**Purpose**: Hands-on discovery of principles in real heritage features\n\n**Setup**:\n- **Physical arrangement**: 5 stations around room/building\n- **Materials needed**: IR guns, worksheets, measurement tools\n- **Pre-activity checks**: All stations labeled and equipped\n\n**Overall Briefing**:\n```\n\"You're now heritage detectives.

Let me start with a question that affects \nevery family in Mosul:\n\nWhy can you sleep on your grandmother's roof in summer, but not \non your own modern roof?\n\nWhy does her 100-year-old house stay comfortable without electricity, \nwhile your new house needs generators running constantly?\n\nThis week, we discover these answers. Not because old is better than new, \nbut because our ancestors understood principles we've forgotten in our \nrush to look 'modern.'\n\nToday, you become detectives - investigating WHY buildings work.\"\n```\n\n**Interactive Element**:\n\"Turn to someone near you. Share one memory of a comfortable old building. \nWhat made it special? You have 2 minutes.\"\n\n**Debrief Key Points**:\n- Thick walls mentioned? \"That's thermal mass\"\n- Courtyards? \"That's stack ventilation\"  \n- Small windows? \"That's solar control\"\n\n**Transition**: \"Let's understand your real job as architects...\"\n\n### 09:15-09:30: Your Job: Solve Real Problems\n\n**Purpose**: Reframe architecture as service, connect to values\n\n**Setup**:\n- **Physical arrangement**: Seated at tables\n- **Materials needed**: Slide with quote, flip chart\n- **Pre-activity checks**: Test projector, prepare markers\n\n**Script**:\n```\n\"What is your job as an architect? Let me share what successful \nMosul architects told us:\n\n'You know you've done good work when they invite you to their \nchildren's wedding years later. That's when referrals really flow.'\n\nYour job is to solve real problems for real people.\n\nThe Prophet ﷺ said: 'Whoever relieves a believer's distress in \nthis world, Allah will relieve his distress on the Day of Resurrection.'\n\nThis isn't just good ethics - it's good business.\"\n```\n\n**Activity - Problem Mapping** (10 minutes):\n1. Each table lists 5 comfort problems families face\n2. Categorize: Heat, Humidity, Ventilation, Light, Noise\n3. Share one unique problem per table\n4. Facilitator maps on board to First Principles\n\n**Key Teaching Moment**:\n```\n\"Every problem you listed has a solution in heritage architecture. \nOur ancestors weren't primitive - they were brilliant engineers \nworking without electricity.\"\n```\n\n**Transition**: \"Let's understand the science they used...\"\n\n### 09:30-10:00: First Principles Framework\n\n**Purpose**: Introduce scientific framework for understanding comfort\n\n**Setup**:\n- **Physical arrangement**: Demo area clear, materials ready\n- **Materials needed**: 6 demonstration setups (see below)\n- **Pre-activity checks**: All demos tested\n\n**Script Introduction**:\n```\n\"Comfort comes from six principles. Our ancestors mastered all six. \nLet me show you...\"\n```\n\n**Live Demonstrations** (5 minutes each):\n\n**1. THERMAL - Heat Movement**\n- Hold ice cube and hot tea cup\n- \"Heat always moves from hot to cold\"\n- \"Three ways: conduction, convection, radiation\"\n- Touch brick vs foam: \"Which conducts faster?\"\n\n**2. HUMIDITY - Moisture Balance**\n- Spray water on two people\n- One in front of fan, one still\n- \"Who feels cooler? Why?\"\n- \"Humidity + air movement = comfort\"\n\n**3. AIRFLOW - Pressure Creates Movement**\n- Light incense stick\n- Show smoke rising: \"Hot air is lighter\"\n- Create cross-breeze: \"Pressure difference pulls air\"\n- \"No electricity needed\"\n\n**4. EVAPORATION - Nature's Cooling**\n- Wet cloth on volunteer's forehead\n- \"Liquid to vapor takes energy\"\n- \"This energy comes from your skin\"\n- \"Traditional fountains use this principle\"\n\n**5. MASS - Thermal Battery**\n- Pass around brick and foam block\n- \"Which stays cool longer?\"\n- \"Mass absorbs heat slowly, releases slowly\"\n- \"That's why thick walls work\"\n\n**6. SOLAR - Sun Angle Intelligence**\n- Use flashlight and cardboard\n- Show summer (high) vs winter (low) angles\n- \"Deep overhangs block summer, allow winter\"\n- \"Free heating and cooling\"\n\n**Quick Check**: Each table assigns one principle to investigate later\n\n**Transition**: \"Now let's talk money - prevention vs. cooling costs...\"\n\n### 10:00-10:30: Prevention vs. Cooling Economics\n\n**Purpose**: Prove financial superiority of passive design\n\n**Setup**:\n- **Physical arrangement**: All facing screen\n- **Materials needed**: Excel with calculations, flip chart\n- **Pre-activity checks**: Calculations verified, marker ready\n\n**Script**:\n```\n\"Here's the truth that changes everything:\nPreventing heat is 30 times cheaper than removing heat.\"\n```\n\n**Live Calculation Together**:\n\n**PREVENTING 1°C Temperature Rise**:\n```\nOne-time costs:\n- Add 5cm insulation: 50,000 IQD/m²\n- For 50m² roof: 2.5 million IQD\n- Lasts 25+ years\n- Zero operating cost\n\nDaily savings: 1°C = 1 amp = 12,000 IQD/month\nPayback: 2.5M ÷ 12,000 = 3.5 months\n```\n\n**COOLING 1°C with AC**:\n```\nOngoing costs:\n- AC unit: 500,000 IQD\n- Monthly power: 30,000 IQD forever\n- Maintenance: 50,000 IQD/year\n- Replacement every 7 years\n\nTotal 25 years: 11.5 million IQD\n```\n\n**Visual on Flip Chart**:\nDraw two columns showing 3.5 month payback vs. never-ending expense\n\n**Interactive Moment**:\n\"If preventing 1°C pays back in 3.5 months, what about preventing 5°C?\"\nLet them calculate: 5 × 12,000 = 60,000 IQD/month saved\n\n**Local Context**:\n```\n\"This is why your grandmother's house works. She prevented heat \ninstead of fighting it. We call this 'passive design' - the building \ndoes the work, not machines.\"\n```\n\n**Transition**: \"Break time! After, you'll investigate these principles in action...\"\n\n[Continue with remaining activities following same detailed format...]\n\n### 10:45-12:15: Heritage Investigation Stations\n\n**Purpose**: Hands-on discovery of principles in real heritage features\n\n**Setup**:\n- **Physical arrangement**: 5 stations around room/building\n- **Materials needed**: IR guns, worksheets, measurement tools\n- **Pre-activity checks**: All stations labeled and equipped\n\n**Overall Briefing**:\n```\n\"You're now heritage detectives. Each team investigates ONE feature \nfor 20 minutes, then teaches others. Use your investigation sheets.\n\nRemember: Observe → Measure → Ask WHY → Find Principle → Modern Use\"\n```\n\n**Station Details**:\n\n**Station 1: Courtyard Effect**\n- Location: Building courtyard or model\n- Tools: IR gun, airflow ribbon\n- Investigate: Temperature differences, air movement\n- Expected discovery: Stack ventilation, evaporative cooling\n\n**Station 2: Wall Thickness**\n- Location: Exterior wall\n- Tools: IR gun, timer\n- Investigate: Inside vs outside temperatures over time\n- Expected discovery: Thermal mass delays heat\n\n**Station 3: Window Design**\n- Location: Traditional window\n- Tools: Light meter, angle finder\n- Investigate: Light levels, sun angles\n- Expected discovery: Solar control, privacy balance\n\n**Station 4: Material Comparison**\n- Location: Material samples station\n- Tools: IR gun, water dropper\n- Investigate: Temperature retention, moisture behavior\n- Expected discovery: Different materials, different properties\n\n**Station 5: Roof Intelligence**\n- Location: Roof access or photos\n- Tools: IR gun, measuring tape\n- Investigate: Colors, angles, materials\n- Expected discovery: Reflectivity, drainage, insulation\n\n**Rotation Management**:\n- 20 minutes per station\n- 5-minute transition warnings\n- All teams must complete worksheet\n- Prepare to teach findings\n\n[Document continues with remaining Day 1 activities and subsequent days in same detailed format...]",
