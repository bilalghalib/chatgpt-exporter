Think about your background in water engineering, leadership experience, and any relevant achievements.\n\n2. How do you plan to address current challenges faced by the company? This could be about navigating market changes, addressing technological advancements, or improving internal processes.\n\n3. What is your vision for the company's future? Outline your strategic goals and how you see the company evolving under your leadership.\n\n4. How will you engage with employees, stakeholders, and customers? Discuss your approach to communication and relationship-building.\n\n5. What are your plans for financial and operational sustainability? Consider how you'll balance growth with financial health and operational efficiency.\n\nReflecting on these areas will help structure your proposal and showcase why you're the right choice for this role.

And I would like some help writing a one-pager for my dad, who is the president of Water Engineering Technologies, and to ask him to invite me to take the burden of responsibility off of his shoulders, as he is now older and should be retiring, and to allow me to help him turn Water Engineering Technologies into a full-fledged business, and not just a technology production company, a company that produces technology but also knows how to diversify its sales channels, and to expand the market that it operates in, and to have a plan for the foreseeable future, and developing its organizational capacity, and hiring the design team, hiring the operations people needed, hiring the marketing people, and the economics people who can help us identify the opportunities for the technology that we are deploying that fit a market that can support it, that has the challenges that require it. So, for instance, in Iraq they have a lot of water problems, especially in terms of pollution falling into the river, as the city was built around a river, and this is also a country that is rich in oil, and also has the problem of the negative impression of the population against the government for not being proactive in resolving these issues, suggesting that the country has an increase in diseases and problems due to the pollution in the rivers, and that there is something we can do about it. So I would like to not only find places like Iraq that have the problem, that have the social pressure, that have the government interest, but I'd like to identify places that have these set of criteria, the problem, social pressure, government motivated to do something about it, and a government resource to do it, and if there are any other criteria you can help me think about, I would like to think about those and include this in a model that I add to this one pager. So that's what I'd like to do, I'd like to identify those things, I'd like to work on coming up with a business model that for the next six months, that will operate as the interim CEO, I would like to operate as the interim CEO for six months, identifying the business model, the team, the strategy, and to give my half time effort, because I don't think I can be afforded full time, and it also affords me time to explore other opportunities. This is an exploratory initial six month contract as interim CEO, where I will work to lift from Saad Buhadeb, the founder and director of water engineering technologies, a lot of the responsibility. I'd like to negotiate the contract on behalf of the team, I'd like to explore new grants, investments, and alternative deployments to other countries, and identify different sources of revenue. For instance, can we create a productizable version of the treatment plant? Is it possible to create a design team that can do design consulting for water projects around the world? Is it possible to create a variety of... For instance, we could do cell proprietary compounds and mixes that would go into the bioreactor. Can we have a R&D team that does spin-offs and sells technology? Can we find other approaches like this that will continually provide the company with the resources and funds to ensure that we have a green planet for the foreseeable future by addressing the problems of pollution and addressing any of the challenges that we have with water? So filling the water table by cleaning water and identifying these leverage points where water can have a significantly positive impact on the climate refugee crisis, the climate crisis in general. And creates a lush, verdant green earth for everyone. So having this clear vision will help us in directing our strategy in terms of identifying which parts of the world we want to work in. And I would like to work as the interim CEO on determining aligning with Saad Radeb on this vision, and then moving from there to working on the practical implementation, the hiring, the strategic design of the business vehicle, and partnerships development, funding exploration, grant writing, potential investment discussions, negotiation of contracts, and so on. I would like some help writing this all as a one-pager so that it's easy to share. And I would like to work for six months to explore this opportunity part-time as interim CEO, and that would mean that I would work for four hours a day with a checkpoint with the president of WET on Mondays and Fridays for alignment and reflection on the week's approach. So I check in on Monday and I check out on Friday and would like to be paid a CEO-level salary, except I know that the company cannot afford it right now. So I would take a pay cut with an understanding that this pay cut is a loan to WET, and WET will pay me back when we convert projects. So that's my strategy and my approach, and I'd like it to be written up as a one-pager, and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask before starting to write. What questions am I not asking? What would be an important element of this contract that isn't in the contract already? And that is all. ",

Below is a structured one-pager proposal, incorporating the details and timeline you provided:\n\n---\n\n**[Title: Proposal for Interim CEO Role at Water Engineering Technologies]**\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nDear Saad Ghalib,\n\nAs Water Engineering Technologies stands at a pivotal juncture, I, Bilal, propose stepping into the role of interim CEO. With your years of dedication and remarkable leadership, the company has flourished. However, recognizing the need for a gradual transition as you consider retirement, I am prepared to relieve you of this responsibility. My aim is to build upon your legacy, transforming our company from a technology production entity into a multifaceted business powerhouse, adept in diversification and global expansion.\n\n**Vision and Strategy:**\n\nMy vision is to steer Water Engineering Technologies towards becoming an industry leader not only in technology production but also in market diversification and environmental impact. The plan involves tapping into new markets with significant water challenges, like Iraq, where our technology can play a crucial role in addressing pollution and aiding in sustainable development.\n\n**Operational Plan:**\n\n1. **Grant Search and Team Expansion**: Commencing January 22, 2024, I will initiate a rigorous grant search to fund our expansion and start building a dynamic team comprising design, operations, marketing, and economics experts.\n\n2. **Market Expansion and Project Conversion**: By March 22, 2024, we will begin converting potential projects, like the Iraqi water treatment initiative, aligning with our vision of environmental stewardship and market growth.\n\n3. **Revenue Diversification**: Exploring avenues such as productized treatment plants, design consulting services, and proprietary bioreactor compounds, we aim to create a diverse revenue stream.\n\n4. **Environmental Impact**: Central to our mission is addressing global water pollution challenges and contributing positively to the climate crisis resolution.\n\n**Financial and Time Commitment:**\n\nAs interim CEO, I will commit four hours daily, ensuring bi-weekly alignment with you. Understanding the company's current financial constraints, I propose a CEO-level salary, considering it as a loan to the company, repayable upon successful project conversions.\n\n**Success Metrics and Exit Strategy:**\n\nProgress will be measured through grant applications, contract signings, and outreach efforts. If, by the fifth month (June 20, 2024), our targets are not on track, a meeting with you will be convened to discuss alternative strategies or leadership transitions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWith a blend of innovative strategies and a commitment to environmental and business sustainability, I am enthusiastic about guiding Water Engineering Technologies into its next chapter. This interim role presents an opportunity to demonstrate the potential for growth and impact, setting the stage for a thriving future.\n\nLooking forward to your consideration and guidance,\n\nBilal\n\n---\n\nThis proposal succinctly covers your plan, goals, and commitment, while respecting the company's current position and the legacy of your father's leadership. Feel free to make any adjustments to better fit your personal style and the company's culture.",
