      "content": "Those are hardy kiwis (Actinidia deliciosa or related species), and it’s normal that they don’t ripen fully on the vine. Here’s what you can do with your small, hard kiwis:  \n\n### 🍐 Ripening After Harvest  \n- **Pick before frost:** Harvest them while still firm, before the first frost.  \n- **Ripen indoors:** Place them in a paper bag with an apple, banana, or pear (these release ethylene gas, which speeds ripening). They should soften in a few days to weeks.  \n- **Refrigerate for storage:** Keep them in the fridge for months, then ripen small batches at room temperature when you want to eat them.  \n\n### 🥧 Ways to Use Them Unripe  \nIf they stay small and tart even after ripening:  \n- **Chutney or relish** – Cook them with onions, vinegar, and spices.  \n- **Jam or preserves** – Their tartness works well for a tangy spread.  \n- **Fermentation** – You can try making kiwi wine or vinegar.  \n- **Pickled kiwis** – Slice thin and pickle like green tomatoes.  \n\n### 🌱 Why They Stay Small  \n- They might be an **ornamental or hardy kiwi variety** (Actinidia arguta or Actinidia kolomikta), which naturally bear smaller fruit.  \n- They may also need a **pollinator vine** nearby, since kiwis are usually dioecious (male and female plants separate). Without pollination, the fruit often stays small and doesn’t ripen well.  \n\n👉 Do you want me to give you a step-by-step on how to test-ripen a small batch right now so you know if they’ll sweeten up or if you should cook them?",
