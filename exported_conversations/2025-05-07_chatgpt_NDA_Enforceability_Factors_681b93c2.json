      "content": "The enforceability of a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) you sent to someone who signed it depends on several factors, including:\n\n### 1. **Jurisdiction & Governing Law**\n- NDAs are subject to local laws. If your NDA specifies a jurisdiction (e.g., “This agreement is governed by the laws of California”), that state or country’s laws will generally apply.\n- Some jurisdictions are more likely to enforce NDAs than others, especially regarding employment or trade secrets.\n\n### 2. **Consideration**\n- There must be something of value exchanged (e.g., access to confidential info, a job offer, a collaboration opportunity). Without this, a court may find it unenforceable.\n\n### 3. **Reasonableness of Scope**\n- Courts assess **what information is protected**, **for how long**, and **under what circumstances**. Overly broad, vague, or indefinite NDAs are often struck down or limited.\n\n### 4. **Clear Definition of Confidential Information**\n- The NDA should clearly define what is considered confidential. If it's too vague, it may not hold up in court.\n\n### 5. **No Illegal Clauses**\n- Clauses that violate public policy (e.g., trying to hide illegal activities) are not enforceable.\n\n### 6. **Actual Damages or Threat of Harm**\n- Enforceability also depends on your ability to show that you were harmed or could be harmed by a breach. Courts often require evidence of real damage or risk.\n\nIf your NDA was well-drafted, signed, and there’s a clear exchange of value, it’s likely to be enforceable in many contexts—particularly in protecting trade secrets, business plans, or sensitive personal data.\n\nWould you like to check a specific clause for enforceability?",

      "content": "If you're an American company and the person who signed your NDA is based in India, enforceability becomes **international** in scope, and you need to consider **cross-border legal complexities**. Here's what matters most:\n\n### 1. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction Clause**\n- Your NDA **should explicitly state** which country's laws govern the agreement and where disputes will be resolved.\n    - Example: *“This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of [New York], and disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts in [New York].”*\n- If this clause is missing or unclear, the agreement may be harder to enforce.\n\n### 2. **Enforcing in India**\n- Even if a U.S. court rules in your favor, you will likely need to **enforce the judgment in India** to collect damages or get an injunction.\n- India **does not automatically enforce U.S. judgments**. You must file a suit in India under Section 13 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code and prove the U.S. judgment meets specific criteria (e.g., fair trial, not contrary to Indian public policy).\n\n### 3. **Alternative: Arbitration**\n- If your NDA includes an **arbitration clause**, especially one compliant with the **New York Convention**, it may be easier to enforce the result in India.\n    - India is a signatory to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.\n\n### 4. **Practical Strategy**\n- If you’re dealing with confidential IP or trade secrets, consider having the NDA **executed under Indian law** as well (or a **dual jurisdiction clause**) and/or work with an Indian lawyer to create a local version.\n- You may also want to **limit data access** until a strong, enforceable agreement is in place.\n\nWould you like help reviewing or drafting such an NDA for cross-border enforcement?",
