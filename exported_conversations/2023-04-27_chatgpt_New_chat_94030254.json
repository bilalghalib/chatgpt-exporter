      "content": "Yes, if you are applying for an expedited passport renewal at the Chicago Passport Agency, you generally need to provide proof of international travel within the next 14 days (or within 30 days if a visa is also required for your destination). This helps the agency prioritize applications and expedite processing for those with urgent needs.\n\nAcceptable forms of proof of travel include:\n\n1. A copy of your round-trip airline tickets or flight itinerary showing your name, the dates of travel, and the destination(s).\n2. A copy of a cruise ship ticket or itinerary with your name, the dates of travel, and the destination(s).\n3. A confirmed hotel reservation with your name, the dates of travel, and the destination(s).\n4. An official letter from an employer or organization (on letterhead) stating the need for urgent international travel, with specific dates and destinations.\n5. A letter from a medical professional or institution, indicating a need for urgent medical treatment in another country, with specific dates and destinations.\n\nKeep in mind that requirements can change over time, so it's always a good idea to check the official U.S. Department of State website or contact the Chicago Passport Agency directly for the most up-to-date information before you go.",

      "content": "Yes, in most cases, a digital copy of your proof of international travel will be accepted at the Chicago Passport Agency. You can either bring a printed copy of your travel documents or show them on your phone or other electronic device.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to double-check with the Chicago Passport Agency or the U.S. Department of State to make sure that digital copies will be accepted for your specific situation. Some travel documents, such as visas, may need to be presented in their original form, so it's important to verify the requirements beforehand to avoid any delays or complications in the passport renewal process.",
