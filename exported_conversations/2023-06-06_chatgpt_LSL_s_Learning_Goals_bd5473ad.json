      "content": "what are their learning goals:\nLebanese Spotlight Youth (LSL) was founded in 2017 by a small group of dedicated individuals in Beirut. Despite economic and social challenges, LSL has grown to include 350 volunteers who are passionate about helping vulnerable citizens and making a difference in their communities. As the founder, my three learning goals are: motivating more youth to join LSL, effectively engaging the community, and ensuring financial sustainability. By emphasizing personal growth and the opportunity to create positive change, we aim to inspire youth to be part of LSL. Through community engagement strategies, such as needs assessments and partnerships with local organizations, we can align our initiatives with community priorities. To sustain LSL, we will diversify funding sources, seek grants and sponsorships, and explore innovative fundraising ideas. With a focus on these goals, LSL can expand its impact and empower more youth to contribute to their communities.",
