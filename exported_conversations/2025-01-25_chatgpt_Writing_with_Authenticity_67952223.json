      "content": "Can you take this Contant and make it so that it’s an a narrative essay you can add some headings you can slightly shift the organization of the Contant so that it’s some kind of cohesive and flows well trying to not change the language on the text and keep it with my authentic boys keep it as minimally altered in the text as possible just structure it add some headings and some titles and turn this Freeform narratives that I gave with my voice into and more of like a Storey or an essay that I can share: [[[Okay, so we're going to be writing an essay with our voice because one of my skills and competencies and something that I pride myself in is my ability to follow a thread clearly and coherently and articulated, and this content must be mine and come from my heart and not be external and also it must be connected to all realities. It's my intention that this becomes a snapshot of my thinking about the truths that I've discovered in my life and the realities they imply towards a good life and how that impacts the sense of speed, rush, fear, otherness, alienation, and impending disaster with the climate, the wars the mistrust of our neighbors and the lack of time and space and knowledge of what to do with ourselves. I'm indebted to my mom who shared with me in October of 2011 their aid prayer from Mecca, and in that prayer there was a talk and in that talk the speaker, shared the idea that God is beautiful, and he loves that which is beautiful and in that time, I was very hurt and unable to accept all of the tradition that I had been raised with because it was getting in the way of me trusting my heart, and that tension the reality that this person I respected and admired was some one that my heart honestly could lean towards and brought me aliveness was fighting with the textual reality of the lack of an articulated Islam or Christianity that I could check some box in an accounting system with the god and with my family to say that this woman is a Muslim and therefore I am allowed to have these feelings. rather than the fear, hope, trepidation, openness, wonder anticipation heart opening heart racing, mind spinning possibility, of accepting love.  I remember laying down on the ground outside and she asked me, do you love me? and rather than taking a moment to take a deep breath to look inside of my heart, and to say the truth of what I found, I deflected. I asked for literalism.  I asked how do you define love? There are places within us that know love that can distinguish love from lust and in my confusion and desire to be confused to avoid the pain and the stress and the fear of confronting my family and confronting the check box guard and religion that I had invented that wasn't the true way of interpreting are the only way I deflected and created confusion in my life and compounded that confusion for years and years I allowed myself in that confusion to create a shadow and to have the part of me that was alive to live in that shadow. I nook out of the house in the dark to be able to be with the parts of me that were actually alive and I lived like a zombie, having not slept and like a zombie because in the day I was living waiting for the night distant from my heart, distant from the thing that knows the truths of the world and the truths within myself. and in October 2011 I was given one of the keys of a trifecta that allowed me to open my heart and to connect reintegrate with my emotions, with my feelings, with my perception of beauty, with my sense of meaning and sense of self, and ultimately, at long last, the realizations that beauty is the splendor of truth. and beauty is that which draws you into love, and that the perception and recognition of beauty is a part of a faculty that is inextricable from that perception and that reality.  This faculty within us that sees beauty is the place where we can answer the questions of what is true and the confusions that we might have about what is actually good How should we live? What is real? My background as someone who loves science and technology and philosophy and rationalizations.  I think connects to this desire for control and this lack of engaging with the fear and the reality of the bird that when it wakes up and opens its eyes and sees its hungry children, and leaves its nest in fear and hope, seeking the worms, the seeds, the sustenance and the awe in the wonder and the gratitude and the aliveness at finding it. This way of seeing the world and living in the world requires both eyes, we do have a rational faculty We can think ahead to plant seeds now to organize our land, to let land rest after understanding soil depletion so that we can have a better harvest next year and I've realized that this love of planning and stability along with my rejection of the tradition that was brought to me that was teaching me how to open the eye of the heart. limited me from being able to explore in an open way, and the only way that's real on the tight rope of life to keep my eyes focused on beauty and to walk without looking down knowing and not knowing that the next step is going to land and that will be okay and that will make it. because the rope is invisible to the tight rope walker. It's just sensed, just like the worm is invisible to the bird. and in the muslin tradition were given many promises of what happens to those who trust and have god consciousness that these are those that are successful.  And these beliefs I think must be taken gradually, step by step. You take one step, that proves the rope is there, you leave one morning, you find the worms, but winter comes, things change, the wind blows, and the rope moves ever so slightly. and so I believe that it's not that we must avoid planning planting the seeds and using our mind, but that we need as a society to traverse this canyon. We are in a place where our stasis is destructive, our not changing is damaging, and I believe the roots of why staying the same is damaging is connected to the roots that have alienated us from this perception of beauty and truth and goodness, and even trusting that this means something that it's not an emotion only that it may have states ways that are uplifting inspire us.  You watch a movie about Nelson Mandela and you leave uplifted the sense of possibility and hope and maybe you think to yourself, how can I be a little more like that? And so the first thing that happened to me after my partner broke up with me because I could not face the fear. of the reality that was being that was beckoning the reality of I love this person and I don't know what to do. I'm young I don't know my faith.  I don't know myself. I don't know what love actually means. that love is the splendor of truth and that beauty and truth and love come together and that if I wanted to know God and how to live I have to read all three books the book of revelation, the book of inner insight and looking within our feelings, our thoughts, even our negative ruminations, and the book of the outer world the beauty of a river flowing down a mountain and a waterfall, and fish below in a clear pond eating the bugs on the river and then if you follow that river as it passes through human civilization on the other side, you look again into the water, and you find ugliness, a weird slimy color, a film on the top of the water potentially dead fish, a bad smell it repulses you. and why is that the case? How is this also true and how is that assign?  These signs of repulsion could have prevented us from continuing down this path the they would say the smell of London in the 1800s the squalor the tight neighborhoods with sewage flowing down the middle and Jack the Ripper and the pollution bellowing into the air and kids coming home in the morning after working at night shift in a factory and injuries and I'm sure people knew this wasn't beautiful. yet it helped increase the sense of control because there was a a power to it that could be grown resources accumulating into the hands of the owners allowing more allocating according to their desires and whims, unchecked and unpurified and unhe held up against the example of beauty and this alienation from the things that make life meaningful, require us to fill it with a hope that the future will be better. I don't feel so good right now, but I believe in this progress that we're making, this idea of progress links in deeply with this idea of how the reward system within us works. our sense of accomplishments and reward and the molecule dopamine that symbolizes it is not from achievement. It's not from making a goal and accomplishing it.  The reward comes from the expectation of a good, and so as long as we were able to tell ourselves in each other, this world might not be good to day, but to morrow it will be better when technology improves when we're able to extract more from less when we have to work less, this claim that, you know, we increase productivity and somehow work less and enjoy more is not what has happened at all. We've increased productivity and working hours, and at the same time we're reducing wages. This confusion about what is good, what do we want from life, this sense of mastery has been possible for only 200300 years and it was made possible from the primary disconnect from people with some their core faculty that is able to see and then the practice of implementing the seeing of beauty into a cycle of life that shows that you can take another step on that tight rope towards a more beautiful future and instead we went into a command and control into a cycle of allowing the things that think a we are able to control our situation and preserve our station and expand our domination and to manage people and the planet and the colonies and to do all of this in a way where we start having the science of productivity and the science of the polity and political science and we have this illusion of being able to get what we want without ever opening the eyes within us that can know what we actually want, and with only one eye, we can only see what we think we want, our needs, our fears, our expectations, and we try to address those, but it's it's a bottomless pit because the only thing that can really fill those is the eye that is able to see our true desires for love, beauty, connection, and the things that are truly satisfying.  And so what happens as we fall into lust or we fall into gluttony, or we fall into laziness, and we build escalators, and then when our bodies start falling apart, we go to the gym. And so understanding that dohamine is this reward molecule, I think is really important to see why we always imagine heaven as to morrow and that promise that things will be better, I think, kept people in a cage of anticipation and patience. of gritting our teeth kind of patience, but then, as we see in to day's world, we see that our uncontrolled, desire for control has expanded our unbeautiful ways of being into manipulating more of the world into ugliness into factories that fall on the people working to make our clothes and into promoting consumption just to be able to maintain the systems into this problematic situation that we find ourselves in that I think really is exemplified by this disconnect between this faculty that knows what is actually good and beautiful rather than the faculty that sees and wants for oneself, it's the faculty that sees and in that seeing can be satisfied in the connection and relating and and then we can talk very plainly about the rise of suicide. uh being one of the leading causes of death for young people, the beginning of suicides in preteens, which is unthinkable and it is kind of vague sense of anxiety they say that in the last 30 years the levels of anxiety have skyrocketed around the world, and we're coming to a place where I think we have to open that other eye. And I think so many people know this and part of the taste of it was during the pandemic when people uh were unable to go to the work that they were distracted by they started making sour dough, right?  connecting to the arts and to the crafts and to sharing, like you don't make a whole loaf of sourdough and eat it by yourself, and you don't even make the sourdough by yourself, you make it in collaboration with the yeast, and you wait and there's this recognition of a beauty in working with systems, working within and for systems, and they might think of it as a silly example, but as more people looked into their own lives and asked like, I'm at home and I'm with myself. What what should we do? You know people read books.  Maybe for the first time in a long time. and began to touch the parts of themselves that, you know, like when you really immersed in a book, you have a sense of it. It's not the facts of the text and the page that you're reading adding up to a narrative that you have in your mind and some kind of system of social relations that maps on to how you connect with faces and people and no, there's like there there there is a way we need to point at this reality that there's parts of us that know that I believe have been gas lit and undermined and doubted because it's not convenient. just like I couldn't say I love you to a person I loved because it would damage my relationship with my family, my self identity as a Muslim who didn't really know his religion or tradition. I think we all are unable to realize that it's way better to be that bird than to go out until eat the worm in awe and in wonder and defeat our family and to love, and to be alive, then to have complete and utter control, you know, Elon Musk and some of these transhumanists are trying to plug computers into our brains and give us, you know, cognitive capacities that far surpass what we're able to and we have to go to Mars and colonize because we want to preserve consciousness.  And these may not be the worst ideas, but we have to ask like, what's the Tological conclusion, you know? this idea of ad Astura to the stars, right, is highly motivating for many thoughtful, philosophical, wealthy, intelligent, computer science majors who have went into silicon Valley and made money somehow, like this idea of the beauty and discovery, although the beauty of nature and looking at the heavens is also connected to this realization of the grandeur of it that felt sense of oh my God, this is incredible and I get to be here and witness and the humility of seeing signs everywhere, you know, verses the kind of logical conclusion we get from how people are trying to cure death. and live forever, leading to this realization that if they had their way, what would be better then dividing the entire universe into matter that will produce energy for the conscious machines and machines that experience the ultimate pleasure constantly, you know, in the world of the effective altruists, they are talking about these things. They're talking about like, is this the most beautiful future we can imagine, which is ultra hedonistic consciousness that has colonized the entire universe and and then what, right?  and the idea of what is beautiful in every moment has infinite faces and your response in every moment can respond in a beautiful way of of infinite path gives you the infinity that we seek and the participation in a chorus and a choir in the moment right now. and sure we might have to protect ourselves if an asteroid is coming and gonna wipe out humanity, having Mars be a planet for us could be an interesting thing as an ultimate backup, but if you look at it, you know wires doesn't have a magnetic field, it would have to have a colony that is encapsulated and food grown in greenhouses and importing much from the earth. And sure it may be over time generations and generations or talking thousands of years since we live forever, it can become a habitable planet through our innovation and our our work, but I also think there is something important about knowing what the right thing to do is and the dangers. Those dangers, the vast majority of the existential dangers that Elon Musk is talking about are because we can't live together in peace on earth, and that comes about because of this lack of recognition, of a foundational faculty and perception that knows the whole that has access to seeing the end state of the entire complex system that they're trying to model and can inform us what is a beautiful way of being through residence, through self-reflection, through self understanding, and this perception directs our attention.  We can think of it like we're wr rung like a bell, and then we can hear what color or what sound we are, right? We don't know that we're a bell in the key of c or that we're a marimba and the key of sea or something. but that perception that we have that is connected to all people's perceptions of beauty and our perception of beauty and truth and love and goodness, that thing is able to inform our actions with humility rather than arrogance. All of our complex systems are false.  They measure tiny fraction of the reality, but we have access to the thing that tells us the now good thing if we can remove some of our biases and our pensions for self preservation, and if we do these things, we don't need to go to Mars. immediately sure our son will explode so we have to have options and sure that knowledge of what the universe is like will continue to evolve and, you know, the asteroid might be coming and I hope we detect it. I don't want to have this moment of looking up and feeling like I didn't live, you know, and if we look up and we're on the process of building our Mars colony, but the rockets haven't launched yet. Imagine the ultimate regret, the pain and the suffering, the infinite moment of agony if the rockets start falling, someone accidentally pushed the red button. and the opposite, imagine if you were trying your best to listen to the one thing that knows everything that also tells you how you can best use your gifts, your pensions, your natural inclinations, your place in the world, the relationships you have. to act in harmony with that, and if more people did this and connected with that part of us, if I didn't say please define love so that I can make sure that on Mars we have a checklist of loving people if I said, I feel deeply that I love you and I'm scared and I don't know what to do about it.  We could have had a very different conversation life would have been very different, but because I had that experience, I have a lesson. and I have a story and thankfully I have a turnaround because in 2004, I met the person whom I love today. And when I met her, the relationship didn't make sense. She was from a different part of the world.  She spoke a different language. We didn't resonate and play off of each other's creativity. wasn't a strong, you know, desire for intimacy was different. But I decided finally, for once in my life, I'm not going to think my way into a relationship and say, what will my parents think?  Does this make sense, according to the religion I was given? That was supposed to tell me who God was and how we want to live, and instead trust the thing that religions try to connect you with that part of us that can know truth. and when I met my wife and I held her, my shoulders dropped, I felt connected to my body and to her and there was a leaning towards there was a yes. And this is very early in our relationship. and so somehow I also kind of believe there's a non-emporal nature to that viewing, that complex system isn't just telling the story of the now that complex system that oneness is everything and every time and telling you now how to be a part of the beautiful story that wants to happen, and it's possible to listen to that.  And it requires only to trust small experiments towards becoming beautiful, and to think through logically and understand who we actually want to be. What are the worldviews that we've taken on? What are the schemas, the frameworks?  What do you think your feelings are? What do they imply? What do they mean?  Are they random? Why is it impossible to be satisfied? with so many options on Amazon and deliveroo and tinder What's happening?  What is good? I gave a talk once called good as hard. and it was about two people who chose two ways of being for two very different reasons. One chose it out of love love for their patience and developed the lobotomy, something that we now look back at and realize its tragedy, but in his time, his love defined its use case.  It was only for the most severe cases when nothing else would work, and it was only to protect themselves from themselves and their families. and it worked. The challenges people monopolized this procedure because they found a hack to do it faster and simpler and make it more efficient, and rather than risking life and having to make an incision in the skull and realize the immensity of that decision, they were able to use a thin metal stick and to use the tear duct behind the uh, right on top of the eye and to break the thin bone very easily at the back of the a bit lobe and and to conduct a lobotomy and the reasoning wasn't how best to help our patients was it let it became how can we do as many of these as possible for financial gain? and then people came back from world War II, injured and traumatized, and this rational way of thinking, this efficiency oriented way of thinking led to many more lobotomies being made than were needed, and Fritzaber, who out of fear and a desire for the longing and acceptance in a German state as a Jewish scientist decided he must solve the problem of the lack of fertilizers which were being blockaded from South America for the bombs that Germany wanted to make to kill, to conquer, to expand, to control.  And so in order to feel and to connect and to be a part of that society as someone who is at risk in that society as a Jewish person, he found a way to be useful to a death machine by creating the nitrogen fixing process. His nitrogen fixing process came from and an optimization of death. How can we make bombs out thinner?  And this technology became what fed our planet because we were able to create massively bulked produce around the world because we had nitrogen-based fertilizers that were easy to manufacture and produce, and so he wanted over a price and so did at germonitz, the inventor the lobotomy. Both of these people on stage receiving the novel Prius, must have felt differently. It must have been confusing, I imagine, for Fritzaber after the war, having his technology been used for other more humane purposes, but there seems to be something about this efficiency mindset, this orientation for something from nothing that requires nothing of us to be to extract out of thin air rather than to participate in the systems of guano and animals and digging in the dirt and people involvements and all of that rather than this mechanized world that turns air into little white pellets, and we see now that those nitrogen fertilizers are being overused are food is less nutritious the water in the Mississippi takes all that run off from the farms and creates a giant dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing can live. and initially, when I first gave this talk, I was still confused.  I didn't realize that good is hard, meant that it's possible too, know what is good, but you have to stay connected to the part of you that sees, and so innovate, invent the lobotomy, but for all of us that want to apply it, we have to apply it with that connection to both efficiency, rationality, optimization, protection, systems, and the part that knows goodness and beauty. And that part that knows goodness and beauty is a step back and it requires us to step back, requires us to look at the looking and to see what we're doing and to ask, and we know these things. I think in communities where we are mirrors to each other and this is why I've been working on this process that I call come alive because our lives depend on it.  I work in social entrepreneurship and social change and impact, and I realize the challenge that we have of instrumentalizing people, we have a perverse intent incentive sometimes when you see that we need problems to exist for our businesses to exist, so do we really want to solve it. rather than the business existing taking second priority to doing something that helps us come alive and give and just like that rope is real, just like the bird leaves and trusts and knows that like we live in a beautiful planet and we know it, you know. As long as we accept that we're a part of this amazing place in these systems, as long as we stay within these systems of nurturing life and give back to them as much as we take in a sense like staying beautiful, I think there is a way into safety and into old age and in whatever is beyond, just like the bird, the good the bird does for the trees that it eats its seeds is it spreads its seeds and its poop and so sometimes when we are deeply integrated in loving ways with each other and the systems that provide life, and we are coming alive even our accidental byproducts can be sources of life. And when we reduce our need for systems and for savings accounts and retirement funds, I really believe that life supports that which supports life. and getting into these ways of being in harmony and perceiving and pursuing that which is beautiful meaningful and true connecting our eye of rationality, where our eyes of intentional submission to the good, I think we're gonna be okay. that we will be able to change in this dynamic ever changing time because that is the nature of aliveness. the fear of the future, the rate of change, is a problem for Stasis, not of a liveness.  It doesn't matter if we get holographic lenses and, you know, telepresence at some point It's going to be okay. We will know how to live then because we will be able to know the thing that is timeless within us that brings the new way of being now that we're being wr rung again that my bell is in the key of C, and this is what it looks like here, echoing off of the auditorium malls. And so I think it sounds crazy.  I think I tried to do a good job explaining my personal experience. The philosophical rigor behind it, the logical sense that it makes the historical disconnect from Descartes and Galileo, and the consequences of materialism leading to the accruel of more material to capitalism, to neolioliberalism, and the consequences of these mindsets. stemming from a hyper focus of a single part of our rational and perceptual faculties, and that all the other forms of currency that are possible and wealth that are possible, and a fourth dimension in time, along with the other three, that expands because we have access to an infinite unfolding that is clear and is evoked in everyone's life at some point if they ask for their sources of meaning, like tell me about a meaningful moment what was happening. What were you attending to?  And in doing that we can clarify one of the ways that the infinite goodness and beauty wants to enter into this world into time through you and if we do that, and we tell these stories, I think we can be our own role model and the role model for each other. We can uplift through not self sacrifice and do well and do good or whatever. It's just do good and do well, you know?  We have to flip it. do well and trust that we will do good and that good might not look like the same million dollar bank account retirement fund where you can escape climate collapse, living in New Zealand that good might be dealing with climate collapse knee deepened the flooding waters, bailing people out of their homes and planting gardens on rooftops. That could be your good. That could be your safety.  That could be a life that you love not a life that is safe and protected. And these ways of talking about values and these ways of thinking are derived from my interpretation of Sufi metaphysics and Islamic philosophy, from Joe Edelman's work on attentional policies and sources of meaning derived also inspired by Charles Taylor and my interaction in silicon Valley and growing concern and feeling of distance from the ways I used to think and I was, you know, at some point wanting to create good with technology and it wasn't working. And then I thought, okay, well, social enterprise and it's not working.  Um, what's good, you know, and I wasn't feeling good and we were rushing and racing and I really believe that we cannot create good until we are good ourselves and a part of that is letting some of our fears go, our desire for self-p protection and trusting more and that we will get the things that we want. when we direct our soldiers ourselves towards the things that we want to give now, we see how the beauty wants to unfold in our lives, how goodness wants to unfold and that it's not about sacrificing our life to create a fair trade coffee company and make less money, but be good for the planet or being good. It's not about being good by our actions and our decisions. It's about letting goodness be us, letting the goodness flow, and we know that through inspirational stories and even stories in our own lives and can we really trust that this will lead us to being just the right thing at just the right time?  I've always been inspired by the quote, don't ask what the world needs, ask. what makes you come alive because the world needs more people that have come alive and that's from Howard Thurman, one of the Christian theologians that have inspired. Martin Luther King Jr. and I believe that and I didn't know why it was true until I said deeply reflecting on it and realizing that this coming alive is related to humility and that humility is also related to learning, and that all of this is connected through one of these models that you can think of similar to the flow state. There is, you know, complexity of task and skill as axes and there's like this Goldilock zone in the metal where it's just out of reach for you, right?  And this idea that we can place ourselves in over our heads and places where we don't have the skills competencies, networks, relationships, understanding, because we think it's good and create a mess and waste investors, money and waste our life and our time versus who am I and what is the most beautiful thing that I am connected to, that I see, that wants to flow through me. am I that person that, you know, has aension for medicine and studied and and loves it and and it comes easily to me and I strive and I'm at that growth edge constantly, but also knowing that there's so much more to learn and and then maybe, if you were in the fifties, you might be the right person. if you felt care and concern for your patience to give somebody a lobotomy if they had to have one, maybe that's the most beautiful thing you could have done then. But then now, as we think about our actions and trying to find product market fit or what the world needs, or look at the SDGs because smart people at the UN design this system rationally and they have indicators and measures for everything, but everyone becomes a means to an end, even if that end is to have a thriving productive business that solves one of the challenges of the SDGs, it is using people's misery or the planet's suffering for the preservation of a system that can address it, and part of that system is the preservation of your life and its financial needs within the system versus integrating into that moment an I see it as like a bottom up and a top down. It's not that I don't like SDGs, but I think we should count SDGs after the fact.  We should be encouraging people uplifting them, asking them what they need to learn with skills, what do they see, how do they want to respond, letting the world be the classroom so that they find their growth edge and how they're going to be participating in all times and let them develop this care and this love and this aesthetic sense, and let them connect to the arts and let them know what beauty feels like and let them connect to wonder and their let's not destroy their sense of curiosity and experimentation and expansion, and let that contrast with the trip to the landfill or to the Ganges river and and let them see what rings inside of them then, you know explore tell the world your story, the story of yourself have authentic action. I remember when I was younger I was working in Iraq and suddenly there was interest from international NGO's to fund women in tech businesses, and they popped up everywhere. And I'm wondering to today how many of them remained you know, they can evolve, they might evolve, they should evolve because the nature is a constant unflow unfolding of infinity into reality when you're connected to that place where beauty comes, and you can't stand still.  You will fall behind. You must be open daily, and it's a practice daily to unfold your wings to come down and to look, and to see what new blessings are brought and to feel grateful you know, we are talking about, you know, gratitude practices, practices, but a gratitude practice is sometimes not going to be able to touch people because there is also the practice of stability, safety and protection and I deserve this, which is the complete opposite of ingratitude. It's this expectation, it's this entitlement and entitlement comes with the same mind that says, I did rather than I saw and I responded, and this shift so important because we cannot see and respond if we don't have that faculty which we do, and I think with my process of just asking people to look at their to do lists and to find the tensions within it because I believe that we are always seeing there.  And so all the things that we're doing are either aligned with that or not, some of them will bring us to life and bring us joy, and some of us won't. Some of those things that are to do that we do because we have to, and we're not questioning, but with a little bit of insight, some questioning, looking at the why behind the things, we can see which part of us we're emphasizing and until their imbalance our way of seeing the world quantitatively a way of seeing the world of entitlement to life only if and when we have clearly created value that is described through dollars otherwise irrit charity case, and there is shame and guilt involved in here until we change that by balancing that way of seeing of doing, of acting, of with the way of receiving, I realizing now that all of what I'm saying is very Taoist sounding, but even just a little bit of Taoism. you have all that yang just put that dot of yin in there, you know, and see what happens and then maybe slowly you can dive into that and come out the other side in a world of yen and then be able to shrink back when it's time for prioritization, and I think Barbara Frederickson and her work on Broden and build can be another scientifically backed way of both philosophically and scientifically understanding how pursuing these expansive states makes it possible for you to be more yourself in the right place at the right time doing the right thing and be supported and get all the things that you wanted in a way where you can receive them. I think this problem with receiving is also a problem with how we're trying to get our needs meant.  And so here I am in France, having been unable to accept the love that wants to flow through me and now I have a baby. and I'm here with my wife and that inkling of maybe this is the person has become more and more true as our love has grown more and more deep, because we are looking together towards that which invites beauty into our lives, and this openness to a meaningful life, a deeper conversation, and uh lots of forgiveness has been a blessing and what I'm working towards in my life is for success to be every step. This little framework might rhyme with the act, therapy framework, and another frameworks, but I hope the story and this way of thinking is convincing and I'm curious if there's any critiques or ways of seeing that I am missing that can either improve it or change it or show me another way that I would find beautiful. So I hope you're having a beautiful day.  And that you're opening up day by day to that which makes you come alive.]]]",

      "content": "Can you take this Contant and make it so that it’s an a narrative essay you can add some headings you can slightly shift the organization of the Contant so that it’s some kind of cohesive and flows well trying to not change the language on the text and keep it with my authentic boys keep it as minimally altered in the text as possible just structure it add some headings and some titles and turn this Freeform narratives that I gave with my voice into and more of like a Storey or an essay that I can share: [[[Okay, so we're going to be writing an essay with our voice because one of my skills and competencies and something that I pride myself in is my ability to follow a thread clearly and coherently and articulated, and this content must be mine and come from my heart and not be external and also it must be connected to all realities. It's my intention that this becomes a snapshot of my thinking about the truths that I've discovered in my life and the realities they imply towards a good life and how that impacts the sense of speed, rush, fear, otherness, alienation, and impending disaster with the climate, the wars the mistrust of our neighbors and the lack of time and space and knowledge of what to do with ourselves. I'm indebted to my mom who shared with me in October of 2011 their aid prayer from Mecca, and in that prayer there was a talk and in that talk the speaker, shared the idea that God is beautiful, and he loves that which is beautiful and in that time, I was very hurt and unable to accept all of the tradition that I had been raised with because it was getting in the way of me trusting my heart, and that tension the reality that this person I respected and admired was some one that my heart honestly could lean towards and brought me aliveness was fighting with the textual reality of the lack of an articulated Islam or Christianity that I could check some box in an accounting system with the god and with my family to say that this woman is a Muslim and therefore I am allowed to have these feelings. rather than the fear, hope, trepidation, openness, wonder anticipation heart opening heart racing, mind spinning possibility, of accepting love.  I remember laying down on the ground outside and she asked me, do you love me? and rather than taking a moment to take a deep breath to look inside of my heart, and to say the truth of what I found, I deflected. I asked for literalism.  I asked how do you define love? There are places within us that know love that can distinguish love from lust and in my confusion and desire to be confused to avoid the pain and the stress and the fear of confronting my family and confronting the check box guard and religion that I had invented that wasn't the true way of interpreting are the only way I deflected and created confusion in my life and compounded that confusion for years and years I allowed myself in that confusion to create a shadow and to have the part of me that was alive to live in that shadow. I nook out of the house in the dark to be able to be with the parts of me that were actually alive and I lived like a zombie, having not slept and like a zombie because in the day I was living waiting for the night distant from my heart, distant from the thing that knows the truths of the world and the truths within myself. and in October 2011 I was given one of the keys of a trifecta that allowed me to open my heart and to connect reintegrate with my emotions, with my feelings, with my perception of beauty, with my sense of meaning and sense of self, and ultimately, at long last, the realizations that beauty is the splendor of truth. and beauty is that which draws you into love, and that the perception and recognition of beauty is a part of a faculty that is inextricable from that perception and that reality.  This faculty within us that sees beauty is the place where we can answer the questions of what is true and the confusions that we might have about what is actually good How should we live? What is real? My background as someone who loves science and technology and philosophy and rationalizations.  I think connects to this desire for control and this lack of engaging with the fear and the reality of the bird that when it wakes up and opens its eyes and sees its hungry children, and leaves its nest in fear and hope, seeking the worms, the seeds, the sustenance and the awe in the wonder and the gratitude and the aliveness at finding it. This way of seeing the world and living in the world requires both eyes, we do have a rational faculty We can think ahead to plant seeds now to organize our land, to let land rest after understanding soil depletion so that we can have a better harvest next year and I've realized that this love of planning and stability along with my rejection of the tradition that was brought to me that was teaching me how to open the eye of the heart. limited me from being able to explore in an open way, and the only way that's real on the tight rope of life to keep my eyes focused on beauty and to walk without looking down knowing and not knowing that the next step is going to land and that will be okay and that will make it. because the rope is invisible to the tight rope walker. It's just sensed, just like the worm is invisible to the bird. and in the muslin tradition were given many promises of what happens to those who trust and have god consciousness that these are those that are successful.  And these beliefs I think must be taken gradually, step by step. You take one step, that proves the rope is there, you leave one morning, you find the worms, but winter comes, things change, the wind blows, and the rope moves ever so slightly. and so I believe that it's not that we must avoid planning planting the seeds and using our mind, but that we need as a society to traverse this canyon. We are in a place where our stasis is destructive, our not changing is damaging, and I believe the roots of why staying the same is damaging is connected to the roots that have alienated us from this perception of beauty and truth and goodness, and even trusting that this means something that it's not an emotion only that it may have states ways that are uplifting inspire us.  You watch a movie about Nelson Mandela and you leave uplifted the sense of possibility and hope and maybe you think to yourself, how can I be a little more like that? And so the first thing that happened to me after my partner broke up with me because I could not face the fear. of the reality that was being that was beckoning the reality of I love this person and I don't know what to do. I'm young I don't know my faith.  I don't know myself. I don't know what love actually means. that love is the splendor of truth and that beauty and truth and love come together and that if I wanted to know God and how to live I have to read all three books the book of revelation, the book of inner insight and looking within our feelings, our thoughts, even our negative ruminations, and the book of the outer world the beauty of a river flowing down a mountain and a waterfall, and fish below in a clear pond eating the bugs on the river and then if you follow that river as it passes through human civilization on the other side, you look again into the water, and you find ugliness, a weird slimy color, a film on the top of the water potentially dead fish, a bad smell it repulses you. and why is that the case? How is this also true and how is that assign?  These signs of repulsion could have prevented us from continuing down this path the they would say the smell of London in the 1800s the squalor the tight neighborhoods with sewage flowing down the middle and Jack the Ripper and the pollution bellowing into the air and kids coming home in the morning after working at night shift in a factory and injuries and I'm sure people knew this wasn't beautiful. yet it helped increase the sense of control because there was a a power to it that could be grown resources accumulating into the hands of the owners allowing more allocating according to their desires and whims, unchecked and unpurified and unhe held up against the example of beauty and this alienation from the things that make life meaningful, require us to fill it with a hope that the future will be better. I don't feel so good right now, but I believe in this progress that we're making, this idea of progress links in deeply with this idea of how the reward system within us works. our sense of accomplishments and reward and the molecule dopamine that symbolizes it is not from achievement. It's not from making a goal and accomplishing it.  The reward comes from the expectation of a good, and so as long as we were able to tell ourselves in each other, this world might not be good to day, but to morrow it will be better when technology improves when we're able to extract more from less when we have to work less, this claim that, you know, we increase productivity and somehow work less and enjoy more is not what has happened at all. We've increased productivity and working hours, and at the same time we're reducing wages. This confusion about what is good, what do we want from life, this sense of mastery has been possible for only 200300 years and it was made possible from the primary disconnect from people with some their core faculty that is able to see and then the practice of implementing the seeing of beauty into a cycle of life that shows that you can take another step on that tight rope towards a more beautiful future and instead we went into a command and control into a cycle of allowing the things that think a we are able to control our situation and preserve our station and expand our domination and to manage people and the planet and the colonies and to do all of this in a way where we start having the science of productivity and the science of the polity and political science and we have this illusion of being able to get what we want without ever opening the eyes within us that can know what we actually want, and with only one eye, we can only see what we think we want, our needs, our fears, our expectations, and we try to address those, but it's it's a bottomless pit because the only thing that can really fill those is the eye that is able to see our true desires for love, beauty, connection, and the things that are truly satisfying.  And so what happens as we fall into lust or we fall into gluttony, or we fall into laziness, and we build escalators, and then when our bodies start falling apart, we go to the gym. And so understanding that dohamine is this reward molecule, I think is really important to see why we always imagine heaven as to morrow and that promise that things will be better, I think, kept people in a cage of anticipation and patience. of gritting our teeth kind of patience, but then, as we see in to day's world, we see that our uncontrolled, desire for control has expanded our unbeautiful ways of being into manipulating more of the world into ugliness into factories that fall on the people working to make our clothes and into promoting consumption just to be able to maintain the systems into this problematic situation that we find ourselves in that I think really is exemplified by this disconnect between this faculty that knows what is actually good and beautiful rather than the faculty that sees and wants for oneself, it's the faculty that sees and in that seeing can be satisfied in the connection and relating and and then we can talk very plainly about the rise of suicide. uh being one of the leading causes of death for young people, the beginning of suicides in preteens, which is unthinkable and it is kind of vague sense of anxiety they say that in the last 30 years the levels of anxiety have skyrocketed around the world, and we're coming to a place where I think we have to open that other eye. And I think so many people know this and part of the taste of it was during the pandemic when people uh were unable to go to the work that they were distracted by they started making sour dough, right?  connecting to the arts and to the crafts and to sharing, like you don't make a whole loaf of sourdough and eat it by yourself, and you don't even make the sourdough by yourself, you make it in collaboration with the yeast, and you wait and there's this recognition of a beauty in working with systems, working within and for systems, and they might think of it as a silly example, but as more people looked into their own lives and asked like, I'm at home and I'm with myself. What what should we do? You know people read books.  Maybe for the first time in a long time. and began to touch the parts of themselves that, you know, like when you really immersed in a book, you have a sense of it. It's not the facts of the text and the page that you're reading adding up to a narrative that you have in your mind and some kind of system of social relations that maps on to how you connect with faces and people and no, there's like there there there is a way we need to point at this reality that there's parts of us that know that I believe have been gas lit and undermined and doubted because it's not convenient. just like I couldn't say I love you to a person I loved because it would damage my relationship with my family, my self identity as a Muslim who didn't really know his religion or tradition. I think we all are unable to realize that it's way better to be that bird than to go out until eat the worm in awe and in wonder and defeat our family and to love, and to be alive, then to have complete and utter control, you know, Elon Musk and some of these transhumanists are trying to plug computers into our brains and give us, you know, cognitive capacities that far surpass what we're able to and we have to go to Mars and colonize because we want to preserve consciousness.  And these may not be the worst ideas, but we have to ask like, what's the Tological conclusion, you know? this idea of ad Astura to the stars, right, is highly motivating for many thoughtful, philosophical, wealthy, intelligent, computer science majors who have went into silicon Valley and made money somehow, like this idea of the beauty and discovery, although the beauty of nature and looking at the heavens is also connected to this realization of the grandeur of it that felt sense of oh my God, this is incredible and I get to be here and witness and the humility of seeing signs everywhere, you know, verses the kind of logical conclusion we get from how people are trying to cure death. and live forever, leading to this realization that if they had their way, what would be better then dividing the entire universe into matter that will produce energy for the conscious machines and machines that experience the ultimate pleasure constantly, you know, in the world of the effective altruists, they are talking about these things. They're talking about like, is this the most beautiful future we can imagine, which is ultra hedonistic consciousness that has colonized the entire universe and and then what, right?  and the idea of what is beautiful in every moment has infinite faces and your response in every moment can respond in a beautiful way of of infinite path gives you the infinity that we seek and the participation in a chorus and a choir in the moment right now. and sure we might have to protect ourselves if an asteroid is coming and gonna wipe out humanity, having Mars be a planet for us could be an interesting thing as an ultimate backup, but if you look at it, you know wires doesn't have a magnetic field, it would have to have a colony that is encapsulated and food grown in greenhouses and importing much from the earth. And sure it may be over time generations and generations or talking thousands of years since we live forever, it can become a habitable planet through our innovation and our our work, but I also think there is something important about knowing what the right thing to do is and the dangers. Those dangers, the vast majority of the existential dangers that Elon Musk is talking about are because we can't live together in peace on earth, and that comes about because of this lack of recognition, of a foundational faculty and perception that knows the whole that has access to seeing the end state of the entire complex system that they're trying to model and can inform us what is a beautiful way of being through residence, through self-reflection, through self understanding, and this perception directs our attention.  We can think of it like we're wr rung like a bell, and then we can hear what color or what sound we are, right? We don't know that we're a bell in the key of c or that we're a marimba and the key of sea or something. but that perception that we have that is connected to all people's perceptions of beauty and our perception of beauty and truth and love and goodness, that thing is able to inform our actions with humility rather than arrogance. All of our complex systems are false.  They measure tiny fraction of the reality, but we have access to the thing that tells us the now good thing if we can remove some of our biases and our pensions for self preservation, and if we do these things, we don't need to go to Mars. immediately sure our son will explode so we have to have options and sure that knowledge of what the universe is like will continue to evolve and, you know, the asteroid might be coming and I hope we detect it. I don't want to have this moment of looking up and feeling like I didn't live, you know, and if we look up and we're on the process of building our Mars colony, but the rockets haven't launched yet. Imagine the ultimate regret, the pain and the suffering, the infinite moment of agony if the rockets start falling, someone accidentally pushed the red button. and the opposite, imagine if you were trying your best to listen to the one thing that knows everything that also tells you how you can best use your gifts, your pensions, your natural inclinations, your place in the world, the relationships you have. to act in harmony with that, and if more people did this and connected with that part of us, if I didn't say please define love so that I can make sure that on Mars we have a checklist of loving people if I said, I feel deeply that I love you and I'm scared and I don't know what to do about it.  We could have had a very different conversation life would have been very different, but because I had that experience, I have a lesson. and I have a story and thankfully I have a turnaround because in 2004, I met the person whom I love today. And when I met her, the relationship didn't make sense. She was from a different part of the world.  She spoke a different language. We didn't resonate and play off of each other's creativity. wasn't a strong, you know, desire for intimacy was different. But I decided finally, for once in my life, I'm not going to think my way into a relationship and say, what will my parents think?  Does this make sense, according to the religion I was given? That was supposed to tell me who God was and how we want to live, and instead trust the thing that religions try to connect you with that part of us that can know truth. and when I met my wife and I held her, my shoulders dropped, I felt connected to my body and to her and there was a leaning towards there was a yes. And this is very early in our relationship. and so somehow I also kind of believe there's a non-emporal nature to that viewing, that complex system isn't just telling the story of the now that complex system that oneness is everything and every time and telling you now how to be a part of the beautiful story that wants to happen, and it's possible to listen to that.  And it requires only to trust small experiments towards becoming beautiful, and to think through logically and understand who we actually want to be. What are the worldviews that we've taken on? What are the schemas, the frameworks?  What do you think your feelings are? What do they imply? What do they mean?  Are they random? Why is it impossible to be satisfied? with so many options on Amazon and deliveroo and tinder What's happening?  What is good? I gave a talk once called good as hard. and it was about two people who chose two ways of being for two very different reasons. One chose it out of love love for their patience and developed the lobotomy, something that we now look back at and realize its tragedy, but in his time, his love defined its use case.  It was only for the most severe cases when nothing else would work, and it was only to protect themselves from themselves and their families. and it worked. The challenges people monopolized this procedure because they found a hack to do it faster and simpler and make it more efficient, and rather than risking life and having to make an incision in the skull and realize the immensity of that decision, they were able to use a thin metal stick and to use the tear duct behind the uh, right on top of the eye and to break the thin bone very easily at the back of the a bit lobe and and to conduct a lobotomy and the reasoning wasn't how best to help our patients was it let it became how can we do as many of these as possible for financial gain? and then people came back from world War II, injured and traumatized, and this rational way of thinking, this efficiency oriented way of thinking led to many more lobotomies being made than were needed, and Fritzaber, who out of fear and a desire for the longing and acceptance in a German state as a Jewish scientist decided he must solve the problem of the lack of fertilizers which were being blockaded from South America for the bombs that Germany wanted to make to kill, to conquer, to expand, to control.  And so in order to feel and to connect and to be a part of that society as someone who is at risk in that society as a Jewish person, he found a way to be useful to a death machine by creating the nitrogen fixing process. His nitrogen fixing process came from and an optimization of death. How can we make bombs out thinner?  And this technology became what fed our planet because we were able to create massively bulked produce around the world because we had nitrogen-based fertilizers that were easy to manufacture and produce, and so he wanted over a price and so did at germonitz, the inventor the lobotomy. Both of these people on stage receiving the novel Prius, must have felt differently. It must have been confusing, I imagine, for Fritzaber after the war, having his technology been used for other more humane purposes, but there seems to be something about this efficiency mindset, this orientation for something from nothing that requires nothing of us to be to extract out of thin air rather than to participate in the systems of guano and animals and digging in the dirt and people involvements and all of that rather than this mechanized world that turns air into little white pellets, and we see now that those nitrogen fertilizers are being overused are food is less nutritious the water in the Mississippi takes all that run off from the farms and creates a giant dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing can live. and initially, when I first gave this talk, I was still confused.  I didn't realize that good is hard, meant that it's possible too, know what is good, but you have to stay connected to the part of you that sees, and so innovate, invent the lobotomy, but for all of us that want to apply it, we have to apply it with that connection to both efficiency, rationality, optimization, protection, systems, and the part that knows goodness and beauty. And that part that knows goodness and beauty is a step back and it requires us to step back, requires us to look at the looking and to see what we're doing and to ask, and we know these things. I think in communities where we are mirrors to each other and this is why I've been working on this process that I call come alive because our lives depend on it.  I work in social entrepreneurship and social change and impact, and I realize the challenge that we have of instrumentalizing people, we have a perverse intent incentive sometimes when you see that we need problems to exist for our businesses to exist, so do we really want to solve it. rather than the business existing taking second priority to doing something that helps us come alive and give and just like that rope is real, just like the bird leaves and trusts and knows that like we live in a beautiful planet and we know it, you know. As long as we accept that we're a part of this amazing place in these systems, as long as we stay within these systems of nurturing life and give back to them as much as we take in a sense like staying beautiful, I think there is a way into safety and into old age and in whatever is beyond, just like the bird, the good the bird does for the trees that it eats its seeds is it spreads its seeds and its poop and so sometimes when we are deeply integrated in loving ways with each other and the systems that provide life, and we are coming alive even our accidental byproducts can be sources of life. And when we reduce our need for systems and for savings accounts and retirement funds, I really believe that life supports that which supports life. and getting into these ways of being in harmony and perceiving and pursuing that which is beautiful meaningful and true connecting our eye of rationality, where our eyes of intentional submission to the good, I think we're gonna be okay. that we will be able to change in this dynamic ever changing time because that is the nature of aliveness. the fear of the future, the rate of change, is a problem for Stasis, not of a liveness.  It doesn't matter if we get holographic lenses and, you know, telepresence at some point It's going to be okay. We will know how to live then because we will be able to know the thing that is timeless within us that brings the new way of being now that we're being wr rung again that my bell is in the key of C, and this is what it looks like here, echoing off of the auditorium malls. And so I think it sounds crazy.  I think I tried to do a good job explaining my personal experience. The philosophical rigor behind it, the logical sense that it makes the historical disconnect from Descartes and Galileo, and the consequences of materialism leading to the accruel of more material to capitalism, to neolioliberalism, and the consequences of these mindsets. stemming from a hyper focus of a single part of our rational and perceptual faculties, and that all the other forms of currency that are possible and wealth that are possible, and a fourth dimension in time, along with the other three, that expands because we have access to an infinite unfolding that is clear and is evoked in everyone's life at some point if they ask for their sources of meaning, like tell me about a meaningful moment what was happening. What were you attending to?  And in doing that we can clarify one of the ways that the infinite goodness and beauty wants to enter into this world into time through you and if we do that, and we tell these stories, I think we can be our own role model and the role model for each other. We can uplift through not self sacrifice and do well and do good or whatever. It's just do good and do well, you know?  We have to flip it. do well and trust that we will do good and that good might not look like the same million dollar bank account retirement fund where you can escape climate collapse, living in New Zealand that good might be dealing with climate collapse knee deepened the flooding waters, bailing people out of their homes and planting gardens on rooftops. That could be your good. That could be your safety.  That could be a life that you love not a life that is safe and protected. And these ways of talking about values and these ways of thinking are derived from my interpretation of Sufi metaphysics and Islamic philosophy, from Joe Edelman's work on attentional policies and sources of meaning derived also inspired by Charles Taylor and my interaction in silicon Valley and growing concern and feeling of distance from the ways I used to think and I was, you know, at some point wanting to create good with technology and it wasn't working. And then I thought, okay, well, social enterprise and it's not working.  Um, what's good, you know, and I wasn't feeling good and we were rushing and racing and I really believe that we cannot create good until we are good ourselves and a part of that is letting some of our fears go, our desire for self-p protection and trusting more and that we will get the things that we want. when we direct our soldiers ourselves towards the things that we want to give now, we see how the beauty wants to unfold in our lives, how goodness wants to unfold and that it's not about sacrificing our life to create a fair trade coffee company and make less money, but be good for the planet or being good. It's not about being good by our actions and our decisions. It's about letting goodness be us, letting the goodness flow, and we know that through inspirational stories and even stories in our own lives and can we really trust that this will lead us to being just the right thing at just the right time?  I've always been inspired by the quote, don't ask what the world needs, ask. what makes you come alive because the world needs more people that have come alive and that's from Howard Thurman, one of the Christian theologians that have inspired. Martin Luther King Jr. and I believe that and I didn't know why it was true until I said deeply reflecting on it and realizing that this coming alive is related to humility and that humility is also related to learning, and that all of this is connected through one of these models that you can think of similar to the flow state. There is, you know, complexity of task and skill as axes and there's like this Goldilock zone in the metal where it's just out of reach for you, right?  And this idea that we can place ourselves in over our heads and places where we don't have the skills competencies, networks, relationships, understanding, because we think it's good and create a mess and waste investors, money and waste our life and our time versus who am I and what is the most beautiful thing that I am connected to, that I see, that wants to flow through me. am I that person that, you know, has aension for medicine and studied and and loves it and and it comes easily to me and I strive and I'm at that growth edge constantly, but also knowing that there's so much more to learn and and then maybe, if you were in the fifties, you might be the right person. if you felt care and concern for your patience to give somebody a lobotomy if they had to have one, maybe that's the most beautiful thing you could have done then. But then now, as we think about our actions and trying to find product market fit or what the world needs, or look at the SDGs because smart people at the UN design this system rationally and they have indicators and measures for everything, but everyone becomes a means to an end, even if that end is to have a thriving productive business that solves one of the challenges of the SDGs, it is using people's misery or the planet's suffering for the preservation of a system that can address it, and part of that system is the preservation of your life and its financial needs within the system versus integrating into that moment an I see it as like a bottom up and a top down. It's not that I don't like SDGs, but I think we should count SDGs after the fact.  We should be encouraging people uplifting them, asking them what they need to learn with skills, what do they see, how do they want to respond, letting the world be the classroom so that they find their growth edge and how they're going to be participating in all times and let them develop this care and this love and this aesthetic sense, and let them connect to the arts and let them know what beauty feels like and let them connect to wonder and their let's not destroy their sense of curiosity and experimentation and expansion, and let that contrast with the trip to the landfill or to the Ganges river and and let them see what rings inside of them then, you know explore tell the world your story, the story of yourself have authentic action. I remember when I was younger I was working in Iraq and suddenly there was interest from international NGO's to fund women in tech businesses, and they popped up everywhere. And I'm wondering to today how many of them remained you know, they can evolve, they might evolve, they should evolve because the nature is a constant unflow unfolding of infinity into reality when you're connected to that place where beauty comes, and you can't stand still.  You will fall behind. You must be open daily, and it's a practice daily to unfold your wings to come down and to look, and to see what new blessings are brought and to feel grateful you know, we are talking about, you know, gratitude practices, practices, but a gratitude practice is sometimes not going to be able to touch people because there is also the practice of stability, safety and protection and I deserve this, which is the complete opposite of ingratitude. It's this expectation, it's this entitlement and entitlement comes with the same mind that says, I did rather than I saw and I responded, and this shift so important because we cannot see and respond if we don't have that faculty which we do, and I think with my process of just asking people to look at their to do lists and to find the tensions within it because I believe that we are always seeing there.  And so all the things that we're doing are either aligned with that or not, some of them will bring us to life and bring us joy, and some of us won't. Some of those things that are to do that we do because we have to, and we're not questioning, but with a little bit of insight, some questioning, looking at the why behind the things, we can see which part of us we're emphasizing and until their imbalance our way of seeing the world quantitatively a way of seeing the world of entitlement to life only if and when we have clearly created value that is described through dollars otherwise irrit charity case, and there is shame and guilt involved in here until we change that by balancing that way of seeing of doing, of acting, of with the way of receiving, I realizing now that all of what I'm saying is very Taoist sounding, but even just a little bit of Taoism. you have all that yang just put that dot of yin in there, you know, and see what happens and then maybe slowly you can dive into that and come out the other side in a world of yen and then be able to shrink back when it's time for prioritization, and I think Barbara Frederickson and her work on Broden and build can be another scientifically backed way of both philosophically and scientifically understanding how pursuing these expansive states makes it possible for you to be more yourself in the right place at the right time doing the right thing and be supported and get all the things that you wanted in a way where you can receive them. I think this problem with receiving is also a problem with how we're trying to get our needs meant.  And so here I am in France, having been unable to accept the love that wants to flow through me and now I have a baby. and I'm here with my wife and that inkling of maybe this is the person has become more and more true as our love has grown more and more deep, because we are looking together towards that which invites beauty into our lives, and this openness to a meaningful life, a deeper conversation, and uh lots of forgiveness has been a blessing and what I'm working towards in my life is for success to be every step. This little framework might rhyme with the act, therapy framework, and another frameworks, but I hope the story and this way of thinking is convincing and I'm curious if there's any critiques or ways of seeing that I am missing that can either improve it or change it or show me another way that I would find beautiful. So I hope you're having a beautiful day.  And that you're opening up day by day to that which makes you come alive.]]]",

      "content": "**A Narrative Essay: Beauty, Truth, and Living a Good Life**\n\n---\n\n### Introduction \nOkay, so we're going to be writing an essay with our voice because one of my skills and competencies, and something that I pride myself in, is my ability to follow a thread clearly and coherently and articulate it. This content must be mine and come from my heart and not be external. It must be connected to all realities. It's my intention that this becomes a snapshot of my thinking about the truths that I've discovered in my life, the realities they imply towards a good life, and how that impacts the sense of speed, rush, fear, otherness, alienation, and impending disaster with the climate, the wars, the mistrust of our neighbors, and the lack of time and space and knowledge of what to do with ourselves.\n\nI'm indebted to my mom, who shared with me in October of 2011 their Aid prayer from Mecca, and in that prayer there was a talk. In that talk, the speaker shared the idea that God is beautiful, and He loves that which is beautiful. \n\n---\n\n### A Key Turning Point (October 2011)\nAt that time, I was very hurt and unable to accept all of the tradition that I had been raised with because it was getting in the way of me trusting my heart. There was a tension in the reality that this person I respected and admired—someone my heart honestly could lean towards and who brought me aliveness—was fighting with the textual reality of the lack of an articulated Islam or Christianity that I could check off in an accounting system with God and with my family, to say that this woman is a Muslim and therefore I am allowed to have these feelings, rather than the fear, hope, trepidation, openness, wonder, anticipation, heart-opening, heart-racing, mind-spinning possibility of accepting love.\n\n---\n\n### Facing Fear and Confusion \nI remember laying down on the ground outside, and she asked me, “Do you love me?” Rather than taking a moment to take a deep breath, to look inside of my heart, and to say the truth of what I found, I deflected. I asked for literalism. I asked, “How do you define love?”\n\nThere are places within us that know love, that can distinguish love from lust. In my confusion and desire to be confused—to avoid the pain and the stress and the fear of confronting my family and confronting the check-box God and religion that I had invented (that wasn't the true way of interpreting, or the only way)—I deflected and created confusion in my life. I compounded that confusion for years and years. I allowed myself, in that confusion, to create a shadow and to have the part of me that was alive live in that shadow. I snuck out of the house in the dark to be able to be with the parts of me that were actually alive, and I lived like a zombie, having not slept, because in the day I was living waiting for the night—distant from my heart, distant from the thing that knows the truths of the world and the truths within myself.\n\n---\n\n### Opening the Eye of the Heart\nIn October 2011, I was given one of the keys of a trifecta that allowed me to open my heart and to reconnect, reintegrate with my emotions, with my feelings, with my perception of beauty, with my sense of meaning and sense of self, and ultimately, at long last, the realizations that beauty is the splendor of truth, and beauty is that which draws you into love, and that the perception and recognition of beauty is a part of a faculty that is inextricable from that perception and that reality.\n\nThis faculty within us that sees beauty is the place where we can answer the questions of what is true and the confusions that we might have about what is actually good. How should we live? What is real? My background as someone who loves science and technology and philosophy and rationalizations connects to this desire for control and this lack of engaging with the fear and the reality of the bird that, when it wakes up and opens its eyes and sees its hungry children, leaves its nest in fear and hope, seeking the worms, the seeds, the sustenance, and the awe and wonder and gratitude and aliveness at finding it.\n\n---\n\n### The Balance of Rationality and Trust\nThis way of seeing the world and living in the world requires both eyes: we do have a rational faculty. We can think ahead to plant seeds now, to organize our land, to let land rest after understanding soil depletion so that we can have a better harvest next year. I’ve realized that this love of planning and stability, along with my rejection of the tradition that was brought to me (that was teaching me how to open the eye of the heart), limited me from being able to explore in an open way—and the only way that's real on the tightrope of life—to keep my eyes focused on beauty and to walk without looking down, knowing and not knowing that the next step is going to land and that we’ll be okay and that we’ll make it, because the rope is invisible to the tightrope walker. It’s just sensed, just like the worm is invisible to the bird. \n\nIn the Muslim tradition, we’re given many promises of what happens to those who trust and have God-consciousness—that these are those that are successful. These beliefs, I think, must be taken gradually, step by step. You take one step that proves the rope is there; you leave one morning, you find the worms. But winter comes, things change, the wind blows, and the rope moves ever so slightly.\n\n---\n\n### Societal Stasis and Alienation \nI believe that it’s not that we must avoid planning—planting the seeds and using our mind—but that we need, as a society, to traverse this canyon. We are in a place where our stasis is destructive; our not changing is damaging. The roots of why staying the same is damaging are connected to the roots that have alienated us from this perception of beauty and truth and goodness, and even trusting that this means something—that it's not an emotion only, that it may have states, ways that uplift and inspire us.\n\nYou watch a movie about Nelson Mandela, and you leave uplifted with a sense of possibility and hope, and maybe you think to yourself, “How can I be a little more like that?” The first thing that happened to me after my partner broke up with me—because I could not face the fear of the reality that was beckoning, the reality of “I love this person, and I don't know what to do. I'm young. I don't know my faith. I don't know myself. I don't know what love actually means”—was that love is the splendor of truth, and that beauty and truth and love come together, and that if I wanted to know God and how to live, I have to read all three books: the book of revelation, the book of inner insight (looking within our feelings, our thoughts, even our negative ruminations), and the book of the outer world (the beauty of a river flowing down a mountain and a waterfall, and fish below in a clear pond eating the bugs on the river).\n\n---\n\n### Seeing Beauty and Ugliness in the World\nIf you follow that river as it passes through human civilization on the other side, you look again into the water, and you find ugliness—a weird slimy color, a film on top of the water, potentially dead fish, a bad smell. It repulses you. And why is that the case? How is this also true, and how is that a sign?\n\nThese signs of repulsion could have prevented us from continuing down this path. They would say: the smell of London in the 1800s, the squalor, the tight neighborhoods with sewage flowing down the middle, and Jack the Ripper, and the pollution bellowing into the air, and kids coming home in the morning after working a night shift in a factory, and injuries. I'm sure people knew this wasn't beautiful, yet it helped increase the sense of control because there was a power to it that could be grown—resources accumulating into the hands of the owners, allocating according to their desires and whims, unchecked and unpurified and unheld up against the example of beauty.\n\n---\n\n### The Illusion of Progress and Dopamine’s Promise\nThis alienation from the things that make life meaningful requires us to fill it with hope that the future will be better. “I don't feel so good right now, but I believe in this progress that we're making.” This idea of progress links in deeply with this idea of how the reward system within us works. Our sense of accomplishments and reward, and the molecule dopamine that symbolizes it, is not from achievement. It's not from making a goal and accomplishing it. The reward comes from the expectation of a good. \n\nAs long as we were able to tell ourselves and each other, “This world might not be good today, but tomorrow it will be better, when technology improves, when we're able to extract more from less, when we have to work less,” this claim that we increase productivity and somehow work less and enjoy more is not what has happened at all. We've increased productivity and working hours, and at the same time, we're reducing wages. This confusion about what is good, what we want from life, this sense of mastery—it has been possible for only 200–300 years, and it was made possible from the primary disconnect of people with this core faculty that is able to see, and the practice of ignoring the seeing of beauty.\n\n---\n\n### Transhumanism, Mars, and What We Actually Want\nWe went into a command-and-control cycle of thinking we can manage people and the planet and the colonies, do all of this in a way where we start having the science of productivity, the science of the polity, political science, and we get this illusion of being able to get what we want without ever opening the eyes within us that can know what we actually want. With only one eye, we can only see what we think we want—our needs, our fears, our expectations—and we try to address those. But it's a bottomless pit because the only thing that can really fill those is the eye that is able to see our true desires for love, beauty, connection, and the things that are truly satisfying.\n\nSo, we fall into lust or we fall into gluttony or we fall into laziness, and we build escalators, and then when our bodies start falling apart, we go to the gym. Understanding that dopamine is this reward molecule is really important to see why we always imagine heaven as tomorrow. That promise that things will be better, I think, kept people in a cage of anticipation and “patience” —gritting our teeth kind of patience.\n\nNow, in today’s world, we see that our uncontrolled desire for control has expanded our un-beautiful ways of being into manipulating more of the world into ugliness, into factories that fall on the people working to make our clothes, and into promoting consumption just to be able to maintain the systems. There’s a problematic situation we find ourselves in, exemplified by this disconnect between the faculty that knows what is actually good and beautiful and the faculty that only sees and wants for oneself.\n\nElon Musk and some of these transhumanists are trying to plug computers into our brains and give us cognitive capacities that far surpass what we're able to do. We have to go to Mars and colonize because we want to preserve consciousness. These may not be the worst ideas, but we have to ask: what is the teleological conclusion? \n\n---\n\n### Beauty in Every Moment vs. Endless Expansion\nThe beauty of nature and looking at the heavens is connected to the realization of the grandeur of it: that felt sense of “Oh my God, this is incredible, and I get to be here and witness.” There is humility in seeing signs everywhere, versus the logical conclusion we get from people trying to “cure death” and live forever, leading to the realization that if they had their way, what would be better than dividing the entire universe into matter that will produce energy for conscious machines, and machines that experience the ultimate pleasure constantly? In the world of the effective altruists, they talk about these things. They wonder: Is this the most beautiful future we can imagine—ultra-hedonistic consciousness that has colonized the entire universe, and then what?\n\nThe idea that what is beautiful in every moment has infinite faces, and your response in every moment can respond in a beautiful way, gives you the infinity that we seek. That participation in a chorus, in a choir, in the moment right now. Sure, we might have to protect ourselves if an asteroid is coming to wipe out humanity. Having Mars be a planet for us could be interesting as an ultimate backup, but why can’t we live together in peace on Earth? Most existential dangers that Elon Musk is talking about arise because we can't live together. That comes about because of this lack of recognition of a foundational faculty and perception that knows the whole, that can see the end state of an entire complex system, and can inform us what is a beautiful way of being—through resonance, self-reflection, self-understanding. \n\n---\n\n### A Personal Turnaround: Embracing Love\nI had an experience that taught me the importance of trusting that part of myself. In 2004, I met the person whom I love today. When I met her, the relationship didn't make sense. She was from a different part of the world. She spoke a different language. We didn't resonate and play off of each other's creativity strongly at first. But I decided, finally, for once in my life, I'm not going to think my way into a relationship and say, “What will my parents think? Does this make sense according to the religion I was given?” Instead, I decided to trust the thing that religions try to connect you with—that part of us that can know truth.\n\nWhen I met my wife and I held her, my shoulders dropped. I felt connected to my body and to her, and there was a leaning towards, there was a yes. This is very early in our relationship, and so somehow I also believe there's a non-temporal nature to that viewing—that the complex system isn’t just telling the story of the now. That oneness is everything and every time, and it’s telling you now how to be a part of the beautiful story that wants to happen. It’s possible to listen to that. It requires only that we trust small experiments towards becoming beautiful, and to think through logically and understand who we actually want to be. What are the worldviews we’ve taken on? What are the schemas, the frameworks? What do you think your feelings are, what do they imply, what do they mean? Are they random? Why is it impossible to be satisfied with so many options on Amazon and Deliveroo and Tinder? What’s happening?\n\n---\n\n### “Good Is Hard”: Lobotomy, Fritz Haber, and Misapplied Innovation\nI gave a talk once called “Good is Hard,” and it was about two people who chose two ways of being for two very different reasons. One chose it out of love—love for their patients—and developed the lobotomy, something that we now look back on and realize its tragedy, but in his time, his love defined its use case. It was only for the most severe cases when nothing else would work, to protect people from themselves and their families, and it worked. The challenge is that people then monopolized this procedure because they found a hack to do it faster and simpler, to make it more efficient. Rather than risking life and making an incision in the skull—realizing the immensity of that decision—they were able to use a thin metal stick and go through the tear duct, breaking the thin bone easily, and doing a lobotomy that way. The reasoning wasn't “How best to help our patients?” but “How can we do as many of these as possible for financial gain?”\n\nThen there’s Fritz Haber, who, out of fear and a desire for acceptance in the German state as a Jewish scientist, decided he must solve the problem of the lack of fertilizers blockaded from South America for the bombs Germany wanted to make. In order to feel and to connect and to be part of that society, he found a way to be useful to a death machine by creating the nitrogen-fixing process. That same technology ended up feeding our planet because we could create mass-produced fertilizers. He won a Nobel Prize. Both he and the inventor of the lobotomy stood on stage at different times, recognized for their innovations, but the story is complicated.\n\n---\n\n### Staying Connected to Beauty (and Avoiding the Trap of Control)\nThere seems to be something about this efficiency mindset, this orientation for something-from-nothing, requiring nothing of us but to extract out of thin air, that rather than participating in the systems of guano and animals and digging in the dirt, leads us to illusions of mastery. Now, those nitrogen fertilizers are being overused, our food is less nutritious, the runoff creates giant dead zones in places like the Gulf of Mexico. Initially, I was still confused. I didn't realize that “good is hard” meant that it's possible to know what is good, but you have to stay connected to the part of you that sees. So innovate, invent the lobotomy, but for all of us that want to apply it, we must apply it with connection to both efficiency, rationality, optimization, protection, and also the part that knows goodness and beauty.\n\nI believe in communities where we are mirrors to each other, and this is why I've been working on this process that I call “come alive,” because our lives depend on it. I work in social entrepreneurship and social change and impact, and I realize the challenge: instrumentalizing people. We have perverse incentives sometimes when we see that we need problems to exist for our businesses to exist. So do we really want to solve it?\n\n---\n\n### Coming Alive and Trusting in Life\nJust like the bird that trusts and knows we live on a beautiful planet, we also know it, as long as we accept that we’re part of this amazing place in these systems. As long as we stay within these systems of nurturing life and give back to them as much as we take—staying beautiful—I think there is a way into safety and old age. Even our accidental byproducts can be sources of life when we’re deeply integrated in loving ways with each other and the systems that provide life. \n\nWhen we reduce our need for systems and savings accounts and retirement funds, I really believe that life supports that which supports life. Getting into ways of being in harmony and perceiving and pursuing that which is beautiful, meaningful, and true—connecting our eye of rationality with our eyes of intentional submission to the good—I think we're going to be okay. We will be able to change in this dynamic, ever-changing time because that is the nature of aliveness. The fear of the future and the rate of change is a problem for stasis, not for aliveness.\n\n---\n\n### Trusting the Timeless Within Us\nIt doesn't matter if we get holographic lenses and telepresence at some point. It’s going to be okay. We will know how to live then because we will know the thing that is timeless within us that brings the new way of being, now that we’re being wrung again—that my bell is in the key of C, and this is what it looks like here, echoing off of the auditorium walls.\n\nI know it sounds crazy. I tried to do a good job explaining my personal experience, the philosophical rigor behind it, the logical sense that it makes, the historical disconnect from Descartes and Galileo, and the consequences of materialism leading to the accrual of more material, to capitalism, to neoliberalism, and the consequences of these mindsets stemming from a hyperfocus on a single part of our rational and perceptual faculties. Meanwhile, all the other forms of currency and wealth, and a fourth dimension in time, expand because we have access to an infinite unfolding that is clear and is evoked in everyone’s life at some point if they ask for their sources of meaning—like, “Tell me about a meaningful moment; what was happening? What were you attending to?”\n\n---\n\n### Being Our Own Role Model\nIn doing that, we can clarify one of the ways that the infinite goodness and beauty wants to enter into this world, into time, through you. If we do that, and we tell these stories, I think we can be our own role model and role models for each other. We can uplift—not through self-sacrifice or “do well and do good” in the old sense. We just need to do good and do well in the sense of letting goodness be us, letting goodness flow.\n\nIt might not look like the same million-dollar bank account retirement fund where you can escape climate collapse, living in New Zealand. That good might be dealing with climate collapse, knee-deep in the flooding waters, bailing people out of their homes, planting gardens on rooftops. That could be your good. That could be your safety. That could be a life that you love, not a life that is safe and protected.\n\n---\n\n### Integration of Ideas and Moving Forward\nThese ways of talking about values and thinking are derived from my interpretation of Sufi metaphysics and Islamic philosophy, from Joe Edelman's work on attentional policies and sources of meaning, derived also and inspired by Charles Taylor and my interaction in Silicon Valley—and the growing concern and feeling of distance from the ways I used to think. I was, at some point, wanting to create good with technology, and it wasn't working. Then I thought, “Okay, well, social enterprise,” and it's not working. What's good, you know? I wasn't feeling good; we were rushing and racing. I really believe that we cannot create good until we are good ourselves. Part of that is letting some of our fears go, our desire for self-protection, and trusting more—that we will get the things that we want when we direct our shoulders towards the things that we want to give.\n\nWe can see how beauty wants to unfold in our lives, how goodness wants to unfold, and that it's not about sacrificing our life to create a fair-trade coffee company and make less money but be good for the planet. It's not about being good by our actions and our decisions; it’s about letting goodness be us, letting the goodness flow. We know that through inspirational stories and even stories in our own lives. Can we really trust that this will lead us to being just the right thing at just the right time?\n\nI've always been inspired by the quote, “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, because the world needs more people that have come alive.” That’s from Howard Thurman, one of the Christian theologians who inspired Martin Luther King Jr. I believe that, and I didn't know why it was true until I started deeply reflecting on it and realizing that this coming alive is related to humility, and that humility is also related to learning, and that all of this is connected through one of these models similar to the flow state. \n\n---\n\n### Finding the Goldilocks Zone of Being\nWhen you place yourself in something slightly out of reach—your growth edge—you enter the flow. You don't want to create a mess by going way beyond your capacity, but you also don’t want to do what’s beneath you. Who am I, and what is the most beautiful thing I'm connected to, that I see, that wants to flow through me? \n\nMaybe you’re the person with a penchant for medicine, who studied, who loves it, who strives at that growth edge constantly, also knowing there’s so much more to learn. If you were in the ‘50s, maybe you would have been the right person to carefully do a lobotomy, if absolutely necessary. But for all of us applying any procedure, we must remain connected to the deeper goodness.\n\n---\n\n### Education, SDGs, and Authentic Action\nIt’s not that I don’t like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). But I think we should count SDGs after the fact. We should be encouraging people, uplifting them, asking them what they need to learn, which skills, what they see, how they want to respond—letting the world be the classroom—so that they find their growth edge. \n\nWhen I was younger, I worked in Iraq, and suddenly there was interest from international NGOs to fund women-in-tech businesses, and they popped up everywhere. I wonder how many remained. They can evolve, they might evolve, they should evolve, because nature is a constant unfolding of infinity into reality when you’re connected to that place where beauty comes. You can't stand still. You must be open daily.\n\n---\n\n### Gratitude, Entitlement, and Daily Practice\nA gratitude practice is sometimes not going to be able to touch people if they’re still stuck in the practice of stability, safety, protection, and an “I deserve this” mentality, which is the opposite of gratitude. It’s this expectation, this entitlement. Entitlement comes with the same mind that says, “I did,” rather than, “I saw and I responded.” \n\nWith my process of just asking people to look at their to-do lists and to find the tensions within them—because I believe we are always seeing—I notice that some tasks bring life and joy, and others don’t. Some tasks we do because we have to, without questioning. But if you look at why behind what you do, you can see which part of you you’re emphasizing.\n\n---\n\n### Living in France, Coming Alive, and Concluding Thoughts\nHere I am in France, having been unable to accept the love that wants to flow through me in the past, and now I have a baby. I'm here with my wife, and that inkling of “maybe this is the person” has become more and more true as our love has grown more and more deep, because we are looking together towards that which invites beauty into our lives, with openness to a meaningful life, a deeper conversation, and lots of forgiveness. \n\nWhat I'm working towards is for success to be every step. This framework might rhyme with the ACT therapy framework and other frameworks, but I hope this story and this way of thinking is convincing. I'm curious if there are any critiques or ways of seeing that I’m missing that can either improve it or change it, or show me another way that I would find beautiful.\n\nSo I hope you’re having a beautiful day and that you’re opening up, day by day, to that which makes you come alive.",

The core content, voice, and message remain as true as possible to the original text.\n\n---\n\n## Beauty, Truth, and Living a Good Life\n\n### Introduction\nOne of my skills and competencies, something I pride myself on, is my ability to follow a thread clearly, coherently, and to articulate it. This content must be mine, coming from my heart, and remain connected to all realities. My intention here is to offer a snapshot of the truths I’ve discovered in my life, the realities they imply about living well, and how that affects our sense of speed, rush, fear, otherness, alienation, and impending disaster—whether it’s climate change, wars, mistrust of neighbors, or the lack of time and space and knowledge of what to do with ourselves.\n\nI’m indebted to my mom, who shared with me in October 2011 her Aid prayer from Mecca. In that prayer, the speaker said something that stuck with me: God is beautiful, and He loves that which is beautiful.\n\n---\n\n### A Key Turning Point (October 2011)\nAt that time, I was very hurt and unable to accept the tradition I had been raised with, because it seemed to get in the way of trusting my own heart. I respected and admired someone—a person my heart could lean toward and who brought me a sense of aliveness—but I was torn by a textual, checkbox approach to Islam or Christianity. Instead of simply recognizing my feelings, I felt forced to see if the person met criteria—such as being “Muslim enough” to allow for those emotions—rather than embracing love with all its fear, hope, trepidation, openness, wonder, anticipation, and heart-racing possibility.\n\n---\n\n### Facing Fear and Confusion\nI remember lying on the ground outside, and she asked me: “Do you love me?” Instead of pausing to look inside my heart and answer honestly, I deflected and asked, “How do you define love?” There are places within us that know love, that can distinguish love from lust. But in my confusion, and my desire to avoid pain, stress, and the fear of confronting my family or my own misguided view of God, I created more confusion for myself. I lived with that tension for years, allowing the part of me that was actually alive to remain hidden in the shadows.\n\n---\n\n### Opening the Eye of the Heart\nIn October 2011, I was given one key (of what I call a trifecta) that helped open my heart and reconnect me to my emotions, my sense of beauty, meaning, and self. I finally realized that beauty is the splendor of truth; it draws you into love. Recognizing beauty arises from a faculty within us that is inextricable from both our perception and the reality we perceive.\n\nThis faculty that sees beauty can guide us when we ask what is true and what is good. I love science, technology, philosophy, and rationalizations, but I see how a relentless quest for control can close us off from the simple truth that we are also like the bird that wakes up, sees its hungry children, and leaves the nest in fear and hope—searching for worms, seeds, sustenance, awe, and gratitude.\n\n---\n\n### The Balance of Rationality and Trust\nLiving in the world requires both eyes: one rational and the other that trusts the unseen. We can plan ahead, plant seeds, and organize land. But there is also the tradition that teaches opening the “eye of the heart,” which I resisted for a long time. Like a tightrope walker, you step out without looking down, sensing the rope is there, just as the bird senses there will be worms. \n\nIn the Muslim tradition, we have promises for those who trust and have God-consciousness, but these beliefs come step by step. One step proves the rope is there, then winter comes, winds blow, and everything shifts. \n\nAs a society, we too need to move forward and not stay stagnant. Remaining the same is destructive, but so is living cut off from that deeper faculty of beauty and truth. We have become alienated from its guidance.\n\n---\n\n### Societal Stasis and Alienation\nAfter my partner broke up with me (because I couldn’t face the fear of acknowledging love), I realized something crucial: if I wanted to know God, I had to read three books simultaneously. First, the book of revelation (the messages we inherit through tradition). Second, the book of inner insight (our own thoughts, feelings, and even negative ruminations). Third, the book of the outer world (the natural beauty of mountains, rivers, waterfalls, and living creatures).\n\nFollow a pristine river to where it passes through a human city, and it may turn slimy and foul. That ugliness is a sign, too. People in 1800s London likely knew the conditions of squalor and pollution were terrible, yet it seemed tied to a growing sense of industrial power and control.\n\n---\n\n### The Illusion of Progress and Dopamine’s Promise\nPart of the reason we tolerate ugliness is the belief in an eventual better future. Dopamine is tied to expectation, not the actual achievement. So we trick ourselves into thinking tomorrow will be better—when technology improves or when we extract more with less. Yet, we see modern productivity has gone up, working hours have gone up, wages often go down, and people feel more anxious than ever.\n\nThis disconnect arises from ignoring our faculty that truly knows what is good and from fixating on fulfilling shallow wants and fears. The result is a bottomless pit of desire.\n\n---\n\n### Transhumanism, Mars, and What We Actually Want\nElon Musk and other transhumanists think about plugging computers into our brains or colonizing Mars to preserve consciousness. These ideas might not be entirely bad, but we must ask about the ultimate goal. If we could theoretically convert the universe into constant, ultra-hedonistic pleasure for machine-like beings, would that be truly beautiful?\n\nBeauty in each moment has infinite faces, and our response can be infinitely creative when we are present. That cosmic, humbling sense of “oh my God, this is incredible” keeps us alive and open. If the main existential threat is our inability to live together on Earth in peace, then we should address that faculty in us that can see and guide us toward harmonious living.\n\n---\n\n### Beauty in Every Moment vs. Endless Expansion\nThere is grandeur in nature and in the skies. There is also a drive to cure death and “use” the entire universe as some big resource. But the bird’s approach—trusting life in each new moment—provides a different model. We sense the wholeness of a complex system that can’t be captured by rational formulas alone. \n\n---\n\n### A Personal Turnaround: Embracing Love\nIn 2004, I met the person I love today. We were from different parts of the world, spoke different languages, and our immediate resonance was not about intense shared interests. But I finally decided not to think my way through, not to worry about parental or religious checkboxes, and to trust the part of me that perceives truth directly. \n\nWhen I held her, my shoulders dropped, and I felt connected. There was a “yes.” I believe that insight can be non-temporal, linking you to a bigger reality of past, present, and future. It only demands small experiments of trust—moving toward beauty and asking who we truly want to be. We might question our frameworks, our random illusions, or our dissatisfaction in a world overflowing with options like Amazon, Deliveroo, Tinder. Why is it still impossible to be content?\n\n---\n\n### “Good Is Hard”: Lobotomy, Fritz Haber, and Misapplied Innovation\nI once gave a talk called “Good is Hard,” highlighting two innovators. One loved his patients so much he pioneered the lobotomy—once considered a last resort for severe cases. But others then monetized and scaled it for profit, leading to tragedy.\n\nFritz Haber, seeking acceptance in Germany as a Jewish scientist, helped fix nitrogen from the air—originally so Germany could make bombs. This invention also fed the world by creating cheap fertilizers. Yet overuse has led to polluted waters and dead zones.\n\nIn both cases, the original impulse might have been love or necessity, but efficiency and profit took over. The lesson is that if we innovate with only rational efficiency and ignore our deeper faculty of beauty, we risk causing enormous harm.\n\n---\n\n### Staying Connected to Beauty\nI work in social entrepreneurship and social impact. I see perverse incentives: we need problems to persist for businesses to survive. Just as the bird trusts the system that provides worms, we need to trust that staying integrated—giving back as much as we take—allows life to support us. It’s a way of living in harmony and perceiving and pursuing beauty and meaning through our rational mind and a greater awareness of goodness.\n\n---\n\n### Coming Alive and Trusting in Life\nThis approach can help us adapt in ever-changing times. Fear of the future is more a problem for those clinging to stasis, not those attuned to aliveness. Whether holographic lenses or telepresence arrive, we will know how to live if we stay anchored to what is timeless inside us—like a bell that resonates in its unique key.\n\nI realize it can sound idealistic. But I’ve tried to explain the personal, philosophical, historical, and logical reasons behind it. We’ve seen a hyperfocus on one aspect of perception since Descartes and Galileo, leading to materialism, capitalism, neoliberalism—and ignoring other forms of wealth and meaning. Everyone has moments of meaning if they pause to consider them.\n\n---\n\n### Trusting the Timeless Within Us\nBy asking people about meaningful moments—what they were attending to—we discover how infinite goodness and beauty wants to emerge through us. Telling these stories helps us become our own role models, and role models for each other. We uplift ourselves not through rigid self-sacrifice but by letting goodness flow through us.\n\nThat might not look like a million-dollar retirement plan in a safe corner of the world. It could be dealing with climate collapse, helping neighbors bail out their flooded homes, planting gardens on rooftops—and loving that life because it’s aligned with a deeper sense of meaning.\n\n---\n\n### Integration of Ideas and Moving Forward\nMy perspectives come from Sufi metaphysics and Islamic philosophy, from Joe Edelman’s work on attentional policies, Charles Taylor, and personal experience in Silicon Valley. Once I wanted to create good through technology, then tried social enterprise. But it wasn’t working because I wasn’t feeling good inside. I believe we can’t create good until we are good, which involves letting go of fear and trusting more.\n\n---\n\n### Finding the Goldilocks Zone of Being\nI remember Howard Thurman’s quote: “Don’t ask what the world needs; ask what makes you come alive, because the world needs more people who have come alive.” It resonates with how I think about humility, learning, and staying in that “flow state.” We place ourselves in a setting that challenges us just enough—at our growth edge—rather than trying to do too much or too little.\n\n---\n\n### Education, SDGs, and Authentic Action\nIt’s not that I dislike the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). But maybe we should count them after the fact, once people have discovered their own authentic response to what they see. I’ve witnessed NGOs funding quick-fix projects in Iraq, like “women in tech” enterprises springing up overnight, and I wonder how many lasted. Real life is a continuous unfolding; there is no standing still.\n\n---\n\n### Gratitude, Entitlement, and Daily Practice\nA gratitude practice can help, but not if we remain stuck in entitlement—this idea that “I deserve this.” Entitlement is the opposite of gratitude because it’s rooted in the mind that says, “I did this” rather than “I saw and responded.” If we examine our to-do lists, we can see which items are grounded in deeper truth and which are just habits or obligations we never question.\n\n---\n\n### Living in France, Coming Alive, and Concluding Thoughts\nNow I’m in France, married, and with a baby. I once struggled to accept love, but life brought me here. My wife and I keep looking toward what invites beauty, meaning, and deeper conversations. That’s what I work toward: success in each step. It echoes ACT therapy frameworks and others. My hope is that this story and way of thinking resonates, and if there’s a critique or something I’m missing, I’d love to learn another view that’s also beautiful.\n\nI hope you’re having a beautiful day and opening, day by day, to what makes you come alive.",
