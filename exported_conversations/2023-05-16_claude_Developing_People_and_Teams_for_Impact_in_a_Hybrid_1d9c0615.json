Give them feedback on this proposal: May 2023 Introduction At our company, we understand the importance of a healthy hybrid work culture. We are excited to present a pilot program to support and improve your employees' personal and professional growth, leveraging our extensive experience as a social enterprise accelerator. Since 2015 we have been developing our values-based personal and professional growth methodology for entrepreneurship education, fostering inclusive and impact-driven economies. Through our programs, we've impacted thousands of individuals and over 850 teams, many of which have launched, grown, and mobilized millions in funding. Gallup's validated Q12 engagement survey indicates that only 20% of the world's workers are engaged and since the pandemic in 2020 it has been on the decline resulting in lower performance. We believe in the power of remote/hybrid organizations and that it’s possible to take advantage of going remote/hybrid. Remote work, when leveraged correctly, allows companies to save money, boost employee productivity, and improve retention. Using our tried and tested models and concepts in our methodology, we help individuals and organizations outline a working model for productivity and engagement. We identify and implement coaching solutions to propel learning, organizational effectiveness, and personal and professional development. What We Can Do For Your Company In 2023, offices worldwide struggle to balance rising employee demand for more remote flexibility, less meeting time, and work-life balance with a need to keep employees engaged, productive, and motivated. At our company, we transitioned in 2018 to operating our organization and delivering customer services in fully remote or hybrid environments. Using cutting-edge tools, positive reinforcement strategies, and strengths-based development, we have grown our company to 4 continents and 12 hours of time difference while remaining on the leading edge of business acceleration programs. With this program, you can expect the following: Increased Employee Engagement: The tailored activities and personalized growth plans will help ignite each employee's passion and motivation to contribute meaningfully to the organization. Healthier Remote Work Culture: Our program focuses on creating a supportive remote work environment, addressing remote employees' challenges, and promoting a sense of belonging and connectedness with the team. Enhanced Organizational Performance: With improved engagement levels, your employees will be better equipped to collaborate, innovate, and drive growth, leading to positive impacts on your organization's performance. Assessing Impact To evaluate the impact of our pilot program on remote work engagement and effectiveness, we propose working with your company to assess the following KPIs to monitor progress and ensure our solution aligns with your organization's goals: Remote work capacity: Assessed across the organization. Employee engagement: Assessed by team members Productivity: Assessed during the program we will monitor/report team member accomplishments, streaks, and post-program monitoring of selected KPIs. Program Overview Our pilot program aims to catalyze positive change in your remote work culture and improve overall team health, productivity, and performance. Our program will be tailored to suit the unique needs of your organization, and we have a few options for engaging with our training ranging from light touch to training one of your team members - such as an HR representative or team lead - on our methodology so that it may become a repeatable process ingrained in your organizational culture. In addition, they will receive weekly coaching to successfully implement our combined personal and professional growth method within your organization. Our Method Our methodology helps people and teams identify their shared purpose and build towards enhanced shared success. We use reflective practices, personal and professional development assessments, and a library of activities designed to help your employees thrive at work holistically. We focus on fostering self-awareness and identification of purpose at work, effective communication, collaboration, resilience, and personal growth – all critical skills for modern hybrid word environments\n\nChatGPT\n\n2 / 2\n\nAs a McKinsey consultant, here is my feedback on the proposal and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.

Include case studies and testimonials: Strengthen the proposal by showcasing the success of your program through real-life examples, testimonials, and data. This will help build credibility and trust in your offering.\n    \n\nProposal improvement: \"Through our engagement enhancer program, we've helped companies like \\[Company A\\] and \\[Company B\\] achieve \\[specific results/outcomes\\]. \\[Company A's\\] team members reported a \\[percentage\\] increase in engagement, while \\[Company B\\] experienced a \\[percentage\\] boost in productivity. Here's what a participant from \\[Company A\\] had to say about our program: '\\[Testimonial\\].'\"\n\n3.

(e.g., corporate teams, small businesses, non-profits, etc.)\n    \n6.  How do you customize your program to meet the unique needs of different organizations? Could you give examples of how you have done this in the past?\n    \n7.  Are there any specific elements of the program that have been particularly effective or popular among past participants?\n    \n\nOnce I have this information, I'll be able to incorporate it into the proposal to make it more compelling and persuasive.\n\nWhat specific methodologies, tools, or techniques does your program use that sets it apart from other similar programs? Bloom Company Overview Bloom is a human development organization that runs transformative programs and experiences for young people in the Middle East, North Africa, and around the world. We aim to help youth identify the gaps they need to address in order to thrive, and then support them in addressing those gaps. We do this through social entrepreneurship programs, skills development, and other impact-driven initiatives. Our Track Record Bloom and our affiliated initiatives (through AltCity Impact) have been running skills development, entrepreneurship education, and organizational development programs in Lebanon and the EuroMENA region for over 14 years. We are now running startup and \"accelerate the accelerators\" programs in 9 MENA countries, plus an impact accelerator focused on women-led social enterprises in MENA and Africa. About 5 years ago we shifted to online, hybrid online+offline, and data-driven programs, which enabled us to reach a much larger population while running more personalized and impactful programs. We have been building those methods and tools into the Bloom platform which we use to help us leverage our assessments, our methods, Library of Activities, and data monitoring dashboards to run more impactful programs. We have worked with a wide variety of partners including banks, governments, universities, telcos, the UN, World Bank, international investors, and more. A small sample of our current and former partners is included here: We have run more than 50 sprints & accelerator cycles in the last 8 years, collaborated with partners to run 27 more, and worked with teams & training partners across 10 countries. We love running online & hybrid entrepreneurship & skills development programs that inspire and energize, and we continue to innovate in our programs, tools and approaches to improve impact and build a stronger community of collaborators and participants. We have worked with over 850 teams over the last 8 years in 10 MENA and African countries, with a focus on social enterprises and early-stage startups, through online and offline programs. Our teams have mobilized millions in next-stage funding, won prizes (national, regional, and global), and gained acceptance in top accelerators in MENA and worldwide. We have collaborated with leading local, regional and international partners in the tech, accelerator, corporate, government, INGO, and university sectors. Key impact highlights from a recent impact assessment include the following user-reported metrics: 80% of teams say they grew personally during their time with Bloom 79% of teams say they grew professionally during their time with Bloom 87% of teams recommend Bloom programs to fellow entrepreneurs 96% of our teams were able to maintain (despite economic decline) or increase in size 3 months after joining our program Testamonials: 1 “Every time I mentor someone I learn. Every step is an addition to our knowledge and experience.” AJ (Board Meeting) 2 “It is incredible how we can generate hundreds of solutions in just a little time; we need this community in our daily life.” Mortben 3 “The mindset of sharing: giving and receiving is a striking feature. The culture of we grow together is what I am taking.” Ogechi 4 “The energy and engagement of the other teams to support were incredible; I will surely be missing all this interaction once the sprint is over!” Wonderhub 5 “Entrepreneurship is not just about money, it’s about fulfillment.” Latifa Naziha 6 “Such a great and amazing Bloom Team and Program! Being part of the 2 weeks sprint was a great opportunity for us to learn, share and brainstorm ideas with a great community with bright ideas, which proves once again that we, Lebanese people, will always strive and shine despite all circumstances.” Hadiyati 7 “The ECAT did open up my eyes to a lot of things. For example, although I knew I had these problems when I wrote them down and shared them with the team and heard their feedback, I completely understood that those are things I should be taking seriously and solving ASAP.” Le Joyau d’Olive 8 “To be honest, the diagnostic sessions helped us rearrange our thoughts on developing our organization’s policies and structure. It gave us a better insight on how to reflect a better image of our work.” Mohammad Al-Omari, JORDAN Youth Innovation Forum 9 “I want to thank the bloom community for creating a healthy environment for interaction, growth, and, better yet, failure. I’ve never experienced a BootCamp like this before.” Sara ElKoussa, CancerCom 10 “The progress we did for our startup is very valuable and we will always remember the bloom team as the one who supported us and believed in our mission and vision in our early stages.” Lama Eid, WordWave Target audiences as corporate clients, growing startups, organizations with values aligned teams looking to increase engagement with the rise of remote and hybrid work We customize by taking assessments and curating the program based on the assessment feedback",

      "content": " Here are some critiques and suggestions for further improving the proposal:\n\n1. Strengthen the value proposition. While the proposal articulates Bloom's experience and track record, the unique value proposition is still not entirely clear. I would suggest revising the first paragraph to more explicitly state the key benefits and outcomes clients can expect from the program. For example, \"Bloom's engagement enhancer program leverages our proven methodology to increase employee engagement and productivity by X% within 3 months.\"\n\n2. Highlight methodology and tools. The proposal mentions Bloom's methodology, tools, and library of activities but does not provide much detail. I would suggest dedicating a short section to briefly describe the methodology and key tools/resources in more depth. For example, describe the assessments used, types of activities, coaching approach, etc. This helps demonstrate Bloom's expertise and the substance behind the program.\n\n3. Include pricing information. The proposal lacks any pricing details which clients will certainly want to know before engaging Bloom. I would suggest adding a section on program pricing, including any options at different price points. This could also include information on ROI and potential cost savings for clients.  \n\n4. strengthen case studies. The single case study example is fairly weak. I would suggest revising this section to include 2-3 more detailed case studies highlighting quantifiable impacts and direct quotes/testimonials from clients. Case studies from companies similar to the target audience would be especially persuasive.\n\n5. Consider a sample timeline. Adding a high-level timeline or schedule of activities for the engagement enhancer program may help clients better envision how it would unfold and what they can expect. This visualizes the scope and flow of the program.\n\n6. Highlight credentials and team bios. Providing some background on Bloom's team and credentials helps establish credibility and expertise. Consider adding a section with short bios for key team members, relevant credentials/certifications, and Bloom's company accreditations or awards. \n\n7. Offer options for different needs. The proposal focuses on Bloom's pilot program but clients may have different needs and budgets. Briefly highlighting some alternative options at varying scopes, durations, and price points may appeal to more potential clients. Explain how the options differ and the impacts/outcomes clients can achieve at each level.\n\nOverall this is a solid start, but strengthening the value proposition, providing more program details, including pricing and case study information, and offering different options to meet varying needs would significantly improve the proposal.

      "content": "add this element: **Bloom’s Methodology & Training Approach** \n\nBloom’s methodology supports both: \n\n1.  **Enterprise development support to help projects grow and increase impact,** along with \n    \n2.  **Development of essential personal and team skills that correlate with team/project success.** \n    \n\nWe leverage a mix of empowering self-assessment tools to guide people and teams towards setting priorities, and which help us adapt the program to the preferences of the Expo Live team, plus to the needs of the participating teams. We can leverage the content in Bloom’s Library, while also creating custom content for this program. \n\nBloom’s methods also integrate impact, since startups and SMEs, even social enterprises, frequently don’t have the capacity (or don’t prioritize) impact and ESG in their strategy or business practices. According to a survey by Fujitsu 59% of larger organizations say sustainability is their number-one priority for the next five years, while compared to only 49% of start-ups. Utilizing ESG self assessments we will support early stage teams in following best practices for ESG while creating positive impacts through their organizations. \n\n### Embracing hybrid for the best of both online and offline activities\n\nWhile we love the benefits that physical events have to offer, we are firm believers in the **power of virtual workshops and online events to engage people across a wider geography**, leverage mentors and experts worldwide, and enable greater diversity and participation, especially of critical groups such as women and marginalized communities. \n\nBloom methods and platform were designed to deliver dynamic, fun, participatory programs of the highest quality both online and offline, and both small and large. Bloom encourages and can support programs that reach dozens, hundreds, or more people and teams. \n\nBloom’s Organizational Development Frameworks\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**Organization Capacity** is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission while anticipating and managing future changes and risks. Bloom’s Organization Capacities assessment is derived from methodologies used by international consulting firms, which were then adapted by Bloom for enterprises and accelerators. It helps organizations identify blind spots, giving them a 360-degree perspective on where they stand as an organization and helping them pick the areas of **organization development** which will help them most. Teams can then access materials from Bloom’s Library of Activities to help them address their priority gaps. \n\n**Leveraging Bloom’s Organizational Development Frameworks will help Expo Live teams identify key growth challenges and make progress on addressing them faster, thereby helping them move quicker to grow their organization and their impact.** \n\nBloom’s Individual Development Frameworks\n-----------------------------------------\n\nBloom’s Individual Development Frameworks support growth of the single-most important part of any organization: The people within it. Bloom’s framework focuses on three critical aspects of the people that power every organization: \n\n1.  Universal Skills \n    \n2.  Wellbeing & Engagement\n    \n3.  Character Strengths  \n    \n\n### 1\\. Universal Skills\n\n**Universal Skills** help people regardless of their sector or role within an organization. These represent the training component of the personal development framework. The Universal Skills help our teams develop skills that will support them no matter their personal or professional requirements. \n\n### 2\\. Wellbeing and Engagement\n\nOur **Wellbeing and Engagement** methods leverage best practices from the school of positive psychology and the PERMAH method to help guide people towards human flourishing. \n\nPositivity, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Achievement, and Health are all ends in themselves. \n\nWellbeing and Engagement are key for impact-driven leaders tackling global issues. Our assessment measures flourishing across:\n\n*   Positivity: Growth, contribution, optimism\n    \n*   Engagement: Purpose, relationships, mindfulness\n    \n*   Relationships: Support, trust, empathy\n    \n*   Meaning: Values, impact, mission\n    \n*   Achievement: Goals, skills, progress\n    \n*   Health: Self-care, balance, resilience\n    \n\nRecent research from the University of Nottingham surveying 10,000 university students in 32 countries reveals that climate anxiety is a global problem. The study found that 45 percent of respondents said concerns about the climate crisis were impacting their day-to-day lives and ability to function.\n\n**Including this component in the Expo Live + COP28 programming will help teams and participants ensure that they are supporting their wellbeing, which fuels motivation, creativity, and resilience.** It enables sustained impact. Research shows almost half of students experience climate anxiety affecting their lives. Wellbeing is necessary for individual and collective resilience on global challenges.\n\nBloom's programs build wellbeing and skills to manage stress. By cultivating wellbeing, leaders can navigate difficulties and sustain work over the long term.\n\n### 3\\. Character Strengths\n\n**Our character strengths** can help guide us in developing skills that promote wellbeing and enable strong, sustainable social enterprises. Leveraging our signature strengths makes creating climate impact easier and more fulfilling.\n\nIn Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strength”. It is a strength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people energy when it’s used rather than taking effort. \n\nUsing our Signature Strengths can help us bring energy and promote wellbeing at work. \n\nThe assessment represents an analysis of virtues and values held by people around the world. **Twenty-four Character Strengths** are unequivocally known to be good, and are clustered into seven **virtues**.\n\nOur Trainers, Facilitators, Mentors & Experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBloom’s lead trainers individually have a minimum of **10 years of experience training and supporting innovation and entrepreneurship across the MENA region**. Our team also has substantial prior experience in entrepreneurship, tech, education, and community building in the US and Europe. \n\nWe will leverage our network of trainers and mentors for the Expo Live + COP28 programs, while also engaging the Expo Live community, and tailoring the support network to the needs of this program, and the needs of the participating teams. \n\nWe engage mentors, experts & fellows worldwide to provide targeted support to our enterprises and programs in 4 primary domains: \n\n1.  Sector experts adapted to program and team needs; \n    \n2.  Technical experts (big data, IoS/hardware, digital media/comms, etc); \n    \n3.  Enterprise / organizational growth experts (for HR, design/UX/UI, revenue models, marketing, etc); and \n    \n4.  Personal growth & universal skills development. \n    \n\nTeams often work with multiple mentors, experts and fellows simultaneously, or evolving over time, depending on their needs.\n\nAnd mention we're looking for pilot programs to help us take our experience to the corporate world",

      "content": "Compare and contrast with the following proposal, pick the best parts of each and make a hybrid proposal:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAt Bloom, we champion the value of a robust, hybrid work culture. Our proposed pilot program, backed by our extensive experience as a social enterprise accelerator since 2015, aims to support and enhance your employees' personal and professional growth. Our unique, value-based growth methodology has been instrumental in fostering inclusive and impact-driven economies. To date, we have influenced thousands of individuals and over 850 teams, with many launching, growing, and mobilizing millions in funding.\n\nOur method is underpinned by Gallup's Q12 engagement survey data, which reveals a worrying decline in global workforce engagement since the pandemic. However, we are confident in our approach. We see remote and hybrid work as an opportunity, not a challenge. Our tested models and methods can help outline a productive and engaging work model, identifying and implementing the right coaching solutions to boost learning, organizational effectiveness, and personal and professional development.\n\n**What We Can Do For Your Company**\n\nIn today's business landscape, offices are grappling with striking a balance between remote flexibility, fewer meetings, and work-life balance while keeping employees engaged, productive, and motivated. Bloom made the transition to remote and hybrid work environments back in 2018. Using innovative tools, positive reinforcement strategies, and strengths-based development, we've expanded to 4 continents across 12 time zones, while maintaining our position at the forefront of business acceleration programs.\n\nWith our program, you can anticipate the following:\n\n1.  **Increased Employee Engagement:** Tailored activities and personalized growth plans will ignite each employee's motivation, encouraging them to contribute meaningfully to the organization.\n    \n2.  **Healthier Remote Work Culture:** We focus on creating a supportive remote work environment, tackling remote work challenges and fostering a sense of belonging and connectedness within the team.\n    \n3.  **Enhanced Organizational Performance:** With improved engagement levels, your employees will be better equipped to collaborate, innovate, and drive growth, leading to a positive impact on your organization's performance.\n    \n\n**Assessing Impact**\n\nWe propose assessing the following KPIs to monitor progress and ensure our solution aligns with your organization's goals:\n\n1.  Remote work capacity\n    \n2.  Employee engagement\n    \n3.  Productivity\n    \n\nWe will monitor these during and after the program.\n\n**Program Overview**\n\nOur pilot program is designed to catalyze positive change in your remote work culture, thereby improving team health, productivity, and performance. The program is customized based on assessments feedback to meet the unique needs of your organization. We offer various levels of engagement, including training a representative from your team on our methodology, to create a repeatable process ingrained in your organizational culture.\n\n**Our Method**\n\nOur methodology, backed by our proprietary Bloom platform, helps individuals and teams identify their shared purpose and build towards enhanced shared success. We use reflective practices, personal and professional development assessments, and a library of activities to help your employees thrive holistically. Our focus is on fostering self-awareness, purpose at work, effective communication, collaboration, resilience, and personal growth – all critical skills for modern hybrid work environments.\n\n**Our Track Record**\n\nOver the last 8 years, we have run more than 50 sprints & accelerator cycles, collaborated with partners to run 27 more, and worked with teams & training partners across 10 countries. We have worked with over 850 teams in 10 MENA and African countries. Our teams have mobilized millions in next-stage funding, won prizes, and gained acceptance in top accelerators in MENA and worldwide.\n\n**Testimonials**\n\nWe have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our previous participants. For instance, 96% of our teams were able to maintain or increase in size 3 months after joining our program. Here are some testimonials showcasing the impact of our programs:\n\n1.  \"Every time I mentor someone, I learn. Every step is an addition to our knowledge and experience.\" – AJ (Board Meeting)\n    \n2.  \"It is incredible how we can generate hundreds of solutions in just a little time; we need this community in our daily life.\" – Mortben\n    \n3.  \"The mindset of sharing: giving and receiving is a striking feature. The culture of we grow together is what I am taking.\" – Ogechi\n    \n4.  \"The energy and engagement of the other teams to support were incredible; I will surely be missing all this interaction once the sprint is over!\" – Wonderhub\n    \n5.  \"Entrepreneurship is not just about money, it's about fulfillment.\" – Latifa Naziha\n    \n6.  \"Such a great and amazing Bloom Team and Program!

For example, although I knew I had these problems when I wrote them down and shared them with the team and heard their feedback, I completely understood that those are things I should be taking seriously and solving ASAP.\" – Le Joyau d'Olive\n    \n8.  \"To be honest, the diagnostic sessions helped us rearrange our thoughts on developing our organization's policies and structure. It gave us a better insight into how to reflect a better image of our work.\" – Mohammad Al-Omari, JORDAN Youth Innovation Forum\n    \n9.  \"I want to thank the Bloom community for creating a healthy environment for interaction, growth, and, better yet, failure. I've never experienced a BootCamp like this before.\" – Sara ElKoussa, CancerCom\n    \n10.  \"The progress we did for our startup is very valuable, and we will always remember the Bloom team as the one who supported us and believed in our mission and vision in our early stages.\" – Lama Eid, WordWave\n    \n\n**Target Audience**\n\nOur program is designed for corporate clients, growing startups, and organizations with value-aligned teams looking to increase engagement amid the rise of remote and hybrid work.\n\n**Customization Process**\n\nWe begin by conducting assessments and curating the program based on the feedback received.

We believe in fostering an environment that encourages self-awareness, effective communication, collaboration, resilience, and personal growth – all critical skills for modern hybrid work environments.\n\nTo achieve this, we employ a variety of methodologies, tools, and techniques that have been honed over our years of experience in running transformative programs. These include:\n\n1.  **Reflective practices**: Encouraging individuals to engage in regular self-reflection can lead to increased self-awareness and a better understanding of one's role within a team and the broader organization. This is a key step towards personal growth and improved team dynamics.\n    \n2.  **Personal and Professional Development Assessments**: We utilize a range of assessments to gain a deep understanding of each individual's strengths, areas for improvement, and development needs. This insight informs the creation of personalized growth plans.\n    \n3.  **Library of Activities**: Our extensive library of activities provides a wealth of resources for skill development and personal growth. Activities are tailored to the needs of each team and individual, ensuring that they are relevant and effective.\n    \n4.  **Data Monitoring Dashboards**: We believe in the power of data to drive improvement. Our dashboards provide real-time insights into team member accomplishments and progress, enabling us to adapt our approach and interventions as necessary.\n    \n\n**Implementation and Support**\n\nOur programs are designed to be integrated into your existing workflows with minimal disruption. We offer a range of engagement options, from light touch support to in-depth training for key team members. The latter option empowers your team to take ownership of the program and embed our methodology into your organizational culture.\n\nWe understand that every organization is unique, and we are committed to providing the support you need to make the most of our program. This includes weekly coaching sessions, ensuring your team is equipped to successfully implement our combined personal and professional growth method.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe workplace is evolving, and organizations need to adapt to stay ahead.

Our proposed pilot program, backed by our extensive experience as a social enterprise accelerator since 2015, aims to support and enhance your employees' personal and professional growth. Our unique, value-based growth methodology has been instrumental in fostering inclusive and impact-driven economies. To date, we have influenced thousands of individuals and over 850 teams, with many launching, growing, and mobilizing millions in funding.\n\nOur method is underpinned by Gallup's Q12 engagement survey data, which reveals a worrying decline in global workforce engagement since the pandemic. However, we are confident in our approach. We see remote and hybrid work as an opportunity, not a challenge. Our tested models and methods can help outline a productive and engaging work model, identifying and implementing the right coaching solutions to boost learning, organizational effectiveness, and personal and professional development.\n\n**What We Can Do For Your Company**\n\nIn today's business landscape, offices are grappling with striking a balance between remote flexibility, fewer meetings, and work-life balance while keeping employees engaged, productive, and motivated. Bloom made the transition to remote and hybrid work environments back in 2018.

At Bloom, we transitioned in 2018 to operating our organization and delivering customer services in fully remote or hybrid environments. Using cutting-edge tools, positive reinforcement strategies, and strengths-based development, we have grown our company to 4 continents and 12 hours of time difference while remaining on the leading edge of business acceleration programs in the MENA region. With this program, you can expect the following: Increased Employee Engagement: The tailored activities and personalized growth plans will help ignite each employee's passion and motivation to contribute meaningfully to the organization. Healthier Remote Work Culture: Our program focuses on creating a supportive remote work environment, addressing remote employees' challenges, and promoting a sense of belonging and connectedness with the team. Enhanced Organizational Performance: With improved engagement levels, your employees will be better equipped to collaborate, innovate, and drive growth, leading to positive impacts on Wise Systems' performance. Assessing Impact To evaluate the impact of our pilot program on remote work engagement and effectiveness, we propose working with Wise Systems to assess the following KPIs to monitor progress and ensure our solution aligns with your organization's goals: Remote work capacity: Assessed across the organization. Employee engagement: Assessed by team members Productivity: Assessed during the program we will monitor/report team member accomplishments, streaks, and post-program monitoring of selected KPIs. “Disengaged employees cost the world $7.8 trillion a year in lost productivity.” -State of the Global Workplace: 2022 Report Program Overview Bloom PM's pilot program aims to catalyze positive change in your remote work culture and improve overall team health, productivity, and performance. Our program will be tailored to suit the unique needs of Wise Systems, and we have a few options for engaging with our training ranging from light touch to training one of your team members - such as an HR representative or team lead - on our methodology so that it may become a repeatable process ingrained in your organizational culture. In addition, they will receive weekly coaching to successfully implement our combined personal and professional growth method within your organization. The Bloom Method Our methodology helps people and teams identify their shared purpose and build towards enhanced shared success. We use reflective practices, personal and professional development assessments, and a library of activities designed to help your employees thrive at work holistically. We focus on fostering self-awareness and identification of purpose at work, effective communication, collaboration, resilience, and personal growth – all critical skills for modern hybrid word environments. These tools, including recent integrations with AI, will allow your trained team member to facilitate and support your employees' ongoing growth and development. Three key principles of a successful Bloom program are: Our values and strengths power our performance: We help participants identify their sources of meaning at work that unlocks energy and capacity for committed learning and development in their “missions.” Action-based learning loops: Participants are guided to design a “mission” every two weeks. A mission is a performance objective they want to achieve each cycle, including reflecting on past learnings and planning next best steps. Learning by doing together: Promote collaboration and mutual support, especially online, since usually two heads are better than one. “\\[Taking the assessments\\] did open up my eyes to a lot of things.
