      "content": "I am not a tax professional, but I can try to provide some general information. If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien living outside the United States for more than 330 days a year, you may qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) under the \"physical presence test.\" This means you might be able to exclude a certain amount of your foreign earned income from U.S. federal income tax. For tax year 2021, the maximum exclusion was $108,700 per person, but this amount is subject to change each year due to inflation adjustments.\n\nAdditionally, you may be able to claim the Foreign Housing Exclusion or Deduction if you have housing expenses in your foreign country of residence.\n\nEven if you qualify for these exclusions and deductions, you are still required to file a U.S. federal income tax return if you meet the minimum income filing thresholds. You should also be aware of any tax filing requirements in the country where you reside.\n\nKeep in mind that tax laws and regulations can be complex and subject to change, so it's always best to consult with a tax professional or the IRS for the most accurate and up-to-date information on your specific situation.",

      "content": "I am not a tax professional, but I can try to provide some general information. As a U.S. citizen or resident alien, you are generally subject to U.S. self-employment tax if you have net earnings from self-employment, even if you are living and working overseas. This is because self-employment tax (which funds Social Security and Medicare) is separate from income tax.\n\nThe Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) may help you exclude a portion of your foreign earned income from U.S. federal income tax, but it does not typically apply to self-employment tax.\n\nHowever, if you are living in a country that has a Totalization Agreement with the United States, you may be able to avoid double taxation on your self-employment income. These agreements coordinate the Social Security systems between the two countries and determine which country's system you will be subject to. In some cases, you may only need to pay social security taxes in the foreign country where you are living and working, rather than paying U.S. self-employment tax.\n\nAgain, tax laws can be complex, and it's important to consult with a tax professional or the IRS for guidance specific to your situation.",
