Leveraging the Network Effect, ACSI3 offers high-quality skills training and entrepreneurship education in Arabic, reaching diverse populations in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and the Syrian diaspora. Through a three-phase approach, the program immerses participants in global entrepreneurship communities, builds leadership skills, and encourages the spread of knowledge within their networks. The scalable and cost-effective program holds the potential to drive positive change across the MENA region, ultimately bridging the gap between education and entrepreneurship.\nProgram Narrative\nOverview\nProgram Title: ACSI3: NextGen | الجيل الجاي\nBuilding on learnings from previous cycles of the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation, Bloom proposes a new concept to address the growing need for innovative and empowered leaders in the period leading up to entrepreneurship. ACSI3: NextGen | الجيل الجاي (henceforth ACSI3) is a scalable program for equipping young leaders to galvanize entrepreneurship and business ideation in their local communities.\nThe primary impact of this program is planting the seeds for an educational movement that accomplishes the following:\nOffers high-quality skills training and entrepreneurship education in Arabic.\nImpacts diverse communities in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and the Syrian diaspora.\nImmerses youth from the MENA region in global entrepreneurship communities and topics.\nAchieves a lower cost:beneficiary ratio than previous ACSI cycles - i.e. higher impact per dollar.\nContext:\nNumerous NGOs (such as Bloom) provide education and support for growing enterprises in the MENA region. However, few concentrate on fostering the upcoming generation of entrepreneurs. In Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and the Syrian diaspora, the startling youth unemployment rates necessitate future solutions beyond conventional entrepreneurship acceleration programs, delving into more inclusive and socially innovative approaches.\nTarget beneficiaries:\nThis program’s primary beneficiaries are youth ages 18-25 living in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and the Syrian diaspora. The outreach and selection process will consider diversity and inclusion, prioritizing representation of low-income communities, women, refugees, and individuals with disabilities. \nProgram Outcomes\nOutcome 1: Improved skills and engagement in entrepreneurship for youth in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and the Syrian diaspora.\nEstablish a diverse and inclusive network of creative leaders from Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and the Syrian diaspora, cultivating a spirit of innovation, cooperation, and global involvement. Deliver top-notch skill development and entrepreneurship education in Arabic, empowering young leaders in the MENA region to drive entrepreneurial initiatives and business ideation within their local communities.\nOutcome 2: Enhance access and inclusivity in the MENA entrepreneurship sector.\nHarness the Network Effect to optimize the program’s outreach, impact, and scalability, effectively addressing the increasing demand for resourceful and influential leaders in the region.. Outputs 1-3 play a crucial role in achieving this goal. Output 1, the Social Innovation Leadership Trainings, targets a diverse group of youth from marginalized communities, ensuring that participants with diverse backgrounds have access to essential social innovation and leadership skills. Output 2, the Creativity for Impact Workshops, furthers this inclusivity by engaging a minimum of 240 secondary beneficiaries through the organic networks of Output 1 participants, fostering creative energy and catalyzing social impact at scale. Finally, Output 3, the Leadership Summit, brings together a select group of 10 participants, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and diversity in developing strong, cohesive international cohorts. Together, these outputs contribute to a more equitable and inclusive entrepreneurship sector in the MENA region.\nACSI3 will leverage the Network Effect (see Appendix 1: Theory of Change) to deliver value to over 300 individuals. The program will consist of three primary Outputs on a 10-month timeline. Please open this document’s accompanying Sheet, which will be referenced throughout the proposal: ACSI3 - Asfari + Bloom (Shared)\nOutput 1: Social Innovation Leadership Trainings (3 cycles; 60 participants)\nThe Social Innovation Leadership Training is designed to equip 60 youth from target populations with essential social innovation skills. We will organize three cycles of support for 20 participants each. Every cycle will include:\nA one-month, intensive, 100% virtual training program \nOngoing weekly coworking meetings and virtual support on the Bloom Open Community as participants develop their Creativity for Impact Workshops (Output 2).\nParticipants will engage in a transformative learning experience that inspires them to envision a better future. By focusing on ideation and problem-solving, the program empowers young leaders to engage others effectively in the creative process and drive positive change within their communities.\nWho: 20 youth x 3 cycles (60 total)\nWhat: 1 month of intensive social innovation training (see ‘Output 1 Sample Schedule’ in ACSI3 - Asfari + Bloom (Shared))\nWhen: 3x weekly sessions for 4 weeks (12 sessions total)\nWhere: 100% virtual\nWhy: The most important thing a leader needs is the ability to envision a more beautiful future. By guiding participants through the process of ideation and problem-solving, they will be inspired and well-equipped to engage others in the creative process.\nOutput 2: Creativity for Impact Workshops (48-60 workshops; min. 240 participants)\nThe Creativity for Impact Workshops represent a key component of our innovative ACSI3 program. As part of Output 2, graduates from our Social Innovation Leadership Trainings will host their peer-to-peer workshops, engaging at least 240 participants from diverse backgrounds. Note that the total number of workshops varies based on the graduation rate from Output 1.\nThese workshops aim to unlock creative energy and catalyze social impact at scale. With materials and technical support provided by Bloom, these facilitators will gain valuable practical experience and empower others to join the movement toward creating lasting, positive change in their communities.\nThis output ensures that ACSI3 is participatory and public-facing. It will be incorporated in recruitment materials, Open House events, and throughout Output 1 activities. In this way, we will make it clear to participants that we believe in learning by doing, and that Bloom will help them take that step.. \nWho: Each participant from Output 1 will host a workshop for a minimum of 5 attendees, known as secondary beneficiaries. These attendees will be sourced from the participants' local communities, online networks, and the Bloom community.\nWhat: 90-minute peer-to-peer workshops focusing on Creativity for Impact. The structure and content will be adapted and translated from Bilal Ghalib’s successful Creativity workshop (a recent example involving AI is: Girls in AI - Character Strengths And Design). Bloom will provide workshop preparation and technical support. For Output 1 and 2 participants to be eligible for Output 3, they must submit 5 feedback forms and a screenshot, collected from the secondary beneficiaries.\nWhen: Workshops must be organized and delivered within 2 weeks following the completion of each Output 1 cycle. For example, Cycle 1 ends at the end of August, so participants have the first two weeks of February to conduct their workshops.\nWhere: The workshops will primarily be held virtually, but in-person workshops may be allowed in exceptional cases.\nWhy: The principle that teaching is the best way to learn drives this component of the program. With Bloom's support, Output 1 participants will gain hands-on experience leading workshops, which will be documented and recognized with a shareable certificate (see ‘Incentive Structure’ below)\nOutput 3: Leadership Summit (10 participants)\nThe Leadership Summit is a unique, four-day retreat designed for 10 outstanding participants selected from the initial 60 in Output 1. Set in the beautiful Chouf mountains of Lebanon during the program's final month, the summit focuses on fostering leadership development, entrepreneurship education, and strengthening bonds within the cohort. This immersive experience serves as an incentive for ongoing participation and celebrates the leaders' achievements. By bringing together these inspiring individuals, the summit aims to encourage continued leadership across various fields, such as entrepreneurship, civic engagement, activism, and education, ultimately contributing to a more empowered and engaged community.\nWho: Of the 60 Output 1 participants, 10 will be selected to attend\nWhat: A 4-day leadership retreat, focusing on leadership development, entrepreneurship education, and cohort bonding.\nWhen: March 2024\nWhere: Chouf mountains, Lebanon\nWhy: This celebration of leadership serves multiple purposes. First, it is an application (and ongoing participation) incentive. Second, it strengthens the international cohort’s solidarity. Finally, it will encourage these leaders to continue leading - whether in entrepreneurship, civic engagement, activism, education, or otherwise.\n\n\nIncentive Structure\nThis program differs from ACSI2 and other accelerator programs run by Bloom in previous years in that it does not offer a financial incentive to participants. We believe that the personal and professional development potential alone is enough value to attract participants and keep them engaged, especially given that this program will be in Arabic. Nevertheless, ACSI3 will leverage two other incentives for continued engagement and program success.\nIncentive 1: Competitive opportunity for fully-funded travel to the Leadership Summit\nOutput 3, the Leadership Summit, serves as a strong incentive for continued participation in the ACSI3 program. This four-day leadership retreat, held in the scenic Chouf mountains of Lebanon, offers participants the opportunity to develop their leadership skills, deepen their knowledge of entrepreneurship, and bond with their international cohort. By only inviting a select group of 10 participants from the 60 Output 1 trainees, the Leadership Summit creates a sense of exclusivity and achievement. This incentive encourages participants to remain engaged and committed throughout the program, knowing that their dedication and hard work can lead to further growth, networking, and recognition. Moreover, the summit reinforces the sense of solidarity among the cohort, fostering long-lasting connections and inspiring them to continue leading in various fields such as entrepreneurship, civic engagement, activism, education, and beyond.\nIncentive 2: Proof of Skills Certificates\nIn today's dynamic job market, traditional degrees and certificates may not adequately capture an individual's full range of skills and experiences. Recognizing this challenge, many employers increasingly focus on project portfolios and actual performance when assessing job candidates. Bloom's innovative approach to \"Proof of Skills Certificates\" is designed to incentivize learners, assist job seekers in showcasing their true potential, and provide employers with valuable insights into the skills and capabilities of prospective employees, as well as suggest potential next-stage capacity-building activities for new hires.\nBloom is actively developing these certificates while exploring the most helpful open standards to align learners and employers. The \"Proof of Skills Certificates\" issued by Bloom can include the following: \nA link to a presentation, pitch video, or portfolio item demonstrating actual work completed\nA list of activities undertaken\nA record of the learner's skills development progress\nThird-party assessment reviews (where applicable)\nCapacity-based assessments\nA short list of suggested directions for further skills development. \nThis comprehensive approach ensures that participants are adequately incentivized to continue engaging with the program, while providing future employers with a more accurate and holistic representation of their skills and accomplishments.\nProposed Timeline\nActivity Plan Overview (2023-24)\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nProgram setup / Kickoff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput 1: Social Innovation Leadership Trainings\n\n\nCycle 1\nCycle 2\nCycle 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput 2: Creativity for Impact Workshops\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nOutput 3: Leadership Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

      "content": "add this to the summary:\nMonitoring and Evaluation Plan\nBloom has developed an integrated M&E strategy built directly into our training methodology and online platform. This makes short-term (during project support) and longer-term (after direct project support ends) monitoring more convenient and practical for participants, Program Managers, and Asfari Foundation. The system is standardized, supporting M&E for activities we implement while also supporting enhanced M&E for our partner programs and others in the ecosystem. This system allows us to monitor and adapt the program while it is ongoing, to provide further personalization and improve impact. The assessment approach includes:\nPre-program assessments: Select people into the programs, assign people to the most relevant learning and training path, help people define their learning priorities for their own needs and team, and have baseline data for practical pre-to-post evaluation.\nIn-program assessments: Ongoing brief assessments during program implementation, including monthly review surveys and mid-program board meetings with the program manager and mentor to review progress on the work plan. This helps program managers respond to the evolving needs of the participants and teams and adjust content or training approaches accordingly.\nPost-program impact assessments, surveys, and qualitative interviews: We use a combination of our assessment tools plus qualitative interviews to assess individual and team development post-program, at agreed-upon intervals, to understand program impact and evolving needs of the teams for possible downstream support.\nFor the purposes of ACSI3, the assessment process will cover three main areas, adjusted to program priorities. It is designed to assess and support the program managers, learners, and track growth:\nAssessment Areas\nDescription\nUniversal Skills\nSoft skills development tools and methods across eight essential soft skills that support enterprise and organizational development\nCharacter Strengths\n24 character strengths clustered in 7 core virtues to help teams identify their signature strengths and leverage them to improve their personal and organizational effectiveness. \nWellbeing & Engagement\nInspiration and well-being at work assessed with the PERMAH assessment: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Achievement, Health\n\n\nThe assessments include a combination of globally validated assessment tools and tools developed by AltCity Impact/Bloom to meet the specific needs of the target programs, individuals, enterprises, and the online platform that is in use and continued development. The assessment tools and processes continue to undergo further testing and refinement to improve effectiveness.\nEvaluation: \nBased on our internal and independent external evaluation results, our programs are resulting in many positive outcomes for individuals, enterprises, and our accelerator partners: Increased connectivity, improved knowledge of resources, improved access to information, increased communication of needs, improved motivation to seek assistance and resources, and higher levels of understanding and support. \nWe also develop tailored dashboards to visualize impact and growth across various dimensions, including the sizes of projects, the number of new employees and organizations, and a detailed view of organizational and personal development factors derived from our assessments.\nPlease see the following section for an overview of the KPIs relevant to this proposed program.\n\n\nResults Framework\n\n\nOutput\nIndicator\nTarget\nMetric\n\n\n\n\n1.

      "content": "add this to the summary too:\nRisk Analysis\nBloom recognizes this proposed program has many dependencies and moving parts. We are committed to co-creating with the Asfari Foundation before and during the program to achieve the highest impact for the target populations. Below is a brief list of potential risks to the program and mitigation measures.\nRisk Factor\nMitigation Measures\nLebanese economy collapsing\nThe Asfari Foundation could pay suppliers (non-salary related) directly from the UK. \nInternet disruption and internet blockages\nCommunicate with teams over channels that are still functional, support redundant internet connections, adopt low-bandwidth mechanisms for communication (such as text and recorded audio/video, rather than live audio/video calls), and support participants in installing virtual private network software (VPNs) and other relevant tools. We may consider using Briar (networking software using Bluetooth) if we face issues. We are also looking into text messaging solutions for the community platform if connectivity is an issue.\n\nThose mitigation measures above do not address the situation of a complete internet shutdown, which would require items like satellite internet connections (which are expensive and have legal hurdles). Such things are not currently included in the budget, and Bloom will explore such options and costs and budget revised in case this is needed going forward. \nBanking disruption \nFinding alternative ways to disburse funds to staff and suppliers using digital bank accounts, prepaid visa cards, or credit cards linked to Bloom’s account with caps at the maximum funds. Tools such as Marqeta could be an option.\nRisk of global pandemic (ongoing challenge)\nWe designed this methodology to function in very complex environments, including conflict/post-conflict, natural disasters, economic or political upheaval, and otherwise, including epidemics or pandemics. Bloom already runs high-quality virtual and online programs and can support people even further as others may shift to virtual and online work. \n\nThe aim is to increase community engagement, mental health, public health awareness, and well-being activities to be of more robust support for the participants in the programs, the communities, and the teams Bloom works with ecosystem partners. \nThe business environment in Jordan, Lebanon, or Palestine becomes more constraining to job creation efforts\nFocusing on digital entrepreneurship, platform cooperatives (online cooperative initiatives that engage multiple groups, teams, and individuals/service providers), anti-fragile services (services in demand regardless of economic and other conditions, sometimes counter-cyclical to other sectors), and decentralized technologies and enterprises that can contribute to improved resilience. \nParticipating teams are slow to engage with entrepreneurship, have limited capacity to do so, or have little interest in doing so, resulting in slower skills development and iterations in experimentations.\nBloom works to strengthen and adapt its selection processes, monitoring, and support mechanisms to help ensure that teams are picked that will operate efficiently and effectively. Proper support motivates them to work as efficiently and effectively as possible. \nProgram participants may emigrate\nBloom is working to support various participants and build stronger resilience in the program and communities by supporting a diverse range of people from different geographies and demographics. In addition, teams are trained to become more adept at remote work and running remote teams, in which case the location of some team members has less relevance.\nParticipants have issues traveling to Lebanon (Output 3)\nBloom’s programs team is ready and able to assist participants with the necessary steps to obtain visas and organize travel when necessary. Travel to Lebanon can be difficult, especially for Palestinian citizens. If this becomes an absolute barrier, we may explore options for hosting the Summit in Amman.\n\nBudget Overview\nStaff Sub-total\n£58,117.36\nTraining Costs Sub-total\n£7,166.15\nLeadership Summit Sub-total\n£14,247.99\nIndirect Costs Sub-total\n£20,266.63\nGrand Total\n£99,798.13\n\n\nDetailed Monthly Budget is located in ACSI3 - Asfari + Bloom (Shared)\n\nConclusion\nThank you for reading Bloom’s proposal for ACSI3: NextGen | الجيل الجاي. 🌻 💛\nTo summarize, this program is an innovative model for reaching beyond the typical beneficiaries of social entrepreneurship education in the MENA region. By incorporating Arabic language, diversity and inclusion measures, and secondary beneficiaries, we believe this program has the potential to generate widespread, ongoing impact in the region.\nAppendix 1: Theory of Change\nLeveraging the Network Effect for Social Innovation and Inclusivity\nThe Network Effect, a potent driver of education and social change, thrives on connections and collaborations stemming from diverse, interconnected networks. As individuals and organizations unite, their collective impact amplifies, leading to the rapid spread of ideas, resources, and innovations. In education and social entrepreneurship, the Network Effect fosters resilience, adaptability, and inclusivity, breaking down systemic barriers and unlocking the untapped potential of traditionally marginalized communities. By harnessing this dynamic phenomenon, the MENA impact entrepreneurship sector can nurture a more equitable, empowering, and transformative landscape for future generations.\nACSI3 capitalizes on the Network Effect to address the distinctive challenges and opportunities in the MENA impact entrepreneurship sector. By cultivating a diverse, inclusive, and accessible network, ACSI3 aspires to dismantle traditional barriers to entry and ensure that individuals traditionally underrepresented or excluded from the entrepreneurship space can benefit from the program's resources and opportunities.\nIn the context of the MENA impact entrepreneurship sector, the Network Effect has several essential implications for enhancing access and inclusivity:\nReaching Underserved Communities: ACSI3 leverages the Network Effect to extend its reach and impact to traditionally underserved or marginalized communities in the MENA region, including refugees, women, and individuals from low-income backgrounds. By empowering these groups with essential skills, knowledge, and connections, ACSI3 strives to level the playing field and generate more equitable opportunities for all.\nCultivating Local Talent: The Network Effect enables ACSI3's primary beneficiaries to identify, engage, and develop local talent within the MENA region, equipping individuals with the tools and resources needed to drive social impact and contribute to the regional impact entrepreneurship ecosystem's growth.\nPromoting Gender Equality: By fostering an inclusive network, ACSI3 actively works to advance gender equality within the impact entrepreneurship sector, encouraging the participation and leadership of women and girls. The Network Effect empowers the program to connect female entrepreneurs with mentors, role models, and resources, assisting in breaking down traditional gender barriers and creating a more diverse and inclusive environment.\nExpanding Language Accessibility: By offering high-quality skills training and entrepreneurship education in Arabic, ACSI3 tackles a significant barrier to entry for many individuals in the MENA region. The Network Effect aids in ensuring that language is not an obstacle for aspiring entrepreneurs, making the program more accessible and inclusive.",

A detailed list of KPIs has been outlined to measure the program's success across four main areas: Social Innovation Leadership Trainings, Creativity for Impact Workshops, the Leadership Summit, and enhanced access and inclusivity in the MENA entrepreneurship sector. \n\nPotential risks to the program and corresponding mitigation measures have been identified, including the Lebanese economy collapsing, internet disruption, banking disruption, global pandemic, the challenging business environment in the region, slow engagement with entrepreneurship, participants emigrating, and issues with traveling to Lebanon. The budget overview has a grand total of £99,798.13. ACSI3 aims to harness the Network Effect to reach underserved communities, cultivate local talent, promote gender equality, and expand language accessibility in the MENA impact entrepreneurship sector.",
