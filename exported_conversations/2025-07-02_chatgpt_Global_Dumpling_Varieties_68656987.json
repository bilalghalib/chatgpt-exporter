      "content": "Absolutely! The idea that “every culture has a dumpling” is surprisingly true—there’s something universal about wrapping or shaping dough around a filling (or even just dough on its own) and steaming, boiling, baking, or frying it. Here’s a diverse, long list of dumpling-like foods from many cultures, including Iraq and France:\n\n---\n\n### 🌍 **Dumplings Around the World**\n\n#### 🇮🇶 **Iraq**\n- **Kubba/Kibbeh** — A bulgur wheat or rice dough stuffed with spiced ground meat, often deep-fried or boiled. Variants include:\n  - *Kubba Mosul* – flat and baked\n  - *Kubbat Halab* – torpedo-shaped and fried\n  - *Kubba Hamuth* – served in sour soup\n\n#### 🇫🇷 **France**\n- **Quenelle** — A delicate, oval-shaped dumpling made from creamed fish or meat mixed with breadcrumbs and egg, poached and often served with sauce.\n- **Ravioles du Dauphiné** — Small cheese-filled pasta squares from southeastern France, similar to Italian ravioli.\n\n---\n\n### 🍜 **Asia**\n\n#### 🇨🇳 **China**\n- **Jiaozi** — Crescent-shaped dumplings with meat and/or vegetables, boiled, steamed, or pan-fried.\n- **Xiao Long Bao** — Soup dumplings with hot broth inside.\n- **Wontons** — Usually served in broth or deep-fried.\n\n#### 🇯🇵 **Japan**\n- **Gyoza** — A Japanese take on Chinese jiaozi, typically pan-fried with a crispy bottom.\n- **Shumai** — Open-topped steamed dumplings, often pork or shrimp.\n\n#### 🇰🇷 **Korea**\n- **Mandu** — Filled with meat and vegetables; can be steamed, fried, or served in soups.\n\n#### 🇻🇳 **Vietnam**\n- **Bánh bột lọc** — Clear tapioca dumplings filled with shrimp and pork, steamed in banana leaves.\n\n#### 🇹🇭 **Thailand**\n- **Kanom Jeeb** — Thai-style steamed dumplings inspired by shumai.\n- **Saku Sai Moo** — Tapioca balls filled with minced pork and peanuts, steamed and served with lettuce.\n\n#### 🇮🇳 **India**\n- **Modak** — Sweet dumplings filled with coconut and jaggery, steamed or fried, especially during Ganesh Chaturthi.\n- **Kozhukatta** — South Indian rice dumplings, sweet or savory.\n\n#### 🇳🇵 **Nepal**\n- **Momo** — Hugely popular meat or vegetable dumplings, steamed or fried.\n\n#### 🇹🇯 **Tibet**\n- **Tingmo** — Steamed bread rolls (non-filled).\n- **Momo** — As in Nepal, Tibetan-style dumplings often filled with yak meat.\n\n---\n\n### 🧆 **Middle East & Mediterranean**\n\n#### 🇱🇧 / 🇸🇾 / 🇵🇸\n- **Kibbeh** — As with Iraq, widely loved throughout the Levant.\n- **Shishbarak** — Yogurt soup with tiny meat-filled dumplings (Levantine ravioli).\n\n#### 🇹🇷 **Turkey**\n- **Manti** — Tiny dumplings filled with spiced meat, often served with yogurt and garlic sauce.\n\n#### 🇮🇱\n- **Kreplach** (Ashkenazi Jewish) — Meat-filled dough boiled or fried, served in soup.\n\n---\n\n### 🥟 **Europe**\n\n#### 🇮🇹 **Italy**\n- **Ravioli / Tortellini** — Pasta dumplings with a wide variety of fillings.\n- **Gnocchi** — Potato-based dumplings, sometimes considered pasta-adjacent.\n\n#### 🇩🇪 **Germany**\n- **Maultaschen** — Large ravioli-like dumplings filled with meat, spinach, breadcrumbs.\n\n#### 🇵🇱 **Poland**\n- **Pierogi** — Dumplings with fillings ranging from potato and cheese to berries.\n\n#### 🇷🇺 **Russia**\n- **Pelmeni** — Meat-filled dumplings boiled and often served with sour cream.\n- **Vareniki** — Similar to pierogi, often sweet or vegetarian.\n\n#### 🇭🇺 **Hungary**\n- **Nokedli** — Small, soft dumplings like spaetzle.\n\n#### 🇷🇴 **Romania**\n- **Colțunași** — Similar to pierogi or ravioli, often filled with cheese or meat.\n\n---\n\n### 🌽 **Africa & Americas**\n\n#### 🇲🇦 **Morocco**\n- **Rfissa with msemmen or tride** — While not dumplings per se, small torn crepes in broth can resemble dumpling textures.\n\n#### 🇳🇬 **Nigeria**\n- **Fufu Dumplings** — When shaped into balls and served in soups, fufu can be considered a doughy dumpling-like food.\n\n#### 🇧🇷 **Brazil**\n- **Pastel** — Fried dough with savory filling.\n- **Pamonha** — Corn-based dumpling steamed in corn husk.\n\n#### 🇲🇽 **Mexico**\n- **Tamales** — Corn dough filled with meats or sweets, steamed in banana or corn leaves.\n\n#### 🇨🇴 **Colombia**\n- **Empanadas** — Fried or baked dough pockets with meat or cheese filling.\n\n#### 🇺🇸 **United States (South)**\n- **Chicken and Dumplings** — Biscuit-like dough simmered in a chicken stew.\n\n---\n\n### ❄️ **Arctic and Northern Peoples**\n\n#### 🇨🇦 / Inuit\n- **Akutaq (\"Eskimo Ice Cream\")** — Not a dumpling, but an example of a culturally specific, shaped and mixed food.\n\n---\n\nThis list could be expanded further with regional twists (e.g., Afghan *aushak*, Uzbek *chuchvara*, South African *vetkoek*, etc.), but it already shows how widespread and beloved dumpling-like foods are.\n\nWould you like this in a downloadable table or visual map?",
