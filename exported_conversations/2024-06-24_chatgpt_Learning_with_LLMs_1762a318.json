Text:\n{{{INSPIRE & NAVIGATE\nAligned Pedagogically Sound Frameworks   For Transformational Learning\n\nIntroduction - How to Learn What You Don’t Know Without A Teacher\nLearning how to learn is the fundamental skill of learning. It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, instead of approaching them to produce answers themselves, aided by the tool.  To use LLMs effectively we must understand them deeply, understand learning deeply, and to map between learning needs and the architecture and mechanics LLMs have that open up different affordances. \n\nIntuitively we can do this through a simplified geometric representation of a goal and a knowledge map and some intuitive leaps. We are approaching this practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nWe believe it may be possible to have  a one to one map for the production of data points, which leads to information, which is then refined into knowledge both within the human mind as a learner, as well as within leverageable structures within LLMs. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination.  \nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December after hundreds of hours of GPT use the following framework has been developed. Finding first the principles that led to better results with Large Language Models (LLMs) and then later formalized through the lense of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into transformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how LLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by these two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to migration, economic impoverishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of their understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to develop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nBalaji Srinivasan, author of the Network State, describes “dark talent” - the idea that through networking we can find extreme talant anywhere then support and network them into a powerful State beyond borders. This idea superficially sounds possible, yet upon further consideration good ideas do not come simply from numbers of brains alone. Exposure is critical. While there are many definitions for intelligence, the one that appeals to me most is the one proposed by Douglass Hofsteader in his book Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire as the ability to abstract and generalize from specific instances into concepts that become manipulable in an uninterpreted way. For instance the moment you hear something it’s either a noise or a sound, a sound you can say has an isness - an implication, hooked into an idea, a noise is something that must be interpreted. That immediate translation from auditory input into categorization likely develops like our other senses, and it’s for this reason I propose we may be more likely homo-sensorious than homo-sapiens, since thinking is seeing. The process of taking sensory input, conceptual input and deriving a new “one of those” is a process humanity does individually and collectively. Youth are often at the forefront, as GenZ slang demonstrates copious examples. \nLet’s talk about being “Based” - which originated as a way to describe someone who was “freebasing” drugs, which itself is a created concept based on the idea of acids and bases, transforming amines, usually basic, into their neutral counterparts to alter their consumption methods and impacts. Now, for GenZ, being based simply means “not caring” - and it’s very likely the majority of people using the word have no understanding of the chemical processes underpinning the origin of the word. And most chemists likely do not know that the word, base, comes from the greek pedestal due to it bening the structure upon which an acid rests upon when making a salt (The Origin of the Term “Base” by William B. Jense 10.1021/ed083p1130). \n\nWhy did we take this long detour into understanding the origins of ideas? It’s to make it clear that there is more than superficial language connecting human intelligence with machine intelligence, and that by exposing how a machine learns to a human, we can transfer some of the millions of dollars and effort spent running millions of words across the attention mechanisms of LLMs to the most marginalized learners on the planet. Making it more likely that they could be one of the “dark talents” that will come up with the idea that will deeply and positively impact their communities and our world. The network state should seek true diversity for it to make true on its promise, otherwise we will have a silicon valley state with Berlin, Beijing, Paris, Silicon Valley, New York, Porto, Dubai, Bangalore and other cities like these being over-represented, and not due to their population count. \nTo increase the possible surface area of ideas crossing minds that are able to merge and encompass I believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of pre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of 2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nWhile we’re waiting for openAI and Anthropic to integrate machine-human transfer learning into the core of their offering, we have options:\n\t•\tSupport the development of the ways of being that inspire prompting along the framework described below. \n\t•\tTechnological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of improvements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer. \n\t•\tDeveloping customized system prompts that align with the person that will maneuver the LLM to being more transfer and transformational in its dialog. \n\nThese two ideas:\nTransfer and transformation hint at what I believe to be the key insight underneath much of this argument, that we can learn best when we learn in symbiosis with a machine that learns in similar ways (concept clustering). \nSalience is the sense that things are meaningful and make sense, when you write a poem referring to your infant child as the light of your life, she doesn’t become photons, yet you may sense the rightness of this analogy. When taking certain entheogens one might start reducing their critical thinking allowing them to make analogies that are further off from reality. This lamppost reminds me of my highschool history teacher’s handwriting - perhaps. Yet how helpful is it for them, let alone others? Only God(swt) has the highest analogy, truely being able to see the oneness of everything - to hold that in total comprehension. We are reduced to analogies that are “useful” - yet the true geniuses are those that continue to expand and encompass till they are able to hold more things in the light of oneness. This is the process of meta-cognition. The ability to dive into the uniqueness yet zoom out into the unity at will. This in/out process is what enables the building of patterns across truely related concepts that those inside the concept space might not be able to see. \nThis is how pattern recognition is possible. A developer at a certain level of mental complexity may think their job is to provide code that achieves a goal - contrast this to a CEO making a decision where they may need to be able to see the interrelationships between being a father, a ceo, the company in the context of the economy, the economy in the context of global cultural shifts against capitalism, the international climate and how it relates to a decision between stainless steel and aluminum.\nThis level of thinking is more related to a why than a how. \nMachines are more and more able to take over the how, and normally mental complexity and human transformation that leads to it arises after many years of “one of those”ing many situations, building experience throughout life. Is it possible to develop and transform and grow in the true sorts of comprehension that allow someone to see and know the why behind things, the thing that touches the indeterminate gut intuition, the sense of rightness, the value that one knows through their emotions, the feeling of beauty that arises when the right thing emerges. \nThis is a “zone of genius” - this is everything one knows and an element of the ineffable, what exactly is a beautiful idea? How does one make a decision at high levels of abstraction? I believe that it’s similar to the physicist who chooses the more beautiful equation and finds this “trust” is rewarded. Or as G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” Why?\nWhile one may dive into controversial territory speaking of God or Truth. I believe we can stay within the realm of the philosophical and logical. We see that salience is possible to artificially enhance, that moment when someone on a psychoactive substance senses they just found the meaning of everything and they write it down only later to find it’s something like “the stars are beautiful, and I am a star” or some other phrase that doesn’t quite pack the same punch. This is related to the difference between a two dimensional matrix True and false and permanent and transitory. There are moments in our lives when we are able to go a level above our mental complexity and we glimpse the world from above, like a flatlander in 2 dimensions being pulled into the third dimension and can finally understand the topology of 2 dimensional shapes, that all the differences he sees in triangles and squares and octogons, that really, in a sense that is hard to build when you live in 2, they’re all the same, a single line encompassing a space - all essentially circles. \nTo gain an intuitive understanding of the sort of space of inspiration needed to build new knowledge, let’s study this picture carefully:\nWhat does it look like it represents?  Imagine you produced this image through this process:\n\nTry to determine the structure of the material in the place of the green shape in the image above?\n\n\n Would you have guessed a corkscrew?\n\nWe now know what DNA looks like, I can only imagine the AHA moment Rosalind Franklin had when she made the connection between all the data. I also wonder if she also decided to use the frame of a twisted strand because it was beautiful. If only she was alive today to ask.\n\nThis realization that we find throught science and mathematics, that beauty is a trustworthy guide may have evolutionary origins, although there is no reason that of all the ways the world could have worked that it should be this way.\n\nI believe that a good human life is connected to this source of knowledge, the source where we know beauty and align ourselves and our actions with it. It’s not to become a bootcamp developer or whatever is the current trend in education. The how will be automated, craft remains since craft remains tied to purpose and beauty.\n\nOk, now let’s connect this dialog with learning and transformation using LLMs: \n\n\nNow, we’re sharing it with a series of practical methods to support others in getting better results while developing their deep understanding of what’s special about LLMs and how to get good results. This is how you learn prompting.\n We call this LLM framework and techniques S.C.R.I.B.E.R (Seek, Critique, Reflect, Inquire, Broaden/contract, Explain, Recurse), and we can teach you and your team how to get excellent results from LLMs while building their capacity and identifying their unique contributions. \n\n\nPedagogical Principle\nSCRIBER Element\nLLM Capability\nSystem Prompt\nExample Prompt\nSocial Interaction and Collaboration\nSeek, Critique, Broaden/Contract\nNatural Language Understanding\nEncourage learners to engage in discussions with peers and experts, and prompt the LLM to facilitate collaborative problem-solving.\n\"Identify a challenge related to [Topic] that you'd like to explore with others.
