Here is the conclusions:\n\nالخلاصة\nتُعد معالجة مياه الصرف الصحي بالنظام العمودي العميق مفهوماً مبتكراً، إذ يستخدم نظام عمودي أسطواني عميق بدلاً من الأنظمة السطحية الضحلة التقليدية. تتمثل ميزة النظام العمودي العميق في تقليل المساحة السطحية المطلوبة لمحطة معالجة مياه الصرف الصحي. فضلاً عن، تجميع مجموعة من فعاليات المعالجة بوحدات معالجة أقل، مع تقليل المُعدات المستخدمة والتي بالتالي تقلل التكلفة وتسخر ظاهرة التنقية العميقة الذي يزيد من تراكم المواد الصلبة العالقة (STS) وإزالة المواد العضوية بتحسين ذوبان الأوكسجين (BOD) المطلوب للأحياء المجهرية (البيولوجية). إن التصميم المبتكر سيعالج انبعاثات الغازات والروائح الكريهة الموجودة في محطة تصفية مياه الصرف الصحي التقليدية والتي هي واحدة من المعوقات لبناء مثل تلك المحطات في مناطق سكنية مجاورة، بينما التصميم المبتكر سيكون محدود المساحة ومغلق وبالتالي بالإمكان حصر تلك الغازات ومعالجتها قبل اطلاقها للجو الخارجي.\n\n6.0 Significance of the Project\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project not only addresses contemporary environmental challenges but also resonates with Iraq's historical commitment to environmental legislation. Iraq's early initiatives, like the Regulation No. (25) of 1967, laid the foundation for protecting water resources, a commitment further solidified by joining the UN Water Convention. This project continues that legacy, demonstrating Iraq's dedication to sustainable water management and environmental stewardship.\nNow Iraq stands at a pivotal moment to reassert its leadership in environmental legislation and implementation. The project is a testament to innovation in wastewater treatment and a crucial step in keeping Iraqi citizens healthy and safe. By reducing healthcare costs and protecting water resources, the project aligns with Iraq's legal structures, and its commitment to environmental excellence.\n6.0 Conclusions\nThe vertical treatment plant will be able to treat the effluent (waste water discharge) in the first year after the completion of the first shaft. Slowing the processes of polluting the river and reducing the damage to Dicle(Tigris) without waiting for the completion of the whole project.\nFinally, this report serves as compelling evidence of the feasibility, cost-saving, and land-saving advantages offered by our joint venture team's EPA award-winning and patented vertical shaft Wastewater Treatment Technology Solution.

This decrease has exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site. Notably, contamination from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, significantly impacts the Tigris River. Research by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants like biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater from Medical City, surpassing legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\n3.2. Current Environmental Status\nThe water crisis in Iraq sets a critical backdrop for environmental discussions, as highlighted by H.E. Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference referencing that over the last 40 years water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris have decreased by 30 to 40%. With a marked reduction in river flows pollution concerns at the Medical City site become more and more important to address.\nOf particular significance is the contamination originating from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, and notably impacting the Tigris River.\n\n\nAggregated contaminated water from Medical City is seen exiting into the Tigris River\nSatellite observations of polluted water emanating from Medical City outfall (dark color).\n\nResearch conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain, as documented in papers with reference numbers ISSN: 1735-3866 and ISSN: 2412-0758\n\n(Number ISSN: 1735-3866)\n\n(Number ISSN: 2412-0758)\nIn these papers, it provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater discharged from Medical City. These levels surpass legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\nStudies such as \"Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the Medical City on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq\" by Abdullah M. Ahmed and Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani, and \"Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River\" by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah, and Dr. Mohammed N.

Al-Baidhani https://doi.org/10.22124/cjes.2024.7447\nThe mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a deterioration in water quality.\nReference: “Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River” by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi  https://doi.org/10.30684/etj.34.3B.8\nIn light of global trends and local data, it becomes evident that strategic improvements in wastewater treatment are required. Enhanced treatment methods are essential to not only address the immediate concerns related to Medical City's outfall but also to contribute to the larger objective of mitigating Iraq's water challenges.\n\n3.3 Environmental, Social & Financial Impact\nWastewater mismanagement poses significant environmental, social, and financial threats. By contaminating natural water bodies and reducing arable land, it endangers human health and wildlife while undermining economic activities reliant on clean water. This project's investment in advanced treatment will yield substantial benefits by averting ecological damage and fostering economic prosperity through cleaner water resources.  \nThis process of dumping wastewater into the natural water supply poses hazards not only to human health, but can also have a devastating effect on wildlife, especially for fish and other animals in the water. Harmful substances in water can also get into fields and soil, which results in smaller crop yields for farmers. \nThe damage to ecosystems due to excessive wastewater discharges has impacts beyond the environment. Economic impacts, such as pumping waste water without treatment into Dijlah river, will cause losses to the population since river water is used for drinking and manufacturing activities and river banks normally are invested for recreation, commercial and employment opportunities. \nIn the economic analysis of this investment, the ecological externalities of the project were monetized, starting from the assumption that the wastewater treatment process is a process that has desired output—treated water. Their estimated value, determined by “shadow prices'', actually represents the avoided damage/costs, i.e., the realized benefit/income for the environment as a result of the removal of pollutants during treatment in the WWTP (Wastewater Treatment Plant).\nThe difference between the pollution costs for wastewater and the pollution costs for treated water represents the realized savings in the cost of pollution, i.e., environmental benefits. For example, the suspended particles. The final results of the conducted economic cost-benefit analysis unequivocally indicate the full socio-economic justification for the investment. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis proved that the project is resistant to possible changes in input parameters over time.\n3.4 Legal Status and Compliance\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project is set within a robust legal framework that reflects Iraq's long-standing and evolving commitment to environmental stewardship. This includes adherence to historical legislations like Regulation No. (25) of 1967, which underscores Iraq's early initiatives in preserving its water resources. \nThe project is a testament to Iraq's enduring and progressive environmental governance. It embodies the principles of historical legislations and aligns with contemporary legal obligations, such as Iraq's commitment to the UN Water Convention, ensuring the project's operations remain within the ambit of national and international environmental mandates.  \nOur project prioritizes legal compliance throughout its design and operational phases. We ensure that all aspects of wastewater treatment, from pollutant removal to effluent discharge, adhere to the mandated environmental standards. This commitment extends to regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms, ensuring ongoing compliance and adaptation to any legal updates.\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project aligns with Iraq's key environmental laws, especially Law No. 27 of 2009. This law is the main legal document that outlines the environmental considerations for any project or activity to be carried out in the Country. \nAs per the requirements of The Iraqi Environmental protection and Enhancement Law no. 27 for year 2009, our team undertake to fulfill all the requirements such as\nConduct an EIA (Environment Impact Analysis) study prior to the commencement of any project activities.\nGet the prior approval of the Ministry of Environment (MoEn) before starting the project as per articles 10 & 11 of the Law no. 27 for 2009.\nProvide and implement pollution control measures using clean. technologies, this is to be associated to ensure the proper performance of these control measures, as per article 9 of the same law.\nProvide tools for measuring the levels of pollutants. Records should be kept and made available to MoEn when needed. If such tools cannot be provided by the establishment, the MoEn performs these measurements, as per article 9 of the same law.\nBuild a database for environmental protection and sustainability, as per article 9 of the same law.\nReduce pollution through using renewable energy technologies, as per article 9 of the same law.\nWe also undertake to fulfill the requirements of any other legislation and regulations imposed by the relevant Iraqi government organization for the protection of water resources.\n\n\n3.5 Sludge Management and Disposal  \nThe Vertical Treatment Shaft, when implemented and in operation, will capture almost all the solids (TSS) and organic contaminants (BOD) from going into the river as it is the case currently.  This will be achieved by the primary treatment in the first shaft and secondary treatment using the DAF system for solids separation in the second shaft.   Skimming and settled primary solids from the first shaft (estimated to be 1.5% dry solids) will be pumped to the sludge storage/thickening tank. The waste activated sludge from the DAF’s (expected to be approximately 3% dry solids) will be diverted from the return activated sludge line from the DAFs to the sludge storage/thickening tank. Primary sludge and secondary sludge will be thickened in the sludge storage/thickener tank. The combined thickened sludge will pass through dry solids screw presses, with the dried solids (20% dry solids) being deposited by conveyor into either a dump body truck or a roll-off container. The remaining effluent discharges will meet the water TSS and BOD limits as stated in the project objectives. The projected amount of  solids at 20% dry solids is estimated to be 1,300 tonnes per day which will bring huge improvement to water quality in the river.  Dried solids could be treated using dry bed area and could be used as a fertilizer after testing for incompatible pollutants.  \nWe propose that the drying beds at the Al Rustemiya Plant in Baghdad can be effectively utilized for the drying of the sludge generated from the two vertical treatment shafts at Medical City and the Al Zuyut Factory. Utilizing the existing infrastructure at the Al Rustemiya Plant presents a practical solution for managing the sludge produced by the wastewater treatment process. By repurposing these drying beds, we can streamline the sludge disposal process and ensure efficient handling of the waste material. This collaborative approach underscores our commitment to maximizing resource utilization and optimizing the operations of our wastewater treatment facilities in Baghdad.\n3.6 Potential Nationwide Benefits\nUtilizing this technology we see the following national benefits:\nScalability Across Diverse Geographies: The compact nature and minimal land use requirement of the Treatment Shaft make it an ideal solution for both densely populated urban areas and rural settings across Iraq. Its adaptability to different site conditions and capacities means that this solution can be scaled up or down, catering to the needs of various communities throughout the country.\nCost-Effective Infrastructure Development: The Treatment Shaft technology stands out for its cost efficiency, particularly in areas where land acquisition is challenging or financially prohibitive. By minimizing the need for extensive piping and reducing the space required for wastewater treatment facilities, this solution can lead to significant savings in infrastructure development and maintenance costs nationwide.\nEnvironmental Protection and Public Health: The deployment of the Treatment Shaft technology across Iraq has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of water bodies by treating wastewater to national discharge standards. This, in turn, benefits public health, supports agriculture, and preserves the natural beauty and environmental integrity of Iraq's diverse landscapes.\nA Model for Sustainable Development: By adopting this innovative wastewater treatment technology, Iraq can position itself as a leader in sustainable water management in the region. The Treatment Shaft solution offers a practical model for addressing pressing environmental challenges while supporting economic growth and enhancing the quality of life for its citizens.\n3.7 Local Impact of Medical City's Wastewater Discharge on the Tigris River\n\nRecent studies have underscored the alarming impact of wastewater discharge from Baghdad's Medical City on the Tigris River, a crucial water source for Iraq. The research by Al Satar and Sachit from Al-Mustansiriyah University specifically investigated the change in heavy metals concentrations in the Tigris River due to this discharge. Sampling water at three strategic points - upstream, at the discharge point, and downstream - they found a marked increase in heavy metal concentrations, including Pb, Cd, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Ag, particularly at the downstream point. This is a clear indication of the pollution load being added to the river by the hospital's wastewater.\nAnother study by Al-Obaidy et al. focused on assessing the overall water quality of the Tigris River within Baghdad, taking into account the effluents from both the Medical City and Al-Rasheed Power Plant. The application of the Water Quality Index (WQI) based on various parameters such as pH, Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), and others, revealed that the water quality ranged from very poor to unsuitable in different seasons. This degradation in water quality not only poses significant health risks to the local population, reliant on the river for various needs, but also threatens the river's aquatic life and ecological balance.\nThe findings from these studies make it evident that the discharge of untreated wastewater from Medical City is contributing significantly to the pollution of the Tigris River. This situation demands immediate attention and action, not only to protect public health but also to preserve the ecological integrity of this vital waterway. The government's intervention in implementing effective wastewater treatment solutions is imperative to mitigate these risks and ensure the long-term sustainability of the Tigris River as a crucial resource for Iraq.\n3.8 Environmental Impact Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management. Addressing the pressing environmental challenges in the Medical City area, this project introduces an advanced treatment shaft technology while ensuring strict adherence to Iraq's environmental laws. As the project progresses through the stages of development, each build will bring improvements to water quality, underscoring our commitment to long-term environmental preservation and the protection of the Tigris River.\nThe vertical treatment plant will be able to treat the effluent (waste water discharge) in the first year after the completion of the first shaft. Slowing the processes of polluting the river and reducing the damage to Dicle(Tigris) without waiting for the completion of the whole project.\nFinally, this report serves as compelling evidence of the feasibility, cost-saving, and land-saving advantages offered by our joint venture team's EPA award-winning and patented vertical shaft Wastewater Treatment Technology Solution. Through our collective efforts, we pave the way for a sustainable future, embodying Iraq's commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, the Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project represents a pivotal milestone in Iraq's pursuit of sustainable environmental management. Addressing the pressing environmental challenges in the Medical City area, this project introduces an advanced treatment shaft technology while ensuring strict adherence to Iraq's environmental laws. As the project progresses through the stages of development, each build will bring improvements to water quality, underscoring our commitment to long-term environmental preservation and the protection of the Tigris River.\n\n\nAlso please give me 5 pros and 5 cons and then a plan to imrove and a plan to mitigate",
