  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user needed urgent help creating markdown documentation for a 20-minute meeting with Aaron about the Wellbeing Project community platform, with only 5 minutes to prepare. They were developing a community resource concept focused on connecting people within a wellbeing-focused network, moving away from Aaron currently serving as a \"human router\" for member connections. The user emphasized wanting a \"resource not platform\" approach, incorporating ideas from Joe Edelman's work on values-based design and constitutive attentional policies.\n\nClaude created four comprehensive markdown files: a one-page executive summary, a detailed project proposal featuring a \"gift exchange model\" with peer interviews and seasonal check-ins, a strategic questions document with decision-forcing inquiries for Aaron, and a technical overview with three architecture options (Airtable/Zapier, Next.js/Supabase, or Mighty Networks hybrid). The proposal centered on reframing profile creation as gift-giving rather than data entry, with yearly rituals tied to login cycles, optional peer interviews to surface hidden talents, and eventual seasonal pulse check-ins for longitudinal wellbeing data.\n\nThe user demonstrated preferences for direct communication without flattery, constructive pushback on ideas, and practical implementation approaches. They mentioned working with Python for coding and appreciated metaphorical thinking when problem-solving. The conversation revealed their collaborative relationship with Aaron and involvement in the broader Hearth community, with potential integration considerations for Richard Davidson's assessment tool. Claude recommended the Next.js/Supabase solution as the optimal balance of customization, scalability, and development timeline, emphasizing the peer interview feature as a key differentiator from typical community directories.",

I'd like to kind of discuss it and design some initial ideas for how to do it best, and maybe the tech stack and tech architecture for it. You ready?”\n00:21\nYou said:\n“Okay, well, I'm part of a lot of networks, and I have seen a lot of networks try to create these databases and these sort of ways to catalog who's available and who's in the network, and I'm wondering what kind of best practices you've seen for that kind of process and practice, and if there's something that we can learn from what already exists, and maybe if there's already a software that does it.”\n00:27\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I'm not so interested in things like Airtable and community apps like the Mighty Network, etc. Although it might be good to, you know, catalog the available things and make kind of a list of them, even if there are some more niche custom software out there. But I'm more interested in the, you know, how do you get people to actually fill this thing out, what processes and maybe like CX or like community experience design we might want to take. It's not just about UX, right? So what are the facilitation approaches to make it something that people are excited to do or are willing to do? Yeah, how does it fit into the community and the way that things are happening already? Is there some things that we can learn from other networks? We are, for instance, I'm a part of a network called the Global Innovation Gathering. We have a website. You can call us up at the beginning to get the GIT. And we are trying to get people to fill things out and basically just send a bunch of messages on a big old WhatsApp. It gets messy and not everyone sees everything and things fly by. And, yeah, I'm just wondering, like, what kind of community experience approaches are there? And is this a problem or is this something that people have thought about? And if so, like, what is the scene I'm talking about or the job or I don't even know what to call it.”\n01:32\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, you know, we had some ideas about connecting it to moments of onboarding, maybe like making it a part of their quote-unquote application for, to be a part of the community, like, we need you to fill this out once a year, and we are wondering if it should be superstructured or if we should have it be more flexible. This is for a community called the Wellbeing Projects Ecosystem. There are a lot of sub-communities inside of it, and the problem that we're trying to solve is that there's just a lot of things that people are reaching out to the main team members at the Wellbeing Project, and they're wondering if there's another way to do this that doesn't actually take time. So they get to field a lot of questions about, like, what therapy practitioners do you know that might be great to, you know, go to, and, like, what other kind of, especially that, like, trusted networks or even things like practices or to be able to connect with each other. And I think that might be, like, one of the core things we would like to do is to help people not see it as, like, a platform where they just, we're forcing them to get onto it, but, like, a platform where they come when they have a need, but surprise, surprise, there are, like, vetted things on there that come from our network of very, like, interesting people connecting, like, well-being and impact. And I'm wondering what we can possibly do to have the sort of experience be great when they fill it in, but also what are all the things that we could actually ask and do to make this application useful? And does it need to be an app? Or, yeah, what can we do?”\n02:09\nYou said:\n“Okay, yeah, so I'm wondering, can you think of like five creative ways of how we might be able to get it to be connected to a kind of rhythm of, you know, gathering the information? And do we hold hostage information so that they have to fill something out to be able to get something out? How do we keep it as human as possible even though it's like a form? And do we let people share videos? Like what are the things that we should be gathering as well? Is there something that is sort of like maybe like an unseen hidden value? So we have, you know, people that are from practitioners, we have educators, we have a wide variety. You can check out the Wellbeing Projects website. I think that actually might be helpful if you want to check out the Wellbeing Projects website to see the different communities there. Can you check it out?”\n01:07\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I have a sense that something about, you know, we have a problem that we're trying to solve. Basically, Aaron, the founder of this project, came to me and was like, Yo, I'm just tired of answering the question, like, where's the therapist? And I'm wondering what other problems do you think stimulated this concern and this need? And why, so Aaron wants an app. I'm not sure why exactly. I think he wants to kind of make it a little broader and make it connected instead of like a separate app. I think it's supposed to be like, you know, they register, they log in, and they have access to things. But also, it's like, somehow it's related to this as well. I'm not exactly sure what that app's going to be. I'm going to talk to him a little bit later today. So maybe you can help me, like, gather some questions to ask as well. But, like, maybe we should also just do some brainstorming together on, like, what could the problems that he's facing actually be? And can we figure this out before my meeting with him in an hour? To show him that I did some thinking and some effort and sort of like, you know that idea of empathizing with somebody and showing them things that they didn't even know that they needed? Like, I'm trying to get to that kind of feeling.”\n01:33\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I think there's some really interesting things here. I definitely know he wants it to have a community element to it, and meeting people and connecting with people, I think that's important. They're a very relational sort of organization. But as you were speaking, I started realizing that there could be some really interesting things to do here, where we get people to talk to each other, because people sometimes don't know what they know. They don't know what's actually valuable. So if other people can help them see that through an interview process, it is a bit of an overhead, but it doesn't have to be everyone that does it. Maybe it can be self-selected peer interviewing people, and then getting some, yeah, digesting that and helping them fill out the form for them, so you don't fill it out for you. It's like a gift that we do for each other, and as a part of our community, we are givers, right? We're kind of focusing on maybe making it like an identity thing, and so maybe even the application form and the fields can have that element of who interviewed who to get this information. And then I'm thinking that there might be some other things about like a map, showing where people are around the world, and some other things that I'm not really able to articulate quite yet, but I'm feeling like there's some more interesting things that we can be doing, and yeah, I'd like you to have a say.”\n01:27\nYou said:\n“C'est bon, ça va, oui.”\n00:01\nYou said:\n“Yeah.”\n00:00\nYou said:\n“For any other ideas related, maybe you can come up with like five orthogonal divergence ideas that have kind of similar fields that align with the well-being project's goals.”\n00:09\nYou said:\n“No transcription available”\n03:08\nYou said:\n“Yeah, it's pretty good, but I think that, you know, we might have said a few things that aren't really present here, maybe in a notes section. I was also wondering if we could have an element of the ways of being, right? So, the whole thing about the Well-Being Project is like moving from well-being to, you know, well-doing to well-being. And I would like to use Joe Edelman's work on values and constitutive attentional policies, sort of structured in a way so that I can grab, you know, just get a clear articulation of not like the problem statement, but of like the beauty statement, right? Of like what is Aaron really trying to do here with this application? And what are like the constitutive attentional policies that people want to live into, right, that is about being rather than doing? And how can this, you know, is there anything worth maximizing is a question that Joe Edelman talks about, and what are we trying to design for the unfolding of rather than this maximizing of here? And of course, we don't want to call it, what was that, like constitutive attentional policies. Like that does not sound like the language that we want to use, but we want to use the idea behind it.”\n01:43\nYou said:\n“No, no, no, no, you got it. You're just repeating what I said. I'm asking you to think about what the well-being element, or the values that people want to live, that the app will help them live into, including the value for Aaron, the value for me as a designer, the value for the people that are holding the space, and the facilitators, and the group leads, and the value of the well-being team, and the value of the people inside of the communities. And what are we trying to do here, right? Are we trying to attend to moments where we can actually generously give to each other something that has been valuable to us? Or that's a really meaningful moment, like when you learn something that's been so helpful for you and you can give it to somebody else. So let's make a list of those kinds of things. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yeah.”\n00:55\nYou said:\n“Yeah, I do feel like there's more here in terms of the well-being and I think it's like for creating spaces of like emergence and surprise for the well-being project. So that means that we need some affordances where things that are like we wouldn't even imagine possible, possible, helping people see themselves as like, you know, owners of their own well-being and to feel a real sense of like we're a part of a movement that's changing the way that we see ourselves in the world. Maybe like something about, you know, the hearth, right? That's what they call these things and they want the hearth to be like a core thing here. So maybe it's something hearthy here.”\n00:46\nYou said:\n“Okay, go for it. And then, you know, return a mockdown file that I can download.”\n00:04\nYou said:\nOkay, great. So, can you make that markdown file? And also, can you make a tabular file for the different categories, and the different structures for all the ideas that we talked about so far, and kind of present a catalog of thoughts? And then, think critically about what a community manager might ask, and even what some of the participants might ask here, and ask me five pointed questions that will improve the quality of our idea.\nYou said:\nYeah, I think I'd like to also think about the technical data model and what the database looks like. I know that he wants it to be the personal login into the Wellbeing Project, and maybe the first time you log in, it's sort of like you have to fill out your profile page, and you just need to do that yearly to update your profile page. And I kind of like the idea of keeping track of changes, right? That is information. Not only the information of what is the current state, but the past state. Just so that we can say something about how someone has changed, or grown, or moved. I'm not sure how to use that information in a way that's heartfelt, and reasonable, and meaningful, and not privacy problematic. And yeah, I want you to think with me about how we can do this so that it doesn't feel like anything that they've ever done on a computer before. What can we do to make this profile development really unique and beautiful, actually? Come up with five divergent ways, first assess our conversation to understand my values and how I approach things, and then see if you can take that to come up with five divergent ways to bring it to life. What are my constitutive attentional policies? What would I find beautiful? And let's do it.\nYou said:\nOkay, so I'm gonna read what you wrote and then tell you how I feel, and you can update my constitutive attentional policies based on what I'm attending to in what you shared. So let's see. So you think generosity over extraction? Yeah, absolutely. Relationships over artifacts? Absolutely. Change over static? Yeah. Emergence over control? Reverence over optimization? Yeah, I love hearing the word optimism, and I think that part of me is thinking about like, yeah, this is kind of optimistic, and maybe something about realistic, and paced, and kind of fitting into someone's life in a way where it feels like a real asset, you know? Like, like money in the bank, something like that. I'm not sure what else I can describe it like, but you know, like when someone just knows that we've got your back, and can just trust fall? Yeah, something about like a trust fall, you know? I think that's really something that I think would be really wonderful to have. So the five divergent ways. Narrative first. I like that, although I'm not sure everyone can do it, and I think this connects to the idea of not having the time, right? And like just another assignment for people is a bit much, but I do like this idea of having it be like a place of reflection, like an optional place of reflection, and hey doggie! Yeah, and I feel like maybe something about the events that people go to, the Heart Summit, you know, we create a lot of connections and artifacts, and even especially in my group, we actually do a lot of these paper and pencil journaling and sharing in person, and we try to collect them, and we take pictures of everything at the end, and sometimes the organizers try to turn it into something, but I'm wondering if like there can be a photo section. You know, that's actually another thing that people really like, is music and photos, and we ask people on the WhatsApp group to share these things. Here's a like a personal thing for me, is like I don't like forgetting people's names for their partners, or if they have kids or not, or these kinds of things, and every once in a while I'm like, I don't know, and so that could like embarrassment reduction could be cool. Yeah, so here's how we might reflect this in your profile. Yeah, I'm wondering, should there be or should there not be a connection between the reflection section and your profile, and I'm really wondering how Richard Davidson's going to work on the assessment tool, so I feel like your profile should have your organization, and maybe even your profile should be able to invite other people from your organization into your profile, so that you can have that assessment connect all that data, but also I feel like it should be way simpler than that. This is turning into like a real big app, and what is the simpler thing that we can do, but yeah, the hearth letter, and you know like one cool thing that happens is people get Christmas letters, and I think the Wellbeing Project might be able to do a Christmas postcard. I kind of like that. I'm not sure exactly how or what it would entail, but I think there could be something really cool, and sharing something physical, and doing a like a Christmas postcard, and maybe having that be connected, could they like fill out some check boxes, and send a photo, or something that also sounds like something that might be really hard to facilitate, and that not everyone will do, and not everyone has a very clear home, or like a lot of gaps here, so something about practicality. History is used. Yeah, I don't think it should just be talking to them non-stop. That just sounds like a LLM, and kind of annoying. Everyone knows about LLMs now. It's not so interesting here, so let's go to the peer mirror. I like that. Something about working with some other humans, right, and connecting to them, and yeah, fill this out on my own, or co-create, and it could be like magic, or something like that, like we've magically selected this person for you that has maybe like common needs, or geographies, or it just could be really random, and we just tell them magic, and try to frame it that way, so that people start looking like, I wonder why I was matched with this person. Data model, interviews table, yeah, history, like what could this thing show, and I think that that's the real interesting thing here, is I feel like maybe with a fewer set of data points over time, we get a much more real idea of people's well-being journeys, and that way maybe we actually have, you know, less, technically less data points, but more meaningful data points, because it's data points over time, and I'm wondering if there's any research about that in terms of well-being assessments, or frameworks, and getting less data, but more quality data by going over time. Yeah, so peer mirror was interesting. Seasons wheel, microcheck, instead of forms. I like that seasons wheel, it's also how people do like happiness research, right? You just get like a quick note, it's like, hey, how are you doing, and I think there's something important about that, where we actually get people not in a state where, you know, there's a this book called Personality is Impermanent, which talks about all of these profiling approaches, and their problems, because it really depends on how they're feeling that day, and when they fill out the form, and even like context and framing, and doing it with this like random thing, where they get a pop-up message, and that pop-up message will ask them some questions, I think can be a great way to get around that. Offers wheel and needs loom. Yeah, I think just, I like the idea of keeping things hearthy, but also keeping things simple and clear, so offers and needs don't need to loomify things. Yeah, I wonder how to do that. Yeah, instead of generic skills, I think I like this idea of like a gift, right? It's a gift, and yeah, maybe even including like what they can do, right? I also feel like maybe some people might be able to host people, or even, you know, like if people need hookups somewhere in a geography, like they might be able to give that, so it's not just where they are, but like where they have experience and knowledge, and yeah, maybe like what I'd be willing to get on an half-hour, hour-long Zoom call and talk your head off about, right? I think a lot of people in this org have that capacity, and then maybe like a booking thing, right? Like it could start a process of getting into a Google Calendar or something like that. I don't know if that's too much. Ways of being constellation profiles. Yeah, ways of being. Yeah, growing into this part of me. I like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I really like this like ways of being element. It's also a way of kind of flagging and indicating what for ourselves and for others, like what we're trying to grow into and who we're trying to become. How to attract users. Versioning strategy. Yeah, so let's see what the nothing is like. Framing. Yeah, rituals I think are great, but how do we keep it ritual? Provenance. I like the idea of provenance, and yeah, so when you interview somebody, and maybe like we say who introduced you to the Wellbeing Project. That is less like who's your favorite Wellbeing Project person, but it also helps develop a kind of a network. We have some dimensionality and directionality, and we can also see like who are the network builders here, and yeah, that could be kind of interesting, but I'm wondering what else we could do besides like who introduced the network. It's like who did you speak with last in the network, or who who offered you a gift, and what was it in the network that made a difference for you in your way of being, right? And I think that way we can also just use that for the highlighting like the member of the year or something. If we do any sort of analysis, then yes consent gates the reflection back I don’t think I really want an AI here I think AI does. should trigger a connection to a real human being and I wonder how to open that up like we don’t want this to be the community platform. It’s supposed to be a resource so how do we really emphasize the resource angle and not the platform angle we a lot of these are like platform Matic but Aaron was mentioning that. Yeah they come on and it’s a resource and yeah, I think yeah there’s idea of like there’s gold here in this network that sort of emerges in moments where people connect and there’s like serendipity and I like that serendipity of like the in person stuff and then having the one time a year thing is interesting but maybe there can be like the seasonal pulse point right and it could be an optional thing that people opt into it. How would you like to receive a seasonal text message that you can respond to where it kind of can update your profile but also is like a check in on how things are going. Moment of reflection \nYou said:\nYeah, can you get the sources and then maybe come up with a very clear way to cite some of our decisions or maybe like you can even ask me some questions to make this these decisions and then say okay well we made this decision because of this research and then we made this decision because of that research especially if it's modern well-cited and um wow and relevant and yeah not like non-repeatable you know research that is just bogus we want some some solid stuff that's uh that passes the replicability issues that we've been seeing in the social sciences\nYou said:\nok, can you make the md file so i can take these things and share them in a clear way with aaron"

Includes my pushback on resource vs platform tension.\n\n**[technical-overview.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/technical-overview.md)** - Data model and 3 architecture options.

Integration Architecture\n**Q:** How does this connect to Richard Davidson's assessment tool?  \n**Why it matters:** Determines if we need org-level profiles, team connections, shared data structures.  \n**Decision needed:** Are these separate systems or does one feed the other?\n\n### 2. Resource vs Platform Spectrum\n**Q:** On a scale of \"simple directory\" to \"full community platform,\" where do you actually want to land?  \n**Why it matters:** Determines features, maintenance burden, technical complexity.  \n**Pushback:** You said \"resource not platform\" but some ideas (forums, AI chat) are platform-y. Which wins?\n\n### 3. Launch Strategy\n**Q:** Hearth Summit 2026 as launch vehicle? Or soft launch before?  \n**Why it matters:** Informs timeline, what's MVP, whether we can pilot with one community first.  \n**Opportunity:** Summit creates natural moment to \"capture connections made here\"\n\n### 4. Ownership & Facilitation\n**Q:** Who internally owns the ongoing rituals (yearly updates, seasonal pulses)?  \n**Why it matters:** Tech is easy. Facilitation is hard. Without a champion, databases become graveyards.  \n**Reality check:** This needs 5-10hrs/month of community stewardship to stay alive.\n\n### 5. Privacy Model\n**Q:** What's visible to who? Opt-in for everything or default-public within network?  \n**Why it matters:** Affects trust, adoption, and legal considerations.  \n**Example tensions:** \"Ways of being\" (growth edges) might be vulnerable - public or private?\n\n## Validation Questions\n\n### 6. Problem Severity\n**Q:** How often do you field \"who do you know who...\" questions? Weekly? Daily?  \n**Why it matters:** Validates if this is solving a real pain or a nice-to-have.\n\n### 7. Hidden Assumptions\n**Q:** When you imagine this working, who's using it? What percentage of network engages?  \n**Reality check:** Most community directories have <30% complete profiles. What's success here?\n\n### 8. Resource Constraint\n**Q:** Budget range? DIY vs contractor vs platform solution?  \n**Why it matters:** Determines if we're talking Airtable + Zapier or custom Next.js app.\n\n## Provocations (Push Back)\n\n### 9. The Null Hypothesis\n**Q:** What if we don't build this? Could quarterly \"who has X\" emails to community leaders solve 80% of the problem for 5% of the effort?  \n**Pushback:** Sometimes the answer is \"don't build software.\"\n\n### 10. The Real Job-to-Be-Done\n**Q:** Is this about information access or about making the network *feel* more connected?  \n**Why it matters:** If it's the latter, different solutions emerge (gatherings, stories, rituals vs databases).\n\n---\n\n## My Hunch (Bilal's Take)\n\nThe peer interview approach is the killer feature - it:\n- Makes profile creation relational (not homework)\n- Surfaces hidden gifts people don't know they have\n- Creates micro-connections before directory lookup\n- Builds ownership through participation\n\nBut it only works if framed as **optional gift-giving** not mandatory onboarding.\n\nThe danger: building too much too fast. Start with bare minimum - profiles with gifts/needs/ways-of-being, launch at Summit, see what people actually use before adding complexity.\n\n---\n\n*Meeting prep: 5 pointed questions first, then validation, then provocation if time allows*\n",
