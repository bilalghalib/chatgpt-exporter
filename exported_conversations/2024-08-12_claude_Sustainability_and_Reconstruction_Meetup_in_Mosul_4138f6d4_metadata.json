Welcoming a broad spectrum of stakeholders in Mosul to a session sharing insights, best practices, and activities. Ask me 5 questions to help you help me write this one pager. It should also contain a draft invitation letter that Mosul Space can use to send to the community to invite people from universities, businesses, youth, and politicians/regulatory people",

It's also a way to learn more about what skills/competencies might be needed to strengthen in the community. We will be asking people to present a 5-10 min short impromptu presentation on their research/projects/business/legistation and how they are connected to the concept of sustainable reconstruction and ask them what their dream is, what's going well, and what they need/and or are blocked. Maybe we need to come up with the questions they can answer so it's clear/easy and people don't get frozen, I might need help here, ideas? I'll include the BEIT project document as a pdf here so you can get an overview of what it is, as well as a document explaining the needs. Informal presentations with live note taking highlighting relationships/commonalities. I hope to meet a broad swatch of the ecosystem stakeholders and learn about potential skills needed and to find potential training partners and to be sure that the people there start to see themselves as a part of a sustainability community working together to rebuild their city - I'd also like to be sure that everyone in attendance has a sense that they have benefitted personally from the meeting",

        "excerpt": "1. so far my plan was to work on awareness of the issues by demonstrating the environmental costs of standard practices, and creating awareness of the ecological and economic challenges of business as usual, and then moving towards inspiration by sharing case studies of places, methods, and techniques that can support using locally available materials and techniques a more sustainable housing development and then finishing up with application - an 'exam' which consists of proposing a site / refurbish home and to ask them to review the site, water, energy, materials although I feel like I'm missing stuff here. And i'm not 100% sold on my training design. Do you have suggestions? 2. Affordable house construction is addressed by using local materials and reducing long term costs due to resource efficiency and - financial literacy is addressed as a component of assessing overall costs of implementation and calculations for reduction of running costs as compared to initial capital costs, repairs are addressed also through the use of local materials and local knowledge. 3. I've interviewed 3 stakeholders so far and am continuing to interview people... Top 3 Insights: Financial Literacy (Significant gap in financial literacy among businesses, Need for financial management understanding), Community Engagement (Value of community networks and initiatives like TEDx Baghdad), Continuous Learning (Importance of lifelong learning and professional development). Top 3 Gaps: Financial Literacy Content (Lack of foundational financial literacy training), Professional Development (Inadequate emphasis on ongoing learning opportunities), Inclusivity in Curriculum (Need for tailored and accessible content for all groups)... 4. I'm still outreaching to Lafarge - the university and others in Iraq to interview them 5. youth are the main outreach area for the program training and they are also being interviewed",

Through these interviews and research I'm developing an understanding of the importance of: 1) we need to start simple - people need to learn the basics 2) it's important to light people's passion about sustainability 3) practical knowledge is critical 4) diversifying the landscape of the educational offers in Mosul is important 5) the importance of governmental incentives in addition to the disincentives - carrot and stick 6) mindset is critical - creativity, systems thinking, problem framing, valuing sustainability 7) learning connected to contribution and recognition is important 8) connect sustainability education with follow up paths",

Module 1: Introduction to Sustainable Construction, Module 2: Affordable House Construction, Module 3: Sustainable Repair and Maintenance, Module 4: Resource Efficiency, Module 5: Financial Literacy for Construction, Module 6: Practical Application. Questions i have are how much to focus on overall sustainability consideration for new construction vs retrofitting. Financial literacy becoming a component that is cross cutting across modules. I could benefit from more connections with people in the financial sector as well as support in identifying the current active policies around green and environmental construction.
