Some of his other iconic artworks include:\n\n- \"Sunflower Seeds\" (2010): A massive installation made up of over 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds, each handcrafted by artisans in Jingdezhen, China. The work explores themes of mass production, individuality, and the relationship between China and the West.\n- \"Forever Bicycles\" (2011): A sculpture made from over 1,000 bicycles that creates a dizzying maze of intersecting wheels. The work comments on the rapid pace of urbanization in China and the changing nature of transportation in the country.\n- \"Trace\" (2014): A series of portraits made from Lego bricks that depict over 175 people who have been detained, exiled, or silenced by the Chinese government. The work speaks to issues of political censorship, human rights, and freedom of expression.\n\nThe principles that Ai Weiwei's artworks follow can vary depending on the specific work and context, but some key themes and ideas that are present across many of his works include:\n\n- Critique of power structures: Ai Weiwei often uses his art to comment on issues of political power, censorship, and social justice, challenging dominant narratives and oppressive forces.\n- Repurposing of materials: Many of Ai Weiwei's works involve the repurposing of everyday objects or materials, transforming them into something new and meaningful.\n- Emphasis on collaboration and community: Ai Weiwei often works with teams of artisans, activists, and other collaborators to create his artworks, emphasizing the importance of community and collective action.\n\nHere are some examples of how these principles could be applied to artworks inspired by three ancient cultures:\n\n- Ancient Greece: An artist inspired by ancient Greek culture could create a sculpture made from pieces of discarded marble, commenting on the legacy of classical sculpture and its impact on contemporary art. The work could involve collaborations with contemporary Greek artists or activists, highlighting the importance of community and solidarity in the face of political turmoil and economic hardship.\n- Mayan civilization: An artist inspired by Mayan culture could create an installation made from pieces of traditional Mayan textiles or pottery, repurposing them into a new form that reflects the resilience and creativity of indigenous cultures. The work could speak to issues of cultural erasure, environmental degradation, and social inequality, highlighting the ongoing struggles faced by indigenous communities in Mexico and Central America.\n- Ancient Egypt: An artist inspired by ancient Egyptian culture could create a series of portraits made from found objects or materials, such as discarded artifacts or pieces of hieroglyphics. The work could comment on the enduring legacy of ancient Egypt and its impact on contemporary culture, while also drawing attention to issues of cultural appropriation, colonialism, and the preservation of cultural heritage.",

His art is a form of resistance against oppression and injustice in his country, with a focus on revealing the truth about the ongoing conflicts and giving voice to those who have been silenced.\n\nAl-Husseini's most iconic work, \"Baghdad Ruins,\" is a mixed-media installation that features rubble from bombed-out buildings in Baghdad. The work is a powerful representation of the destruction and devastation caused by the ongoing conflict in Iraq, and the toll it has taken on the Iraqi people. By using actual pieces of the ruins, Al-Husseini brings the reality of the conflict into the gallery space, forcing viewers to confront the human cost of war and conflict.\n\n\"Baghdad Ruins\" is a powerful statement against the ongoing violence and instability in Iraq, and a call for greater attention and action to address the root causes of the conflict. Through his work, Al-Husseini seeks to give voice to the silenced and reveal the truth about the ongoing struggles faced by the Iraqi people.",
