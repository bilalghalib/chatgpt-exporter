This is part of my contract helping five one labs in erbil iraq \"Green\" their curriculum and make it more sustainable, thi sis in the ethics presentation: \"\"\"15 minutes: Discussion\n\nHave a discussion around ethics. Some questions you might want to ask to encourage discussion include:\nCan someone tell me what they know about ethics?\nWhat do ethics look like in the business context? What are ethics in business? \nHow are business ethics and high ethical standards linked to business sustainability?\nWho are all of the people impacted by your business (stakeholders)? Why is it important to take care of them?\n\nSome of these points probably came up in the discussion. Maybe someone mentioned following the law as a part of ethics. Or not, so you can bring it up now. \nBasically, there are 2 types of ethics:\nCompliance based: This is doing the bare minimum. You follow the laws and do what you are supposed to do. The idea here is not to do any harm. However, sometimes the laws might not be perfect and still do harm. This is difficult because laws are different in different locations because of cultural differences. What might not be ethical in some cultures (child labor for instance), are perfectly accepted in other places in the world. \nDo no harm (hopefully)\nFollow laws\nFollow guidelines provided by an organization or group telling you what you can and can’t do. \nPenalties for violations\n\nValues based: Because laws aren’t perfect, they leave room for businesses to damage people, communities, and the environment. Based on personal choices and values (without disregarding logical business rationale), you can choose to have your business have a positive impact on society. It takes a bit of extra work, but your business will have an impact on so many people. Some people might argue that you have a moral duty to do good with your business. \nDo good. Do more than the minimum legal requirements and expectations to do what you think is right. \nCompany core values. Act with your company core values in mind.\nSelf regulation. Hold yourself accountable and do good even when nobody’s watching.\nExtra effort. Put in a little extra effort to be the best version of your business that can possibly exist. \"\"\"",

      "content": "Here's an updated version of your ethics discussion that aligns with your focus on authenticity, coming alive, and the business benefits of aligning values with meaning. It connects to the idea that businesses thrive when they embody a deep \"why\" and cultivate meaningful relationships with customers and stakeholders. This version also frames ethics as a source of strategic strength and long-term sustainability, rather than just compliance or obligation.\n\n---\n\n### 15-Minute Discussion: Ethics and Business That Comes Alive  \n\nEthics isn’t just about rules—it’s about what makes a business truly meaningful, sustainable, and connected to the people it serves. Businesses that thrive over the long term do so because they align with values that matter—not just to themselves, but to their customers, employees, and communities.  \n\nLet’s explore what ethics means in business. Some questions to consider:  \n\n- What do ethics mean to you? How do they show up in the business world?  \n- What businesses do you trust the most? Why?  \n- How do ethical values help businesses attract customers and build long-term relationships?  \n- Who is impacted by your business? What happens when businesses act in ways that respect or harm their stakeholders?  \n- Have you ever been in a situation where a business decision felt wrong, even if it was legal? What did that teach you about the difference between compliance and deeper values?  \n\n#### Two Approaches to Ethics  \n\n##### **1. Compliance-Based Ethics** – Doing the Minimum  \nThis is the \"stay out of trouble\" model. Businesses following this approach focus on:  \n- Following laws and regulations (which vary across regions and may not always align with deeper moral values).  \n- Avoiding harm or penalties rather than proactively doing good.  \n- Checking boxes rather than engaging in true responsibility.  \n\nMany businesses operate this way, but it often leads to short-term thinking, loss of trust, and disconnection from customers and employees who crave something more meaningful.  \n\n##### **2. Values-Based Ethics** – Making Your Business Come Alive  \nThis approach sees ethics as an engine for long-term success. It’s about **aligning your business with its deepest why**—because when businesses act in ways that resonate with meaning, they attract people who believe in them. This model includes:  \n- **Doing good, not just avoiding harm.** Moving beyond the bare minimum to create real impact.  \n- **Aligning with core values.** Businesses that live their values build stronger customer loyalty and employee commitment.  \n- **Self-regulation and integrity.** Doing the right thing, even when no one is watching, builds a reputation that attracts partners, customers, and investors.  \n- **Putting in the extra effort.** The best businesses are not just efficient; they are deeply aligned with their purpose, and that makes them magnetic.  \n\n### The Business Case for Values-Based Ethics  \n- **Customers choose brands that reflect their own values.** Trust is the foundation of business, and ethical businesses attract loyal customers.  \n- **Employees want to work for companies that stand for something.** People give their best when they feel their work is meaningful.  \n- **Investors and partners increasingly value long-term sustainability.** Ethical businesses often outperform competitors because they minimize risk and create deeper trust.  \n- **Resilience in crisis.** A strong values foundation helps businesses navigate challenges while maintaining their integrity and support systems.  \n\nAt the core, ethics isn’t a restriction—it’s an opportunity. A business that understands *why* it exists and aligns its actions with that deeper meaning will always find *how* to succeed.  \n\n---\n\nThis version shifts the focus from ethics as a constraint to ethics as a catalyst for meaningful, successful businesses. It reflects your belief that businesses thrive when they align with values that resonate deeply with their customers and stakeholders. Let me know if you want any refinements!",

Let’s start with some questions: \nDiscussion Questions (10 minutes):\nWhen someone says 'ethics,' what's the first thing that comes to mind for you?\nHow might authenticity create business advantages that aren't easily replicated?\nWhat happens when a business operates in alignment with the founder's deepest values? \nWhen have you felt most alive in your work, and how might that energy translate to business success?\nHave you experienced or observed situations where businesses staying true to their core values succeeded because of that authenticity?\nThink about everyone your business touches—customers, team members, the local community, even the environment. Why does keeping these stakeholders in mind matter for your long-term success?\n\nAs the discussion unfolds, help participants see the two fundamental approaches to ethics: \nEncourage real stories and examples of situations in which businesses either lost trust by cutting corners or gained loyalty by adhering to their core values.\nEthics aren't simply about staying out of trouble; they bring authenticity and purpose to your actions. It's about knowing your 'why' so clearly that it helps you overcome any 'how.' Let’s explore that together.\"\nWrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):\n\"We’ve probably talked about two main ways businesses think about ethics: compliance and values. Let’s quickly unpack what each means and why it matters.\"\nTwo Paths to Ethics: Compliance vs. Values\nCompliance-Based Ethics: Playing Safe\nDoing the minimum required by law, following guidelines, and avoiding penalties.\nIt’s about keeping out of trouble and avoiding harm.\nLimitation: Laws vary by location and might not address all ethical issues. Compliance alone doesn't make your business stand out or connect deeply with customers or employees.\nValues-Based Ethics: Igniting Purpose\nDoing more than what's required because you have a strong purpose and a set of core values guiding your actions.\nActing authentically and proactively—even when no one’s watching—because your 'why' drives you.\nEmbracing extra effort because it aligns with your values, making your work meaningful.\nWhy Values Ignite Your Business:\nCustomer Connection: People support businesses whose stories and values align with their own. Authenticity builds trust, loyalty, and lasting relationships.\nTeam Loyalty: Employees stay motivated when they feel their work contributes to something meaningful beyond just earning a paycheck.\nLong-term Resilience: Businesses guided by strong values better adapt to challenges and thrive in uncertainty.\nCompetitive Edge: Authenticity helps your business stand out clearly and powerfully in a crowded marketplace.\nClosing Thought:\nWe’re focused not just on building startups, but on supporting authentic, purpose-driven businesses that naturally attract customers and inspire others. Ethics, aligned with authenticity and values, can become your strategic advantage.\nEpictetus has said:  \"First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to.\" ",

Let's see how we can rework this slide: \n\"\"\"\nTHINK ABOUT YOUR CORE VALUES\n\n\n\nResponsibility\n\nInnovation\n\nTeamwork\n\nCommitment\n\nIntegrity\"\"\" and the facilitator notes: \"\"\"3-5 minutes: Lecture\n\nThis slide is a placeholder so that entrepreneurs can take out their core values and mission statements from Ignite.\nWhat we will do now is think about ways to actually accomplish our stated values through the triple bottom line business model. How can you “activate” the purpose behind your business (instead of just having values that are never worked towards accomplishing)?\"\"\"",
