      "content": "I'm writing a breakup letter with a friend and cofounder, I would like you to critique it for clarity and to ensure we maintain our friendship after not working together and offer advice as a professional coach, here's the letter:\nKey Points:\nWe differ in our strategic direction. To keep Bloom unified and aligned I will step down as an active co-founder and move to the board as an advisor.\nI need time and space to open new project/funding opportunities.\nA notice: I will be likely offering similar workshops/projects to ones Bloom runs\nA notice: I would like to continue to use our software independently\nI offer a profit share for use of potential future software\nThe long form:\nDear Munir\nAs you know, I have just moved into my new apartment here in Lille and my expenses currently take 80% of my average take home pay for the next year. \n\nI have spent six amazing years working on Bloom with you, and it's been incredible to see what we've built together. However, with a child arriving in October and my apartment rent consuming 80% of my take-home pay, I need to restructure my work life. My goal is to make time for other projects and consulting gigs that will bring in additional revenue streams.\n\nYou and I have been noticing differences regarding strategic direction and I’ve been thinking that to protect Bloom we need to have a single guiding star. To streamline the process, I think it would be best for you to handle the strategic elements while I focus on creating new revenue streams for my growing family. I am offering to move from an active co-founder to being on the board and offering my advice.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to run projects parallel to Bloom's mission using my skill set and network. In doing so, I'll use my own name rather than leveraging Bloom’s name/branding.\nMy work on the learning system has been my main contribution and I would like to indicate my intention to continue to use the concept and software to continue exploring its use for projects and programs I run as well as furthering it as a software tool to help in learning discovery and activation. While I would like to use it mainly as an internal tool, I also would like to offer 70% for myself and 30% for Bloom profit share. Also, if the software fork becomes independently useful, I offer free licensing to Bloom to use the simplified version, that is if I do follow through on this intention.\n\nBy implementing these changes, we can both continue growing professionally while ensuring our individual goals are met.\n",

      "content": "Dear [Your Name],\n\nYour letter is well-structured, transparent, and empathetic. The points you've laid out are clear, and the tone is respectful, which will greatly contribute to maintaining a healthy friendship with Munir post-breakup. I do have some suggestions to improve clarity and ensure your points are well-received.\n\n1. Addressing Personal Constraints: You've effectively communicated your personal constraints and why they necessitate this decision. It would also be beneficial to show some gratitude towards Munir for understanding your position, given your upcoming life changes.\n\n2. Role Change: You clearly stated your intention to step down from active involvement to a board role. You could further specify your envisioned role on the board, how frequently you aim to be involved, and how you plan to contribute.\n\n3. Future Projects: You've explained your plans to undertake new projects and that these may be similar to those of Bloom. To avoid any potential misunderstanding, clarify that these new projects are purely motivated by your financial situation, not a desire to compete with Bloom.\n\n4. Software Use: You've been upfront about your intent to use the learning system software independently. To soften this, reassure Munir that you respect Bloom's intellectual property rights and would only use the software within legal and ethical bounds. \n\n5. Profit Share Proposal: Your offer of a profit-sharing agreement is a thoughtful gesture. However, it could potentially be seen as contentious. Consult with a lawyer to ensure this agreement doesn't pose any potential issues down the line. \n\nHere is a revised version of your letter, integrating the above points:\n\n---\n\nDear Munir,\n\nI trust this letter finds you well. As you know, I recently moved into a new apartment here in Lille, and with a child on the way in October, my current financial commitments require a restructuring of my work life to facilitate other projects and consulting gigs.\n\nI am incredibly grateful for the six amazing years we've spent building Bloom together, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished. During this time, I've come to deeply respect your strategic vision. Given our differing views on the strategic direction, I believe it would be best for the unity of Bloom if you handle the strategic elements, while I step back from active involvement.\n\nTo clarify, my intent is not to disassociate completely from Bloom. I would be honored to serve as an advisor on the board, contributing my insights and expertise when needed. This would allow me to focus on creating new revenue streams while still supporting the growth and success of Bloom.\n\nIn the course of my new ventures, I might run projects that parallel Bloom's mission, leveraging my own skill set and network. I assure you that this decision is not a desire to compete with Bloom but purely motivated by my financial circumstances.\n\nOver the years, I have contributed to the learning system, which I intend to continue using in my future projects. I want to reassure you that this would be done in complete respect of Bloom's intellectual property rights and within the boundaries of the law.\n\nIf these projects generate profit, I propose a 70/30 profit-sharing arrangement in favor of me, given that the initiatives will be run under my direct supervision. Please consider this as an initial suggestion, and I am open to further discussions.\n\nI am confident that with these changes, we can continue to grow professionally and meet our individual goals. I appreciate your understanding and support in these challenging times, and I look forward to our continued collaboration and friendship.\n\nBest Regards,\n[Your Name]",

It's a good move to suggest an open conversation about licensing and possible cooperation on future projects. The commitment to maintaining the company's unity, and the value you place on your shared history, are also clear.\n\nAddressing the issue of ownership and loan compensation is tricky as it can be contentious.

I trust you understand that the dedication and resources I’ve committed over the past six years reflect in my 35% share. This share also represents my belief in the continued potential of Bloom.\n\nMoreover, I hope that as the company continues to grow and become profitable, there can be a consideration for compensation for the loans I've extended to the company during its early stages. This is not an immediate concern, but I believe it's important to discuss it now to avoid any future misunderstanding.\n\nIn the course of my new ventures, it’s likely that my future projects will be working in parallel with Bloom's mission, leveraging my own skill set and network.

      "content": "Dear [Your Name],\n\nYour revised letter maintains a good balance of professionalism and the personal touch necessary in addressing a friend. It effectively communicates your plans and shows respect for your shared history while also articulating your needs for the future. Here's a minor adjustment to maintain the seriousness and friendliness you want in your letter:\n\n---\n\nDear Munir,\n\nI trust this letter finds you well. I'm reaching out in the spirit of transparency and respect that has underscored our friendship and professional partnership over the past six years at Bloom.\n\nAs you're aware, my personal circumstances are changing - with my recent move to Lille and a child on the way, I find it necessary to restructure my professional commitments. This is in no way a reflection on our shared venture, but rather a personal requirement to create space for new projects and financial opportunities.\n\nOur journey with Bloom has been rewarding, and I hold deep respect for your strategic vision. However, as we've noticed differences in our perspectives on strategic direction, I think it would be best for Bloom's unity if you took the lead on the strategic front. I intend to step down from my current active co-founder role and contribute as an advisor on the board, a position I believe will let me support Bloom's growth while also exploring new revenue streams.\n\nAs we move forward, I'd like to discuss some essential points. Firstly, we should consider compensation for the loans both you and I have extended to the company during its early stages. It's not an immediate concern, but it's vital to address this to avoid future misunderstandings.\n\nSecondly, despite my step back from active involvement, I'd like to maintain my current ownership stake in Bloom. This stake represents not just my past contributions but also my belief in Bloom's continued potential. I hope you'll understand and respect my decision to retain my 35% share.\n\nRegarding my new ventures, it's possible that I may be working on projects that run parallel to Bloom's mission. I assure you that this is not an attempt to compete with Bloom, but rather a way to ensure my financial security. I'm open to discussing ways this can be beneficial for both parties.\n\nOne crucial part of my journey with Bloom has been my work on the learning system. I would like to continue using the software and the concept for future projects, and furthering its use as a learning tool. I propose that we discuss a licensing agreement to share potential future profits, always ensuring respect for Bloom's intellectual property. If the software evolves into an independent tool, I'd be happy to offer Bloom free licensing to use the simplified version, should I choose to go in that direction.\n\nBy implementing these changes, I believe we can balance our professional growth and individual goals while maintaining the respect and friendship that our partnership is built on.\n\nThank you, Munir, for your understanding and support in this transition. I look forward to our continued collaboration.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name] \n\n---\n\nThis letter aims to express your needs while maintaining a sincere and professional tone. It also seeks to reassure Munir of your continued commitment to the company and your shared goals.",
