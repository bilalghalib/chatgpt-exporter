      "content": "For brewing Sencha, a common ratio is about 2 grams of tea leaves per 150 ml (grams) of water. This ratio can be adjusted based on personal taste preferences, with more leaves for a stronger brew or fewer for a lighter one. Remember, these are guidelines and experimenting with different ratios can help you find your preferred strength.",

      "content": "For brewing Sencha, the recommended water temperature is between 70°C to 80°C (158°F to 176°F). Steeping time typically ranges from 1 to 2 minutes. Starting with a shorter steeping time and adjusting based on your taste preference is a good approach. Over-steeping can result in a bitter flavor, so it's best to keep an eye on the time.",
