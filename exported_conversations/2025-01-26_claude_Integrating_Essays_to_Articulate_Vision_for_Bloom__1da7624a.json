            "extracted_content": "From Metrics to Meaning: A New Vision for Social Impact\nPart I: From Doing Good to Recognizing Beauty\nThe Moment Everything Changed\nIn Dubai, watching entrepreneurs share their stories during our retreat, something shifted. As tears flowed and hearts opened, I witnessed something our carefully designed metrics and platforms could never capture: the pure beauty of people fully aligned with their calling. It wasn't just emotional response - it was recognition of something real, something our impact frameworks weren't built to see.\nThe Two Ways of Seeing\nI felt this tension acutely when invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera. Despite our impressive metrics and frameworks, something felt inauthentic. We had constructed a story of impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge and speak for itself. This wasn't about inadequate measurement - it was about a fundamental misalignment in how we were seeing.\nBeyond Best Practices\nInitially, our approach made perfect sense: validate assessments, unify a fragmented impact industry, track progress across accelerator programs. But as I worked with more entrepreneurs, I began to see something different. Every real success story was unique - not because it defied measurement, but because it emerged from authentic connection to meaning.\nThis isn't about abandoning measurement but about seeing with both eyes:\n\nOne eye for metrics and frameworks\nOne eye for direct quality recognition\nBoth needed for depth perception\n\nThe Nature of Real Authority\nWhat makes Father Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries so powerful isn't his impact metrics - it's the simple truth when he says \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability; it's revealing a different kind of authority that comes from authentic relationship rather than constructed impact.\nA Different Kind of Story\nWe've learned that social enterprises need more than problem-solution narratives. They need stories that:\n\nEmerge from real meaning\nEvolve organically\nConnect specifically to sources of meaning\nCreate natural resonance\n\nWhen entrepreneurs connect with their true sources of meaning, they naturally:\n\nAttract aligned resources\nBuild authentic relationships\nCreate lasting impact\nEnable natural growth\n\nThe Path Forward\nThis suggests a fundamental shift in how we support social impact:\n\nFrom constructing impact to recognizing beauty\nFrom forcing growth to enabling emergence\nFrom measuring change to embodying meaning\nFrom doing good to being alive\n\nPart II: What's Really Missing - Beyond Metrics to Meaning\nThe Tension We All Feel\nThe rushing tells us something. When we feel constantly hurried at Bloom, when we push to build software before ensuring it serves real needs, when we chase metrics that don't quite capture what matters - these aren't just operational issues. They're symptoms of a deeper misalignment: trying to achieve meaningful ends through instrumental means.\nThe Different Quality of Non-Instrumental Action\nFather Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries illuminates this distinction perfectly. When asked about his \"impact metrics,\" he offers something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability - it's recognizing that real impact emerges from genuine relationship, not instrumental calculation.\nThis shows up in how we feel about our work. When invited to speak about Bloom on Al Jazeera, I felt a deep unease - not because the work wasn't valuable, but because I sensed it wasn't yet flowing from that place of pure recognition and response. The contrast with Father Greg's natural authority was stark: his impact flows from friendship, while I was still caught in metrics and justification.\nThe Nature of Quality Recognition\nWhat we're missing isn't another framework or better metrics. It's trust in our capacity to recognize quality directly. This isn't intuition or emotion, though these can point us toward it. Rather:\n\nEmotions and tension often signal blocked meaning\n\"Have to\" versus \"want to\" reveals instrumental thinking\nRushing indicates misaligned action\nQuality recognition feels like natural rightness\n\nFrom Signals to Sources\nThe key shift happens when we learn to read these signals not as problems to solve but as pointers toward blocked sources of meaning:\n\nTension points to possibilities we're not seeing\nFear indicates protection rather than presence\nRushing reveals misaligned timing\nDoubt suggests disconnection from quality\n\nWhen we feel that sliminess of inauthenticity or the tension of forced metrics, we're receiving valuable information. These feelings aren't the truth itself - they're signals pointing toward a truth we already recognize but haven't yet trusted or acted upon.\nThe Practice of Presence\nDeveloping this capacity requires specific practices:\n\nSlowing down to sense what's really needed\nAddressing emotions directly to see what they reveal\nMaking clear decisions that reduce mental noise\nCreating space for quality recognition\nBuilding from authentic relationship\n\nThe result isn't slower work but what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - action that flows naturally from recognition rather than being forced by metrics or fear.\nPart III: Gardens, Craft, and Seeing - Natural Models for Social Impact\nThe Wisdom of Gardens\nWhen we approach social impact like gardeners rather than factory managers, everything changes. A gardener needs tomatoes, yes - there are real outcomes to achieve. But they understand something profound about how change happens: you can't force a seed to grow. You can only create conditions that support its natural unfolding.\nThis isn't passive - it requires deep engagement:\n\nReading the soil and weather\nUnderstanding natural cycles\nLearning from experience\nPlanning for lean times\nResponding to challenges\n\nBut it's a different kind of engagement. Instead of attempting to control outcomes through force, we participate in something larger. This creates natural resilience rather than artificial stability.\nThe Craft Way of Seeing\nCraft offers another crucial model. When a craftsperson works with materials, something remarkable happens: mere stuff becomes relationship. A pot isn't just clay shaped by technique - it's a conversation between maker, material, and eventual user. This transforms how we understand quality and scale:\nQuality Through Relationship\n\nDirect material engagement\nBalance of measurement and feeling\nIntegration of planning and presence\nNatural sustainability through care\n\nLearning Through Tradition\n\nMastering form before innovation\nKnowledge passed through practice\nCommunity-held wisdom\nDeep material understanding\n\nNatural Scale\n\nQuality reduces waste\nLocal materials create resilience\nSkills build community\nBeauty spreads naturally\n\nThe Integration of Measurement and Meaning\nWhat makes craft particularly relevant for social impact is how it naturally integrates quantitative and qualitative understanding. A craftsperson's movements embody both measurement and sensing - they're not separate activities but aspects of one integrated way of knowing.\nThis shows us how metrics and meaning can work together:\n\nQuality emerges from careful attention\nMeasurement serves beauty\nForm enables rather than constrains\nTradition guides innovation\n\nSmooth is Fast: The Paradox of Pace\nPerhaps most importantly, craft teaches us about timing. Like the cook who breaks the jar by rushing, we often create delays through forced speed. But when we trust quality recognition:\n\nNatural rhythm emerges\nRight action becomes clear\nOthers align naturally\nResources flow appropriately\n\nThis isn't slow for slowness' sake. It's what athletes call \"smooth is fast\" - the paradoxical efficiency that comes from aligned action rather than forced effort.\nImplications for Social Impact\nThis suggests a different approach to social enterprise:\n\nCreate conditions rather than force outcomes\nBuild capacity through relationship\nLet quality guide growth\nTrust natural timing\n\nWhen we do this:\n\nImpact emerges naturally\nCommunities build resilience\nResources align with needs\nBeauty spreads organically\n\nThe key is seeing that, like gardens and craft, social impact isn't something we make happen through force. It's something we participate in through wise attention and aligned action.\nPart IV: Practical Implications for Bloom - From Platform to Practice\nRethinking Our Foundation\nThe most profound implication of this shift in thinking requires us to challenge our core assumption: that software is our path to scale and sustainability. In an age where AI and new technologies are rapidly transforming digital tools, we need to ask ourselves a more fundamental question: What is our true craft?\nWhat We Really Offer\nThe evidence of our value is clear but misunderstood:\n\nPeople love our programs\nTransformation happens consistently\nDeep connections form\nReal growth emerges\n\nYet we've been trying to capture this in software, attempting to scale what might not be meant for scaling. Instead, we need to:\n\nFocus on our genuine craft\nLet value guide structure\nAllow natural growth\nTrust quality recognition\n\nA New Model for Our Work\nFor Entrepreneurs\nInstead of pushing platform engagement, we create conditions where they:\n\nFeel truly seen and connected\nDevelop self-knowledge and confidence\nLearn to trust their quality recognition\nAccess genuine wisdom\nFind natural resources and support\n\nFor Our Team\nWe shift from monitoring to nurturing:\n\nCultivating circumstances for growth\nFinding and connecting with true mentors\nEnsuring principles are embodied not just understood\nUsing metrics to reflect rather than direct\nStarting with territory before consulting maps\n\nFor Partners\nRelationships deepen naturally:\n\nIntegration with meaning\nAuthentic value creation\nReality-based assessment\nNatural resource flow\n\nThe Path Forward\nSpecific Changes Required:\n\nProgram Focus: Start with direct relationship; Let technology support not lead; Measure after, not during; Build from real value\nBusiness Model: Simple, clear value proposition; Direct payment for real service; Natural growth from quality; Sustainable core practice\nAssessment Approach: Quality recognition first; Metrics for reflection; Natural feedback loops; Organic development\n\nPractical Experiments\nCome Alive Coaching\n\nStart with pro bono trials\nPartner with professional coaches\nDocument real transformation\nBuild from genuine results\n\nCore Practice Development\n\nIdentify our true craft\nFocus on direct value\nLet natural scale emerge\nTrust quality recognition\n\nRelationship Restructuring\n\nDirect connection with participants\nValue-based funding relationships\nCommunity of practice\nNatural growth patterns\n\nThe Technology Question\nInstead of forcing platform adoption, technology should:\n\nSupport human connection\nEnable natural processes\nDocument real value\nScale what works naturally\n\nThis means:\n\nSimpler tools\nDirect support of practice\nNatural integration\nOrganic growth\n\nMeasuring Success Differently\nSuccess looks like:\n\nReal transformation in participants\nSustainable value creation\nNatural resource flow\nCommunity growth\nQuality recognition development\n\nThis isn't abandoning scale but trusting that:\n\nQuality creates natural growth\nValue attracts resources\nBeauty spreads organically\nWisdom develops naturally\n\nThe key is starting with what's real and valuable, letting genuine craft guide our development rather than forcing growth through artificial means.\nPart V: The Path Forward - From Where We Are to Where We're Called\nBuilding from Strength\nLooking clearly at our work, we already have powerful elements aligned with this vision:\nWhat's Working:\n\nLearning Journeys: Custom assessment approach; Personal challenge identification; Individual growth paths\nCore Practices: Upside-down pyramid methodology; Starting with deeper why; Focus on wellbeing; Breaking out for connection; Relationship building\nCommunity Elements: Cohort connections; Mentor relationships; Peer learning; Reflective practice\n\nNecessary Shifts\nFrom Software-First to Human-First:\n\nTechnology supports don't leads\nCommunity precedes platform\nRelationship drives development\nReflection guides action\n\nFrom Metrics to Meaning:\n\nRemove \"habits of success\" language\nShift from goals to emergence\nTransform assessment approach\nStart with territory, end with maps\n\nFrom Programs to Practice:\n\nCoaching as core offering\nDeep relationship building\nMaster-apprentice model\nNatural development paths\n\nPractical Next Steps\nImmediate Actions (1-3 months):\n\nLaunch pilot coaching program\nClean language/materials\nDocument current successes\nStart stakeholder conversations\n\nMedium Term (3-6 months):\n\nValidate \"Come Alive\" methodology\nDevelop new funding relationships\nCreate craft-based accelerator model\nBuild natural assessment approach\n\nLong Term Vision:\n\nBecome transmission line for wisdom\nCreate conditions for emergence\nEnable natural scale through quality\nBuild true mastery\n\nStakeholder Engagement\nFinding Aligned Partners:\n\nFoundations focused on practical spirituality\nFunders seeking systemic change\nPartners valuing depth over scale\nCommunities supporting transformation\n\nDemonstrating Value:\n\nShare success stories\nShow alternative models working\nDocument real transformation\nBuild evidence through practice\n\nCreating New Narratives:\n\nFrom scale to depth\nFrom metrics to meaning\nFrom control to emergence\nFrom programs to practice\n\nMeasures of Success\nIn 6 months we should see:\nValidated Methodology\n\nTested coaching approach\nClear value proposition\nNatural payment model\nDirect impact evidence\n\nTransformed Relationships\n\nDeeper mentor connections\nStronger community bonds\nAligned funding partners\nClear transmission lines\n\nNew Offerings\n\nCraft-based accelerator\nIntegrated technology support\nQuality-centered assessment\nNatural growth patterns\n\nThe Super Bloom Vision\nInstead of forcing growth, we cultivate conditions where:\n\nBeauty emerges naturally\nWisdom transfers clearly\nCommunity builds organically\nImpact flows naturally\n\nThis isn't slower - it's aligned with natural timing. Not smaller - but scaled through quality. Not less impactful - but transformative at the root.\nThe key is trusting that when we align with quality:\n\nRight relationships form\nResources flow naturally\nImpact emerges organically\nBeauty spreads naturally\n\nOur role becomes:\n\nCreating conditions\nSupporting emergence\nEnabling transmission\nTrusting quality\n\nThis is how we contribute to the super bloom - not by forcing growth but by planting seeds in fertile soil, tending with wisdom, and trusting the natural unfolding of beauty and impact.\nThree final questions:\n\nHow can we most effectively communicate this vision in a way that inspires stakeholders while addressing legitimate concerns around scale, evidence, and feasibility?\nWhat specific practices can we implement immediately to start embodying these principles in our day-to-day work, even before making larger structural changes?\nHow will we know we're on the right track? What signs of natural growth and alignment should we look for to validate that this approach is working?\n\nOverall, I believe this essay presents a compelling case for a fundamental shift in how we understand and pursue social impact. It grounds this vision in lived experience, offers concrete models and practices, and charts a path from current reality to future possibility.\nThe key will be translating these insights into aligned action - not as a new dogma but as an ongoing practice of wise participation. By staying true to what we already know, while daring to trust the deeper wisdom of quality, beauty, and natural unfolding, we can pioneer a new paradigm for social change."

            "extracted_content": "From Metrics to Meaning: Why Our Worldview Matters More Than Our Numbers\n“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”\n—Albert Einstein\n\nI. Introduction: The Crisis of “Doing Good”\nIn the modern “changemaker” scene—social enterprises, NGOs, philanthropic initiatives—there’s a mounting unease. On the surface, impact metrics, corporate-style scaling strategies, and ROI dashboards promise efficiency and accountability. Yet many of us are left feeling that something is off. As one social entrepreneur observed, “We can meet all the SDGs and still hate our lives.”\n\nWhy is this? The tension arises because, in trying to “do good,” we often adopt the same extractive, competitive, and disconnected logic that fueled the problems we’re trying to solve. We measure success by numbers alone, chase quick wins, and treat humans as data points. Meanwhile, the deeper sources of meaning—our capacity for relationship, beauty, truth, and what truly makes us come alive—are dismissed as intangible or “woo-woo.”\n\nYet across cultures, we find reminders that how we do things inevitably shapes what we create. As the Caribbean saying goes, “If you cut corners, you’ll build a round house.” Or in Chinese wisdom, “The water takes the shape of the vessel it fills.” If the “vessel” is a mindset of acceleration, extraction, and superficial metrics, our “impact” outcomes will reflect those qualities—no matter how noble our intentions.\n\nThis essay explores why the worldview behind our actions matters more than any well-intentioned façade of doing good. We will look at:\n\nReal-World Cases: Social enterprises and NGOs adopting corporate practices with harmful consequences.\nMetaphors from Multiple Cultures: Why superficial fixes fail when the deeper logic remains unchanged.\nCraft, Gardens, and Slow Approaches: Alternative models (like Shinola or Arlan’s Boat Works) that focus on quality, relationship, and presence.\nPractical Shifts: How to realign from “metrics mania” to meaningful, human-centered ways of working.\nII. Doing Good Gone Wrong: How a Corporate Mindset Distorts Social Mission\n“You cannot wash blood with blood.”\n—(Indian Proverb)\nMeaning: Using the same destructive mindset that caused the problem will not heal it.\n\nNumerous organizations begin with genuine aims—providing relief, protecting the planet, empowering the vulnerable—yet adopt the same mechanistic worldview prevalent in corporate arenas. The results often backfire.\n\n1. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)\nWhat Happened: Microfinance originally aimed to uplift marginalized communities through small loans, especially to women entrepreneurs. But as MFIs expanded, they embraced profit-maximizing goals, aggressive repayment targets, and loan quotas. This devolved into coercive practices, high interest rates, and even borrower suicides (e.g., in parts of India).\nKey Lesson: A purely corporate growth mindset, obsessed with repayment metrics, compromised the deeper purpose of alleviating poverty. “You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear,” goes an English proverb—high-quality social uplift can’t emerge from low-quality methods rooted in extraction.\n2. Charity: “Efficiency” in Disaster Relief\nWhat Happened: After Haiti’s 2010 earthquake, large NGOs chased donor satisfaction and visible “completion metrics” (houses built, roads paved). In reality, poorly planned infrastructure neither lasted nor respected local wisdom. Billions of dollars were spent inefficiently, guided by ROI mania rather than resilient community-building.\nKey Lesson: “If you cut corners, you’ll build a round house.” Rushing to please donors erodes the long-term relationships and robust planning needed to foster genuine recovery.\n3. Fair Trade’s “Certification Industrial Complex”\nWhat Happened: Fair Trade began to secure just prices for small-scale farmers. Over time, formal certification processes ballooned, catering to big plantations with minimal real oversight. Small farmers found themselves edged out or unable to afford certification fees, thus reinforcing inequality.\nKey Lesson: “If the root is rotten, the fruit cannot be sweet.” (Chinese proverb). Even if a brand’s packaging displays “Fair Trade,” the underlying system can remain exploitative if scaled using purely corporate logic.\n4. Nonprofit “Professionalization” and Burnout\nWhat Happened: Many nonprofits implement corporate-style hierarchies, productivity metrics, and performance evaluations to appear “serious” to funders. This spawns burnout, high turnover, and mission drift, as staff feel they’re just cogs in a machine—no different from exploitative business cultures. Oxfam and Save the Children faced scandals involving toxic environments and ignoring staff well-being.\nKey Lesson: “A rotten fish spoils the whole pot.” (Indian proverb). Importing hierarchical, efficiency-obsessed practices kills morale and authenticity in missions founded on care and empathy.\n5. Education Startups and “Datafication”\nWhat Happened: EdTech ventures often prioritize standardized test scores, data analytics, and “scalable” models. Programs meant to empower students end up reinforcing rigid metrics and control, overlooking local contexts or teacher expertise. Bridge International Academies was criticized for scripted lessons that disempowered teachers.\nKey Lesson: “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” (English saying). Even well-meant data-driven solutions can flatten the rich complexities of learning, turning students into numbers rather than nurturing their holistic growth.\nExtended Examples: More “Doing Good Gone Wrong”\nFast Fashion’s “Conscious Collections”: A tiny fraction of production labeled “sustainable” while the core model remains exploitative, driving overconsumption.\nVolunteer Tourism (“Voluntourism”): Feel-good experiences for visitors overshadow truly sustainable community involvement.\nCarbon Offsetting Programs: Planting trees to “offset” continuing emissions ends up greenwashing root problems of overproduction.\nPrivatization of Public Services: When essential services like water or healthcare become for-profit ventures, inequality often deepens rather than resolving.\nAcross these cases, the underlying flaw is a neoliberal logic of extraction, speed, and seeing people as instruments—“Wearing a new mask on the same face,” so to speak. Or in other metaphors:\n\n“Pouring Clean Water into a Dirty Cup”: Good intentions poured into a toxic system remain compromised.\n“Trying to Grow Organic Food in Polluted Soil”: A philanthropic or social enterprise effort inherits the toxins of competition and profit-maximization if it doesn’t question them.\n“Teaching Wolves to Herd Sheep”: Corporate growth mindsets conflict at a core level with relational or community-based interventions.\nIII. Why the Same Mindset Replicates the Same Problems\n“The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.”\n—Audre Lorde\n\nThis quote captures the heart of the issue: adopting the conventional corporate toolbox for social impact typically reproduces competition, hierarchical control, and acceleration. It may deliver short-term outputs, but it rarely fosters deep transformation.\n\nAs an African proverb reminds us:\n\n“The spirit in which you give is more important than the gift itself.”\n\nIf the spirit is one of “check the donor’s box” or “scale at all costs,” the results, no matter how well-packaged, come tainted by that underlying orientation.\n\nInevitable Outcomes of a Corporate Worldview\nDisconnection: People and ecosystems become abstract “beneficiaries” or “resources,” severing authentic relationships.\nExtraction: Metrics revolve around deliverables, ignoring intangible well-being, local knowledge, or cultural context.\nAcceleration: Urgency and quick fixes overshadow the slow, patient building of trust and community-led solutions.\nIn short, “You can’t grow flowers in poisoned soil.” Unless the soil (the worldview) is healed, seeds of social good can’t thrive.\n\nIV. Alternative Path: From Extraction to Quality and Relationship\n“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”\n—Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMoving beyond mechanistic approaches demands a fundamental shift: from forcing growth and manipulating metrics to attending to genuine quality in every action. This calls for slowing down, building relationships, and trusting a deeper faculty of direct perception—one that recognizes beauty, meaning, and authenticity without immediate quantification.\n\nA. The Faculty of Direct Perception\nMany of us have a quiet sense of what “feels right”: an internal compass that distinguishes meaningful engagement from token gestures. Yet we’ve been taught to ignore or belittle this intuition as “unscientific” or “too emotional.”\n\nExample: Shinola in Detroit banked on local pride and skilled craftsmanship to rebuild a watchmaking tradition. The intangible factor—restoring dignity—was no less important than the bottom line.\nExample: Father Greg Boyle’s Homeboy Industries thrives on friendship, not just “data-driven recidivism metrics,” revealing how relationships can supersede conventional accountability tools.\nWhen measurement serves meaning, rather than dictating it, we nurture outcomes far richer than any standard KPI.\n\nB. Models for Slower, Deeper Engagement\nGardening vs. Factories\n\nFactory Mindset: Standardize, control, push throughput.\nGardener Mindset: Prepare the soil, plant seeds, tend patiently, and let nature’s rhythms lead.\nIn social impact, a gardener invests time to understand community needs, fosters local leadership, and remains flexible, allowing emergence instead of forcing compliance.\nCraft, Apprenticeship, and Mastery\n\nArlan’s Boat Works (Maine): Wooden boat building relies on measuring wood precisely and feeling it in your hands—an interplay of logic and intuition. Apprentices learn by closely observing and emulating masters.\nThe “Smooth is Fast” Principle: Slowing down to ensure quality often leads to fewer mistakes, richer relationships, and ironically, more sustainable progress.\nLocal Partnership and Co-Creation\n\nInstead of imposing top-down solutions, co-design interventions with communities.\nExample: Genuine microfinance (before it got corrupted) hinged on relationship-based lending circles, personal trust, and deep local knowledge.\nV. Concrete Shifts: From Superficial Metrics to Meaningful Action\n“How we walk the path shapes where it leads.”\n\nIt’s not enough to critique. We need workable alternatives that respect our need for some data while prioritizing the intangible yet vital aspects of trust, presence, and quality.\n\nRedefine Success Beyond Numbers\n\nIntegrate “well-being indexes,” “meaningful moments,” or “relationship depth” into your organization’s goals.\nExample: “Meaningful Moments per Month per Employee” can replace or complement “hours clocked” or “units produced.”\nShift from Efficiency to Relationship\n\nEfficiency has its place in mundane tasks, but deep social change hinges on relationships.\n“The water takes the shape of the vessel it fills.” (Chinese proverb). If your vessel is purely efficiency-driven, you risk dehumanizing the process of change.\nBuild Time for Reflection and Presence\n\nLike an athlete practicing “smooth is fast,” give space for weekly check-ins or “presence circles.”\nEncourage staff and beneficiaries alike to name tensions, celebrate small wins, and question why certain tasks feel “off.”\nSlow, Context-Specific Scaling\n\nIf you must scale, do it organically. Demand-driven expansions keep the focus on local realities and relationships.\nAvoid “one-size-fits-all” replication. Each new region or community might need a fresh, patient approach.\nHonor the Faculty of Direct Perception\n\nTeach teams to trust qualitative signals— discomfort, resonance, the “aha” of alignment. These are data too, just not numerical.\n“You cannot use fire to put out fire.” (Buddhist teaching). We can’t fix the emotional and relational vacuum by doubling down on spreadsheets.\nVI. Counterexamples & Hope: When Quality Leads to Thriving\nAmid grim stories of microfinance abuses and fair trade distortions, there are shining cases where organizations aligned means and ends more holistically:\n\nShinola (Detroit): Built watchmaking skills locally, paying living wages. The pride of craftsmanship and economic uplift advanced together.\nArlan’s Boat Works: Apprenticeships link tradition, care, and skill. Boats become more than objects; they are tangible evidence of shared mastery.\nFather Greg Boyle’s Homeboy Industries: Prioritizing “they’re my friends” fosters a genuine relational approach—metrics follow, but friendship leads.\nLocal, Indigenous-Led Conservation Efforts: In many parts of the world, indigenous communities manage forests or fisheries sustainably, guided by cultural values that see nature as kin, not a resource.\nWhat unites these examples? A commitment to authenticity, a willingness to slow down, and an embrace of both intangible and tangible dimensions of work. They measure, yes, but with a light touch—serving deeper human or ecological flourishing.\n\nVII. Pulling It All Together: A Worldview Shift\n“The way you make your bed is the way you will sleep.”\n—(African Proverb)\n\nWhen we chase purely corporate metrics or try to “upgrade the chains of a prison” by adding an “ethical veneer” to the same old machinery, we replicate disconnection, extraction, and acceleration. Transformational change demands we question the deeper logic—embracing a worldview of relationship, trust, and quality as fundamental.\n\nA. Embrace the Process as Much as the Outcome\n“One cannot plant weeds and hope for wheat.” (Middle Eastern proverb). If our daily methods are shallow or exploitative, the final product can’t miraculously become ethical.\n“Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” (Mahatma Gandhi). Our internal alignment shapes external impact.\nB. Recognize that Worldviews Are Contagious\nIf you measure everything in “returns,” your partners, employees, and even beneficiaries start seeing themselves as means to an end.\nIf you approach from a place of trust, respect, and presence, you create a culture that values people as people. Over time, that culture yields far-reaching resilience and prosperity.\nC. Allow Time for Emergence\n“Trying to grow organic food in polluted soil” fails because we don’t let the land heal. Similarly, social impact demands letting new models gestate in fresh soil—free from the toxins of constant “scaling” pressure.\nReal change often looks messy or slow at first. But as Shinola and Arlan’s Boat Works show, the craft approach—focusing on depth—creates outcomes that endure.\nVIII. Conclusion: Choosing a Different Path\n“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”\n—Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWe’ve seen how so-called “good intentions” can implode under the weight of a worldview that values speed, competition, and metrics above all else. We’ve glimpsed alternatives—gardener mindsets, craft approaches, local partnership, direct perception—that honor human dignity and ecological balance from the start.\n\nIf the foundation is flawed, no amount of superficial patching will fix it. Or as a Turkish proverb warns, “The pot leaks from where it was poorly sealed.” To truly “seal the pot,” we must reimagine why and how we work, moving from mechanical checklists to living relationships.\n\n“We can meet all the SDGs and still hate our lives.”\nWhen the underlying worldview remains extractive, even well-funded accomplishments can leave us spiritually bankrupt.\n\nBut with a shift to meaning-first, measurement-second, we may find that the intangible—trust, presence, authenticity—becomes our most reliable guide. And paradoxically, when we honor this deeper sense of quality, the quantitative results (financial stability, genuine social impact, ecological restoration) often flourish in ways we could never force with metrics alone.\n\nA Final Invitation\nTry one small experiment:\n\nThe next time you plan a project or hold a team meeting, notice whether the group’s default is “get numbers quickly” or “listen for what’s truly alive in the situation.”\nMake space for a “presence circle,” inviting each person to name one tension and one aspiration. See if a more relational, qualitative understanding emerges.\nThen decide which metrics might support that insight rather than replace it.\nThis shift won’t be instant. We’re all shaped by systems that prize speed and quantification. Yet, as the Chinese proverb reminds us, “As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.” Each choice to bend the twig toward authenticity and depth helps us grow organizations—and societies—that embody the world we wish to see.\n\nKey Takeaways in Brief\nWorldview Is Crucial\n\n“Better maps don’t help if you’re heading in the wrong direction.” A toxic system cannot be fixed by more “efficient” metrics alone.\nDoing Good Goes Wrong When…\n\nWe adopt neoliberal/corporate logic (extraction, disconnection, acceleration) under the banner of “impact.”\nMetaphors to Remember\n\n“Pouring clean water into a dirty cup”\n“Upgrading the chains of a prison”\n“Teaching wolves to herd sheep”\nAlternatives Exist\n\nShinola’s craftsmanship, Arlan’s Boat Works, Homeboy Industries, and countless local/regenerative models show that relational, craft-oriented approaches yield deeper, more lasting impact.\nPractical Shifts\n\nRedefine success: from raw numbers to relationship-based, holistic indicators.\nSlow down for reflection: “smooth is fast.”\nHonor direct perception: intangible signals of alignment matter.\nFinal Quote\n\n“We cannot use fire to put out fire.” (Buddhist Teaching)\nIf the fundamental mindset is broken, we must move beyond it—toward an approach that values quality, trust, and genuine human presence as core principles of our shared future.\nIn closing\nLet us recognize that how we walk the path not only shapes where we end up, but who we become in the process. By reclaiming a slower, relational worldview—one that measures meaning before metrics—we stand a far better chance of nurturing real human flourishing, inside our organizations and across the world."

              "content": "# From Metrics to Meaning: A New Vision for Bloom\n\n## Comparative Analysis and Integration Strategy\n\nThe two source essays share core themes but approach them differently:\n\nEssay 1 (\"From Metrics to Meaning: A New Vision for Social Impact\") focuses on personal experience and organizational transformation, using specific examples from Bloom's journey. It emphasizes the shift from platform-based scaling to quality-centered growth.\n\nEssay 2 (\"From Metrics to Meaning: Why Our Worldview Matters\") provides a broader critique of the social impact sector, using diverse cultural metaphors and case studies to illustrate how corporate mindsets can corrupt good intentions.\n\nYour additional perspective brings in crucial elements:\n- The faculty of perception as a reliable guide\n- The confusion between emotions and deep knowing\n- The connection between worldview and action\n- The craft approach as a living example\n\nI propose integrating these into a new structure that:\n1. Opens with personal experience (from Essay 1)\n2. Expands to systemic critique (from Essay 2)\n3. Offers a new vision incorporating your added perspective\n4. Concludes with practical implications for Bloom\n\n## The Combined Essay\n\n### Part I: The Moment Everything Changed\n\n_In Dubai, watching entrepreneurs share their stories during our retreat, something shifted. As tears flowed and hearts opened, I witnessed something our carefully designed metrics and platforms could never capture: the pure beauty of people fully aligned with their calling._\n\nThis moment revealed a truth that's been haunting our sector: we can meet all our carefully crafted metrics and still feel fundamentally disconnected from what matters. The tension I felt when speaking about Bloom on Al Jazeera wasn't just about inadequate measurement – it was about a deeper misalignment in how we see our work and the world.\n\n### Part II: The Root of Our Disconnect\n\nWe've inherited a worldview that fundamentally mistrusts humans. From Darwin's \"survival of the fittest\" to Hobbes's \"nasty, brutish, and short,\" we've built systems based on control rather than emergence. This shows up in how we:\n\n- Treat people as means to ends rather than ends in themselves\n- Value speed over depth\n- Chase metrics that don't capture what matters\n- Force growth instead of allowing natural development\n\nThe microfinance crisis illustrates this perfectly: organizations founded to lift people from poverty ended up driving some to suicide because they prioritized collection rates over human wellbeing. The means corrupted the ends.\n\n### Part III: A Different Way of Seeing\n\nWhat if we have a reliable faculty for perceiving quality, beauty, and truth? Not emotional reaction, but direct recognition of what's real and valuable? This isn't mystical – it's practical wisdom demonstrated by:\n\n- Master craftspeople who integrate measurement and meaning\n- Gardeners who understand natural timing\n- Communities that build resilience through relationship\n- Leaders like Father Greg Boyle who say simply: \"They're my friends\"\n\nThe confusion between emotional reaction and this deeper faculty of perception has led us astray. When we feel that sliminess of inauthenticity or the tension of forced metrics, we're receiving valuable information – not about our emotions, but about reality itself.\n\n### Part IV: Quality as Guide\n\nQuality isn't just about good work – it's about right relationship with reality. When we align with quality:\n\n- Action flows naturally from recognition\n- Metrics serve beauty rather than control\n- Growth emerges organically\n- Resources align naturally\n- Communities build resilience\n\nThis isn't slower – it's aligned with natural timing. Not smaller – but scaled through quality. Not less impactful – but transformative at the root.\n\n### Part V: Implications for Bloom\n\nThis suggests a fundamental shift in how we support social enterprises:\n\n1. From Platform to Practice\n- Start with direct relationship\n- Let technology support, not lead\n- Build from real value\n- Trust quality recognition\n\n2. From Programs to Craft\n- Focus on mastery development\n- Enable natural emergence\n- Support deep practice\n- Build real relationships\n\n3. From Metrics to Meaning\n- Measure what matters\n- Let quality guide growth\n- Enable natural feedback\n- Trust development\n\n### Conclusion: The Path Forward\n\nInstead of forcing growth through artificial means, we create conditions where:\n- Beauty emerges naturally\n- Wisdom transfers clearly\n- Community builds organically\n- Impact flows naturally\n\nThis isn't abandoning our mission – it's fulfilling it more deeply. Not giving up on scale – but achieving it through quality. Not sacrificing impact – but ensuring it touches root causes.\n\nBy aligning with quality and trusting our faculty of direct perception, we can pioneer a new paradigm for social change. One that doesn't just do good, but embodies it in every action.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps for Discussion:\n\n1. How do we transition our current programs?\n2. What metrics truly serve our deeper purpose?\n3. How do we communicate this vision to stakeholders?\n4. What practices help us embody these principles daily?\n\nLet's explore these questions together, not as problems to solve, but as invitations to deeper alignment with what we know matters most.",

            "extracted_content": "  I'd like first to compare and contrast the two essays trying to convince my cofounders of my focus on quality as a primary shift in perspective that addresses the issue in social impact being instrumental, and not changing things at a root level because it is not realizing it's operating in a system (investors, human resources, world resources, impact, acceleration, speed, challenge, solution) that it can't see and reinforcing it, underlining it, making it stick and sticky rather than bringing in ways to solve problems and create value and sustain life that work with different fundamental worldviews, ontologies and epistemologies, that we have a faculty of perception of beauty goodness and truth that is reliable and trustworthy as a guide, that this sense is accessible yet often covered by emotions, that the confusion between \"irrational\" emotions and the reality of the deep sense of rightness that comes when we touch our sources of meaning has blocked us from acknowledging this faculty, that not touching this faculty has led us to not trust humans, and believe that they are living nasty brutish and short lives and that darwin's perspective of survival of the fittest is right and those that produce the most benefit for the most number deserve the most to be rewarded and to live (potentially forever) - a natural consequence of these unseen underlying beliefs about the metaphysical cosmological understanding of our world while we have great examples of people choosing to follow a different path, the path of the heart, you might say, like sounds true, and others described int he document above, noe that connects with quality, the reason for doing thigns rather than the result, for instance we see micro lending suicides where those reaching out and hounding the poor farmers with 100 dollar loans saw them as a means to an end \"getting their paycheck or comission\" and reaching \"closing rates\" vs realizing the fundamental point of micro credit was to bring people out of poverty and suffering - not to cause it. That with touching this source of quality we see people who understand how they do anything is how they do everything and to sink into the quality of the work becoming crafts people where action and measurement and production all touch in a moment of now rather than a goal in the future to sell what's made, to speed up the process, to get it done with because money is freedom. Freedom is having a life you want to live, a life where you've come alive. And if we look at the broaden and build theory, we can see that its' clear when we come alive, we expand our capacity, our ability to serve, oru wellbeing, we become reliable people, the next masters able to take on apprentences... Review all this content and identify the differences between the two essays, the stories that apply where and integrate this section I've just written throught the newly combined essay, write about how you'd like to go about doing it and write the new essay  \nCurrent letter to Munir and Dara, my cofounders at Bloom.pm a social impact accelerator and social enterprise support ecosystem: [[[\nI’m writing to show you why I believe our systems emerge from our foundational beliefs and mindsets—about what the world is and what humans are. Like a dog that won't cross an electric fence, we are limited by our deepest assumptions, many of which are historically ingrained. The problem is that we have lost a way of relating to the world that honors quality and meaning over mere materiality, and I want to show you why reconnecting with that sense of depth helps us truly come alive. By coming alive and reconnecting with this lost way of seeing, we can build new kinds of systems that honor people as ends in themselves, not just means for achieving “impact,” “funding,” or “goals.”\nBelow, I’m going to walk you through:\nWhy emergent approaches matter more than rigid systems\nWhy our present mindset of “winners take all” and mastery is flawed\nHow honoring relationships, depth, and meaning (vs. breadth and metrics) can heal burnout\nWhy I think we can form a better foundation for Bloom.pm by coming alive first, then building systems\nI’ll share the personal reflections, doubts, and inspirations that led me here. Then, I’ll remind you, in the end, what I told you.\n\nTell Them\nCore Hypothesis: Systems Emerge From Our Foundational Beliefs\nThe suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the master's house with the master's tools are becoming clearer and clearer to me. I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people as ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. It's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror. Honor and dignity are worth more than continued funding from donors who don't trust us to treat us well.\nI am convinced that we need emergent approaches—good people and trust that they will do beautiful things—not good systems we attempt to shape people through. We are kind of limited by our foundational beliefs and understandings. Historically, these beliefs have led us to live in a way that is instrumental and transactional. We lost a different way we once had of seeing the world—one related to quality, to a sense of meaning, not just materiality.\n\nWhy Emergent Approaches Over Rigid Systems?\nEven the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care and our connection are essential. We need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful—a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. There's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage instead of leaning into the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality. We need to see them with the eye of quality—the eye of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty—the eye that knows these things.\n\nCritique of the “Winners Take All” Mindset\nDeveloping skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something. What if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and access what their hearts are calling them towards?\nWhat if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out, rather than pushing funding, expenditures, and movement that may be adding friction and doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone? With so much friction, we can certainly burn people out, as we've seen on our own teams. What are we really doing?\n\nRelationships, Depth, and Healing Burnout\nThen, we can have scalable systems where those people can impact others, rather than thinking about scale in breadth—showing how many people have jobs or planted trees. We need to get more comfortable with depth: how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude, making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change versus one which has \"good impact.\" Impact—the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor or an asteroid on the earth—reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days; things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing.\nWhy do we talk about wellbeing and stress? What if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, and built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community? We can move fast later when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, and I know you worry about the business failing, and that's okay. I sort of think that business might need to go.\n\nFoundational Beliefs and Historical Context\nI don't know if you believe, as I do, that good things live and true things find their homes. If we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and truly focus on the problem that moves us and what brings us to life sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood,\" I think we'll find something. It might be small—who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while—although I don't think that's so bad.\nWhat if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\"? Perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things—perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what I've been doing.\n\nPersonal Reflections: Coming Alive\nI've been thinking about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. The ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most effective\"—it's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate. Initially, I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things—that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance.\nExternally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley, and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me. If you think about it, you will use your will to compel your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal. Your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, and why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors who believe that the ends justify the means?\n\nRelationality, Love, and Meaning as Ends\nIt's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when I was younger, inspired by Father Greg Boyle. When they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, and care—these are all ends, reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not perceived by the eye of rationality. They are perceived by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, and what beauty is. That eye is the one that I would like to cultivate.\nThe Nietzsche quote, \"He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how,\" guides me here. People who love have climbed mountains—\"there ain't no mountain high enough,\" \"there ain't no ocean vast enough\"—to keep them away from the beauty they want to do. This is a real reason, a source of persistence, vitality, and passion to knock on a thousand doors until one opens. This is why they'll leave our heart-based aliveness-focused program and join Y Combinator to get what they need financially or figure something totally new and unexpected out.\nI'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, the upside-down pyramid, starting with why, character strengths, and coming alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness-based stress reduction for people to better manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. It's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct? What about that is meaningful for us that's being lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echoes within you. Those emotions are treasures, and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra.\n\nEmotions as Messengers of Meaning\nEach tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist, and sink into what we're doing without being attached. Contentedness is not an emotion; it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing things and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small, bold actions. Similar to the zone described by the flow state, where our skills are at the edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at, we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of calls.\n\nWhere the Current System Falls Short\nThis means trust, implies process, and moves people, businesses, projects, and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive, organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future, and planned. It's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise. It's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). We saw how let down the people who can see this hypocrisy felt. It's so true though—the goals, the SDGs, the plans—these things are dead on arrival. The reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on the attainment of something.\nI know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact, I'm confident that since you've known me long enough, you might accept it a bit more. Yet for me, it took a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with Aristotle and the idea of classification. Aristotle’s metaphysics focus on cause-and-effect relationships (final cause, material cause) percolate like water through the grounds of Western culture and get amplified by the mechanistic thinking of the Scientific Revolution (Descartes, Newton). It's just a brain watching a world of parts interact—sort of system thinking, Hobbes. Oh crap, Christians are killing each other; we're totally horrible, and we need a rational government to put things in order. Systems should be what we follow, not people. Enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, laden with democratic American ideas like \"let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion,\" etc.\n\nHistorical Roots and a Lost Way of Seeing\nWe live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause-effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that Galileo said is the perfect way to describe the world. It can all be displayed as a nice little infographic—the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of consciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria, and we go fix that because death is bad. What about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear-based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about or understand the impact of the history of ideas) had?\nWe're here because of someone else's war, freaking people out. Our systems destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans. If there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to achieve goals more efficiently, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes? Who cares if we breed them to be transported across the ocean and have no idea what that does to the flavor, let alone nutritional profile?\n\nIt’s About Our Way of Seeing, Not Just Different Goals\nWe must use these fear-based epistemologies and ontologies that see the world full of nasty, brutish people who will die shortly unless we use our reason to align with the reason of the natural world, to break it up into little pieces and use it to our favor. And BTW, the people who think like this are more likely to be skiing in the Alps and owning businesses than running them. Also, their kids don't go to public schools and get graded like screws and meat of varying quality. By the way, I'm more of a B/B+ sort of person than a Grade A, so here, doing this thinking is a bit out of my weight class. Yet I digress, and I try anyway to help you see, feel, and understand this foundational thing.\nIt's NOT about the wrong goals, profit or SDGs. It's not even about the systems leveraging personal and professional growth to help transform the economic system into one that's better for people and the planet. No, it's about the way of seeing and understanding what a person is, what the world is, and the systems that emerge from that understanding.\n\nReconnecting With Meaning for New Systems to Emerge\nOur neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is hard to argue with. Market efficiency sort of works, as does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core. We can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy, resources, and food—all commodities—which the markets manage, valuing perfectly well. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy-sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short-sighted efficiency of materiality.\nI've tried not to say God in this run-on paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of Instagram, a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country—little pinballs bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love? That's some oxytocin and some serotonin floating around a bloodstream in a body that wants to keep its bodily integrity intact so that it can propagate itself and not die. You cannot learn Darwin's theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty—don't you know? There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this; you may have even felt this if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost.\nThese things have been bugging me for a long time. I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children—full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post-WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it at our own expense. Sure, this is all fine, said typing on a MacBook Pro made by a capitalist company with $216 billion in cash reserves, benefiting from the international trade that brings me coffee from Ethiopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe.\nYet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness are and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that—a little each day. Weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet somehow I think that goes against my point here. We need to see each other, even our messy selves. This is from my heart to yours. I'm writing this with you, Dara, and you, Munir, in mind.\nIt's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey—where I've felt off, yet I acquiesced, allowing my doubt in my own feelings to fester. I thought maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do—the upside-down pyramid, self-efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, one-on-ones, the 1% better journey were about that. Goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, but they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon; become a runner. We've talked about these.\nYet more foundationally, this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on: we should measure at the end of the day and attend to our sources of meaning at the start. The story of self and the story of the world can and must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to see, echo, resonate with, and inspire knowledge and action. Togetherness matters, being a mirror matters, finding emotions is precious, discerning between emotions and states matters, goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice. We can go slow, be gentle with ourselves, and be successful once we start on the path to self-knowledge and alignment with values, perception, and enaction.\nI think sometimes you must think that I'm crazy, and perhaps I am. Although I'm working on developing my ideas, gathering stories (microfinance was beautiful, right? Amu Yunus got a Nobel Prize, cool? Well, we're seeing the fruits of not foundationally changing the perception of what finance is, what money is, what it serves. What a human is with a spate of suicides as a result of not being able to pay the petty sum back and being hounded by people who are achieving \"targets\"—targets, pretty grim).\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no, it's not only because we don't have money for paid holidays; there's something burning about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions—we must treat people as ends and get close. Relationships matter, commitment matters, connection matters. Scale can happen in a beautiful and authentic way, probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again.\nI sometimes think perhaps I've been saved from success because I'm not sure I would have had the time, perspective, and frustration, quite frankly, to see as I do. Am I just \"sourgraping\" this whole thing? I don't think so. I think indigenous economics—talking about cyclical time (not linear) thinking, seven generations (not retiring when I'm 40), relationships with a world of meaning (not humans and nature as resources to extract)—are similar. Yet indigenous economics stays small and sort of implies we must take their principles and ways of doing things rather than discovering them ourselves in our own indigeneity—our Lebanese indigenous economics—emerging from systems built by people who have reintegrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic and the eyes of meaning and quality. Being confident enough to know we need to be wary of too much planning in an era of collapse. We need to live in a way that when the bombs drop or the seas start rising, we are confident we did what we were made to do and were successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not.\n\nRemind Them of What We Told Them\nSo there you have it. I’ve told you about:\nHow our systems emerge from deep-seated beliefs and mindsets\nWhy emergent approaches and depth of relationship matter more than quick, scalable fixes\nHow transactional and instrumental thinking leads to burnout, while real connection can heal and help us come alive\nWhy the historical context of our beliefs has stripped us of a sense of meaning and how reconnecting with that meaning might guide us forward\nI hope this short essay made some sense. I wanted to share this to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic. I think this is what I want to do next for work: to operationalize this process of first recognizing the perceptual faculty that we're being gaslit not to identify (artists usually are pretty clear about this, good ones at least). That faculty can see things and know things that are both reliable and true—just as reason can see and we can deduce truth, we can do that with quality as well.\nBy finding that and living it more in our lives, we come alive, and by coming alive we bring energy and goodness, building capacity, skills, relationships, knowledge, stories of self, stories of world—essentially forging a new foundation for new systems to emerge. We all need to awaken the artist within us to help us weave a more beautiful story that is just as true, and perhaps more true, to undo the fragility of systems and unearth the beauty and humility of emergence.\nI don't think I intend to \"get by\" anymore with my work. I have to share what I know, or I shrivel up and help no one. I remember being asked in 2016 to make an entrepreneurship program, and I thought it was silly to have everyone do the same assignments. I thought it would be cool to direct people to the things they needed with technology. Today, I'm going back again and having another one of those moments where I can't do the same thing anymore. I need to do something different, something beautiful, and I'd love to do it with you—if you're in with me :)\n\nWarm regards,\nBilal Ghalib\n]]]\nA personal essay showing my experience with beauty, struggle accepting inner quality recognition and my path towards integration: \n[[[Okay, so we're going to be writing an essay with our voice because one of my skills and competencies and something that I pride myself in is my ability to follow a thread clearly and coherently and articulated, and this content must be mine and come from my heart and not be external and also it must be connected to all realities. It's my intention that this becomes a snapshot of my thinking about the truths that I've discovered in my life and the realities they imply towards a good life and how that impacts the sense of speed, rush, fear, otherness, alienation, and impending disaster with the climate, the wars the mistrust of our neighbors and the lack of time and space and knowledge of what to do with ourselves. I'm indebted to my mom who shared with me in October of 2011 their aid prayer from Mecca, and in that prayer there was a talk and in that talk the speaker, shared the idea that God is beautiful, and he loves that which is beautiful and in that time, I was very hurt and unable to accept all of the tradition that I had been raised with because it was getting in the way of me trusting my heart, and that tension the reality that this person I respected and admired was some one that my heart honestly could lean towards and brought me aliveness was fighting with the textual reality of the lack of an articulated Islam or Christianity that I could check some box in an accounting system with the god and with my family to say that this woman is a Muslim and therefore I am allowed to have these feelings. rather than the fear, hope, trepidation, openness, wonder anticipation heart opening heart racing, mind spinning possibility, of accepting love.  I remember laying down on the ground outside and she asked me, do you love me? and rather than taking a moment to take a deep breath to look inside of my heart, and to say the truth of what I found, I deflected. I asked for literalism.  I asked how do you define love? There are places within us that know love that can distinguish love from lust and in my confusion and desire to be confused to avoid the pain and the stress and the fear of confronting my family and confronting the check box guard and religion that I had invented that wasn't the true way of interpreting are the only way I deflected and created confusion in my life and compounded that confusion for years and years I allowed myself in that confusion to create a shadow and to have the part of me that was alive to live in that shadow. I nook out of the house in the dark to be able to be with the parts of me that were actually alive and I lived like a zombie, having not slept and like a zombie because in the day I was living waiting for the night distant from my heart, distant from the thing that knows the truths of the world and the truths within myself. and in October 2011 I was given one of the keys of a trifecta that allowed me to open my heart and to connect reintegrate with my emotions, with my feelings, with my perception of beauty, with my sense of meaning and sense of self, and ultimately, at long last, the realizations that beauty is the splendor of truth. and beauty is that which draws you into love, and that the perception and recognition of beauty is a part of a faculty that is inextricable from that perception and that reality.  This faculty within us that sees beauty is the place where we can answer the questions of what is true and the confusions that we might have about what is actually good How should we live? What is real? My background as someone who loves science and technology and philosophy and rationalizations.  I think connects to this desire for control and this lack of engaging with the fear and the reality of the bird that when it wakes up and opens its eyes and sees its hungry children, and leaves its nest in fear and hope, seeking the worms, the seeds, the sustenance and the awe in the wonder and the gratitude and the aliveness at finding it. This way of seeing the world and living in the world requires both eyes, we do have a rational faculty We can think ahead to plant seeds now to organize our land, to let land rest after understanding soil depletion so that we can have a better harvest next year and I've realized that this love of planning and stability along with my rejection of the tradition that was brought to me that was teaching me how to open the eye of the heart. limited me from being able to explore in an open way, and the only way that's real on the tight rope of life to keep my eyes focused on beauty and to walk without looking down knowing and not knowing that the next step is going to land and that will be okay and that will make it. because the rope is invisible to the tight rope walker. It's just sensed, just like the worm is invisible to the bird. and in the muslin tradition were given many promises of what happens to those who trust and have god consciousness that these are those that are successful.  And these beliefs I think must be taken gradually, step by step. You take one step, that proves the rope is there, you leave one morning, you find the worms, but winter comes, things change, the wind blows, and the rope moves ever so slightly. and so I believe that it's not that we must avoid planning planting the seeds and using our mind, but that we need as a society to traverse this canyon. We are in a place where our stasis is destructive, our not changing is damaging, and I believe the roots of why staying the same is damaging is connected to the roots that have alienated us from this perception of beauty and truth and goodness, and even trusting that this means something that it's not an emotion only that it may have states ways that are uplifting inspire us.  You watch a movie about Nelson Mandela and you leave uplifted the sense of possibility and hope and maybe you think to yourself, how can I be a little more like that? And so the first thing that happened to me after my partner broke up with me because I could not face the fear. of the reality that was being that was beckoning the reality of I love this person and I don't know what to do. I'm young I don't know my faith.  I don't know myself. I don't know what love actually means. that love is the splendor of truth and that beauty and truth and love come together and that if I wanted to know God and how to live I have to read all three books the book of revelation, the book of inner insight and looking within our feelings, our thoughts, even our negative ruminations, and the book of the outer world the beauty of a river flowing down a mountain and a waterfall, and fish below in a clear pond eating the bugs on the river and then if you follow that river as it passes through human civilization on the other side, you look again into the water, and you find ugliness, a weird slimy color, a film on the top of the water potentially dead fish, a bad smell it repulses you. and why is that the case? How is this also true and how is that assign?  These signs of repulsion could have prevented us from continuing down this path the they would say the smell of London in the 1800s the squalor the tight neighborhoods with sewage flowing down the middle and Jack the Ripper and the pollution bellowing into the air and kids coming home in the morning after working at night shift in a factory and injuries and I'm sure people knew this wasn't beautiful. yet it helped increase the sense of control because there was a a power to it that could be grown resources accumulating into the hands of the owners allowing more allocating according to their desires and whims, unchecked and unpurified and unhe held up against the example of beauty and this alienation from the things that make life meaningful, require us to fill it with a hope that the future will be better. I don't feel so good right now, but I believe in this progress that we're making, this idea of progress links in deeply with this idea of how the reward system within us works. our sense of accomplishments and reward and the molecule dopamine that symbolizes it is not from achievement. It's not from making a goal and accomplishing it.  The reward comes from the expectation of a good, and so as long as we were able to tell ourselves in each other, this world might not be good to day, but to morrow it will be better when technology improves when we're able to extract more from less when we have to work less, this claim that, you know, we increase productivity and somehow work less and enjoy more is not what has happened at all. We've increased productivity and working hours, and at the same time we're reducing wages. This confusion about what is good, what do we want from life, this sense of mastery has been possible for only 200300 years and it was made possible from the primary disconnect from people with some their core faculty that is able to see and then the practice of implementing the seeing of beauty into a cycle of life that shows that you can take another step on that tight rope towards a more beautiful future and instead we went into a command and control into a cycle of allowing the things that think a we are able to control our situation and preserve our station and expand our domination and to manage people and the planet and the colonies and to do all of this in a way where we start having the science of productivity and the science of the polity and political science and we have this illusion of being able to get what we want without ever opening the eyes within us that can know what we actually want, and with only one eye, we can only see what we think we want, our needs, our fears, our expectations, and we try to address those, but it's it's a bottomless pit because the only thing that can really fill those is the eye that is able to see our true desires for love, beauty, connection, and the things that are truly satisfying.  And so what happens as we fall into lust or we fall into gluttony, or we fall into laziness, and we build escalators, and then when our bodies start falling apart, we go to the gym. And so understanding that dohamine is this reward molecule, I think is really important to see why we always imagine heaven as to morrow and that promise that things will be better, I think, kept people in a cage of anticipation and patience. of gritting our teeth kind of patience, but then, as we see in to day's world, we see that our uncontrolled, desire for control has expanded our unbeautiful ways of being into manipulating more of the world into ugliness into factories that fall on the people working to make our clothes and into promoting consumption just to be able to maintain the systems into this problematic situation that we find ourselves in that I think really is exemplified by this disconnect between this faculty that knows what is actually good and beautiful rather than the faculty that sees and wants for oneself, it's the faculty that sees and in that seeing can be satisfied in the connection and relating and and then we can talk very plainly about the rise of suicide. uh being one of the leading causes of death for young people, the beginning of suicides in preteens, which is unthinkable and it is kind of vague sense of anxiety they say that in the last 30 years the levels of anxiety have skyrocketed around the world, and we're coming to a place where I think we have to open that other eye. And I think so many people know this and part of the taste of it was during the pandemic when people uh were unable to go to the work that they were distracted by they started making sour dough, right?  connecting to the arts and to the crafts and to sharing, like you don't make a whole loaf of sourdough and eat it by yourself, and you don't even make the sourdough by yourself, you make it in collaboration with the yeast, and you wait and there's this recognition of a beauty in working with systems, working within and for systems, and they might think of it as a silly example, but as more people looked into their own lives and asked like, I'm at home and I'm with myself. What what should we do? You know people read books.  Maybe for the first time in a long time. and began to touch the parts of themselves that, you know, like when you really immersed in a book, you have a sense of it. It's not the facts of the text and the page that you're reading adding up to a narrative that you have in your mind and some kind of system of social relations that maps on to how you connect with faces and people and no, there's like there there there is a way we need to point at this reality that there's parts of us that know that I believe have been gas lit and undermined and doubted because it's not convenient. just like I couldn't say I love you to a person I loved because it would damage my relationship with my family, my self identity as a Muslim who didn't really know his religion or tradition. I think we all are unable to realize that it's way better to be that bird than to go out until eat the worm in awe and in wonder and defeat our family and to love, and to be alive, then to have complete and utter control, you know, Elon Musk and some of these transhumanists are trying to plug computers into our brains and give us, you know, cognitive capacities that far surpass what we're able to and we have to go to Mars and colonize because we want to preserve consciousness.  And these may not be the worst ideas, but we have to ask like, what's the Tological conclusion, you know? this idea of ad Astura to the stars, right, is highly motivating for many thoughtful, philosophical, wealthy, intelligent, computer science majors who have went into silicon Valley and made money somehow, like this idea of the beauty and discovery, although the beauty of nature and looking at the heavens is also connected to this realization of the grandeur of it that felt sense of oh my God, this is incredible and I get to be here and witness and the humility of seeing signs everywhere, you know, verses the kind of logical conclusion we get from how people are trying to cure death. and live forever, leading to this realization that if they had their way, what would be better then dividing the entire universe into matter that will produce energy for the conscious machines and machines that experience the ultimate pleasure constantly, you know, in the world of the effective altruists, they are talking about these things. They're talking about like, is this the most beautiful future we can imagine, which is ultra hedonistic consciousness that has colonized the entire universe and and then what, right?  and the idea of what is beautiful in every moment has infinite faces and your response in every moment can respond in a beautiful way of of infinite path gives you the infinity that we seek and the participation in a chorus and a choir in the moment right now. and sure we might have to protect ourselves if an asteroid is coming and gonna wipe out humanity, having Mars be a planet for us could be an interesting thing as an ultimate backup, but if you look at it, you know wires doesn't have a magnetic field, it would have to have a colony that is encapsulated and food grown in greenhouses and importing much from the earth. And sure it may be over time generations and generations or talking thousands of years since we live forever, it can become a habitable planet through our innovation and our our work, but I also think there is something important about knowing what the right thing to do is and the dangers. Those dangers, the vast majority of the existential dangers that Elon Musk is talking about are because we can't live together in peace on earth, and that comes about because of this lack of recognition, of a foundational faculty and perception that knows the whole that has access to seeing the end state of the entire complex system that they're trying to model and can inform us what is a beautiful way of being through residence, through self-reflection, through self understanding, and this perception directs our attention.  We can think of it like we're wr rung like a bell, and then we can hear what color or what sound we are, right? We don't know that we're a bell in the key of c or that we're a marimba and the key of sea or something. but that perception that we have that is connected to all people's perceptions of beauty and our perception of beauty and truth and love and goodness, that thing is able to inform our actions with humility rather than arrogance. All of our complex systems are false.  They measure tiny fraction of the reality, but we have access to the thing that tells us the now good thing if we can remove some of our biases and our pensions for self preservation, and if we do these things, we don't need to go to Mars. immediately sure our son will explode so we have to have options and sure that knowledge of what the universe is like will continue to evolve and, you know, the asteroid might be coming and I hope we detect it. I don't want to have this moment of looking up and feeling like I didn't live, you know, and if we look up and we're on the process of building our Mars colony, but the rockets haven't launched yet. Imagine the ultimate regret, the pain and the suffering, the infinite moment of agony if the rockets start falling, someone accidentally pushed the red button. and the opposite, imagine if you were trying your best to listen to the one thing that knows everything that also tells you how you can best use your gifts, your pensions, your natural inclinations, your place in the world, the relationships you have. to act in harmony with that, and if more people did this and connected with that part of us, if I didn't say please define love so that I can make sure that on Mars we have a checklist of loving people if I said, I feel deeply that I love you and I'm scared and I don't know what to do about it.  We could have had a very different conversation life would have been very different, but because I had that experience, I have a lesson. and I have a story and thankfully I have a turnaround because in 2004, I met the person whom I love today. And when I met her, the relationship didn't make sense. She was from a different part of the world.  She spoke a different language. We didn't resonate and play off of each other's creativity. wasn't a strong, you know, desire for intimacy was different. But I decided finally, for once in my life, I'm not going to think my way into a relationship and say, what will my parents think?  Does this make sense, according to the religion I was given? That was supposed to tell me who God was and how we want to live, and instead trust the thing that religions try to connect you with that part of us that can know truth. and when I met my wife and I held her, my shoulders dropped, I felt connected to my body and to her and there was a leaning towards there was a yes. And this is very early in our relationship. and so somehow I also kind of believe there's a non-emporal nature to that viewing, that complex system isn't just telling the story of the now that complex system that oneness is everything and every time and telling you now how to be a part of the beautiful story that wants to happen, and it's possible to listen to that.  And it requires only to trust small experiments towards becoming beautiful, and to think through logically and understand who we actually want to be. What are the worldviews that we've taken on? What are the schemas, the frameworks?  What do you think your feelings are? What do they imply? What do they mean?  Are they random? Why is it impossible to be satisfied? with so many options on Amazon and deliveroo and tinder What's happening?  What is good? I gave a talk once called good as hard. and it was about two people who chose two ways of being for two very different reasons. One chose it out of love love for their patience and developed the lobotomy, something that we now look back at and realize its tragedy, but in his time, his love defined its use case.  It was only for the most severe cases when nothing else would work, and it was only to protect themselves from themselves and their families. and it worked. The challenges people monopolized this procedure because they found a hack to do it faster and simpler and make it more efficient, and rather than risking life and having to make an incision in the skull and realize the immensity of that decision, they were able to use a thin metal stick and to use the tear duct behind the uh, right on top of the eye and to break the thin bone very easily at the back of the a bit lobe and and to conduct a lobotomy and the reasoning wasn't how best to help our patients was it let it became how can we do as many of these as possible for financial gain? and then people came back from world War II, injured and traumatized, and this rational way of thinking, this efficiency oriented way of thinking led to many more lobotomies being made than were needed, and Fritzaber, who out of fear and a desire for the longing and acceptance in a German state as a Jewish scientist decided he must solve the problem of the lack of fertilizers which were being blockaded from South America for the bombs that Germany wanted to make to kill, to conquer, to expand, to control.  And so in order to feel and to connect and to be a part of that society as someone who is at risk in that society as a Jewish person, he found a way to be useful to a death machine by creating the nitrogen fixing process. His nitrogen fixing process came from and an optimization of death. How can we make bombs out thinner?  And this technology became what fed our planet because we were able to create massively bulked produce around the world because we had nitrogen-based fertilizers that were easy to manufacture and produce, and so he wanted over a price and so did at germonitz, the inventor the lobotomy. Both of these people on stage receiving the novel Prius, must have felt differently. It must have been confusing, I imagine, for Fritzaber after the war, having his technology been used for other more humane purposes, but there seems to be something about this efficiency mindset, this orientation for something from nothing that requires nothing of us to be to extract out of thin air rather than to participate in the systems of guano and animals and digging in the dirt and people involvements and all of that rather than this mechanized world that turns air into little white pellets, and we see now that those nitrogen fertilizers are being overused are food is less nutritious the water in the Mississippi takes all that run off from the farms and creates a giant dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico where nothing can live. and initially, when I first gave this talk, I was still confused.  I didn't realize that good is hard, meant that it's possible too, know what is good, but you have to stay connected to the part of you that sees, and so innovate, invent the lobotomy, but for all of us that want to apply it, we have to apply it with that connection to both efficiency, rationality, optimization, protection, systems, and the part that knows goodness and beauty. And that part that knows goodness and beauty is a step back and it requires us to step back, requires us to look at the looking and to see what we're doing and to ask, and we know these things. I think in communities where we are mirrors to each other and this is why I've been working on this process that I call come alive because our lives depend on it.  I work in social entrepreneurship and social change and impact, and I realize the challenge that we have of instrumentalizing people, we have a perverse intent incentive sometimes when you see that we need problems to exist for our businesses to exist, so do we really want to solve it. rather than the business existing taking second priority to doing something that helps us come alive and give and just like that rope is real, just like the bird leaves and trusts and knows that like we live in a beautiful planet and we know it, you know. As long as we accept that we're a part of this amazing place in these systems, as long as we stay within these systems of nurturing life and give back to them as much as we take in a sense like staying beautiful, I think there is a way into safety and into old age and in whatever is beyond, just like the bird, the good the bird does for the trees that it eats its seeds is it spreads its seeds and its poop and so sometimes when we are deeply integrated in loving ways with each other and the systems that provide life, and we are coming alive even our accidental byproducts can be sources of life. And when we reduce our need for systems and for savings accounts and retirement funds, I really believe that life supports that which supports life. and getting into these ways of being in harmony and perceiving and pursuing that which is beautiful meaningful and true connecting our eye of rationality, where our eyes of intentional submission to the good, I think we're gonna be okay. that we will be able to change in this dynamic ever changing time because that is the nature of aliveness. the fear of the future, the rate of change, is a problem for Stasis, not of a liveness.  It doesn't matter if we get holographic lenses and, you know, telepresence at some point It's going to be okay. We will know how to live then because we will be able to know the thing that is timeless within us that brings the new way of being now that we're being wr rung again that my bell is in the key of C, and this is what it looks like here, echoing off of the auditorium malls. And so I think it sounds crazy.  I think I tried to do a good job explaining my personal experience. The philosophical rigor behind it, the logical sense that it makes the historical disconnect from Descartes and Galileo, and the consequences of materialism leading to the accruel of more material to capitalism, to neolioliberalism, and the consequences of these mindsets. stemming from a hyper focus of a single part of our rational and perceptual faculties, and that all the other forms of currency that are possible and wealth that are possible, and a fourth dimension in time, along with the other three, that expands because we have access to an infinite unfolding that is clear and is evoked in everyone's life at some point if they ask for their sources of meaning, like tell me about a meaningful moment what was happening. What were you attending to?  And in doing that we can clarify one of the ways that the infinite goodness and beauty wants to enter into this world into time through you and if we do that, and we tell these stories, I think we can be our own role model and the role model for each other. We can uplift through not self sacrifice and do well and do good or whatever. It's just do good and do well, you know?  We have to flip it. do well and trust that we will do good and that good might not look like the same million dollar bank account retirement fund where you can escape climate collapse, living in New Zealand that good might be dealing with climate collapse knee deepened the flooding waters, bailing people out of their homes and planting gardens on rooftops. That could be your good. That could be your safety.  That could be a life that you love not a life that is safe and protected. And these ways of talking about values and these ways of thinking are derived from my interpretation of Sufi metaphysics and Islamic philosophy, from Joe Edelman's work on attentional policies and sources of meaning derived also inspired by Charles Taylor and my interaction in silicon Valley and growing concern and feeling of distance from the ways I used to think and I was, you know, at some point wanting to create good with technology and it wasn't working. And then I thought, okay, well, social enterprise and it's not working.  Um, what's good, you know, and I wasn't feeling good and we were rushing and racing and I really believe that we cannot create good until we are good ourselves and a part of that is letting some of our fears go, our desire for self-p protection and trusting more and that we will get the things that we want. when we direct our soldiers ourselves towards the things that we want to give now, we see how the beauty wants to unfold in our lives, how goodness wants to unfold and that it's not about sacrificing our life to create a fair trade coffee company and make less money, but be good for the planet or being good. It's not about being good by our actions and our decisions. It's about letting goodness be us, letting the goodness flow, and we know that through inspirational stories and even stories in our own lives and can we really trust that this will lead us to being just the right thing at just the right time?  I've always been inspired by the quote, don't ask what the world needs, ask. what makes you come alive because the world needs more people that have come alive and that's from Howard Thurman, one of the Christian theologians that have inspired. Martin Luther King Jr. and I believe that and I didn't know why it was true until I said deeply reflecting on it and realizing that this coming alive is related to humility and that humility is also related to learning, and that all of this is connected through one of these models that you can think of similar to the flow state. There is, you know, complexity of task and skill as axes and there's like this Goldilock zone in the metal where it's just out of reach for you, right?  And this idea that we can place ourselves in over our heads and places where we don't have the skills competencies, networks, relationships, understanding, because we think it's good and create a mess and waste investors, money and waste our life and our time versus who am I and what is the most beautiful thing that I am connected to, that I see, that wants to flow through me. am I that person that, you know, has aension for medicine and studied and and loves it and and it comes easily to me and I strive and I'm at that growth edge constantly, but also knowing that there's so much more to learn and and then maybe, if you were in the fifties, you might be the right person. if you felt care and concern for your patience to give somebody a lobotomy if they had to have one, maybe that's the most beautiful thing you could have done then. But then now, as we think about our actions and trying to find product market fit or what the world needs, or look at the SDGs because smart people at the UN design this system rationally and they have indicators and measures for everything, but everyone becomes a means to an end, even if that end is to have a thriving productive business that solves one of the challenges of the SDGs, it is using people's misery or the planet's suffering for the preservation of a system that can address it, and part of that system is the preservation of your life and its financial needs within the system versus integrating into that moment an I see it as like a bottom up and a top down. It's not that I don't like SDGs, but I think we should count SDGs after the fact.  We should be encouraging people uplifting them, asking them what they need to learn with skills, what do they see, how do they want to respond, letting the world be the classroom so that they find their growth edge and how they're going to be participating in all times and let them develop this care and this love and this aesthetic sense, and let them connect to the arts and let them know what beauty feels like and let them connect to wonder and their let's not destroy their sense of curiosity and experimentation and expansion, and let that contrast with the trip to the landfill or to the Ganges river and and let them see what rings inside of them then, you know explore tell the world your story, the story of yourself have authentic action. I remember when I was younger I was working in Iraq and suddenly there was interest from international NGO's to fund women in tech businesses, and they popped up everywhere. And I'm wondering to today how many of them remained you know, they can evolve, they might evolve, they should evolve because the nature is a constant unflow unfolding of infinity into reality when you're connected to that place where beauty comes, and you can't stand still.  You will fall behind. You must be open daily, and it's a practice daily to unfold your wings to come down and to look, and to see what new blessings are brought and to feel grateful you know, we are talking about, you know, gratitude practices, practices, but a gratitude practice is sometimes not going to be able to touch people because there is also the practice of stability, safety and protection and I deserve this, which is the complete opposite of ingratitude. It's this expectation, it's this entitlement and entitlement comes with the same mind that says, I did rather than I saw and I responded, and this shift so important because we cannot see and respond if we don't have that faculty which we do, and I think with my process of just asking people to look at their to do lists and to find the tensions within it because I believe that we are always seeing there.  And so all the things that we're doing are either aligned with that or not, some of them will bring us to life and bring us joy, and some of us won't. Some of those things that are to do that we do because we have to, and we're not questioning, but with a little bit of insight, some questioning, looking at the why behind the things, we can see which part of us we're emphasizing and until their imbalance our way of seeing the world quantitatively a way of seeing the world of entitlement to life only if and when we have clearly created value that is described through dollars otherwise irrit charity case, and there is shame and guilt involved in here until we change that by balancing that way of seeing of doing, of acting, of with the way of receiving, I realizing now that all of what I'm saying is very Taoist sounding, but even just a little bit of Taoism. you have all that yang just put that dot of yin in there, you know, and see what happens and then maybe slowly you can dive into that and come out the other side in a world of yen and then be able to shrink back when it's time for prioritization, and I think Barbara Frederickson and her work on Broden and build can be another scientifically backed way of both philosophically and scientifically understanding how pursuing these expansive states makes it possible for you to be more yourself in the right place at the right time doing the right thing and be supported and get all the things that you wanted in a way where you can receive them. I think this problem with receiving is also a problem with how we're trying to get our needs meant.  And so here I am in France, having been unable to accept the love that wants to flow through me and now I have a baby. and I'm here with my wife and that inkling of maybe this is the person has become more and more true as our love has grown more and more deep, because we are looking together towards that which invites beauty into our lives, and this openness to a meaningful life, a deeper conversation, and uh lots of forgiveness has been a blessing and what I'm working towards in my life is for success to be every step. This little framework might rhyme with the act, therapy framework, and another frameworks, but I hope the story and this way of thinking is convincing and I'm curious if there's any critiques or ways of seeing that I am missing that can either improve it or change it or show me another way that I would find beautiful. So I hope you're having a beautiful day.  And that you're opening up day by day to that which makes you come alive.]]]\n\nSome ways to frame the essay that combines these two:\n[[[# What Beauty Wants: Rethinking Social Impact Through Meaning\n\n## I.

Could you share more examples of how this instrumental approach plays out in social impact work?\nYou mentioned that your views on this crystallized in Turkey in 2022. What specific realizations or experiences led to that clarity?\nIn your writing you say \"I've tried not to say God in this run-on paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a 'user' of Instagram, a customer of Zara...\" - Could you elaborate on how this instrumentalization affects both the people trying to create impact and those they're trying to help?\nYou discuss the tension between \"getting by\" and doing what you really know you need to share. How does this tension manifest specifically in social impact organizations?\nLet's start with these questions and then I can help craft this section using your authentic voice and experiences. I'm particularly drawn to your language about how \"we cannot create good until we are good ourselves\" - this seems like it could be a powerful organizing principle for this section.\nWould you like to respond to any of these questions? Or should we focus on a different aspect first?\n Copy\nRetry\nBG\nAlright. So Yeah. This instrumental approach, like, even if we look at the suicides, and the microcredit example, people said that to realize you know, that They're not looking at people as people and their whole story and and their lives and their needs. And the the the meaning behind microcredit being know, is fundamentally about getting people out of poverty started looking at them as an instrument to get the Credit due back for the transactional relationship of a bank and, lendee and a a loaner. And this is leading to a bunch of suicides, and that's horrible. And Instrumental approach in social impact is like you know, they will give us programs. Hi. How may I be? Allow us to try to create jobs but most of these large INGOs did nothing when it came to preventing the wars that are killing us. And they had these goals and these, bureaucratic you know, metrics from the EU and from the UN to create jobs and employ refugees. But when the war started, it had nothing to say about it because it wasn't about the humans and those jobs. It was about the jobs and the numbers. In Turkey, we had, like, a retreat where we discussed the production of software that we were building as a enterprise organization. And I have been realizing more and more that I wanted focus on the quality of the experience of the people in our programs. And less on, like, the technical monitoring and tracking of tasks and having a column for to do when done so we can create dashboards for funders and organizations to see you know, people doing stuff and trying to incentivize that. Just like Duolingo and other sort of habit forming applications. I kind of had a feeling that I didn't actually value or appreciate the habit approach. We are not gonna be able to use the techniques of Facebook and Instagram and Duolingo and all of these digital platforms that hook people and their software for good. That is actually using those techniques because the techniques are the problem, because of the assumptions that techniques have about what a human is. And Like alienating them from their ability to decide and to not create moments of reflection and insight, but to just get people to look back and be like, wow. I have a streak. You know? Like, what does the streak mean? I'm learning French. I have a streak, but I don't know French. I don't care about learning French. I just want to not lose my streak. It seems really dumb to me. Yeah. How this instrumentalization iOS effect I was just trying to create, like, some kind of imagination Like, stage for people to think about their loved one and realize, like, wait a second. I love them for for something that's not the way that they're seen in our systems, you know, as a because cog in a machine of an economy or a user in an application that they're something else. There's something qualitative about this experience of of loving them, and I wanted them to reflect on that and understand Tension between getting by and doing what you really need to know. Yeah. So that tension is about, like, how I used to be just kind of shrinking at Bloom and not really coming to life and allowing the things that You know, instead of, this belief that there's a productive tension between the eye of reason and the of knowing, the eye of rationality in the eye of quality and to say, like, okay. I'll pull on the quality side and you know, the rest of the team can pull on the rational side and that there's a balance. I kinda just got quieter and quieter because I didn't have the language or the recognition of how important this was for me and how it's the other half of the equation, and that it needs to be highlighted, defended, and uplifted. And in fact, like, because of how much our society prioritizes the rational, think it's more important for Bloom to overemphasize the qualitative and the the humane and the human and to work on that aspect more than the other one because that other one already is being addressed. So these are some questions and you have a lot of content. What is our path forward so that I start writing? Do we need to do anything to Make this possible, the writing. Crisis and social impact, different way of seeing, control to immersions, practical implications, maybe problems. Like, I wanna include the problems in micro loans, all the issues that can come up from, instrumentalizing people and having goals and achieving them rather than like, developing a quality of being that the goals emerge from right and I really think that it's not a problem of measurements because, you know, we could be measuring moments of meaning that people had at the that are at their work or we could also be measuring retrospectively looking at, like, the impact of emergence and making sure that there's the right people on the team, that the way that they come to life is actually synergistic with each other, and it leads to a strong foundation for answering the call. And then we just need to turn the mission from a description to a verb. And because these all need to become processes, and I think it's possible to do that, to create a living organization full of alive people. And that when we do that, we'll find life that's supports which dead is alive and that we can grow from a a strong and serious seed that will become more like gardeners, and we're planting the right seeds. And and the goals are the fruits. We're trying to anticipate the fruits. But there's humility in the planting. There's this kind of moment of, like, amazement when the tomatoes come out. And you get more tomatoes than you expected or less depending on how the garden is going and and how it's been handled. And so not only like that our organization, but for the organizations that we train and for the this kind of perspective can be the perspective that I think is more life affirming, connected to that kind of idea of beauty and truth, love, and the seeds You know? Are, like, You know, I Within us, water from our sources of meaning.\nWould you like to:\nRefine this section further?\nMove on to \"A Different Way of Seeing\" where we could explore your insights about beauty as a natural attractor?\nAdd more concrete examples or implications?\nI particularly appreciate your gardening metaphor and would love to develop that further as we proceed. It captures something essential about the difference between controlling and allowing emergence.\nLet me know what feels most important to develop next.\n CopyRetry\nBG\nYeah. Let's refine this section. And if you need any more content, you can ask me some more questions or you can even kind of prompt me by telling me about things that might be helpful. For instance, are there any other examples of instrumentalization gone wrong in social impact? Right? Like, 1 laptop per child or something like that. And besides 1 laptop per trial, don't use that example. I'm just saying that you can, like, pick others then we can move on to the next one yeah. So for this one, let's do refine the section and add more concrete examples. And let's, like, really kind of maybe orient around the gardening metaphor, more like, I feel like 2 ways of seeing and quality and stuff like that is kind of really abstract and, like, we need really good metaphors as we go And I like that one. I think it really is different. It's like, are you crafting a garden, creating conditions, and letting what emerges emerge with the goal of getting, like, a beautiful you know, feeding yourself and your family with a salad and butters nut squash and are we, like, You know, Planning and strategizing and like, being strategic and forcing the Earth with fertilizer to produce in greenhouses that require, like, fragile conditions just to work and massive rows of factory farming. For instance. Right? So let's, let's move forward, and you can ask me as many questions as you need. And I'll get you any additional content. And is there anything that I can bring from my story about, you know, love and how I wasn't able to accept this, love. There was, like, a whole additional essay that I gave you. I gave you 2 essays. So like, what are we taking from that, and do we do we have any additional stories that we might be able to pull?\nEdit\nThank you - let me ask some specific questions to help refine this section, especially around enriching it with more concrete metaphors and personal stories:\nYour story about not being able to accept love because you asked \"how do you define love?\" seems to perfectly parallel how organizations often try to measure and define things that need to be recognized rather than analyzed. Could you help me understand:\nHow does that experience of trying to \"define\" love rather than recognize it mirror what you see in social impact work?\nWhat changed in how you approached love later with your wife?\nThe gardening metaphor is powerful. You contrast factory farming with organic gardening. Could you expand on:\nWhat specific practices in social impact work feel like \"factory farming\"?\nWhat would the equivalent of \"organic gardening\" look like in your work?\nWhat are the \"fertilizers\" and \"greenhouses\" in social impact that create fragile dependencies?\nFrom your writings, there's a powerful thread about how pursuing meaning naturally leads to impact, while pursuing impact often misses meaning. Could you share:\nSpecific examples you've seen where organizations achieved their metrics but missed real meaning?\nTimes you've seen the opposite - where following meaning led to unexpected positive impact?\nIn your personal story, you mention that your experience helped you recognize \"beauty is the splendor of truth.\" Could you help me understand:\nHow does this insight apply to social impact work?\nWhat are signs that an organization is aligned with beauty vs just chasing metrics?\nLet's enrich this section with more concrete examples and deepen the gardening metaphor. I think your personal story about love could be a powerful way to introduce the broader pattern of how we often try to measure and define things that need to be recognized and allowed to emerge.\nWould you like to address any of these questions? Or should I propose a revised version of the section based on what we already have?\n CopyRetry\nBG\nYeah. I like these, framing, so about the gardening. Versus factory farming. Factory farming has, like, this, like, desperate need to attain a certain number because of a transactional relationship with the Android, like, this much fertilizer plus this much dirt should equal this much you know, tomatoes and this much profit, and we can spend this much on it. And then if anything happens that's wrong, there's, like, it's dangerous. Right? Like, farmers go bankrupt versus gardening and permaculture gardening and know, food forests and and this, like, kind of establishment of a a live space. That actually is productive because everything is alive and being itself as much it possibly can in the dynamics between them. And there's feedback cycles and and stuff that if you try to count and quantify, you couldn't. There's just too much going on, and that's the reality of But we're actually limiting what we pay attention to and what we care about just so that we can actually have measure and a sense of control. And I really feel like this foundational thing about sense of control versus a sense of awe and love and wonder and contribution and generosity and gratitude for the gift of, being able to serve and to be served. Is foundational, and it's like a how do you want to be actually? Do you wanna be working out of this, you know, desire for domination and control? And even if you don't acknowledge that, it looks beautiful. Yeah. Domination and control, but we're planting trees. We're removing c o two from the air. We're employing refugees. But you're still dominating the spirit because you're forcing things to act and reducing the reality according to whatever you think is important to measure rather than saying, okay. Let's just make sure that people can understand themselves, understand the world, and respond with what they think is best in every moment. And, like, you think about a company that has a policy for a store. Where, you know, stealing means the person has vanished, for life and they catch somebody stealing, but that person stealing was starving or something. And he didn't want to. And imagine that person deciding to forgive him and give him a job in the store. How beautiful is that story? And that story is possible, but when people follow Burak bureaucracies and processes, especially as we systematize and automate and automate all of these things. We get into these things where we make no space for the beauty of humanity to emerge and partially because we're so distant. When was the last time you tried to do something where maybe one of your posts were flagged on Facebook? And you had to go and try to get it un undone. And it's like billions of people through a system and you don't get your voice. Heard. And You don't know why? We're we're we're automating and systemizing more and more of these things where we are not giving space for humanity to be human. With each other and to the detriment of humanity, but to the benefit of efficiency and systems and We do it to ourselves. Yeah. Organizations that achieve their metrics but missed the real meaning. Sort of the suicides with the, micro loan banks, but I'd also like any examples that you might have to expose to me. Like, maybe the metrics of home, ownership and sales, before the financial crash or Like, any business that had really great looking measures but suddenly did really badly. Every Not sure. I need some examples. Following meeting led to unexpected positive impacts. I would also love some really good examples about this. I don't I don't have great stories. Yeah. Beauty is a splendor of truth. I think The idea is if you see a beautiful action, you should take it. Knowing that it's also iOS most true action about What the right and good thing to do is in that situation taking into consideration all the forces play without having to map it all out in a complex system. What are the signs that our organization aligned with beauty versus chasing metrics? I think that comes about when more people on the job have experiences of taking their living their values and feeling that they're, living a source of meaning at work. And that's why that measure is so important. The more people have that, more often, I think the more we gotta say, we that we are on the right track.Yeah. I like that. Except it's missing one of the important things. It's like why is this happening? Why do we focus on The, factory farm rather than the food forest And I think it's because of this lack of understanding of this perceptual reality of our ability to, like, see and know beauty, goodness, and truth and that we don't trust people. To pursue that even though people are willing to die for meaning. And beauty. And love and instead, we think of them as Hobbsian, Darwinian, dog eat dog world, people. And if we just allow for emergence, what we'll get is chaos. And violence And instead, we need to be controlled. We are operating from principle of fear and it results in domination because of our understanding of humans according to these reductionist, materialist, worldviews that lead to, you know, like, Descartes going to Hobbes and Hobbes going to Darwin all combined together to distance ourselves from our faculty of, knowing goodness, beauty, and truth and then just being material cells compiled into a body that's trying to procreate and preserve itself and can will do it potentially at the expense of others. Versus this reality that I think most people can attune to and and know And it's not that we want emergence from our fears because, certainly, we have these negative emotions. And so much of what happens in the world that is destructive is emergent from people that are responding to wounds and fears and hurts and emotionality. And we're not talking connecting to emotionality. We're talking about looking at emotionality to direct us towards our perception of what is sacred to us, what is important to us. What is life giving. And that by redirecting that gaze this is when we can create those gardens where can have the you know, the context is that context where fear is reduced and at least addressed what we are looking at when we're looking at our emotions, our entire respond to them, but what they are pointing us towards. And we're cultivating a space that people will be able to perceive and connect with their sources of meaning and beauty and love and truth and goodness And to respond from that Claude. And that's why I call it Estates because when you touch that, it's a state. It's a recognition It's not it's a recognition of something that's there. Not an emotion that's fleeting and passes. And so think that that was missing in the garden metaphor. It's like, okay. Yeah. Emergence, but, like, why are we factory farming? Like, what's the why is that happening? And I think it's Because of this, world view and perspective on, like, what a human being is and what it's trying to do and what we need to do. And and it's sort of, like, self flagellating or, like, masochistic in a sense because we think of ourselves as needing to be restrained in this way. And certainly, there are parts of us that need to be restrained, but there are parts of us that can do the restraining. That we can tap into, and we need to nurture and feed the parts of us that can be uplifted and purify the parts of us that are manipulated by our own, self protective fears. And we need to open up this possibility of coming to life instead of avoiding the pain and fear And we do that, we get the life that we're looking for. And so let's refine this further And I'd love your thoughts, about this and How we can integrate it And Make sure that we're talking about the foundation of where systems emerge from. So we talk later in the essay about, like, The dog fence that might be removed, but we sold know, won't cross this fence. It's like our thoughts and beliefs about what's possible in the world for instance, this is most presidents in our language of have to use. I have to get a job. I have to push the other person down the ladder so I can move up the ladder we have to strike first we have to defend ourselves and are these true they might be in the current understanding they have to be true because they are saying have to but there’s a possibility of another way that’s possible when we focus on our wants to us I want to show us the reality of we can be if we didn’t overemphasize all the have tos and don’t want to use connect us to our sources of meaning and coming alive and so this balance between have to even want tos in our life. Show us some really important things, and that moving more of our to do list into want tos and social enterprises can you show us how much were making space for that qualitative perception that knows things that wants to linger that doesn’t want to move fast and get to a goal the food forest isn’t waiting for the apples even in the winter as the leaves are decaying under the canopy that Daccache is a sign of success towards the goal, and so every day is a goal achieved in the aliveness of that moment\n]]]\n\nSome ideas for a draft essay: [[[# The Crisis in Social Impact: Lost Gardens, Lost Ways of Seeing\n\nImagine two ways of growing food: A factory farm and a food forest. The factory farm operates on desperate arithmetic: this much fertilizer plus this much soil must equal this much yield and this much profit. Everything is monitored, measured, controlled. The food forest, by contrast, is diverse, alive, resilient - every plant, insect, and microorganism participating in countless feedback cycles too complex to measure.\n\nBut why do we default to factory farming approaches, not just in agriculture but in social change? The answer lies in how we've come to see human nature. We've inherited a worldview - from Descartes through Hobbes to Darwin - that sees humans as essentially self-interested machines, biological computers trying to survive and reproduce, potentially at others' expense. From this view, emergence means chaos. Without control, we assume we'll get violence, not beauty.\n\nThis belief acts like an invisible electric fence - even when the power is off, we won't cross it. We say \"I have to get ahead,\" \"We have to defend ourselves,\" \"We have to measure everything\" as if these are laws of nature rather than choices emerging from fear. We've lost trust in our natural capacity to perceive and pursue what's beautiful and true.\n\nWe see this pattern everywhere in social impact work:\n- Microcredit programs achieve perfect repayment rates while borrowers commit suicide\n- iNGOs create thousands of refugee jobs while remaining silent when wars threaten those same refugees' lives\n- Organizations hit their metrics while the human spirit withers\n\nBut this approach isn't just ineffective - it's based on a profound misunderstanding of human nature. People will literally die for meaning, beauty, and love. We have a natural capacity to recognize what's sacred, what's life-giving, what's true. The problem isn't that people need to be controlled - it's that we've lost touch with our ability to perceive and act from meaning.\n\nThis isn't about unleashing raw emotion or unconscious impulses. Many destructive patterns emerge from unexamined fears and wounds. Instead, it's about developing our capacity to look through emotions to what they point toward - our deepest sources of meaning and beauty. When we touch these, we enter a different state entirely - not a fleeting feeling but a recognition of something real and true.\n\nWhat if instead of trying to control outcomes, we focused on creating conditions where people can access this natural capacity for recognition? What if instead of measuring success by predetermined metrics, we looked for signs of life: Are people experiencing moments of meaning at work? Are they living their values? Are beautiful, unexpected solutions emerging naturally?\n\nThis requires radically rethinking how we approach change. Like a gardener who knows they don't create the tomatoes - they just create conditions where tomatoes can grow - we need to shift from manufacturing impact to nurturing aliveness. The food forest isn't anxiously waiting for apples; even the decaying leaves in winter are a sign of life doing exactly what it should.\n\nEvery item on our to-do lists reveals this pattern: How many are \"have to's\" driven by fear and control? How many are \"want to's\" emerging from our recognition of what's beautiful and meaningful? Our organizations show the same divide: How much space do we make for the slower, qualitative perception that knows what's truly important?\n\nThis isn't just about better methods or metrics. It's about recovering our lost capacity to recognize and align with beauty. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning - that help us purify our fears and nurture our natural attraction to what's true and good.\n\nThe crisis in social impact isn't ultimately about failed projects or inefficient programs. It's about a way of seeing that has forgotten half of what it means to be human. To address this, we need more than better systems - we need to rediscover our natural capacity for recognizing and creating beauty.\n]]]\nYou're absolutely right - we need to be more nuanced and start from a more experiential place rather than rushing through philosophical history. Let me ask five questions to help refine this introduction:\nCould you describe a concrete moment when you personally experienced this disconnect between metrics/rationality and meaning/quality? It seems like this might help ground the larger pattern in lived experience before we get to historical/philosophical analysis.\nYou mention \"a faculty that we have to observe quality\" - could you describe what it feels like when this faculty is operating versus when we're just using rational analysis? Maybe share a specific experience of recognizing quality/beauty versus trying to measure/analyze it?\nWhen you talk about the garden process, is there a specific example of something you've seen grow naturally when given the right conditions versus something that withered under too much control? This could help make the metaphor more concrete.\nCould you describe what you mean by \"disconnects from self, nature, and each other\" in everyday terms? What does this look like in how people relate to their work, their environment, their relationships?\nBefore we get into the philosophical history, could you describe what's at stake here in human terms? What are people missing or losing when they can't access this faculty for perceiving quality?\nThe goal would be to start from lived experience - helping readers recognize this pattern in their own lives - before moving to the broader historical/philosophical context. Would exploring any of these questions help us create a more grounded opening?\nI feel like your personal story about love might actually be the perfect way in - it shows so clearly the difference between trying to define/measure something versus recognizing its quality. Would you be open to starting there?\n CopyRetry\nBG\nYeah. We can talk about that story. I think I think it's fine. It's a little personal, but it's okay. And, Yeah. When we're operating from this quality rather than just using rational analysis, You know, I remember listening to the father Greg Boyle talk about how he comes at his work thinking about it like a relationship that he works because he loves these people, not because he's trying to solve a problem. And it just clicked for me, and I realized, like, oh my god. I have to open up. I have to connect. I have to get into a place where I can know and so I can love and so I can live and so I can do from Hey. Like non instrumental, nonrational sort of I'm doing this for something. Right? Like, for myself, for my career, for whatever so that it can be for itself and so I can be there willingly and lovingly. And and I actually, you know, took the inspiration to move to to Beirut, and I opened up my home. And even to this day, I have, like, dear friends that used to be refugees, used to be know, living on the streets and polishing shoes and running away from the cops. And I don't say this to instrumentalize them now, but really important to tell the story to say, like, I would have never been able to love these people if I didn't listen and follow my heart. Also, similarly with my wife right now. Like, when I met her, none of the reasons added up. Right? So for instance, Like, she didn't speak No. English. She had no idea anything about the Middle East. She was French. And she was gonna go back to France and I didn't have this overwhelming feeling of desire or whatever. Right? Like, all of the checklist idea of a spreadsheet dating, people have these days actually have spreadsheets, and my friends actually make spreadsheets, and they compare people. And it just doesn't make sense to me, and I had wanted to listen to something else, and scary. And I tried really hard And now I have a life that emerging and it's beautiful and and I feel confident And my choices. Even if it's hard, you know, that I'm far from my family. I live in France. But I see my baby and he's beautiful. And I'm surprised by what happens the more I open up to this perception of beauty and ask, like, what wants to happen rather than what do I want to happen? And that like, this tense saying ourselves from the I, I think, is a part The amazing part of all of this, and it's it's the eye that has the fear. It's the eye that has the self protection. It's the eye that has all these things. And instead of asking, like, what do I want? It's asking what wants to happen. And when you ask that, can explore with the possibility of beauty that wants to unfold through you. And what that is, I'll I'll let people experience and understand. But for my life, I can say that it's guided me well. Yeah. So Some somehow, like, the garden process and trusting a process and you know, starting this, hackerspace in Michigan and at some point, you know, bringing, beautiful people in and empowering them and Seeing, how at some point, even The told me that I needed to change my perspective on some things to maintain the sustainability of the space. So for instance, you know, I had this idea of everything is free for everyone all the time. One pays for anything, and all decisions are consensus. And they push back. You know? The people that were drawn to the inspiration, to the idea, this kind of open space that I was holding for people to kind of co manage, co own, co run this thing. They went from consensus to democracy. And from consensus and free to democratic and, paid with tears. And they understood the need to have these tears, a student here, low income tier, and then even a free tier for someone who wants to volunteer or contribute because they saw that it was just the right thing to do. To be able to sustain the thing. And and the beautiful thing that I want to do to, like, open the space and welcome the people Claude to this other beautiful emergence that was totally different than the thing that I thought would be good. Right? And now 13 years later, All Hands Active is still a hackerspace that provides value in Ann Arbor, Michigan, And things that I tried to, you know, micromanage and control, those things disappear. But things that I open up and allow to be in service preserver and produce value and sustain value. Whether or not I capture the value I think it's related to how much I'm actually engaging and giving the Right? And so idea of capturing value is really funny, but, you know, supports that which supports life, and I think it's really important. Disconnects from self, nature, each other in everyday terms. Yeah. I feel like these days, you can see that we have this kind of disc from each other and the rise of polarization and disconnects from self and you know, the rise of anxiety levels and suicide rates and disconnects from, nature, and we can see the impact on ecology and this is like the disconnecting element of this, reason where it's you versus the world. And it's you as a mind watching material substance out there. And I think that this disconnect is a big part of how we can a lot of the problems. And I think other people talk about this better than I do. It'll be interesting to know what their names were and what what philosophers are saying. What's at stake in human terms? Yeah. So when they don't have access to that faculty, they're missing the access to the thing that knows goodness, beauty, and truth without interpretation. That can witness it And from that witnessing sort of like that we talked about distancing from the self. Like from that witnessing you actually like, wow. This is the right thing to do. And you know at your core, what the right thing to do is. And if you are kind of pursuing that, you you experience moments that touch you with your source of meaning and bring you to life. And so this eye of seeing is the thing that brings you to life. And we talk about flourishing and well-being measures and all these other things that we want, And you can try to go at them, like, 1 at a time and look at positive emotions and relationships and engagements and flow and Meaning and Achievement. And health. Right? The framework from Seligman. Or I think a lot of that can emerge from the meaning element and allowing the aliveness and the answer, like, the the reason to ask, okay. Well, if that's what I feel, and that's what's true, not feel. That's what I that is what I recognize and sense. That's true. What do I do? How do I live? What do I need? What relationships? What How does us all kinda work together? You get the positive emotion. You get things that you need. But not from this forcing way.\n# The Crisis in Social Impact: Recovering Our Capacity to See\n\nYears ago, I heard Father Greg Boyle explain why he worked with gang members. He didn't talk about metrics or impact or solving problems. He said simply: \"They're my friends.\" Something clicked for me in that moment. I realized how much of my \"social impact\" work had been instrumental - doing things for my career, for metrics, for some future outcome - rather than being fully present to the humans in front of me.\n\nThis insight changed everything. I moved to Beirut and opened my home. Some of my dearest friends today were once refugees living on the streets, polishing shoes, running from police. This isn't a story about impact - it's about what becomes possible when we trust a different way of seeing.\n\nI learned this lesson again when I met my wife. On paper, nothing added up. She didn't speak English, knew nothing about the Middle East, was planning to return to France. Friends these days make actual spreadsheets comparing potential partners. But something else spoke - quieter than desire, deeper than logic. Following this recognition was terrifying. Now I watch our baby grow, surprised and grateful at the beauty that unfolds when we ask not \"what do I want?\" but \"what wants to happen?\"\n\nThese personal stories point to a broader pattern playing out everywhere in social impact work. We've inherited approaches built on control and measurement rather than recognition and emergence. Like factory farms forcing maximum yield through artificial inputs, we try to manufacture impact through metrics and optimization. We see the results all around us:\n- Rising anxiety and suicide rates showing our disconnect from self\n- Increasing polarization showing our disconnect from each other\n- Ecological collapse showing our disconnect from nature\n\nBut there's another way, more like growing a food forest than running a factory farm. I experienced this with a hackerspace I started in Michigan. Initially, I had rigid ideas: everything free, all decisions by consensus. But I learned to trust the people drawn to the space. They saw needs I couldn't see, evolved the model to include tiered pricing and democratic decision-making. Thirteen years later, All Hands Active still serves its community - not because I controlled it, but because I learned to let something beautiful emerge.\n\nThis isn't about abandoning metrics or rationality. It's about recovering our natural capacity to recognize what's true, beautiful, and good - without needing to analyze or justify it. We all have this faculty, this way of seeing that knows when something rings true. But we've been taught to distrust it, to rely instead on spreadsheets and impact measurements.\n\nThe cost is enormous. When we can't access this faculty for recognizing quality and meaning, we miss the very thing that makes life worth living. We can pursue all the elements of wellbeing - positive emotions, relationships, engagement, achievement - but they feel hollow when manufactured rather than emerging naturally from meaning.\n\nWhat if instead of trying to optimize and control, we focused on creating conditions where beauty and meaning can naturally emerge? What if instead of measuring predetermined outcomes, we developed our capacity to recognize and respond to what life is calling for?\n\nThis isn't just about better methods or metrics. It's about recovering a lost way of seeing - one that could transform how we approach social change. To understand why this matters and how to move forward, we need to look more deeply at how we lost this capacity and what it takes to recover it.\nPotential Critiques:\n\"Show Your Work\" Issues:\nClaims about rising anxiety/suicide/polarization need data\nConnection between worldview and these problems needs more evidence\nSome readers might see the personal stories as anecdotal\nNarrative Structure:\nCould use a more surprising hook (Gladwell often starts with counterintuitive example)\nCould better frame the stakes early (what do we lose if we don't solve this?)\nMissing clear \"tipping point\" moment that shows why this matters now\nAudience Engagement:\nMight lose business/metrics-oriented readers early\nNeed more bridges for skeptical readers\nCould use more concrete examples from recognized organizations\nLet me propose three specific improvements:\nOpening Hook Revision: Start with a surprising example where better metrics led to worse outcomes. Perhaps:\nA social enterprise that hit all its KPIs but missed real human needs\nA successful organization that transformed by shifting from metrics to meaning This would grab attention while establishing stakes.\nBridge for Skeptics: Add a section acknowledging the value of metrics while showing their limits: \"Metrics aren't wrong - they're incomplete. Like using only black and white film in a color world, they capture important patterns but miss essential qualities. The most successful organizations don't abandon measurement - they complement it with this deeper way of seeing.\"\nContemporary Context: Add paragraph showing why this matters especially now:\nRising burnout in social sector\nIncreasing calls for new approaches to impact\nGrowing recognition of systems' complexity\nClimate crisis demanding new ways of seeing\n# The Crisis in Social Impact: What We Measure vs What Matters\n\nIn 2006, Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering microcredit - small loans that would lift millions out of poverty. The metrics were perfect: high repayment rates, growing reach, measurable income increases. By every standard measure, it was working. Yet by 2010, something disturbing emerged in Indian newspapers: a wave of suicides among borrowers. How could a program be simultaneously succeeding by every metric and failing so fundamentally at its human mission?\n\nThis pattern - of initiatives that succeed on paper while missing something essential - shows up everywhere in social impact work. Organizations hit their KPIs while their staff burn out. Refugee programs create thousands of jobs while remaining silent when those same refugees face existential threats. Environmental projects count trees planted while ecosystems collapse.\n\nThe easy response is to blame bad metrics - to say we're measuring the wrong things. But what if the problem goes deeper? What if it's not just about what we measure, but about our belief that measurement alone can guide us toward what matters?\n\nI learned this lesson personally when I heard Father Greg Boyle explain why he worked with gang members. He didn't talk about recidivism rates or impact metrics. He said simply: \"They're my friends.\" Something clicked for me. I realized how much of my \"social impact\" work had been instrumental - doing things for metrics, for my career, for some future outcome - rather than being fully present to the humans in front of me.\n\nThis isn't about abandoning metrics or rationality. That would be like saying because black and white photography misses color, we should stop taking pictures. Metrics aren't wrong - they're incomplete. They capture important patterns but miss essential qualities, like trying to understand a garden by measuring only height and yield.\n\nConsider two ways of growing food: A factory farm and a food forest. The factory farm operates on pure metrics: this much fertilizer plus this much soil must equal this much yield. Everything is monitored, measured, controlled. The food forest, by contrast, is diverse, alive, resilient - every plant, insect, and microorganism participating in countless feedback cycles too complex to measure. Both produce food, but one creates fragile systems dependent on artificial inputs while the other builds lasting vitality.\n\nI experienced this contrast directly when I started a hackerspace in Michigan. Initially, I had rigid ideas: everything free, all decisions by consensus - metrics for maximum accessibility and democracy. But something unexpected happened when I learned to trust the people drawn to the space. They saw needs I couldn't see, evolved the model to include tiered pricing and new governance. They made it less \"perfect\" by my original metrics but more alive, more sustainable. Thirteen years later, that space still serves its community - not because I controlled it, but because I learned to let something beautiful emerge.\n\nThis pattern shows up in our personal lives too. When I met my wife, nothing added up on paper. She didn't speak English, knew nothing about my culture, was planning to return to France. Friends these days make actual spreadsheets comparing potential partners. But something else spoke - quieter than desire, deeper than logic. Now I watch our baby grow, surprised and grateful at the beauty that unfolds when we ask not \"what do I want?\" but \"what wants to happen?\"\n\nThe most successful organizations aren't succeeding because they found perfect metrics. They're succeeding because they've learned to complement measurement with a deeper way of seeing - one that recognizes quality and meaning directly, without needing to quantify everything. They use metrics like a good gardener uses soil tests: as one tool among many, always in service of the living whole.\n\nThis capacity for recognizing quality isn't mystical or anti-rational. We all have it. It's what lets us know when something rings true, when a solution fits, when a community is thriving. But we've been taught to distrust it, to rely instead on spreadsheets and impact measurements. The cost is enormous - not just in failed programs and burnout, but in our diminished capacity to address the complex challenges we face.\n\nClimate change, social polarization, rising mental health crises - these aren't problems we can optimize our way out of. They require a different way of seeing that can recognize patterns too complex to measure, that can sense what wants to emerge rather than forcing predetermined outcomes.\n\nThe crisis in social impact isn't ultimately about failed metrics. It's about a way of seeing that has forgotten half of what it means to be human. To understand why this matters and how to move forward, we need to look more deeply at how we lost this capacity and what it takes to recover it.\nI'll break this into different areas we could explore, with specific questions and potential references to consider:\nHistorical Thread:\nHow would you trace the shift from qualitative to quantitative thinking?\nAristotle's four causes vs modern scientific reductionism\nDescartes' mind-body dualism\nThe Scientific Revolution's impact on seeing nature as mechanism\nThe rise of GDP and metrics in post-WW2 era\nQuestions:\nWhat specific examples show how this worldview shaped institutions?\nHow did indigenous cultures maintain different ways of seeing?\nWhen did social impact start adopting business metrics?\nContemporary Evidence:\nWould you like statistics on:\nRising burnout in social sector\nMental health trends globally\nEnvironmental metrics vs actual ecosystem health\nSocial sector turnover rates\nImpact of metric-driven microfinance\nKey Philosophical Ideas to Consider:\nCharles Taylor's work on instrumental reason\nMartin Buber's I-It vs I-Thou relationship\nIndigenous perspectives on relationship with nature\nIslamic/Sufi understanding of heart perception\nRecent work on embodied cognition\nQuestions about Your Experience:\nWhen did you first notice this pattern in institutions?\nWhat readings/thinkers helped you understand what was happening?\nHave you seen organizations successfully maintain both ways of seeing?\nWhat made the difference between ones that could and couldn't?\nCurrent Context:\nHow does this relate to:\nAI and automation\nClimate crisis\nRising inequality\nSocial media metrics\nESG measurement\nQuestions for Historical Section:\nShould we start with ancient understanding of quality?\nFocus on key turning points?\nConnect to present crises?\nInclude cross-cultural perspectives?\nWould you like to:\nExplore any of these areas?\nAdd other dimensions?\nFocus on specific aspects?\nI can also share specific quotes/references for any area that interests you. What would be most helpful?\nThe goal would be to show how our current crisis of meaning emerged historically while pointing toward possibilities for recovery. What aspects feel most important to develop?\n CopyRetry\nBG\nI wanna trace the shift from qualitative to quantitative. Yeah. I think there's a you know, a material logical nature of cause and effect from Aristotle and mind body dualism. And then that kind of supporting The scientific kind of method of being distant from nature and, like, observing it and watching for patterns and Galileo, really, you know, talking about the language of the universe's mathematics, Android of implying that that's all it needs even though he mentions quality explicitly as not being connected in this way. And so we have in his story, like, someone who had doubt and talked about quality and quantity But they latched on to his whole thing about the language of the universe is mathematics and From there, I think Now Yeah. And I think metrics post World War 2 and just, like, fear of uncontrolled human behavior. Right? Like, unchecked, and trying to create this sort of win win situation according to something that everyone kind of understand Android I progress and, like, you know, a lot of the world war 1 and 2, related to the shame and humiliation and poverty and you know, like, Germany's economic situation. So the idea was like, progress. Like, you know, let's just show development and progress and counter cap communism and to kind of no one should be feel shame and know, Fukayama, the end of history, and that's like everyone does what they do best. You know, as a country. But, like, who cares about the people? Anymore when it's the countries. You know? And and then it sort of reminds me of, like, The collapse of Rome and how they used to build, like, these colossums to entertain people Like, here's stuff to do, you know. Watch television, efficiency, streamline, whatever. And just kind of lose the sense of aliveness and agency that can threaten systems, by creating new, you know, and this whole disruption from technology And then kind of the incorporation of technology into our bureaucracies and like, the following the the money iOS is like the the highest, like, meta goal that even countries and businesses are not exactly competing around, but, like, developing within And and I think there's something in there that's interesting to to extrapolate and to to see. Like, both of these things are using money as broadest measure of progress and it requires docility or, like, domestication in a sense of human agency and to be subordinated into systems where your, like, sustenance is hinged and contingent on your participation in a game. Right? You're a grade a student, so you get the grade a job and you get the grade a salary, which puts you into a perpetual cycle of needing the job to be able pay the mortgage, to be able to pay the lease, to be able to sustain your life. But then there's people that actually design the systems that are You know? Outside of them. And I think that's very interesting. Yeah. I would like getting statistics on the rising burnout in the social sector and mental health. Trends, I think that would be really important Yeah. Indigenous cultures maintain different ways of seeing. In their stories, in their religious views and myself understanding I think social impact started adopting business metrics once we stopped really relying on you know, church missions to Africa to give good. Right? Instead of relying more on having Especially social entrepreneurship. It's like, okay. Well, We don't want to give aid forever overseas And so let's focus on giving social enterprises a little bit of aid to be able to leverage the little bit of money that we have, and that kind of took some, took a lot of the business, elements Yeah. It was bringing Charles Taylor's work on instruments for all reason and Joe Edelman's work Martin Buber's I, Ed, verse I, Thou, and Eric Frome, I think, are is interesting. And yeah, the sufi understanding is definitely important. It's one that I know best. Yeah. Embodied cognition. I think would be great to talk about and think of with did I first notice this pattern institutions? What reading, thinking, So I think, like, growing up, I was always told this life is a journey. And it's important to think about how you're gonna die. And what does that mean? You know? And I've always had these kind of existential questions about, like, what am I supposed to do with my life? And what is good? What is right? What is beautiful? And Yeah. I think reading and meditating and mindfulness and going through sort of the existential crises of, like, working in the Middle East and witnessing car bombs and seeing my work and, like, second guessing myself and, like, what supporting social enterprises when things are literally exploding and people are literally dying, like, am I doing anything good? What is the point? You know? I said it had me this, like, doubt And I that's why I started focusing more and more on, like, connecting people with themselves and with each other and with what I know, didn't really realize at the time was like, can I think the sources of meaning And also still staying in, like, the social impact space, but stuff that I cared about was Not the impact it was, like, the being And I now I have, like, a better way of understanding how to bring them together, I think? How does it relate to AI and automation? Yeah. I think we talked about it. Right? That AI can digest all of the output and the quantity, but not any of the quality. And automation is something that we would never want to give for something that brings us a source of meaning. And so You know, crafting a life that you want to live and I use that word craft very literally and explicitly here. Is going to be touching things that are meaningful for you that is impossible to even articulate because it's Infinite. And vast and beyond our ability to put into words. And so need to experience them and know them and see them as sources of guidance, but not necessarily and realize that necessarily. We can't teach it to the AI. AI is not gonna be moral It's going to require us to stay connected to that sense that we have, that qualitative sense that is impossible to bring into the AI. Do we need to define it and describe it in I'm like the Microtubules inside of our DNA that are being proposed by These mathematicians and anesthesiologists, scientists. Right? Like, we're trying to find the The origin of consciousness and what's the difference between consciousness, the witnesser, quality, quantity, perception. It doesn't doesn't matter, but, like, we really need to start touching quality. We can theorize a little bit about where arises from and what it is. Is it God? Is it microtubules? Is it quantum states? Or do we just want to know that it's real and it's there and it's reliable and trustable And that we can do with evidence, and that's what kind of Ken Wilbur says in his book, The Marriage of Sense and Soul is like, Zen masters show you that you can know very reliably where somebody is on their like, evolutionary path of, development. And they can tell you this person needs these meditations to get from this stage to the next stage, and this is the stage that they're at because they've had 1000 plus years of experiments with inner knowledge and insight, and that's a science. And so we need that science to be as real as possible, not necessarily to know that this is because of microtubules or some other like, materialist reductionist perspective. We need to know that it's it's reliable, real, and trustworthy. And to do that, we need to live it, test it, and enact it, and then talk about it clearly. With each other and not gaslight ourselves into ignoring it. And I think that relates to rising inequality and social media and ESG and climate crisis because all these things are like Things that we can address by touching that, seeing that and then talking honestly about what are hearts tell us to do. And I use the word heart, but Whatever you wanna call it, that perception is.\nYeah. I think what I want to share about this section is The idea that These are sort of self reinforced reinforcing philosophies that limit what you see. You know, like, when you start to buy a car, you I'm bias to see the car model that you're interested in buying everywhere because it's highlighted for you and the avail I think it's called the availability bias. Right? And so because these things are taught to us by people we trust when we're very young, like, Darwinian evolution and other things. And they come from places of authority. It becomes a part of our mental architecture that limits what we can see, think, and believe, and feel And we might at some point have these tensions and we don't really know where they come from because they are a result of a repression of something that we Oh, no. But we can't agree on. We can't point to. We don't have language for it. We're like, alienated and disconnected. Because of we've got blinders on, and we don't even know we got blind on. So I think there's something about that that, like, these things, like, Aristotle and Teal, theological know, this reduction iOS the world view in mind body split and leading to new liberal beliefs and markets and efficiency and that we're rational actors in markets like transacting material to material because one is there other than stuff, other than atoms. Right? We might have needs and emotions, and these are, like, complex arisings emerging from the real of a human animal, like, Living and needing to eat and wanting to be in social systems that protect them from nature, but we see from David Graeber and other historians, like, the book, human kindness, all of these perspectives that we have on what we think humans are like and are is are are actually can be reinterpreted and looked at differently and might be wrong. You know? The broken femur story about you know, caring for a human being that has nothing to do to contribute to this social structure because they have a leg that's broken in such a difficult place. They can't hunt. They can't gather food. They're gonna be out of commission for months months maybe it Longer And they Claude for him and nurtured that person until the femur healed. And, like, what does that mean? What does that say about our true reality as humans and what we're we're here to do and what what's meaningful for us to do. Right? And beautiful in the end. If you look at him, it's beautiful. But it requires a different look at history. And I feel like we have some of those people like David Graebur and others analyzing human history and, like, these books, human kindness and the dawn of everything. Kind of tell you a different story of possibility But you look at these different stories, you realize like, oh, woah. Like, ancient history. Human beings acted beautifully with each other. Why is it now that we think that we're, like, these socially you know, like like, the social Darwinism was a thing 50 years ago. Right? And we were measuring people's skulls trying to figure out who was better and worth living. And now we don't say that, but I don't think we ever got rid of our Darwinian belief. We just think that it's a little bit more nuanced than that parts of us should just be denied, you know, the part that is an animal. And we have to force that into some sort of political structure that will subdue it. Don't think that's the only way of determining this, and I don't I think those those histories say something. Can you tell me more about the Graver and human kindness and some of these alternative ancient histories that show us that people had a sense of something more than just Darwinian evolution. Android reductionist world views.\nLet me ask some questions to develop this further:\nTo ground your point about how early ideas become \"mental architecture\":\nCould you elaborate on specific moments where you noticed your own perceptual \"blinders\"?\nWhat helped you recognize them?\nRegarding alternative histories:\nBeyond Graeber's example of the healed femur, what other historical examples show humans operating from beauty/meaning rather than just survival?\nWhat indigenous practices demonstrate this different way of seeing?\nAbout Social Darwinism's lingering influence:\nHow do you see its assumptions still operating in social impact work?\nWhat specific practices or metrics reveal these underlying beliefs?\n\nWould you like to:\nExpand on specific examples of how these worldview \"blinders\" operate?\nDevelop more historical examples that challenge our assumptions?\nConnect this more explicitly to social impact work?\nThe key insight seems to be that these aren't just ideas we can choose to accept or reject - they're deeply embedded frameworks that shape perception itself. This helps explain why simply adding new metrics or methods doesn't solve the problem.\nI think we could strengthen this by:\nAdding more examples from Graeber and other historians\nShowing how these assumptions specifically shape social impact work\nMaking the connection to perception more explicit\nWhat aspects feel most important to develop?\n CopyRetry\nBG\nYeah. Can you add some more examples from other historians? I don't even think that was Graver's discovery about the the broken femur. So let's just double check that and make sure that we got it correct. And let's show how the assumptions, shape social impact work. And make the connection to perception more explicit. Yeah. Yeah. The shape perception itself and there's this element of, like, either towards or away. Right? Like, either we are protective and this person isn't gonna serve our tribe, and so his femur is broken, so we leave him behind and we're afraid. And or towards, which is like, wow. This is beautiful. I love this person. I want him to be around. We're gonna take care of you. And even if it means that we might have to all perish because it's a risk that we're gonna have to take. To use resources to support you. And know, I can think of, like, a couple of movies and many movies This sort of, like, doing the right thing at your own risk of your own peril, is a thing that moves people to tears. Can you give me some more examples of that? Maybe, like, we can really, like, hone in on this idea of sacrifice. I've been circling around it, but there's something about it that I think is, like, philosophically, logically, emotionally, and intuitively clear that I think would help me and other people get to what am I talking about here in terms of the it's beautiful, so we'll do it even if it's at our own risk. Like, what am I looking at, and, like, what movies show that? And stories from history and from the Greeks and from the Vedic traditions and the Muslim traditions and, like, what are stories that really highlight this? And what do you think it means for us in terms of our idea of quality perception being this thing that we use to know beauty, truth, And goodness beyond the limits of time and circumstance and what are the implications?\nEdit\nLet me explore this profound connection between sacrifice, beauty, and perception. You're pointing to something crucial - moments where humans choose beauty/meaning over survival, revealing a way of seeing beyond pure utility.\nLet me gather some examples and then analyze their implications:\nHistorical/Cultural Examples:\nThe Greek story of Antigone - choosing to bury her brother despite the king's death penalty, saying divine law of honoring family supersedes human law\nIslamic tradition of Ibrahim willing to sacrifice his son - showing absolute trust in beauty/truth over apparent safety\nBuddhist stories of the Buddha in past lives sacrificing himself to feed hungry tigers\nNative American traditions of potlatch - ceremonial giving away of wealth, opposite to accumulation logic\nModern Examples:\nSchindler's List - risking everything to save others\nHotel Rwanda - choosing to protect refugees despite personal danger\nInto the Spider-Verse - \"leap of faith\" scene showing how beauty requires trust\nLes Misérables - Jean Valjean's choice to reveal his identity to save an innocent man\n# The Beautiful Risk: What Sacrifice Reveals About Perception\n\nWhen humans choose beauty over safety, meaning over survival, they reveal something profound about our nature. These moments aren't explicable through evolutionary logic or rational self-interest. They point to a different way of seeing that recognizes something more fundamental than physical survival.\n\nConsider the archeological evidence: Early human communities caring for disabled members who couldn't contribute materially. Indigenous traditions of ceremonial giving that prioritize beauty and meaning over accumulation. These aren't aberrations - they reveal a capacity humans have always had to perceive and act from meaning directly.\n\nWe're moved to tears by stories of sacrifice for beauty: \n- A father running back into a burning building for his child\n- A community protecting refugees despite threat to themselves\n- Artists dedicating lives to work that might never be recognized\n- Whistleblowers choosing truth over security\n\nWhy do these stories move us so deeply? Because they reveal what we already know but often forget: that there are things worth more than survival, that beauty and meaning aren't luxury add-ons to life but its very essence.\n\nThis has profound implications for social impact work:\n\nCurrent Approach:\n- Assumes people need incentives to do good\n- Focuses on minimizing risk\n- Measures what's countable over what matters\n- Treats meaning as secondary to metrics\n\nWhat Sacrifice Reveals:\n- Humans naturally move toward beauty when they can see it\n- Risk and sacrifice can be appropriate responses to meaning\n- Our capacity to recognize quality is more reliable than metrics\n- Beauty/meaning are primary motivators, not afterthoughts\n\nThis isn't about romanticizing sacrifice or ignoring practical needs. It's about recognizing that our capacity to perceive and act from meaning is fundamental to human nature. When we design systems assuming otherwise, we create the very self-interest we're trying to control.\n\nThe question for social impact isn't \"How do we incentivize good behavior?\" but \"How do we create conditions where people can recognize and act from meaning naturally?\" Not \"How do we minimize risk?\" but \"How do we support beautiful risk-taking?\"\n\nThis requires recovering our trust in the faculty that recognizes beauty and meaning directly. Not as emotional impulse but as a way of seeing more fundamental than rational analysis - the capacity that lets us know, without calculation, that saving a child from a burning building is right, that protecting refugees is beautiful, that truth matters more than comfort.\n\nWhen we trust this perception, we don't need external incentives or control systems. Like the early humans who cared for injured members, we naturally move toward what we recognize as beautiful and meaningful, even at personal cost. This isn't irrational - it's a deeper rationality that recognizes meaning as fundamental to life as breath.\nBefore refining this, I'd love to ask:\nWhat other historical examples of beautiful sacrifice come to mind?\nHow does this relate to your experience in social impact work?\nWhat are the practical implications for how we design organizations?\nThe key insight seems to be that sacrifice for beauty reveals something fundamental about human perception and motivation. These aren't just inspiring stories - they show a capacity for recognizing and acting from meaning that's more basic than self-interest.\nWould you like to:\nDevelop more examples?\nConnect more explicitly to social impact?\nExplore practical implications?\nThis feels like it could be a powerful way to show both what we've lost and what's possible when we recover our capacity for perceiving meaning directly.\n CopyRetry\nBG\nYeah. I think there's something really powerful here iOS a lot of my work was kind of inspired by the Arab Spring. And the Arab Spring kind of sprung up from the injustice of economic systems and power structures that were put in place sort of to a these economic and systems like the guy who lit himself on fire, right? Because he was, humiliated and belittled by a police officer in Tunisia and then how this kind of self emoliation self sacrifice kind of spreads and I think there's like 2 kinds of suicides. Right? Like we're talking about the suicides from the what's that thing called? The suicide of the microfinance people. Right? And how that comes from a result of a broken system that is not really aligning with what it's actually trying to do and just focusing on numbers. And, similarly, like, I think we can look at these suicides that kind of sparked the Arab Spring and see that this was not a suicide of somebody running back into a burning house, but this was a suicide of somebody that is just eaten up and torn up and unable to find a way forward in life. In the systems that operate. Like, financially. Right? And, You know, like, what what does that say that we're talking about suicide today In 2025, on the anniversary of the 2011, January 25, burning that kind of kicked off the Arab Spring, and this, this These insights of, like, connecting these different kinds of suicides and, like, Especially the The fire and the lighting and then Arab Spring and the idea of, like, That kind of directing our attention to, like, no. This is ridiculous. Android has to stop. And we don't need suicides to say that about these systems that we're is it's just clear And so I thought I'd bring that up and see if you can ask some questions and pry it kind of helped me get at this kind of intuition that I'm getting that there's, like, a story that we can tell between the Arab Spring suicides and the suicides of the microfinance and the kind of idea of you know, we're building systems to keep us safe when the things that give us meaning are worth dying for. And that this kind of tells us something else about what life a meaningful life, is really about is that At risk, that sort of heightened state of this matters needs to have this element of, like, ultimate meaning that is beyond self preservation connected to it, which gives it this heightened state of attention, awareness, and edge, and maybe this is why those essential policies are there in that moment. Because we're like, what could be worth more than my very life? I\n\nYeah. Can we connect this to the broader argument about perception have like, using a new the old new faculty of quality and meaning And also, I'm not sure that his suicide was one that we can claim was one of, like, self sacrifice. It wasn't like Aaron Bushnell protesting the palace Design War by setting himself on fire in front of the Israeli embassy. It was more of old like, just humiliation. And being broken by a system that saw him as useless and unproductive and if only he had more money, maybe he would be worth something, and wasn't able to get money in the system because it wasn't designed in a way that helped him. And I think it's similar It's not the Not it's not the other side of the story. And I'm not sure if we have, like, better stories about this. And Can you also give more examples from history that you know of from, like, like, the femur story that show what we can really be like you know?But first, could I ask you to elaborate on:\nWhen you say \"the old new faculty of quality and meaning\" - could you share more about how you see this as both ancient and new? What makes it both?\nFor historical examples showing human potential, I could research:\nArchaeological evidence of early human care/cooperation\nIndigenous governance systems\nGift economies and non-market exchange\nAncient healing/care practices\nWhich directions feel most relevant to develop?\nLet me also propose reframing the section to focus on three aspects:\nThe Perceptual Faculty:\nHow we naturally recognize quality/meaning\nWhy this capacity got covered over\nHow it differs from rational analysis\nHistorical Evidence:\nExamples showing this faculty in action\nHow different cultures maintained it\nWhat it enables in human communities\nSystem Implications:\nHow current systems block this faculty\nWhat happens when it's honored vs ignored\nHow to design systems that support it\nBefore I draft this revision, would you share more about:\nYour understanding of this faculty as both ancient and new?\nExamples you've seen of it operating in contemporary settings?\nHow it relates to system design?\nThe goal would be to show how this perceptual faculty is both foundational to human nature and key to addressing current challenges.\n CopyRetry\nBG\nYeah. First of all, I just mean it's old, meaning it's like our birthright. We've always had it all the way back to ancient history. But that it's new and that very little attention has been paid to it or talking about it and belittled and starving artists and, like, quality is what me the numbers. Show give me the fax. Just the fax, ma'am. Historical examples. Yeah. I'd love to get some archaeological evidence and indigenous governance and yeah, Gift economies and ancient healing care practices. Things unlike with societies and villages. I feel like it's just normal to take care of your neighbors. You know? And that is rare and weird to this, like, kind of urban mechanized world where we don't know the people next door, but we're connecting them to people around the world through our phones. Through these micro snapshots of fake life on social media. Like, when was the last time you invited your neighbor? It's crazy. Yeah. So I'd love to really find the science behind the perceptual faculty like, naturally recognized quality and meaning and all the science and You know, research has been done on that and why this capacity got covered over and and how Yeah. Examples of seeing this faculty operating in contemporary settings. I think we can give the example of the the person who was in Russia and he saw 5 nuclear warheads on his radars And his system, like, notifying him of these like catastrophic bombs coming their way. And his job was to resolute and push the button and send missiles back. And he didn't because something told him not to. And I feel like We especially most Americans, are alive today and are able to have a functioning planet that isn't suffering the consequences of catastrophic nuclear war between 2 nuclear superpowers, because of the heart of 1 man. You know? That's a big deal.\n# The Birthright We Forgot: Recovering Our Capacity to See\n\nOn September 26, 1983, Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov faced a choice that would determine the fate of humanity. His early warning systems showed five nuclear missiles heading toward the Soviet Union. Protocol required immediate retaliation. Every metric, every system, every rational analysis said: Launch.\n\nBut something deeper than rationality made him hesitate. A quality he sensed but couldn't quantify told him something wasn't right. He chose to trust this perception over his instruments. We now know the warning system had malfunctioned - Petrov's choice to trust his deeper knowing quite literally saved humanity.\n\nThis capacity - to recognize quality and meaning directly - isn't new. It's our birthright, as ancient as humanity itself. Archaeological evidence shows early human communities investing enormous resources to care for injured members who couldn't contribute materially. Indigenous cultures worldwide developed sophisticated systems based on gift and reciprocity rather than pure calculation. In traditional villages, caring for neighbors wasn't charity - it was simply what it meant to be human.\n\nWhat's new isn't the capacity itself but our systematic forgetting of it. We've created a world where \"just the facts\" trumps felt knowing, where \"show me the numbers\" dismisses direct perception of quality. We've built cities where we're more connected to strangers through social media than to our next-door neighbors, where artists starve while metrics thrive.\n\nThe Science of Seeing:\nResearch increasingly validates this forgotten faculty:\n- Studies show humans naturally recognize patterns too complex to analyze rationally\n- Neural research reveals we process meaning before conscious thought\n- Social science demonstrates how gift economies created more stable societies than pure markets\n- Anthropology shows cultures worldwide developed sophisticated practices for cultivating this perception\n[Note: We should verify specific studies]\n\nThis isn't mystical or anti-rational. It's a practical capacity for recognizing quality directly, like how we know a friend is truly sad despite their smile, or how a master craftsperson knows exactly how much pressure to apply. It's the difference between measuring music and hearing it.\n\nContemporary Examples:\n- Doctors who sense when standard protocols miss something crucial\n- Teachers who recognize a student's potential beyond test scores\n- Communities that maintain human connection despite systemic pressures\n- Leaders who choose meaning over metrics even at personal cost\n\nThe cost of forgetting this faculty shows up everywhere:\n- Mental health crises despite improving living standards\n- Environmental collapse despite better measurements\n- Social isolation despite more connectivity\n- Work without meaning despite higher productivity\n\nYet this capacity remains, waiting to be recovered. Every time we recognize beauty without analysis, every time we know something is right without calculation, we touch this birthright.\n\nThe challenge isn't learning something new but remembering something fundamental:\n- Not just measuring care but creating conditions where it emerges naturally\n- Not just incentivizing cooperation but removing what blocks it\n- Not just analyzing quality but recovering our capacity to recognize it directly\n\nThis has profound implications for how we design systems:\n- What if we built organizations that trusted this knowing alongside metrics?\n- What if we created cities that enabled rather than blocked natural human connection?\n- What if we developed technologies that enhanced rather than replaced this perception?\n\nWe don't need to choose between rational analysis and direct perception of quality. Like stereoscopic vision, we need both to see depth. What we need is to remember this forgotten faculty, to trust it alongside our capacity for measurement and analysis.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. Like Petrov, we face choices where metrics alone can't guide us. Climate change, artificial intelligence, social collapse - these challenges require both precise measurement and deep recognition of quality. We need our full human capacity for knowing what matters.\nYeah. First of all, I just mean it's old, meaning it's like our birthright. We've always had it all the way back to ancient history. But that it's new and that very little attention has been paid to it or talking about it and belittled and starving artists and, like, quality is what me the numbers. Show give me the fax. Just the fax, ma'am. Historical examples. Yeah. I'd love to get some archaeological evidence and indigenous governance and yeah, Gift economies and ancient healing care practices. Things unlike with societies and villages. I feel like it's just normal to take care of your neighbors. You know? And that is rare and weird to this, like, kind of urban mechanized world where we don't know the people next door, but we're connecting them to people around the world through our phones. Through these micro snapshots of fake life on social media. Like, when was the last time you invited your neighbor? It's crazy. Yeah. So I'd love to really find the science behind the perceptual faculty like, naturally recognized quality and meaning and all the science and You know, research has been done on that and why this capacity got covered over and and how Yeah. Examples of seeing this faculty operating in contemporary settings. I think we can give the example of the the person who was in Russia and he saw 5 nuclear warheads on his radars And his system, like, notifying him of these like catastrophic bombs coming their way.

And I feel like We especially most Americans, are alive today and are able to have a functioning planet that isn't suffering the consequences of catastrophic nuclear war between 2 nuclear superpowers, because of the heart of 1 man. You know? That's a big deal.\n​​# The Science of Seeing Quality\n\nWe're taught to distrust anything that can't be measured. \"Show me the numbers,\" we say. \"Just the facts.\" Yet science increasingly reveals that our capacity to recognize quality directly isn't mystical - it's a sophisticated form of intelligence our ancestors relied on and modern life has caused us to forget.\n\nConsider three kinds of evidence:\n\nThe Science:\nNeural research shows our brains process meaning before conscious analysis. When master craftspeople know exactly how much pressure to apply, or experienced doctors sense something's wrong despite normal tests, they're not guessing - they're using pattern recognition systems more sophisticated than conscious reasoning. [Note: Need specific studies]\n\nThe History:\nArchaeological evidence shows early humans caring for injured members who couldn't contribute materially. Indigenous cultures worldwide developed gift economies and care practices that created more stable societies than pure transaction. In traditional villages, knowing your neighbors and caring for them wasn't charity - it was simply what it meant to be human.\n\nThe Stakes:\nIn 1983, when Soviet systems showed five nuclear missiles incoming, every metric told Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov to launch a counter-strike. Instead, he trusted a deeper knowing that something wasn't right. The warning system had malfunctioned - his choice to trust quality recognition over pure metrics literally saved humanity.\n\nToday we face similar stakes. Climate change, AI, social collapse - these challenges require both precise measurement and deep recognition of quality. Yet we've created a world that systematically blocks this faculty:\n- Urban designs that prevent natural community\n- Social media replacing direct human connection\n- Metrics systems that miss what matters most\n- Economic models that treat relationship as inefficient\n\nThe tragedy isn't just that we've forgotten this capacity - it's that we've built systems that actively suppress it. We connect with strangers worldwide through curated images while never speaking to our neighbors. We measure everything while recognizing less and less.\n\nYet this faculty remains our birthright. Every time we recognize beauty without analysis, every time we know something's right without calculation, we touch this ancient capacity. The challenge isn't learning something new but remembering something fundamental to being human.\nYeah. I think it's not just dislike blink, Malcolm Gladwell, sub processing. I think I'm trying to suggest that there's something profoundly deeper And connect it to our sources of meaning and recognition of truth, beauty, and goodness. That we're tapping into. And so I think that's one example, but maybe you can find other examples that might do it better. Rather than focus on this kind of intuition developed to through expertise or something that craft people have or yeah. And we at in terms of getting content for the essay? What content can you propose to me? You wanna share some studies, some research, some references to books, and people that have followed their sense of meaning and source of truth and goodness and we're Meeting beautiful lives and saw the results of That either tangibly or intangibly\nLet me explore deeper examples of this quality recognition that go beyond intuition/expertise to touch fundamental meaning and beauty. Here are some potential sources/examples to consider:\nThomas Merton's writings about contemplation and direct perception of reality - particularly how he describes moments of seeing beyond the \"container\" of rational thought to truth itself\nSimone Weil's concept of \"attention\" as a form of prayer - not just focus but a way of seeing that recognizes beauty and truth directly\nThe Sufi tradition's concept of \"witnessing\" (mushahada) - perceiving reality through the \"eye of the heart\"\nExamples from lives devoted to meaning:\nDorothy Day choosing voluntary poverty to serve others\nViktor Frankl finding meaning in concentration camps\nRachel Carson recognizing environmental truth despite industry pressure\nJane Goodall's intuitive understanding of primates that challenged scientific orthodoxy\nResearch Directions:\nStudies on awe and its effects on perception/behavior\nResearch on how exposure to beauty changes brain function\nWork on \"moral beauty\" recognition\nStudies of contemplative practices and perception\nWould you like me to:\nResearch any of these directions specifically?\nFind more examples of lives guided by this deeper recognition?\nExplore how this relates to social impact work?\nSome questions to help shape this:\nWhat examples best show this isn't just subconscious pattern recognition but connection to fundamental meaning?\nHow does this way of seeing relate to moral courage?\nWhat happens when organizations/communities honor this faculty?\nLet me know which directions feel most fruitful to explore. The goal would be to show this is about more than just intuition - it's about our capacity to recognize and align with fundamental meaning and beauty.\n Copy\nRetry\nBG\nYeah. I like this. Can you answer your questions and also these research directions. What are some researchers and research directions and papers or concepts that might be interesting for us to dig into.\nLet me explore both the questions and research directions:\nExamples showing connection to fundamental meaning beyond pattern recognition:\nBreakthrough Moments in Science:\nBarbara McClintock's \"feeling for the organism\" that led to genetic transposition discovery\nEinstein's thought experiments and visual intuitions about space-time\nJames Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis - seeing Earth as living system These weren't just expertise but moments of recognizing deeper patterns of beauty/truth\nMoral Recognition Leading to Action:\nJohn Rabe in Nanking - German businessman who, despite being Nazi party member, recognized human dignity transcending political ideology\nEugene Smith's Minamata photos - recognizing beauty in suffering led to environmental justice\nThe Danish resistance movement saving Jews - entire society recognizing human dignity over legal structures\nRelationship to moral courage: When people access this faculty, they often act with surprising courage because:\nRecognition of beauty/truth becomes more compelling than fear\nPersonal survival becomes secondary to meaning\nAction flows naturally from seeing rather than forcing\nImpact on organizations/communities: Would love to research examples of:\nHealthcare organizations that balance metrics with human dignity\nSchools that measure success through meaning not just scores\nIndigenous businesses combining profit with deeper values\nResearch Directions:\nNeuroscience:\nDavid Bohm's work on thought and perception\nResearch on \"peak experiences\" (Maslow) and brain states\nStudies on contemplative practice and perception\nWork on moral beauty recognition in the brain\nPhilosophy/Theory:\nCharles Taylor on \"strong evaluation\"\nIris Murdoch on moral perception\nMartha Nussbaum on moral beauty\nHarry Frankfurt on what we care about\nRobert Solomon on emotions as judgments\nSocial Science:\nResearch on awe and prosocial behavior\nStudies of wisdom across cultures\nWork on moral exemplars\nResearch on meaningful work and motivation\nOrganizational Studies:\nResearch on companies with strong purpose/values\nStudies of leadership and moral perception\nWork on organizational wisdom\nCases of meaning-driven innovation\nAnthropology/History:\nMarcel Mauss's work on gift economies\nResearch on traditional knowledge systems\nStudies of moral traditions across cultures\nWork on indigenous ways of knowing\nSpecific Papers/Concepts to Explore:\n\"Moral Beauty as an Overarching Judgment\" - Dachun Zhang\n\"The Intelligence of the Heart\" - Joseph Chilton Pearce\n\"Direct Perception in Broader Perspective\" - Claire Petitmengin\n\"Wisdom as Expert Knowledge System\" - Robert Sternberg\n\"The Role of Contemplative Practices in Moral Perception\" - Jake Davis\nWould you like me to:\nResearch any of these directions more deeply?\nFind more specific examples/cases?\nExplore how these connect to social impact work?\nI think combining academic research with real cases could help show:\nThis faculty is real and studiable\nIt's distinct from mere intuition\nIt has practical implications\nIt's crucial for addressing current challenges\nWhich aspects would be most helpful to develop further?\nAlso, should we look for:\nMore contemporary examples?\nMore research on how this faculty develops?\nMore practical applications?\nThe goal would be to show this isn't just philosophical but has concrete implications for how we approach change.\nYeah. Can we look for more specific examples and cases on how to connect it to social impact work? And then some contemporary examples and research on how this faculty develops. I mean, does it develop, or do we just access it?\nGreat questions. Let me explore both accessing vs developing this faculty, and how it shows up in social impact work.\nFirst, would you react to this distinction:\n\"Development\" suggests building something new\n\"Access\" suggests removing what blocks something already there\nMaybe it's both: removing blocks while building supporting conditions?\nLet me gather some specific examples:\nSocial Impact Cases:\nGrameen Bank's origin - Muhammad Yunus recognizing dignity beyond numbers\nBarefoot College - letting illiterate grandmothers become solar engineers by trusting their capacity\nCure Violence - seeing violence as health issue not crime\nWould you like me to research more examples like these?\nContemporary Examples of Accessing this Faculty:\nHealthcare workers during COVID choosing presence over protection\nEnvironmental activists recognizing rights of nature\nCommunity organizers building relationships across divides\nDo you know of other current examples?\nResearch/Practice Directions:\nHow contemplative practices affect perception\nRole of beauty/art in developing recognition\nImpact of nature exposure on quality recognition\nMethods for organizational culture shift\nBefore I gather more detailed research, could you help me understand:\nIn your experience, did this faculty need development or just access? What helped you trust it?\nHave you seen organizations successfully support this faculty? What made the difference?\nWhat blocks access to this faculty in social impact work specifically?\nOnce I have your insights, I can research more targeted examples and evidence to support what you're pointing toward.\nWould you like me to:\nResearch specific cases in any of these areas?\nLook for studies about developing vs accessing?\nFind examples of organizations supporting this faculty?\nThe goal would be to make this practical while maintaining the depth of what you're describing about fundamental meaning recognition.\n Copy\nRetry\nBG\nYeah. So I think in my life, the faculty existed. And I was just accessing it. But it was hard to trust, and it was blocked. And by my emotions and fear. Yeah. I guess organizations that prioritize beauty Like, I'm not sure if The Apple design. Team have this access or Our IDO or frog design. I'm not sure. I think this idea that it's like have to versus must do or or want to do. Blocks things. Even though half to is related to all this instrumental stuff that It's for something rather than for itself that we do to, like, show face or get results or do something instead of things that we like doing. Yeah. Can you pull out a bunch of studies that I can go look up that could be helpful? And especially studies that are looking into Kind of maybe like the immaterial nature. On this and the atemporal nature. It's relationship with Informing people about their values and their right action.\nCan we look for more specific examples and cases on how to connect it to social impact work? And then some contemporary examples and research on how this faculty develops. I mean, does it develop, or do we just access it?\nGreat questions. Let me explore both accessing vs developing this faculty, and how it shows up in social impact work.\nFirst, would you react to this distinction:\n\"Development\" suggests building something new\n\"Access\" suggests removing what blocks something already there\nMaybe it's both: removing blocks while building supporting conditions?\nLet me gather some specific examples:\nSocial Impact Cases:\nGrameen Bank's origin - Muhammad Yunus recognizing dignity beyond numbers\nBarefoot College - letting illiterate grandmothers become solar engineers by trusting their capacity\nCure Violence - seeing violence as health issue not crime\nWould you like me to research more examples like these?\nContemporary Examples of Accessing this Faculty:\nHealthcare workers during COVID choosing presence over protection\nEnvironmental activists recognizing rights of nature\nCommunity organizers building relationships across divides\nDo you know of other current examples?\nResearch/Practice Directions:\nHow contemplative practices affect perception\nRole of beauty/art in developing recognition\nImpact of nature exposure on quality recognition\nMethods for organizational culture shift\nBefore I gather more detailed research, could you help me understand:\nIn your experience, did this faculty need development or just access? What helped you trust it?\nHave you seen organizations successfully support this faculty? What made the difference?\nWhat blocks access to this faculty in social impact work specifically?\nOnce I have your insights, I can research more targeted examples and evidence to support what you're pointing toward.\nWould you like me to:\nResearch specific cases in any of these areas?\nLook for studies about developing vs accessing?\nFind examples of organizations supporting this faculty?\nThe goal would be to make this practical while maintaining the depth of what you're describing about fundamental meaning recognition.\n Copy\nRetry\nBG\nYeah. So I think in my life, the faculty existed. And I was just accessing it. But it was hard to trust, and it was blocked. And by my emotions and fear. Yeah. I guess organizations that prioritize beauty Like, I'm not sure if The Apple design. Team have this access or Our IDO or frog design. I'm not sure. I think this idea that it's like have to versus must do or or want to do. Blocks things. Even though half to is related to all this instrumental stuff that It's for something rather than for itself that we do to, like, show face or get results or do something instead of things that we like doing. Yeah. Can you pull out a bunch of studies that I can go look up that could be helpful? And especially studies that are looking into Kind of maybe like the immaterial nature. On this and the atemporal nature. It's relationship with Informing people about their values and their right action.\nLet me gather studies and research directions that explore these dimensions - particularly the relationship between accessing this faculty, values, and right action, as well as what blocks it versus what allows it to emerge:\nPotential Research Areas:\nValues and Direct Knowing:\nSchwartz's work on universal values and their recognition\nResearch on \"moral beauty\" perception\nStudies on value-guided vs fear-guided decision making\nResearch on authenticity and \"true self\" recognition\nTemporal/Atemporal Experience:\nStudies on \"peak experiences\" and time perception\nResearch on flow states and temporal awareness\nWork on contemplative practices and time sense\nStudies of indigenous time concepts\nBlocks and Access:\nResearch on fear's effect on perception\nStudies of emotional intelligence and clarity\nWork on \"defensive routines\" in organizations\nResearch on trust development\nSpecific Studies/Books to Look Up:\nOn Direct Knowing:\n\"The Master and His Emissary\" - Iain McGilchrist (on different modes of attention/knowing)\n\"Sources of the Self\" - Charles Taylor (on moral sources and modern identity)\n\"Direct Perception\" studies by Claire Petitmengin\n\"The Intelligence of the Heart\" - Joseph Chilton Pearce\nOn Values Recognition:\n\"Basic Human Values\" research by Shalom Schwartz\n\"The Nature of Human Values\" - Milton Rokeach\n\"Moral Beauty as Direct Perception\" studies\nWork on \"strong evaluation\" by Charles Taylor\nOn Organizational Implications:\nStudies on \"presencing\" by Otto Scharmer\nResearch on aesthetic leadership\nWork on \"positive organizational scholarship\"\nStudies of meaning-driven organizations\nWould you like me to:\nFind specific papers/citations within any of these areas?\nLook for more examples of organizations navigating this?\nResearch specific aspects of what blocks vs enables access?\nAlso, on your point about \"have to\" vs \"want to\":\nShould we look for research on intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation?\nStudies on autonomy and authentic action?\nWork on how organizational contexts affect this?\nYour observation about fear blocking access seems crucial. Should we specifically explore:\nHow fear affects perception/recognition\nHow organizations create/reduce fear\nPractices that help people trust this faculty despite fear\nLet me know which directions feel most relevant to develop.\n Copy\nRetry\nBG\nCan we go through and look at some of the science and maybe you can answer some of these Questions? Right now, I feel like I'm a little lost as to the next steps and I wanna get maybe, like, a first pass essay out. Maybe stop doing research now and just use what we have. So If you could find examples of organizations navigating this. And research what blocks are enabled access. And then maybe ask me 5 questions to clarify and take us to the next step.\nLet me help focus our direction. First, here are some clear examples of organizations navigating this balance between metrics and meaning:\nPatagonia - famous for decisions like \"Let My People Go Surfing,\" prioritizing environmental values even when metrics suggested otherwise\nBuurtzorg (Netherlands) - healthcare organization that eliminated middle management to let nurses trust their direct perception of patient needs, resulting in both better care and lower costs\nBarry-Wehmiller - manufacturing company that during 2008 recession chose shared sacrifice over layoffs, trusting deeper values over short-term metrics\nNow, for getting to our next steps, here are 5 key questions:\nStructure: We have several powerful elements - the Petrov story, the gardening metaphor, examples of sacrifice and meaning. How should we order these to build the argument most effectively?\nPersonal Story: You mentioned your journey from not trusting this faculty to learning to access it. Would sharing more of your personal journey help ground the theoretical parts?\nPractical Application: What specific changes in social impact work would you recommend based on this understanding? What would you do differently at Bloom?\nContemporary Crisis: How does this understanding help address current challenges like AI, climate change, social polarization? Which challenge should we focus on?\nNext Section: We have:\nCrisis in social impact\nHistorical context\nScience of seeing quality\nExamples of sacrifices/meaning\nWhich section should we develop next to move toward practical implications?\nWould you like to:\nAnswer any of these questions?\nFocus on completing one section?\nOutline the full structure?\nI think we have enough material for a strong first draft - it's more about organizing and focusing it effectively now. Which direction feels most useful?\n Copy\nRetry\nBG\nYeah. I really like those examples. And maybe we need more of that because I have a lot feelings with the counterexamples. So how about we just, like, spend some time? And if you could write maybe 5 really great examples and dig in a little. Into them about maybe some of the principal some of the facts. Some of the things that relate to some of the science that we've been looking at and the philosophy we've been thinking about. And making it applied and go really deep, you know, like, Get me 5 excellent examples and show how it relates to this idea of quality and perception, as a those 2. What makes sense. And Then we'll do 5 negative examples. And then I'll also answer your questions. I'm not sure how to order them. Can you tell me? Just give me a good idea of an order that imagine somebody that is in the social impact world Feels like have work with funders in a certain way because that's what funders are looking for and so they need to get these metrics Android order to survive. And it's like, a strategic rather than a heartfelt iOS I'm not sure. Maybe we can call this, like, the death of strategy or something and, like, why strategy is killing you? Don't know. Something like that. Yeah. Trusting the faculty to learning to access it. I'm still learning to access it. And I've actually, just now, trying more and more to really lean into it and and even to stop doing things that don't make me come alive at work and Android% trust who I am. Rather than who I want to be or wish I was, for instance. Like, you know, like, I sometimes think, like, maybe I should have apply to some tech jobs so I can make a bunch of money because my family needs And these days, I'm thinking, no. Like, I have something here. In this that keeps this question that burns within me that I ask and I wonder and I feel and I wanna write poetry and drawn It seems important. But was it to be able to feed my family? Will I be able to survive in this world? There's attention. I'm not sure. And maybe it maybe I do need some to keep me alive. I've been thinking like it a simple job. Uses my hands, but keeps my mind free. Something that will pay me less. It gives me life. Not a desk job. Something that uses my body, maybe. Something that is with people, a contribution. Something that's more humble, something that never really helps me come alive. I gotta see. Yeah. Recommendations and changes in social impact work. Getting closer people. That you work with. That having instead of, like, dashboards a narrative story about who we are as an organization, and what the world is that we see What we've Believe in it makes us feel and what we think we should do about it. And having that be like a collaboratively edited document that helps everyone get on the same page. You know, like, it might have some graphs Like, what I see is, like, people aren't really connecting with our social media. I feel like there's something weird here. Know? We need a way to be able to get what we want to do and feel, like, Inspired. Do and align around doing to touch that part of us that knows what to do and how to do it or might even just have doubts And Focus less on The tools. You know, and build tools only when we have to. Only when we get to that point where we're like, we can't not build this thing. We really shown that we you know, we're doing everything with manual calling people and connecting them and figuring out and, like, we can't remember everyone's details, and so we need to get This feedback form. But only when we have to. 2 Work on what's next. Instead of what has passed. And to have people pay for our services. And to have the customer be the person receiving the value. And our work for the people that can't afford it. To come from our charity. From the profit Yeah. I think it helps in 2 ways in the contemporary crisis. 1 is it helps people protect themselves in a sense and connect more with what matters and less with this polarized world and kind of, like, step back accelerating cycle of tension and conflict And also, 2 increase contentedness. Reducing consumption because people have a sense of meaning in life. Increasing The jobs that people do that make sense that they're connected to and connected to community through rather than what can I do to make money by blasting the world with fake AI images? That market something for me. And this idea will make clearer that AI. Cannot access the faculty of perception of quality. And that humans are required we can't build a camera. And that modality to our systems. And that we can kind of infer it. From Text. But we can never add what should we do now Because the now perception can't be brought into the machines. Climate change. These things. I think people will be inspired to start social enterprises and projects and nonprofits. That make sense and make an actual deeper, truer impact. Rather than superficially patching corporate projects. With greenwashing and fake you know, tree planting campaigns. I hope that helps. Yeah. Let's go and tell me know? Maybe 3 different trajectories for our next steps and you can give me some of your insights as to what our strongest and weakest sections are and let's move forward.\n# When Organizations Trust Quality: Five Case Studies\n\n1. Buurtzorg (Netherlands)\nWhat They Did:\n- Eliminated all middle management and metrics-based control\n- Trusted nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs\n- Organized in small, self-managing teams connected to local communities\n\nResults:\n- Better patient outcomes despite less \"efficiency\"\n- 40% lower costs than competitors\n- Highest healthcare worker satisfaction in Netherlands\n- Spread to 25 countries without traditional scaling strategy\n\nKey Insight: When you trust people's direct perception of what's needed, both meaning and metrics improve naturally.\n\n2.

Focus on meaning first, letting metrics follow\n5. Build from human dignity rather than efficiency\n\nThese organizations don't just \"balance\" metrics and meaning - they show what's possible when we trust our faculty for recognizing quality directly. They're not perfect, but they point toward a different way of organizing human activity.\n# More Organizations Living From Quality: Five Additional Case Studies\n\n1. Interface (Ray Anderson's Transformation)\nMindset/Values:\n- CEO had environmental awakening reading \"The Ecology of Commerce\"\n- Shifted from seeing business as extraction to regeneration\n- Developed \"Mission Zero\" - zero environmental impact\n- Trusted employees to innovate solutions from meaning, not metrics\n\nWhat They Did:\n- Completely redesigned carpet manufacturing\n- Let employees experiment with radical solutions\n- Shared environmental innovations with competitors\n- Focused on \"climbing Mount Sustainability\" not just profit\n\nResults:\n- Reduced environmental impact by 96%\n- Became more profitable through efficiency\n- Inspired entire industry to change\n- Created new markets through innovation\n\nKey Insight: When leadership trusts deeper perception of what's needed, impossible transformations become possible.\n\n2.

This approach works across cultures\n2. Technology can enhance rather than replace human quality recognition\n3. Scale isn't a barrier - it's about fundamental principles\n4. Different cultures find their own ways to apply these principles\n5. Success comes from trusting human capacity more than perfect systems\n# Organizations Choosing Beauty Over Strategy: A Growing Movement\n\nCurrent Strong Examples:\n1.

And maybe relatedly, we can talk about craft. And, you know, whether they're traditionally seen as jobs that are not meaningful because Manufacturing and meaningful jobs are all about jobs of the mind, but how that might not necessarily be the case. And then let's see if we can orient around these ideas of doing the right thing also means that the world is more beautiful. Not that just just financial. Sustainability, but then, like, you look at the inward and the outward is you get You know? Like, you want social impact. You want environmental stewardship and sustainability, but if you look within guess without something like\nYes - let's explore how meaning can emerge in supposedly \"mundane\" work and how inner/outer beauty align. Let me gather examples of organizations that demonstrate this:\n# Beauty in the \"Mundane\": Meaning Through Craft and Care\n\n1.

I feel like there's some sort of reintegration with self. Through the process of mindful making and reintegration with community through a apprenticeship and mastery and rethinking value by reducing waste and commoditization and embedding materiality with relationship And Even, like, the act of breaking bread like you feel the hands of the person that made it and this this all feels very beautiful, and I'm kind of interested in Yeah. More, like, diverse examples that maybe you can me think of what else I'm missing to ask you for here. Like, how does this relate to a broader Mission you know, like, what happens when you connect with that inner quality, How does Alright. Exploration of qualitative sense connect to this question of craft. And and impact and social impact. And you know, what about, like, a logic test of is this possible to be the path forward for a sustainable life, or is this all gonna be luxury products that nobody can afford? And don't we need mass automation and uncraft Bread, to be able to feed the world.# Craft as Path to Wholeness: Personal, Social, and Ecological Integration\n\n## The Integration Pattern\n\n1.

That preserve the positive impacts that we're describing in terms of relationality local sourcing, Claude. High wages for workers, meaning in the job. Sounds like some of these automation processes might be reducing that sense of meaning, but maybe not. How is it possible that a button pusher or someone monitoring machines can be also engaged in a craft. If it's possible. Could it be you know, reduced through, you know, the the set of principles of when to bring in automation and when not to. Like, if automation reduces the possibility of local sourcing or of apprentice or of connection. 2 consumers. Direct sales sounds important. So maybe we shouldn't have I don't know, like, market Thank you. Intermediary market. Right. So are the principles? What are the what are the things that we're you know, really inspired by? And, also, maybe we could expand that list as well. Like, what are the possible impacts scalable beauty based introspective apprentice connected, alive, Craft. And what are the things tha​​t we need to do to preserve that list of emergent Properties. Of that kind of business.# Principles of Living Craft: What Must Be Preserved\n\n## Emergent Properties of Living Craft\n\n1. Personal Development\n- Skill mastery\n- Quality recognition\n- Meaningful engagement\n- Personal growth\n- Pride in work\n\n2.

Economic Dignity\n- Fair compensation\n- Skill valuation\n- Direct value capture\n- Sustainable livelihoods\n- Community wealth\n\n## Foundational Elements That Create These Properties\n\n1. Direct Relationship Chains\nMUST PRESERVE:\n- Producer-consumer connection\n- Material-maker relationship\n- Teacher-learner bond\n- Community-craft link\n\nWHY:\n- Creates accountability\n- Builds meaning\n- Enables quality feedback\n- Sustains knowledge transfer\n\n2. Knowledge Development\nMUST PRESERVE:\n- Hands-on learning\n- Skill progression\n- Quality recognition\n- Problem-solving opportunities\n- Creative adaptation\n\nWHY:\n- Builds real mastery\n- Creates meaning\n- Enables innovation\n- Maintains craft knowledge\n\n3. Quality Recognition\nMUST PRESERVE:\n- Direct material contact\n- Feedback loops\n- Error recognition\n- Quality assessment\n- Craft judgment\n\nWHY:\n- Maintains standards\n- Builds understanding\n- Creates meaning\n- Enables improvement\n\n4. Local Integration\nMUST PRESERVE:\n- Community connection\n- Local material sourcing\n- Cultural relevance\n- Environmental relationship\n\nWHY:\n- Creates resilience\n- Builds meaning\n- Reduces waste\n- Maintains wisdom\n\n## Principles for Automation/Scale\n\n1. Automation Should:\n- Enhance human craft not replace it\n- Remove drudgery not skill\n- Support quality not standardize it\n- Connect people not separate them\n\n2. Technology Must:\n- Serve craft knowledge\n- Enable relationship\n- Support quality recognition\n- Enhance local connection\n\n3. Scale Through:\n- Network not hierarchy\n- Distribution not centralization\n- Relationship not transaction\n- Quality not quantity\n\n## Guidelines for Preservation\n\nWhen Considering Changes, Ask:\n\n1. Relationship Questions:\n- Does this maintain direct connections?\n- Does this enable knowledge transfer?\n- Does this support community?\n- Does this preserve culture?\n\n2. Quality Questions:\n- Does this support quality recognition?\n- Does this enable skill development?\n- Does this maintain craft judgment?\n- Does this preserve material understanding?\n\n3. Meaning Questions:\n- Does this create meaningful engagement?\n- Does this enable personal growth?\n- Does this build community?\n- Does this preserve wisdom?\n\n4. Sustainability Questions:\n- Does this support local sourcing?\n- Does this reduce waste?\n- Does this build resilience?\n- Does this maintain ecological connection?\n\n## Example: Meaningful Machine Operation\n\nA machine operator can engage in craft when:\n\n1. They Understand:\n- Whole process deeply\n- Material behavior\n- Quality indicators\n- System relationships\n\n2. They Can:\n- Make quality judgments\n- Solve complex problems\n- Teach others\n- Improve processes\n\n3. They Have:\n- Direct feedback loops\n- Learning opportunities\n- Community connection\n- Meaningful contribution\n\n4. Their Role:\n- Requires craft judgment\n- Enables skill development\n- Creates value\n- Builds understanding\n\nThis suggests automation/scale can preserve meaning when it:\n- Enhances rather than replaces human judgment\n- Creates rather than removes learning opportunities\n- Enables rather than blocks direct relationships\n- Supports rather than undermines local integration\n\nThe key is seeing automation/scale as serving craft rather than replacing it. This requires:\n- Different metrics of success\n- Different design principles\n- Different organizational models\n- Different economic relationships\n\nWhen these principles guide development, meaningful work remains possible even with technology and scale.\nWould you like me to:\nDevelop specific examples of these principles in action?\nExplore how different organizations maintain these elements?\nResearch more about meaningful machine operation?\nI think this analysis suggests technology and scale aren't inherently opposed to meaning - they just need to be guided by different principles focused on:\nEnhancing human capacity\nSupporting relationships\nEnabling quality recognition\nPreserving local connection\nShould we also explore:\nMore specific guidelines for automation decisions?\nMore examples of technology serving craft?\nMore cases of meaningful scale?\nThe key insight seems to be that preserving meaning requires seeing technology/scale as serving craft rather than replacing it. This suggests different ways of thinking about:\nProcess design\nTechnology development\nOrganizational structure\nEconomic relationships\nWould you like to develop any of these aspects further?\n CopyRetry\nBG\nWhat are the different metrics of success, design principles, organizational models, economic relationships. And is this just like a cool idea or is it something that As a facilitator of social enterprises around the world, we can direct our attention towards. Using this as Sort of call to action for a new kind of accelerator and incubator and entrepreneurship support that emphasizes craft. As kind of like a higher level approach or should we go even higher level and just talk about the emergence of beauty and talk about connecting to quality. You know, should we go super abstract? Or should we focus on this idea of craft that might be more relatable? But is it does it actually capture everything we need? And is it actually a more clear call to action for a more beautiful economic vision of the future? That we don't need to necessarily talk about sustainability and social and ecological impact. When we're talking about a craft that binds people together and ensures care for resources. I feel like that might be an interesting idea. But, I'm curious. What are the pros and cons of that approach. And also I'm curious what you think my craft is.\n# Craft as Economic Vision: From Theory to Practice\n\n## Three Possible Approaches:\n\n1.

So given everything that we have learned, can we review the facilitation process and re think. The mechanisms and the potential requirements for community and for somebody to reflect with and the principles that we were talking about in craftsmanship, like apprenticeship. Right? Like, you should have a transmission, someone that connects you I've been thinking also about, like, Joe Edelman's, values, framework, and how the attention policies that comprise your value don't necessarily all happen all at the same time that they happen at different moments, and and you realize these Thanks. That, and, And a broader thing that you appreciate Like, for instance, he used the example of deep work. There are moments where you're attending to different things, and some of them are the hard steps that may be instrumental to set up a context for deep work like carving out time or let's say your deep work involves collaboration and you just need to schedule Right? So these things are important as well. And he calls them hard steps. And then there are the Crowding out. It's the attentional policies that crowd out the other attentional policies that are possible because fear or is negative self protective sort of states And I was thinking about, like, one of the challenges that I with his work being tooth one's like if it's really a requirement sort of know what you value through your personal history or You know, he mentioned that it's like really important to get it out of your own life. It's where does it begin? Where does that start? Right? And like he sometimes says, things like, you randomly guess what might work for you Right. But I don't think that's because I think, you know, we need somehow, like, to trust and verify the context we're in and the people that were surround surrounded by initially that inspire us and to think about, like, creating more moments of exposure and job shadowing and other things like that to sort of find the person that we want to sort of have as our accompaniment. And it's either in that transmission or in the western tradition, the idea of you know, prophets and these stories of, like, the ideal human of, like, what would somebody do who didn't have these crowding out doom Moment to moment. And is it possible to have an entirely meaningful life? And, at least intentional. Right? They say the only time that the prophet wasn't remembering God was he was using the bathroom or something like that. And, and only out of respect. So I'm curious to see, do they do we update the facilitation process based on our new lessons and insights? And then, like, what is the essay? Do we need to create a new outline based on the things that we've discovered. And, yeah. How do we build quality recognition into our facilitation in in our process. And how do I write this letter? Or essay? So I can share with my colleagues at Bloom, like, what I'm really thinking about And are there, like, scalable craft based businesses that are tech empowered. You know, what do they look like? And does craft really handle all the cases for the Meaning alignment framework Right? And how does craft relate to AI?# Reimagining Facilitation: From Programs to Craft\n\n## Core Shifts Needed:\n\n1.

Can we start to draft the letter? But before we do, I think we should really think deeply about You craft And why are we talking about craft? We talked about crafts and craftsmanship because it has some of these properties of relationality to a master and Attention to detail, but those are, like, elements or methods and sort of been wondering if there's a another word or what is the collection of those elements and where else do they pop up? Because if I think if I talk about craft entrepreneurship, I might be very misunderstood. And so what are the what could could it be the right word? And if it's not, what else could it be? Yeah. Let's let's think deeply, broadly across cultures, Let's create tables to kind of look at the different factors and which ones overlap and which ones don't overlap and you know, about the quality perception and relation know, craft has that element of choiceless action kind of where, like, you're emerging, that you're also kind of in the zone and that there's continual learning and refinement progression and mastery and meaning and command and you have something to offer of tangible value when you're sharing it and you kind of know who you are and how you fit in and, you relate you relate to objects and you relate to people differently. Because of that. Right? And it's like, let's say that, you know, Minecraft is the speaking. Sure someone else could say it, but I can be proud for the uniqueness in the way that I say it. And something about, like, you know, you copy things until you become a master. And then once you're a master, then you can innovate rather than like people disrupting things when they're young and they don't actually know the principles in the foundation because like, the how of doing things informs the the why, and it comes together in, like, this kind of harmonious way. And know, this whole idea of kind of undoing lot of this industrialization and the way of thinking of people as ends kind of gets addressed in a the ductive, you know? And it's, it's It's it might not be the only way to describe it, and I'm curious if there are better ways and if you have any ideas.\nLet me summarize where we are and propose next steps for the letter to Dara and Munir:\n\nKey Elements We've Developed:\n1. Crisis in social impact (metrics over meaning)\n2. Rich examples of alternative approaches\n3. Deep analysis of craft/quality principles\n4. Framework for different way of working\n5.

              "content": "# From Metrics to Meaning: A New Vision for Social Impact\n\n## Part I: The Crisis at the Heart of Social Impact\n\nIn September 1983, Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov faced a decision that would determine humanity's fate. His early warning systems showed five nuclear missiles heading toward the Soviet Union. Every metric, every system, every rational analysis said: Launch. But something deeper than rationality made him hesitate. A quality he sensed but couldn't quantify told him something wasn't right. By trusting this deeper perception over his instruments, he saved humanity from nuclear war. We now know the warning system had malfunctioned.\n\nThis moment captures the essence of our crisis in social impact work: we've built systems that force us to trust metrics over meaning, numbers over knowing. We see this pattern playing out everywhere in our sector. Microcredit programs achieve perfect repayment rates while driving borrowers to suicide. Refugee job programs hit their targets while remaining silent when those same refugees face existential threats. Environmental initiatives count trees planted while ecosystems collapse.\n\nThe easy response is to blame bad metrics – to say we're measuring the wrong things. But what if the problem goes deeper? What if it's not just about what we measure, but about our belief that measurement alone can guide us toward what matters?\n\nI've witnessed this firsthand in my work with social enterprises. When funders ask about impact, we craft perfect narratives backed by compelling numbers. The metrics look beautiful. But something feels hollow – not because we're lying, but because we're missing something essential. We've constructed stories about impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge and speak for itself.\n\nThis isn't just about ineffective programs. It's about a way of seeing that has forgotten half of what it means to be human. Like trying to understand music purely through measuring sound waves, we've created systems that can quantify everything except what matters most.\n\n## Part II: How We Lost Our Way\n\nThe roots of this crisis run deeper than bad management or misaligned incentives. They trace back to fundamental shifts in how we understand human nature and our relationship to reality.\n\nConsider the microfinance tragedy in India. When Muhammad Yunus pioneered microcredit, he did so from direct recognition of human dignity and potential. But as the model scaled, it was filtered through a worldview that sees humans as essentially self-interested machines. Collection agents didn't see whole human beings with lives and context – they saw repayment metrics. The same collection rates that earned institutions praise were driving farmers to suicide over loans as small as $100.\n\nThis isn't an isolated case. Our entire approach to social impact emerges from what philosopher Charles Taylor calls \"instrumental reason\" – a way of seeing that reduces everything to means and ends, inputs and outputs. We've inherited this view through a long chain of thought: from Descartes' separation of mind and world, through Hobbes' vision of humans as essentially self-interested, to modern economic theories that treat people as rational maximizers of utility.\n\nThe result is social impact work that treats humans as means to ends, even when those ends are supposedly human wellbeing. We create \"user personas\" instead of knowing real people. We measure \"engagement\" instead of building genuine relationship. We track \"impact metrics\" instead of recognizing actual transformation.\n\nThe tragedy isn't just failed programs – it's that we've built systems that actively suppress our capacity to recognize and create real value. We connect with strangers worldwide through social media while never speaking to our neighbors. We measure everything while understanding less and less.\n\n## Part III: The Way Forward - Recovering Our Lost Capacity\n\nYet there's hope. All around us, we see examples of organizations and leaders who've found ways to maintain both rational analysis and deep recognition of quality. They show us what's possible when we trust our capacity to recognize meaning directly.\n\nConsider Father Greg Boyle's work with Homeboy Industries. When asked about his impact metrics, he offers something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\" This isn't avoiding accountability – it's recognizing that real impact emerges from genuine relationship, not instrumental calculation.\n\nOr look at Barry-Wehmiller, a manufacturing company that during the 2008 recession chose reduced hours for all over layoffs – starting with executives. This wasn't just ethics – it was recognition that human dignity matters more than short-term metrics. The company emerged stronger, with industry-leading retention and a culture of genuine care.\n\nThese aren't just inspiring stories – they reveal a capacity we all have but have been taught to distrust. Every time we recognize beauty without analysis, every time we know something's right without calculation, we touch this ancient way of knowing.\n\nThe path forward isn't abandoning metrics but recovering our trust in this deeper faculty. Like stereoscopic vision, we need both ways of seeing to perceive depth. What we need is organizations and approaches that honor both our capacity for measurement and our ability to recognize quality directly.\n\nThis has profound implications for how we support social enterprises. Instead of starting with metrics and working backward, we need to create conditions where meaning can emerge naturally. Instead of forcing growth through artificial incentives, we need to trust that quality creates its own kind of scale.",

              "command": "create",
              "content": "# From Metrics to Meaning: A Personal Journey to Real Impact\n\n## Part I: The Moment Everything Changed\n\nI was watching Father Greg Boyle speak about his work with gang members at Homeboy Industries when something shifted fundamentally in how I understood social impact. When asked about his metrics, his theory of change, his impact assessment, he offered something simpler and more profound: \"They're my friends.\"\n\nIn that moment, I realized how much of my own work had been instrumental – moving from community to community, project to project, always focused on scale and metrics rather than genuine relationship. I had been trying to solve problems rather than truly know people. Like many in social impact, I had unconsciously adopted a worldview that treats humans as means to ends, even when those ends are supposedly human wellbeing.\n\nThis realization led me to make a radical choice: to stop my peripatetic work and root myself deeply in Lebanon. Not because it was strategic, not because it would scale, but because real relationship requires presence. What followed transformed my understanding of what social impact truly means.\n\nOver years of building genuine relationships with refugees, former shoe-shiners, people living on the streets – many of whom are now dear friends – I learned what Father Greg already knew: real change happens through authentic connection, not programmatic intervention. When we treat people as means to achieving impact metrics, we miss what matters most.\n\n## Part II: The Crisis in Social Impact\n\nThis pattern of prioritizing metrics over meaning plays out everywhere in our sector. Consider the tragedy of microfinance in India. What began with Muhammad Yunus's recognition of human dignity devolved into a system where collection agents hounded farmers to suicide over loans as small as $100. The same repayment rates that earned institutions praise were destroying the very lives they claimed to improve.\n\nOr look at how international NGOs create thousands of refugee jobs while remaining silent when those same refugees face existential threats. The metrics look beautiful on paper, but something essential is missing. We've constructed stories about impact rather than allowing real meaning to emerge.\n\nI saw this pattern in my own work before Father Greg's words changed everything. At GEMSI, I was invited to speak on Al Jazeera about our impact. Despite our impressive metrics and frameworks, something felt inauthentic. We had built a narrative about change rather than creating conditions for real transformation.\n\nThis isn't just about ineffective programs. It's about a way of seeing that has forgotten half of what it means to be human. We've inherited a worldview that reduces everything to means and ends, inputs and outputs. From Descartes' separation of mind and world to modern economics treating humans as rational maximizers, we've built systems that actively suppress our capacity to recognize and create real value.\n\n## Part III: A Different Way of Seeing\n\nYet there's hope. My experience in Lebanon showed me what's possible when we trust relationship over metrics. When I opened my home and heart to genuine connection, transformation happened naturally. Not according to predetermined outcomes, but in ways more profound than any program could design.\n\nThis isn't just personal anecdote. Organizations worldwide are demonstrating what's possible when we trust our capacity to recognize meaning directly:\n\nConsider Barry-Wehmiller, a manufacturing company that during the 2008 recession chose reduced hours for all over layoffs – starting with executives. This wasn't just ethics – it was recognition that human dignity matters more than short-term metrics. The company emerged stronger, with industry-leading retention and a culture of genuine care.\n\nOr look at Buurtzorg in the Netherlands, which eliminated all middle management and metrics-based control in healthcare, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country.\n\nThese aren't just inspiring stories – they reveal a capacity we all have but have been taught to distrust. Every time we recognize beauty without analysis, every time we know something's right without calculation, we touch this ancient way of knowing.\n\nFor me, this realization has profound implications for how we at Bloom support social enterprises. Instead of pushing for scale and metrics first, we need to create conditions where meaning can emerge naturally. Instead of treating entrepreneurs as implementation vehicles for impact, we need to support them in building genuine relationships with their communities.\n\nThe path forward isn't abandoning metrics but recovering our trust in this deeper faculty of perception. Like stereoscopic vision, we need both ways of seeing to perceive depth. What we need are approaches that honor both our capacity for measurement and our ability to recognize quality directly.",

What we need are approaches that honor both our capacity for measurement and our ability to recognize quality directly.\n\n## Part IV: Learning from Gardens and Craft\n\nImagine two ways of growing food: a factory farm and a food forest. The factory farm operates on desperate arithmetic: this much fertilizer plus this much soil must equal this much yield and this much profit. Everything is monitored, measured, controlled. One failure in the system – a power outage, a supply chain disruption – and everything collapses.\n\nThe food forest, by contrast, is diverse, alive, resilient. Every plant, insect, and microorganism participates in countless feedback cycles too complex to measure. The gardener doesn't create the tomatoes – they create conditions where tomatoes can grow. When the tomatoes come, there's genuine joy because while the gardener planted with intention, they held that intention lightly, knowing nature ultimately decides.\n\nThis isn't just metaphor. It's a fundamentally different way of working that we see in all craft traditions. A master woodworker doesn't force the wood into shape – they understand its grain, its natural tendencies, what it wants to become. They maintain clear intention while remaining responsive to what emerges.\n\nThe modern social impact sector works more like factory farms than gardens or craft workshops. We try to manufacture predetermined outcomes through controlled interventions. We set impact targets and then force reality to conform through whatever metrics and incentives we can devise. When this fails – as it often does – we usually blame our metrics or methods rather than questioning our fundamental approach.\n\nBut what if instead of forcing outcomes, we focused on creating conditions where beautiful things can grow naturally? What if instead of treating communities as implementation sites for our theories of change, we saw them like master craftspeople see their materials – with deep respect for their inherent qualities and natural tendencies?\n\nThis isn't about abandoning intention. The gardener plants with purpose; the craftsperson shapes with vision. But they do so with profound respect for the natural qualities of what they're working with. They succeed not by forcing their will but by aligning their intentions with the inherent tendencies of their materials.\n\nI've seen this work in practice. When I finally stopped trying to create programs to \"fix\" things in Lebanon and instead focused on building genuine relationships, something remarkable happened. The very outcomes we had been trying to force began emerging naturally. Not according to our timelines or metrics, but in ways more sustainable and meaningful than we could have designed.\n\nThis is what craftspeople have always known: when you align with the inherent qualities of your materials – whether wood, clay, or human communities – you create conditions where beautiful things can emerge naturally. You might have clear intention to make a bowl or grow tomatoes, but you hold that intention lightly, remaining responsive to what actually wants to emerge.\n\nConsider traditional Japanese pottery. The potter doesn't just impose form on clay – they develop an intimate understanding of the clay's properties, the kiln's temperament, the glaze's tendencies. Success comes not from controlling these elements but from understanding them so deeply that working with them becomes like a dance.\n\nThis way of working requires profound patience and humility. You can't rush a garden or force craft. But paradoxically, this slower, more responsive approach often creates more sustainable results than our attempts to force outcomes through metrics and control systems.\n\nIn social impact work, this might mean:\n- Building genuine relationships before designing programs\n- Letting solutions emerge from community wisdom rather than imposing external models\n- Measuring what actually emerges rather than forcing predetermined outcomes\n- Creating conditions for natural growth rather than manufacturing scale\n\nThe key shift is from seeing communities as implementation sites for our impact theories to seeing them like a gardener sees soil or a craftsperson sees their materials – with deep respect for their inherent qualities and natural tendencies to grow toward beauty.",
