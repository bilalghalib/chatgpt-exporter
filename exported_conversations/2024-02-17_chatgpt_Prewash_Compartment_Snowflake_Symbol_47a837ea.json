      "content": "For pre-washing your white button-up shirts, both bicarbonate de sodium (baking soda) and percarbonate de sodium (sodium percarbonate) are effective options. Here's how you can use them:\n\n1. **Bicarbonate de Sodium (Baking Soda):** \n   - Dissolve half a cup of baking soda in water.\n   - Soak the shirt in this solution for an hour before washing. \n   - Baking soda helps in removing odors and light stains, and it can also make whites whiter.\n\n2. **Percarbonate de Sodium (Sodium Percarbonate):**\n   - Mix a small amount of sodium percarbonate with water to create a paste.\n   - Apply this paste directly to any stains or heavily soiled areas. \n   - Leave it for some time before washing. \n   - Sodium percarbonate is a great stain remover and can brighten whites.\n\nFor the washing machine settings:\n\n- **Temperature:** Use a warm setting, as hot water can shrink or damage the fabric, while cold water might not effectively clean the shirt.\n- **Cycle:** Choose a gentle or delicate cycle to prevent wear and tear on the fabric.\n- **Detergent:** Use a high-quality detergent suitable for whites. If your water is hard, consider adding a water softener.\n\nAlways check the care label on your shirts for specific washing instructions. Some materials or finishes might require special care.",

      "content": "Yes, using a prewash can be very effective, especially for white shirts that are prone to stains or have areas of heavy soiling. For the prewash, you can use either the bicarbonate de sodium (baking soda) or the percarbonate de sodium (sodium percarbonate), as mentioned earlier. Here's how to use them in a prewash:\n\n1. **Bicarbonate de Sodium (Baking Soda) for Prewash:**\n   - Add about half a cup of baking soda to the prewash compartment of your washing machine.\n   - Baking soda helps in removing odors and can assist in loosening stains before the main wash.\n\n2. **Percarbonate de Sodium (Sodium Percarbonate) for Prewash:**\n   - Add a small amount of sodium percarbonate to the prewash compartment. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for the amount.\n   - It's particularly effective for stain removal and for brightening whites.\n\nBoth options will help to tackle stains and enhance the overall cleaning in the main wash cycle. Remember, it's always good to check the care labels on your garments for any specific washing instructions or warnings.",

They are where you add the detergent for the main washing cycle.\n\n2. **Snowflake Looking Thing:** This symbol is likely to represent the prewash compartment. The prewash compartment is used for adding detergent or a prewash treatment (like bicarbonate de sodium or percarbonate de sodium) before the main wash. This compartment is used when you select a prewash cycle on your machine, allowing the treatment to work on the clothes before the main wash cycle starts.\n\nYou should add your prewash treatment (bicarbonate de sodium or percarbonate de sodium) to the compartment with the snowflake symbol. Then, add your regular detergent to the compartment marked with a '1' or '2' for the main wash cycle. Always ensure to follow the instructions provided by your washing machine's manufacturer for the best results.",

      "content": "In many washing machines, including Valberg models, the compartments labeled '1' and '2' in the detergent drawer are for different purposes:\n\n1. **Compartment 1 (labeled '1'):** This is usually the prewash compartment. It's where you add detergent if you're using a prewash cycle. This compartment is used to apply a short wash or rinse before the main wash cycle, which is helpful for heavily soiled clothes.\n\n2. **Compartment 2 (labeled '2'):** This is the main wash detergent compartment. It's where you put the detergent for the main wash cycle.\n\nGiven this standard layout, if you're doing a prewash for your white shirts, you should put your prewash agent (like bicarbonate de sodium or percarbonate de sodium) in compartment 1. Then, add your regular laundry detergent in compartment 2 for the main wash.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to consult the user manual for your specific model, as the configuration can vary slightly between different washing machines. If you don't have the manual, you might be able to find it online by searching for your specific Valberg model.",

If your machine uses water in the prewash cycle immediately upon starting, the sodium percarbonate will dissolve and begin acting on the stains and soiled areas.\n\n3. **Proceed with Washing:** After adding it to the prewash compartment, you can start the washing cycle as usual. The prewash cycle will help to loosen and remove stains before the main wash.\n\nSodium percarbonate works well in warm water, as the warmth helps it to dissolve and activate more effectively.
