  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is developing a platform called Cursive, which focuses on structured group reflection and journaling practices. The conversation centered on a critical naming and conceptual challenge: finding the right term for instances of book templates (currently called \"cohorts\" in the database). The platform's architecture involves books as templates containing prompts, which can be instantiated multiple times with different groups of people and timeframes - similar to putting a game cartridge into a system to create different playthroughs.\n\nThe user expressed dissatisfaction with \"cohort\" as terminology, finding it too academic and unclear for users. They explored various alternatives including \"run,\" \"session,\" \"circle,\" \"practice,\" and \"playbook.\" Through creative exercises, we examined how different thought leaders like Steve Jobs, Buster Benson, and Brett Victor might approach the naming challenge, and imagined how the terminology might evolve into common language usage. The user discovered that \"circle\" was already taken by Circle.so, a major community platform offering courses, discussions, and events, which eliminated that option.\n\nThe conversation revealed deeper philosophical tensions about what distinguishes Cursive from existing course and community platforms. The user articulated an aspirational vision focused on returning to physical, embodied writing practices and creating spaces for slower, more thoughtful conversation. They positioned their platform as resistance to digital acceleration, aiming to resurrect extinct forms of human connection like correspondence culture, salon traditions, and commonplace books. The user emphasized optimizing for depth over speed, presence over productivity, and creating physical artifacts rather than just consuming digital content. This led to exploring terminology that captures the counter-cultural stance of prioritizing slowness, analog sensibilities, and collective meaning-making over efficiency-focused digital interactions.",

I've:\n\n  1. ✅ Created database migration with all tables (books, prompts, cohorts, posts, responses, witnesses, gatherings, curations)\n  2. ✅ Updated TypeScript types with complete interfaces\n  3. ✅ Rewrote the groupJournalService with new schema\n  4. ✅ Applied the migration to the database\n\n  The API endpoints at /api/books already exist and will work with the updated service. The database is ready and the backend service layer is\n  complete.\n\n  Next steps are to build the UI flows.

All tables are created. Now let me address your questions:\n\n  /books/new - What's it for?\n\n  The /books/new page is where authors create new books (guided experiences). Think of it like Teachable's course creation page:\n  - Author designs a book (e.g., \"Questions from Bilal\")\n  - Adds 12 prompts (questions)\n  - Configures schedule, settings\n  - Publishes it\n\n  Then hosts can create cohorts from that book at /books/[id]/cohorts/new\n\n  ---\n  Collaborative Notebooks & Responses\n\n  Current Setup (No Real-time Collaboration in Responses)\n\n  Current design: Each person submits their own individual response to each prompt.\n  - Monday: Prompt opens\n  - Monday-Sunday: Everyone writes their own response privately\n  - Next Monday: All responses revealed to cohort (if they chose to share)\n  - Then: People leave witness notes on each other's responses\n\n  Pros:\n  - ✅ Simple - no conflict resolution needed\n  - ✅ Individual reflection first, then collective wisdom\n  - ✅ Proof of work per person (time tracking, keystroke data)\n  - ✅ Each person's voice preserved\n  - ✅ No \"loudest person dominates\" problem\n\n  Cons:\n  - ❌ No real-time co-creation\n  - ❌ Feels isolated during writing phase\n  - ❌ Can't build on each other's ideas immediately\n\n  Real-time Collaborative Option\n\n  For the writing phase (Monday-Sunday before reveal):\n  You COULD enable real-time collaboration where cohort members write one collective response together.\n\n  Technical Setup (Already exists in your codebase!):\n  - stroke_events table - for real-time drawing strokes\n  - text_events table - for cursor/selection sync\n  - notebook_presence table - who's active\n\n  How it would work:\n  1. Post opens Monday\n  2. Cohort gets one shared \"response canvas\"\n  3. Everyone can see each other typing/drawing in real-time\n  4. Operational transform for text conflicts\n  5. Sunday: Submit the collective response as one artifact\n\n  Pros:\n  - ✅ True co-creation\n  - ✅ Build on each other's ideas live\n  - ✅ More engaging, less lonely\n  - ✅ Emergent insights from collision\n\n  Cons:\n  - ❌ Complex - need OT, conflict resolution\n  - ❌ Scheduling hell (12 people need to be online together)\n  - ❌ Loud voices dominate\n  - ❌ Can't track individual proof-of-work\n  - ❌ Some people like to write alone first\n\n  ---\n  Solution Forward: Hybrid Model\n\n  Best of both worlds:\n\n  1. Individual Responses (Default)\n    - Each person writes their own response (current design)\n    - Private until reveal time\n    - Time-tracked, keystroke data\n  2. Opt-in Collaborative Spaces\n    - Add a \"Start Collaborative Session\" button\n    - Host or any member can create a shared canvas\n    - Uses real-time collab tables (stroke_events, text_events)\n    - This becomes a \"scratch pad\" for the cohort\n    - NOT submitted as the final response\n    - Used for: brainstorming, discussing during monthly salon, building on each other's ideas\n  3. Individual Submit + Collective Artifact\n    - Everyone still submits their own response (required)\n    - Optional: Collaborative canvas gets archived as \"Cohort Notes for Week 5\"\n    - Both preserved in final book\n\n  Implementation:\n  - Keep current response model (individual)\n  - Add /cohorts/[id]/collaborate route\n  - Uses existing real-time tables\n  - Saved as separate artifact type (not a response)\n\n  This way:\n  - ✅ Individual reflection preserved\n  - ✅ Collective co-creation available\n  - ✅ No forced synchronous time\n  - ✅ Proof of work intact\n  - ✅ Both solo and social needs met\n\n  Should I build the individual response flow first (simpler, MVP), or do you want the collaborative canvas feature from the start?\n\n⏺ Good questions! Let me clarify:\n\n  What's /books/new for?\n\n  /books/new is where authors create book templates. Example flow:\n\n  1. Bilal goes to /books/new\n    - Title: \"Questions from Bilal - Year One\"\n    - Adds 12 prompts (questions)\n    - Config: weekly, 4 passes, allow community prompts\n    - Publishes book\n  2. Anyone can then create a cohort from that book\n    - Go to /books/bilal-questions (custom landing page)\n    - Click \"Start a Cohort\"\n    - Pick start date, max members, price\n    - Get join code, invite people\n\n  Think: Notion templates (books) vs Notion workspaces (cohorts)\n\n  ---\n  Do we have real-time collaboration tables?\n\n  YES! Your database already has:\n  - stroke_events - real-time drawing\n  - text_events - cursor/selection sync\n  - notebook_presence - who's online\n\n  From the September 2025 migration (20250928073603_add_strokes_to_pages.sql)\n\n  ---\n  Collaborative vs Individual Responses\n\n  Current Design Decision Needed:\n\n  Option A: Individual Responses (Simpler, Better for Reflection)\n\n  Each person writes their own response privately:\n  Monday: Prompt opens\n  ↓\n  Monday-Sunday:\n    - You write your response (auto-saves)\n    - Time tracked, keystroke data\n    - No one sees it yet\n  ↓\n  Next Monday: Responses revealed to cohort\n  ↓\n  Everyone reads, leaves witness notes\n\n  Pros:\n  - ✅ Individual reflection time (deep thinking, not reactive)\n  - ✅ Proof of work per person (time tracking works)\n  - ✅ Shy people can think before sharing\n  - ✅ No scheduling conflicts (write whenever)\n  - ✅ Simpler to build (no conflict resolution)\n\n  Cons:\n  - ❌ Feels isolated during writing\n  - ❌ Can't build on each other's ideas immediately\n  - ❌ No spontaneous co-creation\n\n  ---\n  Option B: Collaborative Response (Complex, More Social)\n\n  Whole cohort writes one shared response together:\n  Monday: Prompt opens\n  ↓\n  Monday-Sunday:\n    - Shared canvas (like Google Docs)\n    - See each other typing/drawing in real-time\n    - Build on ideas together\n  ↓\n  Sunday: Submit the ONE collective response\n  ↓\n  Next week: Move to next prompt\n\n  Pros:\n  - ✅ True co-creation\n  - ✅ More engaging, less lonely\n  - ✅ Emergent insights from collision\n  - ✅ Builds cohort bonds faster\n\n  Cons:\n  - ❌ Scheduling hell (need to be online together)\n  - ❌ Loud voices dominate\n  - ❌ Can't track individual effort\n  - ❌ Operational transform complexity\n  - ❌ What if someone writes at 2am?\n\n  ---\n  Solution Forward: Hybrid (Best of Both)\n\n  My recommendation:\n\n  1. Individual Responses (Core Flow)\n    - Each person submits their own response\n    - Private until reveal\n    - This is the primary practice\n  2. Add Optional \"Cohort Workspace\"\n    - Button: \"Open Collaborative Space\"\n    - Real-time shared canvas (uses existing tables)\n    - Used for: brainstorming, salon prep, building on ideas\n    - NOT submitted as the response (just scratch pad)\n    - Archived as \"Week 5 Cohort Notes\"\n  3. Final Book Contains Both\n    - Individual responses (curated)\n    - Collaborative notes (optional)\n\n  Implementation:\n  /cohorts/[id]/current          → My individual response\n  /cohorts/[id]/collaborate      → Shared workspace (real-time)\n\n  This way:\n  - ✅ Individual reflection preserved\n  - ✅ Collective co-creation available\n  - ✅ No forced sync time (write alone OR together)\n  - ✅ Proof of work intact\n  - ✅ Uses existing real-time tables\n\n  ---\n  What Should We Build First?\n\n  For MVP (next 2 weeks):\n\n  1. ✅ Database schema (done)\n  2. ✅ Service layer (done)\n  3. 📝 /books/new - Create book templates\n  4. 📝 /books/[id]/cohorts/new - Start cohorts\n  5. 📝 /cohorts/[id]/current - Individual response interface\n  6. 📝 Basic witness notes\n\n  Phase 2 (later):\n  - /cohorts/[id]/collaborate - Real-time workspace\n  - Custom landing pages\n  - Curations/library\n\n  My vote: Build individual responses first. Simpler, proven pattern (Franklin's Junto was async!), and we can add collaborative features after\n  validating the core loop.\n\n  What do you think? Individual first, or collaborative from the start?\n\n> ok, that's for books, how about if we just wanted to write a pge of notes, i guess we create a journal notebook first? or maybe that's the other \nthing the are automatically in their libray, what's a good first set of starter books? \n\n⏺ Great question! Let me clarify the mental model:\n\n  Two Systems in Cursive\n\n  1. Notebooks (Personal Thinking Space)\n  - Already exists in your app\n  - /notebooks/[id] - Your private canvas for notes, drawings, thoughts\n  - Just you, no cohort, no schedule\n  - Uses the pages table with overlays and strokes\n\n  2. Books/Cohorts (Structured Group Practice)\n  - New system we're building\n  - Scheduled prompts, cohorts, responses, witnesses\n  - Social, time-bound, guided\n\n  You're right - if someone just wants to write notes, they use notebooks (already built), not books.\n\n  ---\n  Starter Books in Library\n\n  When someone signs up, we could auto-add books to their library (like Notion templates). Here are good starter books:\n\n  1. \"Morning Pages\" (Simple Entry Point)\n\n  - Prompts: 1 recurring prompt: \"What's on your mind this morning?\"\n  - Schedule: Daily, 30 days\n  - Config: Solo practice (cohort of 1), no witnesses needed\n  - Why: Dead simple, builds habit, onboarding\n\n  2. \"Weekly Review\" (GTD-style)\n\n  - Prompts:\n    a. \"What did you complete this week?\"\n    b. \"What did you learn?\"\n    c. \"What's most important next week?\"\n  - Schedule: Weekly on Sunday, ongoing\n  - Config: Solo or small groups (2-5)\n  - Why: Reflection practice, popular pattern\n\n  3. \"Questions from Bilal - Year One\" (Your Flagship)\n\n  - Prompts: 12 questions × 4 passes\n  - Schedule: Weekly, 48 weeks\n  - Config: 12 people max, $200, witnesses required\n  - Why: Your IP, showcases full platform\n\n  4. \"30-Day Writing Sprint\"\n\n  - Prompts:\n    - Week 1: \"Write about a vivid memory\"\n    - Week 2: \"Describe a place you love\"\n    - Week 3: \"Write a letter to your future self\"\n    - Week 4: \"Reflect on the month\"\n  - Schedule: Weekly, 4 weeks\n  - Config: 5-10 people, free or paid\n  - Why: Shows you can create short cohorts\n\n  5. \"Letter to a Friend\" (Minimal)\n\n  - Prompts: 1 prompt: \"Write a letter to someone who matters\"\n  - Schedule: One-time\n  - Config: Solo\n  - Why: Proves single-prompt books work\n\n  ---\n  Library UX\n\n  When user signs up:\n\n  /library or /books\n  ├── 📚 My Books (books you created)\n  ├── 📖 My Cohorts (cohorts you're in)\n  ├── ✨ Starter Templates (auto-added)\n  │   ├── Morning Pages (Solo)\n  │   ├── Weekly Review (Solo/Small Group)\n  │   └── 30-Day Writing Sprint (Group)\n  └── 🌍 Public Library (browse all published books)\n      ├── Questions from Bilal (Featured)\n      └── [Other authors' books]\n\n  First-run experience:\n  1. Sign up → See starter templates\n  2. Click \"Morning Pages\" → Auto-create cohort (solo, starts today)\n  3. Go to /cohorts/[id]/current → See today's prompt\n  4. Write response → Done\n\n  ---\n  So the Flow is:\n\n  For personal notes (no structure):\n  → /notebooks/[id] (already exists)\n\n  For guided practice (with prompts):\n  → Create/join a cohort from a book\n  → /cohorts/[id]/current\n\n  Starter books we should seed:\n  1. Morning Pages (daily, solo)\n  2. Weekly Review (weekly, solo/small)\n  3. 30-Day Sprint (weekly, group)\n  4. Letter to a Friend (one-time, solo)\n  5. Questions from Bilal (your flagship)\n\n  Should I:\n  1. Create a seed script for these 5 starter books?\n  2. Build the library page (/library) to show them?\n  3. Add \"Start Solo Cohort\" button (auto-creates cohort with just you)?\n\n> what's something cute and cool we can do with the journal sort of like what we're doing with teh collaborative book/print thing \n\n⏺ Cute & Cool Journal Features (Like the Printed Book, but Personal)\n\n  1. \"Time Capsule\" - Send to Future Self\n\n  Concept: Write a page, seal it, it unlocks in 6 months/1 year\n  - Lock icon appears on the page\n  - Can't edit or view until unlock date\n  - Get email notification when it unlocks\n  - See who you were vs who you are now\n\n  Visual: Wax seal animation, vintage envelope aesthetic\n\n  ---\n  2. \"Page-a-Day Calendar\" - Physical Tear-Off Printable\n\n  Concept: Your year of notes becomes a desk calendar\n  - Each page = one day\n  - Auto-generates PDF with:\n    - Day/date at top\n    - Your drawing/note from that day\n    - Quote or reflection you wrote\n  - Print it, tear off daily like those quote calendars\n  - Blackwing aesthetic (clean, minimal, quality paper feel)\n\n  Visual: Perforated edge, day number in corner, your handwriting\n\n  ---\n  3. \"Postcard Mode\" - Send Pages to Friends\n\n  Concept: Turn any notebook page into a mailed postcard\n  - Draw/write something\n  - Click \"Send as Postcard\"\n  - Pick friend's address\n  - We print & mail it (via Lob API)\n  - They get your actual handwriting/drawing in mail\n  - Cost: $2-3/postcard\n\n  Visual: Postcard template overlay, stamp in corner, handwritten address\n\n  ---\n  4. \"Scrapbook Stitching\" - Monthly Compilation\n\n  Concept: Every month, auto-compile your pages into a mini zine\n  - Last day of month: \"Your October is ready\"\n  - 8-16 pages selected (you choose or AI picks best)\n  - PDF formatted as printable zine (fold & staple)\n  - Print at home or order printed copy\n  - Feels like a monthly personal magazine\n\n  Visual: Zine fold template, staple marks, tactile feel\n\n  ---\n  5. \"Ghost Pages\" - See Your Past Self Writing\n\n  Concept: Overlay your old entries while writing new ones\n  - Writing today, see faint ghost of what you wrote on this date last year\n  - Toggle on/off\n  - Shows patterns, evolution, recurring thoughts\n  - Like carbon paper/palimpsest effect\n\n  Visual: Translucent overlay, old ink fading through new\n\n  ---\n  6. \"Binding Ceremony\" - Annual Book Ritual\n\n  Concept: End of year, your journal becomes a physical book (like cohorts)\n  - January 1st: \"Your 2025 journal is ready to bind\"\n  - Select pages to include (or include all)\n  - Choose cover design\n  - We print & bind it\n  - Ships with note: \"365 days of thinking\"\n  - Keep on shelf next to 2024, 2023...\n\n  Visual: Leather-bound aesthetic, year embossed on spine\n\n  ---\n  7. \"Margin Echoes\" - AI Finds Patterns Over Time\n\n  Concept: AI reads your journal, leaves margin notes about patterns\n  - \"You've written about this 7 times this year\"\n  - \"This thought appeared first in March, returned in July, now again\"\n  - \"This drawing style emerged after your trip in May\"\n  - Not prompts/suggestions, just observation\n  - Feels like a thoughtful reader, not a chatbot\n\n  Visual: Pencil margin notes, arrows connecting related entries\n\n  ---\n  8. \"Prompt Roulette\" - Daily Surprise Question\n\n  Concept: Each morning, random prompt appears in your journal\n  - Pull from different traditions (same 12 from Bilal's book)\n  - But randomized, not structured\n  - Optional: answer it or ignore\n  - If you answer, it tracks how your answers to same question evolve\n  - Solo version of the cohort practice\n\n  Visual: Slot machine/fortune cookie reveal animation\n\n  ---\n  9. \"Thread Finder\" - Auto-Connect Related Pages\n\n  Concept: As you write, AI finds related past entries\n  - \"This connects to your page from June 12\"\n  - Click to see side-by-side\n  - Manual: drag line between pages to link them\n  - Over time, your journal becomes a web of ideas\n  - Visual graph view of connections\n\n  Visual: Red thread connecting pages (like conspiracy board)\n\n  ---\n  10. \"Proof of Presence\" - Beautiful Time Report\n\n  Concept: End of month/year, visual report of your practice\n  - \"You spent 47 hours thinking this year\"\n  - Heatmap of active days\n  - Most-edited page\n  - Drawing vs writing ratio\n  - NOT productivity tracking, presence tracking\n  - Celebrate showing up, not output\n\n  Visual: Constellation map, each day a star\n\n  ---\n  My Top Pick: \"Binding Ceremony\" + \"Page-a-Day Calendar\"\n\n  Why these two:\n\n  1. Binding Ceremony = Your journal version of the cohort's printed book\n    - Same satisfaction of physical artifact\n    - Annual ritual (New Year's gift to yourself)\n    - Shelf of years = visual proof of practice\n  2. Page-a-Day Calendar = Daily delight\n    - Your own words/drawings greet you each morning\n    - Tangible, analog, desk presence\n    - Gift-able (print calendar of your year for mom)\n\n  Implementation:\n  - Both use same PDF generation logic as cohort books\n  - Binding uses print-on-demand (Lulu/Blurb)\n  - Calendar uses simpler template print\n\n  Combo effect:\n  - January 1: Order your 2025 bound journal + 2026 calendar\n  - Every year, two artifacts arrive\n  - Journals on shelf, calendar on desk\n  - Physical record of thinking life\n\n  Which of these feels most exciting to you? Or should we combine a few?\n\n> postcard mode is awesome and binding ceremony can be interesting way to keep a streak of journaling if you don't you don't get bound? - these don't \nsound like the starter bookshelf though they sound like nice products i could build on my platform haha \n\n⏺ OH! You're absolutely right - I conflated two different things:\n\n  You're asking about: Starter Books for the Group Journal Platform\n\n  Not features for personal notebooks. These are templates people can use to start cohorts.\n\n  ---\n  Good Starter Bookshelf (for /library)\n\n  1. \"Morning Pages\" - Solo Daily Practice\n\n  - What: Julia Cameron's classic - 3 pages, stream of consciousness\n  - Prompts: 1 recurring: \"What's on your mind?\"\n  - Schedule: Daily, 30 days\n  - Cohort: Solo (just you)\n  - Why starter: Lowest barrier, builds habit, popular\n\n  2. \"Weekly Reflection\" - Solo Weekly Practice\n\n  - Prompts:\n    a. \"What surprised me this week?\"\n    b. \"What did I learn?\"\n    c. \"What's calling me forward?\"\n  - Schedule: Weekly on Sunday, 12 weeks\n  - Cohort: Solo or duo\n  - Why starter: Reflection without commitment, 3 months\n\n  3. \"Book Club Questions\" - Small Group Practice\n\n  - Prompts: Generic book discussion questions (5-8)\n  - Schedule: Weekly, 6-8 weeks\n  - Cohort: 4-8 people\n  - Why starter: People already do book clubs, this digitizes it\n\n  4. \"Gratitude Circle\" - Simple Group Practice\n\n  - Prompts:\n    a. \"What are you grateful for this week?\"\n    b. \"Who made your week better?\"\n    c. \"What moment will you remember?\"\n  - Schedule: Weekly, 4 weeks\n  - Cohort: 3-12 people\n  - Why starter: Positive, simple, short commitment\n\n  5. \"Letter Exchange\" - One-Shot with Partner\n\n  - Prompts: 1 prompt: \"Write a letter to your partner in this exchange\"\n  - Schedule: One-time\n  - Cohort: 2 people (you + 1)\n  - Why starter: Minimal, shows the witness feature, pen pal vibes\n\n  ---\n  And YES - Those Other Ideas are Separate Products!\n\n  For personal notebooks (individual features):\n  - 📮 Postcard Mode - mail your drawings ($3/card)\n  - 📚 Binding Ceremony - annual journal book ($40)\n  - 📅 Page-a-Day Calendar - desk calendar ($25)\n  - 👻 Ghost Pages - see past entries overlaid\n  - 🧵 Thread Finder - auto-connect related pages\n\n  These could be:\n  - Premium features (Cursive Pro)\n  - One-off purchases\n  - Physical goods shop\n  - Separate from the group journal platform\n\n  ---\n  So the Question is:\n\n  What should the default \"starter books\" be when someone first sees /library?\n\n  My vote:\n  1. Morning Pages (solo, 30 days) - \"Start practicing alone\"\n  2. Weekly Reflection (solo, 12 weeks) - \"Deepen your practice\"\n  3. Gratitude Circle (3-6 people, 4 weeks) - \"Invite a few friends\"\n  4. Letter Exchange (2 people, one-time) - \"Try with one person\"\n  5. Questions from Bilal (12 people, 48 weeks, $200) - \"The full experience\"\n\n  Progressive difficulty: solo → duo → small group → full cohort\n\n  Should I create a seed script for these 5 books?\n\n> i think notebooks might be better ported as a first book, it can be called a notebook, they can have a template called notebook, or make it clearer /\n easier so people can make a notebook for biology a notebook for etc and not need it to be in a different place, they can organize the library to put \nnotebooks in a certain location, os is it better to have the separate? \n\n⏺ This is a GREAT architectural question. Let me think through it:\n\n  Option A: Notebooks ARE Books (Unified System)\n\n  Everything is a book:\n  - \"Notebook\" is just a book with 0 prompts (blank pages)\n  - \"Biology Notes\" = book with config: { type: 'notebook', blank_pages: true }\n  - \"Morning Pages\" = book with 1 recurring prompt\n  - \"Questions from Bilal\" = book with 12 prompts × 4 passes\n\n  User creates cohort of 1 (solo) for everything:\n  - Solo cohort for Biology Notes\n  - Solo cohort for Morning Pages\n  - Group cohort for Questions from Bilal\n\n  Library view:\n  /library\n  ├── 📓 My Notebooks (cohorts with blank books)\n  │   ├── Biology Notes\n  │   ├── Work Journal\n  │   └── Personal Diary\n  ├── 📖 My Practices (cohorts with prompts)\n  │   ├── Morning Pages (solo)\n  │   └── Weekly Reflection (solo)\n  └── 👥 My Cohorts (group cohorts)\n      └── Questions from Bilal (12 people)\n\n  Pros:\n  - ✅ One system to maintain\n  - ✅ Everything gets same features (drawings, time tracking, search)\n  - ✅ Can add prompts to a notebook later (\"turn this into a guided journal\")\n  - ✅ Cleaner codebase\n\n  Cons:\n  - ❌ Conceptual overhead (\"Why do I need a cohort for my notes?\")\n  - ❌ More complex for simple use case\n  - ❌ Database bloat (cohort for every notebook)\n\n  ---\n  Option B: Keep Notebooks Separate (Current Architecture)\n\n  Two systems:\n  - notebooks table → Personal notes, no structure\n  - books/cohorts table → Guided practices with prompts\n\n  User flow:\n  - Want blank pages? → Create notebook\n  - Want guided practice? → Create/join cohort from book\n\n  Navigation:\n  /notebooks → My personal notebooks\n  /library → Guided journals & cohorts\n\n  Pros:\n  - ✅ Simpler mental model (notes vs practices)\n  - ✅ Lighter weight for casual users\n  - ✅ Already built and working\n\n  Cons:\n  - ❌ Two systems to maintain\n  - ❌ Can't easily convert notebook → guided practice\n  - ❌ Features diverge over time\n\n  ---\n  Option C: Hybrid (Notebooks as a Book Template)\n\n  Notebooks table stays, but also create \"Blank Notebook\" book template:\n\n  1. Quick path: /notebooks/new → Creates traditional notebook (current system)\n  2. Power path: Use \"Blank Notebook\" book → Create solo cohort → Same result but with cohort features\n\n  User sees:\n  /library\n  ├── ⚡ Quick Start\n  │   └── [New Notebook] → creates traditional notebook\n  ├── 📚 Templates\n  │   ├── Blank Notebook (book with 0 prompts)\n  │   ├── Morning Pages\n  │   └── Questions from Bilal\n  └── 📂 My Notebooks & Cohorts\n      ├── Biology Notes (traditional notebook)\n      └── Morning Pages Practice (solo cohort)\n\n  Pros:\n  - ✅ Keep simple path for casual users\n  - ✅ Power users can use cohort system\n  - ✅ Gradual migration possible\n\n  Cons:\n  - ❌ Still maintaining two systems\n  - ❌ Confusing that two things do same thing\n\n  ---\n  My Recommendation: Option A - Unify Everything\n\n  Here's why:\n\n  1. Notebooks ARE just blank books\n    - Config: { blank_pages: true, auto_create_pages: true }\n    - No prompts needed\n    - Solo cohort (max_members: 1)\n  2. Simpler for users once they get it:\n    - \"Everything lives in my library\"\n    - \"Some have prompts, some don't\"\n    - \"Some are solo, some are group\"\n  3. Unlocks cool features:\n    - Add prompts to any notebook later\n    - Invite someone to co-write a notebook (→ becomes 2-person cohort)\n    - Turn Biology Notes into \"Study Group\" (→ becomes group cohort)\n    - Same binding ceremony works for all\n  4. The \"cohort\" abstraction disappears:\n    - Don't call it \"cohort\" in UI\n    - Call it \"workspace\" or just hide it\n    - User creates \"Biology Notes\" → Behind scenes: book + solo cohort\n    - They never see \"cohort\" unless they invite someone\n\n  UI Language:\n  \"New Notebook\" button → Creates blank book + solo cohort\n  \"New Practice\" button → Pick from templates\n  \"Invite to Notebook\" button → Converts solo → group cohort\n\n  ---\n  Implementation Plan:\n\n  1. Create \"Blank Notebook\" book template with:\n  {\n    title: \"Blank Notebook\",\n    config: {\n      type: 'notebook',\n      blank_pages: true,\n      auto_create_pages: true,\n      allow_community_prompts: false\n    },\n    prompts: [] // No prompts\n  }\n  2. Update /library to show:\n    - Quick action: \"New Notebook\" (uses blank template)\n    - Quick action: \"New Practice\" (shows templates)\n    - All user's cohorts (both solo & group)\n  3. Hide \"cohort\" language in UI:\n    - Solo cohorts → \"Notebooks\"\n    - Group cohorts with prompts → \"Practices\" or \"Circles\"\n  4. Deprecate old notebooks table eventually (or keep for backward compat)\n\n  What do you think? Unify or keep separate?\n\n> i like all these ideas, weekly reflection should be just questions from Bilal sounds lame, but i get it, it's a nice kit though \ngreat yeah it's just abook \n\n⏺ Haha yeah \"Questions from Bilal\" is your flagship, not the generic name. Let me create better names for the starter kit:\n\n⏺ Write(scripts/seed_starter_books.js)\n  ⎿  Wrote 219 lines to scripts/seed_starter_books.js          \n     // Seed starter books for the library\n     // Run with: node scripts/seed_starter_books.js\n     const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');\n     require('dotenv').config({ path: '.env.local' });\n     const supabase = createClient(\n       process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,\n       process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY\n     );\n     … +209 lines (ctrl+o to expand)\n\n> ok, why is a notebook called a cohort, that's weird is that how the architecture is? \n\n⏺ Yeah you're right, the naming is confusing! Let me clarify the architecture:\n\n  The Database Model:\n\n  BOOK (template)\n    ↓ \"creates instance of\"\n  COHORT (specific run of a book)\n    ↓ \"contains\"\n  POSTS (prompts at specific times)\n    ↓ \"get\"\n  RESPONSES (what people write)\n\n  Example:\n  - Book: \"Questions from Bilal\" (template)\n  - Cohort: \"Circle Zero\" (Bilal + 11 people, Oct 2025 - Oct 2026)\n  - Post: Week 1, Q1, opens Monday\n  - Response: Maya's answer to Q1\n\n  ---\n  The Problem:\n\n  When someone creates a blank notebook (no prompts), the architecture still needs:\n  - A book (template: \"Blank Notebook\")\n  - A cohort (instance: \"My Biology Notes\", 1 person = you)\n  - Posts (auto-created blank pages)\n  - Responses (what you write on each page)\n\n  So technically, your \"Biology Notes\" IS a cohort... but calling it that in the UI is weird.\n\n  ---\n  Solution: Hide the word \"cohort\" for solo books\n\n  In the UI:\n  - Books with max_cohort_size=1 → Call them \"Notebooks\" or \"Journals\"\n  - Books with prompts + solo → \"Practices\"\n  - Books with group → \"Cohorts\" or \"Circles\"\n\n  In the code/database:\n  - Everything is still technically a cohort\n  - But we never say \"cohort\" to users for solo things\n\n  Navigation:\n  /library\n  ├── 📓 My Notebooks (solo cohorts, blank pages)\n  ├── 📖 My Practices (solo cohorts, with prompts)\n  └── 👥 My Circles (group cohorts)\n\n  Data model stays the same, language changes:\n  // Database: still \"cohorts\" table\n  // UI: smart labeling based on config\n\n  function getCohortLabel(cohort) {\n    if (cohort.max_members === 1) {\n      return cohort.book.config?.blank_pages ? 'Notebook' : 'Practice';\n    }\n    return 'Circle';\n  }\n\n  So when you create \"Biology Notes\":\n  - You see: \"New Notebook\" button\n  - Backend does: Creates book + cohort (max_members=1)\n  - You never see: The word \"cohort\"\n\n  Make sense? The architecture uses cohorts for everything, but the UI hides that complexity.\n\n> practice... new facilitation? new? what? practice is also weird new ... experience new bookie? like movie? a book that moves? i dunno \n\n⏺ Haha you're right, \"practice\" is trying too hard. Let me think simpler:\n\n  What do we actually call these things?\n\n  The user's mental model should be:\n\n  1. \"I want to write notes\" → Blank pages, just me\n  2. \"I want a guided journal\" → Prompts help me reflect, just me\n  3. \"I want to do this with others\" → Same thing but with a group\n\n  ---\n  Simple naming:\n\n  In UI, just use:\n  - Notebook - blank or guided, doesn't matter, solo\n  - Circle - same thing but with people\n\n  So:\n  - Blank Notebook (solo)\n  - Morning Pages (solo)\n  - Sunday Reset (solo)\n  - Questions from Bilal (circle of 12)\n  - Gratitude Practice (circle of 3-8)\n\n  Navigation:\n  /library\n  ├── My Notebooks (all solo stuff, blank or guided)\n  └── My Circles (all group stuff)\n\n  Or even simpler:\n  /library\n  ├── Solo (just you)\n  └── Together (with others)\n\n  Button labels:\n  - \"New Notebook\" → pick blank or template\n  - \"Start a Circle\" → pick template, invite people\n\n  ---\n  Or we could just call everything \"notebooks\":\n\n  /library - My Notebooks\n  ├── Biology Notes (blank, solo)\n  ├── Morning Pages (guided, solo)\n  └── Questions from Bilal (guided, 12 people)\n\n  No categories at all. Just... notebooks. Some have prompts, some don't. Some are solo, some aren't.\n\n  Simplest possible:\n  - One button: \"New\"\n  - Pick: Blank or pick a template\n  - Pick: Solo or invite others\n  - Done\n\n  What feels least weird to you?\n\n⏺ You're right, it IS weird! Let me explain the architecture mismatch:\n\n  Current Architecture:\n\n  books table (templates)\n    ↓ creates instance\n  cohorts table (specific runs)\n    ↓ contains\n  posts table (prompts at times)\n    ↓ get\n  responses table (what people write)\n\n  So technically:\n  - \"Biology Notes\" = a cohort (with 1 member = you)\n  - \"Questions from Bilal Circle Zero\" = a cohort (with 12 members)\n\n  They're both cohorts in the database, just different sizes.\n\n  ---\n  But that's confusing UX!\n\n  Nobody thinks: \"I'm going to create a cohort to take biology notes\"\n\n  They think: \"I'm going to create a notebook\"\n\n  ---\n  Two Options:\n\n  Option A: Keep cohorts, change language\n\n  Database stays the same, but UI hides \"cohort\" for solo things:\n\n  // Database: everything is a cohort\n  // UI: smart labels\n\n  if (cohort.max_members === 1 && blank_pages) → \"Notebook\"\n  if (cohort.max_members === 1 && has_prompts) → \"Practice\"\n  if (cohort.max_members > 1) → \"Cohort\" or \"Circle\"\n\n  Pros: ✅ Simple architecture, one system\n  Cons: ❌ Awkward abstraction leak\n\n  ---\n  Option B: Separate notebooks table (current system)\n\n  Keep your existing notebooks table for personal notes:\n\n  notebooks table → /notebooks/[id] → personal notes\n  books/cohorts → /cohorts/[id] → group practices\n\n  Pros: ✅ Clear separation, no weird naming\n  Cons: ❌ Two systems to maintain\n\n  ---\n  My recommendation: Option B - Keep them separate\n\n  Why:\n  1. Personal notebooks are fundamentally different (no schedule, no group, just write)\n  2. Cohorts are about collective practice with structure\n  3. Trying to force them into one table creates confusion\n  4. You already have notebooks built!\n\n  So:\n  - /notebooks/[id] → Personal notes (existing system)\n  - /cohorts/[id] → Group practices (new system)\n  - /library → Browse both\n\n  They can share features (drawings, AI, search) but live in separate tables.\n\n  Does that make more sense? Keep notebooks as notebooks, cohorts as cohorts?\n\n> i'd like some gutenburg free copywrite book in the library too, something that can have the book on one side and then your journal on the other to \nreflect and maybe we can process it to make optional questions or facilitations to draw or do something from the book, we digest the book and make it a\n typeof our book \n\n⏺ OH that's brilliant! Like a book club + study guide + journal in one.\n\n  Gutenberg Books as Journals\n\n  Concept:\n  - Take public domain book (e.g., \"Meditations\" by Marcus Aurelius)\n  - Split it into digestible chunks\n  - Each \"prompt\" = a passage + reflection questions\n  - User reads left side, journals right side\n\n  ---\n  Example: \"Meditations by Marcus Aurelius\"\n\n  Book structure:\n  {\n    title: \"Meditations - A Guided Journal\",\n    description: \"Read Marcus Aurelius, reflect on Stoic wisdom\",\n    config: {\n      type: 'book_journal',\n      source_book: 'gutenberg:15780', // Project Gutenberg ID\n      reading_pace: 'weekly', // or daily, custom\n    },\n    prompts: [\n      {\n        order_index: 1,\n        question: \"Book 1, Paragraph 1-3\",\n        context: `\n          [Full text of passage]\n          \n          \"From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper...\"\n          \n          ---\n          \n          Reflect: Who taught you \"good morals\"?

Chunk the book (by chapter, section, or ~500 words)\n  2. Send to Claude:\n  Given this passage from [Book], generate:\n  - 1 reflection question\n  - 1 drawing prompt\n  - 1 discussion question (if in group)\n  3. Create book template with AI-generated prompts\n\n  Example processing:\n\n  // scripts/process_gutenberg_book.js\n\n  async function createBookJournal(gutenbergId) {\n    // 1. Fetch book from Gutenberg\n    const bookText = await fetchGutenberg(gutenbergId);\n\n    // 2. Split into chunks\n    const chunks = chunkBook(bookText, 500); // ~500 words each\n\n    // 3. Generate prompts with Claude\n    const prompts = [];\n    for (let i = 0; i < chunks.length; i++) {\n      const aiPrompt = await generatePrompt(chunks[i]);\n      prompts.push({\n        order_index: i + 1,\n        question: `Chapter ${i + 1}`,\n        context: `\n          ${chunks[i]}\n          \n          ---\n          \n          ${aiPrompt.reflection}\n          ${aiPrompt.drawing}\n        `\n      });\n    }\n\n    // 4.

Add to book config:\n\n  interface BookConfig {\n    type: 'journal' | 'book_journal' | 'practice';\n    source_text?: string; // Full text of reading\n    source_url?: string;  // Link to original\n    reading_side?: 'left' | 'top'; // Layout preference\n  }\n\n  2. New prompt field:\n\n  interface Prompt {\n    // ... existing fields\n    reading_content?: string; // The passage to read\n    reflection_prompts?: string[]; // Multiple questions\n    drawing_prompt?: string;\n  }\n\n  3. Response interface updates:\n\n  // /cohorts/[id]/current shows:\n  <div className=\"grid grid-cols-2\">\n    <div className=\"reading-pane\">\n      {post.prompt.reading_content}\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"response-pane\">\n      <Editor /> {/* Your response */}\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  ---\n  Should I:\n\n  1. Create the Gutenberg processor script? (scripts/process_gutenberg_book.js)\n  2. Seed one example book? (e.g., \"Meditations\")\n  3. Update response interface to show reading + writing side-by-side?\n\n  This is such a cool idea - turns classic books into interactive journaling experiences!\n\n> yeah, keep notebooks seoarate - but hteyr'e also just books not notebooks same same - we can keep calling everything notebook i guess and that's jus \nt\"book\" although it's weird when there are book experiences that are more refined it's not always just a note book it's a notable book or something \nsomething that implies interaction \n\n⏺ You're onto something! The language matters. Let me think about this:\n\n  The Core Tension:\n\n  \"Notebook\" implies:\n  - Blank, unstructured\n  - Personal, private\n  - Just notes\n\n  But some experiences are:\n  - Structured (prompts, schedule)\n  - Interactive (reading + responding)\n  - Refined (curated, designed)\n\n  So \"notebook\" doesn't fit when it's:\n  - \"Meditations - A Guided Journal\" (book + prompts)\n  - \"Questions from Bilal\" (designed experience)\n  - \"30-Day Writing Sprint\" (structured program)\n\n  ---\n  Better Universal Term?\n\n  What if we just call everything a \"book\" and let the type/context clarify:\n\n  User-facing language:\n\n  In the interface:\n  - \"Your books\" (everything you're working in)\n  - Some books are blank (notebooks)\n  - Some books have guides (prompts)\n  - Some books have reading (Gutenberg)\n  - Some books have people (circles)\n\n  Navigation:\n  /library - Your Books\n  ├── 🗒️ Blank Books (Biology Notes, Work Journal)\n  ├── 📖 Guided Books (Morning Pages, Sunday Reset)\n  ├── 📚 Book Studies (Meditations, The Prophet)\n  └── 👥 Shared Books (Questions from Bilal w/ 12 people)\n\n  Or even simpler, no categories:\n  /library - Your Books\n\n  Biology Notes (blank, solo)\n  Morning Pages (guided, solo)\n  Meditations Study (reading + guided, solo)\n  Questions from Bilal (guided, 12 people)\n\n  ---\n  Architecture Clarity:\n\n  Keep it simple in code:\n\n  1. notebooks table = personal, freeform (existing system)\n    - Route: /notebooks/[id]\n    - What users call it: \"My blank book\" or just \"notebook\"\n  2. books table = templates (new system)\n    - What it is: reusable template\n    - Examples: \"Morning Pages\", \"Meditations Study\", \"Questions from Bilal\"\n  3. cohorts table = instances of books (new system)\n    - Route: /cohorts/[id] (or we could rename route to /books/[id]?)\n    - What users call it: Just \"the book\" they're working in\n    - Behind the scenes: it's a cohort (instance)\n\n  So the user journey:\n\n  1. Browse library → See book templates\n  2. Pick one → \"Start this book\" (creates cohort)\n  3. Work in it → \"My books\" (your active cohorts)\n  4. Or start blank → \"New blank book\" (creates notebook)\n\n  ---\n  URL Structure Option:\n\n  Instead of /cohorts/[id], what if we use:\n\n  /library                    → Browse templates\n  /library/meditations        → Book detail page\n  /library/meditations/start  → Create your instance\n\n  /books/[id]                 → Your active book (actually a cohort)\n  /books/[id]/current         → Current prompt/page\n\n  This way:\n  - User never sees \"cohort\"\n  - Everything is just \"books\"\n  - Behind scenes: cohort = your instance of a book template\n\n  ---\n  Final Naming Proposal:\n\n  Stop fighting the terminology. Embrace \"book\" for everything:\n\n  User-facing:\n  - \"Your books\" (what you're working in)\n  - \"Library\" (templates to start from)\n  - \"Blank book\" (notebook)\n  - \"Guided book\" (has prompts)\n  - \"Book study\" (has reading)\n  - \"Shared book\" (with others)\n\n  Code/Database:\n  - notebooks table (legacy personal notes)\n  - books table (templates)\n  - cohorts table (instances) - but call them \"books\" in UI/routes\n\n  It's all just... books. Some blank, some guided, some shared. Simple.\n\n  What do you think? Just call everything books and let the context explain the rest?\n\n> love the starter books \n\n⏺ Bash(node scripts/seed_starter_books.js)\n  ⎿  Error: /Users/bilalghalib/Projects/scripts/cursive-app/scripts/seed_starter_books.js:28\n         description: 'Stream of consciousness writing, every morning.

Let me think about this:\n\n- **Book** = template/cartridge (the design)\n- **Cohort** = the actual gameplay/run (putting cartridge in system)\n\nThey mentioned:\n- \"same book multiple runs\"\n- \"like putting a game cartridge in the system\"\n- wants the analogy to be familiar and clear\n\nActually, there are several good analogies:\n1. **Game cartridge → Session**: Book is cartridge, cohort is your save file/playthrough\n2. **Recipe → Meal**: Book is recipe, cohort is the actual meal you make\n3. **Class curriculum → Semester**: Book is curriculum, cohort is Fall 2025 section\n4. **Notion template → Workspace**: Book is template, cohort is your copy\n\nThe user seems to like the game cartridge one. In gaming:\n- Cartridge/Game = the design\n- **Playthrough/Save file/Session/Run** = your specific instance\n\nActually \"**Session**\" or \"**Run**\" might work well. Or \"**Playthrough**\".\n\nFor books/journals:\n- Book = template\n- **Run/Session/Journey/Circle/Expedition** (user mentioned expedition)\n\nLet me think about what's most natural:\n- \"Start a new run\" - gaming language, clear\n- \"Start a session\" - therapy/workshop language\n- \"Join a circle\" - intimate, social\n- \"Begin a journey\" - too abstract?\n\nThe user also mentioned the AI makes any book feel like a cohort (like having a companion).

They specifically mentioned Steve Jobs, Buster Benson, Brett Victor, and want 5 other unique researchers/perspectives.\n\nLet me think of 5 fundamentally different approaches to this naming/conceptual problem:\n\n1. **Action-oriented approach** - Focus on what the user does\n2. **Metaphor-based approach** - Use familiar analogies \n3. **Invisible/transparent approach** - Make the concept disappear\n4. **Community-focused approach** - Emphasize the social aspect\n5. **Time-based approach** - Emphasize the temporal dimension\n\nNow for the thinkers and how they might approach this:\n\n**Steve Jobs** - Would want it to be instantly intuitive, probably a single word that feels inevitable once you hear it. He'd want something that doesn't require explanation.\n\n**Buster Benson** - As someone who thinks about behavior change and systems thinking, he'd probably focus on the habit/behavior aspect rather than the technology.\n\n**Brett Victor** - As someone focused on direct manipulation and making the invisible visible, he'd probably want to eliminate abstract concepts entirely.\n\nLet me add 5 other researchers with distinct perspectives:\n- **Donald Norman** (design/affordances) \n- **Sherry Turkle** (technology and relationships)\n- **Cal Newport** (deep work/attention)\n- **Jenny Odell** (attention and resistance to optimization)\n- **Robin Dunbar** (social group dynamics)Five orthogonally different approaches:\n\n## 1. Action-Oriented\nSkip nouns entirely. Just verbs:\n- \"Start Morning Pages\"\n- \"Continue Meditations\" \n- \"Join Questions from Bilal\"\nNo conceptual overhead - just what you do.\n\n## 2. Invisible Infrastructure  \nNever name it.

He'd want something that doesn't require explanation.\n\n**Buster Benson** - As someone who thinks about behavior change and systems thinking, he'd probably focus on the habit/behavior aspect rather than the technology.\n\n**Brett Victor** - As someone focused on direct manipulation and making the invisible visible, he'd probably want to eliminate abstract concepts entirely.\n\nLet me add 5 other researchers with distinct perspectives:\n- **Donald Norman** (design/affordances) \n- **Sherry Turkle** (technology and relationships)\n- **Cal Newport** (deep work/attention)\n- **Jenny Odell** (attention and resistance to optimization)\n- **Robin Dunbar** (social group dynamics)",

Circle.so is a major community platform - that's a collision waiting to happen. This is why you check domains before falling in love with names.\n\nCircle.so does exactly what I described - community building, courses, events. Too close to your space. \"Circle\" is off the table.\n\nBack to other options that avoid existing platforms:\n\n## \"Thread\" \n```\n\"I'm threading morning pages\"\n\"Our Bilal thread is on week 5\" \n\"Start a new thread\"\n```\nRisk: Twitter uses threads, but different context.\n\n## \"Weave\"\n```\n\"Weaving my morning practice\"\n\"Join our gratitude weave\"\n\"I'm in three weaves right now\"\n```\nClean metaphor, implies connection over time.\n\n## \"Flow\" \n```\n\"My morning flow\"\n\"We're flowing through Meditations\"\n\"Start a flow with friends\"\n```\nBut Flow.com might exist too.\n\n## \"Path\"\n```\n\"Walking the morning pages path\"\n\"Our Bilal path\"\n\"I'm on three paths\"\n```\nSpiritual/journey connotations.\n\n## Or go completely abstract:\n\n**\"Session\"** - but that feels temporary\n**\"Track\"** - might work. \"I'm tracking morning pages\"\n**\"Line\"** - \"My morning line,\" \"Join our line\"\n\nThe collision with Circle.so actually reveals something important: your space (structured group reflection) overlaps with existing community/course platforms. You need naming that differentiates from:\n- Circle.so (communities)\n- Cohort platforms\n- Course platforms  \n- Book clubs\n\nMaybe the differentiation IS the name. What makes yours unique isn't the group aspect - it's the **structured reflection + time + witness** aspect.\n\nWhat about focusing on the reflection rather than the group?\n\n**\"Practice\"** might still be the winner. Hard to trademark, broad enough to avoid collisions, captures the essence.",

This is why you check domains before falling in love with names.\n\nCircle.so does exactly what I described - community building, courses, events. Too close to your space. \"Circle\" is off the table.\n\nBack to other options that avoid existing platforms:\n\n## \"Thread\" \n```\n\"I'm threading morning pages\"\n\"Our Bilal thread is on week 5\" \n\"Start a new thread\"\n```\nRisk: Twitter uses threads, but different context.\n\n## \"Weave\"\n```\n\"Weaving my morning practice\"\n\"Join our gratitude weave\"\n\"I'm in three weaves right now\"\n```\nClean metaphor, implies connection over time.\n\n## \"Flow\" \n```\n\"My morning flow\"\n\"We're flowing through Meditations\"\n\"Start a flow with friends\"\n```\nBut Flow.com might exist too.\n\n## \"Path\"\n```\n\"Walking the morning pages path\"\n\"Our Bilal path\"\n\"I'm on three paths\"\n```\nSpiritual/journey connotations.\n\n## Or go completely abstract:\n\n**\"Session\"** - but that feels temporary\n**\"Track\"** - might work. \"I'm tracking morning pages\"\n**\"Line\"** - \"My morning line,\" \"Join our line\"\n\nThe collision with Circle.so actually reveals something important: your space (structured group reflection) overlaps with existing community/course platforms. You need naming that differentiates from:\n- Circle.so (communities)\n- Cohort platforms\n- Course platforms  \n- Book clubs\n\nMaybe the differentiation IS the name. What makes yours unique isn't the group aspect - it's the **structured reflection + time + witness** aspect.\n\nWhat about focusing on the reflection rather than the group?\n\n**\"Practice\"** might still be the winner.
