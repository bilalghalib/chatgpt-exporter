      "content": "Bike grease is stubborn stuff — it doesn’t rinse away with just water, and you don’t want to damage your sink finish or clog your drain. Here are a few good approaches depending on what you have on hand:  \n\n**Immediate wipe-down (best first step):**  \n- Use paper towels, rags, or even newspaper to wipe up as much grease as possible before adding water. This prevents smearing and clogs.  \n\n**For stainless steel or ceramic sinks:**  \n1. **Dish soap (degreaser type):** Put a few drops of concentrated dish soap (like Dawn, Fairy, or any strong grease-cutting one) on the spot, scrub with a sponge or brush, then rinse with hot water.  \n2. **Baking soda paste:** Sprinkle baking soda on the greasy area, scrub with a damp sponge — the mild abrasion lifts the grease.  \n3. **White vinegar + dish soap:** Spray or pour vinegar, then add a little dish soap, scrub, rinse hot.  \n\n**If it’s really stubborn:**  \n- Citrus-based cleaners (like Goo Gone, or even just rubbing with an orange/lemon peel plus baking soda).  \n- A bit of rubbing alcohol or mineral spirits on a rag (test first if your sink is delicate, like enamel).  \n\n**Drain protection tip:**  \nGrease hardens in pipes — after cleaning, run **very hot water** (or pour boiling water + dish soap) down the drain to flush it through.  \n\n👉 Do you know what kind of sink surface you have (stainless, porcelain, enamel, stone)? That’ll help me suggest the safest method.",
