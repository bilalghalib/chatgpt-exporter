Food prices increased due to a drought linked to climate change. \n\nPeer discussions:\nWhat are the main challenges Iraq faces due to climate change?\nSource: https://kapita.iq/storage/app/media/New%20Research%20Publications/Climate%20Change%20Overview.pdf \n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nThe fact that Climate Changes Impact are causing droughts and increased desertification is becoming quite evident in recent years in Iraq and Syria forming the two limbs of what is known as the “Fertile Crescent”.\nA direct consequence of the increased aridity, which is strongly felt, is the occurrence of sandstorms. According to the United Nations report, it indicates that the Iraqi Ministry of Environment has recorded 122 dust storms and 283 dusty days in 2012 and it estimates that this will increase to 300 dusty days per year in the next ten years. \nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nBy the end of this century, the “Fertile Crescent” would lose its current shape and could disappear altogether. The area shown in picture witnessed one of the most devastating droughts in decades in (2007-2008) which scientists have linked to Climate Changes. This severe drought hit most of Syria and northern Iraq during what is normally the wettest time of the year. \nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nDust storms have increased by 10x over the since the 1990s.\nDust storms have resulted in the closure of airports and hospitalizations  resulting from dust-induced respiratory illnesses.\nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nWater Scarcities\nWater withdrawals in riparian countries, particularly Turkey, Iran, and to a lesser extent Syria, are increasing due to rising demand. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources, future projections under climate change indicate worsening conditions for the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Studies suggest the Euphrates-Tigris discharge could decline by 9.5% between 2040 and 2069, with some estimates predicting up to a 73% reduction in the Euphrates River's annual flow.\nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nSea Level Rise (SLR)\nThe increase in the sea level due to climate change is more likely to impact many coastal areas and inundate low-lying regions. And the most concerning area is Basrah Governorate with their seven districts.\nReduced flow from the rivers along with a rising sea level creates high saline levels in the rivers, harming agriculture, livestock and the people living off of them.\nSea water comes as far as 189 kilometers upstream from the Persian Gulf and destroying 24,000 hectares of agricultural land and 30,000 trees. \nWithout inundations of fresh water, pollutants from agriculture, the oil and gas industry, and sewage have also become more concentrated.\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349103014_The_Impacts_of_Sea_Level_Rise_on_Basrah_City_Iraq \n\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349103014_The_Impacts_of_Sea_Level_Rise_on_Basrah_City_Iraq \nhttps://e360.yale.edu/features/iraq-marshes-drought-climate-change \n\nPortion of the original population displaced due to environmental factors.

This system is designed to evaluate the sustainability levels of existing and new buildings. The GZRS is intended as a local rating system that will be formulated and applied within the context of Mosul and Iraq.\n\nProject Description\nThe Green Ziggurat Rating System (GZRS) is named after the ziggurats, which were iconic structures in ancient Mesopotamian architecture, symbolizing the unique historical and cultural identity of Iraq. The ziggurat, an Akkadian word meaning \"the high place,\" has become emblematic of Iraqi architectural heritage.\n\nThe system will provide a standardized national benchmark to assess the sustainability of buildings, helping to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of construction and promoting a sustainable architectural approach. The objectives of the system include:\n\nProviding a national standard: This will help in assessing the sustainability level of buildings and provide unified national results to achieve sustainability.\nReducing environmental impacts: The system aims to reduce the negative environmental effects of buildings.\nRaising awareness: The system will enhance awareness among the community regarding the environmental aspects of sustainability and the importance of sustainable buildings.\nPreserving identity: The system seeks to preserve and highlight the architectural and cultural identity of Iraq.\nDetails and Rating Criteria\nThe GZRS assesses projects based on their adherence to sustainable development principles. It provides a comprehensive evaluation by examining various dimensions such as energy efficiency, resource management, and environmental impact. The system is designed to encourage improvements in sustainable practices across university projects.\n\nRating Criteria\nThe GZRS includes a detailed scoring system that evaluates projects according to multiple criteria, as illustrated in the following table:\n\nCriterion\tPercentage\nEnergy Efficiency\t10%\nResource Management\t28%\nEnvironmental Impact\t32%\nWater Efficiency\t12%\nWaste Management\t18%\nSustainable Building Materials\t10%\nSustainable Transportation\t5%\nInnovation in Design\t105%\nVisual Indicators\nThe system uses visual indicators to demonstrate the overall rating of projects:\n\n60-70%: 5-level Ziggurat Rating System\n48-60%: 4-level Ziggurat Rating System\n40-48%: 3-level Ziggurat Rating System\n35-40%: 2-level Ziggurat Rating System\n30-35%: 1-level Ziggurat Rating System\nCertificates\nCertificates will be awarded to buildings based on their sustainability rating, according to the following scale:\n\n85-100 Points: N/A (Top Level Certificate)\n70-84 Points: 4-Level Ziggurat Certificate\n60-69 Points: 3-Level Ziggurat Certificate\n50-59 Points: 2-Level Ziggurat Certificate\n40-49 Points: 1-Level Ziggurat Certificate\nParticipants\nProf. Dr. Qusay Kamal al-Din al-Ahmadi\nProf. Dr. Abd al-Rahim Ibrahim Jassem\nDr. Riham Ali Talib al-Shammari\nDr. Basim Ihsan Abd al-Qadir al-Hafiz\nEng.
