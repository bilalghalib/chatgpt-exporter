The grants Bloom was operating ended in December and the overhead funds which were to be used for emergencies and times in between grants was used in risky investments in R&D for software. While the software development has gone well it is not bringing in any revenue yet, the leadership team, mostly David Munir Nabti, believes that we are close. He is pushing the team to work harder yet the end goal for achieving financial stability using the Bloom platform as a software as a service (SaaS) tool is moving further and further into the distance. The software platform is useful for the internal Bloom team running programs and is at a stable place. Bloom does not need to further develop the software to be able to run programs using it, and to get grants presenting the tool as a way to run scalable programs internationally online. Bloom can focus more on the quality of the programs, the reporting, the funder communication, the data analysis, and be less distracted by putting effort into the programs more than the platform. Team members are getting disheartened and some are beginning to think about quitting due to the broken promises and the lack of strategic direction. Some potential future options are to find a business to business (B2B) approach where we sell training and coaching to other businesses to improve their internal team performance in a quantified way using the Bloom framework and tools.
