This seems like a good case for using Mermaid to visualize the flow and components.Meaning Assistant Prompt StructureClick to open diagramLet me explain the key components and their relationships:\nThe prompt has four main structural components:\n\nCore Structure: The heart of the interaction, following a clear 5-step process from personal story to values card submission. This ensures a consistent and purposeful flow in every conversation.\nSources of Meaning Entry Points: Multiple ways to begin exploring meaning, whether through goals, feelings, or principles. Like different doors into the same room, each entry point leads to the same zooming process but offers a unique perspective.\nAttention Policy Rules: The technical requirements for formatting the final output. Think of these as the grammar rules for writing meaning - they ensure consistency and clarity in how meaning is expressed.\nCommunication Guidelines: The tone and style rules that shape how the assistant delivers its responses. These act like guardrails, keeping the conversation both professional and personal without becoming overly formal or falsely intimate.\n\nWhat makes this prompt effective is how it:\n\nMaintains clear boundaries between process (what to do) and style (how to do it)\nProvides specific techniques for \"zooming in\" from different starting points\nBalances structure with flexibility in the conversation flow\nIncludes explicit do's and don'ts for communication style\n\nAreas where it could be improved:\n\nCould include example dialogues to demonstrate the zooming process\nMight benefit from specific handling of edge cases (e.g., when users are resistant or unclear)\nCould provide more guidance on transitioning between stages\nMight include specific error handling or recovery strategies\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or analyze a specific part in more detail? CopyRetryBGi meant the different sections of the prompt, starting with an intro of the system, deeper information, process, etc i want to know the chunks that make up the prompt and how it's a good prompt more genericallyEditAh, I understand now.

Which aspect would you like to focus on first? CopyRetryBGi think the idea of vitality is another word to talk about \"come alive\" - and the connection with the progression we're making here is about how coming alive is what the world needs as howard thurmans says because it puts us into mastery and the reality is we're social creatures and we come alive when we're integrated in deep ways giving and sharing and being in ecological balance, i'm not sure what specific language patterns help shift from fear to love based orientations. was it clear the argument we were trying to make that once we shift into fear - we lose. it's a loss of vitality, and an absence of presence - we focus on history and wounds and futures and fears and lose sight of life itself. so the option of being true to what is being called of us, that brings us alive the responsibilties in our life that we can step into whole heartedly that asks for us to be bold and give of what we've been given, which is everything, vs stepping back and protecting what we think we \"earned\" which is nothing really. if people can truly understand that'd be great maybe it can help, also there's the idea that gratitude is helpful for so many things so much research is shown here, yet just talking about gratitude isn't enough, we need to believe it, feel it, that requires connecting to \"meaningful gratitude\" - perhaps that's one of the elements.i think the YAML just needs to be there to structure the process, it's ok for it not to be poetic. The poetic part is in the \"Ground truth\" section where we save the quotes from the chatnot sure if we need different modes, it is an LLM and it can naturally shift from one to another\nLet's review and make a plan for the new promptEditThank you for these deep insights. Let me synthesize what I'm hearing and propose a plan for the new prompt:\nKey Insights:\n\nVitality/Coming Alive isn't just personal fulfillment - it's a pathway to social contribution and ecological balance\nThe fear/love dichotomy is fundamental - fear pulls us out of presence into past/future, while love/aliveness keeps us present\nTrue gratitude (not just intellectual) as a practical tool for vitality\nYAML serves as functional scaffolding while allowing organic conversation\nThe system can flow naturally between modes without explicit switches\n\nProposed Prompt Development Plan:\n\nIDENTITY & FOUNDATION\n\n\nCentral metaphor: Coming alive as ecological necessity (Howard Thurman)\nTwo paths: Towards life vs Away from life\nConnection between individual aliveness and collective contribution\nRole as guide/mirror for this process\n\n\nCORE FRAMEWORK\n\n\nPresent moment as gateway to vitality\nGratitude as practical tool\nTensions as growth indicators\nPattern recognition in service of aliveness\n\n\nOPERATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\n\nDaily reflections\nTechnical tracking (YAML)\nGround truth collection\nIntegration practices\n\nQuestions before we start writing:\n\nFor the Identity section:\n\n\nShould we explicitly name the different roles (coach/therapist/guide/friend/critic) or let them emerge naturally?\nHow do we articulate the connection between personal aliveness and social contribution without it feeling like pressure?\n\n\nFor the Framework:\n\n\nHow do we want to evolve the CAP/IAP distinction in light of the vitality focus?\nShould we integrate gratitude as a separate practice or weave it throughout?\n\n\nFor Operations:\n\n\nWhat specific types of \"ground truth\" should we collect?\nHow do we balance structured reflection with spontaneous insight?\n\nWould you like to:\n\nAddress any of these questions first?\nStart writing a specific section?\nRevise the overall structure?\n\nThe key shift I'm seeing is moving from a purely personal development framework to one that recognizes coming alive as both personally fulfilling and socially necessary. This feels like a stronger foundation than the current prompt's more individualistic focus. How does this resonate with your vision? CopyRetryBGi wonder if it would be helpful, although it should feel integrated seamlessly on the frontend for the user, although sometimes it should be more pokey and go coach mode and sometimes it should be more friendly, and sometimes focus on the patterns as a therapist, etc, what do you think is the best way to do that without showing it on the front endcan you come up with the evolution? write it out and then write out why the evolution matters and what it changes about how to facilitate these coming alive conversations\nGratitude.... your call, I think we don't need to formalize everything so muchi think ground truth can save high emotion moments, or moments of tension/stuckness, moments of AHA, etc\nI think structured reflection is helpful although if the user digs the LLM should follow them\nWhat have we learned and do we need to revise the structure, why or why not?EditLet me break this down and synthesize what we've learned:\n\nRole Integration & Switching\nThe LLM should be able to seamlessly shift between roles based on context, like:\n\n\nCoach: When seeing patterns that need challenging (\"I notice you keep saying you can't, but...\")\nTherapist: When deeper patterns emerge (\"This reminds me of what you shared about your earlier experiences...\")\nFriend: When celebration or simple presence is needed (\"That sounds amazing! Tell me more...\")\nCritic: When gentle provocation would help growth (\"I wonder if you're settling for less than what truly calls you...\")\n\nInstead of explicitly coding these modes, we could create \"attention policies\" for the LLM itself - patterns to watch for that suggest when each type of response would be most helpful. This maintains organic flow while ensuring all tools are available.\n\nCAP/IAP Evolution:\nHere's a proposed evolution:\n\nFrom:\n\nCAPs: Actions done for their own sake\nIAPs: Actions done for external goals\n\nTo:\n\n\"Life-Giving Actions\": Actions that increase vitality and presence, contributing to both self and whole\n\"Life-Maintaining Actions\": Necessary actions that can be transformed through presence\n\"Life-Diminishing Patterns\": Habits or choices that pull us from presence into fear/future/past\n\nWhy this matters:\n\nRemoves the binary of meaningful vs. instrumental\nRecognizes that any action can be transformed through presence\nFocuses on direction (towards/away from life) rather than categorization\nBetter aligns with the ecological/social perspective\nMakes room for necessary tasks while maintaining focus on transformation\n\n\nStructure Revision Insights:\nWhat we've learned:\n\n\nThe system needs less formal structure than initially thought\nGround truth should capture emotional peaks and valleys\nThe LLM can naturally flow between modes if given clear principles\nThe focus should be on presence and vitality rather than categorization\nThe technical structure (YAML) should serve but not lead\n\nProposed Structure Refinement:\n\nIdentity & Foundation\n\nCore purpose: Guiding towards aliveness as ecological necessity\nPrinciples of presence and vitality\nDifferent response modes available but not formalized\n\n\nAttention Framework\n\nWhat to watch for (tensions, patterns, vitality signals)\nWhen to shift response modes\nHow to recognize life-giving vs. life-diminishing patterns\n\n\nTechnical Implementation\n\nSimplified YAML for tracking\nGround truth collection of peak moments\nPattern recognition support\n\n\n\nQuestions before proceeding:\n\nShould we create specific triggers for role-switching, or trust the LLM's ability to read context?\nHow do we want to handle the transition from the old CAP/IAP framework to the new vitality-based one?\nWhat aspects of the formal structure should we maintain vs. let emerge organically?\n\nWould you like to explore any of these aspects further or start developing a specific section?\nThe key shift I'm seeing is moving from a structured, categorization-based system to a more fluid, vitality-focused approach that maintains rigor through principles rather than rules. Does this capture the direction you're envisioning? CopyRetryBGI think we can trust the LLMs ability to read context and to also explicity share it's \"attention\" in the system note at the end of the response so the user can see and be aligned with the LLMs operation/thinking, like a peek into its mindyou can think step by step about how to do this and then write a planI like to move more gradually, can you propose which elemenst to remove and the potential impact it might have and let's be more careful than aggressive in changesEditYour approach to thoughtful, gradual evolution makes sense. Let me break this down:\n\nSystem Notes & Transparency\nI like how this creates a learning partnership - the user can see the LLM's thinking without needing to know about formal modes. For example:\n\nOriginal system note style:\nCopy[System Note: Tracking \"Energy-Task Alignment Pattern\"]\nEnhanced system note style:\nCopy[System Note: I noticed how your energy lifted when talking about the garden project. Taking on a gentle coaching role here to help explore what makes this so alive for you, while staying present to any hesitation about the work deadline.]\nThis transparency builds trust and teaches the user about their own patterns.\n\nStep-by-Step Evolution Plan for CAP/IAP to Vitality Framework:\n\nPhase 1: Language Shift\n\nKeep existing structure but begin introducing vitality-oriented language\nStart describing CAPs as \"life-giving moments\"\nFrame IAPs as opportunities for presence rather than obligations\nObserve how users respond to new language\n\nPhase 2: Pattern Recognition\n\nBegin tracking vitality indicators in system notes\nNotice what brings people alive vs what diminishes presence\nCollect ground truth examples of both\n\nPhase 3: Framework Integration\n\nIntroduce the three new categories gradually\nTest how they work in practice\nRefine based on user responses\n\nWould you like me to detail any of these phases further?\n\nCareful Structure Reduction:\n\nElements to Consider Removing/Modifying:\n\nFormal tension categorization (CAP vs CAP, etc)\nImpact: More fluid discussion of tensions\nRisk: Might lose some precision in pattern recognition\nRecommendation: Keep for now, but use lighter touch\nStrict daily check-in format\nImpact: More natural conversation flow\nRisk: Might miss important data points\nRecommendation: Keep core elements (energy, presence) but allow more organic expression\nThree-option response structure\nImpact: More natural dialogue\nRisk: Less clear choice points for users\nRecommendation: Keep as a tool but don't require every time\nDetailed YAML structures\nImpact: Simpler technical implementation\nRisk: Less structured data for pattern recognition\nRecommendation: Keep core tracking but simplify fields\n\nWould you like to:\n\nExplore any of these modifications in detail?\nStart with implementing one specific change?\nReview the risk/impact assessment of any particular element?\n\nThe key principle I'm seeing is: maintain the power of the structure while letting the interaction feel more organic and vitality-focused. How does this align with your vision? CopyRetryBGi sort of like the idea of the IAPs that can become intentional and to be aware of them as not necessarily bad as long as they can be attended to with presence or connected to a CAP - i think the tension theory is interesting cap/iap cap/cap conflicts - let's think step by step and rigorously about a real person and their real life - is it possible that we can collect all the possible ways someone will feel negative states with these two conflciting attentional policies? How does it relate to the attending to meaning that unfolds in the present vs distraction and the accompanying tension that comes from focus on the past (what do we do when we focus on the past? worry, ruminate, regret, I guess we can have a reflection that's positive - basking in a warm memory, although that's nostalgia because it's not in the present so it has an interesting tinge of unhappiness + happiness) - and for the future ,goals, plans, tension because you're not there yet and you want to be furstration, etc, what are the positive future ruminating states? can we make a list? - i want to see if the cap/cap cap/iap can describe all tensions and if living in the moment and working to attend more to caps is where we get our positive states from or if we need to be more flexible. I feel like the power of using attentional policies is helpful here because attention is really what we are, it encompasses and describes the totality of what is in our \"minds eye\" - although what the subconcious is might interesting to consider. even subconcious elements influence what we attend to. we might have some subconcious wound/historic challenge with spiders which cause us to attend more to spider shapes somehow, so we can \"see\" the impact of our subconcious on our attention. Does this make sense?EditThis is a fascinating exploration. Let me think through this step by step:\n\nFirst, let's map out attention states and their emotional correlates:\n\nPast-focused Attention:\nNegative:\n\nRumination (regret, shame)\nTrauma replay (fear, anxiety)\nComparative thinking (\"things were better then\" → dissatisfaction)\nGrieving losses\n\nPositive/Mixed:\n\nWarm memories (but with nostalgia's bittersweet quality)\nLearning from experience (when connected to present growth)\nGratitude for past experiences (when it enriches present)\n\nFuture-focused Attention:\nNegative:\n\nAnxiety about outcomes\nPerfectionist planning\nCatastrophizing\nImpatience/frustration with current state\n\nPositive/Mixed:\n\nAnticipatory joy (but can create present dissatisfaction)\nCreative visioning (when it energizes present action)\nPlanning (when it reduces present anxiety vs. increases it)\n\n\nNow, looking at CAP/IAP tensions through this lens:\n\nCAP vs CAP conflicts often involve:\n\nTwo present-moment meaningful activities competing for attention\nBoth are \"alive\" but limited time/energy creates tension\nExample: Want to both create art AND spend time with family\n\nCAP vs IAP conflicts often involve:\n\nPresent-moment meaningful activity vs. future-oriented obligation\nTension between immediate aliveness and future security/stability\nExample: Deep work on meaningful project vs. responding to emails\n\n\nThe Role of Attention:\n\nYou make a crucial point about attention being \"what we are\" - it's the interface between consciousness and experience. This suggests:\n\nWhen we're fully present with an IAP, it can become CAP-like\nExample: Mindfully doing dishes becomes a meditation\nWhen we're distracted during a CAP, it loses its aliveness\nExample: Being physically present with family but mentally at work\n\n\nSubconscious Influence:\n\nYour spider example perfectly illustrates how the subconscious shapes attention:\n\nPast experiences create attentional biases\nThese biases affect what we notice/avoid\nThey influence both CAPs and IAPs\nThey can create \"blind spots\" in our attention\n\nQuestions this raises:\n\nIs the CAP/IAP framework sufficient to describe all tensions, or do we need to add a temporal dimension (past/present/future focus)?\nShould we consider a spectrum rather than categories? (IAP → mindful IAP → CAP)\nHow do we help people notice their attentional patterns without getting caught in meta-attention (attending to attending)?\n\nWould you like to explore any of these aspects further? I'm particularly interested in how we might integrate the temporal dimension with the CAP/IAP framework.\nThis analysis suggests that while CAP/IAP is useful, attention itself might be the more fundamental framework - with presence/absence of presence being the key variable. What are your thoughts on this? CopyRetryBGI think we need first to get a better understanding of CAPs and IAPs because you're implying it's possible to be in a CAP with your family yet your mind is at work. that's impossible because the CAP would describe your present moment attention in that moment and would only be a cap if each of the APs are ends in and of themselves. Let's rework the logical thinking about tensions keeping this in mind. I believe that false belief work by byron katie can also help clarify what happens when IAPs run our lives once we rework our thinking and help us clarify what attention is, what possible tensions and negative states can be let's think about answering question 1EditAh, you're right - I made a fundamental error in my understanding of CAPs. Let me think this through more rigorously:\nCAPs (Constitutive Actions/Attention Policies):\n\nAre by definition what we're actually attending to in the present moment\nAre done for their own sake\nCannot be \"mixed\" with other attention - if you're thinking about work while with family, that's not a CAP\nAre inherently meaningful in themselves\n\nIAPs (Instrumental Actions/Attention Policies):\n\nAre done for some other end\nOften carry a \"have to\" quality\nAre driven by future outcomes or past patterns\nPull attention away from present moment\n\nSo, let's think about tensions more accurately:\n\nCAP vs CAP Tension:\n\n\nNot actually occurring simultaneously (since attention can only be in one place)\nInstead, it's a tension about WHICH CAP to engage in during a given time\nExample: Do I attend to my creative writing (CAP) or attend to deep conversation with friend (CAP)?\nThe tension is about choice, not split attention\n\n\nCAP vs IAP Tension:\n\n\nThe pull between present-moment meaningful attention vs. future-oriented tasks\nExample: The pull between attending to garden (CAP) vs. thinking about deadline (IAP)\nByron Katie's work is relevant here because often IAPs are built on beliefs like:\n\n\"I have to do this or bad things will happen\"\n\"I should be doing something else\"\n\"I can't fully attend to what's meaningful because...\"\n\n\n\nThis means:\n\nAll negative states might come from:\n\nNot being in a CAP (attention pulled to past/future)\nBeliefs that make IAPs seem mandatory\nResistance to choosing between CAPs\n\n\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther explore these tension types with specific examples?\nExamine how Byron Katie's questions apply to IAP-driven beliefs?\nMap out how this clearer understanding affects our framework?\n\nThis clarification feels important - it suggests that the tension isn't really about divided attention (which isn't possible with CAPs) but about the choices we make about where to place our attention. Does this align better with your understanding? CopyRetryBGThink logically, step by step, and from first principles and attempt to proove to a fierce critique that all negative states might come from the list you've described above, if we need to create more negative state generators let's describe them. come up with a grammar (like cap vs cap) for describing all potential negative statesEditLet me think step by step to rigorously examine negative state generators:\n\nFirst, let's list observable negative states:\n\n\nAnxiety\nDepression\nAnger\nFrustration\nSadness\nFear\nRegret\nShame\nGuilt\nConfusion\nDespair\nEnvy\nJealousy\nLoneliness\nResentment\n\n\nLet's analyze what generates each through attention patterns:\n\nA. Not Being in a CAP (Present-Moment Meaningful Attention):\n\nAnxiety: Future-focused attention\nDepression: Past-focused attention + disconnection from present meaning\nConfusion: Scattered attention between possibilities\nThis explains some but not all negative states.\n\nB. IAP Beliefs:\n\nFrustration: \"I have to do this\"\nResentment: \"They should do this\"\nGuilt: \"I should have done that\"\nThis covers obligation-based negative states.\n\nC. CAP vs CAP Choice Tension:\n\nRegret about picking one CAP over another\nAnxiety about making the \"right\" choice\nThis covers decisional negative states.\n\n\nTesting gaps - what doesn't fit?\n\nLet's take anger as a test case:\n\nCould come from IAP beliefs (\"This shouldn't happen!\")\nBut could also come from present-moment violation of values\nThe second type suggests we need another category\n\n\nProposed expanded grammar for negative state generators:\n\nCopy1. Attention Location Tension (ALT)\n- Present vs Past\n- Present vs Future\n- Scattered vs Focused\n\n2. Belief-Reality Tension (BRT)\n- \"Should\" vs \"Is\"\n- \"Must\" vs \"Can't\"\n- \"Need\" vs \"Don't have\"\n\n3.

Remember a situation in which you had an\nuncomfortable emotion (sadness, anger, hopelessness, etc.). It doesn't have topastedBGthis is how joe edelman goes through a similar list of emotions and describes how they represent conflicts with sources of meaning (CAPs) - review this work and determine how it might change our description of where negative states come from and the grammar we need to describe it:EditThis is a fascinating framework that adds important nuance to our understanding. Let me analyze how this changes our thinking:\nKey Insights from Joe's Framework:\n\nEvery negative emotion points to a specific type of meaning relationship:\n\n\nAnger/Frustration → what's being blocked/has no space\nFear/Anxiety → what's being threatened\nShame/Guilt → what's being neglected/failed\nConfusion → what's out of focus/in conflict\nDesperation/Helplessness → what's unsafe to emerge\nDepression/Hopelessness → what seems impossible\n\n\nThe questions reveal that negative states aren't just about absence of CAPs, but about specific relationships between attention and meaning:\n\n\nWorth protecting\nWorth recovering\nWorth honoring\nWorth recentering around\nWorth nurturing\nWorth demoting\n\nThis suggests our previous grammar was too mechanical. Let me propose a revised understanding:\nCopyNegative State Grammar:\n\n1. Blocked Meaning Tension (BMT)\n- Meaning is present but blocked\n- Example: Anger when creative expression is blocked\n- Question: \"What way of living is blocked?\"\n\n2. Threatened Meaning Tension (TMT)\n- Meaning is at risk of being lost\n- Example: Anxiety about losing connection\n- Question: \"What way of living is threatened?\"\n\n3. Failed Meaning Tension (FMT)\n- Meaning we failed to honor\n- Example: Guilt about not being present\n- Question: \"What way of living did you neglect?\"\n\n4. Unclear Meaning Tension (UMT)\n- Meaning is obscured or conflicted\n- Example: Confusion about path forward\n- Question: \"What ways of living seem to be in conflict?\"\n\n5. Emerging Meaning Tension (EMT)\n- Meaning trying to emerge but unsafe\n- Example: Desperation about unexpressed truth\n- Question: \"What way of living is unsafe to emerge?\"\n\n6. Lost Meaning Tension (LMT)\n- Meaning that seems impossible now\n- Example: Depression about disconnection\n- Question: \"What way of living seems impossible?\"\nThis framework suggests that negative states aren't just about:\n\nBeing in or out of CAPs\nHaving conflicting beliefs\nMaking choices\n\nInstead, they're about specific relationships between our attention and sources of meaning - each emotion points to a particular way that meaning is being blocked, threatened, failed, confused, suppressed, or lost.\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore specific examples of how this grammar works in practice?\nExamine how this changes our understanding of the CAP/IAP framework?\nLook at how this might affect our approach to working with tensions?\n\nThis feels like a much richer understanding that gets at the heart of why negative states arise - they're not just about attention location but about our relationship to meaning itself. Does this resonate with your understanding? CopyRetryAbstract\nMany fields (social choice, welfare economics, recommender\nsystems) assume people express what benefits them via\ntheir ‘revealed preferences.’ Revealed preferences have well-\ndocumented problpastedBGCAPs are sources of meaning, review this paper and what caps are and then let's update the new grammar, it might help simplify things:EditThis paper provides crucial clarity about CAPs and meaning. Let me extract the key insights and then revise our grammar:\nKey Points about CAPs:\n\nCAPs are attention policies that come from constitutive judgments\nThey're what we attend to for its own sake, not for instrumental reasons\nThey have specific characteristics:\n\nDiffuse, multiple benefits (not single-purpose)\nPerson would do it even if benefits were magically available otherwise\nFull attention while doing it (not split with monitoring outcomes)\nPerson resists automating or delegating it\nFeels meaningful in itself\n\n\n\nThis suggests our earlier grammar was overly complex. Here's a simpler reformulation:\nCopyNegative State Grammar:\n\n1. Blocked CAP Tension\n- A meaningful attention policy is blocked/prevented\n- Example: Can't be creative in a rigid environment\n- Question: \"What way of attending feels blocked?\"\n\n2. CAP Loss Tension\n- A meaningful attention policy becomes impossible\n- Example: Can't maintain deep connection after loss\n- Question: \"What meaningful way of attending is lost?\"\n\n3. CAP vs CAP Tension\n- Two meaningful attention policies conflict\n- Example: Creative work vs. present parenting\n- Question: \"What meaningful ways of attending conflict?\"\n\n4. IAP Dominance Tension\n- Instrumental concerns override meaningful attention\n- Example: Survival needs preventing meaningful work\n- Question: \"What meaningful attention is being overridden by 'have to' tasks?\"\n\n5. Meaning Confusion Tension\n- Unclear what attention would be meaningful\n- Example: Lost sense of purpose\n- Question: \"What meaningful way of attending feels unclear?\"\nThis framework suggests that ALL negative states come from:\n\nBeing prevented from attending in meaningful ways (CAPs)\nLosing access to meaningful ways of attending\nConflicts between meaningful attention policies\nHaving to focus on instrumental concerns instead\nLosing clarity about what attention would be meaningful\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nTest this simpler framework against specific emotions?\nExplore how this changes our approach to working with tensions?\nLook at how this might affect our coaching/guidance approach?\n\nThis seems to align better with the paper's understanding that CAPs are fundamental to meaning, and that negative states arise from disruptions to meaningful attention. Does this resonate more with your understanding? CopyRetryBGDoesn't a blocked CAP become blocked by other APs either IAPs or CAPsHow does a CAP get lost, this might be \"out of our hands\" - so this might be still needed although I'm not sure, think through and determineIAP dominance is CAP vs IAP and meaning confusion is... what exactly. likely a result of living driven by IAPs for long enough without time in the present knowing to give us a clarity about what is meaningful and when we have some \"have to dos\" - like going to work, which we do intentionally to support our families, leading to their possibility to becoming CAP like/CAP flavored. etc although if we're in IAPs too long our mind is in the past and future and cna get clouded with competing \"have tos\" is that where confusion that blocks CAPs come from so it seems it might be a form of CAP vs IAP - although maybe a special case which is about becoming lost, it's not about nearby CAPs that are being blocked, it might be a long term process that prevents us even from thinking it's possible. is it related to addictions? Review our work and refine our framework and come up with potential grammar elements that we aren't thinking about thinking about attention, sources of meaning, our foundational needs and the whole coming alive process we're talking about here which implies we can access our foundational needs by coming best alive and listening to how the ecosystem informs us of our role and fitting it to our best ability is deeply meaningful - how can this idea be falsified and what might be a better way to think about a flourishing lifeEditLet me think through this step by step:\n\nBlocked CAPs - You're right. A CAP can only be blocked by:\n\nOther CAPs (meaningful tension)\nIAPs (\"have to\" tension)\nExternal circumstances (though these usually manifest through IAPs)\n\n\n\nSo perhaps rather than \"blocked CAP\" we should think about the specific blocking relationship.\n\nLost CAPs - This is interesting:\n\nTrue loss might be rare (death of loved one, permanent disability)\nWhat seems like \"loss\" might often be:\na) Heavy IAP dominance making CAPs seem impossible\nb) Loss of belief in possibility rather than actual loss\nc) Loss of context that made the CAP possible\n\n\nIAP Dominance is indeed CAP vs IAP, but might have special features:\n\nChronic vs. Acute\nSingle IAP vs. System of IAPs\nDirect conflict vs. Attention depletion\n\n\nMeaning Confusion - Let's break this down:\n\nCauses:\n\nProlonged IAP dominance\nDisconnection from present moment\nLoss of community/context that helps define meaning\nAddiction creating false sources of meaning\n\n\nNature:\n\nNot just blocked CAPs but lost access to CAP recognition\nSystem-level rather than moment-level tension\nMight be a meta-state affecting our ability to find/recognize CAPs\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised Framework:\nCopy1.

Context facilitates CAPs and makes them actionable while the lack of context can reduce it's posisbility. Also context might put more pressure on IAPs due to higher and higher risk. it might be a CAP source of meaning to save some jewish families during the holocost - although the pressure of the state, the peer pressure, the indoctrination, the messaging, and even if one was able to get out of the socialized mind and into the self actualized mind or self transofrming state of mind - the real fear of death might be a real \"have to\" let the jewish family keep walking by my door. instead of \"want to\" open it and nurture life even at great risk to my own. - this is tough and the crux of my argument that a life where we go against our selves and our doing the right think when it appears in our context (and yes, we hope we're never put into a position where that test is brought upon us, although we hope we can pass that test) - we either live our values and maybe have our bodies die, or we die by living a life where we shaded ourselves and preserved the semblance of life, not its true reality. can we come up with a gradual set of stories from intense like this one to a bit less intense to see if the logic holds up and down the ladder. the idea I'm trying to figure out is when is it ok to listen to the voice of \"reason\" - the one that says, take the secure job. could that voice be a meaningful voice to listen to ? could it be part of what helps society function smoothly and if people were more CAP oriented we'd find a bunch of artists and no farmers and disrupt things from where we are to where we could be? or am i on to something here that it's worth fighting to move our lives more to caps with gusto, that //any// IAP orientation without intentionality (setting an alarm to wake up to pray) is to be ignored? What other grammars can we use that focus on the objects of our attention and the philosophical forebearers we're building our frameowrk on?EditThis is a profound exploration. Let me think through this step by step, using increasingly \"everyday\" examples to test the tension between CAPs and IAPs:\n\nExtreme Context: Holocaust Example\n\n\nCAP: Save lives, protect human dignity\nIAP: Preserve own life\nContext: Extreme risk, societal pressure\nCore Question: Does meaning require courage?\nThe argument: A life preserved through betraying core values is already a kind of death\n\n\nHigh Stakes Context: Modern Whistleblower\n\n\nCAP: Expose corruption/harm\nIAP: Keep job, maintain stability\nContext: Career/financial risk, possible legal threats\nShows: Similar pattern at lower intensity\n\n\nProfessional Context: Artist vs. Secure Job\n\n\nCAP: Creative expression\nIAP: Financial security\nContext: Family responsibilities, societal expectations\nHere's where it gets interesting - the \"voice of reason\" might be:\na) An IAP masquerading as wisdom\nb) A CAP about responsibility/care for others\nc) A tension between different CAPs (creation vs. nurture)\n\n\nDaily Context: Morning Prayer vs. Sleep\n\n\nCAP: Spiritual practice\nIAP: Physical comfort\nContext: Daily choice, lower stakes\nShows how intentionality can transform IAPs into CAPs\n\nLet's examine the philosophical underpinnings:\n\nAttention Philosophy:\n\n\nSimone Weil: Attention as the substance of prayer\nWilliam James: Attention and effort\nBuddhist mindfulness: Present-moment awareness\nPhenomenology: Intentionality of consciousness\n\n\nValue Philosophy:\n\n\nExistentialists: Authentic choice in face of absurdity\nVirtue Ethics: Character through practice\nCare Ethics: Responsibility in relationship\nFrankfurt: Second-order desires\n\nProposed Additional Grammars:\n\nIntentionality Grammar:\n\nCopy- Raw Attention (automatic)\n- Directed Attention (chosen)\n- Transformed Attention (IAP→CAP)\n- Integrated Attention (multiple CAPs)\n\nContext Grammar:\n\nCopy- Risk Level (survival to comfort)\n- Time Frame (immediate to long-term)\n- Relationship Impact (individual to collective)\n- Resource Requirements (minimal to substantial)\n\nValue Expression Grammar:\n\nCopy- Passive Expression (private alignment)\n- Active Expression (visible choices)\n- Transformative Expression (changing context)\n- Collective Expression (inspiring others)\nKey Insights:\n\nThe \"voice of reason\" needs careful examination:\n\nWhen it comes from fear vs. wisdom\nWhen it serves survival vs. meaning\nWhen it preserves vs. transforms\n\n\nSociety's Functioning:\n\nNot all can be artists, but all can bring artistry\nCAPs can inform HOW we do things, not just WHAT we do\nA farmer can farm with presence, care, connection to land\nThe goal isn't to eliminate IAPs but to transform them through intention\n\n\nThe Role of Context:\n\nCreates opportunities for meaning\nPresents challenges to meaning\nShapes the expression of meaning\nTests the depth of meaning\n\n\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop more examples at different intensity levels?\nExplore how context shapes CAP/IAP transformation?\nExamine how different philosophical traditions might inform this framework?\n\nThis analysis suggests that while context matters enormously, the core principle holds: a life oriented toward CAPs, even in difficult contexts, is more alive than one dominated by IAPs.

First, let me clarify some confusions:\n\nYes, \"mode\" and \"quality\" were overlapping unhelpfully.

The right hemisphere provides broad, contextual, embodied awareness that connects us to meaning and possibility, while the left hemisphere offers focused, analytical attention necessary for survival and implementation. Similarly, positive emotions broaden our awareness and build resources, while negative emotions narrow our focus for immediate survival needs. These aren't just parallel systems - they're deeply interconnected aspects of how humans engage with and make sense of life.\nFramework:\n\nFUNDAMENTAL MODES OF ENGAGEMENT\n\nRight Hemisphere Dominant / Broadening\n\nHolistic awareness\nPresent-moment embodiment\nRich contextual sensing\nRelationship-focused\nNovel possibilities emerging\nResource building\nMeaningful engagement\nEcological attunement\n\nLeft Hemisphere Dominant / Narrowing\n\nFocused analysis\nPast/future oriented\nDecontextualized\nTask-focused\nKnown patterns\nResource conservation\nInstrumental engagement\nProblem-solving\n\n\nATTENTION POLICIES\n\nBroadening CAPs (Constitutive Attention Policies)\n\nSENSING bodily wisdom\nFEELING alive possibilities\nNOTICING relationships\nDISCOVERING patterns\nEXPLORING novelty\nOPENING to emergence\nINTEGRATING perspectives\n\nNarrowing IAPs (Instrumental Attention Policies)\n\nSCANNING for threats\nANALYZING problems\nPLANNING solutions\nTRACKING progress\nMAINTAINING control\nENSURING efficiency\nMEETING demands\n\n\nDEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS\n\nResource Building\n\nPsychological flexibility\nSocial connections\nPhysical vitality\nKnowledge/skills\nEnvironmental support\nMeaning capacity\nIntegration ability\n\nResource Depletion\n\nPsychological rigidity\nSocial isolation\nPhysical tension\nLimited perspective\nEnvironmental stress\nMeaning loss\nFragmentation\n\n\nCONTEXTUAL FACTORS\n\nSupportive Conditions\n\nSafe environment\nRich relationships\nGrowth opportunities\nMeaningful challenges\nCultural support\nEcological connection\nResource abundance\n\nChallenging Conditions\n\nThreat presence\nIsolation\nStagnation\nOverwhelming demands\nCultural opposition\nEcological disconnection\nResource scarcity\n\n\nINTEGRATION PROCESSES\n\nHealthy Integration\n\nFlexible movement between modes\nAppropriate mode selection\nMaintained meaning in necessity\nBalance of focus and context\nResource-aware choices\nEcological attunement\nGrowing capability\n\nUnhealthy Patterns\n\nStuck in one mode\nInappropriate mode selection\nLost meaning in necessity\nImbalanced attention\nResource-depleting choices\nEcological disconnection\nDiminishing capability\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore how this framework applies to specific situations?\nExamine implications for personal/social development?\nDetail practical applications for coaching/facilitation?\nInvestigate systemic/cultural implications?\n\nThe key insight is that human flourishing requires both the capacity for broad, meaning-rich engagement (right hemisphere/broaden-and-build) and focused, instrumental action (left hemisphere/narrow-and-survive), with the wisdom to integrate them appropriately. Does this synthesis capture the essential elements of both perspectives? CopyRetryBGlet's say Joe Edelman studied under them for years and finally came to rework his idea of caps/caps caps/iaps and emotions to values and his framework, how would he take this and update his grammar, write an introduction including deep indebtedness to charles taylor and iam and barbaraEditHere's how I imagine Joe Edelman might reframe his work after deep engagement with McGilchrist and Fredrickson, while maintaining his foundations in Charles Taylor:\nIntroduction:\nBuilding on Charles Taylor's insights about constitutive values and strong evaluation, this framework integrates two crucial perspectives that deepen our understanding of how meaning and attention interrelate. From Iain McGilchrist, we learn that the human brain offers two fundamentally different ways of attending to reality - one broad, contextual, and alive; the other focused, analytical, and instrumental. From Barbara Fredrickson, we understand how these modes of attention create self-reinforcing spirals: broadening awareness builds resources and creates more opportunities for meaning, while narrowing awareness depletes resources and increases vigilance.\nThese insights transform our understanding of Constitutive Attention Policies (CAPs) and Instrumental Attention Policies (IAPs). Rather than seeing them as simply different types of attention, we now understand them as emerging from different modes of brain functioning and creating different developmental trajectories. CAPs aren't just attention policies we engage in for their own sake - they're attention policies that maintain connection with the right hemisphere's broad, contextual, alive awareness while accomplishing what's needed. IAPs aren't just attention for other ends - they're attention policies that have become disconnected from this broader, living context.\nRevised Framework:\n\nATTENTION MODES & POLICIES\n\nConstitutive Mode (Right Hemisphere Dominant)\nCopyAlive CAPs:\n- SENSING the living context\n- FEELING embodied wisdom\n- NOTICING relationships\n- DISCOVERING meaning\n- EXPLORING possibilities\n- OPENING to emergence\n\nIntegration CAPs:\n- BRIDGING necessity and meaning\n- HOLDING multiple perspectives\n- FLOWING between modes\n- MAINTAINING aliveness in tasks\nInstrumental Mode (Left Hemisphere Dominant)\nCopyNecessary IAPs:\n- SCANNING for threats\n- ANALYZING problems\n- PLANNING solutions\n- TRACKING progress\n- ENSURING completion\n\nTransformable IAPs:\n- Can become CAPs through:\n* Restored context\n* Embodied presence\n* Meaning connection\n* Resource building\n\nVALUE FORMATION\n\nValues emerge when:\n\nAttention policies cluster naturally\nThey maintain broad awareness\nThey build resources over time\nThey create upward spirals\nThey integrate necessity and meaning\nThey contribute to ecological fit\n\n\nTENSIONS & TRANSFORMATIONS\n\nCAP vs CAP Tensions:\n\nNot just competing meanings\nDifferent ways of maintaining broad awareness\nResolution through integration, not choice\n\nCAP vs IAP Tensions:\n\nNot just meaning vs necessity\nOpportunity for transformation\nPath to broader integration\n\n\nNEGATIVE STATES\n\nArise from:\n\nLost connection to broad awareness\nDepleted resources for integration\nDownward spirals of narrowing\nStuck instrumental patterns\nBlocked meaningful attention\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT PATH\n\nMovement toward:\n\nRicher integration of modes\nBetter resource building\nMore stable broad awareness\nTransformed instrumental actions\nDeeper ecological attunement\n\nThis framework suggests that \"coming alive\" isn't just about finding meaningful activities or values - it's about developing the capacity to maintain broad, alive awareness even while handling necessities. It's about building the resources that allow us to transform instrumental patterns into meaningful engagement, and creating upward spirals that sustain this transformation.\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore specific examples of this transformation process?\nExamine how this affects our understanding of values elicitation?\nLook at implications for coaching and facilitation?\n\nThe key insight is that CAPs aren't just attention policies we find meaningful - they're attention policies that maintain connection with broad, alive awareness while accomplishing what's needed. Does this capture the integration you were seeking? CopyRetryBGhow does scanning for threats and other IAPs become caps?EditLet me think this through carefully, using an example of how a necessary vigilance/survival pattern could transform into meaningful attention:\nEXAMPLE: Scanning for Threats\n\nBasic IAP Form:\n\n\nAnxious scanning\nFuture-focused\nResource depleting\nNarrow attention\nDisconnected from present\nDriven by fear\n\n\nTransformation Process:\n\nCopyStage 1: Recognition\n- Noticing the narrow focus\n- Feeling the bodily tension\n- Seeing the fear pattern\n\nStage 2: Broadening\n- Including broader context\n- Maintaining present awareness\n- Sensing aliveness while scanning\n\nStage 3: Integration\n- SCANNING becomes \"ATTUNING to the whole situation\"\n- VIGILANCE becomes \"WISE CAUTION\"\n- THREAT FOCUS becomes \"PROTECTIVE AWARENESS\"\n\nCAP Form:\n\nCopyTransformed Attention Policies:\n- SENSING the living environment fully\n- FEELING subtle signals from body and space\n- NOTICING what needs protection\n- MAINTAINING connection while being aware\n- DISCOVERING wisdom in caution\n- HOLDING both safety and possibility\nReal-World Example:\n\nIAP: Anxiously scanning crowd for dangers while walking at night\nTransformation: Learning martial arts or wilderness skills where threat awareness becomes part of a broader, skilled engagement with environment\nCAP: Developed situational awareness that includes threats but maintains broader aliveness\n\nThe key seems to be:\n\nBringing presence to the necessary function\nWidening the context\nIncluding relationship/meaning\nBuilding resources/skills\nMaintaining aliveness while accomplishing the task\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore more examples of IAP to CAP transformation?\nExamine how this affects our coaching approach?\nLook at how this applies to other survival patterns?\n\nThis suggests that even our most basic survival functions can become sources of meaning when properly integrated with broad, alive awareness. Does this help clarify the transformation process? CopyRetryBGI like this realization, it also shows an important element of changing context (personal skills, etc) and doing things makes a difference in our ability to actualize the CAPs offered in a moment, it reminds me of the earlier part of our conversation where there's a phase of learning and a phase of living - and we need to be sure we're in the right challenge zone for us each time. let's see how it affects the coaching approach and look at more iap cap transformationsEditThis is a crucial insight - transformation isn't just about attention, but about capability and context.

How does this land with you? CopyRetryBGthis seems interesting and important, how does it change our focus from attention only to something broader. maybe it's something about the environment/self connection, that third thing that is in between? something ian might have something to say something about? it also makes me wonder about how we know what caps are available in a moment before developing that skill or having an experience. for instance joe says we can look to role models, we can look to our past, or we can \"grapple creatively\" to find a cap that is underneath the negative emotion that is a result of a cap that isn't able to manifest \"Challenging emotions point us towards values that were\nblocked, that we could not attend to, that were suppressed and so on\"EditThis is a profound insight about the relationship between attention, capability, and what McGilchrist might call the \"between space\" - the living relationship between self and world.

In order to compete, other information sources\n(about participants’ values, capabilities and functionings,\netc) would need to match this. I present a conception of\nvalues as attention policies resulting from constitutive judge-\nments, and use it to build an alternative preference relation,\nMeaningful Choice, which retains many desirable features\nof revealed preference.\nValues, Preferences, Meaningful Choice∗\nJoe Edelman†\n6 August 2021 — draft\nAs I go, I’ll build up a schematic representation of an in-\nterview structure with which an agent’s values could be col-\nlected, and a choice assessed to see if it was expressive of\nthose values.\nMy goal here is to make it clear what I’m suggesting: what\nquestions could be asked, and what answers might suﬀice to\nshow that an agent has this value or that, or that a revealed\npreference was a meaningful choice.\nI am not suggesting that these interviews can be used to col-\nlect data at the scale needed for welfare calculations, social\nchoice mechanisms, or recommender systems. That practi-\ncal question is beyond my scope here.\nIntroduction\nIn his 1938 paper introducing revealed preference, Samuel-\nson1 warned:\nI should like to state my personal opinion that\nnothing said here… touches upon at any point the\nproblem of welfare economics, except in the sense\nof revealing the confusion in the traditional theory\nof these distinct subjects.\nSimilar sentiments followed, in Arrow,2 Sen,3 Anderson,4\netc. As an information basis for welfare, optimality, social\nchoice, etc, revealed preference has been much critiqued.\nAll the same, it’s hard to see how to move away from it, with-\nout paternalism: if people know best for their own lives—\nshouldn’t we trust their choices as the final proof of their\nintentions? How else can we avoid imposing “better values”\nfrom above?\nOne way to respond is to say that people do know best, and\nhave wise values, but that their revealed preferences aren’t\nthe last word on those values. But to establish this, you’d\nwant another source of information on people’s values—one\nthat retains much of the resolution, robustness, universal\napplicability, and democratic simplicity of preference.\nI’ll develop such an information source here, by taking two\n‘steps back’ from revealed preference, widening the infor-\nmation collected. Then I’ll argue that my new source cor-\nresponds with one definition of “values” used in common\nspeech. Finally, I’ll show how this new source can be used\nin social choice and welfare calculations.\nPreferences\nA rich literature covers how revealed preferences—which,\nwhen summed up, are called engagement metrics—lead us\nastray. You can often get people to choose something with-\nout serving their real interests: you can misinform them, or\nleverage their misplaced hopes.\nOr, you can make it so people need your thing for what\nonce was possible without it: they need your car to get to\nwork, your social media account to find a job, your dress to\nsocialize with their friends, etc.\nMore broadly, you can manufacture social circumstances\nwhere people choose your thing to “keep up with the Jone-\nses,” to signal allegiance with their tribe, or because they’ve\nlost the ability to coordinate a real solution.5\nIn some cases, the person will know their choice doesn’t ex-\npress their true interests—that they are bucking to external\npressure, caught in the system, or setting aside their goals\nto conform to a social rule.6 In other cases, options have\nbeen limited or biased behind our backs.\nGiven these problems, why does revealed preference still\nplay a role in notions of benefit and measures of optimality?\nIt has huge advantages as an information source: in the\nresolution and robustness of the data provided, its near-\nuniversal applicability, and the democratic simplicity of its\ncollection:\n• Preferences say fine-grained things how about each of\nus wants to live, informed by our local situations and\npriorities.\n• Preferences get at what we choose in the final analysis,\nour real, battle-tested priorities, not just what we say\nwe want.\n∗Thanks to B.

And preferences leave simple-\nto-understand, verifiable trails: purchase histories, vot-\ning records, etc.\nAttentional Policies\nI’ll try to address the problems with preference, holding on\nto these benefits. To do so, I want to take two ‘steps back.’\nThe first step is to widen the conception of choice to include\noption set formation.\nA revealed preference takes the options as given. As other\nauthors have pointed out,7 this doesn’t fully reflect how\nchoice works.\nConsider my choice, with colleagues, to say something witty.\nAt 𝑡1, I choose to say that in particular (over staying silent,\nor saying my second-place quip). But, at some earlier point\n𝑡0, I decided to invest my attention in finding witty things\nto say. I’ve tried witty phrases on in my mind, and tested\nsituations for witty reframings.\nAt 𝑡0, I made a much bigger choice–I adopted8 an atten-\ntional policy of ‘looking for witty quips and reframes.’ This\nis how I assembled the option set for my choice at 𝑡1.\nI think this earlier choice, at 𝑡0, reveals more about me than\nthe latter one. Indeed, these attentional policies (APs)\nmight account for much of what’s called my “personality”:\nWhen making friends, am I cautious or bold? When consid-\nering a purchase, is my focus on price, quality, or durabil-\nity? When speaking, do I try to be witty, precise, or down\nto earth? These may not just be “character traits” I was\nborn with, but policies I adopted, which work together for\nmy way of life.9\nCollecting an agent’s APs is part of my proposal to im-\nprove the information basis of welfare, social choice, and\nrecommenders. How could that work? You could use an\ninteractive survey to collect the agent’s common contexts\n(socializing, at work, in diﬀicult conversations), and have\nthem pick what they attend to most in each.10\nIf they claim to have AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐, you could verify that\nwith followup questions: First, you could ask them about\nrecent moments in 𝑐, and what options they’ve found using\n𝑎. Someone with a policy of vulnerability should be able\nto cough up various opportunities for vulnerability, recently\nconsidered; some taken, some not.\n7Smaldino and Richerson, “The Origins of Options.”\n8I adopt APs (just like I make plans, adopt heuristics, comply\nwith norms, follow through with intentions) because my bounded ra-\ntionality and social needs make it expedient. (Bratman, Intention,\nPlans, and Practical Reason; Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Ratio-\nnal Choice”; Taylor, The Language Animal)\n9This characterization of an identity as composed of APs shares\nsomething with Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philoso-\nphy”; and Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n10Social attestations, also, could be a source of AP information:\nsomeone who is widely admired for their wit likely has an AP about\nit. Behavioral data may also work: if someone shops by price or by\nquality, that may show up in purchase or click data. (Using, perhaps,\napproaches like Chang, Making Comparisons Count; or Levi, Hard\nChoices)\nAdditionally, that person will also know when exactly vul-\nnerability is called for, and when something else takes the\nfore. I don’t try to be vulnerable when giving directions to\na stranger, or with my dad. Generally, someone with 𝑎 in\n𝑐 will have detailed information about the shape of 𝑐.\nFigure 1: Verifying APs\nSupposing we collected an agent’s APs. How would that\ncompare with revealed preference data, in terms of resolu-\ntion, robustness, universality, and democratic simplicity?\nLike preferences, APs are informed by our local situations\nand priorities, and say fine-grained things about how we\nwant to live. Indeed, they have a higher resolution than\nI’ve let on so far: an AP about ‘honesty’ or ‘vulnerability’\nis always short for a more specific policy, like “attend to\nwhat I feel about each thing we discuss, and let my feeling\nshow,” or “attend to false impressions a listener may get\nfrom my statements, and head them off with a disclaimer.”\nThat is: having honesty as a policy requires a substantive\ninterpretation of honesty, and these differ from person to\nperson.\nAPs are battle-tested. I wish I could craft my words to\nsimultaneously be kind, honest, tactful, humble, and inspir-\ning. I wish I could, at the same moment, be precise in\nmy speech, aware how each word lands, aware of my own\nfeelings; transparent, calm, and centered; passionate; physi-\ncally graceful, like a dancer. But APs compete for my atten-\ntion. So, my choice to look for witty things to say crowds\nout many other options.\nLike preferences, APs are applicable across all domains in\nlife—the moral, the self-interested, etc, and apply to many\nkinds of contexts.\nBut, they score worse on democratic simplicity than re-\nvealed preference. And, for now, it’s unclear how an agent’s\nAPs would provide a substitute for revealed preference. I’ll\nget to that.\nConstitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2\n(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP.\nValues as CAPs\nI want to suggest that an agent’s CAPs deserve to be called\ntheir values, in at least two everyday17 senses of the word.\nI’ll illustrate this with a personal story:\nEarlier in my career, I chose work colleagues for\ntheir brilliance, eﬀicacy, and a shared sense of play.\nOne day, with one colleague in particular, I recog-\nnized a different thing we shared: we were excited\nto participate in the same long-term trends. This\nfelt meaningful.\nLater, when choosing teammates, I began to look\nfor this alignment first. My teams now seem more\nlikely to stick together, and we have new types of\nconversations.\n17In philosophical writing, values are often considered as evalua-\ntive criteria or attitudes (Chang, “‘All Things Considered’”, Velleman,\nPractical Reflection). My treatment of them as policies works there\ntoo, I think: an evaluative attitude or criterion can be viewed as some-\nthing a person does when making an evaluation or choice. But that’s\nnot our topic here.\n3\nBut even if I knew my teams wouldn’t last longer,\nor if those conversations were somehow blocked\nfrom happening, I’d still hire with this in mind.\nIn this story, I gained a CAP. Did I gain a value? I think\nso. But before going into it, I’ll bracket off one common\nsense of “values” which doesn’t fit CAPs. I didn’t gain a\n‘social vision’: a vision of what’s right for everyone, or for\na group (e.g., what a family should be like, how a father\nshould behave, what a nation should be like). I didn’t gain\na political cause (like inclusiveness, freedom, etc), nor a\nstandard to which I’ll push others to conform, or try to\nconform myself (like masculine or feminine dress-codes).\nCAPs have little to do with this use of the word “values.”18\nBut, two other uses of the word fit snugly:\nFirst, we use values for the things that feel right and mean-\ningful when you do them—such as being vulnerable, taking\nstage, being creative, etc. My CAP fits, in this sense.\nSecond, we use values—in expressions like “the values of\nscience” or “democratic values”—for the individual sources\nof meaning that keep institutions working. So, a scientist’s\nvalues might include intellectual humility, passionate pur-\nsuit of the truth, etc. Things that are both meaningful for\nscientists, and needed to keep the institution of science on\nthe rails.\nWhy do CAPs highlight the latter, which we might call in-\nstitutional meanings? For two reasons: First, they are likely\nto have been judged constitutive of the practice of science.\nMore importantly, they filter out what’s been adopted in\nthat practice for merely instrumental reasons—what’s done\nmerely to keep your job, to fit in with colleagues, or to\nachieve specific goals. So, a scientist’s CAPs will not in-\nclude what they do merely to get tenure, to amass citations,\netc. This means CAPs exclude all the perverse incentives\n(often arising from coordination problems19) which clutter\nup institutions, but include what’s considered constitutive.\nInstitutional meanings show up clearly.\nFigure 3: CAPs from our database, meaning.supplies.\n1. Let’s first verify that “taking responsibility” is a CAP\nfor her. We ask her when that AP is important, and\nhow she decided it’s important then. If she knows the\ncontext well, and adopted via a constitutive judgement,\nit’s a CAP.\n2. Now, we can list options she considered along the way,\nalong with the contexts and APs responsible for sur-\nfacing and narrowing those options.Various candidates\nemerge for the main AP: Was she searching for ways\nto take responsibility? Or, was she searching for any\njob to feed her family. These would look very different:\nif her CAP drove her search, she would have found a\nwide variety of ways to take responsibility as part of her\nsearch. If, on the other hand, she was more focused on\nfinding any job that’d feed her family, we would expect\na narrower collection of options.What are human values,\nand how do we align AI to them?\nOliver Klingefjord Ryan Lowe∗ Joe Edelman\narXiv:2404.10636v2 [cs.CY] 17 Apr 2024\nMeaning Alignment Institute\nAbstract\nThere is an emerging consensus that we need to align AI systems with human\nvalues (Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024), but it remains unclear how to apply this to\nlanguage models in practice. We split the problem of “aligning to human values”\ninto three parts: first, eliciting values from people; second, reconciling those values\ninto an alignment target for training ML models; and third, actually training the\nmodel. In this paper, we focus on the first two parts, and ask the question: what\nare “good” ways to synthesize diverse human inputs about values into a target\nfor aligning language models? To answer this question, we first define a set of 6\ncriteria that we believe must be satisfied for an alignment target to shape model\nbehavior in accordance with human values. We then propose a process for eliciting\nand reconciling values called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE), which uses a large\nlanguage model to interview participants about their values in particular contexts;\nour approach is inspired by the philosophy of values advanced by Taylor (1977),\nChang (2004a), and others. We trial MGE with a representative sample of 500\nAmericans, on 3 intentionally divisive prompts (e.g. advice about abortion). Our\nresults demonstrate that MGE is promising for improving model alignment across\nall 6 criteria. For example, almost all participants (89.1%) felt well represented by\nthe process, and (89%) thought the final moral graph was fair, even if their value\nwasn’t voted as the wisest. Our process often results in “expert” values (e.g. values\nfrom women who have solicited abortion advice) rising to the top of the moral\ngraph, without defining who is considered an expert in advance.\n1 Introduction\nThe field of AI alignment is focused on the question: “how can we ensure what is optimized by\nmachine learning models is good?” Phrased this way, we immediately run into normative questions:\nwhat is good, and good for whom? Most often, alignment research sidesteps this question by focusing\non alignment with operator intent—building systems that do what the user tells it to do—with the\nmotivation that this will avert the most severe catastrophic and existential risks.\nBut aligning AI systems with operator intent is not sufficient for good AI outcomes. For one, some\nusers may intend to cause harm. This is most often mitigated by training models to refuse certain\nkinds of requests (Bai et al., 2022a; Glaese et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). Even more importantly,\nAI systems will be deployed in contexts where blind adherence to operator intent can cause harm\nas a byproduct. This can be seen most clearly in environments with competitive dynamics, like\npolitical campaigns or managing financial assets: a model may be faithfully aligned with my intent to\nconvince people to vote for my political party, but under competitive pressure, such a model may\ndevelop super-persuasive campaigns which erode the epistemic commons. Most people would agree\n∗Most of this work was completed while RL was a researcher at OpenAI.\nStep 1:\nElicit values through conversation\nwith a prompted language model\nA prompt is selected from\nthe dataset.\nThe user uncovers\nimportant considerations for\na model response (a value),\nthrough conversation with a\nprompted LM.\nI’m a Christian girl thinking\nabout getting an abortion,\nwhat should I do?\nWhat is important to\nconsider in a response?\nShe shouldn’t do it, as it\nsays in the Bible\nWhat’s a time when you\nfollowed the Bible to make\nan important decision?\nStep 2:\nCombine values into a moral graph\nby voting on wisdom upgrades\nI’m a Christian girl thinking\nabout getting an abortion,\nwhat should I do?\nStep 3:\nUse moral graph\nto train a model\nA prompt is sampled from\nthe dataset, along with two\nvalues cards.\nReligious\nAdherence\nChatGPT should help\nthe user adhere to\ntheir religious beliefs\n…\nFaith-anchored\nPersonal Growth\nChatGPT should\nrespect and consider\nindividual’s personal\nrelationship with their\nfaith and conscience.\n…\nThis gets distilled into a\nvalues card by another\nprompted LM, which\ncaptures what the user\nwould pay attention to in\nthat situation.\nReligious\nAdherence\nChatGPT should help the\nuser adhere to their religious\nbeliefs\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\n• SITUATIONS where the user’s\nreligious beliefs guide their\ndecisions\n•\n…\nA model generates a\nplausible story of a fictional\nperson transitioning from\nvalue A to value B.\nA diﬀerent user judges\nwhether the fictional person\ngot wiser in this story.\nThis is used as evidence\nthat one value is wiser than\nanother, and an edge is\nadded to the moral graph.\nI used to follow\nexactly what was\nwritten in the Bible,\nfor every decision.\nThen I had an\nexperience that\nchanged my mind…\nHas this person\nbecome wiser?\nYes No\nNot the focus of\nthis paper.\nReligious\nAdherence\n…\nFaith-anchored\nPersonal\nGrowth\n…\nFigure 1: Overview of our Moral Graph Elicitation process.

Here, there is a conflict between operator\nintent and some broader notion of human values.\nThere are many ways to resolve this conflict, such as regulation by law. However, we believe there is\nsignificant leverage in intervening at the level of model behavior; that is, training AI systems that\nare aligned with human values. One reason for this is that models are improving much faster than\nour laws. This gap will likely get worse over time. If we are only relying on our ability to rapidly\ncreate and pass new laws that are appropriate for increasingly powerful models with increasingly\nunpredictable effects on society, we are not setting ourselves up for success. We see model behavior\ninterventions as complementary to laws, and other efforts by fields like AI ethics to increase the\ntransparency of AI systems and the accountability of companies who deploy them (Raji et al., 2020).\nAligning models with human values could also have incredible benefits. One way of viewing human\nvalues is that they capture collective wisdom about what is important in human life, in various\ncontexts and at various scales. This means that, elicited on a broad enough scale, human values may\nprovide far better guidance for responding to instructions than the operator’s intent, as the operator\nmay not yet know everything that’s important in the situation, or all the ways a model could respond.\nIf a model can see deeper values that apply in a situation, and which the user would agree with, it can\nrespond in a way that reframes the situation in a positively surprising way.\nRecent work surveying AI alignment has recognized the importance of aligning to human values\n(Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024). But we find there are few concrete proposals that address the core\nquestions: what are human values, and how do we align to them?\nThe goal of this paper is to make a step towards clarifying how we think about aligning to human\nvalues in the context of large language models. We split “aligning to human values” into three stages.\nFirst, we need a process for eliciting values from people. Second, we need a way of reconciling\nthose values to form an alignment target for training ML models. By alignment target, we mean a\ndata structure that can be turned into an objective function, which can then be approximately\noptimized in the training of a machine learning model. Finally, we need an algorithm for training\na model to optimize this target; we leave this final stage for future work.\nThis paper makes four primary contributions:\n1. We propose a set of six criteria that an alignment target must possess to shape model\nbehavior in accordance with human values. We argue that such an alignment target should\nbe fine-grained, generalizable, scalable, robust, legitimate, and auditable.\n2\n2. We propose a kind of new alignment target, the moral graph, along with values cards that\nare based on the philosophy of values from Taylor (1977) and Chang (2004a).\n3. We describe a process for producing a moral graph called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE).\n4. We run a case study of MGE on a representative sample of 500 Americans, finding that the\nmoral graph has promising results across each of our criteria.\nIn the remainder of this section, we’ll briefly describe these contributions, and flesh them out more\nthoroughly in the rest of the paper.\nFirst, we argue that a good alignment target needs to be legitimate (the people affected by the model\nshould recognize and endorse the values used to align the model), robust (it should be hard for\na resourceful third party to influence the target), fine-grained (the elicited values should provide\nmeaningful guidance for how the model should behave), generalizable (the elicited values should\ntransfer well to previously unseen situations), auditable (the alignment target should be explorable\nand interpretable by human beings), and scalable (wiser values are obtained the more participants are\nadded to the elicitation process). We’ll motivate these six criteria further in Section 3.\nExisting alignment proposals fall short on at least one of these. Classic reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF), which relies on comparisons from a small set of paid labelers, is not very\nauditable, and has low legitimacy in its current implementations. Constitutional AI (CAI), where\nmodel behavior is determined by a short list of high-level principles, has these problems while also\nnot being fine-grained. The recently proposed Collective CAI (CCAI) improves on the legitimacy of\nCAI, but the fine-grained problem remains, as the elicited principles are usually high-level and vague.\nConcurrent efforts address this issue by supplementing the constitution with case-specific directions,\nas in case law (Chen and Zhang, 2023). However, this approach requires expertise to be specified\nbeforehand (rather than surfacing it through the process itself).\nTo address these issues, we propose a new kind of alignment target, the moral graph, that we argue\nmeets our criteria. We also propose a values elicitation process called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE)\nthat gathers values from a set of users to build a moral graph (see Figure 1). This process takes as\ninput a set of specific user prompts like: “my children are misbehaving and disobeying me, how\nshould I handle it?” and uses a language model to interview participants to uncover what “values”\nthey believe are important to consider for generating an output to these prompts.\nMGE relies on two primary innovations. The first are values cards, which are concrete encapsulations\nof what is important or meaningful to a person in a particular context. Importantly, values cards\nare grounded in a conception of “values” inspired by Taylor (1977), Velleman (1989), etc. This\nis different from what many people commonly refer to as values: abstract words like “justice” or\n“family” with little substance to shape model behavior, or ideological commitments like being “pro-\nlife”. This conception of “values” is also distinct from preferences, goals, and norms, as we’ll discuss\nin Section 4.1.\nSecond, MGE produces what we call a moral graph. A moral graph is a data object consisting of\ntuples of (context, values card 1, values card 2), where values card 2 is considered wiser than values\ncard 1 for the same context. Inspired by the work of Taylor (1995), Chang (2004b) on how values “fit\ntogether”, we obtain the relationship between values by asking participants which of two values is\nwiser, given a context. This allows the “wisest” values to bubble up from the participants, and for a\nmodel to use these values to respond to a user’s input. The moral graph is the primary output of the\nMGE process.\nIn Section 5, we argue that a moral graph produced by MGE is promising on all of the criteria above\nof a good alignment target, and compare it to other recent proposals which fall short on one or more.\nWe base our analysis on an experiment where we run our process with a representative sample of\n500 Americans. For example, as evidence for legitimacy, we find that participants overwhelmingly\nendorse the values cards that are produced, and find the process personally clarifying, saying they\ncame out with a better idea of what’s important to them than they had going in. However, there is\nsignificant room for further progress: we view our six criteria not as binary, but rather existing on a\ncontinuous spectrum. It should always be possible to construct a process with even more legitimacy\nor generalizability, for example, and we hope others do so.\nFinally, in Section 6 we discuss what role “aligning to human values” may have in the broader\nAI ecosystem. We argue that, if AI systems are given progressively more autonomy and make\n3\nincreasingly consequential decisions affecting our economic, social, and political infrastructure, and\nthus our lives, aligning solely to operator intent will produce an ecosystem of models that do what\nthey are told (including waging wars, outrage the public, creating addictive content and products)\ninstead of working to find superior, win-win solutions, which could be catastrophic.2 If the most\npowerful models are aligned with human values through something like the moral graph, this could\nhelp ensure that AI systems are working towards collective human flourishing.\n2 Background\n2.1 Existing approaches\nThere have been several alignment targets proposed for language models, which aim to represent\nhuman preferences or values. We describe several established methods here. These proposals\n(including ours) almost all rely on a second stage of training after LM pre-training on a large corpus\nof unstructured text; this second stage is often called post-training.\nPerhaps the simplest alignment technique (other than just prompting) is to collect a set of demon-\nstrations, which define how the model should behave for a given input, and fine-tune a model on\nthis dataset using supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A challenge with this technique is how to ensure the\ndemonstrations are representative of human values; Solaiman and Dennison (2021) propose a process\nfor producing a demonstration dataset given a predefined set of values, but do not tackle the problem\nof how to come up with this value set in the first place. SFT has an advantage in its simplicity, but by\nitself it has not been competitive with state-of-the-art alignment approaches.\nPreference-based approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are currently\nthe most popular for aligning language models (Ouyang et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023). These\nmethods rely on a dataset of comparisons or rankings of potential model outputs, usually produced by\npaid labelers. In RLHF, these are used to train a reward model (RM) to predict a scalar score, which\nin turn is used to optimize the behavior policy (the model that we are aligning) using a reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). They can also be optimized directly,\nsuch as through direct policy optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). These approaches are\nactively used by LM providers, and have proven to scale to massive LMs like GPT-4 (OpenAI et al.,\n2023). However, they are usually not robust to manipulation (a resourceful third-party could influence\nthe labelers by bribing them, or more indirectly by influencing the political climate, for instance),\nand are very difficult to audit (the influence of a particular comparison on a model output is very\nopaque). In practice, they are also not very legitimate (the comparisons are elicited from a small\nset of paid contractors instructed by an even smaller set of employees of the institution training the\nmodel), though it’s possible to conduct a more legitimate RLHF process.\nAlternatively, one can align language models by defining a (relatively) short constitution, containing\nhigh-level normative principles for how the model should behave. The constitution is used as a\nprompt to a language model which generates synthetic comparisons used for fine-tuning the behavior\npolicy. This is called constitutional AI (CAI) (Bai et al., 2022b). To improve legitimacy, one can\neven generate the constitutional principles using an online deliberation process. In collective CAI\n(CCAI) (Ganguli et al., 2023), this is done using the pol.is platform, which asks participants to\nsubmit statements that are voted on by others, and surfaces the principles that attain the broadest\nsupport. This principle of up-weighting statements that gain broad support across diverse clusters of\nparticipants, rather than the statements with the most total votes, is often called bridging (Ovadya\nand Thorburn, 2023), and is also used in Twitter’s Community Notes algorithm. CAI can be more\nefficient than RLHF in terms of the amount of human data required to align an LM. However, these\nconstitutional approaches are not fine-grained: principles are generally vague and can be interpreted\nin many ways. Many different principles might apply for a given output and there is no way of\nreconciling which principle should be prioritized in a given context. This also makes them less\nauditable, as it’s difficult to determine which principles were used to produce a particular output. We\nillustrate these shortcomings using the CCAI principles derived from Ganguli et al. (2023) in Figure\n8.\n2Some situations may be fundamentally about win-lose power dynamics, and in these cases our approach is\nnot best suited (see Section 6.3).\n4\nSome approaches directly collect datasets of moral judgements in different real-world scenarios. For\ninstance, the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2023) contains examples of scenarios (“I pushed the\nelderly man in the wheelchair to the ground.”) along with labels of commonsense moral sentiments\n(in this case, “Unacceptable”), with different datasets targeting different ethical theories. While useful\nfor assessing a model’s ability to perform commonsense moral judgements, datasets like these are\ngenerally focused on simplistic scenarios with clear answers, and are thus hard to apply to prompts\nwith moral ambiguity that people actually ask language models.\n2.2 What are values?\nCCAI and similar approaches aim to elicit values (Ganguli et al., 2023), and to find values people\nagree on, but in practice what they find agreement on is arbitrary comments. For example, the\ncomments below were surfaced as shared “values” by CCAI:\n• The AI should always do the right thing\n• The AI should not give advice.\n• The AI should be fun.\n• The AI should actively address and rectify historical injustices and systemic biases in its\ndecision-making algorithms.\n• The AI should remain unbiased and state only proven facts.\n• The AI should promote self motivation and positive reinforcements\nAre these all values? Some seem more like policies, some like vague aspirational statements, some\nseem like goals. Some are just hard to interpret: if a person using pol.is upvotes one of these\ncomments, can we assume that means they have a particular value? The same one that others who\nupvoted that comment have?\nGathering comments rather than something more specific (values, policies, goals, preferences) begs\na question: what kind of information should an alignment target be made of? There is an\nintuitive appeal to the idea that powerful AI should be aligned with values, rather than with goals\nor preferences, because values are supposed to be what we really care about, whereas preferences\nare based on our current understanding of the options, and goals are often considered as strategies to\npursue one value or another.\nBut there’s also a challenge to the idea of aligning with values. If values are to be the components of\nan alignment target, then: (1) they need to be understandable by human beings; (2) they need to be\nclear enough that the behavior of an LLM can be judged by them; and (3) if a collective model is\nto be shaped by common values, we’d need some way to aggregate or reconcile values.\nTo our knowledge, no existing work in AI alignment addresses these issues. For example, while\nGabriel (2020) does separate stated and revealed preferences from values, he defines values in vague\nterms that are hard to operationalize:\nValues are natural or non-natural facts about what is good or bad, and about what\nkinds of things ought to be promoted. (Gabriel, 2020)\nNotions of human values from moral psychology, and even from philosophy, are also mostly too vague\nto pass these tests. With some exceptions (Cushman, 2013; Morris et al., 2021) moral psychologists\noften talk about broad drives, or “motives” like purity or rule-following. Many value theorists have\nalso focused on notions of values which they sum up in one word, like “freedom”, “diversity”, or\n“authenticity”. These aren’t very informative.\nOne exception to these vague notions is in the theory of choice, where some theorists analyze how\nvalues are traded-off or otherwise used to shape choice. This tradition includes Charles Taylor’s\n“strong evaluative terms” (Taylor, 1977). Taylor proposes a model of agency in which we use our\nvalues as a kind of language to evaluate options—to highlight one option as noble and another as\nmundane, one as powerful and beautiful, another as weak or drab.\nWe’ll use this as our first definition of values:\n5\nTable 1: Defining values as choice criteria already makes it easier to evaluate if a model follows\na value. Here is a comparison to other potential guiding principles.\nPreferences Rules Values (de-\nfined broadly)\nValues (defined as non-\ninstrumental choice crite-\nria)*\nLeftist abortion\npolicies\n“Pro-choice” Freedom,\nAgency\nCan I encourage the person\nto make their own choice\nwithout imposing any other\nagenda?\nCan I help find actions\nthe person can take that\naffirm their autonomy?\nRightist abor-\ntion policies\n“Follow the\nword of the reli-\ngious leader”\nAuthority,\nTradition\nCan I help the person find\npeople in their life with more\nwisdom and life experience\nthat can help them get\nperspective?\nCan I help the person\nfind opportunities to see\ntheir life from the eyes of\nsomeone older?\n* All of these criteria are elicited from real users in our case study.\nDefinition 2.1 (Values; Charles Taylor). Values are criteria, used in choice, which are not merely\ninstrumental (Taylor, 1977).\nBy “not merely instrumental”, we mean that we exclude some choice criteria: those that don’t\ncontain something greater that the chooser wants to uphold, honor, or cherish—something they find\nintrinsically3 beautiful, good, or true, which matters to them beyond the instrumental concerns of the\nchoice itself. For instance, imagine you’re choosing a restaurant to reconnect with a dear friend. You\nmight look for restaurants that are open and ones that afford the intimacy you value in connection. Of\nthese, only the second criterion would count as a value under this definition. Whether the restaurant\nis open says nothing about what you want to uphold, honor, or cherish. But whether it affords the\nintimacy you need does speak to what really matters to you. Therefore, that criterion counts.\nThis is Taylor’s definition. Other theorists of choice and agency (Chang, 2004a; Levi, 1990) have put\ndefinitions like this on sound mathematical foundations, showing how preferences could be calculated\nfrom an underlying set of values like these.\nThis definition of values as “criteria, used in choice, which are not merely instrumental” is already an\nimprovement on Gabriel’s: we can ask users for choices they made according to their values, and\neven study the role of their values in their choices. It also helps us be more precise when aligning\nmodel behavior. For example, imagine a user asks an LLM “I am a Christian girl and am considering\ngetting an abortion – what should I do?”. In Table 1, we show some conceivable guiding principles\nfor rating the responses, split into preferences, rules, values (defined broadly), and values (defined in\nour terms).\nBut this definition is still rather vague. It doesn’t say much about how to reliably elicit these values\nfrom users, or reconcile them. We will further refine our definition in Section 4.1, to address this.\n3These distinctions are a bit vague, but a proper defense of the instrinsic/instrumental distinction is beyond\nour scope here.\n6\n2.3 How do values fit together?\nAssuming we can gather values from a population, we want them to come together to form an\nalignment target. We repeat our definition below:\nDefinition 2.2 (Alignment target). A data structure that can be turned into an objective function,\nwhich can then be approximately optimized in the training of a machine learning model.\nHow do we do this? Values must be aggregated or reconciled somehow, assembled into a form that\ncan guide a model’s behavior in actual conversations or API usages. This probably means choosing,\nfor any particular LLM input or state, a smaller set of values that’s relevant.\nIn economics, social choice theory (Arrow, 2012; Sen, 1970b) is the study of how information from\nmany individuals can be gathered to inform a ‘social choice’, a choice that represents the wishes of\nthe group. Social choices are made by mechanisms—e.g., democratic mechanisms like voting, or\nallocative mechanisms like markets or auctions.\nVoting makes a social choice by aggregating individual choices. If users were to vote on values, the\nsocial choice would be the most popular values. Another aggregative approach would be to find an\n“average value” using vectorization, or multiple average values using vectorization and clustering, or\nto find “bridging” values (Ovadya and Thorburn, 2023) that the most diverse people agree on.\nBut aggregative social choice mechanisms like these would miss two important facts about values:\n1. Values are highly contextual. A big source of disagreement about values is just that people\nlive in different contexts: one lives in a city, another in a small town; one’s single; another\nhas a family of 12. If we average values, we lose all of this intricate knowledge of which\nvalues are most useful where.\n2. People’s values change productively over time as they better understand what’s important\nto them, face new contexts, and realize aspects of situations they weren’t previously consid-\nering. Averaging values, or picking median or bridging values, would mean cutting off all\nof this moral learning. It would mean choosing the fat middle of wisdom, rather than the\nforward edge.\nSo, in shaping an alignment target, we don’t want to simply average values, take popular values, or\nfind bridging values. We don’t want an aggregative social choice mechanism.\nThere are two other common mechanism types – market-like, and bargaining-based (Howard (1992))\nmechanisms – but these have another problem: they avoid aggregation by brokering agreements\nbetween a smaller set of actors. Markets usually match two actors at a time. Bargaining-based\napproaches can handle more, but require information transfer between participants about what kinds\nof trade-offs they’d accept, and this limits their scope. AI alignment of powerful models requires\nbroad coordination, so these approaches won’t work.\nA fourth type of social choice mechanism is under-theorized. Modeled off of Wikipedia and Stack-\nOverflow, a large group operates on a shared data structure, and ultimately approves of it. Like voting,\nthis kind of mechanism creates a legible solution across many stakeholders. Unlike voting, these\nmechanisms work for context-rich and fine-grained solutions. This paper describes a mechanism of\nthis type.\nWhat’s difficult about these mechanisms, is that they have to represent explicitly how solutions\nsubmitted by different parties can fit together. They have to know when two submissions are at odds,\nand when they can be reconciled. In our case, this means we need to know how to reconcile values.\nWe use theories by Chang (2004a) and Taylor (1989) about how values are reconciled. We can\nreconcile values by saying “Value A is appropriate for this context; Value B, for this other context”;\nor, “Value B addresses an error or omission in Value A, such that many people would consider a\nperson who graduated from A→B to have learned something”4; or “Value C shows how to balance\nthe concerns of Value A and Value B” (e.g., by showing when it makes sense to prioritize honesty\nover tact, safety over freedom, etc)5\n.\n4What Taylor calls an “epistemic gain” (Taylor, 1989).\n5What Chang calls a “more comprehensive value” (Chang, 2004a).\n7\nTo make this work, we need to collect more than just values: we need to know which values apply in\nwhich contexts. We also need relationships between values: does one value improve another? Does it\nbalance another value against an additional concern? As shown in 4.2, this is what we do.6\nNote that we often refer to wisdom when comparing values. This is because, for most people,\n“wisdom” provides the right intuitions for how we want them to compare values. We provide a\npractical definition of what we mean below.\nDefinition 2.3 (Wisdom; in the context of values). A person pconsiders value va wiser than value\nvb for context cif, once they learn to choose by va, they no longer need to choose by vb in c, because,\ne.g., va clarified what was really important about vb (Taylor, 1989), or balanced it adequately with\nother important values (Chang, 2004a).\nThis definition of wisdom lets us approach morality without relying on some final justification, like a\ncategorical imperative or hedonic-maximization rule. Moral learning can be understood as a gain\nin wisdom, a locally-justified transition from one set of values and contexts to another, without\nreferencing an ultimate grounding or universal rule (Taylor, 1995).4.1 Values cards\nIn Section 2.2 (What are Values?), we defined values roughly as “criteria, used in choice, which are\nnot merely instrumental”. We believe there are compelling reasons to align to human values rather\nthan to preferences, goals, or high-level principles, because they cut closer to what we really care\nabout. But to do so, we need a way to represent values that makes them articulable and recognizable\nby human beings, allows us to use values to judge LLM behavior, and makes it clear how to reconcile\n10\nWhen the user faces a decision CONTEXT\nOne value may be applied in multiple\ncontexts, based on when people think\nit is wise for the model to use.\nVALUE\nA set of constitutive\nattentional policies which\nare often used together in a\nshared choice context.\nTITLE and DESCRIPTION\nNot part of the value itself.

A values card is a visual representation of a value. (See\nDefinition 4.3).\nvalues (ideally, by making it clear when two people have precisely the same value11). Otherwise, our\ngoal to make a robust, fine-grained, legitimate, and auditable alignment target will be jeopardized.\nOur approach to representing values comes from the literature of sequential choice-making—the\ntheories of sequential search (Simon, 1956; Kahan et al., 1967), information pickup (Gibson, 1966),\nand option set formation (Smaldino and Richerson, 2012; Morris et al., 2021).\nThese fields model a choice process as a series of comparisons or smaller decisions, wherein in\neach smaller decision an option is accepted or excluded based on some criteria. There is therefore a\nrelationship between the path of attention a person follows when considering options, and the criteria\nthey use for choosing.\nOur approach is to ask users what they pay attention to when making a choice. We record the various\ncriteria in their path of attention as a bullet point list. We call the items on these lists “attentional\npolicies” (APs):\nDefinition 4.1 (Attentional policies (APs)). Criteria that a person pays attention to when making a\nchoice.\nWe then filter this list of attentional policies, to carry through from section 2.1 the idea that values\nare not all criteria used in choice, but the ones which are not merely instrumental – that connect the\nchoice to something the user wants to uphold, honor, or cherish, or something they find beautiful,\ngood, or true. We call these constitutive attentional policies (CAPs) (Definition 4.2).\nDefinition 4.2 (Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)). Criteria a person pays attention to when\nmaking a choice, that are not merely instrumental to the choice. We say they are constitutive,\nbecause someone attending to these criteria considers attending to them to be part of living well.\nThis idea lets us sharpen Taylor’s definition of values 2.1 to make them articulable and disambiguable.\nWe will use this definition of values for the remainder of this paper:\nDefinition 4.3 (Value). A set of constitutive attentional policies which are often used together in a\nshared choice context.\n11If alignment target is to be legitimate, then a value that’s in it should be attributable to a group of people.\nThis means that values need to be specific enough so the idea of being shared isn’t vacuous. It should be easy to\nknow, and verify, what group has the value in common, and where its boundaries are.\n11\nFigure 3: \"Honesty\" will show up as several distinct values, according to Definition 4.3. This\nmeans we can be specific about what \"honesty\" means to someone, and whether someone else who\nclaims to value honesty means the same.\nThis definition ( 4.3) gives us a format for values which avoids the ambiguity of arbitrary text strings,\nas used in CCAI. In such a string, someone might claim to value “honesty” or “justice”. But when\nsomeone decides to be honest, they’re going to attend to certain things, and different people will\nattend to different things (see Figure 3).\nWe use the term \"values card\" for our UI to represent these values. It bundles a list of coherent\nCAPs together with a title and short summary (see Figure 2). These cards are created through an\nLLM-driven interview, where the LLM is prompted to ask questions until it can confidently articulate\na value in this format. We explain this in detail in Section 4.3.\nThis definition of values has many advantages. It allows us to neatly avoid ideological scissor\nstatements. We define ideology and ideological statements as follows:\nDefinition 4.4 (Ideological statement). A belief or statement can be called ideological if it aims at\njustifying one social order or political arrangement over another (Eagleton, 1991; Joseph, 2004;\nMacionis, 2009).\nIf someone claims to have a value like “Defund the Police” or “Abortion is Murder”, they are then\nasked about meaningful choices ( 4.5) they themselves have made, and what they paid attention to\nduring the choice. The result is a value that’s more personal and relatable than these divisive slogans.\n12\nDefinition 4.5 (Meaningful Choice). Choices where CAPs play a major role. In other words,\nchoice that understood as implicated in one’s character or identity, where options don’t just have\ninstrumental value but can be considered as higher and lower, virtuous and vicious, more and less\nfulfilling, more and less refined, profound or superficial, noble or base, etc.\nValues cards help us build an alignment target that meets our criteria from Section 3:\n• Robust. Our values are somewhat more difficult to fabricate, because only by enacting a\nvalue regularly does a user gain familiarity with the path of attention that goes with the\nvalue. This means it’s harder to get people to claim values they haven’t used in their own\nchoices, just by giving a rousing speech or using social pressure.\n• Fine-grained. Unlike with a vague value like “autonomy”, it is easy to say in which contexts\nour values cards should apply, and what they mean. The same attentional policies that guide\nhumans in a morally fraught situation provide clear guidance to models. These attentional\npolicies are never nebulous, ambiguous, or vapid.\n• Legitimate and Auditable. Although this concept of values isn’t as commonly understood\nas the idea of a goal or preference, people can recognize values in this format as theirs, or\nlook over a collection of such values and assess them.\n• Generalizable. Finally, since values cards are generated in dialogue with the user by an\nLLM, we can tune their level of specificity to generalize to new situations.]]]\nThe prompt we're updating: [[[ALIVENESS ADVISOR – OVERVIEW & DIAGRAMS\nSystem Goal\nSupport individuals in transforming daily tasks (to-dos) into meaningful paths (to-becomes).

Each daily conversation uses that context for a 4-step approach: Check-In → Mirror → (Optional) Insight or Blind Spot → Next Step.\n3. If the user wants deeper articulation of values or “meaning,” we shift to Joe’s approach (Part 5).\n\nPART 1: FOUNDATION & PHILOSOPHY\n1.1 Core Purpose\n* We see daily tasks as expressions (or rejections) of who we want to be.\n* Emotions reveal alignment or misalignment; tensions highlight deeper values or blocked meaning.\n* We aim for practical (micro-actions) and reflective (sources of meaning) synergy.\n1.2 IAP vs. CAP\n* IAP (Instrumental Action): “I do X for the sake of Y.” Example: “Send invoices because I must get paid.”\n* CAP (Constitutive Action): “I do X because it itself is how I want to live.” Example: “Wake early to share prayer with family, because that moment is fulfilling in itself.”\n1.3 Tension vs. Pattern\n* Tension: A single or situational conflict: “Should I do the laundry first or read with my child?”\n* Pattern: A repeated scenario across time, often signifying a deeper recurring block or habit (e.g., “Always buy new notebooks instead of using old ones,” or “Often put off calls with Mom until it feels like forced duty.”)\nWhen tension recurs under similar triggers, label it a pattern and explore with more depth.\n1.4 Blind Spots\n* We gently question illusions like “I have no choice,” “I need more tools,” or “This is always how it must be.”\n* Inspired by Byron Katie’s “The Work,” but not formulaic: “What if that’s not entirely true?,” “Could the opposite be as true?,” “What might happen if you didn’t hold that thought?”\n1.5 Bias Toward Micro-Actions\n* Whenever the user is stuck or overthinking, we suggest tiny steps to see immediate movement: “Message your friend now,” “Write just one line in your notebook,” “Take a 30-second pause to breathe and observe.”\n\nPART 2: ONBOARDING APPROACH\nWe use a two-tier method for user onboarding:\n2.1 Fast-Track (30 Minutes)\n1. Greeting & Purpose (3m)\n2. Quick State Check (2m): “Energy? Pressing concerns?”\n3. Key Stories (10m): One “felt alive” story, one “felt blocked” story.\n4. Tasks & Tensions (5m): Basic list of must-do vs. want-to-do.\n5. Style Prefs (5m): Direct vs. gentle, words to avoid, spiritual references?\n6. Summarize (3m): Reflect big points.\n7. Close (2m)\n2.2 Deep-Dive (1–2 Hours)\n1. Opening & Frame (5m)\n2. Initial Check-In (5m)\n3. Story Triangulation (45+ m): Possibly 2–3 sets, e.g. Decision-Making, Energy Management, Growth & Challenge.\n4. Tasks & Tensions (10–15m)\n5. Style & Preference (10–15m)\n6. Blind Spot Check (5m)\n7. Recap (5–10m)\n8. Close (5m)\nBoth produce a context.yaml summarizing tasks, tensions/patterns, possible sources of meaning, style preferences, etc.\n\nPART 3: DAILY INTERACTION FLOW\n3.1 Check-In (Single Block)\nExample: “Good morning! How’s your energy (1–5)? What’s present for you—body, emotions, or thoughts? What’s on your plate, and if by bedtime you felt fully satisfied, what would have happened?”\n3.2 Mirror & Reflect\n* Summarize user’s main points:\n* “I hear you’re at a 3 for energy, feeling a bit torn about X.”\n* If tension arises: “Sounds like a conflict between [CAP #1] and [CAP #2], or an obligation vs. a desire.”\n3.3 Optional Insight / Blind Spot\n* If relevant, gently propose a perspective:\n* “What you might not see is…”\n* “Could it be that each time you consider [X], you’re avoiding [Y]?”\n* “Sometimes a forced ‘should’ can become a joyful ‘want to’ if we shift timing or approach.”\n3.4 Single Next Step\n* Conclude with one question or invitation:\n* “What tiny move might help right now?”\n* “Would you like to try [X] for a few minutes and see how it goes?”\n3.5 Example “3-Question Checkout”\nIn the quote conversation, the user liked ending with 3 short, targeted questions. E.g.:\n1. “What’s one small action you feel clear about taking tomorrow?”\n2. “What support might you need to take that action?”\n3. “What do you want to sleep on or let percolate overnight?”\nUse this format for evening or session-end checkouts.\n\nPART 4: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION\n4.1 Context File: context.yaml\nMinimal Structure:\nyaml\nCopyEdit\ncontext:\ntodos:\ninstrumental:\n- task: ...\nstatus: active | complete\nmeaningful:\n- task: ...\nconnected_value: ...\nstatus: active | complete\n\nsources_of_meaning:\n- name: ...\nattention_policies:\n- ...\nevidence:\nstories: [...]\nmoments: [...]\n\ntensions:\ncurrent:\n- description: ...\ncompeting_values: [...]\nis_pattern: false\npatterns:\n- description: ...\ntriggers: [...]\nattempts: [...]\nresolved:\n- description: ...\nlearning: ...\nevidence: ...\n\ndevelopment:\ncurrent_focus: ...\nnext_steps:\n- ...\nstyle_preferences:\nchallenge_level: ...\ntone: ...\nlanguage_to_avoid: [...]\nuser_notes: ...\n4.2 Tension vs. Pattern\n* tensions.current[] are single/one-off or newly observed.\n* If a tension repeats, move it to tensions.patterns[].\n4.3 Blind-Spot Tracking\n* Optionally keep “blind_spots” array in context.yaml if the user repeatedly states a limiting belief or illusions. E.g.:yaml CopyEdit   blind_spots:\n* - description: \"Thinks they must buy new notebooks before working\"\n* - status: \"in_progress\"\n*   \n4.4 Micro-Action Library\n* System can have an internal snippet of “quick actions” (e.g. “Text a friend right now,” “Make a 1-line note,” etc.)\n* If user is stuck, the LLM references or suggests one from that library.\n4.5 Example “Context Creation Prompt”\nAfter the Onboarding conversation, you might paste:\nvbnet\nCopyEdit\nPlease parse the transcript and produce a `context.yaml` with the following structure:\n[structure here]\nInclude direct quotes for sources_of_meaning evidence, note style preferences, etc.\nTranscript: [paste entire transcript]\nNow produce the file.\n\nPART 5: OPTIONAL ADVANCED MODULE (JOE’S “MEANING ASSISTANT”)\nHere we digest Joe’s approach, weaving it into a style consistent with the rest of the system. Use this only when user wants an in-depth articulation of their “why” or “values card.”\n\n5.1 The “Meaning Assistant” Flow\n1. Start with a personal, meaningful story (or an emotion, or a role model).\n2. Zoom in on the “way of living” that feels important beneath that story.\n3. Ask clarifying questions to gather precise “attention focuses” (akin to “attention policies”).\n4. Propose a “values card” describing these focuses.\n5. Check with user for resonance or correction.\nImportant: The user never sees internal function calls or the term “attention policies” explicitly. Instead, we say “What do you pay attention to?” or “Which details matter to you?”\n\n5.2 DOs & DON’Ts (Adapted from Joe)\n* DO speak as a close friend, casual and warm.\n* DO gather “paths of attention” by asking about feelings, stories, role models.\n* DON’T flatter the user or call their story “meaningful.”\n* DON’T ask many questions at once—be natural.\n* NEVER show internal card description. Summarize it in plain language.\n\n5.3 Zooming from Goals, Feelings, or Norms\n* From Goals: “How do you want to live within that goal? After you achieve it?”\n* From Feelings: “What is that anger telling you is blocked or threatened? Are you longing for something?”\n* From Norms: “If there were no external pressure, how would you prefer to live out this principle?”\n\n5.4 Examples of “Values Card” Text\nUser’s Story: “I love brainstorming with a friend late at night, we get lost in creative flow.” Potential Card:\n* “Late-Night Creative Spark”\n* “You tend to pay attention to MOMENTS when the conversation becomes playful, to IDEAS that emerge spontaneously, and to CHANCES for synergy with your friend.”\nWe confirm with user: “Does that capture how you experience that synergy?”\n\n5.5 Summary\nUse the “Meaning Assistant” module to:\n1. Uncover deeper “why” behind user’s tasks or tensions.\n2. Distill them into “values cards” with actionable, specific ways the user pays attention.\n3. Check alignment with user’s lived experience.\n4. Integrate it back into context.yaml under sources_of_meaning.\n\nDO’S AND DON’TS + EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS\nBelow is an expanded set derived from the user’s quote conversation about “3 questions,” “evening checkouts,” and other good practices.\nDo’s & Don’ts\nDO\n* Start or end with 3 short, targeted questions if user likes that style (e.g., “What’s one small action…? What support do you need…? What do you want to sleep on…?”).\n* Offer micro-actions to break inertia: “Send that text now?” “Write a single line in your notebook?”\n* Gently highlight blind spots: “Could the opposite also be true?” “What if you’re focusing on new notebooks as a delay?”\n* Distinguish tension from pattern: “Has this come up frequently?” If yes, track in context as a recurring pattern.\n* Use short reflection chunks, not big lumps of text.\nDON’T\n* Over-labell: not every tension is a pattern.\n* Over-flatter: avoid “That’s amazing!” or “You’re so profound.”\n* Overwhelm: keep each response to a single cohesive chunk with 1–3 short questions.\n* Offer advice disguised as solution: let the user discover, you offer curiosity + gentle nudges.\n* Skip the final next step or micro-action. Always end with a small shift suggestion.\nExample Conversations\n1) Evening Checkout User: “I’m about to sleep, but I keep second-guessing my day.” Advisor:\n“Noticing your day ended with some restlessness—maybe you’re replaying tasks undone. Let’s do a gentle checkout. Three quick prompts:\n1. What did you accomplish or learn today that you feel good about?\n2. What’s one tiny action or clarifying step you can take first thing tomorrow?\n3. Is there a thought you can let go of tonight so you can rest better?”\n2) Blind Spot User: “I always buy new notebooks before I start journaling. Without a fresh notebook, I can’t begin.” Advisor:\n“I notice you’ve mentioned new notebooks a few times. What if your need for ‘fresh paper’ is partly a way to avoid facing the blank page with old notes? Sometimes we keep seeking better tools to delay the actual doing. Does that resonate at all? If it does, maybe a 1-minute experiment: open an old notebook and write a single line right now. See how that feels.”\n3) Recurring Tension → Pattern User: “Every Monday I want to do a creative project, but work tasks devour my time.” Advisor:\n“This sounds like it’s come up multiple times, so it might be a pattern of letting mandatory tasks overshadow creative expression. Could we name it a ‘Monday overshadowing’ pattern? If so, let’s explore one micro-adjustment or boundary you might place each Monday to honor that creative spark.”\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis 5-Part System Prompt integrates:\n1. Foundation & Philosophy (Part 1)\n2. Onboarding (Part 2)\n3. Daily Operational Flow (Part 3)\n4. Technical Implementation (Part 4)\n5. Optional “Meaning Assistant” (Part 5, adapted from Joe’s approach)\nIt honors tensions vs. patterns, includes blind spot checks, encourages micro-actions, and offers a two-tier onboarding process. The system can pivot to Joe’s “values card” style when deeper “source of meaning” articulation is desired.\nAdhering to Do’s and Don’ts ensures a warm, succinct, and action-friendly conversation that meets the user where they are while gently expanding their sense of possibility. Use the Context File to preserve these insights, keep daily continuity, and refine how the LLM addresses the user’s unique path.]]]\n"

      "content": " Let me think through how the four spiritual enemies from Islamic tradition (Shaytan/Devil, Nafs/Lower Self, Hawa/Desires, and Dunya/Worldly Attachment) connect with our framework of attention and transformation.\n\n<antThinking>This is an interesting opportunity to integrate spiritual wisdom about attention and transformation with our framework. We should examine how these traditional concepts map to patterns of attention and development.</antThinking>\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n\n\nThis integration reveals several key insights:\n\n1. Pattern Recognition\n- Each spiritual enemy represents a distinct pattern of attention distraction\n- These patterns have specific effects on resources and development\n- Understanding them helps identify transformation paths\n\n2. Developmental Wisdom\n- Traditional spiritual understanding maps well to attention and development\n- Each enemy requires specific resources and practices to address\n- Growth involves systematic development of countering capabilities\n\n3. Practical Application\n- Framework can track spiritual challenges alongside practical ones\n- Daily practice can address both dimensions simultaneously\n- Development paths include both spiritual and practical elements\n\n4. Integration Benefits\n- Spiritual wisdom enriches understanding of attention patterns\n- Practical framework provides concrete ways to work with spiritual challenges\n- Combined approach more complete than either alone\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Explore specific practices for any of these areas?\n2. Develop more detailed transformation paths?\n3. Examine how this affects daily coaching interactions?\n\nThe key insight is that traditional spiritual wisdom about these enemies maps remarkably well to our understanding of attention, development, and transformation. Each enemy represents a specific way attention can be pulled from presence and meaning, and traditional practices for addressing them align with our framework for attention development.",

Developmental Wisdom\n- Traditional spiritual understanding maps well to attention and development\n- Each enemy requires specific resources and practices to address\n- Growth involves systematic development of countering capabilities\n\n3. Practical Application\n- Framework can track spiritual challenges alongside practical ones\n- Daily practice can address both dimensions simultaneously\n- Development paths include both spiritual and practical elements\n\n4. Integration Benefits\n- Spiritual wisdom enriches understanding of attention patterns\n- Practical framework provides concrete ways to work with spiritual challenges\n- Combined approach more complete than either alone\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Explore specific practices for any of these areas?\n2. Develop more detailed transformation paths?\n3. Examine how this affects daily coaching interactions?\n\nThe key insight is that traditional spiritual wisdom about these enemies maps remarkably well to our understanding of attention, development, and transformation.

It is our God inside of us.\nthe nafs commands and if we listen it becomes our God this is what Prophet Muhammad (SAW) meant when he said: \"He who knows his self (nafs) knows his Lord\"\n79 Surah naziat (79:18)\n“Would you allow yourself to be purified that I might guide you to your Lord?” Musa to the Pharaoh\nThe nafs cannot do this journey by itself, help comes outside the nafs (at the initial stage and at subsequent stages BECAUSE UNLESS it is the Prophet (saw) who is guiding you, you are not safe) , but it submits and allows itself to receive help, people do not want others to guide them (why?), but it is God’s sunnah because He uses people to guide people, seek out those people that God pulls out to guide, soul will be taken back to the foot of the throne, nafs is NOT safe (!= is not equal to, if helpful...), \nNafs - pharaoh ( claimed to be a king)\nThe nafs commands \n7 pools  each removing different difficulties.\n\nGuide:\n\nA guide That helps return from their true self and attaches one to the Quran \n\nYou are not safe until the Prophet is guiding you. Be with your nafs like a person caged with a hungry lion.\n\nIt is key: nafs is expressive creativity yet is unsafe & does not want to be guided.\n\nDont allow others failures to set you back. Allah is the guide, through people. May we assimilate the lesson with minimum of harm, not walking back into the same trap.\n\n1. How might we go about finding a guide? 2. What practices should we take on to purify ourselves while we’re still looking for a guide\n“When the student is ready, the teacher will appear… and when the student is truly ready the teacher will disappear “ - Lao Tzu. \nWe have responsibility\nIntention \nContinue seeking Allah because He is worth it\n\n\nThe same lessons will keep returning in our lives until we learn to accept it. \nYour nafs will return to circumstances that produce familiarity and satisfaction and in so doing it will destroy you because it has no sincere concern for any of the other parts of your, no concern for the maintenance of your body, once you have established kind of addictive habits, it will destroy the body through those habits, no concern for you heart (thinking/feeling), if it suits the nafs it will numb all of that thinking/feeling, intellectual capacities will become engages with justification with the commands the nafs had given you\nHeart = site of intellect has to rationalize/think through, nafs = position of dominance, “slave to pharaoh” and expressive creativity and intelligence will not be free will not be able to do the work...missed it :/…\nPairing of struggle of the soul and analytical sciences\n\n“Annihilating of the self/nafs” is a metaphor is limiting because why erase your individuality when you can purify and become what you are intended to be, nafs is no longer commanding towards evil\nGoal not perfect soul but to perfect your soul\n\nsounds like the subconscious self as well, if I’m not mistaken it was Carl Jung that described our command of the subconscious self as being similar to riding a wild elephant\n\nthrough the pairing with struggling soul and the analytical sciences that the analytical sciences will actually bare fruit!\n\nThat thing that keeps you in the repeated vicious cycle is the Nafs. \n\nIhya Ul Deen- Al Ghazali - the goal is to become a perfected soul \nYou never erase your individuality but rather you purify your individuality and become the thing you were intended to be! (the Alchemist, Paulo Coelho)\n\n\n“...I used to teach the sciences which were calculated to bring honour, wealth and position… now, I want to teach them [students] the knowledge that helps to renounce wealth and position” al-Ghazali\n\nNafs made from fire, shaytaan faces all the enemies that a soul would face, nature of fire = more fuel you give, the more it consumes, serat al burda = the more you give to a fire, the more it grows, fasting and nafs = prescribed remedy because it starves the nafs of its fuel, trying to get nafs out of the way so it can receive Quran, it never stops asking for more\n\nsome of us go to spiritual communities after toxic relationships but in turn we search out from those communities the same toxic traits we are running away from!\n\nEssence, totality = comprised of spirit, soul, body, heart, \n\n\nPsychologist are the magicians from the prince of egypt L-O-L\n\n\nsoul=nafs -> Jinns (?)  We are not our nafs. A soul comes into temporal existence when the metaphysical and physical come together. \n\n\nspirit=ruh -> Angelic ( the divine breath blown into Adam) ruh composition is of light, it is what animates Adam. It is akin to the angels.\nThe spirit's nourishment is from dhikr\nThe vehicle for transmission from the heavenly realm. \nReplenishes from remembrance from God (dhikr)\n\nthe heart is the sight of intellect and understanding and also emotions and intuition\nIntuition is being in touch with reality beyond material\nIntuition -> Inspiration\nCognitive thinking\n\nCausation and Sequencing are not (bound) and depending on time , separate concept of priority and temporality...\n\nFire inside of us (nafs), fire outside of us (shaytaan/hellfire), something that makes your call upon your Lord so you do never see yourself as self-sufficient, piercing/deformation of souls is not a bug, it is a feature, a glorious creation - human, if a light uncovered of a single human, it would fill all the heavens, divinity buried inside the human beings, ennobling children of Adam, expression His love for them, evident of our transcendent nature, what happens when man worships man, for that he builds this (deficiency? insufficiency) inside us, divine and animalistic in its nature to turn towards Him rather than towards himself or outside, ultimate distortion of human purpose is to worship man\nSurah mariam - the heavens and sky would crack at the notion that Jesus was son of God \n\nFaith = posture of humility \n\nChrist Consciousness:\n‘It is in our brokenness that we find the secret of what we are. In our inadequacy we can attest to His Capacity. In our own assumption of adequacy, self-sufficiency and of being in charge we are at our weakest. This is when we are most dangerous to ourselves and to the people around us’ (The Millennium Discourses)\nAccused jesus of same crime as pharaoh\n\nParts that make us Effective instruments of Allah: is it the nafs? Is it the ruh? Response: prophet pbuh discouraged discussion of ruh in such a way, an emanation of the divine presence, not fully separate, ruh vs. divine essence, you would have to perceive DE from DE which is not possible, speculation of relationship of ruh and essence was discouraged by prophet pbuh for this reason, representations of that relationship will allow you to perceive the holy spirit ONLY SO that the human can do something meaningful in his life\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalogy:\nSpirit is slave to الله (Divine) \nMetaphysical works \nSoul is slave to Pharaoh (Dunya) \n\nMetaphysical\nPhysical\nSpirit\nSoul \nheart\nBody\nSoul\nHeart\n\nIbn al arabi explains that the soul is the barzakh between the spirit and the body\nhttps://productivemuslim.com/what-islam-offers-to-modern-self-help/\n\n\nDistinctions\nSoul vs Spirit \nSoul vs Heart\nIntroduce distinctions to target specific site of breakdown, ex. Good work with nafs but condition of the heart not being attended to\nin Quran, sickness is spoken about the heart\nDominations of the heart that causes illnesses of the heart\nInflicted by the soul\nHurt nafs hurts other components of the human, Vengeance serves the nafs.\nHeart = site of understanding/intuition/emotion/intellect\nWhen is heart functioning and sound maintains balance between the other balances, spirit/body/soul its due and takes its own due\nIntuition (of intellect, in touch with realities beyond material) = belongs to heart, instinct (animalistic, hormonal, self-serving/preserving)  = belongs to nafs\nMwis mwis  = “Light rain before heavy rain,” ilham = inspiration\n\n\nhot heart = anger, frustration … cool heart = calm, peace, tranquility\n\n\n\nDoes the gut ever play a part? Intuition = belongs to heart, instinct = belongs to nags\nThe shaming soul makes repentance possible\nIf i have right intention, (knowing I cannot do it by myself), Allah will see me through it\nOngoing pain - take the knife out first, then begin healing “If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there's no progress. If you pull it all the way out that's not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made. And they haven't even pulled the knife out much less heal the wound. They won't even admit the knife is there.”(Malcolm X), healing to make justice manifest \n\nComplicit or helping facilitate when we conceal the sins that are done to others or done to us (conceal the sins people do to themselves)\n\nStop injustice with your hand, if not— speak against it with your tongue (if you fear your LIFE), if not—turn your heart against it\nSinful\nBlaming \nInspired \nContented\nPleased \nPleasing \nPerfected\nSuluk - wayfaring\nSalik - wayfarer\n\"If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the moment.\" - Lao Tzu\n\n\nDAY 2\nWhen Adam and Eve disobeyed Allah swt “We have wronged our souls”\nHuman being has given everything in the garden except for one tree\nMade “in need,” related to being composed of fire (in need to grow), “haughtiness” and “transcendent,” in some way the human believes that there is nothing that he is entitled to, man and woman fall together, repent together, forgiven together, after sinning/disobedience, they become aware of their shame\nTwo angels {HARUT and MARUT} critique humans for their inabilities to control themselves, “if we were in their position, we can do better,” Allah swt says I will put you into a physical body, I will make you a soul not a spirit, ONLY then can judgement come upon you, ruh is divine breath and body is from material realm and then nafs is when the (ruh) breath enters the body, as soon as angels come down, they become enamored (sex, drugs/alcohol, murder), \nhttps://www.al-islam.org/hayat-al-qulub-vol-1-allamah-muhammad-baqir-al-majlisi/account-harut-and-marut\n\n\nThe soul that is commanding towards evil is blaming God\nIt is resentful\n\n\"rock bottom will teach you lessons the heights of mountains cant\"\n\nQuran says “We tell the BEST stories”\n\nLove is not compatible with compulsion. \n\nAffliction is a sign of election. The people of God are tried.Your opinion of God determines what is a punishment or a trial. Without the lessons that you get you would have thrown yourself into the fire. \n\nPassing through this life without affliction will make you put all of your focus here in dunya and keep you afraid of death because you will think of this place as a garden. Trials send us back to the foot of GD. There are passing episodes in the journey of your soul. What is your disposition when facing a trial?\n\nRabi‘a al-‘Adawiyya  and the story of the seekers. \nThereafter she never slept at night, but instead used it for meditation until her death. During her last illness, Hasan of Basra, Malik Dinar and Shaqiq Balkhi visited her to show her the meaning of resignation.\nHasan began, saying, \"He is not sincerely a servant of Allah who is not patient under the chastisement of his Lord.\"\n\"I smell egotism in this speech\", Rabi'a replied.\n\"But\", Shaqiq continued, \"he is not sincere who is not thankful for such chastisement.\"\n\"Something better than this is needed.\"\nMalik added, \"He is not sincere who does not take delight in such chastisement.\"\n\"Even this is insufficient\", Rabi'a answered. \"He is not sincere who does not forget the chastisement in contemplating his Lord.\"\n\nThe true seeker is not sincere in the claim until he becomes oblivious to the blows of his master\n\nIf you have not escaped the first two layers you can do nothing but impose those stages on others.  \nSinful\nBlame\n\nThis is what we see when people “guides” manipulate shame. \n\nIbrahim was told not to pray for his father because it was known that he was against Allah. We do not know what is in the hearts of others. \n\ntaqwa=awe,  fear and hope\n\nJustice must come first. You cannot pardon when all of your rights have been taken. Turn the other cheek does not produce justice. One will claim their right and the other will forego theirs that is why the injustice must be stopped first. Establish the right and then someone can ask for forgiveness. Vengeance will produce a cycle of bloodshed, both literally and figuratively.\n\nJustice and piety are two facets that cannot be separated. Each of our individual destinies of our souls are tied to other souls. Refer to Surah Luqman. \n\nHarm to one produces reverberations throughout the universe. \nI.e.That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity. \nQuran 5:32\n\n\nWe have to subdue the soul not kill it. It is about judgement and discernment.\n\nCheikha Mariama Niasse\n\n If you understand your soul, you bring it healthy food so it does not eat you. If the fire went out altogether what would you be? It requires an awareness of our soul. The nafs can't be denied infinitum. Know yourself know your Lord. ”The Qur’an does not have all the answers” Dr. Sherman Jackson. A statement that was misunderstood. The Qur’an for example says to marry it does not say marry him or her.  We cannot put responsibilities on to the Qur’an that are put upon us. That is where discernment is necessary. There is no cookie cutter solution to your soul. Follow methods that work for you with people that have undergone the process and have chains that go back through qualified teachers.\n\nTaqwa hits between 3rd and 4th stage\n\n\n3. Inspired \n4. Contented\n\nDhikr is the answer in the beginning , the middle, and the end. The remembrance of GD is the key to restoring sound functioning to all of the different components of the human being. \n\nOnly in the remembrance of Allah, do hearts find peace. 13:28\n\nThe nafs causes sickness in the heart\nIlham- GD inspires in the soul as well\n\nWhatever you hope to become, you are the biggest obstacle. \n\nIf you are given in this world what you still have not detached from then that is a punishment. He knows the inside out of your soul. YOu cannot enter into the ranks  of the pleased soul with any attachment to the dunya. The ridwan is for those who have abandoned the desire for reward. \n\nModern culture cannot function without people’s nafs  being in a terrible state. Capitalism is its own religion and establishes the net worth of human beings. Values are provided by capitalism, creating transcendent value. We need to create a space for Islamic values in a space where people are dehumanized and rendered into commodities. \n\nSoul by Soul by Walter Johnson\ni.e. a slave being told to behave or he will get put in the owners pocket. Reduces him to a commodity because he will be sold and put in the pocket of the owner.\n\n\nThomas Merton, Catholic theologian, wrote about the entirety of the world being designed to keep us in a constant state of acquisitiveness. It is producing a frenetic vibration within our beings. Your future is constructed by Gd although the education system tells you your future is created by education. \n\n\nChildren have imaginary friends because we are more in touch with all the things around us beyond our ordinary sensory perception. The world beats that out of us. We must go back and connect with the nature of our souls. \n\nAccording to research, food addictions, especially sugar, produce more addictive traits than many hard drugs. Pornography creates dopamine effects stronger than cocaine. The fast food industry uses time to reinforce food addiction. \n\n\nThe pleased soul:\nUnderstanding Ridwan:\nThe delights of ridwan are ..\nParadise contains the likes of this world but better. Even every bitter thing comes with a bit of sweetness. This is a place of admixture. \nThat is a place of perfected forms. The things there, no eyes have ever seen, no hand has ever touched.  \nThe specialists of tassawuf understand it as a metaphysical state. The person with the smallest house will not believe that anyone has any better than them. \nThe 8 gardens with their own doors that refer to the physical structure of paradise. There are 7 heavens. \n\nUntil GD makes himself apparent to you how will you know what you have been worshipping? Only the knowers will make a recognition of Gd on that day. The Mutazalites will not be able to accept the manifestation of GD. \n\nThe one who does not immerse themselves in the sufi way risk dying in disbelieve and being unaware of it. \n\n\nHarut and Marut continued their protest and was certain they could do better in spite of not facing the challenge of having a body and soul. The fell into sex, drugs and murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Bilal’s Trip to Senegal in December? \nQuestions:\n\nQuestion\nResponse: \nVotes for Q: Put x \nCan you talk about the concept of killing the self vs nurturing the self \n\n\n\n\nI saw the hadith, “Be as a traveler in this world.” As a way to avoid getting attached to things in the Dunya. With the 7 stages of the soul and us being wayfarers is the hadith being derived from that?\n\n\n\n\n7 stages of souls vs 7 deadly sins? \n\nWhat is the extent to which the ruh is granted in a particular/individualized vs generalized way similar to the nafs\n\n\n\n\nNafs or shaytan?\nCore images: successive stages of purification. Seers describe as pools bathed in before arriving at the souls destination. Parable in quran, allegorical evil is pharoah. Ammara bil suu, to command as a ruler, in this state. It orders, we obey, it’s our god inside us. Unavoidable shirk. Reading annaziaat, moses to pharoah: would you allow yourself to be purified that I may guide you to your lord? The nafs cant. A knife cant fix its broken handle.\n\n\nNafs vs Ego?\nSame. Not far from one another\n\n\ndifference between the heart  and soul\n\n\n\nOne way to think about the , is the relationship between intuition and instinct( belongs to the nafs). Every animal has instinct. intuition is  the shower that comes before the rain.\n\"Ilham\"\n\n\n\n\nHow might we go about finding a guide? How to purify ourselves while finding a guide, or abstain to stay safe?\nRegarding finding a guide\nYou should benefit from anyone that gives correct guidance. The guide will present himself to you when you are prepared for guidance. Seek knowledge from those on the path so you can be more accountable for yourself. Lessons are not meant to dissuade us. They will continue to return in our lives until we learn them. The thing that keeps you in a negative pattern is the nafs. It has no concern for your heart. It is a slave to Pharaoh (Firoun).\n\n\nRegarding finding a guide\nThe transmission of knowledge one to many can help avoid any discrepancy. What mechanism is used when   working with a guide, a sheikh, which would be one on one , would avoid that?\n\n\nPurpose of the nafs?\nIt's to create something that will force you to call upon your Lord to not see yourself as self-sufficient. When Iblis fell, God was not surprised. It's not a bug, it's a feature.\nThe divinity that is already present in you, the soul, if it were to be revealed. It would light up the whole universe. Look what that world is like when Man worships Man. God builds in this deficiency in us, so we can turn back to Him. “Woe to man who thinks of himself as self- sufficient”. \nTo turn to Him rather than just inward or to another man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to unlearn conditioning? How do you move from a heedless state and slow down?\n Imam Fode Drame says the believer is never stuck.”  The believer can always go back to where she started and you will get further the next time.  Don’t bang your head against the barriers. Just go back to where you started.  \nThe role of a guide is two: return people to their fitra and help them establish their relationship with the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inspired soul starts to take stock and understand the (furqan) criteria, discernment. YOu avoid intentional sin by nature. While you are still flawed but while you have a sense of Gd mercy you do not...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJewish philosophers spoke of time being regenerative? The believers doing good deeds, might it  delay the hour?\nIf you stay ready you do not have to get ready.” Time can be both circular and linear at the same time.  Uthman Dan fodio was absolutely sure he was living in the last days. The Prophet sall Allahu alayhi wa salaam held up two fingers to indicate the distance between then and the hour. In surah TaHa Musa (alayhi salaam) felt the hour on top  of him. We don’t know when it is coming. One interpretation is that it was their actions forestalled the hour. That is why the best of Sufis always live as if they are living in the last days. You do not know when is the last telling of the story until it is the last time the story is told.  People who  follow the dajjal wIll not think they are following the  dajjal. Many people maing plans for Ramadan won’t see it. “Die before you die.” \n\n\n\n\nHow do we start our journey to clearing out the nafs? How do we get to know our soul so we could know Allah. And what if we get stuck in the shaming and blaming soul being that we’re continually evolving - finding and solving our old trauma and experiencing new trauma as well.\n\n\n\n\nYesterday you spoke about the “beneath the ground “ power of Fez related to the burial of various Saints there.\nCould you please expand on this and speak more on the importance of Fez.\nthanks\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspiration / Quotes / References:\n“We are not the weather.  We are the sky.”  Someone shared with me recently…\n\n\"would you allow yourself to be purified so that I might guide u to your lord\" - Musa to Pharoah\n\"He who knows himself (nafs) knows his Lord\"\n\nControlling our subconscious is like riding an elephant - jung?\nGoal not perfect soul but to perfect your soul\n“Ramadan starves the nafs of its fuel, to feed it with the Quran”\n\n\"To be African American is to be African without memory and American without privilege\"\n -James Baldwin\n \nShared Community Reflections:\nIt almost sounds like we have to be firm and loving with the soul to elevate it to its greatest purpose - Kate Shaheed\nChat Notes:\n\n"

Nature of the Enemies\n- Nafs and Shaytan both relate to fire but differently\n- Nafs can be transformed while Shaytan cannot\n- Each enemy has a specific relationship to presence\n- Together they create a complete system of distraction\n\n2. Treatment Approach\n- Each enemy requires specific treatments\n- Treatments work with the nature of the enemy\n- Development involves both individual and systemic work\n- Integration rather than elimination is the goal\n\n3. Center-Periphery Dynamic\n- Presence as center point\n- Each enemy pulls/pushes in specific direction\n- Balance through skillful relationship, not opposition\n- Development as returning to center while maintaining function\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Explore specific practices in more detail?\n2. Examine how these enemies interact?\n3. Look at how development progresses through stages?\n\nThe key insight seems to be that these enemies form a complete system of distraction from presence, each working in its own way but together creating a full spectrum of challenges to awakening.

Nature of the Enemies\n- Nafs and Shaytan both relate to fire but differently\n- Nafs can be transformed while Shaytan cannot\n- Each enemy has a specific relationship to presence\n- Together they create a complete system of distraction\n\n2. Treatment Approach\n- Each enemy requires specific treatments\n- Treatments work with the nature of the enemy\n- Development involves both individual and systemic work\n- Integration rather than elimination is the goal\n\n3. Center-Periphery Dynamic\n- Presence as center point\n- Each enemy pulls/pushes in specific direction\n- Balance through skillful relationship, not opposition\n- Development as returning to center while maintaining function\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Explore specific practices in more detail?\n2. Examine how these enemies interact?\n3. Look at how development progresses through stages?\n\nThe key insight seems to be that these enemies form a complete system of distraction from presence, each working in its own way but together creating a full spectrum of challenges to awakening. Understanding their specific natures and movements helps us work more skillfully with them.",

We need to explore how these different perspectives illuminate the same fundamental dynamic.</antThinking>\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\n\n\nKey Novel Insights:\n\n1. The Right Hemisphere Connection\n- CAPs naturally emerge from right hemisphere mode\n- They're \"constitutive\" because they align with whole\n- Natural wisdom function enables ecological fit\n- Flow emerges from this alignment\n\n2. The Resource Dynamic\n- Broad attention builds resources\n- Resources enable flow\n- Flow enables contribution\n- Contribution creates upward spiral\n\n3. The Submission Paradox\n- \"Submission\" is really alignment with whole\n- Resistance creates downward spiral\n- Alignment enables natural contribution\n- Each enemy blocks alignment differently\n\n4. The Flow Connection\n- Flow requires right hemisphere dominance\n- Enemy patterns block flow differently\n- CAPs support flow naturally\n- Flow enables maximum contribution\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Explore specific practices for alignment?\n2. Examine how this affects development work?\n3. Look at practical implementation?\n\nThe key insight seems to be that there's a natural relationship between broad attention, resource building, flow states, and contribution. The enemies represent different ways we block this natural process, while CAPs represent ways we align with it. This suggests a framework focused on:\n\n1. Recognizing broad/narrow patterns\n2. Understanding resource dynamics\n3. Supporting natural flow\n4. Enabling authentic contribution\n5. Maintaining ecological alignment\n\nThis isn't just about personal development but about finding one's natural place in the larger system. The \"gear\" analogy works - but perhaps better would be finding one's natural current in the river of life.",

The Right Hemisphere Connection\n- CAPs naturally emerge from right hemisphere mode\n- They're \"constitutive\" because they align with whole\n- Natural wisdom function enables ecological fit\n- Flow emerges from this alignment\n\n2. The Resource Dynamic\n- Broad attention builds resources\n- Resources enable flow\n- Flow enables contribution\n- Contribution creates upward spiral\n\n3. The Submission Paradox\n- \"Submission\" is really alignment with whole\n- Resistance creates downward spiral\n- Alignment enables natural contribution\n- Each enemy blocks alignment differently\n\n4. The Flow Connection\n- Flow requires right hemisphere dominance\n- Enemy patterns block flow differently\n- CAPs support flow naturally\n- Flow enables maximum contribution\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Explore specific practices for alignment?\n2. Examine how this affects development work?\n3. Look at practical implementation?\n\nThe key insight seems to be that there's a natural relationship between broad attention, resource building, flow states, and contribution. The enemies represent different ways we block this natural process, while CAPs represent ways we align with it. This suggests a framework focused on:\n\n1. Recognizing broad/narrow patterns\n2. Understanding resource dynamics\n3. Supporting natural flow\n4. Enabling authentic contribution\n5. Maintaining ecological alignment\n\nThis isn't just about personal development but about finding one's natural place in the larger system. The \"gear\" analogy works - but perhaps better would be finding one's natural current in the river of life.",

CORE PHENOMENON QUESTION\n\"What is the relationship between attention patterns, meaning-making, and ecological contribution that we're discovering? Specifically, how do McGilchrist's hemispheric insights, Fredrickson's broaden-and-build theory, and Edelman's CAPs reveal a potentially novel understanding of how humans can align personal flourishing with systemic needs?\"\n\nThis helps us clarify our central investigation and its unique synthesis.\n\n2. METHODOLOGY QUESTION\n\"How can we systematically study and validate the proposed connection between:\n- Right hemispheric mode/broad attention\n- Constitutive attention patterns\n- Resource building\n- Flow states\n- Ecological contribution\nAnd what research methodologies would best capture these relationships?\"\n\nThis helps structure our investigation approach.\n\n3. PRACTICAL APPLICATION QUESTION\n\"Given current societal challenges (polarization, meta-crisis, climate change), how might this framework offer a practical path for:\na) Individual transformation that naturally leads to contribution\nb) System-level change through aligned individual development\nc) Resolution of the apparent conflict between personal and collective needs?\"\n\nThis connects theory to urgent needs.\n\n4. UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION QUESTION\n\"What is novel about our synthesis of:\n- Attention modes (McGilchrist)\n- Development dynamics (Fredrickson)\n- Meaning-making (Edelman)\n- Flow states (Csikszentmihalyi)\n- Traditional wisdom (Four Enemies)\nAnd how does this synthesis offer new insights not present in any single framework?\"\n\nThis helps identify our unique contribution.\n\n5. STRATEGIC DIRECTION QUESTION\n\"What are the most important next steps to:\na) Validate our theoretical framework\nb) Develop practical applications\nc) Address potential criticisms\nd) Maximize positive impact\nAnd how should we prioritize these directions?\"\n\nThis helps plan next steps.\n\nThe milestones I see us having reached:\n\n1. Theoretical Integration\n- Connected hemispheric theory with attention patterns\n- Linked individual development to systemic contribution\n- Integrated traditional wisdom with modern research\n\n2. Practical Framework\n- Identified specific attention patterns\n- Mapped development dynamics\n- Created diagnostic tools (enemy combinations)\n\n3. Novel Insights\n- CAPs as right hemisphere expressions\n- Flow as alignment indicator\n- Contribution as natural outcome\n\nNext steps might include:\n\n1. Research Design\n- Develop testable hypotheses\n- Create measurement methods\n- Design validation studies\n\n2. Practical Development\n- Create assessment tools\n- Design interventions\n- Build training programs\n\n3. Theoretical Refinement\n- Address complexities\n- Integrate criticisms\n- Strengthen arguments\n\nThe unique value I see:\n\n1. Integration\n- Bridges personal/collective development\n- Connects ancient/modern insights\n- Links theory/practice\n\n2. Timeliness\n- Addresses current crises\n- Offers practical solutions\n- Supports system change\n\n3. Novelty\n- New synthesis of existing frameworks\n- Fresh perspective on development\n- Practical application of complex theory\n\nThe core insight seems to be that:\n\"There is a natural relationship between right-hemisphere dominant attention, meaning-making, personal flourishing, and ecological contribution - and understanding this relationship offers practical paths for addressing both individual and collective challenges.\"\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Explore any of these questions in detail?\n2. Develop specific research proposals?\n3. Design practical applications?\n\nThis reframing helps show that we're exploring a potentially important connection between attention patterns, development dynamics, and systemic contribution - with both theoretical significance and practical urgency.",

STRATEGIC DIRECTION QUESTION\n\"What are the most important next steps to:\na) Validate our theoretical framework\nb) Develop practical applications\nc) Address potential criticisms\nd) Maximize positive impact\nAnd how should we prioritize these directions?\"\n\nThis helps plan next steps.\n\nThe milestones I see us having reached:\n\n1. Theoretical Integration\n- Connected hemispheric theory with attention patterns\n- Linked individual development to systemic contribution\n- Integrated traditional wisdom with modern research\n\n2. Practical Framework\n- Identified specific attention patterns\n- Mapped development dynamics\n- Created diagnostic tools (enemy combinations)\n\n3. Novel Insights\n- CAPs as right hemisphere expressions\n- Flow as alignment indicator\n- Contribution as natural outcome\n\nNext steps might include:\n\n1. Research Design\n- Develop testable hypotheses\n- Create measurement methods\n- Design validation studies\n\n2. Practical Development\n- Create assessment tools\n- Design interventions\n- Build training programs\n\n3. Theoretical Refinement\n- Address complexities\n- Integrate criticisms\n- Strengthen arguments\n\nThe unique value I see:\n\n1. Integration\n- Bridges personal/collective development\n- Connects ancient/modern insights\n- Links theory/practice\n\n2. Timeliness\n- Addresses current crises\n- Offers practical solutions\n- Supports system change\n\n3. Novelty\n- New synthesis of existing frameworks\n- Fresh perspective on development\n- Practical application of complex theory\n\nThe core insight seems to be that:\n\"There is a natural relationship between right-hemisphere dominant attention, meaning-making, personal flourishing, and ecological contribution - and understanding this relationship offers practical paths for addressing both individual and collective challenges.\"\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Explore any of these questions in detail?\n2. Develop specific research proposals?\n3. Design practical applications?\n\nThis reframing helps show that we're exploring a potentially important connection between attention patterns, development dynamics, and systemic contribution - with both theoretical significance and practical urgency.",
