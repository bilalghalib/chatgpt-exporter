      "content": "Here’s a way you could turn what you have into a warm, nutty autumn-style crumble:  \n\n---\n\n**1. Preheat oven**  \nSet to **180 °C (350 °F)** so it’s ready when you’re done assembling.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Prepare the fruit layer**  \n- In an ovenproof dish, combine your **compote (blueberry + plum)** with the **apple slices**.  \n- Taste — if it’s tart, add 1–3 tbsp sugar or honey to balance.  \n- You can sprinkle a little extra cinnamon or even nutmeg for warmth.  \n- If the compote is very runny, stir in **1–2 tsp flour** or cornstarch so it thickens while baking.\n\n---\n\n**3. Make the crumble topping**  \nIn a bowl, combine:  \n- **~100 g oats** (about 1 heaped cup)  \n- **~75 g chestnut flour** (about ¾ cup — mild and sweet)  \n- **~50 g chopped walnuts** (about ½ cup)  \n- **~75 g butter** (cold, cubed) — use more if you like a richer crumble.  \n- 2–3 tbsp brown sugar (or honey, but honey will make it clump more).  \n- Optional: pinch of salt to bring out the nutty flavor.  \n\nRub the butter into the dry mix with fingertips until it forms coarse, chunky crumbs. You can also pulse in a food processor, but stop before it becomes a paste.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Assemble**  \n- Spread the fruit evenly in the dish.  \n- Scatter the crumble topping over the fruit — don’t press it down; you want it loose so it crisps.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Bake**  \n- Bake **30–40 minutes**, until the topping is golden and the fruit is bubbling up at the edges.  \n- If the top browns too fast, loosely cover with foil for the rest of the bake.\n\n---\n\n**6. Serve**  \nLet it cool for at least 10 minutes so the juices thicken, then serve warm — maybe with crème fraîche, yogurt, or ice cream.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can also give you a **variation that uses the walnuts in a caramel layer** under the crumble for extra crunch and flavor. That would make it a bit more like a plum–apple–blueberry walnut crisp. Would you like me to add that twist?",
