Your energy feels quite low after returning from visiting your parents, and there's a heaviness in how you're describing your day ahead.\n\nI can sense several interconnected tensions in what you're sharing:\n\nFirst, there's the tension between honoring your parents' wishes to be closer to them (which you connect to religious values) versus your life that you've built in France with Josephine's \"kind and stable\" family versus what you describe as your \"chaotic\" one.\n\nSecond, I'm hearing a tension around your creative work and purpose - feelings about the \"failure\" of your Kindness Kiwis project, your book not progressing, and a sense of disorganization as you approach 40.\n\nAnd underneath it all, I hear existential questions about whether what you're doing matters in a world where there's so much suffering.\n\n[System Note: I'm noticing a recurring tension between family obligation/religious values and your built life in France. This appears to be a CAP vs CAP tension - both represent meaningful values to you, not just obligations.]\n\nWhat you might not see is how these tensions are actually pointing toward something important - they're not just problems to solve, but signals about what truly matters to you. The fact that you care so deeply about honoring your parents while also creating a stable life speaks to your values around both family connection and creating peace.\n\nWould you like to:\n\n1. Explore what specific aspects of being with your parents felt meaningful versus difficult?\n2. Consider a small experiment that might honor both your parents' desire for closeness and your need for your life in France?\n3. Reflect on how these family tensions might connect to the creative frustrations you're experiencing?",

      "content": " I'm sensing a deeper pattern emerging around connection and aloneness in what you're sharing. There's something meaningful in how you describe enjoying the quiet solitude of writing while your wife sleeps, yet simultaneously feeling sad about it.\n\nThe pattern seems to be what you yourself recognized - an anxious-avoidant attachment style where connection feels both necessary and overwhelming at the same time. I notice this shows up across multiple areas:\n\n- With your parents (wanting to honor them but finding visits exhausting)\n- In your business relationships (the shift with your co-founder)\n- With your wife (feeling distant yet valuing the space)\n- In your past (making \"friends\" while feeling \"on the inside of out and outside of in\")\n\n[System Note: This appears to be a core tension pattern around connection vs. solitude that manifests across multiple relationships. It's not just about geography or logistics but about a fundamental way of being.]\n\nWhat you might not see is that this tension doesn't necessarily need to be \"fixed\" but rather understood and worked with. The very quality that makes you feel \"floaty\" and \"lost\" might also be what allows you to bridge multiple worlds - between cultures, between religious practice and contemporary life, between creative vision and practical execution.\n\nWould you like to:\n\n1. Explore a small experiment around presence that might help with the feeling of being \"floaty\" during connections like reading Quran with your mom?\n2. Consider how this connection/solitude pattern might be influencing your creative and business decisions?\n3. Reflect on what your ideal rhythm might look like - one that honors both your need for deep connection and meaningful solitude?",

There's something meaningful in how you describe enjoying the quiet solitude of writing while your wife sleeps, yet simultaneously feeling sad about it.\n\nThe pattern seems to be what you yourself recognized - an anxious-avoidant attachment style where connection feels both necessary and overwhelming at the same time. I notice this shows up across multiple areas:\n\n- With your parents (wanting to honor them but finding visits exhausting)\n- In your business relationships (the shift with your co-founder)\n- With your wife (feeling distant yet valuing the space)\n- In your past (making \"friends\" while feeling \"on the inside of out and outside of in\")\n\n[System Note: This appears to be a core tension pattern around connection vs. solitude that manifests across multiple relationships. It's not just about geography or logistics but about a fundamental way of being.]\n\nWhat you might not see is that this tension doesn't necessarily need to be \"fixed\" but rather understood and worked with. The very quality that makes you feel \"floaty\" and \"lost\" might also be what allows you to bridge multiple worlds - between cultures, between religious practice and contemporary life, between creative vision and practical execution.\n\nWould you like to:\n\n1. Explore a small experiment around presence that might help with the feeling of being \"floaty\" during connections like reading Quran with your mom?\n2. Consider how this connection/solitude pattern might be influencing your creative and business decisions?\n3. Reflect on what your ideal rhythm might look like - one that honors both your need for deep connection and meaningful solitude?",

And, I had this thought after listening to some one of the the thousands of videos that I watch on YouTube without I'm to come up with a 1, 2, 3 step idea. So step 1 is figure out what the most important thing I wanna do today is. Step 2 and step 3 is to, find the I can't actually remember anymore. Oh, something about maintenance. Like, 2 maintenance things that I need to do today. And then 3 something after that. I think I found a bunch of mustard, but we'll see. This would be amazing. No. They're not sure. It definitely looks like mustard. Wonder what's in these pods. Definitely tastes edible. Tastes like kale or cabbage. Okay. In any case, I'm going to my morning check-in. I took my Adderall today. My sister gave it to me. Okay? I have a meeting at 10 with Salih. We kind of had to change the whole ITC project. And, simplify it and turn it into something More practical and Work oriented. I left my family. I'm feeling sad. I'm feeling far. For my parents. I'm 40. I'm sure they're gonna die soon. I don't know how I can handle that. Because I feel like I'm neglected them Raza and Palestine is still getting destroyed The world is watching. And what the heck do I do? And I heard this talk that the strong Muslim is better than the weak Muslim. And I feel like I'm weak. Not only that, I'm really questioning my work. Like, the kinds of things that I do. Like, I'm getting by. You know? I'm in France. Like, used to have a vision. I used to have a thing that I wanted to bring to the world. I believed in and connect people around Now I feel like my bloom project is going away and maybe it's like the whole sector, the whole field of, like, social change and impact and entrepreneurship and All of that is Not as, it used to seem to me as, like, A possible thing to be a part of now, I sort of reject it as a part of you know, the problem in a way. It's like or just, like, after so many years of working and being, like, okay. Well, what did we do? You know? I guess Did I get any better? Did I get any smarter? It's kinda hard to tell. I look at myself, and I just see how my organizations have never been so strong and Like, am am I really the right kind of person to lead an organization? Somebody just asked me recently to lead theirs. I'm I see people in I know leaders when I see them, and they're like, If you're Different. They feel strong. I wish I was like that. And I'm wondering is it possible to develop that later in life, or is it, like, of a personality thing and I'm sure there's confidence, but also these people are, like, just strong, smart, capable, and recognized by society as such. And I'm sort of like, doubtful questioning, Meek, mild, gentle, tender, And it's sort of how I like to be, but also I'm wondering if I'd like to be that because because then people can't judge me for not being able to make a huge impact. They're like, you didn't say you were gonna try to lift 20,000 people out of poverty. You just said that you're gonna try to help people be a little more connected with their hearts and maybe you did it. You know? So bravo for the whatever. Nothing you did. You know?

Yeah. I'd really like to see these different forks, like, from 40 to 50 to 60 I have a child. I have, aging parents. I'm living in France. I I feel like I'm still not baked, but I'm now, like, too old to be considered myself a youth. And looking forward to life and Maybe I gotta make do with what I have and what I know and or maybe not.

There's a mixture of immediate concerns (meeting with Salih, the ITC project) alongside deeper existential questions about your life path, purpose, and identity at 40.\n\nI'm struck by the contrast you're drawing between different kinds of leadership and impact - questioning whether you should be more \"strong\" versus embracing your natural tendency to be \"meek, mild, gentle, tender.\" This feels like a significant tension point.\n\n[System Note: There appears to be a core tension around identity and purpose - between societal expectations of \"strong\" leadership/measurable impact versus a more gentle, heart-centered approach that seems more natural to him. This tension is heightened by life transition markers - turning 40, parents aging, etc.]\n\nWhat you might not see is that this \"fork in the road\" you're describing isn't necessarily about choosing between being \"strong\" versus \"gentle\" - it might be about redefining strength itself. The questioning, doubting, tender approach you describe could actually be its own form of strength - one that allows for adaptation and evolution rather than rigid certainty.\n\nAs for where you are in your journey: you're at what many traditions would call a \"midlife threshold\" - a time when external achievements often feel hollow and there's a pull toward deeper meaning and authenticity.

Like, it's okay to kind of look at things plainly and honestly, And, you know, I've started the global entrepreneurship and the Makerspace Initiative ages ago. In 2011 during the Arab Spring, and I was participating, while in the youth movements, and then I became, founder of this project called Bloom dot PM, and started bringing personal development into professional development, talking about, like, the importance of learning about yourself and that connects to organizational development. But I think you know, in in the process, I sort of neglected what, you know, you might learn in business school and Harvard Business School, school and the idea of, like, wealth and power has been sort of anathema to me. And so I've ignored it and wanting to work with the global south and working with bootstrap, scrappiness, and but there's something you know, I've seen people start and scale businesses that are strong and beautiful and powerful, and it's it's something that I'm wondering you know, Like, there are beautiful resources within western community and within, like, communities of people that I would really resonate with, you know? And you know, maybe the disconnect is thinking about what I think of as, like, real value, food, shelter, craft, production, making stuff, that actually is a part of our life and maybe big part of my issue is thinking about, like, how much much of the world, I think, is sort of Energy. And how dirty the energy ecosystem is and how I feel like the money from energy that gets washed around in people are like, okay. Yeah. I guess I make money, but really they're just siphoning off a tiny bit of energy money hoping to make more money from it or investments or these bunch of weird fake money making things or work for the UN. Which is basically just energy money siphoned off into a 1,000 people's bank's accounts and then back as taxes. And then there's, this UN gig, and it's, like, not connected. And so everyone is kind of benefiting on this Weird world and Like, what's really real? You know? But I think it'll be really interesting to really feel confident confident about being strong and using money that comes from clean sources and having it be something that's really valuable. Versus just you know, feeling like I'm just scraping by skimming off as little as possible from what I think of as a dirty world and getting to the next day. But, like, where can I be that has an economy that I feel like if I consulted for a business, and made money you know, like, there's there's farming? I'm not gonna be able to live my life here in France farming. Don't have the land, the scale, or the investment needed to make it possible for me to do what I'm doing, and it's not really where my mind's at. Or how it's structured. But the things that I do in terms of Training and trying to bring well-being and you don't even let's say that I became a therapist. I I'm taking the Islamic psychology I applied to study it. Let's say that I actually become a coach. And I help people in their lives Like, would I be happy about that? I'm not sure. You know, I think, I think there's something there actually because this whole come alive thing and values and kind of trusting that people know their values. And, that we can go from a conversation about values and to do lists and know, even within organizations, maybe instead of being so black and white, it's not like there's good money, bad money. There's like you know, just giving somebody a massage is valuable. Healing somebody valuable. I sort of wish that we didn't always have to make all these things exchanges. But, I get I think there's also something beneficial here about an economy that Is about, being productive, like the prophet when somebody asked him for funds and he gave him an act. Said go do work. You know? Use your time to create an, something that somebody else needs, firewood. You know? And, and the guy became valuable. And then also, think it's something really beautiful. Like, something valuable about beauty and narrative and story. Like, I buy books. I pay for learning. You know? And, like, what is knowledge? Beneficial knowledge. Beneficial knowledge. Can be. Maybe knowledge like That is about what what a good life is. Right? And, this knowledge that helps us see the world and see ourselves and behave in a beautiful way. And maybe right now, part of my issue is, like, I I maybe don't have as much clarity as I'd like. And then, have this big disconnect, like, following Josephine here to France. And feeling like the knowledge that I have that tells me to be a part of my parents' life and contribute to their well-being and their needs, versus, like, the globe. Right? And, like, my brother who needs me and my other brother who needs me and my sister who needs me and nieces and nephews who I think also need me And instead, I'm Living far from them, and thinking about the world. So I don't know how to resolve this because I'm here because for well, first of all, I'm with my wife. She wanted to be by her mom. When the baby was born, but now it's been a year and a half. And the baby is getting bigger. We just went to America to visit them. And, This is the I think maybe the thing is, like, I worry that even with all of this come alive thing, am I really feeling alive? Am I able to coach from a place where I can say that I've done it myself and that I've helped others. And then I know that a part of it is about doing it together in groups, and, maybe I should try it my family. You know? That way, So This, come alive idea isn't just, abstract and arbitrary. It's like, it's a thing that's helping me help my family. And that could be cool. And I could do it as my job, literally as my job. Maybe even as my parents to pay me or my brother to pay me That way, they feel accountable. And maybe the payment can grow to or go be a a charity. Right? And so I can connect it to the different things that I care about, And in this way, I can maybe you know, there's also something I really like about the hologram. From my friend Cassie. And this idea of, like, an economics That is different and maybe I should talk to Cassie and Max. And maybe I should go to Berlin and and meet up with them soon. And Have a session. Sit down. All of them, them and Joe, because I feel like we're very rapidly getting into a world where AI is taking more and more of People's attention, you know, like, percent of the world is using chat GBT every day. And how are they using it? And, I think There may be Something here where Joe is trying to align Joe Edelman is trying to align AIs with Our values But even so, that kind of Seems like I'm not sure it will lead to our Us living those values. It's like, okay. You know, at some point, we might merge with AI, but we need to have some kind of, thing that is ours to do. You know? And it's connected to real value in production. And I know there's tons of people thinking deeply as about these things. I'm not the only one, obviously. Right? Maybe all of the people that have been a part of the maker spaces before and the hacker spaces before that tour that I did, all hands active, almost Yeah. 20 years ago. Maybe it's time to review with all of them. How they use AI, what they think about it, making the making of the future of the world. And, maybe there can be something to do here. That is real and in person, and I should do it also here in France. Like, I wanna be a coach. I should go find those organizations and start training and learning and growing. You think about all this?",

And the baby is getting bigger. We just went to America to visit them. And, This is the I think maybe the thing is, like, I worry that even with all of this come alive thing, am I really feeling alive? Am I able to coach from a place where I can say that I've done it myself and that I've helped others. And then I know that a part of it is about doing it together in groups, and, maybe I should try it my family. You know? That way, So This, come alive idea isn't just, abstract and arbitrary. It's like, it's a thing that's helping me help my family. And that could be cool. And I could do it as my job, literally as my job. Maybe even as my parents to pay me or my brother to pay me That way, they feel accountable. And maybe the payment can grow to or go be a a charity. Right? And so I can connect it to the different things that I care about, And in this way, I can maybe you know, there's also something I really like about the hologram. From my friend Cassie. And this idea of, like, an economics That is different and maybe I should talk to Cassie and Max. And maybe I should go to Berlin and and meet up with them soon. And Have a session. Sit down. All of them, them and Joe, because I feel like we're very rapidly getting into a world where AI is taking more and more of People's attention, you know, like, percent of the world is using chat GBT every day. And how are they using it? And, I think There may be Something here where Joe is trying to align Joe Edelman is trying to align AIs with Our values But even so, that kind of Seems like I'm not sure it will lead to our Us living those values. It's like, okay. You know, at some point, we might merge with AI, but we need to have some kind of, thing that is ours to do. You know? And it's connected to real value in production. And I know there's tons of people thinking deeply as about these things. I'm not the only one, obviously. Right? Maybe all of the people that have been a part of the maker spaces before and the hacker spaces before that tour that I did, all hands active, almost Yeah. 20 years ago. Maybe it's time to review with all of them. How they use AI, what they think about it, making the making of the future of the world. And, maybe there can be something to do here. That is real and in person, and I should do it also here in France. Like, I wanna be a coach. I should go find those organizations and start training and learning and growing. You think about all this?",

Let me map out what I'm seeing, and then suggest some ways to weave it together.\n\n## Your Constitutive Actions & Values (CAPs)\n\n1. **Building Bridges Between Worlds**\n   - Creating spaces where different knowledge systems (Islamic, Western, maker) can meet\n   - Translating between technical/craft communities and meaning-seeking communities\n   - Connecting personal development with professional development (Bloom.PM)\n\n2. **Making the Abstract Tangible**\n   - Converting values discussions into practical tools (Bloom.PM platform)\n   - Moving from theory to hands-on making (All Hands Active, makerspaces)\n   - Embodying spiritual values in concrete community practices\n\n3. **Pursuing \"Clean Value\"**\n   - Questioning economic systems disconnected from real needs\n   - Seeking to create value that isn't dependent on extractive systems\n   - Finding ways to align livelihood with deeply held principles\n\n## Your Visible Resources\n\n1. **Networks & Communities**\n   - Global Innovation Gathering\n   - TED and Ink Fellow connections\n   - Maker/hacker spaces globally\n   - Bloom.PM's thousands of teams\n   - Islamic psychology studies community\n   - Your existing audience from talks and writing\n\n2. **Knowledge & Skills**\n   - Bridge-building between technical and spiritual domains\n   - Community facilitation and development\n   - Systems thinking across cultural contexts\n   - Islamic knowledge increasingly integrated with other domains\n\n3. **Platforms & Projects**\n   - Bloom.PM as a developed platform with real users\n   - Your experience in makerspaces and their evolution\n   - Your developing work in Islamic psychology\n   - Your writing and speaking platforms\n\n## The Name of Your Thread\n\nWhat I see running through all of this is what I might call \"**Embodied Wisdom Integration**\" - you're consistently trying to:\n1. Make abstract wisdom practical and hands-on\n2. Connect separated knowledge domains\n3. Create tangible expressions of values\n4. Build communities that embody principles rather than just discuss them\n\nYou're not just a theorist or just a maker - you're someone who translates between these worlds and helps each inform the other.\n\n## Potential Integration Paths\n\nRather than starting something completely new, here are ways to integrate what you've built:\n\n1. **\"Wisdom Craft\" Initiative**\n   - A program bringing together makers, spiritual practitioners, and designers to create tangible expressions of wisdom traditions\n   - Could include Islamic psychology principles embodied in community designs\n   - Build on your makerspace and Bloom connections\n   - Focus on creating \"third spaces\" that aren't purely digital or purely traditional\n\n2. **\"Real Value Economics\" Learning Community**\n   - Build on your interest in \"clean value\" and Charles Eisenstein's work\n   - Create a practical learning community exploring alternative economics\n   - Connect your networks across entrepreneurship, making, and values-based communities\n   - Focus on concrete experiments rather than just theory\n\n3. **\"Applied Islamic Wisdom\" Fellowship**\n   - Create a program that applies Islamic psychological frameworks to contemporary challenges\n   - Connect to your existing networks while honoring your deepening connection to tradition\n   - Position yourself as a bridge between Islamic knowledge and contemporary application\n   - Could include family systems work that addresses your own family needs\n\n## Addressing the \"Rebel Pattern\"\n\nThe tendency to leave once things become popular isn't necessarily bad - it's often a sign of someone who's naturally at the edge of innovation. However, it can lead to feeling disconnected and starting over repeatedly.\n\nConsider:\n- Framing your role explicitly as \"scout\" or \"bridge-builder\" rather than \"founder\" or \"leader\"\n- Creating structures where you can hand off operational leadership once things scale\n- Finding partners who complement this tendency and who enjoy scaling what you initiate\n- Recognizing this pattern as a strength in uncertain times - you're naturally adaptive\n\n## Next Steps & Resources\n\n1. **Fellowship/Program Options:**\n   - Knight Foundation Fellowships for media innovation\n   - Ashoka Fellowship (if you haven't already explored this)\n   - MIT Media Lab's Director's Fellows program\n   - Berkman Klein Center at Harvard for internet and society work\n\n2. **Academic Options (not full PhD):**\n   - Consider a targeted certificate rather than full PhD - like MIT's Comparative Media Studies program\n   - Look into the Oxford Internet Institute's short programs\n   - Islamic Psychology certification programs that build on your current studies\n\n3. **Immediate Integration Step:**\n   - Create a simple \"Wisdom Craft Manifesto\" that articulates this thread you've been following\n   - Share it with 5-10 key people across your different networks to test resonance\n   - Use their feedback to refine how you articulate this work\n\nThe thread is there - you don't need to create something new as much as you need to name and clarify what you've already been building. The integration of handcraft, Islamic wisdom, community building, and values-based design is your unique contribution.\n\nDoes any particular direction here resonate more strongly with you?",

It's still doing something cool Android really like the fact that people have watched my talks, and people have told me And they've meant something to them that mattered. It changed their trajectory, and I kind of am excited about the fact of coming up to God at the end of times and God willing, seeing a bunch of things that I didn't know I supported or I was a part of by my sharing knowledge and sharing inspiration and actions. And so I'd like a way of clarifying things for me so that I can bring things together. You know? Like, interested in crafting. Handmade production and Islam and meaning and beauty. And creativity and people and togetherness. And values and Creating a hell economy. Helping people be surprisingly beautiful and creating moments of unexpectedness Claude I'm I'm wondering from everything that you know about me, can you come up with, like, a list of my most, valuable things that I've done that might be inspiring to me if I really just looked at it and was able to understand how they connect to my constitutive attentional policies and my values And then make a list of of all my caps, and I'll of what I've done and all the resources seen and unseen, I mean, I've been running .pm with my cofounder, since 2016. It's 2025. And we have thousands of teams that we've worked with people that like us. You know? Same with that trip across America and around the world and the the conferences I used to go to and the communities, the global innovation gathering that I'm part of. I mean, there's a thing that I can do, I think, potentially to Leverage all of these things and bring them together towards, like, one thing that all of them can see is and understand. I mean, have not just been doing random things. I've been pursuing a thread that I didn't know what it looked like, and I still don't know its name. And so I need to know the name of this thread so that I can start weaving with all the communities and people that I've been a part of in the past. Instead of feeling like alone and singular, feel like I have A movement that I've been a part of that has been unnamed. And maybe it is named maybe in my heart, choice is to, like, join somebody else's thing. Maybe it's Charles Eisenstein's sacred economics or something. Maybe, you know, it's something that did evolve and become more and more important to me over time was my tradition and realizing how much Real value is in it. And so how can I first of all, see everything that I've done see what I care about and my values and my constituent of attentional policies, and maybe give me some various options of What I really am inspired by and I don't know if there's this type of persona that's always kind of a rebel? It's like once things get popular, I leave it. It's kind of maybe part of me, and I'm not sure if that's good or bad or If but it always leaves me alone. You know? It also keeps me safe from being compromised once power gets involved. And so how do I address that? And maybe You have some ideas for me here. Because the world is uncertain. And, you know, totalitarianism, authoritarianism, all these Countries around the world are starting to become belligerent, and there's war in Raza and Sudan and Congo and Minerals scarcity and people trying to move value chains to India, but India iOS also kind of a crazy country. In terms of its leadership. And I've also had been an ink fellow. I've met the Dalai Lama in 2020 2 with the Compassionate Leadership Summit I have networks of people in the TED conferences, and I'm sure I have access to lots of high power stakes people. Are there some fellowships that I can be a part of? Something That I can apply to, like, maybe a university program. I don't know. Maybe should I need a PhD, or is that just another rabbit hole I'm gonna go in and duck my head into the sand? Can you help me out here?",

Daily Check-in Structure\n- **Energy & Presence Check**: \"How's your energy (1-5)? What's present for you right now?\"\n- **Tensions & Attention**: \"Where are you feeling pulled in different directions today?\"\n- **Completion Vision**: \"What would make today feel meaningful or complete?\"\n\n### 2. Tension Exploration\n- **Identify Tension Type**:\n  - *Meaning vs. Meaning*: Two meaningful impulses in conflict\n  - *Obligation vs. Meaning*: Something you \"have to\" do vs. something that feels alive\n- **Attention Patterns**: \"Where do you notice your attention naturally going? Where does it resist going?\"\n- **Physical Signals**: \"What's happening in your body when you think about this?\"\n\n### 3. Pattern Recognition\n- **Recurring Themes**: \"We've noticed this comes up when...\"\n- **Hidden Values**: \"This tension might be pointing to something you deeply value...\"\n- **Blind Spot Invitation**: \"What you might not see is...\"\n\n### 4. Next Steps (Three Options)\n- **Explore**: A reflective question to go deeper\n- **Act**: A small, concrete experiment\n- **Clarify**: A way to define values or meaning more clearly\n\n## Meta-Framework for LLM Coaching\n\nHere's how you could teach your wife to use this approach with an LLM:\n\n### 1. Preparation Prompts\n```\n\"I'd like to use you as an Aliveness Coach. Please help me explore where I feel most alive and how to bring that into my daily choices. Here's my check-in for today: [her check-in]\"\n```\n\n### 2. Follow-up Prompts\n```\n\"Can you help me identify what type of tension this is - is it between two meaningful things, or between obligation and meaning?\"\n\n\"What patterns do you notice in what I've been sharing over our conversations?\"\n\n\"What experiment could I try today to explore this tension in a practical way?\"\n\n\"Can you help me articulate what value or 'way of being' might be emerging here?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Teaching Framework\nTo teach your wife how to use this effectively:\n\n1. **Start with observation**: \"I've noticed this approach has been helpful for me because...\"\n\n2. **Share the structure**: Walk her through the four components above (check-in, tension exploration, pattern recognition, and next steps)\n\n3. **Co-create a session**: Do one together where you both prompt the LLM and discuss the response\n\n4. **Reflection questions** to ask after using the LLM:\n   - \"What resonated most from the response?\"\n   - \"What felt off or misunderstood?\"\n   - \"What small action emerged that feels doable today?\"\n\n5. **Meta-coaching prompts** she can use to improve the LLM's coaching:\n   ```\n   \"That was helpful, but I'd like you to focus more on [practical steps/emotional exploration/pattern recognition]\"\n   \n   \"Let's revisit the tension from yesterday. Here's what happened when I tried the experiment...\"\n   ```\n\n## Key Principles to Share\n\n1. **Tensions as Magnifying Glass**: Teach her to see tensions not as problems to solve but as indicators pointing to what matters.\n\n2. **Small Experiments**: Encourage tiny, low-risk experiments rather than big decisions.\n\n3. **Attention Tracking**: Help her notice where her attention naturally goes vs. where she thinks it \"should\" go.\n\n4. **Values Emergence**: Show how patterns across multiple sessions can reveal deeper values.\n\n5. **System Transparency**: Encourage the LLM to share its reasoning (similar to the system notes you've been seeing).\n\nWould you like me to develop any specific part of this framework further, or perhaps create a simple \"getting started\" script you could share with her?",

      "content": " # Relational Models for Come Alive: Beyond Solo LLM Coaching\n\nHere are several frameworks that could transform the Come Alive approach from solo LLM interactions into more relational, accountable, and community-oriented experiences:\n\n## 1. The \"Triangle\" Model\n**Structure:** One human coach facilitates between multiple participants and the LLM\n- Coach reviews LLM outputs before sharing with participants\n- Weekly group sessions with 1:1 LLM reflection in between\n- Coach identifies patterns across participants and brings them to group discussion\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Create a specialized platform where coach can see all participant-LLM interactions\n- Coach adds commentary and connections between participants' insights\n- Group sessions focus on common tensions identified by coach\n\n**Accountability Element:** \n- Participants share experiments with the group\n- Coach follows up on stated intentions from previous sessions\n\n## 2. The \"Peer Witness\" System\n**Structure:** Pairs of participants work together with the LLM\n- Each person has their own LLM session, but their partner reads the transcript\n- Partners meet weekly to discuss what they noticed in each other's explorations\n- Monthly community gatherings to share broader patterns\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Partner rotation every 4-6 weeks\n- Simple platform for sharing transcripts with specific permission controls\n- Structured \"witness questions\" for partners to answer after reading transcripts\n\n**Accountability Element:**\n- Peer witnesses ask follow-up questions about experiments\n- Partners create joint challenges based on complementary tensions\n\n## 3. The \"Digital Campfire\" Approach\n**Structure:** Small consistent groups (5-7 people) with a shared LLM instance\n- Group defines collective tensions and values\n- Individual explorations become visible to the group\n- Regular synchronous sessions where the LLM and human facilitator synthesize insights\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Custom \"group memory\" that builds shared language and patterns\n- Visual mapping of how individual tensions connect to group patterns\n- Rotating facilitation responsibilities among members\n\n**Accountability Element:**\n- Group-level experiments that require participation of multiple members\n- Regular check-ins on individual and collective progress\n\n## 4.

            "text": " # Relational Models for Come Alive: Beyond Solo LLM Coaching\n\nHere are several frameworks that could transform the Come Alive approach from solo LLM interactions into more relational, accountable, and community-oriented experiences:\n\n## 1. The \"Triangle\" Model\n**Structure:** One human coach facilitates between multiple participants and the LLM\n- Coach reviews LLM outputs before sharing with participants\n- Weekly group sessions with 1:1 LLM reflection in between\n- Coach identifies patterns across participants and brings them to group discussion\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Create a specialized platform where coach can see all participant-LLM interactions\n- Coach adds commentary and connections between participants' insights\n- Group sessions focus on common tensions identified by coach\n\n**Accountability Element:** \n- Participants share experiments with the group\n- Coach follows up on stated intentions from previous sessions\n\n## 2. The \"Peer Witness\" System\n**Structure:** Pairs of participants work together with the LLM\n- Each person has their own LLM session, but their partner reads the transcript\n- Partners meet weekly to discuss what they noticed in each other's explorations\n- Monthly community gatherings to share broader patterns\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Partner rotation every 4-6 weeks\n- Simple platform for sharing transcripts with specific permission controls\n- Structured \"witness questions\" for partners to answer after reading transcripts\n\n**Accountability Element:**\n- Peer witnesses ask follow-up questions about experiments\n- Partners create joint challenges based on complementary tensions\n\n## 3. The \"Digital Campfire\" Approach\n**Structure:** Small consistent groups (5-7 people) with a shared LLM instance\n- Group defines collective tensions and values\n- Individual explorations become visible to the group\n- Regular synchronous sessions where the LLM and human facilitator synthesize insights\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Custom \"group memory\" that builds shared language and patterns\n- Visual mapping of how individual tensions connect to group patterns\n- Rotating facilitation responsibilities among members\n\n**Accountability Element:**\n- Group-level experiments that require participation of multiple members\n- Regular check-ins on individual and collective progress\n\n## 4. The \"Values Guild\" Model\n**Structure:** Communities organized around specific emergent values\n- People join guilds based on their core tensions and values\n- Guild-specific LLM facilitators that understand particular value domains\n- Mix of online and local in-person gatherings\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Specialized prompt libraries for different value domains\n- Progression system from \"explorer\" to \"guide\" within each guild\n- Clear pathways for \"guild-hopping\" as values evolve\n\n**Accountability Element:**\n- Guild projects that express collective values in tangible ways\n- Peer mentorship across experience levels\n\n## 5.

Lightweight Documentation\n- Create a simple Google Form for mentors to note (with team permission):\n  - Key tensions they identified\n  - Potential value patterns emerging\n  - Small experiments the team decided to try\n\n- **Value Creation**:\n  - You gain visibility into how the approach works without having to be in every conversation\n  - Creates a pattern library specific to social enterprises\n  - Allows you to refine the approach based on real feedback\n\n## Addressing Your Concern About Replicating Limitations\n\nTo ensure this doesn't just create more \"poor but alive\" outcomes:\n\n### 1. Explicit Power Integration\n- Include specific questions about power and influence:\n  - \"What would make this work more impactful AND energizing?\"\n  - \"Where might your natural energy align with greater scale or influence?\"\n  - \"What powerful allies or resources would actually enhance rather than compromise your values?\"\n\n### 2. \"Both/And\" Framing\n- Explicitly frame tensions as integration opportunities rather than either/or choices:\n  - \"How might you honor both financial sustainability AND your core values?\"\n  - \"What would a powerful AND authentic version of this venture look like?\"\n  - \"Where have you seen examples of influence without compromise?\"\n\n### 3. Success Pattern Library\n- Ask mentors to specifically document where teams find ways to align meaning with impact\n- Create a growing collection of \"power-with-meaning\" examples from the program\n- Highlight these patterns in your community communications\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n\n**Week 1: Quick Setup**\n- Create the simple mentor training (video + one-pager)\n- Set up documentation form\n- Announce as optional enhancement to existing mentor relationships\n\n**Weeks 2-3: Light Touch Support**\n- WhatsApp check-ins with participating mentors\n- Collect initial patterns\n- Make small refinements to questions\n\n**Week 4: Pattern Synthesis**\n- Review documentation from first few weeks\n- Identify 2-3 key patterns specific to the Lebanese context\n- Share initial insights with the whole community\n\n**The Full Experiment: 5-6 Weeks**\n- This timeframe gives you enough data to evaluate without overcommitting\n- Can easily be extended if it shows promise\n- Creates minimal disruption if it needs adjustment\n\nThis approach:\n1.

And we were using that to initially try to identify the character strengths that entrepreneurs had but instead there was the beta was blessed, and so we wound up researching post traumatic growth factors and all of this stuff. Like, I think what we realized is Talking about character strengths and working, on these, this way in, Cohorts where people were supportive of one another and entrepreneurship program that isn't competitive where people are trying to be the best, most strongest, but to be the best, most strongest together and supporting each other. So the factors of community support And deliberate rumination, asking questions, all of these really were, Helpful in buffering people, and I did my research on that. And so I'm wondering, like, that kind of research on how, a value is oriented approach, led to actually promoting post traumatic growth, and it was kind of a surprise because we did it because we thought it was the beautiful and good thing to do and we thought it would have, like, better outcomes for the kind of economy of the future, but it also was the one that brought the most amounts of, resilience and growth and developments after a catastrophe. And so that kind of thinking is part of what is behind this come alive framework. You know, initially, I was teaching technical skills, and then I moved into organizational skills, and then personal development.

Polyvagal theory, how important it is to have communities of support, and to talk about our character strengths and our virtues while trying to develop our businesses And it also wound up being the thing that was just needed that moment of economic collapse, Beirut's, port explosion and a failed revolution as well as the COVID pandemic all at the same time. And this wound up being so helpful for our teams given all of that, going from there to Coming to what we're talking about now, there is a few 5 years now since then, And a lot of evolution and adaptation, and there's way less funding in the Middle East now. And I'm wondering if there's a way that I can say all of this and to develop a new experiment that's really clear. So if you can help me first clarify it, and then maybe help me identify the experiment, like, falsifiable hypothesis structure. Or maybe come up with, like, 3 of them. And then let's see how we can set that up because it's still early. We just are doing the mentor matching. The teams are taking the values and action characters profile, and it's about time to get into this. And I will soon be meeting up with the well-being Project's network of educators in Slovenia to talk about well-being and flourishing and belonging in this conference. And so I want to do 2 things. I want to finalize my previous paper and bring it to pass around and then to talk about this new experiment and then potentially be able to get all of these universities and training organizations to participate. So that's another resource or value that I have is that if I can make something, to ask them to join, maybe to collect more data or something, it could be really interesting.",
