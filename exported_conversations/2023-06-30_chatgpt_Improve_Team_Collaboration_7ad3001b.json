      "content": "assess this document for human factors, HR faux pas and crtique the overall plan and give me an action plan to improve it:\nTeam Bloom! 🌻 🥳\nTHE PURPOSE & PRINCIPLES \nWe need to improve our energy, effectiveness, focus, and collaboration as a team\nWe need everyone to bring their “coaching and facilitating” spirit to the team … helping us all improve our effectiveness and grow together \nWe need to improve how we use our own tools and methods \nWe will be able to achieve substantially more together, if we substantially improve how we work together. \nWe want to empower everyone to be part of this effort, and part of the decision-making on who is helping us all grow together. \n\n\"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.\"  \n– Michael Jordan\n\n\nTHE SUGGESTIONS\nDaily check-ins are expected for the percentage of time you work at Bloom. \nIf you’re working 5 days/week, then you should join the check-ins 5 days/week. \nHowever, WHAT we do during them is up to you, to us all, to decide. Let’s decide together what we do during the team check-ins. We want this time to be really helpful time for us all, to experiment with ways to make this more meaningful, and for each of you to take leadership on regular check-ins and activities. As a remote team, this 30 minutes per day connected together is very important, and largely makes up for coffee-break chats, shared lunches, and other encounters that make being in an office really valuable. \nAs a bonus, feel free to eat 🥗 or have coffee/tea ☕ during this call, but you should be fully focused with camera on/etc, so not driving/cooking/preparing things during this time. \n\nApproach: \nBasic check-ins shift to being on the Bloom taskboard. Weekly powermoves (set on Mondays & reviewed on Fridays) and daily powermoves should be shared on the taskboard and reviewed on the call through the filtered views. We just use the “WIGs” section on the spreadsheet to update and check in on that weekly (for the Lag measures). \nFriday includes everyone sharing a reflection on a Bloom Value they leveraged or appreciated that week  \nPeople should update their Bloom taskboard daily with the main things they will work on (and/or did work on) that day. \nIdeas to make this part of the check-in more effective are also welcomed! Please share here.  \n\nOther check-in + team activities can include: \nInternal collective intelligence sessions, with discussion items prepared/shared in advance \n1-on-1 breakouts to help people understand more about what others are working on, recent activities/challenges/etc, then brief summaries shared as a group\nReflection and peer coaching discussions about work-related growth \nTime not seated, learning wellbeing habits such as stretching, meditation, etc  \nSomehow a “serious game”? Something fun that we learn from? \nHave people practice / develop key universal skills  \nIdeas to make this part of the check-in more effective are also welcomed! Please share here. \n\nONGOING LEARNING \nWe want to keep learning, adapting, and growing together … so we’ll invite everyone to do a quick 2-question feedback form each day on the facilitation + content, with results in a shared table so we can keep learning from that. Only 2 questions: \nHow effective was this session for you? Score 1-5. \nWhat would you suggest to improve it? Either the content, or facilitation, etc. \n\n\"You need to be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins.\" \n– Jim Stovall\n\n\nTogether Time on Zoom \nYou should spend roughly ⅓ of your work time in BloomHQ on zoom \nShall we set some standard “coworking time” for part of that? And people can do that other time as well? \nPlay music \nWork together \nTake breaks together \nAsk quick questions to unblock each other \nRun pomodoro work sprints together, etc. \nBe present with each other \n\nSHARED DECISION-MAKING, SHARED SUCCESS \nWe want to help everyone be a part of our shared success, and help each other, and be a part of the decision-making for shared rewards, so we’re going to start a Weekly Shout-Outs Form where we invite people to share max 3 “shout-outs” privately per week for who went above and beyond to really support each other and the team, who’s working to help with team energy, help us grow, etc. \nThe results will be kept private and anonymous (only shared with DMN+BG), with anecdotes pulled out monthly or quarterly … \n\nAll of those items above will be included in the reflections above when it comes to discussion promotions, bonuses, and profit-sharing when we get to that … and we firmly believe that the better we all do on those items above, the sooner we will be able to get to the point of having profit-sharing, improving benefits for everyone, etc. \n\n\"The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.\" \n–  Phil Jackson\n\n\"The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don’t play together, the club won’t be worth a dime.\" \n–  Babe Ruth\n\n\n",

      "content": "The document outlines a well-intentioned plan to improve team cohesion, collaboration, and productivity. However, there are some human factors, HR considerations, and areas that require improvement.\n\n1. **Positive Aspects**:\n    - Encourages collaboration and teamwork.\n    - Focuses on continuous learning and feedback.\n    - Incorporates team bonding activities.\n    - Encourages shared decision-making.\n    - Emphasizes the importance of communication, especially for remote teams.\n\n2. **Human Factors**:\n    - **Virtual Fatigue**: Requiring one-third of the work time to be spent on Zoom could lead to virtual meeting fatigue. Continuous virtual interactions can be draining and affect productivity.\n    - **Work-Life Balance**: Daily check-ins might be too frequent for some employees and can intrude into personal time or create a feeling of constant surveillance.\n    - **Diverse Workstyles**: The plan assumes that everyone works well in a collaborative environment. Some individuals might prefer more autonomous working styles and find the level of collaboration intrusive.\n\n3. **HR Considerations**:\n    - **Privacy Concerns**: The Weekly Shout-Outs Form, though anonymous, could be seen as invasive or create a competitive atmosphere that might not be conducive to collaboration.\n    - **Equity and Inclusion**: The document doesn’t address diversity, equity, or inclusion, which are critical in modern work environments.\n\n4. **Areas of Improvement**:\n    - **Clarity and Objectives**: The document could benefit from clearer objectives and performance metrics. It’s not clear how the success of this initiative will be measured.\n    - **Flexibility**: The plan could offer more flexibility in how often and in what manner team members are expected to communicate and collaborate.\n    - **Training**: The document mentions a focus on ongoing learning but doesn’t provide specifics about training or development opportunities.\n\n5. **Action Plan for Improvement**:\n    - **Customize Check-ins**: Allow employees to choose the frequency and type of check-ins that work best for them. Not everyone may benefit from daily check-ins.\n    - **Set Clear Objectives and Metrics**: Define what success looks like for this initiative, and how it will be measured. Provide regular updates on progress towards these goals.\n    - **Address Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**: Incorporate policies and practices that ensure a diverse and inclusive work environment.\n    - **Provide Training and Development**: Identify areas where employees need or want further training and provide opportunities for skill development.\n    - **Feedback Mechanism**: Develop a more comprehensive feedback mechanism that allows for anonymity and ensures that feedback is used constructively.\n    - **Monitor Virtual Fatigue**: Be mindful of the amount of time spent in virtual meetings and ensure there are ample breaks.\n    - **Promote Work-Life Balance**: Encourage employees to take time off and respect boundaries between work and personal life.\n    \nThis plan aims to promote collaboration and continuous improvement, which are commendable goals. However, it is essential to consider the diverse needs and preferences of the team members. Implementing the above action plan would make the initiative more inclusive, effective, and considerate of human factors and HR best practices.",
