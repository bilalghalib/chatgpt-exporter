      "content": "There are several verses in the Quran that mention fasting and travel. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. \"O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous — [Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of days [are to be made up]. And upon those who are able [to fast, but with hardship] - a ransom [as substitute] of feeding a poor person [each day]. And whoever volunteers excess - it is better for him. But to fast is best for you, if you only knew.\" (Quran 2:183-184)\n\nIn this verse, Allah (SWT) commands believers to fast for a certain number of days in the month of Ramadan, but exempts those who are ill or traveling from the obligation. They can make up the missed days later when they are able.\n\n2. \"And if you are traveling and cannot find a scribe, then let there be taken into your possession a security. And if you trust one another, let him who is entrusted fulfill his trust and let him fear Allah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony, for whoever conceals it - his heart is indeed sinful, and Allah is Knowing of what you do.\" (Quran 2:283)\n\nThis verse addresses the issue of bearing witness while traveling. It advises the traveler to take a security (i.e., a valuable item) as collateral for the testimony, and to be truthful and trustworthy even while away from home.\n\n3. \"The month of Ramadan [is that] in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful.\" (Quran 2:185)\n\nThis verse reiterates the commandment to fast during the month of Ramadan, but also provides an exemption for those who are ill or traveling. It emphasizes that Allah (SWT) intends to make things easy for His believers and wants them to complete the prescribed period of fasting.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the Quranic verses that touch upon the topic of fasting and travel. There are many more verses that deal with this issue and provide guidance for Muslims who are on the move.",

The purpose of fasting is to attain righteousness and strengthen one's faith. The verse goes on to explain the specific requirements and exemptions related to fasting, such as making up missed days, providing food to the needy, and exempting those who are ill or traveling.",
