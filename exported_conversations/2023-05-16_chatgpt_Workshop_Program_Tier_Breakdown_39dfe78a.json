Using cutting-edge tools, positive reinforcement strategies, and strengths-based development, we have grown our company to 4 continents and 12 hours of time difference while remaining on the leading edge of business acceleration programs in the MENA region. \nWith this program, you can expect the following:\nIncreased Employee Engagement: The tailored activities and personalized growth plans will help ignite each employee's passion and motivation to contribute meaningfully to the organization.\nHealthier Remote Work Culture: Our program focuses on creating a supportive remote work environment, addressing remote employees' challenges, and promoting a sense of belonging and connectedness with the team.\nEnhanced Organizational Performance: With improved engagement levels, your employees will be better equipped to collaborate, innovate, and drive growth, leading to positive impacts on Wise Systems' performance.\nAssessing Impact \nTo evaluate the impact of our pilot program on remote work engagement and effectiveness, we propose working with Wise Systems to assess the following KPIs to monitor progress and ensure our solution aligns with your organization's goals:\nRemote work capacity: Assessed across the organization.\nEmployee engagement: Assessed by team members\nProductivity: Assessed during the program we will monitor/report team member accomplishments, streaks, and post-program monitoring of selected KPIs.\n“Disengaged employees cost the world $7.8 trillion a year in lost productivity.”\n-State of the Global Workplace: 2022 Report \nProgram Overview\nBloom PM's pilot program aims to catalyze positive change in your remote work culture and improve overall team health, productivity, and performance. Our program will be tailored to suit the unique needs of Wise Systems, and we have a few options for engaging with our training ranging from light touch to training one of your team members - such as an HR representative or team lead - on our methodology so that it may become a repeatable process ingrained in your organizational culture. In addition, they will receive weekly coaching to successfully implement our combined personal and professional growth method within your organization.\nThe Bloom Method\nOur methodology  helps people and teams identify their shared purpose and build towards enhanced shared success. We use reflective practices, personal and professional development assessments, and a library of activities designed to help your employees thrive at work holistically. \nWe focus on fostering self-awareness and identification of purpose at work, effective communication, collaboration, resilience, and personal growth – all critical skills for modern hybrid word environments. These tools, including recent integrations with AI,  will allow your trained team member to facilitate and support your employees' ongoing growth and development.\nThree key principles of a successful Bloom program are:\nOur values and strengths power our performance: We help participants identify their sources of meaning at work that unlocks energy and capacity for committed learning and development in their “missions.”\nAction-based learning loops: Participants are guided to design a “mission” every two weeks. A mission is a performance objective they want to achieve each cycle, including reflecting on past learnings and planning next best steps.\nLearning by doing together: Promote collaboration and mutual support, especially online, since usually two heads are better than one.\n“[Taking the assessments] did open up my eyes to a lot of things. For example, although I knew I had these problems when I wrote them down and shared them with the team and heard their feedback, I completely understood that those are things I should be taking seriously and solving ASAP.”\t\n- Le Joyau d’Olive (Accelerator Participant 2021)\n\nImprove it with your best guess on how to best enhance team engagement and update the timelines you just gave me",
