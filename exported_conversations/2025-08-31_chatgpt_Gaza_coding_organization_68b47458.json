      "content": "Ah, got it — you’re probably thinking of **FikraHub / Gaza Gateway** or the **freelancing side of Gaza Sky Geeks (Skylancer Academy)**.  \n\nHere’s the distinction:  \n\n---\n\n### 1. **Gaza Sky Geeks – Freelance Academy (Skylancer)**\n- Beyond coding bootcamps, GSG set up a **remote work training and matchmaking platform**.  \n- They mentor participants to build Upwork/Fiverr-style freelancing profiles, and sometimes connect them with direct clients.  \n- In practice, it functions like a **“virtual Upwork” incubator** for Gazans — guiding them through getting gigs, building portfolios, and accessing global markets despite Gaza’s restrictions.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Gaza Gateway**\n- A **social enterprise founded in 2015** (by UNRWA initially) to act as an **outsourcing company**.  \n- Instead of training individuals to use global platforms, **companies abroad contract Gaza Gateway**, and then the work is distributed to trained Gazan youth (coders, designers, data entry, etc.).  \n- It’s structured more like an **agency / virtual outsourcing hub** than a bootcamp.  \n\n---\n\n✅ If you remember the “Upwork-like” angle, it’s most likely **Gaza Gateway**.  \n✅ If you meant an organization that helps Gazans **use Upwork and similar platforms**, that’s **Gaza Sky Geeks’ Skylancer program**.  \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to map out how these two differ in **business model, client flow, and worker experience** (almost like a mini-case study comparison)?",
