      "content": "I want to incorporate ideas from samir mahmoud into my sustainability training\nHere is a transcript of a talk of his:\n[Music] i do apologize for the delay in um in the presentation and starting the presentation there are a few technical details and i am a little bit ill so i do apologize for that inshallah without further ado we're going to start and see presentation i have a number of slides i want to share inshallah as usual the title of the talk is architecture and the luminous ground um i chose the topic because i think it's one of the greatest gifts we can do and give to the world and give to ourselves is to recover these spiritual foundations of every aspect of our lives including uh the built environment and the spaces that we live in and the spaces that we we build around us it may not be intuitively uh and immediately obvious to too many to choose a topic like architecture you know a holy month like ramadan but hopefully inshallah by the end of this presentation or at least by the end of the four presentations inshallah uh i will have you convinced that it is extremely extremely important so let's uh start i'd like you to start first by considering a number of experiences you may have had it may be standing on a beach ankle deep in water waves gently laughing against your feet the sun setting behind a crimson horizon we're looking up at the immense blazing stars the sight of a mountain engulfed in mist or a rock overgrown with moss in each and every one of these experiences we have in nature there is a remarkable experience that we have a quality that we perceive but we can't really always articulate what is it that eludes conceptualization but is somehow tangibly intangible or intangibly tangible at the same time it is basically life life not in the crude sense of uh life in terms of my my own life or my career life but life in its most pristine and fundamental form in the language of philosophy philosophers tend to refer to it as as being or existence in its very raw and naked form it's utterly simple it's truthful it's beautiful and it's glorious in some religious traditions they call it the tao it's the principle that flows through all things in some traditions in islam it is referred to as the breath of the compassionate one that breath that god out of his sheer generosity grants to all living things or to all things in existence everything by virtue of existing exists because of divine compassion in the form of a breath that god uh breathes out as it were metaphorically speaking and breathes into all existing things so once they existed in darkness or they had no existence they abided in darkness and then they were given light they were given existence and this is the breath of the compassion it is one yet many it is manifest yet hidden or hidden yet very manifest at the same time it's something that we see something that we perceive it's something that we know is there everywhere around us but somehow we lose our grasp we feel it we know it we encounter it but often we flee away from it with our overly abstract concepts and ideas it's tangible yet intangible it's tangible in the sense that we feel it we know it we see it everywhere in the in a waterfall in a tree in a plant uh in a river in a mountain yet at the same time we know that that's not all there is to it that somehow there is an access to this life that we feel around us that is beyond our immediate grasp and hence it is uh intangible in that sense and this notion of life is a very very interesting very profound one at least in the islamic tradition our contemporary cosmology would suggest to us that life is restricted to animals or human beings or somehow uh even extended to the the life of animals and plants sorry um but increasingly with our new physics increasingly with our new awareness of the complexity of life and and the world around us we increasingly uh in our contemporary thought increasingly recovering an ancient idea that life extends beyond just the narrow definition that we give to animal life or human life life is something a quality that is possessed by all things by the virtue of existing and of course in the islamic tradition in islamic cosmology and islamic theological understandings of the divine names we know that everything is alive simply because we know that the living one is one of the most supreme divine names it's one it's the top of the hierarchy of the um in islamic cosmology um are the divine names that grant existence or the divine names that god bestows upon or through which god creates and therefore bestows these same attributes upon creative things life is the most general the most all-encompassing of the divine names that you see before you on the screen because everything before it possesses knowledge before it possesses speech before its possession possesses a will or power hearing or seeing requires this fundamental quality called life everything in the heavens and on the earth glorifies god we know this through the quran we also know through the example of the sunnah of the prophet muhammad that the pebbles uh performed the sphere of allah in his hands that mountains shook beneath his feet that camels and plants performed their prayers they could speak and so everything is very much alive in fact everything that issues forth from is alive whether it's stone whether it's tree whether it's a mountain or whether it's a plant so in the islamic tradition islamic understanding of things everything from the smallest thing in creation to the largest galaxies and super galaxies everything is very much alive everything falls under the all-encompassing divine name life is the most pervasive quality that permeates all things and so in many ways then we can say that a pebble possesses a degree of life a tree possesses the greens of life mountain possesses the degrees of life and so the plants each in different degrees and one might say that what distinguishes the human being is the degree or intensity of life that we possess uh more than any other of the other creatures and so everything is alive the name the living one is an essential name of god nothing can emerge from him but living things hence all of the cosmos is alive for indeed the non-existence of life or the existence in the cosmos of an existent thing that is not alive has no divine support whereas every contingent thing must have a support and so what you consider to be inanimate is in fact uh alive we didn't need the recent physics to tell us to tell us that stones uh have a certain degree of life the quran has already told us this the quran has already told us that the minerals are very much alive and so life or the existence or the cosmos really consists of a cascade of living beings who issue forth from allah and who are constantly and perpetually returning to allah everything is very much alive in that sense and so we can say that then that life is an objective quality of things in the world when we look at a stone for example we cannot say the stone is inanimate the stone is not alive what we can say and should say is a stone is very much alive with a certain degree of life um and this degree of life is something objective something we observe if we separate if we isolate for uh for an exercise purpose our contemporary cosmology and our contemporary understanding of things and if we just really truly focus on uh a wave breaking on ashore or that stone that parts of the flowing waters in a stream or a branch of a tree swaying in the wind a meadow of flowers or even this rock in the in this meadow here before you in this picture if we really focus uh and connect with our heart we can see that each one of these is pulsating with a certain degree of life and the measure of life is not necessarily known or recognized by the degree of movement it may be easier to see life in a flowing stream or in the movements of a branch in the in the wind but if we are honest with ourselves and we look carefully even this large boulder or this stone in the picture seems very much alive it somehow enlivens us in the process and so life itself is an objective quality in things in the world that we perceive on a regular basis and where there is life there is beauty there is indeed a primordial recognition of an objective beauty that lies deep within all things as opposed to a subjective beauty into contemporary culture we're constantly told that beauty is in the eye of the beholder this is a very false understanding of the statement itself but it does say one thing that is true and that is there's a certain kind of beauty that is subjective it is time-bound it is relative to social cultural and personal taste some people may prefer certain colors some people may prefer certain kinds of dress some people may have preferences for particular types of food at a collective level certain cultures may have preferences for certain types of colors or certain kind of designs and these are all well they're socially culturally bound definitions of what is beautiful but this is not the only type of beauty that exists there is also an objective type of beauty and that is the beauty that is eternal and universal it's the kind that we find in nature it's the kind that heals us and completes us because it flows directly from the fount of life and causes through all things it's not a matter of culture it's not a matter of nation or individual subjectivity to decide on them it elicits the same deep movement of the soul and triggers the same train of meditation in every human being though it is objective it is nonetheless experienced subjectively and differently according to each individual and one of the most amazing things about most pre-modern cultures in fact all pre-modern cultures is that they privileged objective beauty they privileged objective beauty because it was beauty designed um by the paradigm of uh the divine scheme of things objective beauty of nature cannot be surpassed it's perfect because it was designed created ordered and patented according to a divine paradigm and so it is this type of beauty that people aspire to and so when pre-modern cultures decided to develop frameworks and parameters and conditions and criteria for producing things in the world like architecture like towns like cities or even like pots and pans and chairs they decided that the only type of standards of beauty worth emulating were those found in nature because it is the standard of perfection because it is divine creation it's only our contemporary cultures since the 19th and 20th century that seems to have shifted its attention away from the objective beauty of nature in order to focus on the laws parameters and criteria of subjective beauty the problem with subjective beauty is some people may like it some people may not if it doesn't have an objective standard like the parameters and conditions and characteristics of beauty of nature he won't receive universal uh approval and subjective beauty one of the major problems with it is it is too immersed in one's individual whims and the desires of the ego and its incidental preferences and so if i if my premises and my tastes happen to overlap with that of a particular individual i may like the kind of art they produce and the kind of architecture they produce but if it does not overlap with it i'm certainly not going to find it beautiful the chaos of our modern cities the chaos of our modern art is that rather than take the objective standards of beauty founded nature as the ideal to emulate it has taken the subjective whims of the ego as the ideals uh to emulate and uh later in charlotte in the next few talks we're gonna have occasion to talk about this and come back to this topic again and again but this objective beauty in nature is something that we all understand it's a universal truth many of us find ourselves wandering into these pathways in nature escaping the anxiety and alienation that our modern cities bring us and the lifestyle that it brings to us in the bosom of nature we escape from our worries from our woes and find refuge in god's creation we find refuge in the patent beauty and ordered behavior of the natural world in all cultures and civilizations throughout human history nature has always been considered sacred uh holy and beautiful you won't find a single person who will tell you that the beauty of nature um is contested and you won't find a single person who will dispute the healing power of nature herself unless someone of course who has been traumatized uh by something uh in the natural world um so for example uh someone who has experienced some trauma in the forest may not like to visit forest after that because of a personal trauma but that personal trauma is incidental the feather beneath that trauma is naturally inclined to love the beauty of nature so individual traumas don't um this disprove the point but rather they prove the point in itself unless you find someone who has been psychologically disturbed by an actual phenomenon the natural human situation natural human condition is always to find comfort in the natural world therefore objective beauty is an undeniable truth rooted in our fiddler rooted in our universal nature there are therefore universal constant immutable patterns of being or sunnah to life at hulk there are patterns of order in the natural world and in creation there are ways of being there are ways in which things are interconnected which is the quran refers to as sun of the wife and hulk that are universally acceptable that are universally desirable that are universally pursued and sought out out for their comfort and for their intrinsic peace and harmony that they bring us in the natural world in life as it courses through the natural things that allah has created in the world we find life in its most pristine form it is upon the original whereas human beings may corrupt their own fithra whereas we may produce cities that are ugly the natural order is always pristine natural order is always upon the fitrah or the pattern behavior and disposition that god has created for it at once whole and holy nature nourishes it enlivens it heals in our age of alienation of course we turn to nature to find ourselves to restore our fithra there's something remarkable that happens to us which i'll be talking about a lot more in the next few weeks when we come into contact with allah's sunnah whenever we encounter something that allah has created whenever we encounter something that is upon its own fifa its own nature like the natural world even if we are not upon our own nature even if we are somehow misaligned or imbalanced the mere encounter with a fetheric reality like nature immediately reconfigures us and realigns us and restores that balance though temporarily so when we go through that forest walk we walk on a beach what happened temporarily one of the most profound reasons why we find such comfort in places like this is that at a very unconscious level deep within our very being things are shifting and morphing changing and transforming realigning themselves with the pattern of behavior of the waves the pattern of behavior of the trees in the forest yet when we come back to our cities and towns what tends to happen is that temporary realignment and balance that happened in our nature walk or on that beach is disturbed once again because of the unnatural rhythms and patterns of behavior of our everyday life to be an ear anything with life is to be whole in the presence of life the mind is still there are no thoughts just one's entire being face to face with all that is it occurs most deeply when things simply are when we experience that which is when we feel where we are immersed in the current moment as opposed to preoccupied with things that we performed in the past or worrying about things that have yet to come in the future the muslim is someone who is even worked the son and daughter of the present moment why because in the present moment we are able to be present to the divine presence and ultimately that is the goal of our entire existence is to be perpetually connected to the fundamental reality of what is and that is allah god the ground of all being the one who has granted to all creatures and to all creation its form its life its sustenance and in this river of life in the presence of in the presence of the divine presence in the present moment duality is overcome if in our everyday consciousness what we might call ruffler or forgetfulness there is a subject standing over and against an object out there in the world an eye and an it in the internal consciousness of remembrance or wicked in the present moment of being present to allah wholeness is unveiled or revealed to us or the fundamental reality that all is one there is neither i nor it for both have evaporated as the phantoms that they really are what is left is the reality al-haq what remains when all that is illusory fades away is nothing but the face of god everything is or will be annihilated except the face of allah but ultimately only the face of allah is real everything else is contingent everything else is illusory everything else is dependent on the reality of god this is the luminous ground we encounter in nature many people deny it many people try to not call it god call it something else but in reality as muslims we know that this is nothing but the same face of allah the reality of allah who sustains all of creation and all things i've chosen to describe it as the luminous ground for a very particular reason a reason that will become clearer and clearer throughout these presentations in sha allah but one of the fundamental reasons why i want to call it luminous ground is because the term luminous refers to light it refers to the light of the heavens and the earth is a light that grants to all things existence is the light that grants them existence and knowledge and bestows upon them the gift of uh being and the gift of remembering him however when we tend to think often of the light of allah or when we tend to think of the presence of allah we tend to always think about a celestial heavenly thing we tend to think of something that's quite distant that's quite out there over and above us somewhere in a distant realm um but in reality the reality of allah as the first and the last the outward the hidden the hidden and the outward or the inward and the outward the reality of allah is such that he encompasses all things his divine name and hate means that he encompasses all things but it also means that he is encountered not only in the most distant inward reality but also in the most visible most apparent physical realities around us one of the most amazing things about islam is the manner in which it gives the reality of appearances and the reality of the physical world such dignity in many religious traditions to escape to to encounter allah means to escape the physical world they've escaped the material world islam the quran describes heaven in very sensual material terms and the physical world is described in very spiritual terms both the physical world and the spiritual world are created by los patala they're realities that are manifested by the divine names and so no part of existence is denigrated no part of existence is bad or negative all of reality around us is actually uh nothing but the traces of the divine names nothing but the signs of allah nothing but things that are underpinned by the face of god and a lot of the poetry of the muslim mystics like rumi hathas razdali and many others we find these wonderful descriptions of encountering the face of allah in everything wherever you turn there is the face of god many commentators have read this verse suggesting uh that although we turn towards mecca in our prayers in order to encounter allah in reality allah is nowhere and everywhere at the same time and so we can encounter the face of allah the face of god in everything in everything he has a sign that indicates that he is one and so in the reality in the physical reality of the trees and the pebbles and the stones and the rivers in the mountains we can encounter the reality of allah and this is what i mean by ground it's it's it's the quran suggests and it indicates and even pushes us in the direction of understanding that allah is encountered everywhere in the signs of nature around us the quran is full of references to the physicality of things the wind and the breeze the mountains and the streams and the colors of fruits and plants and animals in their diversity and so the encounter with allah is not through a flight from the world that is largely all an encounter with the traces of the divine names in this world and hence the term ground by ground we mean the very foundation upon which we stand the earth upon which we walk everything is rooted in this earth the constant references in the quran to the heavens and the earth should always remind us that a flight to allah is not always uh towards the heavens it's also always also towards the earth simultaneously and so the luminous ground the term luminous ground really captures the dual meaning of both a celestial heavenly light and also the very foundations upon which we exist in this world i love this image of this grass moss extending beyond the forest floor in order to cover the trees almost um breaking that kind of boundaries uh and between tree and forest floor between trees and plants the reality of existence is that it's all interconnected part of one tapestry interwoven the warped weft being the divine names as they interweave the tapestry of existence and so the luminous ground then we encounter in nature the quality that enlivens us that brings us life that makes us happy that fills our soul with joy and bliss is nothing but the reality of god an atheist may not encounter uh this reality in all his luminosity and perhaps call of god but nonetheless uh every everyone even the atheist encounters it and describes nature in these in these same terms the muslim of course knows that this reality that is encountered is hazy reality that seems to subtend that seems to support that seems to um course through all things in existence is nothing but the reality of the divine names through his divine name the breath of the compassionate one that causes through all things this is the luminous ground we are talking about you might be thinking by now that what has all of this to do with architecture this makes sense in relation to our nature but how is it all related to architecture well a hint what if the quality of life and wholeness that i've been talking about just found that in nature what if this luminous ground that we encounter in nature could be extended into the world of man-made objects what if walking through a town felt like walking through a forest what if setting sitting in a chair felt like sitting on the earth what if walking between two trees was similar to walking through between through a doorway for example what if the same quality enlivening quality that we encounter in the natural world could be extended into the man-made world this is how uh i'm going to link architecture to the limitless grammar inshallah if we consider these two images on the left hand you have the field of architecture as a profession as a discipline and on the right hand side you have architecture in the field you have an empty field uh rolling hills of course the image on the right the field of nature is absolutely beautiful absolutely stunning now the question is if we are to as is out as our manner on earth as the of allah on earth we have an amana the stewardship over the natural world and so whenever we construct something whenever we make something whenever the field of architecture intervenes in the natural field or architecture in the field we have to ask ourselves the following question unless whatever it is that we build is of equal beauty to this field unless we're replacing this beautiful field with something equally beautiful it's a travesty it's a crime to build something less beautiful otherwise what we're doing what the human or man-made world is doing is creating ugliness covering over and destroying the natural beauty of the last part isla and creating uh ugliness in its place but it doesn't have to be like that i reminded of a comment made by one scholar once who said not all architecture fits or is is fitting to replace the great and empty fields uh of um our lovely countryside but he went on to say but if something like cambridge this is an image of cambridge of course if the cambridge colleges were to extend indefinitely into the english countryside it would be a most welcome thing indeed and the reason being is because you can see from the right hand side to the left-hand side increasingly as the colleges extend into the natural paddocks and and empty meadows of cambridgester they add lovely beautiful ancient courtyards with immaculately designed gardens and so what is being replaced the empty meadows that are being replaced are being replaced by something equally beautiful if not in some in some instances more beautiful so we do have the capacity to extend and create beauty equal to natural beauty but in most instances especially in the 20th century we failed to do so the question becomes how do we recover this capacity to create such beauty i'm going to try to engage in a bit of a theological reflection on the root of as uh seen kef noon uh the term exists and is mentioned several times in the quran and what's so remarkable about this term is it can provide perhaps a foundation for a new theology of the built environment in islam a new theology of dwelling in several places in the quran the root comes in a variety of different forms and it has a variety of different meanings to do well to live to find peace find rest to find tranquility in other derivations it also has the meaning of to rest resting place reassurance and also it has the meaning of sakina tranquility it's linked to the word sakina so if you go back a little bit we are adam lives with his wife in heaven the male and female were created for one another that they may find peace and rest with one another and the sakina is has the meaning of course of tranquility the spirit of tranquility that last allows to descend upon the hearts of the believers and then we have the term masakim dwellings houses buildings which uh it's peppered throughout the quran one might be able to derive from the root of these these three trilateral root is the idea of tranquility peace dwelling so one might say that what is if one were asked what is the core uh objective or reason for architecture in this world or man-made structures it is to dwell in tranquility and peace in this world and i will unravel more of this theology of sakhana in the next few lectures inshallah but i wanted to just put this out there at this stage because it really helped me reformulate the way in which i understand our human existence if adam in heaven is meant to dwell in paradise and there was eldercare for jannah the idea of existing or dwelling in heaven is one of absolute joy and tranquility and when allah says that he created um their their husband and wife so that they may find shakina they might find sakina or kun or tranquility with one another it suggests also that these root terms suggest a coexistence or dwelling with one another that is full of peace and repose and the term sakina and masaikin also suggest that our dwellings our buildings our houses are ones that are supposed to shelter a tranquil peaceful existence both in terms of one another families who exist with one another both in terms of town and city and communal life but also in terms of the relationship between human life and the earth itself we cannot call buildings messaging if they are sources of not serenity and repose but alienation and anxiety and a lot of the architecture of the modern world is the exact opposite of this this sukun now now we come to the crux of the mata the link between architecture and nature if nature is objectively and universally beautiful and alive can human designs be as objectively beautiful and alive as the themes of nature if you look at this wonderful bridge built across this river and the uh the cottage at the end of that bridge overgrown with plants almost like nature reclaiming the building in many ways one can describe the mountain in the background and the river in the foreground in the same terms as one describes the bridge and the cottage they fit there they belong there they have given the natural material used and the beauty of their forms and the wonderful grace graceful way in which the bridge and the house age and the way they kind of sprout out of the natural landscape without doing any violence to the natural order of things they seem to be alive as as the trees are alive and the river is alive and so if we ask ourselves can man-made objects partake in their objective beauty the kind of beauty that is eternal and transcends the ravages of time and the limitations of taste and style what might be inclined to say yes are buildings capable of healing us connecting us confronting us with our fitra the answer is yes and only one only has to recall their experience with many traditional buildings and towns around the world to remember and to recall how they kind of heal us and connect us to something deeper in a ways that many modern buildings don't can we create buildings that actualize support tranquility peace repose in god many people who move out into the countryside purchase old properties traditional buildings and live in proximity to nature will say that these buildings are more conducive to a spiritual life more conducive to being closer to allah than the concrete jungles of our modern cities and there's a reason why it's because the buildings are almost living artifacts they're alive uh sharing in the kind of life and beauty that we find in the natural world whether it's the bridge centuries old bridge that cross stream without doing violence to the banks of the river itself by deploying and using natural materials and a gentle arch over the river or whether it's the layers and layers of different kinds of material sourced from local quarries around the area reflecting the um the palette the texture the color of the region itself many of these buildings do indeed actualize a certain degree of support in fact if we were to draw sakura in architectural forms and terms it will probably be one of these arches of the bridge or one of the archers of that building there sitting there in repose peacefully fully balanced traveling through any of the traditional towns built in the past one comes across a quality almost like a reverie a dream or a nostalgia in fact the very term nostalgia nostros suggests that it's a journey of homecoming has a nostalgia for home because one pines for that which he or she has lost and so when we walk stroll down one of these cotswold villages in the english countryside we often feel like we've come home even though we may be visiting the place for the first time and the reason being is because it connects us to something deeper something that is soulful whether it's the cotswold or the hilltop towns of tuscany or any one of the beautiful streets in rome or the beehive city of fez but feels like one is at the center of something very profound one is entering into an entirely different world from the world of our modern cities that explains partly why we flock to these traditional standscapes it also explains why we find these places warm soulful and home it's indeed because we have arrived home i remember many of my own travels around many traditional cities and towns around the world wherever i i traveled to as long as it was a traditional city built in harmony with nature as most traditional cities were and villages i felt like i was home even if i were visiting the place for the first time that speaks volumes for the kind of alienation we have for our modern cities we can live in the same place in a large concrete jungle for decades and not feel at home and yet to visit the countryside once or a old village and immediately feel like we've arrived home to have the same effect as nature man-made objects must be pulsating with the same degree of life found in nature visiting a traditional town or sitting in a quaker chair one comes away with a feeling that one has been deeply moved and touched by something profound [Music] consider the cobbled streets of siena on the right with those beautiful archers and the several centuries of different kinds of materials all quarried from the soil of sienna herself outside the city the soil of the tuscan countryside or immediately around siena gives that color to the bricks news in the buildings one can describe them as living somehow they use a quality that is timeless that somehow brings us closer to the nature of things one of the most amazing things about natural material which we'll talk about in the next lecture is that they age with grace they age by showing duration by showing time by showing the millions of years of the rock's formation and in the very instance in which we perceive and encounter these these types of materials we immediately come in touch with the antiquity of the earth itself we come into touch in contact with something very profound very ancient that's why i refer to them as living artifacts and they're living and alive and natural not only because they resemble things in nature if you look at these lower two images these are the mokarnas used in islamic architecture quite extensively they look like stalactites that you find in caves or a beehive in this structure of course anything all traditional architecture seems to resemble the natural world because as i said earlier before the modern period architects and artists always looked to nature for emulation and they derived the principles for doing great architecture from the very principles and patterns and order found in nature which is soon at the life and hulk by extracting sunnah to life at hulk by extracting these proportions these harmony found in actual world they believed that they could create similar type of beauty in their own objects and so indeed we find the resemblances not only in their abortion and harmony but also sometimes in the form itself looking at this horseshoe arch in the great mosque cordoba for example one cannot help but feel like one is looking at a living thing complete balanced perfect centered or the cornerless dome on the right hand side in the alhamara as it unfolds from a center some scholars have described this pattern as the blossoming of the breath of the compassionate one as it opens up so at the very center there's a darkness of non-existence and from there creation opens up like a flower the breath of the compassionate one opens up into and becomes creation that creates the world and seeing this in person one feels a dynamic movement of the flower or the breath as it unfolds everyone feels very much in the presence of a cosmic mystery at the very center of being itself the moment before creation as it unfolds or this quaker chair is something quite lively not only because it is handmade that only because there are imperfections in it because of course in at least in the islamic tradition the imperfections of things are part of their perfections but also because of the natural material it has a certain serenity about it a certain repose that many modern industrial chairs simply do not have the natural material used in their chair of course does suggest that it is an extension of nature into the man-made world but not only that not only that its subtle harmonious forms simplicity and its unpretentious nature it just is the city of fez of course with its beehive-like courtyards seems like an organic mass naturally generated out of the landscape itself any outsider who comes into the city not familiar with its organic form and structure and the manner in which it gradually grew out of a center may get lost in the city but it does have an order it does have a rhythm but it's the rhythm of nature it's not the rhythm of straight lines it's not downtown manhattan with its first street and second street and third street monotonous repetition of the same the kind of repetitions we find in nature are not the same or identical the repetitions of the similar two no two leads are the same or identical yet they are very similar the kind of repetition we find in nature is not monotonous but rather enriching no two snowflakes are the same either if the curl that generates the growth of a snowflake identical in each case the kind of diversity we find in the natural world is the kind of diversity that we find most appealing and the kind of diversity we find peace in and that's the kind of diversity that you find in the growth of many traditional towns or if we look on the right hand side this wonderful black forest hut overlooking the german countryside the black forest sits there almost as if it had sprouted out of the landscape all traditional townscapes or traditional buildings or traditional craft works have the quality of a living thing of course there are exceptions there are many designs from the past that don't fit this bill not every building built in the past and every city designed were designed according to these same principles but by and large the majority of towns villages and things produced do have this quality and if you look at any one of these objects if it is beautiful then it has achieved the quality of wholeness that is found in nature and is very much alive this town here in southern morocco looks like it was generated from the landscape itself the mud brick material used is sourced locally architectural forms rise into the sky the pattern and color fit in with the landscape a beautiful building full of life may be defined as one that reposes peacefully where it is and instills such repose within whoever perceives it this is what a very famous author john ruskin calls living architecture it is whole and holy ghetto the german poet calls it life enhancing so there are human artefacts that we can call living not only are they alive but they are life enhancing because in the presence of them we feel more alive they heal because there is sensation in every introvert a determined variation in arrangement such as we find in the related proportions in the structure or organic forms there's a profound similarity between the beauty of traditional buildings most traditional buildings and the beauty and proportions and the structure of organic forms that we find in nature traditional buildings then and craft work have this timeless even luminous quality the quality of being alive though man-made they feel organic as though nature herself had produced them they were molded into their present form over long periods think of the this street here in a small village in england each one of these buildings was moulded into their present form over long periods of time which despite the upheavals of cultural diversity they all possess a shared vision and a common set of values it is true that the act of making is a result of ad-hoc acts of construction and production over long periods of time but despite these intimate acts of incremental making and refining they sit side by side over the centuries with an extraordinary level of coherence one of the most amazing things about traditional cities is though they were designed and built through ad hoc acts of construction over centuries and centuries and centuries they maintain a certain degree of coherence about them because they are underpinned by a principle that is very similar throughout the ages shared by all those who built them and that is that they emulate the principles of nature herself most modern cities don't have this quality because most modern architects do not follow the pattern of nature but they follow the whims of their own egos and their own desires and so each building stands out as a stunt contracts contrast to the next one and the next one and the next one whereas this traditional village here for example take them together they form an ecosystem of living things that could not be other than what they are and where they are much like any unique ecosystem of trees stones birds plants and insects cannot be what they are in that particular place i'm sure you'll agree with me when i say that an empty plot of land um is beautified by the extension of buildings like this upon it that these kind of structures ennoble the field the empty field rather than destroy it though man-made this traditional hilltop town of italy feels organic as though nature herself had produced it it grows out of the rocky outcrop because it draws on the same material and the same principles that govern the growth of the rocks themselves observe the effect that these objects have on us if each and every one of you just recalls strolling through a beautiful old street in istanbul or the old back streets of damascus or many of the traditional villages and towns around the world one feels that they events are deep feeling an echo of our very soul a mirror of our deepest self and they rouse in us certain trains of meditation in the mind binabi once beautiful said certain places have an effect and leave traces and sensitive hearts imagine being true places have an effect on our hearts and so the more the place is in tune with the nature of things the more the place is in harmony with the natural order the more it instills within us the same pattern the same natural harmony in the midst of this atmospheric embrace of these living artifacts it is easy to lose all track of time in a traditional town nature and artifice are in collusion here and the effect is magical mysterious and sacred almost a mirror of our fitra in fact according to traditional understandings of architecture architecture art or man-made artifacts are supposed to mirror alpha they're supposed to be designed according to patterns and proportions of harmony found in the natural order so that when we walk through the streets of these towns when we use the objects they act as mirrors of our fithra mirrors of perfections mirrors of proportional ideals that we aspire to become and embody in our day-to-day lives when we walk through a traditional town its natural proportions its natural harmony reconfigure our very existence reconfigure our constitution and align us with the natural proportions and harmony they embody thereby calling us back to our natural self to our fifa indeed it is the same quality of life that animates the beauty of nature and the beauty of traditional craft works a community of feeling advanced by an overall harmony across both once the quality of life is achieved in these man-made objects they attain an intensity of being that is boundless one can imagine the things of this world as a spider web of a network of nodes as it were or not everything being a node or not and the they're connected by a thread to another node or another knot now the more our objects and artifacts possess its degree of life in them the more they emulate the beauty and life found in nature the more intense they become as nodes that grant access to being itself or to the luminous ground the word artifacts no longer really captures the true meaning they are best described as living things look at this image on the right hand side for example it's the north portal entrance to a mosque mosque in turkey all living structures glow with a luminous quality one has the feeling that one is gazing at something beyond configuration of the physical qualities of the object one in a sense feels that one is in contact with what is beyond the merely physical that somehow one has entered a portal into the metaphysical these portals these nodes become intense degrees intense moments of light through which we penetrate beyond the merely physical there are webs of meaning and values that are multi-layered and afford never repeatable rich existential experiences their nodes of light the shine brightest and darkness of our existence founts of a divine presence that cascades down through all creation we're looking at this north portal entrance once again one feels like the very materiality as it were or the stone itself had been transformed intensified and the intrinsic life that pulsates through all things somehow made visible made palpable made tangible the portal to the mosque then becomes a portal into the luminous ground itself what is felt is not a visual quality but that which is always behind it the face of god in things the luminous ground so yes once again in architecture we can find the luminous ground we can encounter the face of god in things because so long as man-made world becomes an extension of the perfection and beauty harmony proportion and order found in nature then it can uh achieve the same kind of effects as a natural world in later weeks inshallah i'll be talking about the creativity of the artist and the extent to which the artist and the architect are able to infuse their works with certain qualities that allah has uniquely granted to two human beings so in the next three weeks in chola next few talks i'm going to be talking about um a number of things let me break it down in the following way for those of you not familiar with aristotle's notion of four causes aristotle says that everything in existence must have four causes everything has a has four causes and this is something that has been also articulated within islamic thought itself so if we think of a dining table for example the first cause of a dining table is its material course i.e the wood so that's the first cause material cause the thing that the table is made of the formal cause is the form it takes the shape it takes at the very end as the formal cause or design and then it has an efficient cause the efficient causes the carpentry or the carpenter himself as he works through with his tools in order to create the table and the final cause of course is dining the reason why we have a dining table is to enjoy the experience of dining likewise if we use the same analogy for architecture we can say that architecture has also four causes there is the material cause the material out of which a building is built there is the formal cause the form the material is given the efficient cause the designer who gives form to the material and the labor that goes into it and the final cause of course is the overall objective of the building itself and throughout this presentation i've been uh talking about this final cause really the final cause ultimately of architecture is that it is a space uh it is a dwelling that allows us to repose in tranquility in the presence of allah ultimately yes architecture has other objectives people may build a house because they need shelter people may build a mosque to worship people may build the office building for office offices but ultimately underpinning all these secondary reasons why we do build things ultimately the whole purpose of dwelling on this earth the whole purpose of dwelling in dwellings in buildings is that it is though or the final cause of it all really ultimately is that it provides us with this link and this connection to the luminous ground so i have already covered this final course in this presentation in china in the next few weeks what i want to do is go back in detail now and discuss the materiality of buildings so next week i'll talk about material i won't talk about anything else but the material and how the very material materiality of buildings connect us to the luminous ground and how we can recover the sacred art of building towns and villages and buildings and works of art that connect us to allah then in the second week at the third week sorry i'll be talking about the form the material is given and we're talking about here about spaces about archers about domes the various types of forms that the material takes and then what are the types of what are the qualities required of the designer in order to produce this kind of sacred architecture or this produce this quality of of life in in man-made buildings in charma so that's the formal end of the presentation in charlotte uh i will be going to q a now um i'm going to stop sharing inshaallah and see if we have any uh any questions on the other end of the line inshallah are there any questions in the chat box or any questions live questions we don't seem to have any questions so far inshallah are there any questions on youtube perhaps no okay we'll just leave it at that inshaallah and uh we'll resume uh inshaallah uh god willing next week i do apologize for my my cold and i do up and i apologize once again for starting late for the technical issues but we will be seeing you inshallah next week\n\nhere's an article:\nRecovering Conscious Design\nDr Samir Mahmoud\nScholar & Lecturer at the Cambridge Muslim College\nIn this conversation series, we explore design as a spiritual practice with creative leaders, spiritual teachers, and start-up founders from around the world. Here, Peter Gould interviews Dr Samir Mahmoud; globally respected scholar, lecturer at the Cambridge Muslim College and expert on traditional spirituality and classical architecture studies.\nShare this article\nIn recent years, Dr Samir’s teachings and guidance has been instrumental in helping me frame my own thinking around the role of design. In this conversation, we delved into the relationship between spirituality and creativity, and explored how contemporary designers might discover a deeper consciousness to their practice.\n\nMy first encounter with Dr Samir Mahmoud was an advert for his lecture entitled Islam and Pop Culture: A Muslim’s Guide to Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. I was immediately drawn in by the title, but what followed was a far more profound journey of learning than I could have imagined.\n\nSamir’s warm, highly articulate teaching style opened a new set of perspectives for my own journey into understanding the role of design and imagination from a spiritual perspective. I proceeded to enthusiastically take over the entire Q&A session, and we soon found ourselves in a series of enlightening conversations in cafes, small gatherings and his inspiring lectures.\n\nHe quickly became a good friend, guide, and mentor who has helped me to navigate various concepts and ideas within the realms of art, architecture and aesthetics; and increasingly exploring the concept of khayaal, or ‘spiritual imagination’.\n\nA long-time student of the meaning and meeting-place of spirituality and design, the Australia-born Lebanese academic has toured the Mediterranean and Middle East on an intellectual journey rooted in existential questions about our relationship to the space around us.\n\nDuring this journey he has immersed himself in the study of economics, politics, anthropology, philosophy, theology and more in his pursuit of spiritual truths and the recovery of conscious design.\n\nDuring one of our recent conversations, Dr Samir discussed the design of physical spaces – buildings in particular – and why traditional designs resonate with us, no matter where in the world they were created.\n\n“They consistently express the eternal immutable principles of beauty, which can be amazingly articulated in an infinite variety of ways – each one in its own cultural manner,” he told me.\n\n“When you see it, you connect deeply to that immutable eternal aspect. Some of us may find the specific cultural expression not to our taste, but nonetheless, there's a serenity, a proportionality and beauty to the building that's undeniable.\n\n“Today, you rarely go to see the latest skyscraper unless you’re an architectural student. You go to see these wonderful traditional cities, towns and villages. Why? Because they’re trying to recover something we’ve lost. Something fundamental.”\n\nThis sense of loss is something I’ve been acutely aware of on my own design journey, which has taken me from Sydney to Stanford, and across various parts of Asia and the Middle East. As energetic and creative as Silicon Valley’s colourful design studios might be, and as productive as Dubai’s innovation accelerators have proven, there is a missing richness – something absent from the conversation. Almost like the soul and purpose of our generation of designers may have forgotten something vital.\n\n‍Built for blessings\n‍Commenting further, Dr Samir highlighted what he believes is missing, and what we can still find in traditional design: Experience. An emotional connection to the space.\n\n“You feel it,” he said. “You feel it in the rising of the columns and the fanning out of the gothic vaults of the cathedrals. You feel it in the geometric patterns that kind of move across the surface of a wall, such as in many traditional Muslim buildings.\n\n\"It is why you're able to relate to the humane and human quality of a hand-crafted object. There's something intangible about it that's transferred. You can call it the Barakah. You can call it the eternal quality”.\n“It is why you’re able to relate to the humane and human quality of a hand-crafted object. There’s something intangible about it that’s transferred. You can call it the Barakah (Arabic for ‘blessings’, or ‘abundance’). You can call it the eternal quality. Whatever it is, it has many names. It’s something that machines simply cannot do. Especially with synthetic material. Wood oozes a warmth that concrete simply does not and cannot.”\n\nBut in today’s machinated world, where does that leave us? Where and how do we find that Barakah? Will we have to abandon our devices, cancel our Adobe subscriptions and return to the woodworking bench?\n\nAs designers, we have to find a way to connect to what has been lost; learn from the principles of older times, and infuse them in our modern world.\n\nI asked Dr Samir how contemporary designers can conserve spirituality and unlock potential in today’s age, while avoiding the pitfalls of technology.\n\n“Beauty is that which breaks down the barriers between myself and the world, enhances the quality of life within me, and draws out the quality of life in things; bridging the illusion of separation that we have with all things.”\nHe said: “Beauty is that which breaks down the barriers between myself and the world, enhances the quality of life within me, and draws out the quality of life in things; bridging the illusion of separation that we have with all things.”\n\nThat, then, might be our timeless design challenge. And while it’s up to each of us to decide how to respond, Dr Samir offers some guidance in how to return to a traditional mindset.\n\n“We have to consciously recover and re-inculcate a certain set of ideas, behaviours, and habits that were implicit and almost unconsciously practiced in traditional cultures.”\n“The challenging thing is we now have to consciously recover and re-inculcate a certain set of ideas, behaviours, and habits that were implicit and almost unconsciously practiced in traditional cultures.\"\n\n“One of the challenges then, as a scholar, when looking back at traditional cultures, is finding where the books that talk about design are. They didn’t really produce them. Instead, they inherited thousands of years of wisdom, and that was handed down in what we now call embodied knowledge.”\n\nThis type of carried knowledge is learned, acquired, and perpetuated over time through practice rather than discourse or how-to guides. But while this makes perfect sense for a traditional mosaic craftsman in Fes or a calligrapher in Istanbul, how do contemporary designers try to reconcile their spirituality?\n\nDr Samir added: “I think it's a very difficult question to answer because it's not supposed to be a consciously contrived one. It ought to be a product of an implicit process that has become part and parcel of who one is.\"\n\n“I used to teach at a design school for many years. They don't teach you any of this stuff. None of it. I would have no clue what the first design manual would look like for a group like this, but it's something definitely worth exploring and worth doing.”\n\nRecovering awe\nConversations with Dr Samir always leave my soul more assured and my mind racing with an excess of new questions.  During another visit we discussed nature. More specifically, the awe and majesty of the natural world that we feel and connect with for creative inspiration. \n\n“Anyone who's ever perceived a beautiful landscape feels that they are connecting to something deep within themselves, not just external to themselves.”\n“Anyone who's ever perceived a beautiful landscape feels that they are connecting to something deep within themselves, not just external to themselves,” he said, before explaining that we sometimes miss the point by reducing the experience to informational exchange. \n\n“The eucalyptus tree is a genus that includes several species of gum trees that exist in the Southeast part of Australia. Which is useful to know, right? But what am I gaining from understanding that this particular tree, with its particular roots emerging on the edge of my pathway, belongs to an abstract category called ‘eucalyptus trees’ that exists along the East Australian coast?\"\n\n“It's useful in a certain domain of existence for scientific understanding of the world, but what if we were to recover the immediacy of the Qur'anic descriptions of the natural world as perpetual blossomings of phenomenon at that particular moment? What if we were to recover the Qur'anic sense of wonder?\n\n“When the Qur'an invites you to look at the camel or look at a mountain or look at a tree or the stars, and it talks about its creation, it's also inviting you to an immediate perception in that particular instance – the birth of that particular unique phenomenon at that particular moment as a manifestation of a divine name to you and to you only.\"\n\n“And so, you can almost say that there are two ways of possibly perceiving the natural world. There's the path of Dhawq which is often called ‘tasting’. And there's the path of detached logical reasoning. Both are useful, but each one gives you something different.”\n\nThe notion of Dhawq, he explained, also relates to the removal of a veil; taking away a “conceptual approach to phenomenon” in order to allow one to immediately “plunge into the reality of things at that particular instant”.\n\nHe said that it allows us to get to the ‘here and now’ - the present moment.\n\n“When I say Dhawq, it is in terms of cultivating a certain way of seeing the natural world, because we already have the correspondence with the natural world around us. We already have that intrinsic relationship.\"\n\n“It’s about removing the obstacles that culture, society, our upbringing, and our education somehow laid upon our path and veiled this intrinsic relationship we have with them.\n\nDeeper conversations\nWhen I asked Dr Samir why this removal would be important for designers, he told me it was about their responsibility to the world.\n\n“When you get to a process like design, where human beings directly intervene in the natural world around them, unless we’ve cultivated a heart-based approach to the world, in which we allow things to be what they are meant to be, our intervention in the world around us becomes a fundamental act of violence.”\n\nIt was a strong choice of words, and I wanted to understand how we would consider that in practical terms. How do we ensure we develop this harmonious connection?\n\nDr Samir continued: “I used to try experiments with students in architectural design. I would encourage them to engage in a dialogue with the landscape itself. You might think, okay, this is too much mystical thinking - this is a design school for crying out loud. But I did see the results in the students and their designs.\"\n\n“Even today, after completing their PhDs and now working in firms, they still contact me and say ‘you gave us a valuable lesson in life and design'.\"\n\n“Now there are architects who have actually developed methods centred around this concept. You talk to the landscape; only then might the landscape talk back.”\n\nContemplating Dr Samir’s words, I envisioned his students – wondering at their experiences and thoughts during this process, and how their interaction with the space around them might project into their minds and their hearts.\n\nThe traditional designs that were a result of these more natural, organic connections to the world would surely have elicited deeper levels of connection; aligning mental experiences of perception with a harmony of the heart. Perhaps opening access to our spiritual imagination the concept of Khayaal that Dr. Samir explained to me.\n\nIt is no wonder, then, that some talk to the landscapes. And as eccentric as it may seem, their success in modern times has precedence.\n\nDr Samir explained: “Louis Kahn, one of the famous architects of the 20th century, was quite mystical - deeply steeped in Jewish Kabbalah. Though I don’t think he got the design of buildings quite right, nonetheless I think his design approach was interesting. He used to say ‘Oh, brick, what do you want to be, brick?’ This is literally what he used to do for about three hours in his design studio with students - ask a brick what it wants to be.\n\n“The idea here isn’t to have a schizophrenic dialogue with an object that you think is speaking back to you. The idea is that in the same way a plant or tree or rock emerges under the influence of several factors in the landscape, and seems to belong nowhere else but in that particular place in dialogue with its surrounds, we can engage in internalising several factors of the landscape in such a way that it speaks to us. Suggesting and hinting what the design should be, rather than what I wanted it to be.\"\n\n“It comes back to the idea of allowing one to express the individuality of the building through the architect, rather than expressing the individuality of the architect through the building. The leading architects today, who are winning big awards developing the philosophy of design based on this, they talk about the heart. They talk about cultivating deep feelings. They talk about this and they're now starting to use it.”\n\nWhatever the reasons for this loss of connection to the landscape, and to our own hearts, it was encouraging to hear Dr Samir talk about this revival of sorts – especially against the modern day backdrop of hyper-technology, design for distraction, and increase in materiality.\n\nAs designers, we would all do well to try to rekindle this connection – to foster it, let it inspire our work, and help us to recover a more conscious, heart-centered approach to design.\n\nAnd here's session two of the luminous ground video:\nwelcome to session two of architecture and the luminous ground uh i want to apologize for last week i was quite ill and i wasn't able to finish what we started uh last week but this week insha'allah um we'll do exactly that so um i promised last week that we would move on to uh the second lecture the second lecture now is really a continuing continuation of uh the first week in sha allah the title of this one is um the human being is a microcosm and it's a continuity from what we did before in the sense that last week we covered the topic of the luminous ground in terms of nature so we saw that underpinning the very fabric of reality existence and the natural world is the luminous ground or the ground of being itself and we saw that in the beauty of nature in the glory of nature we encounter the face of god in all things and we also discussed the same issue of discovering the luminous ground and the face of god also in human artefacts and we said that all things are very much alive because all things participate in life given that all are given life by the divine name the living one and so theoretically of course that means all things even things man-made can be occasions and signs for uh traces of the divine names or allah signs uh in the world but in order for that to happen in order for the artifacts or human artifacts or human creations to be uh of that type of quality to be able to reflect the face of god in things they have to be created designed molded crafted following a set of patterns order harmony and principles uh as those found in the natural world um i didn't talk as much about the human being and the role of the human being in this one but i'll try to shed a bit more light on that in this session inshallah so bismillah now if one were to ask oneself what happened exactly with this transition or this shift why is it that we somehow possess this remarkable understanding of the luminous ground in traditional cultures and why has it somehow fundamentally disappeared from our modern culture in order to do that really uh particularly its disappearance from western culture and then the transmission of that kind of uh attitude and that sensibility to the rest of the world through colonization and globalization we find ourselves as muslims also participating in this inability to really perceive the science of allah in the world and also unable to continue producing the kind of beauty in art and architecture that we once were able to do before the modern world and the answer to that really is that there has been a fundamental reorientation an orientation or a shift from a world view of traditional cultures or the middle ages into the modern world view and this has to be really put in the foreground in our understanding in order to understand how it has uh traumatized our bodies our mind our souls our heart and how it is it has renders us unable to connect with the spiritual reality of the world around us it's not so much that we live in a different age than they did a lot of people especially modern sensibilities will say the only difference between the middle ages and our age is that you know they live in a different age a different time period and it's actually something much more radical than that we don't even seem to inhabit the same world we don't inhabit the same uh understanding um uh how the same conceptualization of of the relationship between things in the world uh this fundamental reorientation happened a few centuries ago we're not going to get into that in detail that would require a long uh seminar in philosophy but it is important to foreground that those who built the medieval town that we admire so much those who produce the great mosques the beautiful towns churches and streets that we so admire in a lot of pre-modern architecture they inhabited an entirely different world from the world of our own and so part of a restoring some of that beauty in this world is to recover the cosmology uh the recover the worldview to recover uh that world in which they inhabit it these two images here are quite uh telling in the sense that they juxtapose uh the beauty and harmony sensibility of traditional architecture at least in europe with the kind of modernist and post-modern architecture that's quite common uh today believe it or not uh the buildings on the right have been have won awards as a great examples of of architecture so how did we go from the images on the left with the image on the right it's not just a shift in architectural style it's actually fundamentally a shift in world view of shifting cosmology a shift in philosophy a shift in religious spiritual epistemological understandings of the world in an important series of studies the american historian of middle ages edward krantz argued that the transition from a ancient consciousness or pre-modern consciousness to modern consciousness is a qualitative transition from one world to another in the sense that we don't no longer inhabit the same world so when we look at the stars when we look at the trees when we look at nature we never see the same things that they saw in the middle ages according to krantz for aristotle the soul is somehow all beings which is why it can know all things and know them in such a way that in what is without matter what thinks and what is thought are the same and essentially what this means is that there's some kind of an ontological continuity between what happens in our mind within us within ourselves and what happens in the actual world itself the ancients he says experience an awareness that was open to what lay around them and they experienced no sense of this kind of radical dichotomy between their own awareness and everything else what they found in their own minds or intellect was of like character with much of what was outside it let me explain that uh with a with a with an example krantz articulates the kind of self that once inhabited or we once inhabited as it were the ancient self the ancient self of this kind of cosmology ontology as the extensive self and what he means by the extensive self is a self that is somehow extended into the world and part of a single continuous realm of being here the soul is a microcosm of the macrocosm and the cosmos is the soul writ large today we often tend to think that myself uh my soul or myself that ends at the tip of my skin or my tiptoe of my fingers at the edge of my skin we tend to think of ourselves as creatures that inhabit a body but whose consciousness whose awareness whose sense of self is also contained within this body this is a very novel very new understanding of the human being in fact in many ancient cultures the self did not end at the edge of my skin but rather it extended to include the entire world our soul is something though uh embodied in a body it belongs essentially and is linked with a wider realm of reality that binds all things together so if we look at the example of this wonderful uh garden in cambridge it's called the sunken garden uh claire college very beautiful garden i've spent many many years uh on that bench on the left and the right sometimes sitting beneath that those two apple trees in the back it's a lily pond in the middle and there are york dry stone walls on the edges of that sunken garden with flowers um surrounding the sunken garden on the edge of this of the garden itself there is a hedge a high hedge so if you're inside the garden you can't really see beyond that edge and you can't really see beyond those higher trees in the distance and so when one enters into this garden as it were one feels a sense of enclosure as it were the only openness is towards the sky itself now if i were to enter into this garden that's a crude image i do apologize for my uh very basic drawing skills but there's a an image of an individual let's say you and i entering into this garden there we often tend to think that my self is some kind of a bubble that immediately surrounds my my body but as soon as you enter into this garden as soon as you step through the gate into the garden one immediately senses the harmony of the design the soothing effect of the greenery the perfect proportions and symmetry the the one smells of course and senses uh the aroma of the flowers one takes in the entire experience as a whole simultaneously within a fraction of a second if that is the case if we are affected moved transformed changed immediately by our encounter with things at a pre reflective level this suggests that myself is not a bubble enclosed within my body but rather that myself is actually a large bubble as it were that extends as far as my senses can perceive and even further and what that means is if i look up to the stars of the sky for example on an evening night and i move i'm deeply profoundly moved by the by the stars in the sky or i'm moved by the uh luminous moon what that suggests is myself or my experiential bubble extends far beyond just my skin it rather it takes in the entire world itself and what that suggests is that as we walk through and experience the world our self is extended across the entire landscape sky as far as uh i can actually see and even beyond which means that essentially my experiential bubble or my field of perception is as extended as the world itself and so uh to live live and inhabit in a world like this spontaneously at a very profound and primordial level is to live a self that is quite extensive um and uh not enclosed uh or intensive or concentrated within my own bodily existence and so that means that the kind of knowledge this extensive self produces the kind of knowledge it encounters is the kind of knowledge that krantz calls conjunctive in the sense that the noah and the known are united as one because perception is happening across a field that is a continuum things are known in an immediate manner because one is somehow conjoined or united uh with it now that comes to an end um with the modern age but in traditional cultures there was a whole philosophy and epistemology and cosmology surrounding this particular way of understanding the world in um in the introduction to mafate hellraib uh satellite a very famous muslim metaphysician makes the important observation which is a metaphysical principle simultaneously that the soul knows what is in the world because it already contains a world within it in potential so when we enter into our garden like this for example and i see the trees i see the plants i see the stones upon the water the sky the reason why i'm able to immediately perceive them is because i'm already connected to them at a deep and profound level that as a microcosm as a small image of the entire cosmos i already contain all the attributes all the qualities of all the things in the world another way of looking at it is to say that while the divine names manifest or are manifest and dispersed across the entire cosmos the human being is the only creature that contains all the divine names within itself and all the things in the cosmos are also contained within the human being such that when i perceive something external to myself a tree a moon a plant a paddock i'm actually perceiving something that already has or already exists within me this idea of correspondence or monastery is a very interesting principle of traditional cosmology it means basically that the human being is a microcosm of the microcosm or a mirror image of the entire universe and so when perceiving things external to myself i'm actually perceiving uh their external manifestation of a reality that already exists within me why because human existence was seen as a microcosm as something that is suspended or nested within a pattern of correspondences or structural resonances that link the human order to the divine order through sympathetic bonds and so imagine for example a thread a subtle thread that connects you to every single thing in creation and a thread that connects you to the divine name simultaneously in creation we exist within a circle within a circle within a circle within a circle and within each circle there's a correspondence a relationship correspondence or structural resonances such that when i perceive the natural world around me i'm perceiving the earthly manifestation of their equivalence in another level of being and at that level other level of being those are also articulations manifestations of the same realities as another level of being until you get all the way up to the highest level of the divine order so these theory of nested realities as it were or structural resonances that's what bind us and connect us to the things around us and then ultimately to uh to the divine reality william tritic in in one of his works mentions the work of a chinese scholar to weiming according to him the cosmos is perceived as an unfolding of an all-embracing continuous creativity in which all modalities are organically connected it's another way of saying basically that the fabric of reality is one it's in a process of perpetual creation faster than a blink of an eye and that everything is interconnected because of the everything consists of for everything is a trace of the divine names which constitute the fabric of reality reality therefore consists of a dynamic energy field in which all parts of the cosmos mutually interact in a spontaneously self-generating life process the images here on the right are quite interesting that show the kind of structural resonances and correspondences that are purely material and physical reality on the left-hand side there are neurons with synaptic connections on the right hand side is a cosmic web of cluster of galaxies and we can see our different scales of reality from the level of the neurons in our brains to the level of the interconnected cluster of galaxies same patterns govern different levels of reality this is purely at the physical level if we talk about the relationship between different ontological levels it's quite similar each level corresponds to a level above it and a level above it and a level above it and as long as we align ourselves with the intrinsic patterns of the fifth allah has deposited in the natural order of things we connect ourselves to the higher orders and insofar as we ignore these patterned relationships these nested relationships of structural resonances from the lowest reality to the highest we can disconnect ourselves from it and so while human beings are part of this cosmic web our minds and consciousness make us unique in that we are able to prove the transcendental anchorage of our nature and that means we have of course a divine principle within us the spirit the law that allows us to connect to that anchor that links us to the transcendental world and thereby achieve a sympathetic accord with the myriad of things in nature again this is reiterating the very fundamental idea that we are somehow at some level uh interconnected and this is what gives us a sense of deep or towards nature and the natural world the quran speaks of it as mizan or nizam order harmony in the cosmos it often asks the reader to look once and twice and three times to see if they can come across or discern or discover any disharmony and of course the answer is an absolute no one way to look at the divine injunctions and commands of the quran or the reason behind them is the example of the salat in the same way that the heliotrope the uh or the the sunflower here follows the sun as it moves across the sky there is this kind of intrinsic sympathy between the sunflower it's yellow color it's nourished from the light of the sun itself at the center of the sunflower of course is this wonderful fibonacci series spiral that's found everywhere in nature the flower follows the course of the sun across the sky it moves literally during the day following the sun another way of saying is to say the the flower follows a pattern or is aligned with a cosmic order that nourishes its very existence and allows it to flourish but allah commands us to pray it's not so much because allah is imposing a burden on us that he needs from us allah does not need our prayers but rather the prayer is a remarkable moment in which we escape from the everyday pattern of our life which is chaotic we escape from the everyday sense of calculative instrumental time we experience time on a daily basis in a very artificial way we escape from the experiential space and gestural movements that are very mechanical driven by desires and driven by motivations and driven by greed um what salat asks us to do is temporarily for five times a day to realign ourselves with a cosmic order and a cosmic rhythm so we escape the calculative uh instrumental time of the watch to insert ourselves into a cosmic time our prayer of course is regulated by the movement of the sun across the sky just like the sunflower and our fasting is also regulated by the moon a lot of our data are regulated by divine rhythms in nature so we we escape this uh everyday rhythm in order to insert ourselves into an eternal rhythm of time also we escape the gestural movements uh of uh snatching with our hand and plotting with greed and ambition uh moving our bodies toward in certain ways that are quite mechanical and for all sorts of different mixed motivations and reasons what we do is in prayer is we follow a pre pre-configured set of movements that are perfectly designed in order to align with the movement of creation itself and at the same time align with um in order to maximize our spiritual potential for ascent of course the salah is the center of the believer and in our physical movements downwards we spiritually ascend yeah and so the movements of salah put us in sympathetic accord with with things some of the scholars even say that the standing gestures the standing movement of salah is the quintessential human position of course there are four kingdoms in nature the human kingdom the animal kingdom the plant kingdom and the mineral kingdom the standing position corresponds to the human position the bowing corresponds to the movement of animals the sujud corresponds to the horizontal movement of plants and this reduced position corresponds to the stability and stillness of stone and so in the prayers itself there is this kind of remarkable realignment with with um with the divine order so turning back to krantz work on the transition from the ancient to the modern he warns us not to think of the ancient way of seeing things as some kind of a foolish thinking rather it's something quite radical with a very different way of knowing things in our mind we know things out there by having ideas of them in here today when i tend to think about i know something external to myself is because i have an idea of it in my mind and we've kind of fallen into this kind of solipsism where beyond this my own skin there's a world out there that my relationship to the world is not entirely clear how i uh know things against the ancient position in which sensation and intellection uh lead to conjunction and unity with things we find a dichotomy between the mind and what is outside it between meanings and things this is what's happened uh lately uh this shift to this kind of modern cosmology where the human being seems to be a creature that is completely cut off from the external world out there the first thing i ask myself when i um the first thing we tend to do is to ask how do i know for example that a tree is beautiful people often even doubt their experience it's a very bizarre thing to ask because at some deep and profound level we already know that a tree that way deeply connected to a tree or deeply connected to a meadow or we're deeply connected to a river and the beauty of nature we already feel the conjunction and union at some level but somehow the modern cosmology has has taken over and has trumped our immediate experience almost alpha threat experience and through some kind of cerebral gymnastics um we uh modern ideology which is fixation on rational thinking we tend to trump any sensed feeling of connection with the world with irrational uh skepticism about our ability to know things external to ourselves rather than the ancient extensive self as we spoke about earlier a self that is open to the world around it we find a move to an intensive self in the modern age a universe of meaning separated by a dichotomy from the world of things so whereas in the pre-free bottom period this this sense the self was understood to be something extended beyond the physical body um that the our own soul within us our own reality and the world soul somehow or the the the reality within a reality without somehow deeply connected we now live inhabit a world in which uh the intensive self occupies this physical body and with its own uh ideas somehow contained within our brain it's completely disconnected from the external world and so against an ancient reason an ancient type of thinking which is primarily a vision of what is we find ourselves now uh towards a situation in which reason is understood as a coherence of ideas or thoughts in our own mind whereas previously what it meant what it meant to exercise akon was to achieve a certain vision of unity of what reality actually is today we find ourselves when we say that a rational thought is actually nothing but a an internal coherence of ideas within my own mind so rational thinking no longer involves um an extension beyond the self towards understanding the intrinsic nature of things here but rather it now seems to just involve uh uh logical coherence within my own mind and what this leads to is the kind of very dangerous uh suspended self as it were the intensive self itself turned inwards produces disjunctive knowledge not knowledge where uh not knowledge that entails a union of the known and the known but rather a kind of knowledge that where there's a split between the noah and the known between meaning and things um and that somehow the only relationship between things is if i can establish some kind of internal coherence within my own mind and so knowledge now lacks all immediacy um and we end up with this kind of self that is suspended in a meaningless existence edward munch the expressionist artist in 20th century once walking with friends at sunset had this overwhelmingly bizarre experience in which he said i stood there trembling with anxiety at sunset and i sent an infinite screen passing through nature in this painting he really articulates the suspended self that lives in a meaningless existence and the anxiety associated with it now this modern western way of thinking about things which has now become global and it is important to point this out and explain it because we as muslims now have become as modern as everyone else to a large extent and we if we ask ourselves why we can no longer see the signs of allah and nature when he says we shall show them our signs upon the horizon within themselves uh when no longer able to see the trees or signs of gods and the sun is a sign of god it's likely largely because we are quintessentially modern individuals defined by a modern subjectivity and to a large extent we occupy intensive or we are intensive cells partially suspended in a meaningless existence um and we really need to seriously uh find ways out of this um if uh if we had to really reconnect with uh with the quran and and with the with the spiritual reality of the quran consummate urges us and and and encourages us to discover in the world and so this kind of western mode of thinking is is different from even alien to all previous cultures all previous thought but there's nothing normative about it there's nothing normal about it and the shift is not just a change in thinking about a change in experiencing the world today we can only experience the world as it once was sacred theophanies objects luminous with uh divine presence and so krantz concludes and it says the trust of my argument is not that there were different theories about the same seeing their knowing but rather that there were different scenes and knowings we it's not like we have a different theory about seeing and knowing that we don't see and know the thing the same things anymore we've lost a dimension of reality of course with the reductionism of science where everything is reduced to the physical plane and uh our knowledge of the world is reduced to purely rational approach to reality we use a fundamental uh dimension of of reality and the world around us and so we end up with this um what is often referred to as a cartesian dualism we end up with this subjectivism where we stand on this side of our reality the inner subjective world of the mind and the world out there somehow exists um objective outer reality but there seems to be a huge gulf between them the biggest questions in recent modern thinking have always been how can we know the reality of the external world around us now no one's denying that there is some kind of a subject object relationship we are aware that i'm something here and there's an external world out there to a certain extent but what i am suggesting here at least is that this is not the most immediate way in which we experience the world think about it from your own experience really you go about your business every day whether you're in prayer or when you're walking to work or whether you're traveling on a day-to-day experience experiential level we are immersed and reflectively in the world around us it's only when we start thinking when i start exercising my rational mind i start thinking about myself as a subject and i and then the world out there some kind of an object uh opposed to me somehow but in the most immediate immersive experiences of our day-to-day realities the world there is no dichotomy and so what that suggests is that beneath that kind of thinking of subject object there is something a more fundamental type of experience that's truthful to the reality of the world itself let me give an example you step out of the car and you're immediately in the presence of a beautiful landscape in a split second your most immediate response and interaction is pre-reflective or unreflective immersive immediate and holistic it's one whole total experience that you that overwhelmed you it's only later when i start thinking about this experience that i'm consciously aware that when i had that experience i was a subject looking at a landscape in the immediacy of the experience where immersed as one with the world around us and most of our experiences are of this type which means that if i really truly want to understand how we experience the world we have to really start recovering the fact that there is an integral entirement of self underworld that is basic to our being and modern philosophy with its rational approach this reflective second order experience splits the subject off from objects and from other subjects around us and so we end up with this subjectivism this world in which an intrinsically meaningless objective realm is called nature is somehow separated epistemically from isolated value bestowing self-certain subjects and so it needs to then be mastered through a more refined epistemological approaches but there is beneath all that as i said a primordial level of experience we are not denying here the reality of the subject object relation but rather pointing out that our experience of this subject of revelation derives from and so presupposes a more fundamental level of experience i'm not saying that we don't at some level are not aware that i'm a subject here and the world is an object out there but this is this awareness of my distinction from the world is a second order experience beneath it is a more fundamental more primordial level experience a kind of experience that i have more often than the reflective one and so the reflective experience of subject object distinction between myself and the world derives from this fundamental experience a primordial modality of engaged existence in which self and world are united rather than it when you walk through nature we're immediately connected to the very reality and beauty of nature itself i don't think about that connection i don't deduce it i don't uh arrive at it through some kind of calculated logical process the moment i step out of a car and start walking in nature i'm immediately connected i immediately start relaxing calming down i immediately feel the way in which the natural world around me realigns my existence and my reality in fact the less thought the less reflection the less thought conscious thinking the better because that allows that kind of connection to intensify and so we are aware in our day-to-day experiences that there is this more fundamental level of experience but we don't necessarily draw the logical conclusion from it or the natural conclusion from that and so looking at the world i may see the world as isolated objects but beneath that beneath that we know and experience the world of isolated objects as deeply interconnected this primordial level of experience in which the self and the world are united must be the starting point of any description of human experience that seeks to do justice to what such experience is really like it is prior to thought or reflection it is in a realm of experience we might refer to as feeling or the heart now let me explain what that means in a minute because i'm it might sound like i'm i'm suggesting something quite controversial modern thought has denigrated the heart as a faculty if you look on the left hand side you'll see that reason has been glorified since the enlightenment as a faculty of knowledge that grants us access to the world of truths that are objective it grants access to ideas that are clear understanding concepts that we can manipulate and through which we construct all sorts of different rational systems and eventually reason is what allows us to arrive at truth the heart has been denigrated the heart is considered the realm of subjective experience and when we say subjective experience even we today tend to speak of subjective experience as something that's unreliable when you say when someone speaks something in a conversation you may accuse them of being too subjective i.e um not uh rising to the level of an objective description of something um and therefore when you accuse them of being subjective you're really saying what telling them that what they're saying is inaccurate it's clouded by emotions that are unreliable it's clouded by feelings instead of clear understanding it's clouded by a mood a certain mood instead of a clear concept and the heart ultimately only gives a certain kind of experience but it doesn't allow us to achieve any degree of truth now this is a catastrophic distinction to elevate reason and denigrate the heart we know of course in our islamic psychospiritual model of the self that the heart is at the center of a unique type of perception and a unique type of knowledge that is precise and objective and we need to recover in the modern world the capacity of the heart in islamic cosmology the heart is a center of perceiving the divine reality ultimately of course and so our connection to the world is deeply felt it's deeply sensed it is real it is objective um and it's an objective relation between the ultimate nature of a living thing whether it's a living being or a living artifact and the ultimate nature of myself the inner self the eye the fetray itself and so if you look at the diagram on the right hand side whichever way you look at the diagram we cannot reduce the human being to just a body that senses things and a mind that thinks with through things if the body and the senses grant us access to the physical world and the mind grants us access to the world of ideas the heart grants us access to the spiritual reality of things each one of these each one of these is a faculty of knowledge within us and each one grants access to a different world and so if we consider the heart as nothing but a subjective faculty that grants access to only wishy-washy tree-hugging feelings then we're denying the heart it's intrinsic capacity in which the quran gives to it to perceive a divine reality we have to restore all three in balance with one another we may call this perception of our intrinsic connection to things fitratic perception or we may call it deep feeling but it's a it's a a knowledge deep within me that i have that i can't always deduce rationally but i know let's call it deep feeling i know it is real and it is true you may recall that in the islamic tradition the fitra is has it long an interesting history but one of the meanings of the fithra is it's that natural primordial disposition within us or nature within us that is able to acknowledge that there is a god and worship him and desires to worship him and at the same time it it's an intrinsic [Music] primordial nature that is inclined towards goodness so there is a sense in which in the islamic tradition um there we do possess a primordial nature and um but this primordial nature hints at and indicates to us certain truths that are precise and objective but don't fall into the category necessarily of a rational idea or something that we perceive with the eye and the ear for example we know the reality of allah in the future we are inclined and recognize the intrinsic beauty of nature through our fithra we are inclined towards goodness through our fitrah yes we develop elaborate ethical moral systems and philosophies to further refine the complex nature of reality or complex approach to reality but intrinsically our ethical moral systems are grounded in a fatheric predisposition towards goodness we deliver develop very elaborate schemes for producing beautiful poems and beautiful beauty in our man-made artifacts but this is ground in a fatheric inclination towards beauty um likewise and so we can and do possess this intrinsic inclination that can recognize um things objectively and truthfully so for example let me give you an example um no human being can be found anywhere in the world i think who can truthfully and honestly say that nature is ugly or repulsive now you will find some individuals who uh are averse to some natural phenomena like the sea or forest and what not and that's usually rooted in a trauma so someone may have had a traumatic experience swimming in the ocean or um it's quite common among uh people who have had traumatic experiences in nature to avoid uh forests and whatnot but that's secondary um and that's incidental or accidental it's it's a result of a particular trauma that happened to that individual but left to their own fitrah no person is inclined to dislike or a nature or find it ugly um likewise no human being is um uh unless there are certain circumstances that bar the development of the fifa uh or uh cover it over or distorted naturally we're inclined towards goodness and so the beauty of nature is something that we can objectively claim is true because everyone claims it's true so there is a degree of objectivity there but it's not the kind of objectivity of a rational proof necessarily for example it's a more of a fitrate objectivity and so in the same way that i trust my instinct in recognizing the beauty of nature well let's not call it instinct let's call it a perception in the same way that i trust this deep feeling or this deep fitratic perception of the beauty of nature likewise that same sensibility that same perception within me which is rooted in the heart of course or deep feeling um it can act as a guide towards the refinement of uh producing beautiful objects that's the same inclination that guides me towards moral goodness it's the same inclination that inclines me towards pursuing and finding the beauty in nature likewise that kind of same perception within us can guide us towards the production of beauty in in things and producing a kind of beauty that is objective we saw last week that there are two types of beauty subjective beauty and objective beauty objective beauty is the kind of beauty we find in nature and so and that is already deeply rooted within us and so if we listen to that deep fatra perception or this deep feeling we can be guided towards producing and recognizing beauty and ugliness in uh in a man-made world and here we're talking about the example of architecture for example so if we go back to this idea of reality being one we can speak of a psyche matter continuum that there's a continuum between my internal psyche my internal mind and matter or the space around me the divine names weave the fabric of existence everything is a manifestation of them and so therefore the traces of the divine names found in nature are also found within me and that creates a sympathetic bond between all things that are traces of divine means i'm connected to you and to the tree in some deep deep and profound sense we're not separate objects suspended in space but are rather to use a more spiritual term manifestations of a single reality space matter is not something out there and the mind psyche isn't something in here but rather the matter or psyche form a single continuum i'm also deeply connected to the buildings that surround me they are my habitat in the same way that when you look at this tree in all honesty one can gaze at this tree for hours and why is that the case that's because somehow the inner landscape of the soul and the outer landscape of the world mirror same reality i find myself in this tree in the sense that it's somehow in its structural form in its material in whatever it is i find a certain echo of a of a layer of my own self that i often not i'm not always aware of or at least not attentive to on a regular basis and so when i encounter the natural world around me i encounter let's say resonances of uh aspects of myself that i i have forgotten because of my afla uh my oblivious nature and so that's how the world acts as a reminder uh of the lost part of all the time we're up to our next drowning in the signs of god we don't always pay attention to it but they're in there they're there and everywhere and so in the same way that the natural world and myself are on a continuum likewise i'm deeply connected to everything around the including buildings and so those buildings better be designed in a way that reflect an image of myself that i aspire to actualize in life that i hope to realize my higher self in life better the buildings reflect that than reflect some kind of ugliness or whim or purely ego driven desire of a particular architect let them at buildings be extensions of the living quality we find in the natural world and so if we look at the street this street in the cotswold in england for example there's something about the material of the buildings the consistent height of the buildings uh the variation of the buildings but the simultaneous unity and coherence found the the age the buildings age grace something about the building that somehow in in many ways really reflects aspects of my existence that i miss so much there's almost a nostalgic feel about these places that they come from a level of uh reality or a realm of being that um we inspire we we we're inclined uh or aspire to inhabit more regularly these next two slides are from last week's presentations but i thought i'd repeat them here so when we look at these kind of natural objects or these street in the cotswold we get a sense in which they evince a deep feeling that somehow the image will reflect or an echo of that fitrah self we talked about earlier and so when the world around me reflects or when the landscape around me reflects my inner landscape of the soul something very interesting happens certain trains of meditation in the mind are triggered and that leaves profound effects within us transforms us and so these artifacts as it were as we said last week these uh buildings that possess this quality of life uh attained such an intensity of being that it almost feels like we're stepping beyond into a boundless world realm beyond the physical it's like we're gazing beyond the configuration of the physical qualities of the object itself they become nodes of light that shine brightest in the darkness of our existence or founts of a divine presence that cascades down through all of creation and so the act of building the act of designing is not something that is disconnected from who are from who i am crafting of space crafting of architecture crafting of object is simultaneously a process of crafting myself and it becomes the medium through which my inner self is realized actualized and discovered if the world and i are on a continuum if anything that is in the world affects me whether moves me positively or moves me in the opposite direction because there's no such thing as a neutral experience things in the world either enhance our happiness or increase a certain degree of anxiety everything in the world affects us of course remember our self is extensive uh or it's extended across the entire world like a bubble extended all the way out and so everything in the world affects us one way or another the moment you walk into a room the moment you walk into a building you're immediately affected affected by a certain kind of mood and so any intervention i make in the world around me is really an intervention in the self within me because it has an effect on me and so crafting of space therefore is a crafting of a particular kind of experience that the self encounters in practical terms this means that when i design a space i need to be aware of the degree in which it is alive the degree to which the space or the thing i'm making will enhance my own life remember gert has quote life enhancing quality last week and so through cultivating these things to design i'm in the process of really of cultivating and crafting myself anyone who's ever made something with their hand knows this experience but if you look at this courtyard for example uh in morocco you will see that there's a certain ambiance a certain atmospheric quality there's certain scentedness about it a certain stillness that deeply and profoundly affects me even through the picture um you remove the fountain and the entire atmospheric quality changes you remove the arches on the on the edges in the boundary and something changes it seems to have the right and most perfect type of proportions and openings on the side with a fountain in the middle to create a sense of or an image of perfection and image of stillness an image that deeply resonates within me and therefore the art of building a design is intrinsically and essentially a spiritual endeavor and as a gift or response to the sacred in life and the transcendental it was the hallmark of all building in the past and we urge you need to recover this remember if the world and myself exist on a continuum imagine this continuum like a lake anything i do in the world outside has ripple effects within me and that's a very profound thing to really think about in our modern age where we've inserted all sorts of ugliness in the cities around us we've suffocated the possibility of experiencing the sacred because we've created environments that rather than lead to god lead in the opposite direction entirely and so rather than the spaces around us being places that occasion and afford a deep and profound experience of god there are spaces in which we find ourselves having to experience god in spite of them and so this leader is a very very important idea when i look at an image like this this is beautiful my statement that this is beautiful is an objective value statement that the idea in modern culture that a value that an objective value statement like this is actually subjective is flawed someone might say i find this particular building beautiful someone else will say i find it ugly there are two value statements as long as the beauty is grounded in subjective criteria of the architect or designer then of course the value statements are purely subjective but if we ground our criteria of beauty in the objectivity of the patterned order ordered and harmonious principles found in nature then they can only be value statements that are objective and so value is a fundamental fact of the universe when i say this mountain and this lake is seen as absolutely beautiful i'm stating a fact a value statement about the universe that is truthful and so when it's asked how do you feel about a design in the architectural profession of course in design profession people say it's not something you want to ask because feeling has no role but as we said earlier in the heart there is this vitraic perception this deep feeling as it were that is is and can be an accurate guide for objective beauty if we choose to realign ourselves with it one of the biggest problems in design today is designers denying their own deep feeling and of course feelings are can be quite confusing sometimes there are sentiments and emotions and there are feelings sentiments and emotions uh can be are really surface or superficial emotional responses to certain situations that are usually rooted in subjective or whimsical or personal preferences uh feeling one can define feeling as it were or deep feeling as the heart's capacity to feel uh the truth of things but it's rooted in the fifa and that gives it an objectivity about it so if the fitrah deems something good and beautiful then it is good and beautiful if psyche matter constitute a single continuum if my inner reality and outer world constitute a single continuum then what i feel about it or the world around me reflects my own inner self response to that world and how i connect to it but i walk into a i i often do used to do this exercise with my architectural students we'd walk into a you know one of these modernist post-modern buildings concrete slabs and building look like it's falling down all sorts of different bizarre shapes i would ask the student how do you feel here and they would respond with all these interesting ideas about why the building's so brilliant and i would ask again don't tell me what you think about the building tell me how you feel in this space would you sit here with a coffee and a friend and have an intimate conversation and the response is always they'll go back to this kind of more cerebral rational uh response and say the one that is brilliant because of these ideas and so this kind of disconnect between the world of ideas where students are indoctrinated with a whole host of ideas about why certain kind of post-modernity buildings or modernist buildings are good and it's complete disconnect from the way they feel when you ask them how they feel they get confused how is that relevant it's deeply and profoundly irrelevant and all you have to do is really observe them many of them don't take their friends for a coffee and to sit in one of these buildings they actually usually end up going to some of the older buildings on campus or to enjoy and another test of this is it's very difficult to actually argue with people about these things but take someone into the natural world and speak to them about objective beauty and it might be a lot easier all you have to do is just let them soak it in i used to take many of my students on on trips to uh to to rome and fez and de lucia and other places and rather than have intellectual arguments about why post-modern architecture is wrong i'd let them soak in the atmospheric ambience of rome or venice or fez or granada and they would feel a connection they would feel things and have experiences they've never felt before that would really deeply and profoundly transform them and connect them with the level of their own existence that they never really were connected to so we are deeply connected to the world around us at a very fundamental and primordial sense and we feel the ripples on the surface of the vast ocean that is our existence however the feeling we're talking about here is not rooted in um ego but it's an egoless feeling it's rooted in the fithron so sentiments and emotions can be very personal driven by my own preferences my own tastes my own maybe psychological experiences these are often rooted in my own ego but beneath that there is an egoless feeling a fithrayek perception that guides in this process it's not the ego inflated superficial feeling of many contemporary artists or architects it's an egoless receptivity to the vibrations of the psyche matter the planar the the continuity between myself and the world it's located in the heart it's called the self let's call it the phithai itself and what follows on from from this is something quite interesting in the actual design process not only is um value objective but it allows us to start asking different kinds of questions for example when i want to build a building in a particular site as i said last week we either add something more beautiful to that natural site or leave it alone and the question to ask ourselves is not what kind of postmodern idea do i want to experiment with at this particular moment but rather survey the site develop a deep felt connection to the site and ask myself how can i increase the degree of life and beauty of this particular location and so the architect is the one who listens to things as it were and responds to an objective need right there at that particular point that region of space it is the existing built environment that hints to the designer what needs to be done and if we align ourselves with this these kind of questions we're asking ourselves the same kind of questions that are intrinsic in the natural world although the mushrooms on the right hand side don't ask these questions consciously of course they are nonetheless driven by a fitra a pattern of behavior that's intrinsic to their nature that was my father has given to them and they grow out of the trunk of that tree in a way that responds immediately to the parameters the constraints of that particular location the same way that the buildings on the left mushroom out of the edge of that cliff following a similar logic it's almost as if if nature were to sprout out a number of buildings that would look something quite similar to these particular buildings here you see it's a monastery in bhutan not only is value objective it's also enduring this is a very very crucial point the modern process is that an architect comes into a site and erects a structure but is out of context because it's driven by an ego desire to express himself or herself but the traditional architect the egoless architect did not find a building an opportunity for self-expression but rather an opportunity to express what is to express values that are objective to express order harmony and beauty that all can agree on it's not an egoless and lacks the spiritual discipline of what edmund bacon calls this principle the second man if you look at the image on the right hand side it's a it's a traditional street in ancient rome the principle of the traditional of the second man is a very interesting one it suggests that if you look at the buildings each one of those buildings there was erected in a slightly different period and despite the centuries separating the various buildings from one another they seem to have a coherence about them they seem to fit together with one another whether it's the consistency of the height of the buildings or the fenestration the window proportions or whether it's the variations from the lower to upper part of the buildings uh there's a enough diversity to create some interest but at the same time enough unity to create a coherence but these were designed over centuries why is it that over several centuries a street managed to mold itself or form with this degree of harmony well if the second man principle or the principle of the second man it's the idea that because these people over several centuries shared the same fundamental vision and values on beauty goodness coherence and harmony or principles of beauty rooted in the natural order the objective order of things no matter no matter the centuries separating them the principles were the same of course there's a slight variation in style of course between this and ancient rome for example but even later medieval buildings that were added into uh ancient rome still have a consistency with that ancient roman city even with the christian era and post-christian era and that is because they all uh subscribe to those same fundamental values of deriving the principles of beauty from the objective order of nature this is nothing but the what we call in islam the golden principle of the sincere or chain of transmission chain of transmission in islam is when or the sisla is when one scholar student of knowledge learns from a older student of a teacher or scholar and they derive the wisdom and principles from that sincerely itself the grace of tradition is what grants every individual in this allah a certain wisdom and a certain set of principles that transcend their own egos and transcend their own limitations so when we inscribe ourselves within a goal within a sincere we're really inscribing ourselves within a chain of people who share a certain set of values a certain set of principles and that's what allows the creation of order and harmony that is enduring over centuries and centuries and centuries if every student did something radical if every architect who came after the next architect did something radical no city would be as coherent as this one and if every student of knowledge came and did something radically different from their master there would know there would be no continuity of knowledge through the centuries in a chain of transmission all egos are subdued or submit to the grace and wisdom of tradition only the fitratic self is called into action when one submits one ego to the grace of tradition and the principles and wisdoms handed down through tradition a certain coherence is created over time over a long period of time like the coherence defined in many ancient cities and towns and what is called interaction is not the temporal ego self of the individual that's bound to the particular circumstances of the whims and desires of that particular individual but rather what is opened up what is called into action what is activated in this process is the fetray itself and it's turned towards the absolute and eternal principles of beauty and order and so what we really need what we urge that in need is um to restore and recover the our traditional cosmology which with um the kind of requirements of our modern age will be both a traditional and new cosmology at the same time and in architectural language we say it's to give the future um the gift we need to give a future to the past we need to give the future uh to the past the but the past and its values are not dead um they are extremely relevant in our modern age um the question is how can we re-articulate in a language that we can understand today so this ends the formal uh part one of this presentation last week was was half and this this is the other half in the next uh two or three weeks insha'allah i'll continue what i promised to do last week and that is to turn towards the material cause the formal cause and the efficient cause of architecture we already discussed the final cause in the first lecture last week in childhood so right now what i'm going to do is i'm going to turn to q a i'm going to stop sharing and bring up hopefully the list of questions that have been building up hopefully throughout this session okay i don't seem to see any new questions okay i'm not sure if i can uh i'm able to see the uh the questions um okay here we are so um in your second lecture you speak of natural realities and message realities how do we comprehend in a holistic manner any artificial realities that we seek to design oh uh how do we comprehend a holistic manner that's an interesting question um i'm still divided or um i'm still discovering myself the nature of ai and virtual realities um i i do i i am inclined to think that any experiences that leave our bodily existence behind can be extremely dangerous to our capacity to perceive things naturally we are at the end of the day beings that are embodied with the body mind and soul and so our most fundamental natural experiences are one that are rooted in this reality in our body when we escape from the body into the realm of uh artificial images there is a there is a deep and profound danger there and uh to be honest with you we're still discovering the full implications of what that actually entails so i can't really give you a full answer right now but i'll i'll definitely try to think about it and try to give us some kind of uh major response by next week inshallah the idea of things being deeply connected reminds of the analogy about madonna of reality constructed like a rug um is there any such anything explicit in the quran hadith literature that speaks of the interconnectedness of things well the um one of the interesting things about um about these types of question that i find is we live in an age in which so much of what was implicitly understood in the past has to be explicitly articulated and in an age before our modern period for example where it was almost unthinkable to destroy nature you won't find many a lot of literature on necessarily the preservation of nature um in the sense that we we understand it today um or in a world in which uh in the previous one the pre-modern age in a world in which atheists didn't really exist in large numbers or they existed only in individuals there wasn't a culture of atheism it's very difficult to find in pre-modern literature including islamic literature a lot of stuff that can address the challenges and problems of atheism today and so what i'm getting at is that so many today we we search for connectedness to nature because we've become so radically disconnected this has never happened in human history before and so although the quran does not explicitly talk and say you are intimately interconnected with everything in nature it didn't need to because implicitly this is something that was never questioned before the modern age uh never questioned at all however having said that though every single uh quranic verse and the very idea of reality uh consisting or the nature of reality consisting of divine names etc suggests of course that this internet interconnected exists the very idea of taheed is uh is suggests interconnectedness uh many thinkers uh whether it's philosophers or atufis are not inventing things uh necessarily uh that are new that they're drawing out consequences and implications of uh their understanding of taheed in more more and more detailed form and sometimes drawing out the implications for an age that meets it so today for example we do need um let's say a theology of the built environment and we need the theology of nature we didn't do this before the modern age why because we didn't need a theology of the natural world because we weren't at odds with it and we didn't need a theology of the built environment because we weren't producing the kind of ugliness that we see in the modern world and therefore we weren't producing generating the kind of problems that are associated with ugly cities and monstrous cities et cetera et cetera so we've got to be really careful about these issues and questions because um you often hear some muslims say if it hasn't been explicitly mentioned in the quran then it's but it's not entirely the case at all um i completely disagree with that with that with that kind of um understandings what is the basic contribution of islamic values and principles to the architecture beyond period and urban planning in general to support good livelihood and functionality i don't think i understand the question in terms of recommendations i will suggest recommendations there is one i i i'm gonna link i'm gonna link what i've been saying in the next two talk two three talks to individual authors and architects there are a few uh brilliant minds out there uh writing so i will do that in the next week or so when the topics actually come up and arise in sha allah um i think that's all of it for today i don't see any more questions inshaallah if there are any other questions um inshallah we can address them as we did this week address them at the end of uh session next week in china when we talk about the materiality of architecture or the very material in which we use to build things and make you\n\n\nWhat are his sustainable reconstruction and retrofitting

Food prices increased due to a drought linked to climate change. \n\nPeer discussions:\nWhat are the main challenges Iraq faces due to climate change?\nSource: https://kapita.iq/storage/app/media/New%20Research%20Publications/Climate%20Change%20Overview.pdf \n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nThe impact of climate change, particularly in causing droughts and increased desertification, has become increasingly evident in recent years in Iraq and Syria, which together form the two limbs of what is known as the \"Fertile Crescent.”\nA direct consequence of the increased aridity, which is strongly felt, is the occurrence of sandstorms. According to the United Nations report, it indicates that the Iraqi Ministry of Environment has recorded 122 dust storms and 283 dusty days in 2012 and it estimates that this will increase to 300 dusty days per year in the next ten years. \nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nBy the end of this century, the \"Fertile Crescent\" could lose its current shape and might even disappear altogether. The area shown in the picture experienced one of the most devastating droughts in decades during 2007-2008, which scientists have linked to climate change. This severe drought affected much of Syria and northern Iraq during what is typically the wettest time of the year.\nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nDesertification, Drought, and Sand Storms\nDust storms have increased by 10x over the since the 1990s.\nDust storms have resulted in the closure of airports and hospitalizations  resulting from dust-induced respiratory illnesses.\nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nWater Scarcities\nWater withdrawals in riparian countries, particularly Turkey, Iran, and to a lesser extent Syria, are increasing due to rising demand. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources, future projections under climate change indicate worsening conditions for the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Studies suggest the Euphrates-Tigris discharge could decline by 9.5% between 2040 and 2069, with some estimates predicting up to a 73% reduction in the Euphrates River's annual flow.\nSource: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1199705/FULLTEXT01.pdf \n\nMajor Climate Change Issues in Iraq\nSea Level Rise (SLR)\nThe rise in sea levels due to climate change is likely to impact many coastal areas and inundate low-lying regions. The most concerning area is the Basrah Governorate, which includes seven districts.\nReduced river flow, combined with rising sea levels, has led to higher salinity in the rivers, harming agriculture, livestock, and the people who depend on them.\nSeawater has reached as far as 189 kilometers upstream from the Persian Gulf, destroying 24,000 hectares of agricultural land and 30,000 trees.\nWithout fresh water to dilute them, pollutants from agriculture, the oil and gas industry, and sewage have become more concentrated.\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349103014_The_Impacts_of_Sea_Level_Rise_on_Basrah_City_Iraq \n\nSource: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349103014_The_Impacts_of_Sea_Level_Rise_on_Basrah_City_Iraq \nhttps://e360.yale.edu/features/iraq-marshes-drought-climate-change \n\nPortion of the original population displaced due to environmental factors.
