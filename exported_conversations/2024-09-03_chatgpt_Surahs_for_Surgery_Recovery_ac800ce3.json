      "content": "When someone is going through surgery, it is common in Islamic tradition to recite specific surahs (chapters) from the Quran to seek protection, healing, and comfort. Some of the most commonly recited surahs include:\n\n1. **Surah Al-Fatiha (Chapter 1)** - Often referred to as the \"Opening,\" this surah is considered one of the most important in the Quran and is recited for all sorts of blessings and protection.\n\n2. **Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112)** - Reciting this surah is believed to bring immense rewards and serves as a declaration of the oneness of Allah, offering spiritual comfort.\n\n3. **Surah Al-Falaq (Chapter 113)** and **Surah An-Naas (Chapter 114)** - These surahs are often recited for protection against harm, including physical ailments and psychological stress.\n\n4. **Surah Ya-Sin (Chapter 36)** - Known as the \"heart of the Quran,\" Surah Ya-Sin is frequently recited for seeking ease and protection during difficult times, including surgery.\n\nAdditionally, making dua (supplication) for the person’s safety and recovery is encouraged. You may recite the following prayer:\n\n- **Dua for Healing**: \"Allahumma rabban-naas, adhhibi al-ba'sa, washfi anta ash-shaafi, laa shifaa'a illa shifa'uka, shifaa'an laa yughaadiru saqaman.\"\n  - Translation: \"O Allah, Lord of mankind, remove the harm and heal, You are the Healer. There is no healing except Your healing, a healing that leaves no illness.\"\n\nReciting these surahs and duas with sincerity can offer spiritual comfort and protection for the person undergoing surgery.",
