Here's the revised bio with a focus on AI and LLMs in education:\n\n---\n\n**Bio: Bilal Ghalib**\n\nBilal Ghalib is the co-founder and Head of Research at Bloom, with over 15 years of experience in social enterprises and organizations in the USA and MENA regions. He holds a Master's degree from the Universite de Paris in Interdisciplinary Approaches to Research and Education. Since 2017, Bilal has been working with AI as a developer, and since March 2023, he has been running trainings on AI, focusing on its application in education. His work at Bloom centers on creating community-oriented, online learning environments that support personalized, self-paced learning and inquiry-based education for marginalized communities, with a particular focus on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nA recognized leader in educational innovation and community engagement, Bilal has facilitated numerous workshops and talks, empowering entrepreneurs and learners across Lebanon and the Middle East. His dedication to wellbeing in the workplace earned him the Compassionate Leaders Fellowship USA/India with H.H. The Dalai Lama from 2019-2022. Bilal’s vision aligns with UNESCO's mission to ensure quality education for all, promoting inclusive and sustainable learning opportunities through the integration of AI and LLMs in education.\n\n---\n\nThis version highlights your expertise in AI and LLMs and their application in creating inclusive and personalized educational environments.",

I will present a theory of ethic and provide a philosophical underpinning as to why mindfulness and meditation are co-factors alongside an ecological worldview. My presentation will demonstrate biomimetic technological factors within LLMs that act as affordances offering us leverage to gain the wisdom of those who have walked our path before us. How do we short cut the \"elite college->elite consulting group->green non-profit\" pipeline? I believe there needs to be white papers and recommendations to alter the reinforement learning component of the LLM producers, and otherwise establish LLM interfaces which include a system prompt designed with the 7 affordances in mind, promoting metacognition, goal reappraisal, and potentially bringing about an inner revolution and a greener world. \"\n\nFor this:\n\nDigital Learning Week 2024 will be organized at UNESCO Headquarters from 2 to 5 September 2024. The concept note is available online for your reference.\n\nRecognized as one of the “UN Intergovernmental and Multi-Stakeholder Digital Cooperation Bodies and Forums”,this annual event convenes the community of digital education leaders, policy-makers, researchers and practitioners from various organizations, including UN agencies, governments, NGOs, academia and the private sector.\n\nDigital Learning Week 2024 aims to promote multi-stakeholder cooperation towards a human-centred and green design and use of AI in education, with a specific focus on exploring the interlinkages between digital transformation and greening education.\n\nTo surface best practices and facilitate knowledge sharing on the intersection of digital and green transformations, UNESCO is currently selecting presentations through a call for proposals. A separate call for presentations on the theme of AI and education is available here.\n\nSelected presenters will have the unique opportunity to address a global audience comprising policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, private sector partners and development agencies.\n\nPlease note that UNESCO mainly seeks proposals pertaining to practices that have been implemented at scale, which means that conceptual ideas without practical implementation are not preferable.\n\nThe form below requests a narrative description of your presentations while personal information such as email addresses will not be shared. If your presentation is selected for inclusion in the programme, the description you provide will be used directly on the UNESCO website and other communication materials. Please allow yourself sufficient time to complete the required fields and ensure clarity and readability of the text. Only proposals in English or French will be considered.\n\nPresentation proposals must be submitted to UNESCO no later than 5 June 2024. Selected proposals will be notified by 28 June 2024.\n\nPlease note that only selected submissions will be notified via email.\n\nEach participant will be responsible for their own travel and accommodations to Digital Learning Week.\n\n* Greening education is a communication term used to describe a holistic approach to education’s response to the climate crisis as demanded by young people. Greening education empowers learners with the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to engage in transformative action on mitigation, adaptation and resilience to climate change, with the aim of shaping green, low emission climate-resilient societies.\n\nGreen technologies, also known as sustainable or eco-friendly technologies, are innovations aimed at reducing negative environmental impacts and promoting sustainability. These technologies are designed to minimize resource consumption, decrease pollution, and mitigate climate change (green design).\n",
