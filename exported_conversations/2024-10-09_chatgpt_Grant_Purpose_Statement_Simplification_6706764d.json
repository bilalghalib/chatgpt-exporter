The phrasing is direct and practical.\n- **Cons**: Could be slightly more explicit about Bloom’s ongoing role.\n\n### 3. \"This grant will allow Bloom to run a training-of-trainers program in partnership with Dream of Detroit, through which they will learn and directly apply skills by delivering custom, tech-enabled entrepreneurship programs to up to 20 entrepreneurs.\"\n- **Pros**: The phrase \"directly apply skills\" reinforces the practical element of the TOT.\n- **Cons**: \"Directly apply skills\" is solid, but the overall sentence feels a bit long.\n\n### New Version (taking elements from #2 with improvements):\n\"This grant will enable Bloom to deliver a hands-on training-of-trainers program to Dream of Detroit in Southeastern Michigan, where they will learn and immediately apply skills by running custom, tech-enabled entrepreneurship programs for up to 20 entrepreneurs, with Bloom’s ongoing support.\"\n\n- **Pros**: Combines the best of all options: hands-on learning, immediate application, clear role of Dream of Detroit, and Bloom’s ongoing support, making the program’s structure clear and direct.",

Let’s dig into the core of what your training-of-trainers program is really about.\n\nAt its essence, you're building capacity within communities by transferring skills that allow local organizations to empower entrepreneurs. This is about **creating self-sustaining systems** where organizations can independently run programs that directly impact the people they serve. It’s not just about digital access or diversity, but about fostering **agency, independence, and real economic empowerment**.\n\nHere are five ways to reflect that:\n\n1. **\"Create sustainable pathways for local organizations to empower entrepreneurs and build stronger, self-reliant communities.\"**\n   - Focuses on sustainability and community-driven empowerment.\n\n2. **\"Foster local economic independence by equipping organizations to deliver high-quality entrepreneurship training that scales beyond this program.\"**\n   - Highlights economic independence and the long-term impact of the training.\n\n3. **\"Build the capacity for local organizations to empower their communities through entrepreneurship, creating a ripple effect of opportunity and growth.\"**\n   - Emphasizes the lasting impact and the ripple effect of the training.\n\n4. **\"Empower communities to take control of their economic futures by enabling organizations to deliver entrepreneurship programs that create real, lasting change.\"**\n   - Centers on economic empowerment and long-term community-driven change.\n\n5. **\"Equip local organizations with the tools to foster self-reliance, helping entrepreneurs thrive and creating sustainable opportunities for growth.\"**\n   - Focuses on self-reliance and the ripple effect for entrepreneurs.\n\n### Top 2 Choices:\n- **\"Create sustainable pathways for local organizations to empower entrepreneurs and build stronger, self-reliant communities.\"**\n  - This highlights the deeper impact of creating sustainability and local empowerment.\n\n- **\"Foster local economic independence by equipping organizations to deliver high-quality entrepreneurship training that scales beyond this program.\"**\n  - Focuses on economic independence and scalability, which is a real, tangible benefit.\n\n### Updated Proposal Sentence:\n1. \"This grant will create sustainable pathways for local organizations to empower entrepreneurs and build stronger, self-reliant communities, benefiting up to 20 entrepreneurs.\"\n\n2. \"This grant will foster local economic independence by equipping organizations to deliver high-quality entrepreneurship training that scales beyond this program, benefiting up to 20 entrepreneurs.\"\n\nThese versions reflect the deeper, more meaningful benefits of your program, focusing on the core impact rather than just echoing the foundation's goals.",
