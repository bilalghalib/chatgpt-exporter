      "content": "Clean up and summarize and shorten this voice note: Hey assalamu’alaikum. Good morning Angela. So I am back in France. I went to America to visit family. That was weird.\n\nBut now I'm back and I'm going to go to the Change Now conference and I know we are going to be Co running and Co designing and Co ING a accelerator soon for nonprofits. And I'm really excited about that. And I will be at this conference of 40,000 “UN” change makers and change maker organizations from around the world. And I've made some Flyers I'm going to be passing out.\n\nI can share those with you, but also I realized that I probably should have shared with you the flyers as they were in production because you might have some ideas about how to make them most helpful and meaningful. And maybe if you're interested, you could even check out, I can give you the login, but I think it's also public information, the people that are going to be there and the people that you think that I should reach out to more personally and more directly. This is besides the fact that I really would love to talk with you about the actual strategy and potentially bringing in some of the insights from my essay that are the background behind why I'm developing this thing called Come Alive and how it could potentially be a part of the accelerator. So yeah, I'd love to talk about two things, marketing, I guess, and how to make best use of my time at this conference that will be going on for three days. So today, tomorrow, the day after and I guess we have some things scheduled, but soon I'd love to chat with you about the design and philosophy and the programmatic site as well. OK, salaam.",

Here's a cleaned-up, shortened summary of your voice note:\n\n---\n\n**Hi Angela, salaam and good morning.**  \nI'm back in France after visiting family in the U.S.—it was a bit strange. I'm heading to the ChangeNOW conference, where I'll be among 40,000 changemakers and organizations. I've made some flyers to share there and would love your thoughts on how to make them more effective—wish I'd shared them earlier for your input.\n\nSince we're co-designing an accelerator for nonprofits soon, I’d also love your help identifying people at the conference I should personally connect with. I can share the attendee list and even give you login access if you’re interested.\n\nBeyond that, I’d love to talk about two things:\n1. **Marketing and how to make the most of this 3-day event**, and  \n2. **The strategy and deeper philosophy behind the \"Come Alive\" concept**, and how it might fit into the accelerator.\n\nLet’s connect soon on all this.  \n**Salaam!**\n\n---\n\nWould you like this version sent as a message or email draft?",
