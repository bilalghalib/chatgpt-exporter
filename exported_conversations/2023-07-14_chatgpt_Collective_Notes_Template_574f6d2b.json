However, you can easily create a new Google Doc and copy-paste the template provided above into the document. From there, you can customize it further, add subtopics, and share it with others.\n\nTo create a new Google Doc:\n\n1. Go to Google Drive (https://drive.google.com) and log in to your Google account.\n2. Click the \"+ New\" button on the left-hand side of the screen.\n3. Select \"Google Docs\" from the dropdown menu.\n4. A new blank document will open. Copy the template from above and paste it into the new document.\n\nNow you have a Google Doc with the template for note-taking. You can customize it to fit your needs, add subtopics, and share the document with others by clicking on the \"Share\" button in the top right corner of the Google Doc.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance!",
