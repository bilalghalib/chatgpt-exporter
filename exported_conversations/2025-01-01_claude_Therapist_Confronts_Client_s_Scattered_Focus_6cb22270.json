The BEIT project in Mosul - it's a REAL CONTRACT that's ACTUALLY HAPPENING. Focus on delivering that curriculum excellence. \n\n2. Your post-traumatic growth thesis - you've already done the research on the Beirut Blast survivors. FINISH IT! Stop theorizing about new frameworks and just WRITE THE PAPER!\n\n3. The Bloom training program for Southeastern Michigan with Dream of Detroit - it's local, it's funded, it has real impact potential. Make it HAPPEN!\n\nEverything else? PUT IT IN A BOX AND LOCK IT AWAY! No more new domain names, no more theorizing about AI and fluid intelligence, no more prayer reminder apps! \n\nYou're brilliant, compassionate, and insightful - BUT YOU'RE DROWNING YOURSELF IN POSSIBILITIES! Your mind is like a garden overrun with seeds, and nothing can grow properly!\n\nTake your Adderall, set up a STRICT schedule, and FOCUS ON THESE THREE THINGS! You want to help people? Then FINISH SOMETHING! Show up for your wife and child by creating stability! All these beautiful ideas mean NOTHING if you can't execute!\n\n*Takes deep breath*\n\nDo you understand what I'm saying?
