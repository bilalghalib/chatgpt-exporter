      "content": "You're likely thinking of **Antony Flew**, a British philosopher who was a prominent atheist for much of his life and then publicly changed his position in his later years.\n\n### Key facts about Antony Flew:\n- **Born**: February 11, 1923  \n- **Died**: April 8, 2010 (aged 87)  \n- **Known for**: Being a leading atheist philosopher in the 20th century  \n- **Changed view**: In 2004, at around age 81, he announced that he had come to believe in the existence of a **deistic god** (not a personal God, but a creator), based on arguments from **intelligent design** and **fine-tuning** of the universe.  \n- **Book**: *There Is a God: How the World’s Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind* (2007)\n\n### About his wife:\n- There's little public information about Flew's wife, and she did not play a central role in his public conversion.\n- Your memory may be blending elements of his late-life conversion with a fictional or less well-known personal story involving grief and belief.\n\nIf you're thinking of someone **specifically moved by the death of a spouse**, it might not be Flew. There could be another figure, possibly in a documentary, memoir, or religious testimony, who fits your description more precisely.\n\nWould you like help identifying similar stories or figures who turned to belief after a spouse’s death in old age?",
