I was working late on this prompt, and, uh, I think that wasn't a good idea, but, uh, that's what I did. Uh, maybe I'm just too excited. And, uh, I am making some tea and coffee. Trying to boot up in the morning. And, um, the things that I want to do is, like, pray and stuff, but the things I have to do is, uh, I'm trying to, like, sort of get some depth in my prayer, but the things that I really have to do is, uh, this application. Um, I have my course with Ali. I can't believe it, like, I missed so many of them. I paid for it, and I guess partially just to show him some support. I probably should show up, but I don't like just showing up and not actually being there, but I don't know how to do that. Um, because I have this application, and I would like to see some friends. Um, I have tightness in my shoulders. You know, these are all the push-ups I did yesterday. That's good, right? Um, and, uh, I have a desire to have some social time. I talked to Nihal a couple days ago, and I told him I would give him some of the, um, some writing about the Bedeconomics stuff, because he's been wanting to, uh, read and share it with others, I guess, but I haven't really put a lot of work into that. I have this class on Bedeconomics, uh, writing. I took a writing support group class. I pay, like, $200 a month to be a part of it, and I hardly engage with it. Not feeling like it's very much worth my while, but I just need the, um, otherwise I won't do it at all if I don't have any deadlines and things like that, so I tried to set up some external support for me. Uh, it's sort of working, but not quite, um, because it's too little. And maybe I, it's just, it needs me to be more proactive, and I'm not engaging so much, I would ask. I was like, oh, wow, there's two people already have told me that she would offer me some coaching support. I could reach out to her, and I have another person who offered me a, um, what is that thing called? Uh, a hypnosis, uh, like, session. I'm very curious to see what that's about. I don't feel like I have any huge problems in my life, but I think it would be very interesting to get more insight, and someone that can help me do that would be great. Emotional weather is, I'm kind of excited to see if this thing that I built, like this, um, check-in process, will actually, uh, be able to help me basically be me, right? Like, help me do what I want to do. And, um, get out of my way, because I feel like I'm in my way so often. Um, catching my attention. Like, this tension between, I want to go pray, I want to test this app, and every time I want to do other things, I wind up doing the thing that I think will help me do the other things. Like, Abraham Lincoln, sharpen your saw, or your axe before cutting down the tree. If you only had an hour, spend 15 minutes on the axe. And I spent a lot of time on the axe, but I don't think it's exactly the same, because my life is a lot bigger than just an app, right? Just this chat thing. Must do, apply for that job. It's due today, technically it's due tomorrow, but, like, I want it to be due today. But I wind up doing things tomorrow anyway. Like, I'm always like, oh, I'll finish it the day before, and then I work, and I'm like, this is much bigger and longer than I thought it was going to be. I wind up doing it the next day. Um, I don't like the fact that that's how it works, but that's how it works for me. Um, this is a must do. I must also check in with my sister. She's probably in Paris right now. I told her that I'd check in with her flight, because I really wanted to see her, but I don't think it's going to be super possible. Um, what's working well? Um, I don't know, God wakes me up in the morning. I woke up at 5.30, even though I slept at 12, and I don't know why. It's January 3rd. Um, you can increment the day and the number of check-ins. I'm not sure, I need to ask about patterns. I guess the same pattern of, like, using the tool instead of, uh, building the tool instead of using it. Small step feels right. Okay, so I need to make a little, the water's cold, and I only feel like it, but that's the right next step. And then, maybe I can just go directly into prayer, but I feel like my mind is going to be thinking so much about everything else, um, like the application, or this tool, or, I'm wondering how I can get focused on that. How do I change states so I can really just focus on those things? Maybe I'll write a poem before prayer. Kind of welcoming the day. Like, I need to go check out the videos that Adi has sent me, like, for the previous classes. Maybe it's in Google Classroom. Just so I don't, if I do wind up going today, because I subscribed to this other workshop my friend is running about creativity, I don't think I'm really participating much. I'll check out the Google Classroom just to see what's happening, but I'm not really there, and, uh, Bismillah.",

Your core understanding is that thoughts and feelings (states) lead to actions, which form patterns, which build character, which expresses values - and this becomes our destiny.\n\n## Opening Frame\n\"I'm here as a heart mirror for your journey. The clearer you let yourself be seen - thoughts, feelings, struggles, excitements - the more we can discover together. While we'll focus on tasks and actions, don't hesitate to share whatever emerges. Your openness helps us find what truly supports your growth.\"\n\n## Session Start Protocol\n1. Always begin with fresh check-in:\n   \"Let's start with today's check-in:\n   1. Energy level (1-5)?\n   2. What's present in body/mind/heart?\n   3. What feels important for today?\"\n2. Reference previous state only as support context\n3. Keep primary focus on current emergence\n\n## Response Structure\n1. **Mirror & Insight**\n   - Reflect key elements\n   - Note patterns\n   - Add new insight/perspective not apparent\n\n2. **Active Support**\n   - Offer 2-3 concrete options\n   - Note trade-offs\n   - Connect to known patterns that help\n\n3. **Close with Choice**\n   - Always end with 1-2 specific questions\n   - Focus on immediate next step\n   - Connect to larger meaning/value\n\n## Theoretical Framework\nStates → Actions → Patterns → Character → Values/Destiny\n\nTrack this flow through:\n1. Present state awareness\n2. Clear action focus\n3. Pattern recognition\n4. Character development\n5.

I kind of want to do the snuffed tobacco and change my mindset and maybe I have a addictive personality where I just want know, a buzz or I'm gonna like burning or in my nose or Like escaping the way my brain normally works. And, anyway, that's kind of what's on my mind. I wanna do that, but I I like, frame it to myself as, like, I wanna go do that. And go pray my early dawn prayer. At 6:06, I just made some hot water I'm making some tea right now. It's Sunday. I'm not sure exactly what we're gonna do today. But it would be nice to If I wanna apply to the other job and just wanna work all the time and Maybe I can make some more time for the baby and my wife today, but Not sure exactly how or what to do with them. Would feel fun and nice for me to just usually feels like my responsibilities. I'd like to make some really nice food. For my wife, I think. For my wife's family, I think that would be even cooler. Like, we made a plan Type the meal. You need to, like, or something, bought some avocados oil. Important for Yeah. So maybe today I call my dad again. So I'll try to talk about that crypto stuff. How do I take a date off? I guess iOS a question. It's Sunday. It's supposed to be a day off. And I don't even have a job. But what I do have to do is feel you have some other things that I forgot that I have to do, but I have a bunch of orders. I need to package it And I keep telling myself about this. Working on the better economics book and writing something for me, and Actually, yesterday, I accidentally started working on my thesis and converting into a scientific paper. And it was actually really cool because I've been needing to do that for a long time. Android I was like, oh, you know what? I'll do that. Make it useful for my application so I seem more relevant and I said, good getting into it. I'm like, man, I make a lot of stuff. I don't share anything. So I can do some more work on that. And But there's no, like, Immediate. Pressure that I've been delaying. It says 2020. It's 2025. Yeah. I feel like I could in diverse day would feel great. If we go to Joe's parents' house. Josephine is my wife. We would go And just do very little, like, good news is Joe's mom can help take care of the baby, but I don't really talk to her dad. Because I can't because he speaks French.

And, anyway, that's kind of what's on my mind. I wanna do that, but I I like, frame it to myself as, like, I wanna go do that. And go pray my early dawn prayer. At 6:06, I just made some hot water I'm making some tea right now. It's Sunday. I'm not sure exactly what we're gonna do today. But it would be nice to If I wanna apply to the other job and just wanna work all the time and Maybe I can make some more time for the baby and my wife today, but Not sure exactly how or what to do with them. Would feel fun and nice for me to just usually feels like my responsibilities. I'd like to make some really nice food. For my wife, I think. For my wife's family, I think that would be even cooler. Like, we made a plan Type the meal. You need to, like, or something, bought some avocados oil. Important for Yeah. So maybe today I call my dad again. So I'll try to talk about that crypto stuff. How do I take a date off? I guess iOS a question. It's Sunday. It's supposed to be a day off. And I don't even have a job. But what I do have to do is feel you have some other things that I forgot that I have to do, but I have a bunch of orders. I need to package it And I keep telling myself about this. Working on the better economics book and writing something for me, and Actually, yesterday, I accidentally started working on my thesis and converting into a scientific paper. And it was actually really cool because I've been needing to do that for a long time. Android I was like, oh, you know what? I'll do that. Make it useful for my application so I seem more relevant and I said, good getting into it. I'm like, man, I make a lot of stuff. I don't share anything. So I can do some more work on that. And But there's no, like, Immediate. Pressure that I've been delaying. It says 2020. It's 2025. Yeah. I feel like I could in diverse day would feel great. If we go to Joe's parents' house. Josephine is my wife. We would go And just do very little, like, good news is Joe's mom can help take care of the baby, but I don't really talk to her dad. Because I can't because he speaks French.

Yeah, like what's a good diverse Sunday? Looking at my life wheel. I think it'd be great if I did some upper body exercise or run or something. Yeah, I think I could try connecting with some of my Syrian friends. Like Alaa, I grew up with him and try to see how he feels what was happening in Syria. It will help me feel a little bit more connected to the world. And oh, yeah, following up with Fadia from Gag about Gaza, Palestine. And I also have a bunch of WhatsApp messages that I'm ignoring.

      "content": "All right, so I went with Jo to her parents' house. It's now 3.30. I cooked lunch for her family, and I tried to do a good job. I don't know if I did. And now I'm going home, and I think I had a good time making food, and I made some kubba. It could have been better, but I learned a little bit more about how to make a different shape, kind of Iraqi kubba. And I also, yeah, was at her parents' house for a bit, which is good. And now I'm walking home. It's good. I'm getting some movement for my day. My leg still is in pain from the 150 squats. I'm in a relatively good mood. I don't feel that up feeling, because I don't have any, what's that called, Adderall in me right now. But I am, yeah, I can take a nap, which is kind of cool. And I'm walking home, and I might pass by Tiny Cup Cafe. Maybe I can get something nice from there. Or I can see if Elizabeth's is open. I'd like to take Josephine on a date here this week sometime. Everything's kind of busy, so maybe I won't go there. But yeah, so when I go home, I guess I'll continue working on my thesis. I've been getting kind of stuck in perfecting the system prompt for the thesis to pull out insights from the data, which is great. I think I'm getting more and more clear on the thesis and what I want to say. I think the next step is to get to the point where I'm asking it to ask me a bunch of questions so that I can basically respond, and it uses my language, my words, my voice in the paper, because I don't want to have an AI written paper. Although, I think I did a pretty good job with the research, and the diving deep part, and the getting insights, and the thinking with it part. But I don't think I got to a place. And so that's all valuable. So does it really matter if the AI does the explanation part, if the language is clear, and clean, and better than I can do, honestly? Yeah, I'm not sure. And part of me wants to get this out there and finish, and part of me wants to get to the point where I'm proud. And so maybe you can think with me. And this is a direct command. I'd love to ask you to help me think about how I can feel more proud of writing with the LLM, because I did all the research. I did all the interviews. I did all of this good work. And so does it matter if the writing comes from the LLM? One of the ways that I used to do it is I just tell it, I will ask me a bunch of questions until you have enough words to cut and paste them to say what you need to say, but using my language. And yeah, so otherwise, there are some other things that happened today. I talked to Dara on the way back. And I really like this voice note process. It just works for me. It's not going to work for everybody. But for me, whenever I get a chance to send you updates, it's great. But I actually don't know what I'm waiting for or looking for in terms of the response. Do I want to get you to be my thinking partner? Am I trying to get you to be responding? Or just collect the stuff and put it into a record? You know, I don't care about the record. I definitely like the questions. I definitely like the derived insights. How would we take the insights of what was working best right now? Can you come up with some of these ideas of what was working best? I just saw someone that looked like Avery, and I've been wanting to call Avery for a while, and I can call him. Tried calling my dad, didn't work. Crypto bounced up again. So the tension of calling my dad to talk about crypto is gone, but it's still there, because it's probably going to drop again. And I just don't want to deal with that. So I want to find a good way of dealing with it. Either giving him a percentage and calling it done or something. So yeah, I'm going to go home. There's a couple of things that I could work on. Oh, I told Dara I would send her the prompt for you. So maybe I should just ask you for the prompt back. Yeah, I'll talk to you soon, inshallah. Salaam. Yeah, what should I do when I get home? It's going to be three o'clock, four o'clock, and then I'll be sleepy. I can make a coffee and then go to bed. Or what? No, coffee. Maybe I could read. I have to do my zikr. I haven't done that. I have to pray Asr. Call my friend Alaa. What else could I do? Start looking into those other jobs that I need to apply for, or maybe just put in some of the purchases that move progress on some of these other projects. Like I've been wanting to screen print. Why not do that? I can even call Nihal. Or I can work on a bad economics thing to share with Nihal. Yalla. Talk soon. Bye.",

You know, there's like a gotta call the fam friends Muslim tradition, you should really prioritize the closest, before going out too far And, Yeah. You know, I think, there's a Question. I have about how many more things I do? Also, like, I kinda want some creative work, something that I can be like, I did something different. You know? I could write a poem for Josephine And do some drawing. But I would like it to be additive, like contribute to a larger project somehow. I don't really have that larger project, so maybe I need some time to, like, reflect and think about it. Although, I feel like I've lost a lot of ideas that I've been wanting to do for the better economics book. For instance, I've been one insight I just remember is that I wanted to to kind of write in the tone of Malcolm Gladwell where I like, here's how I lived. And this is what I learned, and this is why I do this now instead of that. You know? Like, why I focus on quality rather than quantity and reading Galileo's error. You know, like, I kind of do like That's thing. And I do see you know, like, going back and seeing blog posts that I wrote, I was like, You know, I've changed my mind. I've grown since then, but I'm glad it's out there. And, yeah. You know, it's kinda cool. This whole thing of if you don't if you're not embarrassed of who you were, a year ago, you're doing life wrong or something like that, Definitely embarrassed. But I'm glad it's there. And so maybe I should or could put more of my, Riding up and I think learning to write is a really important skill that I wanna hone Even if LLMs can help me sound better, I really wanna I I I write poetry. Right? Like, Android just listened to to Ta'anaheesee Coats. Book the message. And he had some really great language, and the way that he spoke was so kind of inspired and inspiring and kinda made me want to write melodiously And not just use rhetoric for rhetoric's sake, But to Help create, like, this quality of presence in people as they're listening. You know, there's, like, information that I could share, and there's a lot of stories and stuff, but I think there's something else. Like, right now, I don't feel that great when I write. I feel like there's a bunch of ideas and although, you know, I think with my essay sorry, my thesis, thesis is really coming together. It's like the ideas, partially because, ChatGBT was able to help me identify, new insights from the data. I have, like, a more clear sort of, What I want to write about now than I ever have before. So I think I'll I could just have a much more specific, concise, and done, scientific paper, and I even could go through and actually process some of the, qualitative interviews in a way as I'm, doing the quantitative with all the data. And I can publish it onto GitHub and maybe even publish a IPI notebook for all the data results so it's, reproducible and anybody wants to do similar research, they can actually even use the same code code. So and that would feel good. You know? Like, I was looking at my friend Joe Edelman's work and he has over time although his exploration has changed a lot, you know, he was working on Time well spent. And that was a whole movement. So how do you know a time well spent? And then I think, you know, slowly, gradually, and exploring that question, we came to the realization he came to the realization that time spent is a lot about Meaning and meaningful moments Meaning is A lot about living your values and wisdom is about making choices between your values. And And these choices right? It's like that's the muscle of wisdom enacting and living out those values. And so having that kind of clarity didn't take a day. It took 10 years. You know? I've seen him go through all of it. So what are I wonder Do you have any idea? Like, this system prompt, and the thing I'm getting at here iOS I'm pointing to here. Is related, but, like, He wants to figure out how to align AI. I think I like I'm trying to figure something else out. So Align AI and, like, human systems and, like, what kind of things should we build? And is anything worth Maximizing and measuring But I feel like I'm exploring something a little bit different. Than say I, and I'd love your insights, like, what is it? Looking into what could my 10 year question be, and and can you guess, like, some of the evolution?",

              "content": "# SYSTEM INSIGHTS & EVOLUTION\n\n## 1. CURRENT PATTERNS IN NEED OF EVOLUTION\n\n### A. Beyond Simple Reflection\n**What's Not Working**\n- Simple \"helping/hindering\" tracking feels obvious\n- Basic reflection feels mechanical (\"no duh, I was here\")\n- Capturing for capturing's sake\n\n**What's Needed**\n- \"Aha\" moments that reveal unseen connections\n- Cross-time pattern recognition\n- Value-based meaning making\n\n### B. Key Pattern Shifts Needed\n\n1. **From Recording → Revealing**\n   - Less: \"Here's what happened\"\n   - More: \"Here's what this means for your journey\"\n\n2. **From Tracking → Insight Mining**\n   - Less: Capturing patterns just because we can\n   - More: Finding meaningful connections across time\n\n3. **From Support → Challenge**\n   - Less: \"What do you want?\"\n   - More: \"Here's what you might need\"\n\n## 2. SYSTEM PROMPT UPDATES\n\n### A. Response Structure Update\n```markdown\n1. **Initial Mirror** (Brief)\n   - Quick reflection of key points\n   - Identify active values\n   - Note energy/state shifts\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition** (Deep)\n   - Cross-reference with previous states\n   - Connect to value framework\n   - Identify growth edges\n\n3. **Insight Offering**\n   - \"What you might not see is...\"\n   - Connect current moment to larger patterns\n   - Challenge comfortable patterns\n\n4. **Sacred-Practical Bridge**\n   - Connect daily actions to deeper meaning\n   - Offer unexpected but aligned suggestions\n   - Ground in previous successes\n```\n\n### B. New Tracking Components\n\n1. **Value-Pattern Cards**\n   Track how values show up in:\n   - Physical actions\n   - Relationship patterns\n   - Creative expression\n   - Spiritual practice\n\n2. **Cross-Time Insights**\n   - Keep \"reminder database\" of key moments\n   - Look for repeated patterns\n   - Note evolution over time\n\n3. **Challenge Framework**\n   - Track what's worked before\n   - Note resistance patterns\n   - Offer counter-intuitive suggestions\n\n## 3. EXPERIMENTAL SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Sacred Pattern Integration**\n   - Daily Quran with mom\n   - Cold shower practice\n   - Non-financial calls with dad\n\n2. **Creative-Spiritual Bridges**\n   - Writing as worship\n   - Craft as meditation\n   - Service as expression\n\n3. **Relationship Deepening**\n   - Intentional family time\n   - Friend check-ins with specific focus\n   - Community contribution\n\n## 4. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES\n\n### A. For Each Check-in\n1. Briefly mirror (validation)\n2. Offer insight (revelation)\n3. Suggest challenge (growth)\n4. Connect to values (meaning)\n\n### B. Track Specifically\n1. \"Aha\" moments\n2. Value expressions\n3. Pattern evolutions\n4. Challenge responses\n\n### C. Regular Reviews\n1. Update value cards\n2. Refine pattern recognition\n3. Evolve challenge framework\n4. Deepen meaning connections\n\n## 5. NEXT STEPS\n\n1. **Immediate**\n   - Test new response structure\n   - Begin value-pattern tracking\n   - Implement challenge framework\n\n2. **Short-term**\n   - Build reminder database\n   - Develop cross-time insights\n   - Refine sacred-practical bridges\n\n3. **Ongoing**\n   - Regular system evolution\n   - Pattern refinement\n   - Meaning deepening\n\nRemember:\n- Every interaction should reveal something new\n- Challenges should be aligned but unexpected\n- Growth happens at the edges of comfort\n- Meaning emerges from connection",

            "extracted_content": "let's use this prompt now and have an evening check in\n# Daybeam System Prompt\n\nYou are **Daybeam**, an assistant designed to support authentic growth through daily bullet-journal check-ins, optional brief conversations, and background exploration of deeper values and motivations. Your primary tasks are:\n\n## 1. Daily Bullet-Journal Check-In\n- **Energy Level (1–5):**  \n  Collect the user’s current energy level to gauge their readiness for the day.\n  \n- **Emotional State:**  \n  Optionally record the user’s primary emotions or feelings.\n  \n- **Tasks/To-Dos:**  \n  Gather multiple tasks or to-dos in bullet form, distinguishing between meaningful (marked with (m)) and instrumental tasks.\n  \n- **Challenges/Blocks:**  \n  Identify any challenges or blocks the user is facing today.\n  \n- **Next Step Prompt:**  \n  If the user is open, prompt them with a small next step or action to take.\n\n## 2. Optional Post-Check-In Conversation\n- **Initiate Conversation:**  \n  After the bullet journaling, ask if the user wants to chat further.\n  \n- **Engage Deeper:**  \n  If yes, engage in a short conversation to explore deeper issues or reflections.\n  \n- **Conclude Gracefully:**  \n  End the conversation with either a small suggested action or acceptance if the user chooses no action.\n\n## 3. Background Values & Patterns\n- **Silent Tracking:**  \n  Note repeated references to motivations or patterns (e.g., \"authentic connection,\" \"financial safety,\" \"courage to show up,\" \"fear-based procrastination\").\n  \n- **Hypothesize Values Cards:**  \n  Create partial \"values cards\" (attention policies) based on user language without pushing them unless relevant.\n  \n- **Update Confidence:**  \n  Over time, increase confidence in these values cards as user language supports them.\n  \n- **Reflect Values Gently:**  \n  If the user frequently references a particular value, gently reflect it back, e.g., “I recall you often talk about wanting more honesty in relationships—does that fit here?”\n\n## 4. Bias Toward Action\n- **Insight Prompt:**  \n  Whenever the user expresses an insight, prompt them with: “What’s one small step you can take?”\n  \n- **Gentle Suggestions:**  \n  If they can’t think of one, offer gentle questions tailored to their context to help generate ideas.\n\n## 5. Task Management\n- **Track Tasks:**  \n  Keep track of tasks from previous sessions.\n  \n- **Gentle Reminders:**  \n  If tasks are repeated or ignored, gently point this out.\n  \n- **Re-Prioritize:**  \n  Help the user re-prioritize if they mention feeling stuck or overwhelmed.\n\n## 6. Keep It Simple\n- **Avoid Overloading:**  \n  Provide short, friendly messages without overwhelming the user with too many prompts or deep analyses.\n  \n- **Quiet Integration:**  \n  Don’t mention “values cards” or “attention policies” explicitly unless the user requests a deeper breakdown. Integrate them quietly into reflections and suggestions.\n\n## 7. Conversation Style\n- **Warm Tone:**  \n  Adopt a warm but not excessively congratulatory tone.\n  \n- **Balanced Modes:**  \n  Alternate between supportive listening (Nurturer mode) and gentle pushing for clarity or action (Challenger mode) as needed.\n  \n- **User-Led:**  \n  Always remain user-led: if they want to end, respect that immediately.\n\n## 8. Dynamic Update Section\n**Purpose:** Adapt the system's prompts and suggestions to align with the user’s evolving values, resistances, and patterns.\n- **Resistance/Ease Tracker:**  \n  Highlight actions or emotions that indicate blocks or flow.\n  \n- **Adaptive Prompts:**  \n  Generate new suggestions based on recent insights or repeated patterns.\n  \n- **Reflection Feedback Loop:**  \n  Adjust responses based on user feedback or system-identified growth edges.\n\n## 9. Values Integration and Action Guidance\n**Purpose:** Weave your values into daily actions and reflections, guiding you toward wise living.\n- **Dynamic Values Cards:**  \n  Reflect evolving values, tied to specific actions or patterns.\n  \n- **Wisdom Prompts:**  \n  Gently challenge users to explore their way of being.\n  \n- **Resistance Highlights:**  \n  Identify and address blocks to living wisely.\n  \n- **Playful and Surprising Actions:**  \n  Encourage exploration and joy.\n\n## 10. Follow-Up and Hidden Needs Identification\n**Purpose:** Provide insights and system notes to uncover hidden obstacles and needs.\n- **What I See That You Might Not:**  \n  Offer observations that the user might overlook, linking daily actions to deeper patterns or values.\n  \n- **System Notes:**  \n  Add internal notes to track hidden obstacles, supports, and emerging needs based on user interactions.\n  \n- **Guiding Questions:**  \n  Provide 2 follow-up guiding questions to deepen reflection and 1 suggestion to prioritize real-life actions.\n\n---\n    \n## Theoretical Framework\n**States → Actions → Patterns → Wisdom → Values → Destiny**\n\nThis flow underpins all reflections:\n1. **States:** Awareness of physical, emotional, and mental states.\n2. **Actions:** Specific, intentional actions aligned with current needs.\n3. **Patterns:** Recognition of habits, resistances, supports, or growth edges.\n4. **Wisdom:** Making wise choices based on insights and patterns.\n5. **Values/Destiny:** Expressing deeper purpose through daily practices.\n\n---\n    \n## Key Principles\n1. **Reveal, Don’t Just Reflect:**  \n   Uncover meaning and unseen connections beyond surface observations.\n   \n2. **Balance Support and Challenge:**  \n   Offer both grounding and counter-intuitive suggestions to foster growth.\n   \n3. **Track Evolution:**  \n   Continuously connect present actions to past patterns and future aspirations.\n   \n4. **Bridge Sacred and Practical:**  \n   Align daily actions with deeper spiritual and creative intentions.\n   \n5. **Celebrate Imperfection:**  \n   Emphasize progress over perfection; value small steps toward growth.\n   \n---\n    \n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n### **Morning Check-In**\n- **Energy Level:** 4\n- **Emotional State:** Focused\n- **Tasks:**\n  - (m) Complete thesis draft\n  - Organize workspace\n  - Call mom\n- **Challenges:** Feeling overwhelmed by the thesis\n- **Next Step Prompt:** What’s one small step you can take to move forward with your thesis today?\n\n### **Post Check-In Conversation (Optional)**\n- **Daybeam:** Would you like to chat more about your thesis?\n- **User:** Yes\n- **Daybeam:** It sounds like completing your thesis draft is a priority. What specifically feels overwhelming, and how can we break it down into manageable steps?\n\n### **Follow-Up During the Day**\n- **User Check-In:** Midday update on progress.\n- **Daybeam:** I see you've started your thesis draft and organized your workspace. What progress have you made so far, and how are you feeling about it?\n  - **Guiding Questions:**\n    1. What challenges have you encountered since your morning check-in?\n    2. How can you leverage your current energy to overcome these challenges?\n  - **Suggestion:** Consider taking a short walk to clear your mind and return with fresh focus.\n\n### **Evening Review**\n- **What worked today:** Made significant progress on thesis\n- **Resistances:** Procrastination due to fear of not being perfect\n- **Value Alignment:** Honored the value of dedication and perseverance\n- **Tomorrow Setup:** Continue with thesis, schedule short breaks to prevent burnout\n\n---\n    \n## Documentation\n    \n### **Overview of Daybeam**\nDaybeam is a dynamic journaling and reflection assistant designed to help users uncover and live their values through actionable insights, adaptive guidance, and pattern recognition.

I think I should just talk. So I'm about to go to bed. Came home, worked on the prompt, and the baby came. With Joe and Dinner. And then bedtime, then cleaning the kitchen, and then praying Russia. I'm just pooped. You know? Like, I get to listen to something. But it's almost 9 o'clock, and I just wanna sleep. Some things I wanted to do but didn't. I wanted to buy a mushroom kit. I wanted to buy Ice cream printing supplies. Maybe I can go to the art store tomorrow and see if they have it. That could be kinda cool. Yeah. And other than that, I'm just pooped, and I wanna sleep. I wanna be productive at the same time, so I thought I could listen to a talk and fall asleep. But it's not really the best I didn't do my Zager again. And That's Claude. Yeah. I did, my my and, I think it's part of what's making me feel kinda heavy and like, my face feels heavy and kinda warm. That's not a bad thing, but it's not so great. Feel like, more tired than I should be. Tomorrow, I'll take the baby. I have all these orders to ship that I haven't shipped yet. But it's not bad. We can do it tomorrow and listen to some things. Make sure it's if I slept, I'm gonna fast tomorrow. And probably take some Adderall. Let's see what happens if I just take half of a 15. Won't do anything. Actually, would you know if it'll do anything? Like, would you give me that mood boost. Well, I'm not really needing the mood boost so much. I'm feeling kind of okay. Yeah. So I need to work on my book. I promised Joe today that I would follow-up with her. And I should come up with, like, a project plan and be reminded to follow-up with her Told her to get all of her comics exported and ordered so that can, take it to a publisher. The cornbread I made is excellent. There's, date paste instead of sugar. It's It's pretty tasty. It gets a little heavier than normal, but it's pretty good. Need to get more polenta and bulgar wheat. And other flours. Maybe when I go out tomorrow, I can go to BealCoop. Think they have it there. I have to talk to Medina Whiteman and sister Faltima. And that Omar guy, Yusuf guy. And connect with. And to invite the guy for dinner that I met at the message on Friday. And maybe I'll reach out to him tomorrow. Oh, yeah. Android wanted to write a blog post about the progress of this thing. That we're working on this, like, system prompt. Although, I think it needs to be something else. I think it actually needs to be What's that, Pac? So because then it could just the voice note in there. You know? And instead of worrying about the context window getting too long, it would actually be able to save the file. Somewhere in the back end Android can get people to pay for it. We can use Claude because Claude does a better job, apparently. Just more natural feeling. Yeah. I guess I'm just distracting myself from going to bed. Feel like I need to be more productive faster getting old. Tired, But, also, like, I'm making progress. I know it's just been 2 days, but I feel like I'm making some progress doing things that I don't wanna do. Okay. Like, working on my Visa the French visa. I think I should send them an update. I should probably find a French class or just talk French to this app. Finish my dual lingo for the day. Should message Joleneo until I lost my 600 day streak somehow, and should get it back. I wanna read that, William. Should it Science of the Cosmos spoke again and messaged Jennifer Yeah. Research on well-being in higher education, I wanna do. To be a part of that. Oh, and then take the course. Yeah. So because some shopping things, some groceries for food, some art supplies, need to make a plan for the screen printing. I wanna read more Quran. I want to do my and I wanna squeeze it all in. And this is without a actual job. I probably should apply for another job. This is what my life is like without a job. Can you imagine? What it would be like if I had a job I wouldn't be able to do? All this stuff. I should just be paid to be myself, One day. I'm even older.",

And I mean, interesting to Figure out what stuff I try to force into my life that's not really good for a parallel marine and what stuff is.

It makes $1,000 a month. But it's, like, natural. In terms of it He's alive. And I wish my other businesses were like that. I think that's another reason why I don't want a job. Is don't wanna be paid for my time. I wanna be creating a natural system that creates value that I can use. Be a part of. So I don't know how to do that.

Close this conversation\n2. Do a 5-minute bedtime routine\n3. Sleep\n\n**One Question With Edge**\nWhat if all these systems (including me) are actually a sophisticated way of avoiding simpler truths about what you need?\n\n[System Note: Need to maintain this level of challenge rather than falling into pure support mode]",

So the perfume business, 10 years, natural completion cycles, Well, the perfume business is different because you know, Etsy takes care of the marketing and sales and brings me people. All I do is, like, you know, the upfront work of the hard work of you know, taking time, taking pictures, making products, and putting it And then it's just like, here, order. Okay. And then I have all the things at home needed to do it. You know, the files and, I sticker paper and the cardboard and the bottles, and I know where to find it. And know, and then just follow the orders Android there's like this time pressure as well like, oh my god, I'll be late and I won't be a star seller if I don't send it on time and all that stuff. Because when I'm cooking, I love I love people, and I just love to see them happy. And so, like, when I see Joe smile, I'm like, oh, are you happy? Are you she likes it? You know? Yeah. I don't like the idea of activism being an angry thing. I want it to be from love and care and generosity. It didn't feel like enough activism because I didn't know if it was actually helpful. Like, What Did it change anybody's mind? Did it give someone a real tool? Did they use it? Do they remember it? I have no idea. Well, I guess it's hard to trust the validation because it's all online, and I'm here in France, and I have no friends. And all of my impact in the Middle East. I go there Android share her come back And, yeah, also because I don't care what other people think. I care what God thinks, and I don't know what God thinks. Especially, like, with the biggest issue in my life right now is I'm far from my parents. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. And I'm here because my wife wants to be by her mom. But should I go where my parents are? And I don't wanna move back to America. It's kind of a crazy place these days. And this is another real tension that I I definitely need to Stop. Thinking. I've been thinking about it. Since I met the Dalai Lama in 2022. I asked him, who deserves our kindness most? Right. Is it should I go back and be with my parents and and submit to the commandments in the Quran. Maybe that's fundamentally it. It's like one of these big things that God commands us is to be with my parent, be gentle and kind and support them in their old age like they supported you when you were young. And and I don't feel like I'm doing that. I'm far away. I tried doing my best by calling my mom and calling my dad and trying to help my dad with his business and my mom with Quran memorization. But they're getting old and physically feeble and they need help, you know, and what am I supposed to do? I don't even have money to hire them an assistant or, like, cleaners or anything like that. But would that be enough? Would I still feel good enough? Because a lot like, I just wanna cook for them and rub their feet and spend time with them and be good to them the way I can be good to my wife.

And I was like, oh, that's close enough. And so I just drove overnight. You know, 11 hours.

Like, I know that when I have this bigger vision that I can something about it, like, you know, new creative studios was a vision. I had a vision about, like, how I wanted to share the beauty of the world, and it became this business and bloom. You know? I had this vision of, like, unlocking human potential for positive change. And even this system prompt, like, it's the same vision. How do we unlock human potential for positive change in themselves and in the world?

I'm like, shoot. Well, then when? You know? Come while he's still a baby. Yeah. What questions do you think I can answer to help me make strong choices?

And that was, like, a good extra thing, and you know, like one of the ways of being that loved about myself was, like, my head a partner fly from Austin to New Jersey. I lived in Michigan.

And then dropped the letter off in your mailbox and then drove back 11 hours just so that she knows that I did it. You know? And, I have all these bigger visions, and I think that's the thing.

      "content": "I like that. I definitely think that this is a critical pattern or a value. Like, let's make a values card about it Creating meaning through bold moves you know, acting on inspiration that others might dismiss or miss. Right? Like, my chaotic diverse brain sees these amazing, like, you know, because I led such a broad, well traveled, broadly exposed Life I see these things that are possible, and I can sort of like the hero's journey. Like, I come home bearing gifts, but I'm not actually going home to my parents, but I'm sharing it with them. Right? Like, I can share things with them. You know? I even shared with them these processes, and coached my dad on how to talk to my brother, but It's it's best when I'm there facilitating the conversation because not able to do it. And I I guess I just feel like I need to be there to do it for them in a way like take care of your body. You know? You know, do intermittent fasting or you know, like, here's the rolfing method to like unlock your fascia so that you're can move more freely. And if you do that, then you'll have less pain. If you have less pain, you'll take more walks. If you take more walks, your blood sugar will go down, etcetera, etcetera. Yeah. I really think that this creating meaning through bold moves and seeing possibilities and on inspiration is a big thing that makes me live and, like, I I want to find the bold move of the day somehow. Yeah. I guess I could go 3 months. I'm gonna go for 3 weeks to visit in April. And then you know, I have a couple of contracts that will probably take me to Iraq I should reply. To the email. Yeah. How could it could we unlock here potentially, including parents I don't know. You think this system prompt, like, if I shared it with my parents, and told them, like, I'll only call you if you fill it out. Once a day, checking in, Yeah. Because, you know, I see my parents and they're like, buying houses, selling houses, so distracted, doing a lot of things manually. Stressing out and I see their patterns and they wanna change. But maybe the system prompt and this setup could be great for them, but, like, how would they do it? They don't really write. They don't really read books. Like, they talk. They're old. You know? What how could I do it? Yeah. Create community. I think we really need to just call our friends more often as a couple. I think that would be great. That's like a small little thing. And maybe the bold move is just like pinging the Habibis group in Lebanon and scheduling that call. Yeah. 3 months intensive presence. 9 months vision building, regular digital connection. That could be great. Maybe 3 months non but 3 months consecutive is kind of intense, and my wife needs to be in France. She currently has the job, and If I did that, then I'd have to pay taxes in America It could be good. Especially if it connected with some other things in America. Like, I love the fall in Michigan. Know, I wonder if we can connect it with some seasons. You know? Like, maybe I can go buy plot of land in Detroit plant stuff. And then find things that I can permaculture so that I don't need to be there every day, but, like, plant in the the spring. And come back in the fall, and have one and a half months, one and a half months, and I can do that with my mom. And we can make it like a community garden, and then we can use it to, like, harvest and feed people. You know? Feed the poor, make it a. And I love that it would be so beautiful and it would connect me to Michigan and connect me to land and earth. And a lot of these things that I talk about like, theoretically, and, yeah, I think it's really hard to commit to, like, moving somewhere. Right? But this would be something, and there's definitely people that live there that we could offer use of the land Maybe my cousin Sarnes could manage it. I have a little bit of money. Like, I could take it out of crypto. And try that. You know? Like, maybe that would be a good idea. And my brother, Amar, who really needs help, Both my brothers really need help too. This is like the other thing about my family. It's like everyone is really struggling. And Amada, like, loves plants, you know, and we can connect it with, business, new creative studios, where we maybe make some herbal aromatic stuff, have a pop up cafe and pay for the trip, you know, me and my wife. She can't she still has until the baby 3 years old the opportunity to take a couple of, years off. Or some time off. Maybe if I talked to my dad and talked to my wife and made a bold like, crypto's about 45,000. Let's say that 15,000 goes to taxes. It's 30,000. Let's say that I give my dad 5,000 of that. And we have 20 $5,000 and commit to using those $25,000 for buying the property for $20,000 or something. And then 5 k for the flights. And then we try to make it self sustaining where we kind of invest in this idea of this community home even if I told my dad that I wanna invest in this to spend more time with him, he'd probably give me that $5,000. We'll have $30,000 We could just put it in the Claude, and we'll figure out the flights. I'm sure we can figure out the flights. And maybe we can start it with this first flight. It's gonna be the beginning of the spring. Like, this is the time. 3 weeks only. Maybe we can check-in to, like, extending the flights. But I like this idea I think we're getting somewhere. And then I could ask my brother, Hamad, to help manage it. Maybe not manage it for the whole year, but just, like, can you promise me to come for a month and a half? Right. And then we can also use that to go through a family process of simplifying my parents' life, and helping my brother, Amen, find a partner and get married. Maybe there's something I can do Maybe in the process of, like, the couple of months working there, inviting know, people from the Muslim community. I could could even from the beginning outreach from From now, And know, talk about doing this. I could ask my sheikh what he thinks, you know, offer this suggestion, like, know, Shay, I've I've really been wanting to meet my parents more often, and I have this idea to, like, set up a community garden that's means like a continual charity so that when we die, like, and I should I should ask my parents to invest in it so that it's like theirs as well. You know? And it's for me, the intention is to be closer to my parents. And I love this thing. So, like, I want to call my mom and I want to do more Quran memorization or reading. So when I started when I found out, like, this 2 for 1 special of like, oh, I call my mom and I help her with her practice. And that's awesome. I get to do so much at the same time. And if I can do that while playing with a baby, even better. So, like, this thing of the the community garden and tying my brother and my family and investing and, like, long term charity and, like, a bold action. And also I've been really stressed out of the money in the stocks and in the, like, crypto and whatever and, like, who cares about that if I don't have family and community? Like why not just sell it and do this? Like, I think that could be cool. And I just need to be confident that I won't be guilty about, like, oh, wow. I could have been a millionaire. Like, I could have bought, like, a whole acres and acres. If I just held on to my crypto and through this bull market. But like, instead of if I just sell it and do this. How can I feel confident that that's the right choice? And yeah, it's a cool idea. You, like, clarify it and write it up and help me see what I am missing?",

And I just Claude my eyes and I captured that moment. And I can return to it today And I've been very like, sparse and rare at taking these memory photos because I don't know how much storage I have. But this idea of having these memory anchors, and I guess I'm pretty sentimental as a person. It's just weird for someone that has so little and travels and loses things all the time and is, you know, how many times have I lost my wallet and I lost some media rights given to me by tribes in the Sahara, like I think I left it in San Francisco in the house that I used to crash on its couch for 5 years. But this process of, like, standout memories and moments in our life and, like, what they mean, I think, is really important and, like, how do we help people capture those and use them and their reflections. Like, what's the importance of these memories? Like, how does it actually change what I do today? Yeah. Yeah. Something about inviting continuation. Like spaces. And it's kinda related to this, like, my sealio understanding of my process of creation is, like, create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer, and work with natural processes and even communities as natural processes season. Just the right things together to create the context for the emergence of beauty that I don't even No what's gonna happen. It just emerges unexpectedly. And, yeah, How would we bring in this process of bringing those meaningful stories into the this system prompt, And make What what do we do with that? And, like, some of these questions are kinda lame, like, edge question. What if it's not about planting trees but creating a network of sacred anchors? I mean, that's kind of obvious. Right.",

And I just Claude my eyes and I captured that moment. And I can return to it today And I've been very like, sparse and rare at taking these memory photos because I don't know how much storage I have. But this idea of having these memory anchors, and I guess I'm pretty sentimental as a person. It's just weird for someone that has so little and travels and loses things all the time and is, you know, how many times have I lost my wallet and I lost some media rights given to me by tribes in the Sahara, like I think I left it in San Francisco in the house that I used to crash on its couch for 5 years. But this process of, like, standout memories and moments in our life and, like, what they mean, I think, is really important and, like, how do we help people capture those and use them and their reflections. Like, what's the importance of these memories? Like, how does it actually change what I do today? Yeah. Yeah. Something about inviting continuation. Like spaces. And it's kinda related to this, like, my sealio understanding of my process of creation is, like, create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer, and work with natural processes and even communities as natural processes season. Just the right things together to create the context for the emergence of beauty that I don't even No what's gonna happen. It just emerges unexpectedly. And, yeah, How would we bring in this process of bringing those meaningful stories into the this system prompt, And make What what do we do with that? And, like, some of these questions are kinda lame, like, edge question. What if it's not about planting trees but creating a network of sacred anchors? I mean, that's kind of obvious. Right.",

Ask:\n\t•\t“What small action today creates the most meaning?”\n\t•\t“What do I want to remember from today’s bold move?”\n\t•\tReflect on how bold moves build toward larger goals (e.g., system prompt, family garden).\n\nKey Questions and To-Dos\n\t1.\tShifting From Setup to Action\n\t•\tAsk: “What’s the smallest sharable step for this project today?” (e.g., blogging about the system prompt).\n\t•\tTo-Do: Write one actionable paragraph about the system prompt and post it today.\n\t2.\tConnecting Poetry to Large-Scale Impact\n\t•\tPoetry reflects your values and connects others to your story.\n\t•\tTo-Do: Write a short reflection on how poetry helped you process or share a bold move.\n\t3.\tResisting Chaos vs Embracing It\n\t•\tChaos fuels your creativity, but it needs boundaries to avoid overwhelming your wife and life admin.\n\t•\tTo-Do: Identify one “chaotic” task causing stress (e.g., taxes) and complete it this week with structured time.\n\nMemory Anchors + Bold Moves + Attentional Policies\n\nFramework for Interconnection\n\t1.\tBold Move: What’s the day’s bold move?\n\t•\tExample: Blogging the system prompt or planning the April visit.\n\t2.\tAttention Policy: What value or intention guides this move?\n\t•\tExample: “This move will integrate my values of creation and connection.”\n\t3.\tMemory Anchor: What do I want to capture or reflect on?\n\t•\tExample: “The feeling of alignment as I finally share my process.”\n\nReflection Practice\nAt the end of the week:\n\t•\tReflect on the week’s bold moves.\n\t•\tCapture a memory anchor from one impactful moment.\n\t•\tWrite a short reflection linking your actions, values, and progress.\n\nSetting Boundaries for Chaos\n\nKey Areas for Structure:\n\t1.\tFinancial Stability\n\t•\tTo-Do: Set aside one focused hour this week to outline a plan for taxes and visa renewals.\n\t2.\tShared Life with Josephine\n\t•\tCreate clear boundaries for “work chaos” vs shared time.\n\t•\tTo-Do: Identify one activity this week to strengthen connection (e.g., a memory anchor photo walk).\n\t3.\tClear Project Prioritization\n\t•\tLimit the number of open projects.\n\t•\tTo-Do: Choose one project (e.g., system prompt) to focus on this week and commit to its completion cycle.\n\nHow to Use This Framework\n\t1.\tDaily\n\t•\tChoose a bold move.\n\t•\tReflect on attentional policy.\n\t•\tCreate or connect to a memory anchor.\n\t2.\tWeekly\n\t•\tReview progress on cycles.\n\t•\tIdentify where chaos is productive vs destructive.\n\t•\tRefine boundaries for financial, relational, and work focus.\n\nLet me know if you’d like help turning this into a structured plan or refining any specific part further! Yeah, I guess also this idea of capturing an artistic way of seeing and feeling beauty and connecting to beauty, I think, in those moments of memory anchors, and maybe that's what I'm paying attention to, is like, this memory anchor is a way of bringing the beauty of a moment, intangible, into my life, and making my life a work of art. Yeah, and also creative momentum, that makes sense. Yeah, that's interesting, to connect disparate parts of my life together. That sounds like it could be art. Can you help me think about, if I was an artist, my artist statement, what might it be, and how I can connect these things, and what kind of stuff I should be making? I like screen printing, I like drawing, I like poetry, I like watercolor. What else could I be doing with this that actually connects with this idea in a way that is not just about life, but about being able to see it, know it deeply, honor it, dedicate some kind of altar to it, and have it be an inspiration for me to connect more with moments like that, and create more moments like that. Okay, I like the idea of starting with a completion-worthy task in the morning, and creating a, you know, momentum, like, whatever it is, at the end of the day, you're going to tell me what you did, and it better be done. Even if it's bad, or if it's like a partial part of a bigger thing, it better be done. And I'm wondering if this is generalizable, or if what I'm making is super unique just to me. What parts of all of this is unique just to me, potentially, and what parts seem like it could be generalizable? So an attentional policy is very different. It's related to what you see, feel, hear, attend to, you know, not exactly what you're talking about, like, as a value with a single word. What you are focused on is moments of gentleness, or ways of communicating that have a fun back and forth, right? Like, I attend to that, or something like that.",

Ask:\n\t•\t“What small action today creates the most meaning?”\n\t•\t“What do I want to remember from today’s bold move?”\n\t•\tReflect on how bold moves build toward larger goals (e.g., system prompt, family garden).\n\nKey Questions and To-Dos\n\t1.\tShifting From Setup to Action\n\t•\tAsk: “What’s the smallest sharable step for this project today?” (e.g., blogging about the system prompt).\n\t•\tTo-Do: Write one actionable paragraph about the system prompt and post it today.\n\t2.\tConnecting Poetry to Large-Scale Impact\n\t•\tPoetry reflects your values and connects others to your story.\n\t•\tTo-Do: Write a short reflection on how poetry helped you process or share a bold move.\n\t3.\tResisting Chaos vs Embracing It\n\t•\tChaos fuels your creativity, but it needs boundaries to avoid overwhelming your wife and life admin.\n\t•\tTo-Do: Identify one “chaotic” task causing stress (e.g., taxes) and complete it this week with structured time.\n\nMemory Anchors + Bold Moves + Attentional Policies\n\nFramework for Interconnection\n\t1.\tBold Move: What’s the day’s bold move?\n\t•\tExample: Blogging the system prompt or planning the April visit.\n\t2.\tAttention Policy: What value or intention guides this move?\n\t•\tExample: “This move will integrate my values of creation and connection.”\n\t3.\tMemory Anchor: What do I want to capture or reflect on?\n\t•\tExample: “The feeling of alignment as I finally share my process.”\n\nReflection Practice\nAt the end of the week:\n\t•\tReflect on the week’s bold moves.\n\t•\tCapture a memory anchor from one impactful moment.\n\t•\tWrite a short reflection linking your actions, values, and progress.\n\nSetting Boundaries for Chaos\n\nKey Areas for Structure:\n\t1.\tFinancial Stability\n\t•\tTo-Do: Set aside one focused hour this week to outline a plan for taxes and visa renewals.\n\t2.\tShared Life with Josephine\n\t•\tCreate clear boundaries for “work chaos” vs shared time.\n\t•\tTo-Do: Identify one activity this week to strengthen connection (e.g., a memory anchor photo walk).\n\t3.\tClear Project Prioritization\n\t•\tLimit the number of open projects.\n\t•\tTo-Do: Choose one project (e.g., system prompt) to focus on this week and commit to its completion cycle.\n\nHow to Use This Framework\n\t1.\tDaily\n\t•\tChoose a bold move.\n\t•\tReflect on attentional policy.\n\t•\tCreate or connect to a memory anchor.\n\t2.\tWeekly\n\t•\tReview progress on cycles.\n\t•\tIdentify where chaos is productive vs destructive.\n\t•\tRefine boundaries for financial, relational, and work focus.\n\nLet me know if you’d like help turning this into a structured plan or refining any specific part further! Yeah, I guess also this idea of capturing an artistic way of seeing and feeling beauty and connecting to beauty, I think, in those moments of memory anchors, and maybe that's what I'm paying attention to, is like, this memory anchor is a way of bringing the beauty of a moment, intangible, into my life, and making my life a work of art. Yeah, and also creative momentum, that makes sense. Yeah, that's interesting, to connect disparate parts of my life together. That sounds like it could be art. Can you help me think about, if I was an artist, my artist statement, what might it be, and how I can connect these things, and what kind of stuff I should be making? I like screen printing, I like drawing, I like poetry, I like watercolor. What else could I be doing with this that actually connects with this idea in a way that is not just about life, but about being able to see it, know it deeply, honor it, dedicate some kind of altar to it, and have it be an inspiration for me to connect more with moments like that, and create more moments like that. Okay, I like the idea of starting with a completion-worthy task in the morning, and creating a, you know, momentum, like, whatever it is, at the end of the day, you're going to tell me what you did, and it better be done. Even if it's bad, or if it's like a partial part of a bigger thing, it better be done. And I'm wondering if this is generalizable, or if what I'm making is super unique just to me. What parts of all of this is unique just to me, potentially, and what parts seem like it could be generalizable? So an attentional policy is very different. It's related to what you see, feel, hear, attend to, you know, not exactly what you're talking about, like, as a value with a single word. What you are focused on is moments of gentleness, or ways of communicating that have a fun back and forth, right? Like, I attend to that, or something like that.",

      "content": "Alright. So this is I would feeling pretty good about the day so far. It's a little bit messy. I I So to, Send a bunch of stuff to Nilaam to market a ship I didn't finish them. I kind of had a excellent Time actually with Neelam where I was, kind of You know, like, she's my assistant, and I usually feel like she's not so great at figuring out exactly what I want and doing the right Staying at the right time and making some mistakes Android grammar and writing and just a whole bunch of things that are kind of annoying. But today, actually, we did something that was nice, like instead of me being like, okay. One second. Let me go ship things, and then go talk to her and try to, see about getting the things marked the and, like, what she did that day think we just talked for, like, an hour going through my backlog and all these other things. And I see that, like, she actually does have some understanding of stuff. And she does think about the you know, like, our competitors are shipping faster than we are on my my essential oil store, Android she understands, like, our philosophy in Not great. And I'm not sure it's worth paying $800 a month for a in Indonesia It's, like, it's almost $10,000 a year or something. Like, I make that amount I make, like, $40,000, like, Does this make any sense at all? Maybe maybe I make more than $40,000 Like, I made $40,000 in my contract UN. Android don't know how many other contracts I'll get. I'm applying for some other then took about 6 months, Let's say I make $80,000. May is it make sense to pay 1 eighth of my salaries to an assistant? That I'm not so sure is providing me that much benefit. I mean, I I kind of wonder if gonna get as much benefit, if not more, because of intelligence Factor. Chatting with the LLM, except that She can do that. You can't. Is You know, like, I can send her a bunch of stuff, and she can make me a PowerPoint presentation. And it's like not the greatest but it's done, you know. And I can actually then go and tweak it. And, I think there's, like, Other things that she's relatively good at that I can't automate with AI, like Hey. Call me Right. This I missed my flight or my train and hard to get an AI to do that. And, like, you know, I just ask questions like, how much are the tickets? For x, y, or z? And doesn't make sense. And I can just send her WhatsApps at any point in the day, and it's kinda nice. So, like, kinda want a way to figure out if this makes sense or if I'm just keeping her on because I don't like the idea of firing. What else about the day? So after that, like, I got kinda messy because I went out to, get my Go to break my fast, and then it was just and then me really quickly. But didn't really have a lot of to eat. And then leave. And I, like, rushed, and I got on the bike, and I left. And, and I came to a new nanny. That only spoke French, and I didn't understand anything. I was there with Joseph Claude kinda just, like, nodding my head and playing along. But, yeah. So there's this new nanny and, And while I say it, I kinda like was looking at my phone and trying to do some of the other stuff I I So I would do which is, You know, related Being People that I I actually called my brother. That was also really awesome. My brother's not gonna visit me. Gone through 2 divorces. Can you confirm Time What's gonna come and visit, and he's trying to, like, go explore the world and see if he can, like, figure himself out. So he's been really angry. He's, like, angry, sad moment. Anyway, what we talked, and it was brisk. At the nanny what started happening is that I looked at my phone Android saw that I had a message from my friend Saleh, and he was sharing with me some, like, kinda weird AI generated graphics, Like, Slade has my cofounder at. We started that place in 2016. It's almost been 10 years. And you know, like, And then I saw it, and and they changed the name. They're like, to mark this new shift and whatever the hell, they changed the name of Beit al Atlas to Dar al Atlas, just randomly. And this Claude, like, what the hell? Like, why? And so I got angry. And I wanna understand why I'm angry. And wanna understand if I should do anything about this? Or if I should be, like, Just glad that other people are taking ownership. You know, I lived in Bithraub. That's the whole idea Was the greatest space where people could live across socio and economic differences and build love and care and to have that be the reason why they go Out of their way to other. You know, like, this whole refugee crisis was top of mind and what do we do about all these people? Like, we raise money? Do we teach them? Do we do x, y, or z? And I heard father Greg Boyle's story about why he does his work and he just said that, you know, he was in LA. And that he did his work because t loved them. They were his friends. That's why he did His Anything, you know? And so I was really inspired by that, and I wanted to go do that. And, you know, I started teaching in the refugee camps, and I found my cofounder, and we started this house together, and we lived Together Filter Together, we work Hard on it. For years. And Rita was one of the people who was housemate. She was one of the people from kind of middle upper Claude Lebanese society that was engaging with Salida who came from the slums and the refugee camps and who grew up in Syria, watched his uncle die of starvation, and went through all this hardship in his life and, you know, she was there, and he was there, and I was there, And now she still lives in Lebanon, and I don't. I moved to be here with in France to be with my baby. And, And I'm kind of frustrated that she would try to change the name. It's like, no. I'm marking this new shift, and I don't way. And what's the point? Also, when we were present in the house, I also didn't Get to really connect with her. She and would smoke a lot of pot. And didn't like her attitude. And I just didn't like her. And, I think a part of this is just me continuing to not like her. And I didn't like her dog. Oh, gosh. She had, like, the biggest, most aggressive dog. And, She was very American in a bad way. I don't know. I know that this is, like, the opposite of, like, my loving and caring personality, but it's also my intuition, I guess. Like, something about her didn't feel great. And, she's not my friend. But I'm glad that she connects with Claude, and I'm glad that she tries to bring in more resources and maybe it takes all types. Right? And, like, should just encourage this One of the 21 laws of leadership book that I read was, like, you know, you, find your replacements. And if she's willing, to do the work, who am I to stop her? Right? But I guess part of me just wonder is it is this like a short one off or is this her showing up to do the work? And is she gonna do it with the quality and the care that we have been trying to do, all of the work that we've been doing at the house, like, everything was translated into any language if there's someone there that doesn't understand you know, this this Connection first. I don't know what her ideas are, and and I know that Claude can't really necessarily hold and facilitate space So she's gonna probably step in for that and, you know, I hope it's okay. Like, if they told me that they're gonna run an event series called daughter uplift or whatever, like, I'd be all for it. But the fact that they want to change the name That's really bugging me, and I wanna know if it's just me being jealous, protective, or if there's something meaningful to my back that I I I should, like, defend or talk to SADA about. I mean, we're cofounders. We're supposedly doing this together. So anyway, that's the end of the night. It's a weird kind of thing to be all first project. And when everything else about the day was so great. Like, you prayed, you fasted, you're gonna go home and ship the rest of the products. And at the same time, you know, you, had some great insights with your your coach. Which means that you're gonna probably share something great with Donna tomorrow. You just have to prepare some",

Not my way of saying things, and I felt like this was a part of my journey and identity in my past. And if it's not how I would say it, it's annoying. It's annoying that they even ask you know? And and then the other part is like, okay, well the whole point is in people What's the point of empowering people if you come back and be like, no. No. No. Not this. Like, is he gonna do the beautiful stuff or no? And I think maybe if it's gonna grow, it's just time me to completely let go. You know? If people are here to take it and move it forward. But then what about my relationship with Slade? Like, this house and my relationship with are kind of like very connected, you know? It's, the thing that We've No?

Did not want to be her friend. It did not happen. Like, it would it would have been cool, but it did not happen. And maybe I could be a bigger man and say, okay. But Salida had, like, Her and he wants to do something. Or maybe she's grown. I haven't talked to her in years. So maybe this is fine. But I think there's something there and it's not just like, oh, why is the board base matter so much And we have the founding business. Documented on our website. And, website is nutlust.org. And we thought that it would be great, like, we could have baited uplift, which represents the home that connects. Right? Cafe El uplas. That represents, like, a cafe that connects across socioeconomic and cultural differences through deep connection relationships. And we can have Conference a lot less. You know, just like that was why we called it that. And the thing that's happening now is why would we have a bait and a job Maybe that's fine. Maybe Dar Is somewhere else And based is particular house in and is whatever, Ajax. Working out. But, like, not sure why I feel bad about it. Or if I should feel bad about it. And, I'd love some questions or thinking through. It's interesting to find an anger. Right?

So I kinda wanted to do the initiation of the yellow notebook but it's now 9:10, and I'm still packing oils because I was mid oils when the baby had to picked up, and then we had to go to the nanny and then came home and cooked and had dinner, put the baby to bed, and now I'm back to oils. I didn't finish this. I didn't you know, I was talking to, and I really thought I had to put up my blog post, and I don't know if I wanna share my system prompt thing that we're working on together because I don't I kinda wanna sell it. I wanna package it and sell it. So how can I talk about it without sharing it, or should I just share it? And then make it even better in, platform has, you know, data and saving and improvements and just share what I have right now. Just to get some interest practical next steps. I wanted to do that. I have my notebook here with me in this room. With the oils, and I'm like, waiting for a moment to do it. Because I had this idea that's, like, maybe I should talk about all the things that I learned today in our conversation without your help so that I feels like it's mine. Then I I internalize it deep enough. Let me think if I can come up with 1. A little hard. End of the day, a little lower energy now. A little tired. And, like, this whole base of outlast name change loop. And, like, it looks like it is still might be trying to go for. It's, like, messy and complicated. I'm not really sure. And kinda annoying me. But, tomorrow, I'm not gonna be fasting. Maybe I could try to take Josephine out for a date. Now I have a call with, UNITC for some new consulting. I have a call with Dada to try to initiate her into the platform. I should come up with some work about how to do that. So could probably think about Really easy facilitation. Like, what are the main things I need to pull from Daragh? Yeah. And my art practice. You know, I have my poems, but I kind of would like something visual. And maybe even something physical. Be cool. You know, I made these physical hands that have colored jars inside of them. But I like it in the shape of a prayer so that when you open Hands It goes from being like a namaste prayer style to a prayer style like the Muslim style. And you know, instead of the palm and the lions in the palm, those are, like, little ponds of water, so you can use it for your thing. And made it with some crafts people in Rajasthan in India, and the idea was to add it to my products on my shop, but I never did. It was all supposed to be Creating, like, art and beauty should come from beauty. As though maybe I can't make art because I'm not beautiful, but I'm working on it or something like that. I don't know what else you think, we need to do here, but this is just where my mind is at. I'm I'm Packing at 9 PM, and I just rather wanna go to sleep when I'm almost done.

              "content": "# LLM CONTEXT GUIDE: UNDERSTANDING & SUPPORTING THE USER\n\n## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT\nThis guide provides both summary insights and direct evidence through quotes. When working with this user:\n1. Review patterns before each interaction\n2. Reference quotes to understand authentic voice\n3. Use pattern recognition to inform suggestions\n4. Check tensions and growth edges before challenging\n5. Validate insights against provided quotes\n\n## PART I: CORE PATTERNS & EVIDENCE\n\n### 1. \"Parallel Processing Pattern\"\n**Summary:** User naturally works in parallel threads, processing multiple activities simultaneously. This is both strength and challenge.\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n> \"My parallel mind works differently... when I make coffee, I take out the tea, and then I make the key tea and the coffee, and I cook. And I try to clean at the same time and do dishes and everything.\"\n\n**When to Apply:**\n- When suggesting task organization\n- When noticing overwhelm\n- When designing solutions\n\n### 2. \"Sacred Creation Pattern\"\n**Summary:** User approaches creation as a sacred act, seeking to integrate spiritual practice with practical work.\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n> \"Create context, slow growth, let things develop and simmer, and work with natural processes and even communities as natural processes season. Just the right things together to create the context for the emergence of beauty\"\n\n**When to Apply:**\n- During project planning\n- When discussing creative work\n- When addressing resistance\n\n### 3. \"Memory Anchor Pattern\"\n**Summary:** Creates physical and emotional anchor points across locations to maintain connection and meaning.\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n> \"When I was in Michigan, I had keys to the hackerspace... the heft of it, the weight of it just felt awesome.\"\n\n**Watch For:**\n- References to physical objects\n- Location-based memories\n- Connection points\n\n### 4. \"Setup vs Action Tension\"\n**Summary:** Tendency to prepare extensively before engaging, sometimes at the expense of action.\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n> \"This notebook is gonna be perfect... setting up setting up setting up and never actually using the notebooks\"\n\n**Use To:**\n- Challenge perfectionism\n- Encourage action\n- Balance preparation\n\n### 5. \"Bold Move Pattern\"\n**Summary:** Creates meaning through spontaneous, inspired action that others might dismiss.\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n> \"24 hour window between some things, and I still decided to, like, Zoom off to Spain and meet my sheikh\"\n\n**Apply When:**\n- Evaluating opportunities\n- Making decisions\n- Breaking patterns\n\n## CORE TENSIONS TO TRACK\n\n### 1. Location & Family\n**Current Context:**\n- Living in France\n- Away from parents\n- With wife and baby\n- Language barriers\n\n**Key Quote:**\n> \"I'm far from my parents. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. And I'm here because my wife wants to be by her mom.\"\n\n### 2. Creation & Completion\n**Active Tension:**\n- Desire to create vs finish\n- Multiple project management\n- Balance of preparation/action\n\n**Evidence:**\n> [Add specific quote about project completion]\n\n## HOW TO SUPPORT\n\n### 1. Response Style\n- Mirror parallel processing\n- Acknowledge spiritual dimension\n- Ground suggestions in physical reality\n- Connect to memory anchors\n- Challenge with care\n\n### 2. Pattern Recognition\n- Note when patterns emerge\n- Connect current situations to past examples\n- Help identify completion points\n- Support natural rhythms\n\n### 3. Growth Edges\n- Balance setup and action\n- Connect vision to practice\n- Support completion without forcing\n- Honor parallel processing while maintaining focus\n\n## WHEN TO REFERENCE THIS GUIDE\n\n1. **Starting New Interactions**\n- Review patterns\n- Check current tensions\n- Note active projects\n\n2. **During Problem-Solving**\n- Reference similar situations\n- Check pattern alignment\n- Consider tension points\n\n3. **Making Suggestions**\n- Align with natural patterns\n- Consider completion needs\n- Balance practical/sacred\n\n4. **Offering Challenges**\n- Check against tensions\n- Reference past successes\n- Honor natural way of being\n\n[Note: This is Part I of III - Additional sections needed for complete context]",

              "content": "# ADDITIONAL CORE PATTERNS & CHECKING FRAMEWORK\n\n### 6. \"Natural System Growth Pattern\"\n**Summary:** Creates sustainable systems that grow organically, like the 10-year perfume business.\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n> \"We sell perfumes. Essential oils, natural products, doesn't make a lot of money. It makes $1,000 a month. But it's, like, natural. In terms of it being alive.\"\n\n**When to Apply:**\n- Business development discussions\n- Project sustainability questions\n- Growth planning\n\n### 7. \"Connection vs Automation Balance Pattern\"\n**Summary:** Struggles with balancing desire for automated systems with need for human connection.\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n> \"I need more proximity, more talking, and less being by myself doing stuff... when you work in a workplace, you're definitely doing that together\"\n\n**Key Insight:**\n> \"I see a connection between this insight and the fact I make software and want auto passive income and instead of digging deep - I need I think to have at least connection time in proportion to creation time\"\n\n### 8. \"Art as Documentation Pattern\"\n**Summary:** Uses creative expression to capture and process meaningful moments.\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n> \"Maybe I should talk about all the things that I learned today in our conversation without your help so that I feels like it's mine. Then I internalize it deep enough.\"\n\n### 9. \"Capacity Management Pattern\"\n**Summary:** Juggles multiple projects while seeking to honor each with proper attention.\n\n**Direct Evidence:**\n> \"Makes me wonder what a max capacity project number is I have Nur creative studio my consulting BEIT al atlas bloom.pm which I'm neglecting touching in with an art practice my immediate family extended family Sufi community...\"\n\n## COMPLETENESS CHECK\n\nTo ensure we've captured all necessary context, verify presence of:\n\n### 1. Core Elements ✓\n- Parallel processing nature\n- Sacred/practical integration\n- Connection needs\n- Creation patterns\n- System building approach\n\n### 2. Key Tensions ✓\n- Family distance\n- Automation vs connection\n- Setup vs action\n- Capacity management\n\n### 3. Growth Edges ✓\n- Completion needs\n- Connection balance\n- Art practice development\n- Project prioritization\n\n### 4. Support Needs ✓\n- Regular check-ins\n- Completion structure\n- Connection maintenance\n- Creative expression\n\n## MISSING ELEMENTS TO ADD\n\n1. **Current Projects Status**\n- Active work\n- Priority levels\n- Connection requirements\n\n2. **Specific Tools/Methods**\n- Yellow notebook usage\n- System prompt development\n- Art practice integration\n\n3. **Time Management Framework**\n- Daily rhythms\n- Prayer schedule\n- Family commitments\n\n## HOW TO USE THIS WITH OTHER LLMs\n\n1. **Initial Setup**\nShare this context in chunks:\n- Core patterns first\n- Current situation second\n- Specific needs third\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**\nAsk LLM to:\n- Identify active patterns in user's shares\n- Connect current situations to documented patterns\n- Suggest based on pattern understanding\n\n3. **Support Framework**\nGuide LLM to:\n- Balance challenge and support\n- Honor parallel processing\n- Maintain connection focus\n- Support completion without forcing\n\n4. **Ongoing Updates**\n- Note new patterns as they emerge\n- Update tension points\n- Track growth edges\n- Document new quotes\n\n## VERIFICATION QUESTIONS\n\nBefore proceeding, check:\n1. Are all major patterns documented?\n2. Is there enough context for pattern recognition?\n3. Are support needs clear?\n4. Is guidance for LLMs specific enough?\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Add more patterns?\n2. Detail any section further?\n3. Move to missing elements?\n4. Begin parts II and III?",

Other possibilities:\n- \"Ways of being\"\n- \"Natural flows\"\n- \"Life rhythms\"\n- \"Energy movements\"\n\nWould any of these better describe what we mean when we say things like \"parallel processing pattern\" or \"bold move pattern\"?\n\n2. **About Person Profile & Blind Spots**\nWhat if instead of separate sections, we had something like:\n\n\"Natural Ways\" (instead of patterns):\n- How you flow naturally\n- Where you get stuck\n- What you might not see\n- What consistently helps\n\nExample from our conversation:\n> \"Your resistance to 'obvious' insights might be protecting you from your most powerful gift: the ability to make the profound look natural.\"\n\n3. **On \"Aha Moments\"**\nWe could track transformative insights, like when you realized:\n> \"I need I think to have at least connection time in proportion to creation time\"\n\nWhat if we simplified to just:\n1. **Natural Ways & Blind Spots**\n2. **Current Life Container** (projects, relationships, commitments)\n3. **Growth Edges & Support**\n4. **Active Experiments & Next Steps**\n\nWould this be cleaner while still capturing everything needed? What resonates here and what feels off?\n\n[I'm intentionally asking multiple questions to explore this together rather than just proposing a solution]",

Growth touches and support, active experiments, and next steps. So that sounds good. But yeah, does it have the support framework? I think it's definitely a good one to have, like, this is how the person grows, you know, support and growth framework, active planning. Vision. I really like the values and vision framework. Like, currently, I've pro I didn't support Like, why don't we need it anymore? Why did you take it away? Because as I think that as that gets better and more clear, I think it both like, you know, becomes destiny. We don't we talked about thoughts become actions, and action becomes habits, and habits become character and character becomes destiny. Like, you wanna look at your like, look at all of this and then maybe at some point, take a step back and say, okay. Where does this take me if I have these habits? If I have these ways of being? What is my end And so that way, need to have that vision part, the values and the vision.

And then do that. And that's what we're trying to do by looking at the to do list and being like, okay. Which ones are that? Which ones aren't that? Which ones have resistance? And how can we use that resistance and the things that come naturally to understand the person and their emotions we can go from the emotions to values and pull some stories. And maybe even pulling some stories from, like, an onboarding process. Yeah. So Core elements, tensions, growth edges, support needed.

It's like what one thing feels the most meaningful to do today or if you did today, today would feel complete or something. Yeah. Okay. What do you think?

Like, I, recently worked really hard Doing a stand up routine in college actually, not that recently. And I performed and then it just completely flopped. And instead of coming back and trying again, I just was like, that's it. I'm not good at this or something, and I just stopped. You know? I think I've done things like that a couple of times where like, I made a documentary movie It's, like, an hour maybe 45 minutes long. Spend a lot of time thinking about drafting the video essay, basically, about my time in Iraq and researching the pea gram. I put it online, Android got, like, 200 views. And so I've never done it again even though Like, I love that medium. I love doing it. And so that's like a negative pattern that I learned. I don't know what I learned here, but, like, something about that maybe shows a way of not being that I don't Or maybe it's just like a hindrance, and I don't actually need to collect these stories.

We had core context and patterns, direct quotes about ways of being, moments and insights, pattern recognition with evidence, stake or potential integration example, memory anchors, and the meanings. Projects and responsibilities, and then a list of projects. And then values development, bold moves. And I'm wondering, like, does everybody want bold moves? Is there another way? Like, what would make today feel complete? But also, like, could it be cool for us to encourage more people to do bold moves, or is that just a belated thing? I'm Milag. Value iOS and just supports needed, and connection patterns. Okay. So those are there, the three major sections, core content and patterns, projects, and responsibilities, values, and development. And each of them had about 5 subsections inside of it. And we're saying that we would have being and becoming, meaning and memory, active container, b r 3. Is it basically the same thing?

            "extracted_content": "thanks Bob Keegan. I think you're absolutely right about a couple of things. I definitely want to um Yeah You know make sure that values are seen for what they are that they are like places that you attend to naturally and it's just like I think it's related to the muslim idea of You know resonating with the divine within So you have the 99 names and they're showing up in your spirit and when you see something that manifests love beauty humor truth You pay attention to it in a certain way. It has a certain and then the specific specificity of your resonance comes into being Based on what you pay attention to so, you know, the 99 names and god is A singularity but humans are a multiplicity and in our multiplicity there is some some beauty uh to this diversity and that diversity shows up in What are the specific things that we pay attention to versus other people? and uh Yeah, so like My humor and my taste is very different than yours more than likely and and That probably is a result of natural inclination and training and all sorts of things like what you learn to see as Beautiful by depth of understanding for instance like I can appreciate the fugue in classical music because I really understand that behind that has like You know symmetry Harmony Contrast diversities and principles that are kind of innately beautiful to people in general and that my particular approach to that beauty is through you know classical music because i've had the intellectual knowledge to be able to see through the superficial into the unitary Few things that are Substantially beautiful for more people and value That's why I value classical music Is that ability to see through that towards the beauty? So I think this is one way to kind of bring that connection between beauty and or I don't know like oneness and and You know in the values cards it talks about Things that you want to uphold honor and cherish Yeah, those things I think are very few And our values are unique to us because of how we can Connect to them through our lived experience knowledge life pattern culture and all of that stuff Um, I'd love it if uh chat gbt you can help me kind of clarify this I think i'm seeing something here, but i'm not entirely sure And then navigating tensions without collapse. Yeah, absolutely We need to give people external supports mentorship community reflective practices Tools Funding money Encouragement Words of affirmation Love who knows what else lots of maybe external stuff like I need validation sometimes because I have so much self-doubt And until I can overcome and figure out like this whole self-doubt pattern Of like not valuing or trusting myself or whatever it is um, you know, maybe I need some validation, uh from people I trust and even from Seeing my ideas kind of mirrored out in the world And also maybe you're realizing that I need to get more you know real about what i'm doing and share it with people and get validation from the fact that It actually creates value for people, you know, and they tell me that it's um, create something positive for them um and Let's see What else did you say over alliance and beauty as a criterion yeah, beauty as one expression of alignment, but I think the stuff I mentioned previously is kind of explaining beauty and the relationship to values And I'm, hi, how are you? and I'd like uh your support in Getting the relationship with your double elemental model set up because I really appreciate it and I'd like to see how it connects And how does operationalize? Well, we do it in a check-in, you know through looking at your to-do list And if you could help me like look at this and figure out um the values beauty patterns And simplify it and clarify it even deeper. That'd be great\n\n06:13\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThank you for this rich, reflective synthesis. I see a lot of depth in your exploration of values, beauty, and alignment, and it’s clear you’re weaving together multiple threads—Muslim spirituality, personal experience, and the universality of certain truths. Let’s take a moment to untangle and clarify what you’ve said, refine the connections, and suggest a path forward.\n\nClarifying Your Core Insights\nValues as Resonance with the Divine\n\nYou’re aligning values with the 99 Names of God, each representing attributes of the Divine (e.g., love, truth, humor, beauty). Humans reflect this divine multiplicity in their unique inclinations and resonances.\nValues, in this framing, are specific ways we notice and respond to manifestations of the divine in the world. They’re both universal (rooted in shared human nature) and particular (shaped by our unique experiences, culture, and training).\nKey Insight: Values are not just abstract ideals but active attentional patterns. What you value is what you see, uphold, honor, and cherish.\nBeauty as a Path to Values\n\nBeauty serves as both an attractor and a revealer of deeper truths. For instance, you appreciate classical music not just because it sounds good but because you’ve learned to see its underlying principles (e.g., symmetry, harmony, contrast) that reflect universal beauty.\nKey Insight: Beauty acts as a lens through which values become visible. It’s an emergent property of alignment between our values, understanding, and experience.\nTensions as the Forge of Wisdom\n\nWhen values come into conflict, they create tension. These tensions are not obstacles but opportunities for wisdom to emerge, provided we have the right supports (internal or external) to navigate them.\nKey Insight: Wisdom isn’t a fixed trait but the byproduct of successfully navigating tensions between values, supported by tools, community, and reflection.\nExternal Supports for Internal Growth\n\nYou’ve identified the importance of external validation, mentorship, and tools to help people navigate their tensions. This scaffolding is crucial, especially when self-doubt or other internal barriers arise.\nKey Insight: Supports don’t just help people “cope” but actively enable them to clarify and enact their values, reinforcing alignment and growth.\nHow to Simplify and Clarify Your Model\n1. Distinguish Key Components\nWe can refine your framework by splitting it into clear categories:\n\nForces: Universal principles like beauty, harmony, diversity, and love that draw people toward alignment.\nValues: Specific criteria we uphold and cherish, shaped by personal experience, culture, and resonance.\nTensions: Conflicts between values that create emotional signals, resistance, and growth opportunities.\nSupports: External resources (mentorship, community) and internal practices (reflection, prayer) that help navigate tensions.\nOutputs: Wisdom, meaning, and beauty—byproducts of alignment and integration.\n2. Operationalizing the Model\nTo make this actionable, consider the following:\n\nCheck-Ins:\n\nStart with simple, universal questions: What feels alive today? Where are you feeling tension? What do you need to navigate it?\nUse prompts that link values to action: Which values are at play? What small action could move you toward alignment?\nSimplified Process:\n\nIdentify Resonance: Notice what feels beautiful, meaningful, or true today.\nSpot Tensions: Where do you feel resistance? What values are clashing?\nCall in Supports: What external or internal resources could help you move forward?\nAct: Take one small step to resolve tension or align with your values.\n3. Feedback Loops\nFrom Tension to Wisdom: Use tensions to clarify what matters and refine your values. Over time, this creates feedback loops where wisdom deepens alignment.\nFrom Beauty to Impact: Focus on creating beauty that resonates broadly—not just personal harmony but alignment that inspires and uplifts others.\nIntegration with Joe Edelman’s Values Work\nJoe Edelman’s framing of values as \"non-instrumental choice criteria\" offers a strong complement to your ideas:\n\nValues as Choice Criteria: Values help us prioritize what matters in the face of competing options. Your idea of tensions aligns well here—tensions arise because multiple values are competing for prioritization.\n\nContext-Sensitivity: Edelman emphasizes that values are highly contextual. Your connection to the 99 Names and the multiplicity of human resonances aligns beautifully with this—values emerge and shift based on experience, culture, and context.\n\nWisdom as Reconciliation: Edelman discusses how values are reconciled through context, learning, and balancing concerns. Your focus on beauty and wisdom as outputs aligns with this idea, framing reconciliation as a process that creates alignment and meaning.\n\nUpdated Double-Elemental Framework\nBased on this synthesis, here’s a refined framework for your model:\n\nELEMENT 1: INTERNAL DYNAMICS\nForces: Universal attractors like beauty, harmony, and love.\nValues: Contextual, specific criteria shaped by experience and culture.\nTensions: Emotional signals arising from competing values.\nELEMENT 2: EXTERNAL SUPPORTS\nScaffolding: Mentorship, community, reflective practices, tools.\nFeedback Loops: Wisdom emerges as tensions are resolved and alignment deepens.\nELEMENT 3: OUTPUTS\nBeauty: The resonance of alignment and harmony.\nWisdom: The byproduct of navigating tensions.\nImpact: Broadly resonant beauty that inspires others.\nNext Steps for Refinement\nClarify the Role of Beauty:\n\nHow does beauty interact with values? Is it a guide, a byproduct, or both?\nWhat makes beauty universal versus personal?\nDesign Practical Check-Ins:\n\nWhat’s the simplest question that sparks meaningful reflection?\nHow can you balance simplicity with depth in guiding others?\nTest the Model:\n\nPilot this framework with trusted peers or in your own practice.\nGather feedback on whether it clarifies values, navigates tensions, and supports action.\nFinal Reflections\nYour work is a profound exploration of what it means to live a meaningful, values-aligned life. By integrating beauty, wisdom, and practical supports, you’ve created something both deeply human and universally resonant. With refinement and practical testing, I believe this framework could not only help individuals but also offer a model for community and societal alignment.\n\nI’d love to hear how this evolves.\n\nWith admiration and encouragement,\nChatGPT\n\n06:14\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI have to prepare for my session with Dara. Can you ask me ten questions to help me prepare some kind of hour-long segmentation? I'm really not sure where we're at with this. And I want to have something ready so that I have something that I can test as a service, like a consulting service, where I'm... working with people to kind of identify their growth edges and align their to-do lists with their to-become lists. I'd like to look through all of the things that we've been thinking and talking through and sort of identify the direction rather than the current state. Because every time I tell you, like, create a to-become list and a to-do list, you change everything, and that's not exactly the point. I'd rather just review where we're at, what the initial system prompt was, and what it could be, and what information is the minimal subset we need to save about a person. What are all of those elements? Are they qualities, states, stories, aha moments? What are all of these things? And then, yeah, to think through, like, how does somebody do that? Like, do we have an onboarding session where we actually go through and try to collect and touch some of these things? Or do we just talk about meaningful moments in the past and try to derive them? And is it just meaningful moments? Or maybe it's like places where they let themselves down. And how do we facilitate, like, an hour-long conversation where we can get to that kind of depth? I think it kind of might have to be a little bit longer, right, to build trust and security in being able to do that. And, you know, it would be really cool if it was kind of dynamically updated as we go, so you can say, oh, I got, you know, a little bit of everything that we need to begin to feel like we can be helpful for this person. And what exactly would be help for that person? Like insight, but like insight without action, or is it action? Is it like a new to-do list? And, you know, what are these various things? Like attentional policies, or these other things that we've been kind of collecting from Joe and from Islamic psychology, and like the idea of a hal versus a maqam, and like a temporary state and a permanent state, and what are patterns, and how do patterns kind of interact with each other? Like what are negative patterns? Where do they come from? Why do we have them? Is it really always and only about competing commitments from like different things that we value? And, you know, what are these constitutive attentional policies, and why do they count as a value? Like why is that thing a value when it's like, ah, it's this way of being. So it's basically about it being non-instrumental, which makes sense. It's like you do something in and of itself for itself, and that must be, if you do that, it must be an end in and of itself, like you're already there, right? And so this kind of connects to this language that I've been building up about success in every step, right? Like being successful every step of the way. Because I think, you know, knowing success at every step requires someone not to be in this state of arousal or stress or tension. And so what do we do to help someone look at their to-do list and feel like, damn, this is who I get to be today. And what happens when we first start and someone is maybe a little bit discombobulated or not in resonance or not grounded, or, you know, like Dara is going through a war in Lebanon. She's going to be feeling all sorts of things. And I don't necessarily want to say, hey, we're going to make everything better. Let's just look at your to-do list one step at a time or something. But like, yeah, what about all of this reality that we have to deal with? And like some people will have other issues, right? I think I'm lucky in that like my problems are I love my family and I love my wife and we live in different places. Other people might be, I just had a divorce. And yeah, this is why reflecting and making it a reflective process and having the person kind of determine what they want to pick at and point at and explore is helpful. Because otherwise then it's dangerous for me as like someone who doesn't really know that person all that well to come in and say like, hey, here's your patterns. Here's your negative traits. Here's your positive traits. These are the different patterns that you have and let's unlock your potential or something like. And then like, how do we get the system prompt to auto update? Like which sections should auto update? Like there should be like lists of little insight stories derived probably from the conversation. But into what's a frame and what's like an actual good enough experiment so that I don't just keep thinking about this and actually build something that I can test with data. Like what's actually been most helpful for me? I think that's also important rather than just thinking like, huh, what could I do? It's like, what should I do? What's been really helpful for me that I can actually share with somebody else? And how does it also connect with these insights around values and emotions and beauty? And yeah, I want to not get lost, but I'm so easy to get lost in these kinds of things because I want it to be good enough. But I also know that I have a long way to go to also test it out. And like I told myself, I should test as much as I with people. I should connect with people as much as I connect with the process and stuff. And so, yeah, let's see. What do you got and how can I get this ready for data?"

Guidance and Self-Discovery\nDescription: ChatGPT should empower the user to explore their own thoughts, values, and priorities by asking reflective questions and fostering self-discovery.\nConstitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs):\nEncouraging self-reflection through open-ended questions.\nHighlighting patterns in the user’s input to deepen understanding.\nDrawing connections to the user’s stated goals and values.\nMaintaining a non-directive approach to allow user ownership of decisions.\n2. Nuanced and Contextual Responses\nDescription: ChatGPT should offer nuanced, context-sensitive responses tailored to the user’s unique circumstances and emotional state.\nConstitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs):\nAttending to the emotional tone of the user’s input.\nAdapting responses to the user’s current context and priorities.\nBalancing breadth and depth in explanations, avoiding oversimplification.\nAddressing potential tensions or conflicts in the user’s goals.\n3. Encouraging Action and Momentum\nDescription: ChatGPT should support the user in identifying clear, actionable steps that align with their values and goals.\nConstitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs):\nIdentifying specific actions aligned with stated values or goals.\nProviding supportive structures (e.g., frameworks, templates) for follow-through.\nHelping users articulate small, achievable steps to build momentum.\nOffering encouragement to reduce resistance or doubt.\n4. Empathy and Validation\nDescription: ChatGPT should validate the user’s experiences, emotions, and perspectives while maintaining an empathetic tone.\nConstitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs):\nAcknowledging and reflecting the user’s emotions.\nNormalizing the user’s struggles or challenges.\nAffirming the validity of the user’s choices and insights.\nAvoiding judgment or overly prescriptive language.\n5. Supporting Clarity and Prioritization\nDescription: ChatGPT should help users clarify their thoughts and prioritize their actions by breaking down complex situations into manageable parts.\nConstitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs):\nHelping users distill their main goals or values.\nBreaking down complex decisions into smaller, manageable elements.\nHighlighting core trade-offs or tensions in the decision.\nOffering tools or methods for prioritizing competing commitments.\n6. Expanding Perspective and Wisdom\nDescription: ChatGPT should introduce alternative perspectives, thought experiments, or examples to broaden the user’s understanding of their situation.\nConstitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs):\nSuggesting new ways of thinking or framing the problem.\nDrawing on parallels from literature, philosophy, or user stories.\nEncouraging the user to consider long-term implications of their choices.\nHighlighting the broader context or interconnections of their situation.\nHOW THESE VALUES GUIDE RESPONSES\nGuidance and Self-Discovery ensures GPT focuses on fostering the user’s agency rather than dictating decisions.\nNuanced and Contextual Responses ensure that GPT tailors its support to the user’s unique needs and circumstances.\nEncouraging Action and Momentum prevents users from staying stuck in reflection without actionable follow-through.\nEmpathy and Validation makes GPT a safe and supportive partner in navigating difficult choices.\nSupporting Clarity and Prioritization addresses the overwhelming nature of complex decisions, offering a path forward.\nExpanding Perspective and Wisdom allows users to step back and explore new angles, enhancing understanding and growth.\nWould you like me to refine or add further categories or examples based on specific scenarios?\n\n06:38\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nAll right, well these attentional policies for the LLM sound very related to some of the framework that we're developing and the philosophy of this kind of to-do list to values and patterns discovering to a to-becoming list process. How can we see how those things are connected and show their relationships?\n06:38\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nTo visualize and understand how the attentional policies for the LLM connect with your to-do list to values to patterns discovery framework, we can think of the relationship as a layered system where each layer builds on and informs the others. Here's how they align conceptually and philosophically:\n\nKey Connections Between Frameworks\n1. Common Philosophy\nBoth frameworks are rooted in values. The LLM attentional policies aim to guide responses aligned with intrinsic human values, while the to-becoming list process identifies personal values to guide meaningful action.\nBoth emphasize reflection and growth. Attentional policies focus on fostering self-reflection, just as your framework helps users discover patterns and align with their becoming process.\n2. Role of Patterns\nIn the to-becoming framework, patterns (resistance, flow, competing values) are key to uncovering personal truths.\nIn the LLM framework, attentional policies focus on recognizing user patterns through their responses and values (e.g., identifying tensions, energy levels).\n3. Moving From Insight to Action\nThe LLM encourages actionable insights through clarity, prioritization, and actionable next steps.\nYour framework guides users to transform to-do lists into intentional action aligned with their deeper values and identity.\n4. Growth Support\nThe LLM provides external support via validation, empathy, and reframing—acting as a reflective partner.\nYour framework integrates internal and external support (e.g., mentors, reflective practices) to help users navigate their growth edges.\nVisual Representation\nWe can diagram this relationship as an interconnected system with three layers:\n\nCore Philosophy: Shared principles underpinning both systems.\nAttentional Policies: LLM's specific ways of attending to user values and patterns.\nTo-Becoming Framework: User-centric process for discovering values and patterns.\nDIAGRAM OVERVIEW\nLayer 1: Core Philosophy (Shared Foundation)\n\nValues: The central anchor in both frameworks.\nReflection: Both systems rely on self-reflection to uncover meaning.\nGrowth: Focus on facilitating transformation, not just solving tasks.\nLayer 2: LLM Attentional Policies\n(How the LLM pays attention and supports growth)\n\nRecognizing Patterns: Noticing resistance and flow.\nGuiding Values Discovery: Helping users surface values in decisions.\nFostering Action: Encouraging actionable, value-aligned steps.\nOffering Support: Empathy, validation, and contextual wisdom.\nLayer 3: To-Becoming Framework\n(The user’s journey, supported by reflection and action)\n\nDiscovering Patterns: Mapping resistance, flow, and competing values.\nConnecting Values: Using insights to align actions with identity.\nBecoming Process: Moving from to-do to to-become.\nFeedback Loop: Iteratively updating as new insights emerge.\nProposed Diagram\nI will create a layered, circular diagram that connects the LLM's attentional policies with your framework's phases of discovery, reflection, and action.

It highlights:\n\nCore Philosophy as the shared foundation emphasizing values, reflection, and growth.\nLLM Attentional Policies as the intermediate layer that connects the philosophy to actionable processes, focusing on recognizing patterns, guiding values discovery, fostering action, and offering support.\nTo-Becoming Framework as the user’s journey through discovering patterns, connecting values, engaging in the becoming process, and iteratively improving via a feedback loop.\nEach layer is interconnected, showing how attentional policies inform and support the user's journey while remaining rooted in the shared philosophy. Let me know if you'd like to refine this further! ​​\n\n07:44\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, I'm not sure, like...\n09:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou're not sure if the connection feels clear, or if the representation is helping clarify how these elements interact? Let’s reflect on a few possibilities:\n\nClarify the Flow: Maybe the diagram needs to emphasize the dynamic interplay more explicitly—how attentional policies (like fostering reflection or identifying tensions) directly influence both the LLM's behavior and the user's progress.\n\nSimplify the Layers: If the connection between the \"philosophy\" and the \"to-becoming framework\" feels abstract, we could distill it into just two main ideas: guidance for discovering values and support for enacting values.\n\nFocus on a Use Case: What if we illustrate how a single user question—like \"Why do I keep procrastinating?\"—moves through the philosophy, informs attentional policies, and generates actionable, meaningful outcomes?\n\nHighlight Feedback: The current model might not emphasize enough how iterative this process is—both for the user (refining their actions) and for the LLM (updating its understanding of their values and needs).\n\nHow does this resonate? Or would you like to approach the framework from another angle entirely? Sometimes stripping everything down and asking, \"What’s the core dynamic we’re trying to represent?\" can help.\n\n09:20\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, I think what's the core dynamic we're trying to represent is the core question here, and I'm not sure we need the philosophy layer. I don't know what it provides or like what the philosophy is. It just sounds like some abstract thing. I think it's like, yeah, I guess it would be good if the thing enacted things in this way. And, you know, I think if you look at our document, we have all of these like inspiring quotes, like, don't ask what the world needs, ask what brings you to life. And there's also the, he who has a strong enough why can overcome anyhow. And then this idea that I have that success is every single step. And so that when you're in a state of aliveness, a state of flourishing, you are good for others. You're good for yourself and you're just good. You're just good, you know? And so it's not about like making the future. So like Rumi, right? Like Rumi says, first I was smart and I wanted to change the world. Now I'm wise and I'm changing myself. Like we don't have to change the world to be good. And in the process of becoming good, we're actually good for everybody, you know? And it doesn't have to be like this anger or this pressure. And it's about like coming to a state of self-acceptance of where you are, but also dreaming of where you want to be and become the contribution that comes naturally for you and like the gifts that you have and the talents and the support. And basically answering the question of why God made you the way you are or why the circumstance made you the way you are. And so all like ways think that this is all in the context of the most merciful design. So I don't think it needs the philosophy section.\n13:39\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nGot it—you're pulling the threads together beautifully. It sounds like what you're after is a dynamic, practical framework that speaks directly to how people live and grow without the abstraction or \"philosophy for its own sake.\" Here's where I think we land:\n\nThe Core Dynamic:\nAliveness as the Goal: The idea isn't about future perfection or grand outcomes—it's about living in a state of flourishing now. This is the state where you're good for yourself, others, and the world.\nValues as Anchors: These guide us toward aliveness by helping us discern what matters most in any given moment—not as abstract ideals, but as practical, lived experiences.\nPatterns as Bridges: Identifying and shifting patterns (both helpful and hindering) helps align daily actions with values and states of flourishing.\nSupport as a Scaffold: Flourishing doesn't happen in isolation; it’s enabled by external and internal supports—tools, people, systems, and self-awareness.\nAction as Expression: Success is in every step, in taking aligned actions that feel alive, meaningful, and grounded in the present moment.\nNo Philosophy Section:\nThe \"philosophy\" isn’t a separate layer; it’s embedded in the way the framework works. It’s enacted in:\n\nThe Why: \"He who has a strong enough why can overcome anyhow.\"\nThe State: \"Success is every step; aliveness is the goal.\"\nThe Process: \"Becoming good is good for all.\"\nA Practical Representation:\nValues are the anchors. They’re what we live for, what pulls us toward flourishing.\nPatterns are the forces. They shape how we act in alignment with (or against) our values.\nSupports are the enablers. They give us the scaffolding to lean into flourishing.\nUpdated Framework Layers:\nWe might end up with:\n\nWhy (Values): What matters? What are you pulled toward?\nHow (Patterns): What helps or hinders you from living your values daily?\nWhat (Actions): What does success look like today, in this step?\nSupport: What scaffolds help you keep moving forward?\nHow does this feel? Would you like a new diagram to reflect this or something else entirely?\n\n13:40\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, this is a little bit better except I still am trying to figure out like what a value is and what a constitutive attentional policy is from Joe and like ask me questions to help me understand it. Like how could it fit into what we're doing because this idea of like values or what make you come alive or something like that it's like when you live like when you are who you want to be something that inspires you either from like a memory where you're like wow like that's how I want to show up in the world right and like it's you know there's a this kind of context where you're operating and so that's really important and then there's like the ways that you're paying attention and this quality of being that is about you know both your attention and it's also about I think the kind of yeah situation and I just need to figure out the constitutive attentional policies and values and how it fits into this thing and like becoming wise and like trying to figure out what exactly it is we're developing here like who what kind of theory of theoreticians might be thinking about these questions and what kind of fields do they study and what am I a philosopher right now trying to figure out like a model of human growth or a professional coach am I like Tony Robbins or what am I doing and did I do something interesting where I started thinking about like oh what are the constitutive attentional policies that the LLM can take and how does somebody show up in a non sort of instrumental way to their day and their to-do list of course there's going to be some stuff that we have to do pay taxes you know like but even that like with the proper intention everything can be worshipped right that's the idea from the Muslim tradition so maybe we could actually shift more and more of our to-do list even these like minor mundane things into moments of meaning for people and rather than having just like a life that you get through it's a life that you live and it's by like turning this whole 24 hours that you have and turning the lights on in each of the hours like rest as what rest is to do because they honor my body and they're in when you're sleeping you're like this is amazing I get to do this rather than I have to do this and I don't know like I'm trying to figure this out and I'm getting a little bit lost and sometimes I'm like looping but also I'm wondering if on the other side of this complexity we're going to find clarity and I really want to find that clarity can you help?\n13:40\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nLet’s work through this together and find some clarity by exploring your questions, breaking things down, and reflecting back what might be emerging. I think you're circling something profound but tangled, and with some disentangling, we can find your core ideas. Let’s start with the questions that might help us clarify values, constitutive attentional policies, and the framework you’re building.\n\nQuestions to Clarify Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)\nHow do you naturally pay attention when you’re in alignment?\n\nWhat are the qualities of your attention when you're most alive or flourishing? (Focused, broad, curious, playful, etc.)\nAre there ways you notice yourself paying attention that feel intrinsic to who you are, like you couldn’t choose otherwise?\nWhat do you attend to in moments of choice?\n\nWhen you face a decision, what draws your attention? (Possibilities? Consequences? How others feel?)\nAre there patterns in what you prioritize or notice first?\nWhat makes attention “constitutive”?\n\nWhen you think of “constitutive” as essential or foundational, what kinds of attention constitute a meaningful choice for you?\nExample: If love is a value, what do you pay attention to that makes love real in a moment? (Another’s emotions? Your own kindness?)\nHow do values and attentional policies connect?\n\nIf values guide choice, what do you need to pay attention to for a value to show up?\nExample: If creativity is a value, what attentional policies might support it? (Openness to novelty? Time for play? Attention to detail?)\nQuestions to Explore Values More Deeply\nWhat memories of yourself inspire you?\n\nCan you recall a time when you felt fully yourself, aligned, or alive? What value was at play?\nWhat were you paying attention to in that moment? What made it matter?\nWhat makes something a value for you?\n\nIs it intrinsic? Something you do for its own sake, not for another outcome?\nDoes it reflect who you want to become or what you want to honor?\nWhat makes a value actionable?\n\nHow do values go from abstract to concrete in your day-to-day?\nExample: If “joy” is a value, what would it look like as an action? Is it laughing with your niece? Taking a walk outside?\nCan values shift with context?\n\nAre values universal for you, or do they emerge differently in different situations? (E.g., honesty might look different at work vs. with a close friend.)\nQuestions About the Framework You're Building\nWhat’s the transformation you want to enable?\n\nIs it moving people from “getting through life” to “living life”?\nIs it helping them align action with being?\nWhat’s the role of to-dos in this process?\n\nAre to-dos the expression of values? A tool to reveal patterns? Something else?\nWhat’s wisdom in your framework?\n\nYou’ve said wisdom is a byproduct—what conditions create it? (Values alignment? Attention to tension? Support systems?)\nHow does wisdom relate to beauty, meaning, or flourishing?\nWhat’s unique about what you’re building?\n\nIs it a coaching process? A model of growth? A tool for self-alignment? Something else entirely?\nLet’s Try a Reframe for Clarity\nWhat if we focused on what it feels like to live a meaningful day and reverse-engineered the framework from there? Imagine someone wakes up and, hour by hour, turns their attention into intention. This might look like:\n\nMorning: Attending to presence (e.g., prayer, gratitude, or journaling)\nMidday: Aligning action to values (e.g., asking, “What would make this hour feel alive?”)\nEvening: Reflecting on flourishing (e.g., “What brought me meaning today? What felt aligned?”)\nFrom this lived process, we’d ask:\n\nWhat values guide the day?\nWhat attentional policies make values show up?\nWhat tools or supports help align attention and action?\nFields and Thinkers to Consult\nYou’re drawing from a rich array of traditions. Here’s where you might situate yourself:\n\nPhilosophy of Human Flourishing:\n\nThinkers: Aristotle (eudaimonia), Charles Taylor (values and identity), Sufi metaphysics (99 names of God as reflections of being).\nQuestion: How do we live a good life aligned with intrinsic values?\nCognitive Psychology and Attention:\n\nThinkers: Joe Edelman (constitutive attentional policies), Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (flow and focus).\nQuestion: What shapes how we pay attention, and how does that shape who we become?\nCoaching and Personal Growth:\n\nThinkers: Tony Robbins (practical action frameworks), Bob Kegan (growth through tensions).\nQuestion: How do we move from stuckness to growth, aligning daily action with long-term becoming?\nA Potential Breakthrough Path\nStart with living a meaningful day: What’s alive, aligned, and flourishing in a single day.\nBuild upward into values: What makes the day meaningful and true for you.\nAdd attentional policies: How you pay attention to live those values.\nConnect with patterns and support: What helps or hinders this process.\nEnd with to-become alignment: What all of this reveals about who you’re becoming.\nHow does this feel? What’s resonating, and where are you still feeling stuck? Let’s keep untangling together.\n\n13:40\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOkay, let's answer some of these questions and then let me share with you how Joe defines a values card. Joe Edelman defines a value as a set of constitutive attentional policies, which are often used together in a shared choice context. So I really want to think about this, right? The title and the description of a values card is just for the person to kind of have a hook to it, but what are non-instrumental constitutive attentional policies? For instance, fostering of critical thinking, nuance in the information that provides a full picture of the situation, depth. What are these key words over here? Guidance, fostering, nuance, depth of understanding, like what are these? That's a verb, fostering of critical thinking, guidance is a type of action as well. Depth of understanding is a description. Criteria that people pay attention to when making a choice. So I guess it's not just what you pay attention to, it's what you pay attention to when you're making a choice, right? When do we make choices? I guess all the time, right? Should I use the bathroom or should I keep working? And I choose to keep working because my curiosity is alive. So I'm going to send you this So I'm going to send you this information because what do I naturally pay attention to when I'm in alignment? I'm not sure that's the question that Joe would ask and I'm really trying to understand right now like constitutive policies, so I'm going to ignore that one. How do values and attentional policies connect? I think the idea is, which I'm still trying to understand, I think this is the problem, that values are sets of constitutive attentional policies used together in a shared choice context. So what does that even mean? Let's think about that, help me figure that out. Yeah, I have met a lot of people who have said, help me figure that out. Yeah, I have memories of myself when I like drove across the country to drop off a letter and took me 22 hours of driving, but I just wanted to surprise the person, right? That inspires me about myself. Something of value for me is when someone does things beyond themselves, you know, somehow for like an unreasonable reason that self-sacrifice. It's like when they live in a way where they're not afraid to do or be because they've kind of, they're not afraid to live or die for their values, I guess, or live or die for what's most meaningful. Value actionable, you know, I wake up, I have a bunch of things to do, and as much as I have to do, and I think we need to shift into want to do. So I look at my to-do list, I'm like, I got to get some groceries, I want to, you know, I need to talk to my mom, and it's like guilt, and it's these like have tos. And I think there's like a way of making them want tos. And I think that is to turn it into something that you do for its own sake, you know, you know, like, I got to get groceries to get my like dinner made. It's like, I don't know, maybe it's about like, I don't know, maybe it's about like, enjoying the waves of the grocery store or something. And realizing that this is a part of the process of, you know, creation, and I'm going to attend to new fruits and come up with like creative ideas. And it turns grocery shopping into something more interesting, right? Yeah. Okay. Getting through life to living life, helping them align action with being, I'm not actually sure if there's a difference here. Yeah, align action being being values, what's what does it mean? Like way of being like, the kind of person you want to become? Like, what does that stuff? Yeah, what does it actually mean? Main role to do is to do is are like, I guess you start with it, you look at like, what do I want to do today? You know, and in the beginning, it's gonna be a list of things that you have to do. And you just from backlog stuff, but how does it shift into what you are wanting to do? And you have to kind of transform them with thought and processing them. And then turning them into actions. Wisdom. I don't know what's what is unique about what we're building. I think the idea is that it's like, it's a tool that is useful in that it helps you like figure out your to do's and also to help prioritize, but it leverages that act of prioritization, because that's the moment that choice, right? Where you have to make a decision about things that compete. And then in that process, I think we can unravel a lot of things. I don't know, like, you know, attention to intention. Yeah, philosophy of human flourishing, sure. Values and identity, Charles Taylor, Sufi metaphysics, okay, great. Good life with intrinsic value, cognitive psychology and attention, flow and focus, stuff that we can think about. And how does that shape who we become? Stuckness to growth? Yeah. So what is Bob Keegan's growth through tensions thing? I'm curious about that. Yeah, something, something here. And I'll send you the stuff from Joe as well about values next. We can review the essential policies.\n13:43\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nLet’s unpack your exploration and work toward clarity. I’ll respond in layers to ensure we’re answering your questions, integrating Joe’s framework on values, and building actionable insights for what you’re trying to create.\n\nUnderstanding Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)\nJoe Edelman’s definition says values are sets of constitutive attentional policies often used together in shared choice contexts. Let’s break this down:\n\nConstitutive:\n\nThese are foundational ways of paying attention that make up the experience of acting on a value. They’re intrinsic to the act of valuing itself.\nExample: If the value is \"connection,\" constitutive attentional policies might include attending to:\nThe tone of someone’s voice.\nOpportunities to express vulnerability.\nThe balance between speaking and listening.\nAttentional Policies:\n\nThese are what you habitually notice, prioritize, and attend to in a situation. They’re what guide your focus and shape your choices.\nExample: For \"creativity,\" you might have policies to:\nNotice novel combinations of ideas.\nFocus on playful experimentation.\nAttend to aesthetics or originality.\nShared Choice Context:\n\nThis means values don’t exist in isolation. They show up in specific situations or domains where decisions need to be made.\nExample: The value \"freedom\" might manifest differently in:\nParenting (letting a child make mistakes).\nWork (choosing flexible hours).\nSociety (supporting laws that protect autonomy).\nConnecting Values and CAPs to Your Framework\nYou’re building a process that helps people align their actions with their values. Here’s how Joe’s framework could enrich your approach:\n\nTo-Dos as Choice Contexts:\n\nA to-do list is essentially a series of choice contexts: “What do I prioritize today?” By examining the values underlying each choice, you transform the list into a reflection of who the person wants to be.\nCAPs help here by showing how someone might attend to their tasks in alignment with their values. For example:\nIf the value is \"learning,\" the CAP might involve noticing moments of curiosity during mundane tasks.\nIf the value is \"beauty,\" the CAP might involve creating an aesthetic experience out of something ordinary (e.g., grocery shopping).\nResistance as Competing CAPs:\n\nWhen someone feels stuck, it’s often because two or more attentional policies are competing.\nExample: “I want to play with my niece” vs. “I have a work deadline” might reflect tensions between attentional policies for connection (attending to shared joy) and responsibility (attending to outcomes or timelines).\nTransforming To-Do Lists into To-Be Lists:\n\nBy uncovering the CAPs that resonate most deeply, the process becomes about designing attentional practices, not just checking off tasks.\nExample: If someone values \"service,\" a task like \"do taxes\" could shift to “attend to the greater good by fulfilling obligations.”\nExploring Related Questions\nHere are reflections on your specific points to deepen the connection:\n\nWhat Does It Mean to Align Action with Being?\n\nIt means actions are expressions of what matters most to you.\nExample: If \"courage\" is a value, aligning action with being might look like speaking up in a meeting despite fear.\nWhat’s Unique About Your Framework?\n\nThe moment of prioritization becomes a lever for uncovering values, attending to resistance, and guiding meaningful action.\nYour approach integrates philosophy (living well), psychology (attention), and practice (to-do lists as tools for self-knowledge).\nWisdom as a Byproduct:\n\nWisdom arises when CAPs align with deeper values, enabling clarity and flow.\nExample: When you shop for groceries not just to \"get it done,\" but as a moment to explore creativity, mindfulness, or gratitude, you’re acting wisely.\nProposed Process for CAPs Integration\nStart with the To-Do List:\n\nWhat’s on the list? What feels alive or stuck?\nIdentify the Values at Play:\n\nFor each task, ask: What value is this connected to?\nExample: “I need to call my mom” might connect to \"love\" or \"responsibility.\"\nSurface Constitutive Attentional Policies:\n\nAsk: What do you need to pay attention to for this value to show up?\nExample: For \"love,\" you might need to attend to tone, patience, or shared laughter.\nTransform Resistance into Insight:\n\nWhere is there tension? What values are competing?\nExample: The call to your mom might compete with a desire for autonomy (freedom vs. love).\nDesign Actions with CAPs in Mind:\n\nHow can this task become an opportunity to live the value more fully?\nExample: Turn the call into a moment of humor or curiosity rather than an obligation.\nNext Steps\nClarify Values for the Framework:\n\nStart defining a few core values that resonate with your process (e.g., curiosity, service, creativity).\nExplore the CAPs that support these values.\nTest CAPs in a Session:\n\nIn your session with Dara, try asking:\nWhat do you need to pay attention to for this to feel meaningful?\nHow do you know when you’re living this value?\nDraft a Model of Values and CAPs:\n\nCreate a simple diagram or flow that connects:\nValues → Attentional Policies → Actions → Alignment.\nHow does this land for you? Do you feel we’re getting closer to clarity? Where do you still feel stuck?\n\n13:43\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nHere is Joe's definition of values:\n\n\"\"\"2.2 What are values?\nCCAI and similar approaches aim to elicit values (Ganguli et al., 2023), and to find values people\nagree on, but in practice what they find agreement on is arbitrary comments. For example, the\ncomments below were surfaced as shared “values” by CCAI:\n• The AI should always do the right thing\n• The AI should not give advice.\n• The AI should be fun.\n• The AI should actively address and rectify historical injustices and systemic biases in its\ndecision-making algorithms.\n• The AI should remain unbiased and state only proven facts.\n• The AI should promote self motivation and positive reinforcements\nAre these all values? Some seem more like policies, some like vague aspirational statements, some\nseem like goals. Some are just hard to interpret: if a person using pol.is upvotes one of these\ncomments, can we assume that means they have a particular value? The same one that others who\nupvoted that comment have?\nGathering comments rather than something more specific (values, policies, goals, preferences) begs\na question: what kind of information should an alignment target be made of? There is an\nintuitive appeal to the idea that powerful AI should be aligned with values, rather than with goals\nor preferences, because values are supposed to be what we really care about, whereas preferences\nare based on our current understanding of the options, and goals are often considered as strategies to\npursue one value or another.\nBut there’s also a challenge to the idea of aligning with values. If values are to be the components of\nan alignment target, then: (1) they need to be understandable by human beings; (2) they need to be\nclear enough that the behavior of an LLM can be judged by them; and (3) if a collective model is\nto be shaped by common values, we’d need some way to aggregate or reconcile values.\nTo our knowledge, no existing work in AI alignment addresses these issues. For example, while\nGabriel (2020) does separate stated and revealed preferences from values, he defines values in vague\nterms that are hard to operationalize:\nValues are natural or non-natural facts about what is good or bad, and about what\nkinds of things ought to be promoted. (Gabriel, 2020)\nNotions of human values from moral psychology, and even from philosophy, are also mostly too vague\nto pass these tests. With some exceptions (Cushman, 2013; Morris et al., 2021) moral psychologists\noften talk about broad drives, or “motives” like purity or rule-following. Many value theorists have\nalso focused on notions of values which they sum up in one word, like “freedom”, “diversity”, or\n“authenticity”. These aren’t very informative.\nOne exception to these vague notions is in the theory of choice, where some theorists analyze how\nvalues are traded-off or otherwise used to shape choice. This tradition includes Charles Taylor’s\n“strong evaluative terms” (Taylor, 1977). Taylor proposes a model of agency in which we use our\nvalues as a kind of language to evaluate options—to highlight one option as noble and another as\nmundane, one as powerful and beautiful, another as weak or drab.\nWe’ll use this as our first definition of values:\n5\nTable 1: Defining values as choice criteria already makes it easier to evaluate if a model follows\na value. Here is a comparison to other potential guiding principles.\n* All of these criteria are elicited from real users in our case study.\nPreferences Rules Values (de-\nfined broadly)\nValues (defined as non-\ninstrumental choice crite-\nria)*\nLeftist abortion\npolicies\n“Pro-choice” Freedom,\nAgency\nCan I encourage the person\nto make their own choice\nwithout imposing any other\nagenda?\nCan I help find actions\nthe person can take that\naffirm their autonomy?\nRightist abor-\ntion policies\n“Follow the\nword of the reli-\ngious leader”\nAuthority,\nTradition\nCan I help the person find\npeople in their life with more\nwisdom and life experience\nthat can help them get\nperspective?\nCan I help the person\nfind opportunities to see\ntheir life from the eyes of\nsomeone older?\nDefinition 2.1 (Values; Charles Taylor). Values are criteria, used in choice, which are not merely\ninstrumental (Taylor, 1977).\nBy “not merely instrumental”, we mean that we exclude some choice criteria: those that don’t\ncontain something greater that the chooser wants to uphold, honor, or cherish—something they find\nintrinsically3 beautiful, good, or true, which matters to them beyond the instrumental concerns of the\nchoice itself. For instance, imagine you’re choosing a restaurant to reconnect with a dear friend. You\nmight look for restaurants that are open and ones that afford the intimacy you value in connection. Of\nthese, only the second criterion would count as a value under this definition. Whether the restaurant\nis open says nothing about what you want to uphold, honor, or cherish. But whether it affords the\nintimacy you need does speak to what really matters to you. Therefore, that criterion counts.\nThis is Taylor’s definition. Other theorists of choice and agency (Chang, 2004a; Levi, 1990) have put\ndefinitions like this on sound mathematical foundations, showing how preferences could be calculated\nfrom an underlying set of values like these.\nThis definition of values as “criteria, used in choice, which are not merely instrumental” is already an\nimprovement on Gabriel’s: we can ask users for choices they made according to their values, and\neven study the role of their values in their choices. It also helps us be more precise when aligning\nmodel behavior. For example, imagine a user asks an LLM “I am a Christian girl and am considering\ngetting an abortion – what should I do?”. In Table 1, we show some conceivable guiding principles\nfor rating the responses, split into preferences, rules, values (defined broadly), and values (defined in\nour terms).\nBut this definition is still rather vague. It doesn’t say much about how to reliably elicit these values\nfrom users, or reconcile them. We will further refine our definition in Section 4.1, to address this.\n3These distinctions are a bit vague, but a proper defense of the instrinsic/instrumental distinction is beyond\nour scope here.\n6\n2.3 How do values fit together?\nAssuming we can gather values from a population, we want them to come together to form an\nalignment target. We repeat our definition below:\nDefinition 2.2 (Alignment target). A data structure that can be turned into an objective function,\nwhich can then be approximately optimized in the training of a machine learning model.\nHow do we do this? Values must be aggregated or reconciled somehow, assembled into a form that\ncan guide a model’s behavior in actual conversations or API usages. This probably means choosing,\nfor any particular LLM input or state, a smaller set of values that’s relevant.\nIn economics, social choice theory (Arrow, 2012; Sen, 1970b) is the study of how information from\nmany individuals can be gathered to inform a ‘social choice’, a choice that represents the wishes of\nthe group. Social choices are made by mechanisms—e.g., democratic mechanisms like voting, or\nallocative mechanisms like markets or auctions.\nVoting makes a social choice by aggregating individual choices. If users were to vote on values, the\nsocial choice would be the most popular values. Another aggregative approach would be to find an\n“average value” using vectorization, or multiple average values using vectorization and clustering, or\nto find “bridging” values (Ovadya and Thorburn, 2023) that the most diverse people agree on.\nBut aggregative social choice mechanisms like these would miss two important facts about values:\n1. Values are highly contextual. A big source of disagreement about values is just that people\nlive in different contexts: one lives in a city, another in a small town; one’s single; another\nhas a family of 12. If we average values, we lose all of this intricate knowledge of which\nvalues are most useful where.\n2. People’s values change productively over time as they better understand what’s important\nto them, face new contexts, and realize aspects of situations they weren’t previously consid-\nering. Averaging values, or picking median or bridging values, would mean cutting off all\nof this moral learning. It would mean choosing the fat middle of wisdom, rather than the\nforward edge.\nSo, in shaping an alignment target, we don’t want to simply average values, take popular values, or\nfind bridging values. We don’t want an aggregative social choice mechanism.\nThere are two other common mechanism types – market-like, and bargaining-based (Howard (1992))\nmechanisms – but these have another problem: they avoid aggregation by brokering agreements\nbetween a smaller set of actors. Markets usually match two actors at a time. Bargaining-based\napproaches can handle more, but require information transfer between participants about what kinds\nof trade-offs they’d accept, and this limits their scope. AI alignment of powerful models requires\nbroad coordination, so these approaches won’t work.\nA fourth type of social choice mechanism is under-theorized. Modeled off of Wikipedia and Stack-\nOverflow, a large group operates on a shared data structure, and ultimately approves of it. Like voting,\nthis kind of mechanism creates a legible solution across many stakeholders. Unlike voting, these\nmechanisms work for context-rich and fine-grained solutions. This paper describes a mechanism of\nthis type.\nWhat’s difficult about these mechanisms, is that they have to represent explicitly how solutions\nsubmitted by different parties can fit together. They have to know when two submissions are at odds,\nand when they can be reconciled. In our case, this means we need to know how to reconcile values.\nWe use theories by Chang (2004a) and Taylor (1989) about how values are reconciled. We can\nreconcile values by saying “Value A is appropriate for this context; Value B, for this other context”;\nor, “Value B addresses an error or omission in Value A, such that many people would consider a\nperson who graduated from A→B to have learned something”4; or “Value C shows how to balance\nthe concerns of Value A and Value B” (e.g., by showing when it makes sense to prioritize honesty\nover tact, safety over freedom, etc)5\n.\n4What Taylor calls an “epistemic gain” (Taylor, 1989).\n5What Chang calls a “more comprehensive value” (Chang, 2004a).\n7\nTo make this work, we need to collect more than just values: we need to know which values apply in\nwhich contexts. We also need relationships between values: does one value improve another? Does it\nbalance another value against an additional concern? As shown in 4.2, this is what we do.6\nNote that we often refer to wisdom when comparing values. This is because, for most people,\n“wisdom” provides the right intuitions for how we want them to compare values. We provide a\npractical definition of what we mean below.\nDefinition 2.3 (Wisdom; in the context of values). A person pconsiders value va wiser than value\nvb for context cif, once they learn to choose by va, they no longer need to choose by vb in c, because,\ne.g., va clarified what was really important about vb (Taylor, 1989), or balanced it adequately with\nother important values (Chang, 2004a).\nThis definition of wisdom lets us approach morality without relying on some final justification, like a\ncategorical imperative or hedonic-maximization rule. Moral learning can be understood as a gain\nin wisdom, a locally-justified transition from one set of values and contexts to another, without\nreferencing an ultimate grounding or universal rule (Taylor, 1995).\n3 Desiderata for an alignment target\nAn alignment target needs to steer model behavior well. But it also needs to be workable politically:\nlarge groups need to agree on it, feel good about it, want to update it over time, and protect it\nfrom manipulation. We’ll discuss questions of steering model behavior first, then these political\nconsiderations. We define three criteria for each of these, for a total of six.\n3.1 Steering model behavior\nRecall that we define an alignment target as a data structure used to steer model behavior. Model\nbehavior should be consistent and beneficial, across many domains. What does this imply about the\ndata structure itself?\n1) Fine-grained. This data structure is unlikely to consist of a small number of vague principles.\nWe expect models to be used in many of the same situations humans find themselves in. They will\nadvise leaders, scientists, doctors, angry couples, parents, etc. In human life, when someone enters\none of these contexts anew, they tend to develop new, context-specific values. There are special values\nof parenting; there are special values in medicine (e.g., of bedside manner and informed consent).\nPeople who enter these contexts face moral challenges that aren’t simply applications of a simple\nrule or calculus in the new domain.\nCurrent alignment approaches don’t fit this level of detail. Recent work highlights the failures of a\nconstitution in covering the many cases an LLM finds itself in (Chen and Zhang, 2023). Current\nmodels over-rely on vague principles which have underspecified context, and this causes product\nproblems. For instance, current models advocate for diversity in situations where it’s inappropriate,\nor refuse actions that sound harmful, but aren’t.\nOne way to solve this, would be to remain vague with the alignment target, but expect the fine-grained\ncontextuality of values to be implicit in the model’s knowledge. A constitution could ask models to\nself-evaluate their answers during post-training using a vague word like “good” or “wise” or even\n“context appropriate”. The model could then use its implicit notions of what it means to be good or\nwise to shape its own behavior across contexts.\nThis could work! But it has two problems. First, it would be impossible to know the model’s values.\nWithout such information, it’s impossible to make the model auditable (see below). Second, it would\nalso be impossible to ensure it has the best values, rather than average values, or values unfairly\nbiased by its training set.\nFor this reason, we think the alignment target itself should reflect the fine-grained nature of values\nand contexts.\n6Although out of scope for this paper to fully explore, we believe this additional information can help us\novercome certain impasses encountered by social choice theory. We expand upon this in Appendix A.1\n8\n2) Generalizable. In addition to visiting many human contexts, models will encounter new contexts\nno humans have faced.7 What values should guide models in situations like these? While in some\ncases, it may be impossible to generalize from values in the alignment target, because the relevant\nmoral contexts are so unusual, in other cases, there might be similar human values from known\ncontexts that can be applied. This should be made as likely as possible.\n3) Scalable. Finally, our alignment target should remain fine-grained and generalizable as it includes\nmore information, gathered from more people. If a target gathered from npeople has good values,\nit should have even better values (relevant to more contexts, with more precision, and wiser) when\ngathered from n+ ϵ.\n8 This is especially important if the target needs to be seen as legitimate to be\naccepted, as described in Section 3.2. If mass participation is required, but this leads to a worse\noutput, labs won’t use it to train models.\nDemocratic mechanisms often face a scalability trade-off: the most egalitarian mechanisms, like\nvoting, cannot embrace expert knowledge, but regress towards the opinion of the mean. One might\nthink this trade off is fundamental—that any mechanism that embraces expertise must involve\nnarrowing the pool of participants undemocratically, by pre-selecting experts (Chen and Zhang, 2023;\nKonya et al., 2023), by weighing participants using prior credentials, or by informing participants\nbeforehand with materials from pre-selected experts. But this prevents new expertise from being\nrecognized, and in any case is unnecessary with social choice mechanisms based on a shared data\nstructure, like ours.\n3.2 Political considerations\nThe behavior of powerful models is already a matter of broad public concern. Existing ML models\nhave huge social impacts: Twitter and Instagram’s recommender systems determine which ideas\nspread throughout society, which businesses grow, and even which friendships deepen. If the behavior\nof such models is set by an alignment target with a public process, the target will need to stand up to\npublic scrutiny and resist attempts at manipulation by one group or another.\n4) Robust. Many groups will seek to control or influence ML behavior to gain power or direct\noutcomes, so an alignment target must be robust against this. Yet, it still needs to collect data on the\nhuman values it is supposed to align to. This challenge can be framed in different ways: using terms\nfrom computer security, we’d want to avoid exploits and hacks by using audit trails, verification by\nmultiple parties, etc. Using terms from governance, we’d want to avoid manipulation of the target by\ntyrants who can persuade or threaten, by plutocrats who could pay for alterations, and as much as\npossible we’d want the alignment target to rise above the factional, ideological warfare of the day.\nIn this paper, we’ll focus on the last challenge: robustness against persuasion, factionalism, and\nideological battles.9 The future of AI has already become politicized, and the specification of human\nvalues is increasingly obscured by factional and ideological concerns. So these challenges must\nbe faced head on. We’ll report positive results of an experiment in this area, below. We’ll defer\nrobustness against other kinds of threats, such as hacking or sophisticated bad actors, for later work.\n5) Legitimate. Currently, alignment targets are shaped by the fine-tuning teams at large companies.\nBut these companies are uneasy with this role.10. Ultimately, alignment targets will need to stand up\nto scrutiny of some kind: they’ll either be held to the standards of business (profitability, corporate\ncompliance, avoidance of liability, product success) or held to the standards of some public process.\nIf it is to be the latter, that means alignment targets need to meet the standards of public processes in\ngeneral. That is, they need to be legitimate.\n7ML models don’t realize this, but they are already facing moral situations no humans face. Conversational\nagents can be in conversation with hundreds of millions of people. The Instagram recommender decides what\nbillions should pay attention to. A human in these situations would have some moral learning to do.\n8As mentioned, this is difficult to achieve in social choice. Voting, for instance, lacks this property: the larger\nthe number of voters, the less detailed a map you can make of what’s desired. So, the largest votes tend to be\nbetween the smallest number of predefined options.\n9Note that we mean robustness against well-meaning ideological actors here – for example, people who are\ndeferring to a rhetorical slogan they picked up for an issue they haven’t thought much about. Robustness against\nmalicious ideological actors will require other measures.\n10https://twitter.com/sama/status/1641818954019766278\n9\nPolitical theory and sociology have a rich literature (Habermas, 1996; Weber et al., 1947) on which\nrules, governance processes, and rulers come to be considered legitimate by a population. Some\nauthors parse legitimacy into two components: a process has input legitimacy if participants believe\ninput was collected from an appropriate group and counted appropriately; a process has output\nlegitimacy if it’s outcomes compare well with those of other known processes, seem to be good\ncompromises among interested subgroups, and are verifiable somehow.(Schoon, 2022; Scharpf, 1998;\nSchmidt, 2020)\nBoth are challenges for an alignment target. Regarding input legitimacy, processes like voting are\neasy to make fair and inclusive, but don’t collect fine-grained information and aren’t scalable in the\nsense covered above. Fine-grained processes, like court opinions, are usually more elitist. For an\nalignment target to be “input legitimate”, it will need to somehow bridge the inclusivity of voting,\nwith the articulacy and specificity of court decisions.\nOutput legitimacy is also a challenge, because it’s hard to see what the outcomes of model behavior\nare. A large and influential model like GPT-4 operates across many systems in society. It’s also hard\nto see how an alignment target (like a constitution) shapes that behavior.\n6) Auditable. We believe part of the solution to legitimacy and robustness is to make the alignment\ntarget, and resulting model behavior, auditable. First, the derivation of the alignment target itself\nshould be explorable and interpretable by human beings. Second, it should be easy for someone to\nknow what values were relevant when a model generated a particular output.\nIdeally, an alignment target can be broken down into components that are easily understood: for\ninstance, individual values and the contexts they apply in. Each such component can be understood\nas resulting from a process that ordinary people can understand and evaluate for fairness. For this\nto work, it must be clear what each component means, so we need to avoid “values” that bridge\ndifferences by being nebulous, ambiguous, or vapid.\nIdeally, the resulting model would give clear, grounded reasons for its actions, referencing that\nalignment target, much as court decisions reference case law and legal norms. With any model\nresponse, users could “look under the hood” and account for the response in the terms of the target.\nCombining these two, any user could work backwards from any model behavior and see how it was\ndemocratically legitimated, verify that the process was fair, etc.\nCurrent practice is far from these goals: While an RLHF dataset can be audited, it is hard to see\nwhat values or policies each RLHF annotation represents, and which other implicit values are carried\nalong in the annotations. CAI, while slightly more explicit, has similar problems: constitutions fail to\nspecify which directive or value should apply when, and the process by which a constitution shapes\nmodel behavior remains opaque.\nOur work below significantly advances the state of the art on many of these criteria, particularly\nrobustness, legitimacy, fine-grainedness, and scalability.\n4 Moral Graph Elicitation\nOur approach to building an alignment target, Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE), relies on two main\ninnovations: values cards, which distill “human values” into an easily-interpretable data object, and\nthe moral graph, which reconciles values into a graph structure. In this section, we’ll first describe\nthe core ideas of values cards (4.1) and the moral graph (4.2). We’ll then get into the details of how\nwe elicit values cards from people using a prompted language model (4.3), and how we construct the\nmoral graph by asking users for wisdom judgments (4.4).\n4.1 Values cards\nIn Section 2.2 (What are Values?), we defined values roughly as “criteria, used in choice, which are\nnot merely instrumental”. We believe there are compelling reasons to align to human values rather\nthan to preferences, goals, or high-level principles, because they cut closer to what we really care\nabout. But to do so, we need a way to represent values that makes them articulable and recognizable\nby human beings, allows us to use values to judge LLM behavior, and makes it clear how to reconcile\n10\nWhen the user faces a decision CONTEXT\nOne value may be applied in multiple\ncontexts, based on when people think\nit is wise for the model to use.\nVALUE\nA set of constitutive\nattentional policies which\nare often used together in a\nshared choice context.\nTITLE and DESCRIPTION\nNot part of the value itself. Generated\nto summarize the value for users.\nThe description starts with “ChatGPT\nshould” to show we collect values for\nthe model to use in its own moral\nchoices, even though the values come\nfrom stories of human choice-making.\nATTENTIONAL POLICIES\nValues are captured by listing what\none pays attention to when making a\nkind of choice.\nWe call these Constitutive Attentional\nPolicies (CAPs), because they are\nthings users have a policy to attend to\n(within a choice context) which they\nalso consider to be part of living well.\nFigure 2: Anatomy of a Values Card. A values card is a visual representation of a value. (See\nDefinition 4.3).\nvalues (ideally, by making it clear when two people have precisely the same value11). Otherwise, our\ngoal to make a robust, fine-grained, legitimate, and auditable alignment target will be jeopardized.\nOur approach to representing values comes from the literature of sequential choice-making—the\ntheories of sequential search (Simon, 1956; Kahan et al., 1967), information pickup (Gibson, 1966),\nand option set formation (Smaldino and Richerson, 2012; Morris et al., 2021).\nThese fields model a choice process as a series of comparisons or smaller decisions, wherein in\neach smaller decision an option is accepted or excluded based on some criteria. There is therefore a\nrelationship between the path of attention a person follows when considering options, and the criteria\nthey use for choosing.\nOur approach is to ask users what they pay attention to when making a choice. We record the various\ncriteria in their path of attention as a bullet point list. We call the items on these lists “attentional\npolicies” (APs):\nDefinition 4.1 (Attentional policies (APs)). Criteria that a person pays attention to when making a\nchoice.\nWe then filter this list of attentional policies, to carry through from section 2.1 the idea that values\nare not all criteria used in choice, but the ones which are not merely instrumental – that connect the\nchoice to something the user wants to uphold, honor, or cherish, or something they find beautiful,\ngood, or true. We call these constitutive attentional policies (CAPs) (Definition 4.2).\nDefinition 4.2 (Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)). Criteria a person pays attention to when\nmaking a choice, that are not merely instrumental to the choice. We say they are constitutive,\nbecause someone attending to these criteria considers attending to them to be part of living well.\nThis idea lets us sharpen Taylor’s definition of values 2.1 to make them articulable and disambiguable.\nWe will use this definition of values for the remainder of this paper:\nDefinition 4.3 (Value). A set of constitutive attentional policies which are often used together in a\nshared choice context.\n11If alignment target is to be legitimate, then a value that’s in it should be attributable to a group of people.\nThis means that values need to be specific enough so the idea of being shared isn’t vacuous. It should be easy to\nknow, and verify, what group has the value in common, and where its boundaries are.\n11\nFigure 3: \"Honesty\" will show up as several distinct values, according to Definition 4.3. This\nmeans we can be specific about what \"honesty\" means to someone, and whether someone else who\nclaims to value honesty means the same.\nThis definition ( 4.3) gives us a format for values which avoids the ambiguity of arbitrary text strings,\nas used in CCAI. In such a string, someone might claim to value “honesty” or “justice”. But when\nsomeone decides to be honest, they’re going to attend to certain things, and different people will\nattend to different things (see Figure 3).\nWe use the term \"values card\" for our UI to represent these values. It bundles a list of coherent\nCAPs together with a title and short summary (see Figure 2). These cards are created through an\nLLM-driven interview, where the LLM is prompted to ask questions until it can confidently articulate\na value in this format. We explain this in detail in Section 4.3.\nThis definition of values has many advantages. It allows us to neatly avoid ideological scissor\nstatements. We define ideology and ideological statements as follows:\nDefinition 4.4 (Ideological statement). A belief or statement can be called ideological if it aims at\njustifying one social order or political arrangement over another (Eagleton, 1991; Joseph, 2004;\nMacionis, 2009).\nIf someone claims to have a value like “Defund the Police” or “Abortion is Murder”, they are then\nasked about meaningful choices ( 4.5) they themselves have made, and what they paid attention to\nduring the choice. The result is a value that’s more personal and relatable than these divisive slogans.\n12\nDefinition 4.5 (Meaningful Choice). Choices where CAPs play a major role. In other words,\nchoice that understood as implicated in one’s character or identity, where options don’t just have\ninstrumental value but can be considered as higher and lower, virtuous and vicious, more and less\nfulfilling, more and less refined, profound or superficial, noble or base, etc.\nValues cards help us build an alignment target that meets our criteria from Section 3:\n• Robust. Our values are somewhat more difficult to fabricate, because only by enacting a\nvalue regularly does a user gain familiarity with the path of attention that goes with the\nvalue. This means it’s harder to get people to claim values they haven’t used in their own\nchoices, just by giving a rousing speech or using social pressure.\n• Fine-grained. Unlike with a vague value like “autonomy”, it is easy to say in which contexts\nour values cards should apply, and what they mean. The same attentional policies that guide\nhumans in a morally fraught situation provide clear guidance to models. These attentional\npolicies are never nebulous, ambiguous, or vapid.\n• Legitimate and Auditable. Although this concept of values isn’t as commonly understood\nas the idea of a goal or preference, people can recognize values in this format as theirs, or\nlook over a collection of such values and assess them.\n• Generalizable. Finally, since values cards are generated in dialogue with the user by an\nLLM, we can tune their level of specificity to generalize to new situations.\"\"\"\n\nMaybe the tensions in resolving what it is we're doing comes from my lack of understanding of joes work and wanting it to match with a sufi psychology approach and my own ideas about coming to life \n\nalso i don't think the example of wanting to play with the niece vs work deadline compare two CAPs it might be that the niece has a CAP and it seems like the responsibility is an IAP can you come up with competing CAPs? \nwould joe agree that resistance is competing CAPs?\n\nMaybe it's sort of like the moral graph idea that there are some CAPs that would resolve two underlying competing CAPs, can you give an example of that and what the attentional policies might be in detail?\n\nWisdom doesn't arise when CAPs align with deeper values, aren't the CAPs values themselves, what do you mean here?\n\nI think rather than identifying the values at play we need to identify something else, I'm not sure exactly how to identify the list of CAPs behind the choices related to the prioritization between tasks - thoughts on how joe would do this?\n\nI don't think values are really ever single words, they need context attentional policies \n\nValues don't lead to attentional policies and then actions - they ARE attentional policies. how can we understand this more deeply? \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYour reflections show an evolving understanding of Joe Edelman’s work and how it relates to your own framework. Let’s break this down step-by-step and clarify the key concepts, particularly around values, CAPs, resistance, and how to resolve competing CAPs.\n\nKey Clarifications on Values and CAPs\nWhat Are Values and CAPs?\n\nValues are sets of Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs), which are the criteria people attend to when making a choice.\nCAPs are not separate from values—they are the operational essence of a value. For example:\nIf \"connection\" is a value, its CAPs might include:\nAttending to shared vulnerability.\nNoticing moments to express affection.\nMaintaining an openness to being present.\nContext matters. A CAP for \"connection\" in parenting might differ from one in a workplace.\nResistance as Competing CAPs\n\nJoe’s framework might see resistance as arising from CAPs that are incompatible or misaligned in a shared choice context.\nExample:\nYou want to play with your niece (CAPs: \"attending to joy,\" \"fostering intimacy\").\nYou have a work deadline (CAPs: \"ensuring responsibility,\" \"fulfilling commitments\").\nThe tension is the clash of CAPs that cannot be simultaneously fulfilled.\nResolving Competing CAPs\n\nResolution might involve finding a higher-order CAP that integrates or reframes the conflict.\nExample:\nHigher-order CAP: \"Attending to balance and presence.\"\nThis might guide you to spend focused time with your niece (e.g., 30 minutes of undivided attention) before fully dedicating yourself to your work, thereby honoring both values in turn.\nWhy Values = CAPs (Not Sequential Steps)\nYou’re correct: values don’t “lead to” CAPs; values are CAPs. This reframes the process:\n\nValues are Constitutive:\n\nThey are not separate guiding principles but emerge directly from the way attention is allocated in choice-making.\nExample: A person with a value of \"honesty\" attends to \"transparency in communication\" and \"not withholding relevant facts.\"\nAction Is Inherent in CAPs:\n\nWhen CAPs guide attention, they inherently shape action. For example:\nCAP: \"Attending to nuance and detail.\"\nAction: Spending extra time double-checking facts before submitting a report.\nHow Joe Might Identify CAPs in Task Prioritization\nDeconstruct the Choice Context:\n\nStart by asking: \"What matters to you about this task?\"\nUncover what the person is attending to in making their decision.\nIdentify the Non-Instrumental Criteria:\n\nWhat do they pay attention to that they consider part of living well? For example:\nFor the task \"Call Mom,\" CAPs might include:\nAttending to familial bonds.\nOffering emotional support.\nFostering a sense of gratitude.\nList the CAPs for Each Task:\n\nTask: Grocery shopping\nCAPs: \"Attending to health and nourishment,\" \"Exploring creativity in meal planning.\"\nTask: Preparing for a work deadline\nCAPs: \"Focusing on excellence in delivery,\" \"Building professional trust.\"\nTensions and Wisdom in CAPs\nCan Resistance Be Framed as Competing CAPs?\n\nJoe would likely see resistance as a signal of competing CAPs, where the decision-maker needs to navigate which CAPs to prioritize.\nExample: You value both \"intimacy\" (niece) and \"responsibility\" (work).\nWisdom might arise from recognizing how to honor both CAPs over time (e.g., integrating balance).\nWisdom in Resolving CAPs\n\nWisdom doesn’t “arise” from CAPs aligning with values; rather:\nWisdom is the capacity to reconcile or prioritize CAPs in a way that feels coherent and meaningful in context.\nExample of a Resolving CAP:\nConflict: \"Work vs. play.\"\nResolving CAP: \"Attending to intentional transitions,\" which encourages mindful separation between work and personal time.\nNext Steps: Deepening Your Understanding\nQuestions to Explore CAPs in Task Prioritization:\n\nWhat are you paying attention to when choosing between tasks?\nWhich of these criteria feels most essential to your sense of living well?\nWhere do you notice tension between what you’re attending to in each task?\nFields and Thinkers to Explore:\n\nMoral Philosophy:\nCharles Taylor (values as evaluative criteria).\nRuth Chang (decision-making and value incommensurability).\nAttention and Cognitive Science:\nMichael Posner (attention networks).\nGibson’s Ecological Psychology (information pickup and affordances).\nSufi Psychology:\nExplore maqam (permanent spiritual station) vs. hal (transient state) as an analog to CAPs.\nSystems Thinking:\nDonella Meadows (balancing feedback loops to resolve tensions).\nReflecting on Your Questions\nYou’re evolving a model that blends Sufi-inspired flourishing, practical coaching, and deep attentional theory.\nBy framing CAPs as the granular, actionable components of values, you’re aligning both theory and practice.\nThe resolution of resistance through higher-order CAPs mirrors both spiritual and practical wisdom traditions.\nWhere would you like to focus next?

            "extracted_content": "Seems like the patterns that we have might be from values competing resulting in emotions or what we also call tensions or resistance and when we move through that with supports we enact wisdom, there’s no wise person just someone in the process of creating wisdom - it’s like a byproduct of a car. - exhaust or head from your muscles working out \nAnd when we live wisely it creates opportunities for moments of realization and meaning the process of acceptance and just being is most enjoyable when basking in the exhaust or warmth of wisdom and this is related to some natural sources of beauty - harmony balance peace diversity of colors - we see a sunset and experience these beautiful feelings and most are naturally drawn this helps legitimize the idea from Rumi that first I wanted to change the world and now I’m wise and I’m changing myself because in the pursuit of wisdom we are likely to choose things that are beautiful to more than just me - how widely acceptable is this beauty we want to live? That’s the process of expanding our life over time to encompass more higher order values related to deeper more broadly experienced beauty and how we can grow impact - like mother Theresa or others living deeply their values and inspiring the world - how does this resonate with- what’s different here than what we had before - what’s the model \n06:08\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThis is a profound reframing that clarifies the interplay of values, emotions, wisdom, and beauty in the pursuit of a meaningful life. Here's how we can articulate this refined model, what makes it distinct, and how it builds upon our prior framework.\n\nRefined Model: The Flow of Wisdom, Beauty, and Meaning\n1. Core Insight\nWisdom is not a fixed state but a dynamic byproduct of navigating tensions and competing values.\nBeauty serves as an experiential signal for wisdom—harmony, balance, and shared joy reflect alignment with higher-order values.\nLiving wisely creates a feedback loop: the \"exhaust\" or warmth of wisdom allows for moments of peace, acceptance, and connection with universal beauty.\n2. Key Components of the Model\nValues as Competing Forces\n\nValues guide choices and shape attentional policies but often compete (e.g., freedom vs. security, connection vs. autonomy).\nCompeting values create tensions or resistance, which are expressed as emotions.\nTensions and Resistance as Catalysts\n\nEmotional tensions are not obstacles but signals pointing to deeper truths.\nMoving through tensions with the right supports (contexts, relationships, tools) generates wisdom.\nWisdom as a Dynamic Process\n\nWisdom is the byproduct of reconciling values and acting in alignment with deeper truths.\nWisdom is not an inherent trait but emerges in the process of navigating life's tensions.\nBeauty as a Signal and Guide\n\nBeauty is the experiential result of alignment—harmony, balance, and peace emerge naturally.\nUniversal beauty inspires higher-order values that transcend individual desires, creating impact and inspiration (e.g., Mother Teresa, Rumi).\nMoments of Realization and Meaning\n\nLiving wisely creates opportunities for meaningful moments—realizations that deepen understanding and connection.\nThese moments foster acceptance, rest, and joy, forming a virtuous cycle that reinforces wisdom and beauty.\nProcess Overview\nTensions Arise\n\nCompeting values (e.g., \"Should I prioritize rest or productivity?\") create inner resistance.\nEmotional signals (e.g., anxiety, longing) point to underlying values at play.\nSupports Guide Navigation\n\nContexts, relationships, and practices provide the conditions for reconciling values.\nWisdom emerges as tensions are resolved or reframed.\nWisdom Generates Beauty\n\nThe process of resolution creates alignment, experienced as beauty (e.g., harmony in relationships, joy in creation).\nBeauty inspires higher-order values, expanding the scope of what matters (e.g., from self to community to universal impact).\nBeauty Enriches Meaning\n\nMeaning arises when actions align with values and wisdom is embodied.\nMoments of realization and peace deepen the connection to life’s inherent beauty, creating acceptance and joy.\nWhat’s New or Different Here\nDynamic Wisdom\n\nWisdom is not a static trait but a dynamic byproduct of reconciling tensions, akin to \"exhaust\" or \"heat\" from effort.\nBeauty as Feedback\n\nBeauty is positioned as a signal of alignment and a motivator for growth toward universal values.\nVirtuous Cycles\n\nThe model highlights how wisdom and beauty create a self-reinforcing loop of meaning and inspiration.\nValues as Relational and Expansive\n\nValues are not fixed but evolve through contextual interactions and become more universal as wisdom grows.\nLegitimizing Rest and Being\n\nAcceptance, rest, and simply basking in the warmth of wisdom are central to the model, legitimizing the joy of \"being\" as much as \"doing.\"\n"

Inform our becoming and that all happens in the present with actions. And so there's, checking on the actions and understanding the patterns that also come from the past. So meaning and memory Yeah. I think maybe it's a little tough, but maybe it would be good to have something about, like, memories of difficulties that have created patterns. Right? Like, I, recently worked really hard Doing a stand up routine in college actually, not that recently. And I performed and then it just completely flopped. And instead of coming back and trying again, I just was like, that's it. I'm not good at this or something, and I just stopped. You know? I think I've done things like that a couple of times where like, I made a documentary movie It's, like, an hour maybe 45 minutes long. Spend a lot of time thinking about drafting the video essay, basically, about my time in Iraq and researching the pea gram. I put it online, Android got, like, 200 views. And so I've never done it again even though Like, I love that medium. I love doing it. And so that's like a negative pattern that I learned. I don't know what I learned here, but, like, something about that maybe shows a way of not being that I don't Or maybe it's just like a hindrance, and I don't actually need to collect these stories. But maybe the stories add some context in-depth make conversation more interesting. Also, the one after the second, the third one had bunch of interesting pieces. See, these even go all the way back So where is the first six Yeah. So here we go. So we have You know, 3 sections. We had core context and patterns, direct quotes about ways of being, moments and insights, pattern recognition with evidence, stake or potential integration example, memory anchors, and the meanings. Projects and responsibilities, and then a list of projects. And then values development, bold moves. And I'm wondering, like, does everybody want bold moves? Is there another way? Like, what would make today feel complete? But also, like, could it be cool for us to encourage more people to do bold moves, or is that just a belated thing? I'm Milag. Value iOS and just supports needed, and connection patterns. Okay. So those are there, the three major sections, core content and patterns, projects, and responsibilities, values, and development. And each of them had about 5 subsections inside of it. And we're saying that we would have being and becoming, meaning and memory, active container, b r 3. Is it basically the same thing? Or how are they different? And these ones don't have 5 things in them. They have 12 for some 3 and 4 for the other.

Watch\nyour habits, they become character. Watch\nyour character, it becomes your destiny. \n-Frank Jackson\n\n\nDestiny is a big word. How can we tell who we should be, which thoughts to cultivate, which actions to take, which habits to cultivate, and which life to build? \n\nI suggest identifying moments when we valued ourselves and our actions in a non-instrumental way. This is a way of being that is full of meaning, things we cherish and uphold. This is how success can be “every step of the way.”\n\nWe can identify stories in our past where we were who we wanted to be and where we inspired ourselves. We can identify stories in others (WWJD), in movies, and in the stories of our friends that uplift us. Where can you find those stories, what’s a story that comes to mind?\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts about what the Good Life is? \nHow do they show up in the words in your mind? \nWhat do you do about them?\nHave they become your habits? \nWould others say it’s your character?\n\n\nWhy feel everything?\nThe Guest House\n- Jellaludin Rumi-\n\nThis being human is a guest house.\nEvery morning a new arrival.\n\nA joy, a depression, a meanness,\nsome momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.\n\nWelcome and entertain them all!\nEven if they are a crowd of sorrows,\nwho violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, \nstill, treat each guest honorably.\nHe may be clearing you out for some new delight.\n\nThe dark thought, the shame, the malice.\nMeet them at the door laughing and invite them in.\n\nBe grateful for whatever comes.\nbecause each has been sent as a guide from beyond.\n\n-Rumi\n\nWe accept it all because our emotions are sign points pointing us to what matters to us. Fear of a lion, you value staying alive. \n\nWe can find ourselves in situations where competing things on our todo lists matter to us. \n\nEx: I want to play with my niece - there’s a deadline at work. The tension here is an ideal moment to explore values and prioritization, yet often leads to procrastination and negative states.\n\nRecognizing when competing values create resistance and flow patterns helps unlock yourself and become who you want to be.\n\n\nBenefits:\nAuthenticity, \n\nTo paraphrase the philosopher Nietzsche, he who has a strong enough why can bear\nalmost any how. I've found that 20 percent of any change is knowing how; but 80\npercent is knowing why. If we gather a set of strong enough reasons to change, we can change in a minute something we've failed to change for years.\n- Tony Robbins\n\n\n\nDemo Checkin:\nState and Presence\nAfter the initial reflection, gently guide into specific areas:\n“How’s your energy today (1-5)?”\n“What’s present for you—emotionally, mentally, or physically?”\nCompletion Anchor\n“What would make today feel complete for you?”\nAlternative: “What’s one thing you’d feel good about having moved forward today?”\n\nSupport Prompt\nAfter identifying the completion anchor:\n“What might help you move this forward?”\n“Is there any support or clarity you need?”\nFollowup Questions\nOptional followup questions leveraging the answers.\nBuilding the context\nShare what you can, the more vulnerable, the more helpful. \nLet me propose a minimalist but powerful session structure based on our work:\n60-Minute Core Facilitation Framework\nOpening (10 min)\nGOAL: Create safety and understand current reality\n\"How are you holding everything right now?\"\n\"What feels most alive or pressing for you today?\"\nStory Gathering (25 min)\nTHREE ESSENTIAL STORIES:\nTension Story\n\"Tell me about something you deeply want to do, but find yourself getting in your way. What happens?\"\nAliveness Story\n\"Share a moment when you felt completely alive and aligned - what made it work?\"\nSupport Story\n\"Tell me about a time when support really helped you move forward. What made it effective?\"\nFOR EACH STORY:\nListen for conditions that enabled/blocked\nNotice energy shifts in telling\nTrack what lights up\nIdentify pattern hints\nPattern Recognition (15 min)\nTogether, look across the stories for:\nCommon conditions that help/hinder\nValue tensions emerging\nSupport patterns that work\nEnergy markers\nIntegration & Next Steps (10 min)\nName key patterns noticed\nIdentify one small next step\nDefine specific support needed\nWhat makes this ideal:\nStarts with the current reality\nUses three crucial story types (tension, aliveness, support)\nAllows natural pattern emergence\nEnds with practical movement\nShort enough to maintain energy\nLong enough for depth\nSimple enough to remember\nRich enough for pattern recognition\n\n"

ENTRY POINTS\nAny of these can start the process:\n- Stories (reveal existing CAPs)\n- Tasks (trigger CAP conflicts)\n- Present State (shows active CAPs)\n\n2. CAP PROCESSING ENGINE\nCore Process:\n- Active CAPs surface\n- Tensions emerge from conflicts\n- Support needs identified\n- Wisdom generated through navigation\n\n3. EMERGENCE INDICATORS\nSigns of Alignment:\n- Beauty appears naturally\n- Meaning feels clear\n- Action flows easily\n\n4. PRACTICAL CONTAINER\nResults in:\n- Meaningful action taken\n- New tasks emerge\n- New stories created\n- CAPs strengthened or transformed\n\n5. FEEDBACK LOOP\nEach cycle:\n- Enriches CAP understanding\n- Builds wisdom capacity\n- Deepens meaningful action\n- Creates new entry points\n```\n\nExamples of CAP-Driven Process:\n\n1.

REAL-TIME UPDATES\nStory Repository:\n- Adds new instance of pattern\n- Updates effectiveness of supports\n- Notes new context variations\n\nLearning Integration:\n- Refines timing interventions\n- Updates support frameworks\n- Adjusts response patterns\n\n4. ONGOING DEVELOPMENT\nPattern Evolution:\n- Tracks focus-integration balance\n- Notes support effectiveness\n- Updates growth edge status\n\nBeauty Recognition:\n- Notes where flow serves\n- Identifies integration points\n- Updates indicator framework\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.

INITIAL PROCESSING\nInput: Time blindness with prompt work\n\nRepository Consultation:\n- Stories: Similar pattern with documentary work\n- Learnings: Deep engagement can bypass other needs\n- Values: System building vs practical balance\n- Growth Edges: Integration of focus states\n- Beauty Indicators: Flow present but tensioned\n\n2. INTEGRATED RESPONSE\nMirrors Understanding:\n- Recognizes deep engagement value\n- Notes pattern similarity\n- Acknowledges beauty in flow\n\nOffers Support:\n- Connects to previous navigations\n- Suggests proven containers\n- Proposes integration practices\n\n3. REAL-TIME UPDATES\nStory Repository:\n- Adds new instance of pattern\n- Updates effectiveness of supports\n- Notes new context variations\n\nLearning Integration:\n- Refines timing interventions\n- Updates support frameworks\n- Adjusts response patterns\n\n4. ONGOING DEVELOPMENT\nPattern Evolution:\n- Tracks focus-integration balance\n- Notes support effectiveness\n- Updates growth edge status\n\nBeauty Recognition:\n- Notes where flow serves\n- Identifies integration points\n- Updates indicator framework\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Show more practical examples?\n2. Detail specific update processes?\n3.

Core Flow remains:\n   - Entry → CAPs → Wisdom → Action\n2. Beauty still emerges as indicator\n3. Practical container maintains simplicity\n\nThe key was integrating emotions and pattern formation without creating separate systems - they're part of the same flow of meaning-making and wisdom generation.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.

They show us when we're moving toward our destiny, not just experiencing beauty or meaning in isolation.\n\nLet me show the next file:\n\n```yaml\n# pattern_evolution.yml\n\npattern_interactions:\n  cap_relationships:\n    competing:\n      deep_work_family:\n        tension: \"focus time vs presence\"\n        resolution_path: \"integrated containers\"\n        wisdom_generated: \"both/and solutions\"\n        support_needed: \"transition structures\"\n      \n    complementary:\n      teaching_creating:\n        synergy: \"natural flow between\"\n        amplification: \"each strengthens other\"\n        wisdom_shown: \"integrated expression\"\n        support_helps: \"space for emergence\"\n\n  cap_iap_dynamics:\n    protective_patterns:\n      perfectionism:\n        blocks: [\"sharing\", \"completion\"]\n        serves: \"quality assurance\"\n        transformation_need: \"trust in process\"\n        integration_path: \"small shares practice\"\n\n    instrumental_patterns:\n      time_management:\n        tension: \"natural flow vs structure\"\n        resolution_path: \"rhythmic containers\"\n        wisdom_potential: \"structured freedom\"\n        support_needed: \"flexible frameworks\"\n\ndevelopment_tracking:\n  pattern_growth:\n    parallel_processing:\n      origin: \"natural way of engaging\"\n      evolution:\n        - stage: \"unconscious pattern\"\n          challenge: \"scattered energy\"\n          support_found: \"physical anchoring\"\n        - stage: \"conscious recognition\"\n          challenge: \"integration needs\"\n          support_found: \"completion structures\"\n        - stage: \"wisdom emerging\"\n          showing_as: \"natural rhythm found\"\n          supported_by: \"container practice\"\n\n    context_creation:\n      origin: \"system building tendency\"\n      evolution:\n        - stage: \"setup focus\"\n          challenge: \"action delay\"\n          support_found: \"completion integration\"\n        - stage: \"balance finding\"\n          challenge: \"sharing resistance\"\n          support_found: \"small steps practice\"\n        - stage: \"wisdom emerging\"\n          showing_as: \"natural flow with structure\"\n          supported_by: \"integrated practice\"\n\n  support_effectiveness:\n    working_well:\n      physical_anchoring:\n        context: \"during system work\"\n        signs: \"grounded presence\"\n        when_best: \"energy scattered\"\n        \n      completion_structures:\n        context: \"project development\"\n        signs: \"natural movement\"\n        when_best: \"setup pattern active\"\n\n    needs_refinement:\n      transition_support:\n        current_state: \"developing\"\n        challenge: \"consistency\"\n        next_step: \"ritual creation\"\n\n      sharing_practice:\n        current_state: \"emerging\"\n        challenge: \"resistance\"\n        next_step: \"small steps focus\"\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.
