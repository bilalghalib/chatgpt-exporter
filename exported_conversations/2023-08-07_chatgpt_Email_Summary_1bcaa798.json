      "content": "To run the code from the terminal, you would typically create a Python script, then execute that script using the Python interpreter. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Create a Python Script**:\n    - Copy the Python code into a new file.\n    - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example: `extract_info.py`.\n\n2. **Prepare the Data**:\n    - Ensure that the CSV file (`'Assessment results sync production - Application Form HMN2-2.csv'` in this case) is in the same directory as the Python script, or adjust the path in the script accordingly.\n\n3. **Install Required Libraries**:\n    - You need to have `pandas` installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using `pip`:\n      ```bash\n      pip install pandas\n      ```\n\n4. **Run the Script**:\n    - Open the terminal (or command prompt on Windows).\n    - Navigate to the directory where your script is located.\n    - Run the script using the Python interpreter:\n      ```bash\n      python extract_info.py\n      ```\n\n5. **Check the Output**:\n    - After execution, you should see an `extracted_info.csv` file in the same directory, containing the extracted information for the provided emails.\n\n**Note**: If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed on your machine, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python` to run the script.",
