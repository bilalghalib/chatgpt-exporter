As an enterprise we believe that women have indigenous knowledge, and understand the challenges facing them. Through community conversations and dialogues, Tombo Agri-Con Agencies created a platform giving a center stage to all the women to share the challenges through which they identify the solutions to these challenges and prioritize which challenge has to be address first and through which solutions. This is because since memorial women are the corner stone of a family/home yet they are the most affected with issues of climate change, floods, drought, gender based violence, fire out breaks, denied rights to education and even rights to own a property.
