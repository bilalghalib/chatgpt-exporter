Didn’t dig deep enough. Review this.\n\nVery interesting review of entrepreneurship assessments out there and the styles of questions they use, found in this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311364219_PROMOTING_THE_ENTREPRENEURSHIP_COMPETENCE_OF_YOUNG_ADULTS_IN_EUROPE_TOWARDS_A_SELF-ASSESSMENT_TOOL\n\n\n4 types of validity:\nhttps://codesignal.com/blog/tech-recruiting/assessment-validation-and-why-its-a-game-changer-for-your-tech-hiring/\n1.

Some people need help validating skills they learned outside formal training. \nAlso, the development of “evidence” and portfolios takes time. It might be a good thing to do though. Perhaps rather than an “assessment” we work with them to create a portfolio of evidence and the “assessment form” compiles the content and produces the PDF, sort of like at the bridge for billions tool\n Validation of non-formal and informal learning | CEDEFOP\n\nWas presented at: \nLet’s go next year, haha!\n\n\nSkillable is bullish on AI:\nhttps://www.skillable.com/resources/skill-validation-development/the-impact-of-ai-on-skills-validation/\n\nEuropass skills transfer is interesting to watch: https://europa.eu/europass/en\n\n\nLarge skills assessment library/company raised 15 mil to continue building it out: https://www.imocha.io/tests/leadership-assessment-test\nhttps://www.imocha.io/pre-employment-testing/business-skills\n\n\nSkills need to be verified before visa applications, let’s see how they do that:\nhttps://visaenvoy.com/skills-priority-list/\nInteresting to see what skills are needed, i wonder if we can gather that from many countries\n\nAlso, Australia seems to have a department in their gov working on skills:\nhttps://www.asqa.gov.au/resources/videos-and-webinars/webinar-spotlight-assessment-validation\n\nThey work with you to accredit courses..\nThey also help training orgs in many ways. I like these guys… https://www.asqa.gov.au/online-learning/planning\n\nOk australia has businesses that help training organizations do the 5 year assessment validation process (Haaaa, if only we started 5 years ago) https://www.skillseducation.com.au/pages/tools-and-templates\n\nCompare to europass\n\n\n<- None of this is free :( https://www.skillseducation.com.au/pages/tools-and-templates#\n\nAustralia has a course to help people create valid assessments: https://asctraining.com.au/courses/assessor-skill-set/\nIt’s 7 days and i think applicable to lots of people!\n\n\n\n\nFound some while searching online: https://www.its.vic.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Assessment-Judgement-Validation-Report-2015.1.docx is a document they use to assess assessments as valid/etc\n\nOne way not to deal with self reporting is to get more of the assessments submitted as video: \nhttps://eskill.com/\n\n\n\n\n\nOne framing is called Outcome-Based Assessments (OBAs) -> Goes into certifications? And which would be easiest/most helpful/already built into our processes that we can use? specifically designed for evaluating entrepreneurial skills. Outcome-Based Assessment focuses on the end results of the learning process, evaluating what learners can actually do with the knowledge and skills they have acquired. This approach is particularly relevant for entrepreneurial skills, as it emphasizes practical application and real-world impact. Here are some key types of OBAs used for assessing entrepreneurial skills:\nBusiness Plan Development and Presentation:\nLearners create a comprehensive business plan and present it. This assesses their ability to conceive, plan, and articulate a business idea, covering market analysis, financial planning, and strategy.\nSimulations and Role-Playing Exercises:\nParticipants engage in simulations that mimic real-life entrepreneurial challenges. This can include handling a startup scenario, responding to market changes, or pitching to investors.\nProject-Based Learning (PBL):\nLearners undertake a project where they must apply entrepreneurial skills to develop a product or service, manage a team, or execute a small business venture.\nPortfolio Assessments:\nLearners compile a portfolio of work that demonstrates their entrepreneurial skills. This can include business plans, marketing strategies, financial analyses, and reflective essays on their learning journey.\nCase Study Analysis:\nAssessment based on the analysis of real-world business cases, where learners must apply their entrepreneurial knowledge to solve problems, make decisions, or recommend strategies.\nSelf and Peer Assessments:\nLearners and their peers assess each other’s entrepreneurial skills based on group projects or collaborative tasks. This can include feedback on leadership, teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving abilities.\nCompetitions and Challenges:\nOrganizing or participating in entrepreneurial competitions or challenges where learners pitch ideas, develop prototypes, or present business solutions to real-world problems.\nReflection and Self-Evaluation:\nEncouraging learners to reflect on their own entrepreneurial journey, challenges faced, and learning outcomes. This can be done through journals, blogs, or reflective essays.\n360-Degree Feedback:\nGathering feedback from multiple sources, including instructors, peers, industry mentors, or even potential customers, to evaluate learners’ entrepreneurial skills.\n\nFor the future along with AI check into videos and gaming:\nPeople are starting to use games, we can test many of these out here: \nhttps://www.graduatesfirst.com/product/game-based-assessment-practice\n\n\n8 unique, exclusive game assessments:\nBalloon game (BART): risk taking assessment typical for banking and finance jobs\nCognition-A™: attention assessment used for consultancy and pharma jobs\nCognition-M™: cognitive memory assessment for consultancy, FMCG and tech jobs\ni-EQ™: emotional intelligence game for consultancy, banking and finance jobs\nMTA-Tray™: organisational game assessment for IT, consultancy, banking & accounting jobs\nMathBubbles™: arithmetic assessment typical for Consulting, FMCG, Big Tech, and Banking jobs\nFlanker Task: attention-based assessment for consulting, banking, and technology\nPassCode™: attention & resilience assessment used for technology, banking, finance, and more\n\nImportant for PM verification is developing SOPs/Checklists for things to look for (to then be used to train AI), save the data\n\n\nAnother way we can assess things is by doing multiple things and people needing to take the self assessment, review it with someone else, and get the feedback into our credentialing system for them to be able to have “proof” - maybe it can be on the community platform, or somewhere public. A test as well as other things, and all that can go together to create a badge sort of like this: \n\nhttps://learn.ibm.com/files/analytics/DAELL/DAELL-Badge-Program/data_science/index.html\n\nhttps://skillsbuild.org/adult-learners/digital-credentials\n\nI think this is why we should have a badge. We can even have different “gradients” of badges\nRather than simply having a pre/post - what we can say is that we have disbursed X badges \nThis resolves some issues\nIf the badge for “Entrepreneur in progress” (or a better name) is someone who took the assessment, and then learned a bunch of things and took it again and needed to reassess their levels on the assessment, and then discussed it with a coach who then sent us a report which unlocks their credential… that can be cool. For our funders we can have a credentials overview page which can be a sort of outcomes page - rather than the dashboard we were doing before all numerical yet not so meaningful because the numbers were self reported. \nThis badge system can both have a number of badges out in the wild, as well as have each badge say how they got there. \nAnd also, they’d contain their own pudding as proof inside themselves because they’re delicious. It’s late, sorry Dara. haha\n\nThey have a cool skills related accelerator for sustainability: \nhttps://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator\n\nThought I’d check into what the French are doing, maybe Dara can figure it out better than google translate and Bilal, haha:\nhttps://travail--emploi-gouv-fr.translate.goog/formation-professionnelle/certification-competences-pro/?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc\n\n\nInteresting to see this approach to download a domain expert’s knowledge and make  test out of it:\nhttps://www.testgorilla.com/test-library/situational-judgment-tests/leadership-people-management-test/\n\n\n\nFound that there are domain specific skill verification organizations, for example:\n\nAviation industry:\nhttps://store.icao.int/en/validating-competency-based-training\nNurses are working on it: \nStandardizing Assessment of Competences and Competencies of Oncology Nurses Working in Ambulatory Care\nEnergy sector:\nhttps://mtcsuk.com/\n\nMaritime Skills: https://www.dnv.com/maritime/competence-certification.html#\n\n(Interesting to note the qualifications that make the competence certification useful)\nAnd how they define competence:https://mtcsuk.com/certification/\nWhat is Competence?\nCompetence can be defined as having subject Knowledge, the Skills to perform a task and Experience in a role.\n\nIt takes all three to earn MTCS Competence Certification, because it takes all three to be both efficient and safe in the workplace in the maritime industry.\nKnowledge\nIt’s not enough to just know how to repeat a task. To work safely, you must understand what that task does and why it’s needed. That knowledge allows you to handle things going wrong and to make decisions under unusual circumstances.\nSkills\nTo perform your duties effectively, you need to reach at least a certain minimum level of skill. Skill refers to the ability to perform a task safely, efficiently, and in accordance with company/industry guidelines and procedures.\nExperience\nIn many ways, experience measures the length of time you have successfully worked in a particular role. During this time you will have demonstrated the ability to combine skills and knowledge and to evaluate the situation when things change. Experience is often regarded as the most important factor when considering Competence.\n\n\n\nMulti party collaboration alignment on skills / skills database:\nhttps://www.transvalproject.eu/downloads/\n\nPDF I found which I thought had an interesting six component framework for the competencies our future civilization requires. It’s from the OECD - so of course it has a “everyone’s gotta work” bias. Yet still. I found it interesting ;D https://www.deseco.ch/bfs/deseco/en/index/02.parsys.43469.downloadList.2296.DownloadFile.tmp/2005.dskcexecutivesummary.en.pdf\n\nEntrecomp assessment was verified here: \nEntreComp Questionnaire: A Self-Assessment Tool for Entrepreneurship Competencies https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359006922_EntreComp_Questionnaire_A_Self-Assessment_Tool_for_Entrepreneurship_Competencies\n\nAssessments validated by “managers” in this app:\n\nOutcome from this PDF: \nhttps://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=26999&langId=en \nThere is no agreement in the EU, there are some credentials. Their recommendations:\nThe challenges identified are by no mean insurmountable. However, they need increased\nefforts by PES, to build comprehensive and effective skills-based services. It is\nrecommended that PES:\n- Strengthen the skills-centred cooperation of stakeholders. Skills-based\nservices (including skills assessment, validation and recognition, and skills-based\ntraining) require participation of numerous bodies, stakeholders and actors, who\nshould cooperate closely. In particular, cooperation regarding the validation and\nrecognition of skills between PES and the education sector, including training and\nvalidation providers, is crucial for the effectiveness of skills-related activities. PES\nshould play an active (possibly coordinating) role to stimulate skills validation\namong multiple actors involved in this process.\n- Support green and digital transitions through skills development. Skills\nassessment and recognition procedures should lead to the development of\naccessible reskilling and upskilling pathways towards the twin transition, with the\naim of securing future employment for interested individuals. PES should continue\nto play an active role in supporting just transitions, greening of European economies\nand the development of much-needed digital skills.\n\n- Ensure establishment of transparent procedures for data protection and\nsharing of personal data. Personal data on skills is sensitive; as a rule, access to\nthem is provided to the individual and PES staff. However, it needs to be shared in\na safe and trustworthy way among all relevant stakeholders, especially PES and\neducation and training bodies, potential employers or institutions involved in the\nrecognition and validation of skills. As such, procedures for data protection and\nsharing are the backbone of the skills-based support system.\n- Increase accessibility and availability of skills-based activities and\nsupport. Notably, although some elements of skills-based processes (e.g., skills\nassessment) are well-established in PES, more efforts need to be made to increase\naccessibility for interested individuals. This requires not only streamlining the skills-\nbased perspective into PES services (which often means changing from an\noccupational to a skills perspective), but also dissemination actions among potential\nusers. As jobseekers and employment counsellors can be hesitant to use a skills-\nbased approach, there is a need to build trust and knowledge of these processes.\n- Develop skills-based taxonomies and services. An important challenge for\nskills assessment, validation and recognition stems from the inadequate\ndevelopment of a relevant taxonomy that is skills-based rather than occupational.\nCommon language – especially in terms of skills taxonomy – is crucial to the skills-\nrelated processes of matching and other PES services. The transition from an\noccupation-based to a skills-based approach also requires initiatives to change the\nexisting PES culture and ensure and support the application by PES staff.\n- Explore further the potential of micro-credentials as a form of skills-based\ntraining. Micro-credentials are a relatively new tool for most PES, but they show\nsignificant potential as a form of training intervention. In order to function\neffectively, they need to be embedded in other elements of the skills-focused\nsystem, including skills-based matching and profiling in PES, as well as qualification\nsystems like National Qualification Frameworks. As micro-credentials are only\nstarting to gain recognition among stakeholders, awareness raising should be an\nimportant activity of PES and other actors.\n\nhttps://www.1edtech.org/certification/procure-certified\nThere is a business who is attempting to do what the EU recommendation says. They are developing standards and coordinating across organizations to align them. Let’s see what skills they are validating and how.  \n\nUN PDF on their own internal leadership measure/vision: https://unsceb.org/sites/default/files/imported_files/Leadership_0.pdf\n",
