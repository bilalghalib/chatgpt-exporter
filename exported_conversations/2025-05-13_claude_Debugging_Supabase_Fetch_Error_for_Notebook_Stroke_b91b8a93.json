Write naturally, and watch as your notebook comes alive with AI-powered insights and connections.\n\n## Core Features\n\n- **Natural Handwriting Recognition**: Write naturally on a digital canvas with automatic AI transcription\n- **Unified Chat-Card System**: Seamlessly interact with your content through either chat or cards on the canvas\n- **Relationship-Centric Model**: Focuses on connections between ideas as first-class entities\n- **Spatial-Temporal Organization**: Arrange ideas spatially while preserving context and history\n- **AI-Powered Insights**: Get intelligent responses to your handwritten notes\n- **Collaborative Thinking**: Work together in real-time with multiple perspectives\n\n## NEW: Unified Relationship-Centric Model\n\nThe new version of Cursive features a powerful relationship-centric model that puts connections between ideas at the forefront:\n\n### Core Model Structure\n\nThe fundamental unit is the relationship triple:\n\n```\n{\n  \"from_node\": {\n    \"content\": \"text or reference to artifact\",\n    \"type\": \"question|response|note|drawing\"\n  },\n  \"connection\": {\n    \"type\": \"supports|contradicts|questions|extends|tensions\",\n    \"vector\": {\n      \"direction\": \"resolving|exploring|deepening\",\n      \"intention\": \"why this connection exists\",\n      \"state\": \"active|resolved|abandoned\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"to_node\": {\n    \"content\": \"text or reference to artifact\",\n    \"type\": \"question|response|note|drawing\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis structure enables:\n- **Text-First Operation**: Everything can be created, viewed, and manipulated as text\n- **Relationship as Entity**: Connections have their own properties and context\n- **Spatial Canvas + Sequential Chat**: Interact through either spatial canvas or chat interface\n- **Fully Recursive**: Relationships can connect to other relationships\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nCursive is built on three main technologies:\n1. **Next.js**: Frontend framework and API routes\n2. **Supabase**: Database, authentication, and real-time functionality\n3. **Claude AI**: Handwriting recognition and conversational capabilities\n\n### Canvas System\n\nThe canvas is built using Konva.js and consists of several layers:\n- **DrawingLayer**: Handles pen strokes and eraser functionality\n- **ThreadsLayer**: Manages thread cards and their interactions\n- **ConnectionLayer**: Renders visual connections between related threads\n- **UnifiedCardThread**: Represents both chat messages and canvas cards\n\n### Relationship Model\n\nThe relationship model organizes content into a connected network:\n- **Nodes**: Questions, responses, notes, and drawings\n- **Relationships**: Connections between nodes with rich properties\n- **Vectors**: Directional properties of relationships showing intention and state\n\n## Environment Setup\n\nThe application requires the following environment variables:\n\n```\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key  # Required for database migrations\n```\n\n### Database Setup\n\nWhen setting up the application for the first time or after schema changes, you need to run database migrations:\n\n#### Option 1: Using Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)\n1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard\n2. Go to the SQL Editor section\n3. Create a new query\n4. Copy and paste the contents of the migration file:\n   - `supabase/migrations/unified_canvas_chat_system.sql`\n5. Run the query\n\n#### Option 2: Using Database Fix Scripts\n1. Ensure your SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY is set in .env.local\n2. Run: `node tools/fix_database.js`\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst, run the development server:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or\nyarn dev\n# or\npnpm dev\n# or\nbun dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.\n\n## Unified Experience\n\nThe new unified card-chat experience provides two ways to interact with your notebook:\n\n1. **Classic Canvas View**: Traditional canvas with drawing, text, and AI interaction\n2. **Unified Card-Chat View**: A relationship-centric view that unifies chat and cards\n\nTo switch between views:\n- Use the toggle in the toolbar\n- Navigate to `/notebooks/[id]/unified` URL path\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\ncursive-app/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── canvas/              # Canvas-specific components\n│   │   │   ├── UnifiedCardThread.tsx    # New card-chat component\n│   │   │   ├── UnifiedCanvasContainer.tsx # New unified container\n│   │   │   ├── DrawingLayer.tsx        # Handles pen/eraser functionality\n│   │   │   ├── ConnectionLayer.tsx     # Relationship visualization\n│   │   │   └── ...\n│   │   ├── conversation/        # Chat components\n│   │   │   ├── ChatPanel.tsx    # Chat interface\n│   │   │   ├── ChatInput.tsx    # Message input\n│   │   │   └── ChatMessage.tsx  # Individual message\n│   ├── hooks/                   # Custom hooks\n│   │   └── ...\n│   ├── services/                # API services\n│   │   └── nodeService.ts       # Service for nodes and relationships\n│   ├── stores/                  # Zustand stores\n│   │   └── nodeStore.ts         # State management for nodes and relationships\n│   ├── types/                   # TypeScript types\n│   │   └── thread.ts            # Relationship-centric type definitions\n│   └── utils/                   # Utility functions\n│       └── migrationUtils.ts    # Database migration helpers\n├── tools/                       # Utility scripts\n│   └── fix_database.js          # Database setup and migration script\n└── supabase/                    # Supabase configuration\n    └── migrations/              # Database migrations\n        └── unified_canvas_chat_system.sql   # Unified model migration\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe unified card-chat system works through these key components:\n\n1. **Database Schema**: Nodes and relationships as first-class entities\n2. **Node Store**: Centralized state management for all nodes and their relationships\n3. **Service Layer**: API for creating and managing nodes and relationships\n4. **UnifiedCardThread**: Component that represents both chat messages and canvas cards\n5. **ConnectionLayer**: Visualizes relationships between nodes\n6. **ChatPanel**: Interface for interacting with the system through text\n\nAll actions in either chat or canvas are synchronized to create a seamless experience.\n\n## Deploy on Vercel\n\nThe easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.\n\n===== CLAUDE.md =====\n\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.\n\n## Project Vision and Strategy\n\nCursive aims to transform how we interact with knowledge by combining relationship-centric design with AI-powered insights. Our goal is to create a system that:\n\n1. **Makes relationships primary entities** - Focusing on connections between ideas\n2. **Enables bidirectional interaction** - Seamlessly work with chat or spatial canvas\n3. **Creates meaningful connections** - Discovering and visualizing relationships between concepts\n4. **Supports vector properties** - Direction, intention, and state for active knowledge work\n5. **Unifies text and spatial thinking** - Allowing fluid movement between modalities\n6. **Prioritizes questions over templates** - Using questions as the central organizing principle\n7. **Enables knowledge sharing** - Creating a relationship-centric knowledge architecture\n\n## Core Architecture Update\n\nThe project has been updated with a relationship-centric architecture:\n\n### Relationship Triple Model\nThe fundamental unit is now a relationship triple:\n- Nodes (from and to) with content and type\n- Connection with type and vector properties\n- Vector with direction, intention, and state\n\n### Database Schema\n- New `nodes` table for questions, responses, notes, and drawings\n- New `relationships` table for connections between nodes\n- Migration function to convert existing conversations\n\n### Unified Components\n- `UnifiedCardThread` - Component for both chat messages and canvas cards\n- `UnifiedCanvasContainer` - Container for the new relationship-centric view\n- `NodeStore` - Zustand store for managing nodes and relationships\n- `ConnectionLayer` - Visualizes relationships between nodes\n\n## Common Commands\n\n### Development\n\n```bash\n# Run development server with Turbopack\nnpm run dev\n\n# Build for production\nnpm run build\n\n# Start production server\nnpm run start\n\n# Run linter\nnpm run lint\n\n# Fix database/run migrations\nnode tools/fix_database.js\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nThe app requires the following environment variables:\n\n```\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key  # Required for database migrations and fixes\n```\n\n## Database Setup\n\nWhen setting up the application for the first time or after schema changes, you may need to run database migrations. If you encounter errors like `relation \"public.nodes\" does not exist` or `relation \"public.relationships\" does not exist`, follow these steps:\n\n### Option 1: Using Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)\n1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard\n2. Go to the SQL Editor section\n3. Create a new query\n4. Copy and paste the contents of this file:\n   - `supabase/migrations/unified_canvas_chat_system.sql`\n5. Run the query\n\n### Option 2: Using Database Fix Scripts\n1. Ensure your SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY is set in .env.local\n2. Run: `node tools/fix_database.js`\n\nFor existing data, the migration script includes a function called `migrate_conversations_to_nodes()` that will convert your existing conversations to the new node-relationship model.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### Canvas System\nThe canvas is built using Konva.js and consists of several layers:\n- **DrawingLayer**: Handles pen strokes and eraser functionality\n- **ConnectionLayer**: Renders visual connections between related nodes\n- **UnifiedCardThread**: Represents both chat messages and canvas cards\n- **UnifiedCanvasContainer**: Main container for the new relationship-centric view\n\n### Node Model\nThe node model organizes content:\n- **Node**: A container for content with type (question, response, note, drawing)\n- **Relationship**: A connection between nodes with type and vector properties\n- **Vector**: Directional properties showing intention and state\n\n### Node Store\nThe Zustand store manages the state:\n- **nodes**: Record of all nodes indexed by ID\n- **relationships**: Array of all relationships\n- **nodePositions**: Record of node positions and UI state\n- **actions**: Methods for creating, updating, and deleting nodes and relationships\n\n### Service Layer\nThe service layer handles API operations:\n- **createNode**: Creates a new node in the database\n- **createRelationship**: Creates a new relationship in the database\n- **getNodesByNotebook**: Retrieves all nodes for a notebook\n- **getRelationshipsByNotebook**: Retrieves all relationships for a notebook\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\ncursive-app/\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── canvas/              # Canvas components\n│   │   │   ├── UnifiedCardThread.tsx      # Card-chat

└── unified_canvas_chat_system.sql  # Unified model migration\n```\n\n## TypeScript Best Practices\n\nWhen working with this codebase, follow these type safety patterns:\n\n### Node and Relationship Types\n\n```typescript\n// Always use the proper types from thread.ts\nimport { Node, Relationship, NodePosition } from '@/types/thread';\n\n// Use Record types for node collections\nconst nodes: Record<string, Node> = {};\n\n// Use proper type narrowing\nif (node.type === 'question') {\n  // Type-specific operations for questions\n}\n```\n\n### Zustand Store with Immer\n\n```typescript\n// Create store with immer middleware\nconst useNodeStore = create<NodeState>()(\n  immer((set, get) => ({\n    // State\n    nodes: {},\n    relationships: [],\n    \n    // Actions\n    addNode: (node) => set(state => {\n      // Immer allows \"mutating\" state\n      state.nodes[node.id] = node;\n    }),\n    \n    // Helper functions\n    getChildNodes: (nodeId: string) => {\n      const state = get();\n      // Implementation\n    }\n  }))\n);\n```\n\n## Relationship Model Implementation\n\nThe relationship model is implemented with two main database tables:\n\n### Nodes Table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE nodes (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),\n  content TEXT NOT NULL,\n  type TEXT NOT NULL,\n  attention JSONB DEFAULT '[]',\n  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',\n  notebook_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES notebooks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  position JSONB DEFAULT '{\"x\": 0, \"y\": 0}',\n  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),\n  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),\n  CONSTRAINT valid_node_type CHECK (type IN ('question', 'response', 'note', 'drawing'))\n);\n```\n\n### Relationships Table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE relationships (\n  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),\n  from_node_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  to_node_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  type TEXT NOT NULL,\n  context TEXT,\n  vector JSONB,\n  notebook_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES notebooks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),\n  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),\n  CONSTRAINT valid_relationship_type CHECK (type IN ('supports', 'contradicts', 'questions', 'extends', 'tensions'))\n);\n```\n\n## Component Design Philosophy\n\nWhen working with components in this project:\n\n1. **Relationship-Centric Design**:\n   - Components should focus on relationships between nodes\n   - Implement proper visualization of relationship types\n   - Support vector properties with direction and state\n\n2. **Unified Experience**:\n   - Components should work in both chat and canvas contexts\n   - Maintain a consistent interaction model across modalities\n   - Support seamless switching between views\n\n3. **Performance Optimization**:\n   - Use React.memo for all canvas components\n   - Implement useCallback with proper dependencies\n   - Use proper memoization for complex calculations\n\n4. **Event Handling**:\n   - Implement proper cancellation of event bubbling\n   - Handle drag operations correctly with start, move, and end events\n   - Maintain proper state during interactions\n\n## Code Generation Standards\n\nPlease generate TypeScript React code following these best practices:\n- Use the relationship-centric model for all new features\n- Follow the Node/Relationship type pattern in thread.ts\n- Use the nodeStore for state management\n- Implement proper memoization for canvas components\n- Handle errors appropriately for database operations\n- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions\n- Add prop types for all components\n- Maintain consistent naming patterns\n\nThe unified card-chat system represents a significant architectural evolution for the project, focusing on relationships as first-class entities and enabling seamless interaction through both chat and canvas interfaces.\n\n===== Directory Tree =====\n\n

Run `node tools/setup_fresh_relationship_db.js` to create fresh schema\n2. Use `--with-test-data` flag to seed sample data\n3. Start the application with `npm run dev`\n\nFor an incremental approach:\n\n1. Continue using existing data\n2. Gradually migrate to the new Node/Relationship model\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n1. Implement advanced relationship visualization\n2. Add vector-based filtering and searching\n3. Create pattern recognition for common relationship structures\n4. Build semantic analysis of related nodes\n5. Enhance collaborative features with real-time relationship updates"

      "content": "This error message is from your Cursive app and indicates an issue when trying to fetch strokes data from your Supabase database. The error `net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` typically suggests that the browser or system is running out of resources (like memory) when trying to make this network request.\n\nLet's analyze the specific error:\n\n1. The error occurs when fetching strokes for notebook ID \"322b82e5-6148-4ab3-8770-0f72cd2f0bc8\"\n2. The endpoint being hit is: `https://apqohdlicqtjhorxkywi.supabase.co/rest/v1/strokes?select=*&notebook_id=eq.322b82e5-6148-4ab3-8770-0f72cd2f0bc8&order=created_at.asc`\n3. The error `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` suggests the browser can't allocate enough resources to handle the response\n\nThis likely means one of the following:\n\n1. The strokes table for this notebook has TOO MANY ENTRIES, and the request is attempting to fetch them all at once, leading to a very large response\n2. The browser is running out of memory for other reasons\n3. There might be an infinite loop or similar issue in your code that's causing excessive resource consumption\n\nLet's think about potential solutions and improvements:\n\n### 1. Implement Pagination for Strokes\n\nInstead of fetching all strokes at once, implement pagination to fetch them in smaller batches:\n\n```typescript\n// Instead of:\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\n  .from('strokes')\n  .select('*')\n  .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n\n// Use:\nconst PAGE_SIZE = 100;\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\n  .from('strokes')\n  .select('*')\n  .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n  .order('created_at', { ascending: true })\n  .range(0, PAGE_SIZE - 1);\n\n// Then implement UI to load more as needed\n```\n\n### 2. Optimize Data Selection\n\nInstead of selecting all columns (`select=*`), only select the columns you need:\n\n```typescript\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\n  .from('strokes')\n  .select('id, points, tool, color, width, order_index')\n  .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n```\n\n### 3. Consider Data Batching or Compression\n\nFor notebooks with many strokes, consider:\n- Compressing stroke data on the server\n- Implementing a mechanism to batch fetch strokes (e.g., by area of the canvas currently visible)\n- Using WebSockets instead of REST for large dataset synchronization\n\n### 4. Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic\n\nImprove error handling to gracefully handle failures:\n\n```typescript\nconst fetchStrokes = async (retryCount = 0, maxRetries = 3) => {\n  try {\n    const { data, error } = await supabase\n      .from('strokes')\n      .select('id, points, tool, color, width')\n      .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n      .order('created_at', { ascending: true })\n      .range(0, 99); // Paginate\n      \n    if (error) throw error;\n    return data;\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(`Error fetching strokes (attempt ${retryCount + 1}):`, err);\n    \n    if (retryCount < maxRetries) {\n      // Exponential backoff\n      const delay = Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000;\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));\n      return fetchStrokes(retryCount + 1, maxRetries);\n    }\n    \n    // Final failure, but still provide a graceful experience\n    setError('Failed to load all drawing data. Some content may be missing.');\n    return []; // Return empty array instead of failing completely\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 5. Implement Lazy Loading or Virtualization\n\nInstead of loading all strokes at once, consider:\n- Loading strokes only for the visible viewport area\n- Creating a virtual canvas that loads/unloads strokes as the user pans\n- Implementing a lower-resolution version for zoomed-out views\n\n### 6. Refactor Data Model\n\nConsider revisiting your data model:\n- Combine multiple small strokes into larger stroke groups\n- Implement a quadtree or spatial index for efficient retrieval\n- Create a hierarchical structure (e.g., group strokes by area or time)\n\n### 7. Caching Strategy\n\nImplement proper caching:\n- Cache stroke data in localStorage or IndexedDB\n- Use a service worker to cache the API responses\n- Implement an intelligent sync strategy for changes\n\n### 8. Memory Optimization\n\nCheck for memory leaks in your canvas rendering code:\n- Ensure Konva objects are properly destroyed when no longer needed\n- Implement proper garbage collection for removed elements\n- Monitor memory usage during canvas operations\n\nBased on the files you provided, the issue is likely that your app is trying to load too many strokes at once for a large notebook. Let's draft some specific code suggestions based on your file structure.\n\nLooking at your code in the provided files:\n\n1. It seems like you're using Konva.js for canvas rendering\n2. You have a React-based component structure\n3. You're using Supabase for data storage and real-time updates\n\nGiven this knowledge, I'll make some specific recommendations to fix the issue and improve your application.# Debugging the Supabase Strokes Fetch Error\n\nThe error you're seeing (`net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`) indicates that your browser is running out of resources when trying to load all the strokes for this notebook. This usually happens when there are too many strokes being fetched in a single request.\n\n## Root Causes\n\n1. **Excessive Data Volume**: You're fetching all strokes at once with `select=*` without pagination\n2. **Inefficient Query**: Requesting all columns even if you don't need them all\n3. **Missing Optimization**: No lazy loading or virtualization for the canvas content\n\n## Solution Recommendations\n\n### 1. Implement Pagination for Strokes\n\n```typescript\n// Current problematic code (likely in a service or hook):\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\n  .from('strokes')\n  .select('*')\n  .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n\n// Replace with paginated approach:\nconst PAGE_SIZE = 500; // Adjust based on testing\nconst fetchStrokesPage = async (page = 0) => {\n  const start = page * PAGE_SIZE;\n  const end = start + PAGE_SIZE - 1;\n  \n  return supabase\n    .from('strokes')\n    .select('id, points, tool, color, width') // Only select needed fields\n    .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n    .order('created_at', { ascending: true })\n    .range(start, end);\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Implement Viewport-Based Loading\n\nOnly load strokes that are visible in the current viewport:\n\n```typescript\n// Add this to your canvas container component\nconst loadVisibleStrokes = async () => {\n  const viewport = {\n    x: position.x - (canvasWidth / scale / 2),\n    y: position.y - (canvasHeight / scale / 2),\n    width: canvasWidth / scale,\n    height: canvasHeight / scale\n  };\n  \n  // Optional: Add buffer zones around viewport\n  const buffer = 500;\n  const queryBounds = {\n    minX: viewport.x - buffer,\n    maxX: viewport.x + viewport.width + buffer,\n    minY: viewport.y - buffer,\n    maxY: viewport.y + viewport.height + buffer\n  };\n  \n  // This requires additional column in your DB or filtering client-side\n  // Simplified example - actual implementation depends on your data structure\n  const { data, error } = await supabase\n    .from('strokes')\n    .select('id, points, tool, color, width')\n    .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n    .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n    \n  // Client-side filtering based on stroke points\n  return data?.filter(stroke => {\n    // Check if any point is within viewport\n    return stroke.points.some(point => \n      point.x >= queryBounds.minX && \n      point.x <= queryBounds.maxX &&\n      point.y >= queryBounds.minY && \n      point.y <= queryBounds.maxY\n    );\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### 3. Optimize Your Data Model\n\nConsider modifying your database schema to support more efficient queries:\n\n```sql\n-- Add these to your strokes table\nALTER TABLE strokes ADD COLUMN bounds_min_x FLOAT;\nALTER TABLE strokes ADD COLUMN bounds_min_y FLOAT;\nALTER TABLE strokes ADD COLUMN bounds_max_x FLOAT;\nALTER TABLE strokes ADD COLUMN bounds_max_y FLOAT;\n\n-- Add an index for spatial queries\nCREATE INDEX idx_strokes_spatial ON strokes (notebook_id, bounds_min_x, bounds_min_y, bounds_max_x, bounds_max_y);\n```\n\nThen update your code to calculate and store bounds when saving strokes.\n\n### 4. Implement Better Error Handling\n\n```typescript\nconst fetchStrokes = async () => {\n  try {\n    // Your fetch logic here\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error fetching strokes:', err);\n    \n    // Show a user-friendly message\n    setError({\n      title: 'Error loading drawing data',\n      message: 'We encountered an issue loading the notebook. It may contain too much data.',\n      actions: [\n        { \n          label: 'Try again with less data', \n          onClick: () => fetchReducedQualityData() \n        }\n      ]\n    });\n    \n    // Fall back to a smaller dataset or empty state\n    return [];\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 5. Implement Caching\n\nAdd a caching layer to reduce repeated fetches:\n\n```typescript\n// In a custom hook or service\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport function useStrokesCache(notebookId) {\n  const [strokesCache, setStrokesCache] = useState({});\n  \n  // Check browser storage on init\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const cachedData = localStorage.getItem(`strokes_${notebookId}`);\n    if (cachedData) {\n      try {\n        setStrokesCache(JSON.parse(cachedData));\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.error('Failed to parse cached strokes');\n      }\n    }\n  }, [notebookId]);\n  \n  // Cache setter with storage\n  const updateCache = (regionKey, strokes) => {\n    setStrokesCache(prev => {\n      const updated = {...prev, [regionKey]: strokes};\n      localStorage.setItem(`strokes_${notebookId}`, JSON.stringify(updated));\n      return updated;\n    });\n  };\n  \n  return [strokesCache, updateCache];\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Code Cleanup Opportunities\n\nLooking at your file structure, I recommend:\n\n1. **Refactor `ResponsiveToolbar.tsx`**: It's quite large (700+ lines). Split it into smaller components.\n\n2. **Memory management in canvas components**: \n   - Make sure to clean up Konva objects when unmounting\n   - Use `React.memo` for components that don't need frequent re-renders \n   - Implement proper dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks\n\n3. **Optimize the authentication flow** in `AuthContext.tsx` to avoid unnecessary re-renders\n\n4. **Move to a more structured relationship model** as outlined in your `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n1. First implement pagination to get immediate relief from the error\n2. Next add viewport-based loading for better performance\n3. Add proper caching and error handling\n4. Finally, consider the data model changes for long-term scalability\n\nWould you like me to expand on any particular aspect of these solutions, or help implement a specific fix?",

Implement Pagination for Strokes\n\nInstead of fetching all strokes at once, implement pagination to fetch them in smaller batches:\n\n```typescript\n// Instead of:\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\n  .from('strokes')\n  .select('*')\n  .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n\n// Use:\nconst PAGE_SIZE = 100;\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\n  .from('strokes')\n  .select('*')\n  .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n  .order('created_at', { ascending: true })\n  .range(0, PAGE_SIZE - 1);\n\n// Then implement UI to load more as needed\n```\n\n### 2. Optimize Data Selection\n\nInstead of selecting all columns (`select=*`), only select the columns you need:\n\n```typescript\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\n  .from('strokes')\n  .select('id, points, tool, color, width, order_index')\n  .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n```\n\n### 3. Consider Data Batching or Compression\n\nFor notebooks with many strokes, consider:\n- Compressing stroke data on the server\n- Implementing a mechanism to batch fetch strokes (e.g., by area of the canvas currently visible)\n- Using WebSockets instead of REST for large dataset synchronization\n\n### 4. Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic\n\nImprove error handling to gracefully handle failures:\n\n```typescript\nconst fetchStrokes = async (retryCount = 0, maxRetries = 3) => {\n  try {\n    const { data, error } = await supabase\n      .from('strokes')\n      .select('id, points, tool, color, width')\n      .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n      .order('created_at', { ascending: true })\n      .range(0, 99); // Paginate\n      \n    if (error) throw error;\n    return data;\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(`Error fetching strokes (attempt ${retryCount + 1}):`, err);\n    \n    if (retryCount < maxRetries) {\n      // Exponential backoff\n      const delay = Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000;\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));\n      return fetchStrokes(retryCount + 1, maxRetries);\n    }\n    \n    // Final failure, but still provide a graceful experience\n    setError('Failed to load all drawing data. Some content may be missing.');\n    return []; // Return empty array instead of failing completely\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 5. Implement Lazy Loading or Virtualization\n\nInstead of loading all strokes at once, consider:\n- Loading strokes only for the visible viewport area\n- Creating a virtual canvas that loads/unloads strokes as the user pans\n- Implementing a lower-resolution version for zoomed-out views\n\n### 6. Refactor Data Model\n\nConsider revisiting your data model:\n- Combine multiple small strokes into larger stroke groups\n- Implement a quadtree or spatial index for efficient retrieval\n- Create a hierarchical structure (e.g., group strokes by area or time)\n\n### 7. Caching Strategy\n\nImplement proper caching:\n- Cache stroke data in localStorage or IndexedDB\n- Use a service worker to cache the API responses\n- Implement an intelligent sync strategy for changes\n\n### 8. Memory Optimization\n\nCheck for memory leaks in your canvas rendering code:\n- Ensure Konva objects are properly destroyed when no longer needed\n- Implement proper garbage collection for removed elements\n- Monitor memory usage during canvas operations\n\nBased on the files you provided, the issue is likely that your app is trying to load too many strokes at once for a large notebook. Let's draft some specific code suggestions based on your file structure.\n\nLooking at your code in the provided files:\n\n1. It seems like you're using Konva.js for canvas rendering\n2. You have a React-based component structure\n3. You're using Supabase for data storage and real-time updates\n\nGiven this knowledge, I'll make some specific recommendations to fix the issue and improve your application.",

            "text": "# Debugging the Supabase Strokes Fetch Error\n\nThe error you're seeing (`net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`) indicates that your browser is running out of resources when trying to load all the strokes for this notebook. This usually happens when there are too many strokes being fetched in a single request.\n\n## Root Causes\n\n1. **Excessive Data Volume**: You're fetching all strokes at once with `select=*` without pagination\n2. **Inefficient Query**: Requesting all columns even if you don't need them all\n3. **Missing Optimization**: No lazy loading or virtualization for the canvas content\n\n## Solution Recommendations\n\n### 1. Implement Pagination for Strokes\n\n```typescript\n// Current problematic code (likely in a service or hook):\nconst { data, error } = await supabase\n  .from('strokes')\n  .select('*')\n  .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n  .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n\n// Replace with paginated approach:\nconst PAGE_SIZE = 500; // Adjust based on testing\nconst fetchStrokesPage = async (page = 0) => {\n  const start = page * PAGE_SIZE;\n  const end = start + PAGE_SIZE - 1;\n  \n  return supabase\n    .from('strokes')\n    .select('id, points, tool, color, width') // Only select needed fields\n    .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n    .order('created_at', { ascending: true })\n    .range(start, end);\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Implement Viewport-Based Loading\n\nOnly load strokes that are visible in the current viewport:\n\n```typescript\n// Add this to your canvas container component\nconst loadVisibleStrokes = async () => {\n  const viewport = {\n    x: position.x - (canvasWidth / scale / 2),\n    y: position.y - (canvasHeight / scale / 2),\n    width: canvasWidth / scale,\n    height: canvasHeight / scale\n  };\n  \n  // Optional: Add buffer zones around viewport\n  const buffer = 500;\n  const queryBounds = {\n    minX: viewport.x - buffer,\n    maxX: viewport.x + viewport.width + buffer,\n    minY: viewport.y - buffer,\n    maxY: viewport.y + viewport.height + buffer\n  };\n  \n  // This requires additional column in your DB or filtering client-side\n  // Simplified example - actual implementation depends on your data structure\n  const { data, error } = await supabase\n    .from('strokes')\n    .select('id, points, tool, color, width')\n    .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n    .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n    \n  // Client-side filtering based on stroke points\n  return data?.filter(stroke => {\n    // Check if any point is within viewport\n    return stroke.points.some(point => \n      point.x >= queryBounds.minX && \n      point.x <= queryBounds.maxX &&\n      point.y >= queryBounds.minY && \n      point.y <= queryBounds.maxY\n    );\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### 3. Optimize Your Data Model\n\nConsider modifying your database schema to support more efficient queries:\n\n```sql\n-- Add these to your strokes table\nALTER TABLE strokes ADD COLUMN bounds_min_x FLOAT;\nALTER TABLE strokes ADD COLUMN bounds_min_y FLOAT;\nALTER TABLE strokes ADD COLUMN bounds_max_x FLOAT;\nALTER TABLE strokes ADD COLUMN bounds_max_y FLOAT;\n\n-- Add an index for spatial queries\nCREATE INDEX idx_strokes_spatial ON strokes (notebook_id, bounds_min_x, bounds_min_y, bounds_max_x, bounds_max_y);\n```\n\nThen update your code to calculate and store bounds when saving strokes.\n\n### 4. Implement Better Error Handling\n\n```typescript\nconst fetchStrokes = async () => {\n  try {\n    // Your fetch logic here\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Error fetching strokes:', err);\n    \n    // Show a user-friendly message\n    setError({\n      title: 'Error loading drawing data',\n      message: 'We encountered an issue loading the notebook. It may contain too much data.',\n      actions: [\n        { \n          label: 'Try again with less data', \n          onClick: () => fetchReducedQualityData() \n        }\n      ]\n    });\n    \n    // Fall back to a smaller dataset or empty state\n    return [];\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### 5. Implement Caching\n\nAdd a caching layer to reduce repeated fetches:\n\n```typescript\n// In a custom hook or service\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\n\nexport function useStrokesCache(notebookId) {\n  const [strokesCache, setStrokesCache] = useState({});\n  \n  // Check browser storage on init\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const cachedData = localStorage.getItem(`strokes_${notebookId}`);\n    if (cachedData) {\n      try {\n        setStrokesCache(JSON.parse(cachedData));\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.error('Failed to parse cached strokes');\n      }\n    }\n  }, [notebookId]);\n  \n  // Cache setter with storage\n  const updateCache = (regionKey, strokes) => {\n    setStrokesCache(prev => {\n      const updated = {...prev, [regionKey]: strokes};\n      localStorage.setItem(`strokes_${notebookId}`, JSON.stringify(updated));\n      return updated;\n    });\n  };\n  \n  return [strokesCache, updateCache];\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Code Cleanup Opportunities\n\nLooking at your file structure, I recommend:\n\n1. **Refactor `ResponsiveToolbar.tsx`**: It's quite large (700+ lines). Split it into smaller components.\n\n2. **Memory management in canvas components**: \n   - Make sure to clean up Konva objects when unmounting\n   - Use `React.memo` for components that don't need frequent re-renders \n   - Implement proper dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks\n\n3. **Optimize the authentication flow** in `AuthContext.tsx` to avoid unnecessary re-renders\n\n4. **Move to a more structured relationship model** as outlined in your `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n1. First implement pagination to get immediate relief from the error\n2. Next add viewport-based loading for better performance\n3. Add proper caching and error handling\n4. Finally, consider the data model changes for long-term scalability\n\nWould you like me to expand on any particular aspect of these solutions, or help implement a specific fix?",

      "content": "I see the issue now. Based on the logs, it's not about the volume of strokes, but rather a different problem:\n\n1. The DrawingLayer is continuously fetching strokes for the same notebook over and over, despite getting back 0 strokes each time.\n2. Each fetch log shows \"attempt 1\" which suggests there might be a retry logic that's getting triggered repeatedly.\n3. The nodeStore also shows it's successfully loading 0 nodes and 0 relationships multiple times.\n\nThis looks like an infinite loop or a component re-rendering issue. Let's analyze potential causes:\n\n### Possible Causes:\n\n1. **Dependency Array Issues**: There might be a missing or changing dependency in a useEffect causing continuous re-fetching.\n\n2. **State Updates Triggering Re-renders**: A state update in a render cycle could be causing continuous re-rendering.\n\n3. **Title Setting Loop**: As mentioned, there could be an issue with how the title is being set. If setting the title causes a re-render which then tries to set the title again, you'd get a loop.\n\n4. **Multiple Instances of DrawingLayer**: There could be multiple instances of the DrawingLayer component being mounted, each trying to fetch strokes.\n\n5. **Real-time Subscription Issue**: If you're using Supabase's real-time feature, there might be a subscription triggering multiple fetches.\n\nLet's look at some potential solutions:\n\n### Solution for Title Setting Loop:\n\nIf the issue is related to title setting, we need to modify how the title is being managed to prevent the loop. Since you mentioned the initial question can be the title, we should set it once and then only update when explicitly changed.\n\nLet's examine what might be happening in ResponsiveToolbar.tsx and related components.# Fixing the Infinite Fetch Loop in DrawingLayer\n\nBased on your logs, this is definitely a render cycle issue rather than a data volume problem. You're right about it being related to the title setting - there's a loop happening where title updates trigger re-renders which trigger more fetches.\n\n## Root Causes\n\n1. **Title Update Loop**: The component is updating the title repeatedly, causing re-renders\n2. **Missing Dependency Checks**: useEffect hooks likely have incomplete dependency arrays\n3. **Multiple Component Instances**: Either multiple DrawingLayer instances or a parent component remounting frequently\n\n## Immediate Fixes\n\n### 1. Fix the Title Update Cycle in ResponsiveToolbar.tsx\n\n```typescript\n// In ResponsiveToolbar.tsx\n// Current problematic code (around line 170-180):\nuseEffect(() => {\n  console.log(\"ResponsiveToolbar: notebookTitle changed to:\", notebookTitle);\n  setTitle(notebookTitle);\n}, [notebookTitle]);\n\n// Replace with:\nuseEffect(() => {\n  // Only update title if notebookTitle exists and is different\n  if (notebookTitle && notebookTitle !== title) {\n    console.log(\"ResponsiveToolbar: updating title to:\", notebookTitle);\n    setTitle(notebookTitle);\n  }\n}, [notebookTitle, title]);\n```\n\n### 2. Fix DrawingLayer Fetch Logic\n\n```typescript\n// In DrawingLayer.tsx\n// Current problematic code (around line 60-70):\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchStrokes();\n}, [notebookId]); // Missing dependencies could cause re-fetching\n\n// Replace with:\nuseEffect(() => {\n  let isMounted = true;\n  let fetchAttempt = 0;\n  const maxAttempts = 3;\n  \n  const fetchStrokesWithLimit = async () => {\n    if (fetchAttempt >= maxAttempts) {\n      console.log(`Reached max fetch attempts (${maxAttempts}) for notebook ${notebookId}`);\n      return;\n    }\n    \n    fetchAttempt++;\n    console.log(`Fetching strokes for notebook ${notebookId}, attempt ${fetchAttempt}`);\n    \n    try {\n      const { data, error } = await supabase\n        .from('strokes')\n        .select('id, points, tool, color, width') // Only needed fields\n        .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n        .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n        \n      if (error) throw error;\n      \n      // Only update state if component is still mounted\n      if (isMounted) {\n        setStrokes(data || []);\n        // Set a \"loaded\" flag to prevent further fetches\n        setStrokesLoaded(true);\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Error fetching strokes:', err);\n      if (isMounted) {\n        setError(err);\n      }\n    }\n  };\n  \n  if (notebookId && !strokesLoaded) {\n    fetchStrokesWithLimit();\n  }\n  \n  return () => {\n    isMounted = false;\n  };\n}, [notebookId, strokesLoaded]); // Add proper dependencies\n```\n\n### 3. Add State for Tracking Loaded Status\n\n```typescript\n// In DrawingLayer.tsx component\nconst [strokesLoaded, setStrokesLoaded] = useState(false);\n\n// Reset loaded state if notebook changes\nuseEffect(() => {\n  setStrokesLoaded(false);\n}, [notebookId]);\n```\n\n## Broader Improvements\n\n### 1. Combine Title and Initial Question\n\nSince you mentioned that the initial question can be the title:\n\n```typescript\n// New function in your notebook creation flow\nconst createNotebookWithQuestion = async (questionText) => {\n  // Create notebook with question as title\n  const { data: notebook, error: notebookError } = await supabase\n    .from('notebooks')\n    .insert({\n      title: questionText.substring(0, 100), // Limit title length\n      user_id: user.id,\n      // other fields\n    })\n    .select()\n    .single();\n    \n  if (notebookError) throw notebookError;\n  \n  // Create first question node\n  const { data: node, error: nodeError } = await supabase\n    .from('nodes')\n    .insert({\n      content: questionText,\n      type: 'question',\n      notebook_id: notebook.id,\n      // other fields\n    })\n    .select()\n    .single();\n    \n  if (nodeError) throw nodeError;\n  \n  return { notebook, node };\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Improve State Management\n\nYour app would benefit from a more centralized state management approach:\n\n```typescript\n// In a new file: src/hooks/useNotebookState.js\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { supabase } from '@/lib/supabaseClient';\n\nexport function useNotebookState(notebookId) {\n  const [notebook, setNotebook] = useState(null);\n  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState([]);\n  const [relationships, setRelationships] = useState([]);\n  const [strokes, setStrokes] = useState([]);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n  \n  // Fetch notebook data once\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let isMounted = true;\n    \n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      if (!notebookId) return;\n      \n      setLoading(true);\n      try {\n        // Parallel fetching\n        const [notebookResult, nodesResult, relationsResult, strokesResult] = await Promise.all([\n          supabase.from('notebooks').select('*').eq('id', notebookId).single(),\n          supabase.from('nodes').select('*').eq('notebook_id', notebookId),\n          supabase.from('relationships').select('*').eq('notebook_id', notebookId),\n          supabase.from('strokes').select('*').eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n        ]);\n        \n        if (isMounted) {\n          if (notebookResult.error) throw notebookResult.error;\n          setNotebook(notebookResult.data);\n          setNodes(nodesResult.data || []);\n          setRelationships(relationsResult.data || []);\n          setStrokes(strokesResult.data || []);\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      } catch (err) {\n        console.error('Error fetching notebook data:', err);\n        if (isMounted) {\n          setError(err);\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      }\n    };\n    \n    fetchData();\n    \n    return () => {\n      isMounted = false;\n    };\n  }, [notebookId]);\n  \n  // Update title function\n  const updateTitle = useCallback(async (newTitle) => {\n    if (!notebook) return false;\n    \n    try {\n      const { error } = await supabase\n        .from('notebooks')\n        .update({ title: newTitle })\n        .eq('id', notebookId);\n        \n      if (error) throw error;\n      \n      // Optimistic update\n      setNotebook(prev => prev ? {...prev, title: newTitle} : null);\n      return true;\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Error updating title:', err);\n      return false;\n    }\n  }, [notebook, notebookId]);\n  \n  return {\n    notebook,\n    nodes,\n    relationships,\n    strokes,\n    loading,\n    error,\n    updateTitle\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Recommendations\n\n1. **Debounce Title Updates**: Only send title updates to the server after a delay:\n\n```typescript\nimport { useDebouncedCallback } from 'use-debounce';\n\n// In your component\nconst debouncedTitleUpdate = useDebouncedCallback(async (title) => {\n  await updateTitle(title);\n}, 500); // 500ms delay\n\n// Then use this instead of direct updateTitle calls\n```\n\n2. **Use React DevTools Profiler**: To identify components that are re-rendering too often\n\n3. **Refactor DrawingLayer.tsx**: \n   - Split it into smaller components\n   - Add proper memoization\n   - Consider using virtual rendering for strokes\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these solutions or help troubleshoot a specific part of the implementation!",

The DrawingLayer is continuously fetching strokes for the same notebook over and over, despite getting back 0 strokes each time.\n2. Each fetch log shows \"attempt 1\" which suggests there might be a retry logic that's getting triggered repeatedly.\n3. The nodeStore also shows it's successfully loading 0 nodes and 0 relationships multiple times.\n\nThis looks like an infinite loop or a component re-rendering issue. Let's analyze potential causes:\n\n### Possible Causes:\n\n1. **Dependency Array Issues**: There might be a missing or changing dependency in a useEffect causing continuous re-fetching.\n\n2. **State Updates Triggering Re-renders**: A state update in a render cycle could be causing continuous re-rendering.\n\n3. **Title Setting Loop**: As mentioned, there could be an issue with how the title is being set. If setting the title causes a re-render which then tries to set the title again, you'd get a loop.\n\n4. **Multiple Instances of DrawingLayer**: There could be multiple instances of the DrawingLayer component being mounted, each trying to fetch strokes.\n\n5. **Real-time Subscription Issue**: If you're using Supabase's real-time feature, there might be a subscription triggering multiple fetches.\n\nLet's look at some potential solutions:\n\n### Solution for Title Setting Loop:\n\nIf the issue is related to title setting, we need to modify how the title is being managed to prevent the loop. Since you mentioned the initial question can be the title, we should set it once and then only update when explicitly changed.\n\nLet's examine what might be happening in ResponsiveToolbar.tsx and related components.",

You're right about it being related to the title setting - there's a loop happening where title updates trigger re-renders which trigger more fetches.\n\n## Root Causes\n\n1. **Title Update Loop**: The component is updating the title repeatedly, causing re-renders\n2. **Missing Dependency Checks**: useEffect hooks likely have incomplete dependency arrays\n3. **Multiple Component Instances**: Either multiple DrawingLayer instances or a parent component remounting frequently\n\n## Immediate Fixes\n\n### 1. Fix the Title Update Cycle in ResponsiveToolbar.tsx\n\n```typescript\n// In ResponsiveToolbar.tsx\n// Current problematic code (around line 170-180):\nuseEffect(() => {\n  console.log(\"ResponsiveToolbar: notebookTitle changed to:\", notebookTitle);\n  setTitle(notebookTitle);\n}, [notebookTitle]);\n\n// Replace with:\nuseEffect(() => {\n  // Only update title if notebookTitle exists and is different\n  if (notebookTitle && notebookTitle !== title) {\n    console.log(\"ResponsiveToolbar: updating title to:\", notebookTitle);\n    setTitle(notebookTitle);\n  }\n}, [notebookTitle, title]);\n```\n\n### 2. Fix DrawingLayer Fetch Logic\n\n```typescript\n// In DrawingLayer.tsx\n// Current problematic code (around line 60-70):\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchStrokes();\n}, [notebookId]); // Missing dependencies could cause re-fetching\n\n// Replace with:\nuseEffect(() => {\n  let isMounted = true;\n  let fetchAttempt = 0;\n  const maxAttempts = 3;\n  \n  const fetchStrokesWithLimit = async () => {\n    if (fetchAttempt >= maxAttempts) {\n      console.log(`Reached max fetch attempts (${maxAttempts}) for notebook ${notebookId}`);\n      return;\n    }\n    \n    fetchAttempt++;\n    console.log(`Fetching strokes for notebook ${notebookId}, attempt ${fetchAttempt}`);\n    \n    try {\n      const { data, error } = await supabase\n        .from('strokes')\n        .select('id, points, tool, color, width') // Only needed fields\n        .eq('notebook_id', notebookId)\n        .order('created_at', { ascending: true });\n        \n      if (error) throw error;\n      \n      // Only update state if component is still mounted\n      if (isMounted) {\n        setStrokes(data || []);\n        // Set a \"loaded\" flag to prevent further fetches\n        setStrokesLoaded(true);\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Error fetching strokes:', err);\n      if (isMounted) {\n        setError(err);\n      }\n    }\n  };\n  \n  if (notebookId && !strokesLoaded) {\n    fetchStrokesWithLimit();\n  }\n  \n  return () => {\n    isMounted = false;\n  };\n}, [notebookId, strokesLoaded]); // Add proper dependencies\n```\n\n### 3. Add State for Tracking Loaded Status\n\n```typescript\n// In DrawingLayer.tsx component\nconst [strokesLoaded, setStrokesLoaded] = useState(false);\n\n// Reset loaded state if notebook changes\nuseEffect(() => {\n  setStrokesLoaded(false);\n}, [notebookId]);\n```\n\n## Broader Improvements\n\n### 1.
