      "content": "Here are some suggestions and critiques for your wellbeing and engagement assessment:\n\n1. The categories and questions you have cover many important areas of wellbeing, including accomplishment, engagement, happiness, health, meaning, relationships, emotions, work-life balance, work environment, personal growth, values alignment, social support, mindset, financial stability, and political/social context. This is a very comprehensive list and should provide a lot of insight into contributors and detractors of wellbeing for the target group.\n\n2. Some categories that may be useful to add or expand on include:\n\n- Resilience and coping: Questions around how people deal with challenges, setbacks, and adversity. This is particularly relevant for entrepreneurs and in uncertain political/social contexts. \n\n- Autonomy and control: Questions related to the level of independence, influence, and control people feel they have over their work and lives. Lack of autonomy is linked to lower wellbeing and engagement.\n\n- Workload and burnout: More questions specifically targeting workload, work-life balance, and symptoms of burnout like exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced efficacy. Burnout is a major risk for entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs. \n\n- Purpose and impact: Additional questions related to the meaning, purpose, and impact of people's work. Having a strong sense of purpose is key for wellbeing and engagement in these target groups.\n\n3. Be cautious about framing questions in a way that implies respondents are solely responsible for their wellbeing or work situations. Use neutral and open-ended framing to avoid an implicit \"bootstrap mentality\". For example, instead of \"How often do you feel overwhelmed by your workload?\" you could ask \"How often do you feel your workload is overwhelming?\". Subtle changes like this can make a difference.\n\n4. It may be useful to include some open-ended qualitative questions to provide context and capture experiences that may be missed in the closed-ended questions. For example, you could ask something like \"What are the biggest challenges you currently face in your work or personal life?\" or \"What resources or support do you wish you had more access to?\". \n\n5. Consider framing this assessment as a \"wellbeing and engagement survey\" rather than a \"modification of PERMAH\". Referring to an established model like PERMAH may create unrealistic expectations about what is covered and imply a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Your survey is quite comprehensive and tailored to your target groups, so it stands on its own.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful as you further develop your wellbeing and engagement assessment. Please let me know if you have any other questions!",

The additional questions should also provide more nuanced insight into this component of wellbeing and engagement for social entrepreneurs.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like any clarification or have additional questions!
