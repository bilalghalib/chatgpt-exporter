  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is developing a comprehensive solar training program for Iraq, specifically Module 1 focused on system design and installation. They had created initial materials including PDF and text versions of training slides with timestamps, but wanted to remove unprofessional elements like \"trainer slowly looks up at the room\" and other informal language to make the content more polished. The user requested help creating a complete facilitator guide, supplementary materials, and Excel workbook integration that would be rich in technical content, deep in practical application, fun through engagement, and easy for facilitators to deliver.\n\nClaude provided an extensive package of training materials including a professional facilitator guide structured around a \"Learn-Apply-Sell\" framework for 5-day training sessions. The materials were specifically tailored for the Iraqi market with considerations for Mosul conditions, IQD currency, 49°C temperature derating, and local business examples like Ahmed's Coffee Shop. The user specifically requested CSV files for Excel workbook tabs with embedded formulas, slide-to-Excel mapping, preparation checklists for datasheets and images, and printable website resources for trainer toolkits and games.\n\nClaude delivered ten complete CSV files with embedded Excel formulas covering load calculations, cost-curve analysis, mounting and installation costing, wire sizing calculations, system design tools, financial projections, PVWatts data integration, troubleshooting checklists, business development tracking, and certification progress monitoring. Each CSV included sophisticated formulas using functions like VLOOKUP, NPV, IRR, and conditional logic that would calculate automatically upon import. The materials also included comprehensive preparation checklists specifying exact datasheets to download from manufacturers like Longi Solar and Huawei, images to capture for safety demonstrations and quality comparisons, and detailed slide-to-Excel mapping showing which training slides integrate with which workbook tabs. Additionally, Claude created printable HTML websites containing trainer resource toolkits with quick reference cards, safety protocols, station checklists, and interactive training games designed for technical skill building and engagement.",

Optimal tilt depends on\nlocation and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is\n32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best\norientation.\n\n74\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other\nstructures can block sunlight from reaching\nsolar panels. Even partial shading\nsignificantly reduces power output, as the\nentire string performance drops to that of\nthe shaded panel. To maximize energy\nproduction year-round, it's important to\navoid shaded spots when installing solar\npanels.\n\n75\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\n1. What is the peak load? (in Amps)\n2. What is the average load? (in Amps)\n3. What is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\n4. What is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\n5. What is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\n6. How many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries\nwithout other input sources?)\n7. Is there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\n8. What is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar\ninstallation.\n9. What is the direction of true south?\n10. What are the building’s operating hours?\n11. How many days per week is the building operational?\n12. What type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\n13. Are there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\n14.

You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action?

The first two are Learn: by mid-morning you’ll be able to identify every PV component on the table and interpret Voc, Isc, and temperature coefficients from a datasheet.\nThen in Apply, you’ll calculate a real family’s load in amps and kilowatt-hours—and practice our zero-injury lock-out pledge on actual panels.\nFinally, in Sell, you’ll use those numbers to compare generator vs solar ROI and record a quick 1-minute pitch.\nFeel free to refer back to these as we go—each objective aligns to our Learn-Apply-Sell rhythm.”\n\nSafety First\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nGoal: 0 accidents all week\n(Share Ali’s story) \n⚠️ Isolate circuit — lock-out tag & padlock\n⚠️ Verify zero volts (DC first) with multimeter\n⚠️ Wear gloves & safety glasses\n⚠️ When work in electricity combine another person with you.\n⚠️ Use isolated tools while working in electricity.\n⚠️ One person shouts \"CLEAR!\" before reconnect\n⚠️ Never touch a live DC string\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nOpening Hook (30 s):\n“Before we jump in, I want to remind everyone why safety is non-negotiable. Last month, our colleague Ali got an accident with electricity because [the detailed story to be confirmed].”\n[Show a brief photo if available]\nLesson from Ali’s Story (45 s):\n“Ali admitted later that he needs to pay attention to [the detailed mistake to be confirmed].”\n“We don’t want ‘it always works’—we want zero incidents.”\nStep-by-Step Safety Ritual (1 min):\nIsolate: “First, open the breaker and hang the lock-out tag and padlock. That tag must read your name and time.”\nTest for Zero Volts: “Always grab your multimeter, set it to DC volts, and verify zero at both panel junction and inverter input.”\nPPE On: “Gloves and safety glasses stay on from start to finish—no exceptions.”\nBuddy System: “Never work alone. Your partner watches your back, hands you tools, and calls out if they see anything unsafe.”\nInsulated Tools: “Only use insulated screwdrivers, pliers, and cutters.

Think of these as your solar-survival kit.”\nVoc (Open-circuit voltage):\u000b “This is the maximum voltage your panel can spit out when nothing’s hooked up. It’s critical because your inverter has a voltage ceiling—stay below it or you risk damage.”\nIsc (Short-circuit current):\u000b “This is the peak current if you directly short the panel leads. We never actually do that—except in testing—but it tells us how big of a fuse and cable we need to keep everything safe.”\nTemp-coef (Temperature coefficient):\u000b “Panels lose power as they heat up. A typical value is –0.35 % per °C, so on a 60 °C roof you might be 7 % down just from heat. In Mosul, that adds up fast—always factor it in.”\nAzimuth (East/West offset):\u000b “Azimuth tells us which way the panels face: 0° is true south, –90° is east, +90° is west. Even a 15° error can cost you a few percent of annual energy.”\nTilt (β):\u000b “That’s the angle from horizontal—think of it like tilting your panel to chase the sun. At our latitude we use around 30°, but small tweaks bump up winter versus summer yield.”\nPeak-Sun-Hour:\u000b “This compresses sun intensity into ‘hours of full sun per day.’ If Mosul averages 5 kWh/m²/day, one kWp of panels makes about 5 kWh each day.”\nkWh ↔ Amp conversion:\u000b “To turn a device’s current draw into energy: Amps × Volts × Hours ÷ 1000 = kWh.

Explain the task (30 s):\n“On each sheet you’ll find a sea of numbers. Our goal in the field is to spot three key specs in under a minute. Today those are:\n  • Voc: the panel’s open-circuit voltage (think of it as the “pressure” it can build when nothing’s attached).\n  • Isc: the short-circuit current (the maximum “flow” if you directly connect the leads).\n  • Temp-coef: how much power changes with temperature (for example, –0.35 % per °C, so panels lose a bit of output when they get hot).”\n\n3. Analogy (30 s):\n“Imagine Voc is like the highest pressure in a water hose when the nozzle is closed. Isc is the flood of water if you remove the nozzle completely. Temp-coef is how much that water flow drops when the hose gets hot in the sun.”\n\n4. Countdown & roam (30 s + 1 min):\n“Ready?

Solar panels work best when sunlight hits them directly. Optimal tilt depends on location and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is 32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best orientation.\nFacilitator notes:\u000b “Okay, team—let’s talk about tilt and azimuth.\n‘Tilt’ is just how much you tip your panel up from flat ground. If it’s too flat, you miss low-angle winter sun; too steep, you lose high summer sun. In Mosul we aim for 32 to 36 degrees—that balance gives us the most energy year-round.\n‘Azimuth’ means the compass direction the panel faces. 0 degrees is true south, which gets the highest sun all day. A few degrees east or west are okay, but aim as close to south as you can.\n\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other structures can block sunlight from reaching solar panels. Even partial shading significantly reduces power output, as the entire string performance drops to that of the shaded panel. To maximize energy production year-round, it's important to avoid shaded spots when installing solar panels.\nFacilitator notes:\u000b “Next up: shading. This is a solar killer.\nAny time a bit of your panel is shaded, the whole string of panels drops in power—like a traffic jam on your roof.\nSee that tree branch on the right? That tiny stripe of shade can cost you 20 to 30 percent of your daily energy.\n\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\nWhat is the peak load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\nWhat is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\nHow many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries without other input sources?)\nIs there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\nWhat is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar installation.\nWhat is the direction of true south?\nWhat are the building’s operating hours?\nHow many days per week is the building operational?\nWhat type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\nAre there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\nAny additional information?\nFacilitator notes: \n\u000b “Here’s your Field Survey Checklist—twelve key questions you always ask on any new rooftop. Today, we’ll practice using it.\nActivity Instructions:\nI need you in your teams to choose one nearby roof—your house, or the building next door.\nTake five minutes to answer the first six questions on the left in jot-form on a sticky note:\nPeak and average amps, future growth, grid availability, system type, and battery autonomy.\nAlso note any shading obstacles you spot—trees, pipes, walls.\u000b\nGo!

Next to it, the ‘Dusty’ bar falls to roughly 85 percent—a tangible loss that erodes your ROI faster every month.”\u000b\nMaintenance Solution (30 s)\u000b “The good news?

Under-torque and the next big gust will loosen your rails, risking misalignment and damage.\nHands-on tip: When you hear that “click,” stop turning—over-torque can strip threads.

A drilled hole and raw bolt aren’t enough in concrete—dust, heat, and vibration degrade simple expansion anchors. Instead, follow these four steps:\nDrill a 12 mm hole and blow out any dust.\nInject epoxy-based chemical anchor, filling the hole.\nInsert the threaded rod and leave it to cure for 24 hours.\nTighten the nut to 25 Nm—this torque drives resin into every crevice.\u000b\nFinally: Extra Wind-Load Notes.\nApply sealant tape along the rail slots to protect against dust infiltration and corrosion.\nOn the windward edge, use edge clamps or anti-uplift brackets to boost your pull-out resistance by an additional 20 %.\nNow, look at these real-world failure examples:\nPhoto A: anchor cured in dusty hole—notice the crack around the mount where the bond failed.\nPhoto B: panels bowed outwards because no expansion gap let them press against each other under heat.\nPhoto C: rusty slot-clips—dust trapped moisture and ate through the aluminum.\u000b\nActivity prompt (30 s):\u000b “Before we move on, turn to your neighbor and name one step of the chemical anchor process you’ve never done before. Go!”\n[After 30 s pair-share]\n“Great—let’s carry these mounting best practices into Station 1 of our Apply block, where you’ll assemble and torque the rails on a mock roof section with proper gaps and anchors.”\n\nDC Connection Perfection\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nStep 1\nStrip Cable\n(8 mm insulation)\nStep 2\nInsert Pin\n(fully home)\n*Photo A: cleanly stripped PV cable\n*Photo B: pin inserted to shoulder\nStep 3\nCrimp\n(18 Nm torque)\nStep 4\nPull-Test\n(≥ 150 N retention)\n*Photo C: crimper on pin, listen for “click”\n*Photo D: pull-tester reading ≥ 150 N\nFacilitator notes:\n[After reviewing mounting, trainer transitions:]\u000b “Before you head to the MC4 crimp stations, let’s lock down the perfect DC-connection ritual—because a bad crimp is more than a loose wire, it’s a fire hazard. In fact, up to 80 percent of rooftop fires start right here at the connectors.\nStep 1: Strip Cable\nGoal: expose exactly 8 mm of bare conductor. Too little and your pin won’t seat; too much and strands get nicked.\nTip: use the dedicated PV cable stripper’s stop gauge. You should see every strand intact.\u000b\nStep 2: Insert Pin\nGoal: slide the MC4 pin fully onto the exposed conductor until it locks at the shoulder.\nCheck: the gold-plated shoulder should be flush with the insulation’s edge. No copper should peek out.\u000b\nStep 3: Crimp\nGoal: use your ratchet crimper set to 18 Nm.\nListen: the “click” tells you you’ve hit the target torque—stop immediately to avoid over-crimping.\u000b\nStep 4: Pull-Test\nGoal: verify a retention force of at least 150 Newtons (about 15 kgf).\nProcedure: clamp the connector in the pull-tester jaws and steadily pull until you see the reading. Anything under 150 N means re-crimp.\u000b\nMini Activity (1 min):\u000b “Turn to your neighbor and quiz them: ‘What’s the one audible cue you listen for during crimping?’\u000b Go!”\n[30 s pair-share]\n“Exactly—the ratchet click. If you don’t hear it, you haven’t hit 18 Nm. Keep this slide in view as you rotate into Station 1, then Station 4—where you’ll practice MC4 crimps and pull-tests under the clock. Safe connections make safe rooftops. Let’s go!”\n\nHaykal Mounting Frame – Key Checks\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nKit frame (bolt-together) vs welded steel  \nTorque spec 18 Nm \nMust resist wind-load ≥ 1.5 kN/m² on Mosul roofs\nFacilitator notes:\nFrame Options (45 s)\u000b “On the left you see the bolt-together kit—quick to assemble with basic tools—and on the right a fully welded steel bracket. The kit is fastest on site; the welded frame can be stronger but costs more in labour.”\u000b\nTorque Spec (30 s)\u000b “Every M8 bolt must be tightened to 18 Nm—just like on your MC4 and rail-mount tasks. Under-torque risks loosening; over-torque can strip threads.”\u000b\nWind-Load Calculation (60 s)\u000b “Mosul’s design wind pressure is 1.5 kN/m², which translates to about 150 kgf per m² of panel area: \nF = Pressure × Area  \nF = 1 500 N/m² × 1 m² ≈ 1 500 N ≈ 150 kgf  \nThat’s why we limit rail spans to 1.5 m—to keep bending loads within safe limits—and why in Tab 3 of your workbook you’ll price extra brackets or gussets so your kit stays solid in a storm.”\u000b\nTransition to Apply (30 s)\u000b “Now let’s head to our framing station, where you’ll practice bolting the kit rails to a mock roof section, torque them to 18 Nm, and sketch where extra brackets go. Grab your torque wrench and Workbook Tab 3—let’s go!”\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nRooftop Hazards & PPE\n🪜 Ladder at 75°: “Set ladder at a 75° angle for stability.”\n\n🪢 Harness & Anchor: “Always wear a fall-arrest harness clipped to a certified anchor.”\n\n🥽🧤 Gloves & Goggles: “Insulated gloves and safety glasses on at all times.”\nFacilitator notes:\n“Okay team, before we climb any more roofs, let’s run through our rooftop safety essentials.”\n1. Ladder Angle (30 s)\u000b “First, the ladder. You see the 75° icon—why 75°? Too shallow and it slips out; too steep and it tips backward. To find 75°, stand with your toes at the ladder base, reach your arms straight out: your palms should just touch a rung. Practice that every time you set up.”\n2. Harness & Anchor (45 s)\u000b “Next, fall protection. Every one of you must wear a harness clipped to a certified anchor point. No exceptions. If you’re more than one step onto the roof, hook in before moving. The anchor must be rated for at least 5 kN—always inspect the hardware before use.”\n3. Insulated Gloves & Safety Glasses (30 s)\u000b “Finally, PPE. Even if you’re just tightening a bolt, insulated gloves protect you from unexpected live wires or sharp edges. Safety glasses shield your eyes from dust, flying debris, or cable snap-backs. Keep them on from the moment you step onto the roof.”\nQuick Check (15 s)\u000b “Popcorn style—shout out one rooftop hazard we haven’t covered yet!”\u000b (Wait for a response, e.g., hot surfaces, sun exposure.)\nTransition (10 s)\u000b “Great—keep these rules top of mind all day. Next up, we’ll move into our wind-load and torque block, where we’ll practice safe bolt-torquing on a mock frame.”\n\nFuse & Ground Rules\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFuse on positive DC as close to battery as possible\nUse DC-rated breakers for combiner if > 4 strings\nGrounding and lightning rod ≥ 2 m, copper-clad 16 mm Ø. Target ≤ 5 Ω earth resistance (demo showed 12 Ω acceptable only for class)\nTest resistance ≤ 5 Ω (goal)\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s cover two non-negotiables in every hybrid PV system: DC fusing and earthing.”\n1) Battery-Positive Fuse (45 s):\u000b “Always install the first fuse on the positive DC cable right at the battery’s terminal. Why? If a short happens anywhere in the wiring, that fuse blows instantly and protects every meter of cable, every combiner box, and your inverter. No fuse here means your cable could catch fire or your battery pack could go into thermal runaway.”\n2) DC-Rated Breakers at Combiners (30 s):\u000b “When you have more than four panel strings feeding a combiner, swap the standard fuse for a DC-rated miniature breaker. DC arcs don’t self-extinguish as fast as AC arcs—so you need a breaker designed for DC interruption. Always check the label: it should say ‘DC’ or ‘PV use.’”\n3) Ground Rod Specs (30 s):\u000b “For your earth electrode, drive at least 2 meters of 16 mm-diameter copper-clad steel into the ground, as shown here. Copper-clad offers corrosion resistance, so your rod stays conductive for years.”\n4) Earth Resistance Target (30 s):\u000b “After driving the rod, measure ground-to-rod resistance. In class we saw 12 Ω, which is fine for a demo. But on a real rooftop or field installation, we aim for ≤ 5 Ω. Why? Lightning and surge currents will always seek the path of least resistance—so you want it going into the earth rod, not through your inverter or structure.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s):\u000b “Now that we understand the why and how, let’s head out and test our demo rod to see that 12 Ω reading in action.”\n\nIraqi Grounding Solution\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\n4-Step Chemical Enhancement Process\nPre-Drill & Clean\nDrill hole to 1 m depth, remove loose soil.\nPack Enhancement Compound\nPour in specialized conductive powder (sachet shown).\nBackfill & Hydrate\nRefill with original soil + 2 L of water per 0.5 kg compound.\nMeasure & Verify\nRetest; repeat hydration every 3 months if > 5 Ω.\nGoal: ≤ 5 Ω for safe lightning & fault clearance\nFacilitator notes:\n[After covering fuse & rod specs:]\u000b “In Mosul’s dry, compacted soils, you often see resistivity above 1 000 Ω·m—that’s why a plain copper rod alone can measure 12–15 Ω, not the < 5 Ω we need for reliable fault-clearing.\nStep 1: Pre-Drill & Clean\nWe start by drilling a full 1 m hole. Remove any loose dirt or rock so our compound makes intimate contact with surrounding earth.\u000b\nStep 2: Pack Enhancement Compound\nHere’s our GroundPro™ sachet—a mix of bentonite clay and conductive salts. Pour the entire 0.5 kg pack around the rod.\u000b\nStep 3: Backfill & Hydrate\nRefill the hole with original soil, then pour in 2 L of clean water. The water activates the clay’s swelling and forms a low-resistance zone around the rod.\u000b\nStep 4: Measure & Verify\nAfter waiting 30 minutes for settling, clamp your earth tester and measure. If you’re still above 5 Ω, hydrate again or add a second sachet. We also re-hydrate every 3 – 6 months to maintain performance.\u000b\nMini Q&A (30 s):\u000b “Why do we use both clay and salts instead of just pouring water?”\u000b – Expected answer: “Clay holds moisture; salts improve conductivity.”\n“Exactly—that combo keeps the soil conductive, even in our hottest summers.\nTransition to Demo:\u000b “Next, we’ll drive our demonstration rod, pack a sachet, hydrate, and see how we drop from 12 Ω down to under 5 Ω live. Gloves on—let’s go!”\n\nEarthing Rod Mini-Demo\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nHammer 1 m rod  \nConnect tester – read Ω value on screen\nFacilitator notes:\n“Time for live verification—let’s test our earthing rod.”\n1) Safety First (15 s):\u000b “Before anyone swings, helmet, gloves, and work boots on. Check that no one is standing within the hammer’s arc.”\n2) Hammering the Rod (30 s):\u000b “Trainee, please drive that 1 m rod straight down until only about 10 cm protrudes. Keep it vertical—any tilt reduces contact area with the earth.”\n3) Connecting the Meter (30 s):\u000b “Now, clip one multimeter lead to the top of the rod clamp and the other to our reference stake. Set the meter to the ohms range.”\n4) Reading & Context (30 s):\u000b “We’re seeing 12 Ω. Remember, for a real rooftop you want ≤ 5 Ω—so you’d add water to the soil or drive a second rod nearby to lower the resistance.”\n5) Quick Q&A (15 s):\u000b “Why do you think soil moisture matters? … Exactly: water improves conductivity between the rod and surrounding earth.”\n6) Wrap-up & Transition (15 s):\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen how to measure earth resistance.”\n\nPreview → Workbook Tab 3 & Cleaning-Service ROI\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFacilitator notes:\n“Next, you’ll see exactly how those torque specs and wind-load limits feed into our cost models.

Here’s our Apply block for the next 75 minutes.”\nRotate every 25 minutes on my whistle:\n“Station 1 is your roof-rig build: assemble, torque each M8 bolt exactly to 18 Newton-metres, and then check your rail spacing against the wind-load table we saw this morning.”\n“Station 2 is your dust-loss lab: you’ll ‘dirty’ one panel with sand, record the drop in short-circuit current, then clean it and record again—so you can calculate exactly how much dust cost you in Mosul.”\n“Station 3 is your shading survey: set up the cardboard house and lamp, sweep the shadow across, and use your protractor to find the tilt and azimuth that gives you the highest ISC reading.”\u000b\nDemo the process (30 s):\n“Here’s the torque wrench set to 18 Nm—listen for the click. When you hear it, you’re done. If you over- or under-torque, you fail that bolt check.”\n“For dust, your solar-tester is on ISC mode—press and hold, note the number. Keep all readings on your sticky-note log so you can transfer them to Tab 3 later.”\n“For shading, point your protractor at the panel edge, note the angle, then sweep the lamp until you hit peak current.”\u000b\nSafety & teamwork (30 s):\n“Remember PPE: gloves and glasses on at all times. Don’t climb on the rig—panels stay on the table. Work in pairs: one ‘installer,’ one ‘recorder.’ Swap roles at the halfway whistle.”\n“We’ll keep a whiteboard leaderboard for fastest safe build, biggest % dust-loss, and most precise tilt/azimuth—winners get cookies at break.”\u000b\nLogging (15 s):\n“At the end of each rotation, open your workbook to Tab 3 (‘Roof-Rig Data’) and enter:\u000b • your torque time (how long to torque all bolts),\u000b • dust loss % (dirty vs clean),\u000b • optimal tilt & azimuth (degrees).\n“We’ll reconvene after three rotations and compare results.”\n“Station 1 ready?

Just like yesterday, we’ve organized them into our Learn–Apply–Sell rhythm:\nLEARN — Simulating Solar\n“In this morning’s Learn block, you’ll get hands-on with PVWatts (and PVsyst if it’s available) using the rooftops you photographed. First, we’ll show you how to enter your roof’s tilt, azimuth, and location to generate an annual energy yield and performance ratio. Then we’ll dive into the loss breakdown—so you understand where each kilowatt-hour goes (soiling, thermal losses, mismatch, etc.). By the end, you’ll know exactly how to read those charts and numbers to plan a real installation.”\n\nAPPLY — Laptop & Shade-Scene\n“Next, in Apply, you become your own site-surveyor. You’ll run your rooftop simulation, note the yearly kWh, then switch to the shade-scene tool: draw any trees, chimneys, or water tanks and generate a percentage loss report. This shows in numbers how much shaded hours cost in energy and helps you recommend simple fixes like pruning or panel repositioning.”\n\nSELL — Market, Cash-Flow & Pitch\n“Finally, in Sell, you’ll use our Workbook Tab 5 to build a ten-year cash-flow model—factoring in system cost, O&M, and any supplier financing. Once you see the cumulative savings curve rising, it’s time to craft a short pitch: propose a bundle (e.g. expansion kit plus performance monitoring), highlight trust factors (real warranty, local support), and close with a question: ‘Shall we schedule your upgrade today?’ This wraps up Day 4’s cycle from theory to practice to customer value.”\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) - PVWatts Calculator\n(https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/index.php)\nAssists with:\nIrradiation modeling\nHouse orientation analysis\nSolar energy output estimation\nFacilitator notes:\nPurpose of PVWatts (20 s)\n“PVWatts is a free, web-based tool that lets you estimate a solar array’s annual and monthly energy production in just a few clicks. It handles three key tasks for you:\nIrradiation modeling – it uses NASA satellite data to calculate average sun hours for your location.\nOrientation analysis – you can adjust tilt and azimuth and instantly see how those choices affect yield.\nOutput estimation – it converts panel wattage into expected kWh/day and kWh/year.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nFacilitator notes:\nIntro & Context (15 s): “On this slide you see screen captures from the NREL PVWatts Calculator. We’ll be using PVWatts today to quickly simulate system output before moving into more complex tools.”\nWalk-through the Interface (30 s): “Let’s look at the main sections:\nLocation input: enter Mosul, Iraq here to load local climate data.\nSystem info: set your DC system size (e.g. 3 kW), module type, and array type.\nAdjustments: panel tilt, azimuth, system losses (dirt, wiring).\nResults: scroll down to see the monthly production graph and annual kWh.”\nWhy PVWatts for Day 4 (20 s): “We choose PVWatts because it’s fast, reliable, and gives you a consistent baseline. Today you’ll:\nRun simulations for different panel tilts and sizes.\nCompare your clean-sheet estimates with the real-world data you collected yesterday.\nLearn how small changes—like rotating your array 10° east—can gain or lose hundreds of kWh per year.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s): “Next up, I’ll demo a live PVWatts run: we’ll input our Mosul coordinates, set a 4 kW array with a 30° tilt, and review the output curve. Then, you’ll pair up and simulate your own scenarios.”\nTrainer Tips\n“Encourage participants to note the “Effective Sun Hours” value—it’s the core driver of kWh.\nRemind them that PVWatts assumes “clean” modules; compare against yesterday’s dust-loss data in your lab.\nIf someone’s connection is slow, show them the desktop screenshot you projected.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSystem Sizing & Design Assumptions\nDay 4\nAssumption\nValue\nBaseline system size\n1 kW ⇒ ~1 200 kWh / yr\nPanel tilt\n32–36 °\nAzimuth\n0 ° (true south)\nTemp coefficient\n–0.35 % / °C (≈10 % loss @ 50 °C)\nPerformance ratio target\n≥ 75 %\nIrradiation\n~ 5 kWh / m² / day\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s pause and lock in our ‘standard recipe’ before we design any system.”\nBaseline energy yield (10 s):\n“We assume 1 kW of panels will deliver roughly 1 200 kWh per year in Mosul. That’s our rule of thumb for initial sizing.”\u000b\nOptimal tilt & azimuth (15 s):\n“Tilting panels between 32 and 36 degrees and facing them due south (0 ° azimuth) captures the most sun over the year. Small deviations cost you a few percent of output.”\u000b\nTemperature coefficient (20 s):\n“Every degree above STC reduces power by 0.35 %. At 50 °C on a hot roof, you lose about 10 % of nameplate capacity—so pick panels with a good temp-coef or size up accordingly.”\u000b\nPerformance ratio target (15 s):\n“Our Performance Ratio (PR)—the real-world efficiency after losses—should be 75 % or higher. This accounts for wiring, inverter conversion, soiling, and temperature.”\u000b\nIrradiation (10 s):\n“Mosul averages around 5 kWh/m² per day of sun. Multiply that by your array’s kWp and PR to forecast daily kWh.”\n“With these numbers, you can jump into PVWatts, run your first ‘clean-sheet’ simulation, and then compare to our real-world data from Day 3’s roof-rig.

Let’s go!”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nLaptop & Software Check\nDay 4\nChecklist:\nNavigate to pvwatts.nrel.gov\nSet Location: Mosul, Iraq (use search bar)\nConfirm Inputs:\nSystem size: 1 kW\nTilt: 34 ° (midpoint)\nAzimuth: 0 °\nFallback Plan:\nIf site won’t load, open the offline Excel PVWatts template (link on desktop)\nOr use the printed output screenshots in your folder\nFacilitator notes:\n“Before we dive into our live PVWatts run, let’s make sure every laptop is ready.”\nNavigate (20 s):\n“Please open your browser and go to pvwatts.nrel.gov. You should see the welcome page with a world map.”\u000b\nLocation Setup (20 s):\n“In the ‘Location’ box, type Mosul, Iraq and select it from the list. This ensures our radiation data is correct.”\u000b\nConfirm Inputs (30 s):\n“Check that the System Size is 1 kW, Tilt is around 34 °, and Azimuth is 0 °. We’ll adjust these later, but for now these defaults get us started.”\u000b\nFallback Plan (30 s):\n“If PVWatts is loading slowly or your internet hiccups, don’t panic:\nOpen the ‘PVWatts_Offline.xlsx’ on your desktop (this is an Excel template with the same inputs).\nOr, use the printed screenshots in your folder to follow along.”\u000b\nFinal Check (20 s):\n“Once you see the Mosul map pin and the input form ready, give me a thumbs-up or a quick nod.

Cost-Plus vs Value-Based\u000b “Most sellers quote ‘cost plus 10 % profit.’ That traps you in a race to the bottom: cheap gear, tiny margins, endless price haggling.\u000b Instead, value-based pricing charges according to the customer’s financial gain—their reduced diesel bills, avoided downtime, and warranty peace of mind.”\n2. Why Solar Fits Value-Based\u000b “A hybrid system isn’t just hardware; it’s a money-machine. You save IQD X per month—that X is your true price anchor. When you lead with ROI, customers stop arguing over IQD 50 000 here or there.”\n3. Introducing the Trust Pyramid\u000b “But numbers alone aren’t enough. Trust is your ladder to premium price points.\u000b • Product Quality: Start by showing them real panels and inverters you’ve vetted—Level 1.\u000b • Reliability: Then highlight safety measures—DC fuses, proper torque specs, dust-proof frames—Level 2.\u000b • ROI Guarantee: Offer a simple promise: ‘Your system pays for itself in Y years or I’ll discount service fees.’ That moves you to Level 3.\u000b • Partnership: Finally, seal the deal by positioning yourself as their ongoing service partner—monitoring, maintenance, future add-ons—Level 4.”\n4. Bundle Anchor\u000b “When you propose your expansion or cleaning plans, bundle them under this pyramid:\u000b ‘You get German-grade panels we guarantee for 25 years, we install with DC-rated fuses and 18 Nm torque checks, we promise a 3-year payback, and we’ll handle all your maintenance for 12 months.’\u000b That’s a value-packed offer, not just ‘cost + X.’”\nTransition to Next\u000b “With pricing & trust frameworks in hand, let’s pick two premium services to bundle into your Day 4 expansion pitch.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nBundle Brainstorm: Pick 2 Premium Add-Ons\nDay 4\nOption\nWhy It Adds Value\nTilt-Angle Audit\nOptimizes yearly yield by 3–5 %\nTorque Recheck Visit\nEnsures safety & warranty compliance\nWhatsApp Performance Alerts\nReal-time fault detection & remote support\nSeasonal Dust Cleaning\nMaintains ≥ 95 % output & extends panel life\nBattery Health Scan\nEarly fault warning → fewer replacements\nGrid-Export Monitoring\nShows extra revenue via feed-in tariffs\nIn your team, choose any two that best fit Ahmed’s expansion plan.

She runs a small textile workshop here in Mosul, roofed with corrugated metal, sewing machines humming all day.”\u000b\nWalk Through the Table (45 s):\nFact: “She powers ten sewing machines plus her lights, which peaks at around 30 amps. That’s why our amps→kWh formula is front and center.”\nRoof: “Her roof is 10 by 8 meters—enough space for panels, but temperatures up to 50 °C and heavy dust are real challenges.”\nDiesel Cost: “Currently she pays 1.27 million IQD per month on diesel. That’s fuel for 15 amps, seven days a week—that figure is unsustainable.”\nWish: “Her dream? ‘Silent, clean power—no more noisy generators or diesel smell.’\nPay-back: “She wants solar to pay for itself within three years so she can reinvest in her business.”\u000b\nTie to Today’s Sprint (30 s):\u000b “In just a few minutes, you’ll sketch Zahra’s hybrid system: panel wattage, battery capacity, inverter size, and cable/fuse specs. Then jump into your ROI sheet to see if you can hit her ≤ 3-year target.”\u000b\nEngagement Prompt (10 s):\u000b “Any quick clarifying questions about Zahra’s numbers? If not, let’s sharpen pencils—5-minute design sprint is next!”\n\nLocal Tariffs & Rates\nGrid Tariff: 500 IQD/kWh\nGenerator Tariff: 200 000 IQD per amp-month\nBattery Efficiency: ~90 % round-trip\nSafety Buffer: +20 % on all estimates\nSprint Cheat-Sheet: Amps → kWh → IQD\nDay 5\nKey Formulas\nEnergy (kWh) = (Amps × Volts × Hours) ÷ 1000\nCost (IQD) = kWh × Tariff (IQD/kWh)\nPay-back (years) = System Cost (IQD) ÷ Annual Savings (IQD)\nPsst: For Amps→kWh, always use 220 V unless otherwise noted.\nFacilitator notes:\n“Alright teams, before you race into the 5-minute sprint, here’s your on-the-fly cheat-sheet.”\nEnergy Calculation (20 s):\u000b “First, convert your measured current into energy:\u000b `kWh = (Amps × Volts × Hours) ÷ 1000`.\u000b For example, 30 A at 220 V for 8 hours gives:\u000b `(30 × 220 × 8) ÷ 1000 = 52.8 kWh`.”\u000b\nCost Computation (15 s):\u000b “Next, multiply that kWh by the tariff. Grid power costs 500 IQD/kWh, so 52.8 kWh × 500 IQD = 26 400 IQD per day. For generator-only customers, use the generator tariff: 200 000 IQD per amp-month, or break it down per day if needed.”\u000b\nPay-Back Estimate (15 s):\u000b “To see how fast solar pays off, divide your total system cost by the annual savings. If you save 800 000 IQD per year and your system cost is 2 400 000 IQD, pay-back = 2.4 M ÷ 0.8 M = 3 years.”\u000b\nTariff Reminders (10 s):\u000b “Remember, our grid rate is 500 IQD, but if you’re comparing to diesel you must translate amps into a monthly bill. And always add a 20 % buffer to cover losses or unexpected loads.”\n“Keep this slide on screen. Ready, set… sprint in 3, 2, 1… GO!”\n\nPortfolio Excellence: Before → After\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 5\n*Case Study B\n\nBefore: Installation with undersized wires and no fusing\nAfter: Rewired system showing 6 mm² DC cabling, labeled DC fuses at combiner, and latching connectors\nCaption: “From unsafe cabling → full DC-rated protection and correct wire sizing”\n*Case Study A\n\nBefore: Grainy photo of a dusty, mis-wired rooftop array\nAfter: Crisp shot of the same roof with neat panel alignment, correctly torqued bolts, clear cable runs, and clean modules\nCaption: “From unkempt and under-torqued → standardized torque, neat cables, 95 % peak output”\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s celebrate real examples of excellence—where the right design choices turned a so-so install into a client’s dream setup.”\nIntroduce the Slide (10 s):\u000b “Here are two snapshots from our recent projects: dusty, disorganized arrays turned into high-performance, professional systems.”\u000b\nWalk Through Case Study A (20 s):\u000b “On the left you see the ‘Before’—panels misaligned, dusty, loose bolts, and tangled cables cutting into performance. On the right, the ‘After’: every panel is clean and correctly pitched, all M8 bolts torqued to 18 Nm, cables neatly clipped and labeled. That simple rework boosted output by 10 % and dropped maintenance calls almost overnight.”\u000b\nWalk Through Case Study B (20 s):\u000b “In Case B, the install used undersized 4 mm² cable without any DC fuses—that’s a fire hazard and guaranteed voltage drop. We rewired it with 6 mm² conductors, installed DC-rated fuses at the combiner box, and used proper latching MC4 connectors. The result? Zero faults in six months and a happy customer who refers us repeatedly.”\u000b\nKey Takeaway (10 s):\u000b “These ‘Before → After’ stories prove that attention to torque, wiring standards, and protective devices not only keeps people safe but also makes you the go-to pro in Mosul’s booming solar market.”\n“Keep these examples in mind as you prepare your final presentations—your portfolio is your strongest sales tool.”\n\nAssessment Rubric\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 5\nCriterion\nExcellent (3)\nSatisfactory (2)\nNeeds Improvement (1)\nTechnical Accuracy\nAll measurements & calculations are correct.\nMinor errors in one calculation.\nMultiple errors or missing data.\nSafety & Standards\nPerfect lock-out, PPE, wiring practices.\nOne minor protocol lapse.\nSeveral safety lapses.\nPresentation & Pitch\nClear, confident, 60-s pitch with strong hook & ask.\nPitch covers basics but lacks flair.\nUnclear message or too long.\nProfessionalism\nPolished portfolio, neat slides, on time.\nMinor formatting issues.\nDisorganized or late.\nFacilitator notes:\n“This rubric will guide today’s final assessment. Let’s walk through each criterion so you know exactly how you’ll be evaluated.”\nIntroduce the Rubric (15 s):\u000b “On this slide, you see four criteria we’ll use to score your final portfolio and pitch: Technical Accuracy, Safety & Standards, Presentation & Pitch, and Professionalism.”\u000b\nTechnical Accuracy (20 s):\u000b “We’ll check your field measurements and worksheet outputs. A perfect score means every kWh, torque, and ROI calculation is spot on. One small mistake drops you to ‘Satisfactory’, and multiple errors to ‘Needs Improvement’.”\u000b\nSafety & Standards (20 s):\u000b “This covers your lock-out/tag-out ritual, PPE use, correct fuse placement, cable sizing, and wiring neatness. Zero protocol lapses earns ‘Excellent’; one minor slip is ‘Satisfactory’; repeated lapses are a concern.”\u000b\nPresentation & Pitch (20 s):\u000b “Your 60-second pitch must open with a strong hook, present clear data, state a concise pay-back, and close with an ask. A polished delivery is ‘Excellent’, a basic delivery ‘Satisfactory’, and a rambling or unclear pitch ‘Needs Improvement’.”\u000b\nProfessionalism (15 s):\u000b “This is your portfolio slide deck and its timeliness. Neat formatting, correct labels, and punctual submission get top marks. Minor formatting issues are okay, but disorganized or late work will affect your score.”\u000b\nWrap & Next Steps (10 s):\u000b “Keep this rubric visible as you finalize your presentations.
