How are you doing today? \nToday, we are going to continue to work on your Profit and Loss statement. We will focus on your costs and think through all of the expenses your business will face over time. As we did with the revenue model, we will use the finance worksheet as a way to play around with our costs and see where we can afford have higher costs, and see where we will actually need to cut our costs.\n1\n\nBreak down the different types of business costs. \nForecast ongoing business costs.\nBuild out the next step of your P&L statement.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nBreak down the types of costs shown in a profit and loss statement.\nUnderstand all the elements that contribute to your ongoing business costs.\nBuild out the next step of your P&L statement.\n\n2\n\n*https://strategyzer.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/topics/113454-using-our-tools-canvases-methods\nREVENUE STREAMS\nCOST STRUCTURE\nCUSTOMER SEGMENT\nCHANNELS\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nVALUE PROPOSITION\nKEY RESOURCES\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nKEY PARTNERS\nYOUR BUSINESS MODEL\n4 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nReview our location on the BMC\nWe are always coming back here to the BMC.  Last week we took a look at your revenue streams to try and forecast revenues for the next three years, and today we will look at the other side, which are your costs. You can’t run a business without incurring some expenses along the way. You usually need to pay to create and deliver value to your customer segments. We will spend this session breaking down the different types of costs and forecasting those like we did for your revenues. \n\nAsk: Why is it important to have a clear picture of your costs before you start your business?\nPotential answers could be:\nEven if you are making sales and your situation is good, if you can’t control your costs, your profitability or cash flow could be ruined. \nIt is necessary for planning. If you want to hit a certain number of sales, you should think about what you need to do to actually make those sales (and what you need to spend). \nBy laying out your costs, you can think more strategically about new systems or techniques to lower them (maybe through partnerships or new and innovative systems)\n\nProfit and loss\n  Revenue model\n  Cost model\n\nBalance sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nRecap: Last we worked on the revenue model. This week we will work on developing your cost model. After these 2 parts are finished, you will have finished your Profit and Loss statement. Remember, that just because we finished the session and you do the assignment, that doesn’t mean we won’t see this again. As you develop your business strategy and clarify your product and go to market strategy, run numbers on here. You want to keep this updated as you progress with your business. Right now there are a lot of estimations, but as you clarify your business model, these financials will become more and more accurate.\n\nTYPES OF COSTS\n5-10 minutes: Discussion + lecture\nAsk: From what you understand, what are the different types of costs? Can someone give me a few examples \nWrite all answers on the whiteboard or Jamboard. \nGroup answers so that you get categories for COGS, salaries, and SG&A (you can have other groups if necessary). \nPotential Answer\nEntrepreneurs will give a variety of answers, write them all down.\nGroup their answers to highlight the costs below:\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS): Direct costs of producing an item sold by a company (e.g., materials, direct labor).\nSalaries: Team and staff payments (if directly tied to production, might be COGS).\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A): Indirect costs like rent, marketing, and overhead.\nNew Strategic Layer:\nCosts reflect values: Do you prioritize efficiency, quality, or resilience?\nCosts carry risks: Consider price volatility (e.g., energy costs).\nEfficiencies save money over time: Smart investments (e.g., longer-lasting materials, reducing waste, energy-efficient choices) can lower costs long-term.\nStrategic investment in cost management: Businesses that invest in durability or tech upgrades may face higher upfront costs but reduce recurring expenses over time.\nExample: Switching to LED lights may have an upfront cost but reduces long-term electricity expenses.\nActivity Prompt (Discussion 5-10 min):\nWhat costs matter most to your business?\nHow could aligning with values—such as efficiency—help manage risks and costs?\nExample: If your priority is operational efficiency, would bulk ordering, material choices, or equipment upgrades help lower costs over time?\nGroup responses into COGS, Salaries, SG&A as before.\n1 minute: Transition\nToday, we will talk in more detail about COGS, Salaries, and SG&A.  These are these are key categories in your profit and loss statement.\nNext week we will go deeper in your start up costs, including capital expenditure vs. operating expenditure..\n\n5\n\nCOGS\n40 minutes: Lecture, brainstorm, demonstration (this includes hidden slides 7-11)\n\nThe first thing we will go over are the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Again COGS are the direct costs of producing an item sold by a company. This includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the product itself. \nSo for example, if you sell T-shirts, you need to calculate the cost of actually producing that item. Whether you are buying it from someone else, or producing it from scratch, these costs have to be accounted for.\n\n\n30 minutes: Brainstorm \nWe will do two examples together on the board (a very simple example and a complex one).\nThe entrepreneurs should lead the conversation and figure out how to calculate the unit economics of the examples (the price of one scoop of ice cream for example) \nThe hidden slides 7-10 are for trainers to go deeper on how to facilitate the discussion for each part of the COGS calculation (keep in mind that the slides are animated so might have a few layers of information).\n\n5 minutes: Example 1 (simple)\nHow do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business? – slide 7\nGive background info on business:\nYou know a tub of ice cream costs you $9 to buy from your supplier\nIt also costs you $1 per container to put your own label on the tub ice cream (this is agreed to with the supplier). \nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell\nAsk: What if you don’t sell ice cream by the tub, you sell it by the scoop?\nAnswer: We need to figure out how many scoops are in 1 tub of ice cream, then divide. \nLet’s say there are 100 scoops of ice cream in a tub\n$10/100 scoops = $1 per scoop\n\n5 minutes Example 2 (advanced): \nThat was easy right? What if you don’t know the price of a tub of ice cream? – Slides 7-11\nAsk: What would you do to calculate the cost of 1 scoop?\nGo through a detailed example of calculating the costs of something from scratch. In hidden slides 7-11 we go through how to calculate the price of 1 scoop of ice cream. The general layout is as follows:\nIdentify what goes into making the item (identify all the supplies/ingredients) –Slide 8\nIdentify the price of everything you buy (that goes into what you are making) – Slide 8\nFigure out how much of each ingredient you use (what you buy vs what you use) – Slides 8 & 9 \nLink unit cost to sales – Slide 10 & 11\n\n10-15 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \n6\n\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nItem\nNormal cost \nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\nDay Tour\n$90.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\nItem\nNormal cost \nBulk order price\nBulk order requirement\nDelivery fee (charged on business)\nMore Cost-Efficient Option (If Applicable)\nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\n$5.00\n30\n$2.00\n$4.50 (Eco-friendly fabric in bulk)\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n$0.00\nDay Tour\n$90.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n$0.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n$0.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n$0.00\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + demonstration\n\nCalculating COGS can be simple or highly complex depending on the product.\nA basic approach: Make a simple chart to highlight how much each unit costs your business.\n\nSimple examples:\nExample: How do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business?\nGive background info on business:\nYou know a tub of ice cream costs you $9 to buy from your supplier (Old, will remove)\nIt also costs you $1 per container to put your own label on the tub ice cream (this is agreed to with the supplier). (Old, will remove)\nA tub of ice cream costs $9 from your supplier.\nLabeling adds $1 per tub.\nTotal COGS per tub: $10.\nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS? (Old, will remove) How could you reduce costs while maintaining quality?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell (Old, will remove) Bulk purchasing could lower the price per tub to $8, reducing long-term costs.\n\nAnother example: A t-shirt costs you $5 +$2 delivery cost. You would put the sale type as a T-shirt and the unit cost is $7. (Old, will remove) T-shirt costs $5 + $2 delivery fee = Total COGS: $7 per shirt\nAsk: How could efficiency improve costs?\nAnswer: A bulk order (30+ shirts) might reduce unit cost to $5 while lowering delivery per unit.\n\nActivity (30 min):\nStep 1: Calculate COGS for your business.\nStep 2: Identify one strategic tweak (e.g., bulk purchase, green sourcing, supplier negotiation) that could lower costs long-term.\nDiscussion: Where in your production costs can you improve efficiency? Would bulk purchasing, different suppliers, or alternative materials reduce costs?\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration \nGo onto the financial model and show the simple COGS calculation chart. (Old, will remove)\nPoint out areas that can add to your COGS such as delivery, bulk orders, maybe you can add something like product customization, etc…  (Old, will remove)\nShow the COGS calculation in the financial model.\nHighlight areas where businesses can reduce costs smartly—e.g., bulk orders, sustainable alternatives, packaging changes.\n\nIf you are not calculating any COGS, feel free to remove these rows altogether.\n\n\n7\n\n We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream.\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurement used when making the product)\nPrice\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n(10-15 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nLet’s take the example of an ice cream shop.\nAsk: We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream. There are several ways to do this, so lets think about how we want to approach this.\nHave a discussion on the board to see if the class can figure out how to determine how much a tub of ice cream costs, or even one ice cream cone. Guide the entrepreneurs to calculate this on the whiteboard before showing them the answer.\nManage the flow of the discussion to cover the following points:\nTo make it easier, first let’s see how much it would cost us to make a tub of ice cream. You would never make 1 scoop of ice cream, you make a large amount and then sell the scoops individually. So lets say that in our tub of ice cream, there are 100 scoops.\nFirst figure out the ingredients you need to make this tub of ice cream. Write down all of the ingredients you would need to make ice cream on the white board (it is ok to estimate). \nPotential answers could be:\nSugar\nMilk\nSalt\nOreos\nEtc….\nWhen you buy this ingredient, how much do your buy (1 kilo, 1 package, 100 pieces, etc…). Write that down next to the ingredient itself.\nHow much did you pay for the ingredients? Write that down as well so you can calculate how much you actually spend\nTransition to next slide: Great, the first steps are done, now what do we do? \n\nNote to trainer: We are not ice cream experts, so we are going to stay simple for now. If this was really a business we are working on, we would need to calculate the real costs and know the real ingredients. This is just a simple example so we are making some things up.\nIt is ok, if the group comes up with a different answer from the example shown. \n\n8\n\nBut I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! \nI won’t have accurate costs estimates!\n  COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurment used when making the product)\nPrice\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\n800\n$2.56\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\n5\n$4.00\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\n10\n$1.25\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\n5\n$1.56\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\n20\n$3.00\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\n0.5\n$0.30\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\n$     -\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n100\n$12.00\n(5-10 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6 \n\nSome entrepreneurs might point out “But I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! I won’t have accurate cost estimates!”. Make sure to explain how to accurately calculate COGS considering the fact that they won’t use all of their ingredients.\nMake sure when you write out the quantity you are buying, you convert it to the measurements that you will use when making the ice cream. For example, you buy 1 Kilo of sugar, but you cook with cups, so write it out as 5 cups as well (as you can see in the image). \nThe next step is to write down how much of the ingredient you use to make a tub of ice cream. From all that information, you can find the amount you spend on just the ingredients you use. This means you can use the rest of your ingredients and not miscount your costs.\nIf each tub has about 100 scoops, you can divide the tub price by 100 to get the cost per scoop.\nNow you know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream!\n\nTransition: \nAsk: What do you guys think is the next step? Now that we know how much 1 scoop of ice cream, what do we use that information for?\nWe need to see how much we are spending month to month to produce the ice-cream that we are selling\nMultiply price per scoop by the number of ice cream sales. \nThis is what is known as a variable cost. \n\n\n9\n\n# of ice cream scoops produced\nCALCULATING VARIABLE COSTS\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY \nFEBRUARY\nBranded T-Shirt\n20\nIce cream scoop\n300\n315\nSweet drink\n300\n315\n(10 minutes: Discussion) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nAsk: What do you guys know about variable costs? Have the class share what they know on the topic.\nPotential answers: \nThere are fixed costs and variable costs. \nFixed costs stay the same month to month. Variable costs change.\nIf you produce more, it costs you more. \n\nAsk: If it costs us $.25 for one scoop of ice cream, and we sell 300 scoops in January, how much are the Ice cream related COGS in January?\nAnswer: $74\nAs we increase our ice cream sales, we also increase the COGS related to ice cream.\nIn the financial model, you should link your sales with COGS to calculate your variable costs.\n\n\nAsk: What other things can be variable in your business?\nPotential answers: \nDelivery of your item (each item sold needs to be delivered- you can link this to sales as in COGS calculation)\nDirect labor for your product/service (if not paid a salary)\nIf you offer something (like a gift) with every purchase\nTransportation\nAdvertising\nEtc…\n\nQuestion that might come up: \nHow do we forecast variable costs that aren’t linked to sales?\nWe will approach variable costs in 2 ways. \nWe will link costs to sales. As sales grow, some of your variable costs grow with them\nFor the items that are variable that we can’t link to sales and easily forecast. We are going to estimate how much we would want to spend on those items. For example, although advertising can be variable (you can spend as much as you want on it), we are going to treat it like a fixed cost and set a budget for ourselves and not spend over that amount. \n\n10\n\nCALCULATING COGS\nTOTAL COGS\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nIce Cream Costs\n74\n78\n82\n86\nT-Shirt Costs\n-\n240\n-\n240\nSweet Drink Costs\n834\n876\n919\n965\nTotal COGS\n$74\n$318\n$82\n$326\n(3 minutes: Lecture + demonstration) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nCalculating the actual costs shown on P&L:\nNow based on the unit price of an item, and the amount old, you can easily calculate the actual COGS. \nThis is broken down month to month and can also be broken down product to product.\nThe more detailed you are in your work, the more detailed and accurate the results will be.\nThe COGS will generate automatically into your P&L if you don’t add or remove rows. \nIf you add/remove rows, make sure to look at the formulas to ensure they add up correctly.\nThe trainer can show exactly how this works by doing it on the actual Google sheet.\n11\n\nGross Profit = Revenues - COGS\nGROSS PROFIT\n2018A\n2019A\n2020A\n2021E\n2022E\nREVENUES\nSales\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 120,000\n$ 200,000\nServices\n$ 20,000\n$ 40,000\nOther Income\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 140,000\n$ 240,000\nCOGS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,400\n$ 8,820\n$ 9,261\n$ 9,724\nGROSS PROFIT\n$ 19,000\n$ 36,000\n$ 71,180\n$ 130,739\n$ 230,276\nEXPENSES\nSG&A\n$ 12,000\n$ 12,600\n$ 13,230\n$ 13,892\n$ 14,586\nSalaries\n$ 15,000\n$ 15,750\n$ 16,538\n$ 17,364\n$ 18,233\nOther expenses\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL EXPENSES\n$ 35,000\n$ 36,750\n$ 38,588\n$ 40,517\n$ 42,543\nPROFIT/LOSS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,250\n$ 41,413\n$ 99,483\n$ 197,457\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nTo place us back onto the P&L, let’s see where we are and what we have done so far.\nGo through the P&L statement up until Gross profit\nWe have talked about our revenues. Here we can see how our different revenue streams are highlighted. \nNext, we want to calculate our COGS. We have just learned how to do that.\nNext, we have gross profit. Gross profit is the money that a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products, or the costs associated with providing its services. This means your total revenues – COGS.\nQuiz the group and ask something like:\nIf you made $1,000 selling hats and your hats cost you $200 to make and deliver to your customer, what is your gross profit? \nAnswer: $800\n\nAsk: How many of you need to calculate COGS in one way or another?\nSome people might raise their hands, others might not. \nCOGS won’t be relevant for everyone. In reality, your COGS are only one type of expense. In the next slides, we are going to take a look at how to calculate the other parts (which will be relevant for everyone). \n\nRecap: You need to calculate the COGS for your business (if relevant) in order to get an accurate picture of your expenses, you should understand the unit economics of your business. This is how much it costs you to produce 1 unit of whatever it is that you are selling. \n\n\n\n\n12\n\nSALARIES\n10-15 minutes: Brainstorm + discussion\n\n3 minutes: Lecture\nAs you mentioned previously, another cost that we need to consider are staff salaries. Your team is an essential part of your business, but they can often be costly. You need to evaluate who should be on your team, when to hire them, and how much you need to pay them! These are strategic questions because you usually need staff to create and sell your product, but you don’t want to hire unnecessary people. You can use the finance tool to help plan when the best time to hire employees are. \n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\nWe will do an example together on the board and then I will show you how to apply it on your cost assumptions tab of the financial model.\nThe brainstorm/explanation should be done on a whiteboard or Jamboard. \n\nExample:  Calculating salaries\nAsk: What is the best way to approach figuring out our costs related to salaries?\nStep 1: Figure out who you need to hire\nSome things are obvious. You already know who to hire\nLook at your sales forecast. Who do you need to actually reach that target? Don’t hire someone until you need them\nFind interns and students who could volunteer instead of hiring someone\nTake more responsibilities on yourself\nNote to trainer: We will go over hiring in more detail in the LEAD sessions\nStep 2: Estimate their salary\n\nStep 3: Figure out when you want to hire and how many people\n\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \nPoints to bring up include:\nAs entrepreneurs are answering that question, show them these parts of the model:\nBlue: The job title of the person you need. \nOrange: The salaries for each person. Make sure you write your own salary as well. Put a number that you actually deserve (what is your worth?)!\nMonth to month in orange: The number of that particular employee you will hire for that given month (for example, 1 CEO, 2 interns, etc…). If your salary is too high, remember you don’t have to pay yourself at the beginning or you can take half of your salary (type in .5 in the month to month box – shown in the first row of the second picture under October and November). \n\n\n\n13\n\nPRACTICE\n\nAdd your employees into your financial model!\n15 minutes: Activity\n\n2 minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work on their own model and input information for their salaries. \nWe will not apply the COGS directly because it does not relate to everyone, but this is a good time for them to apply some of the new knowledge onto their business.\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nSet the timer for 8-10 minutes and let entrepreneurs work on their model.\nThe trainer should go around to answer any questions or help when needed. \nTrainers should make sure to point out if they want to hire someone who might not be necessary at this point. You can suggest to hire them maybe in year 2 or 3 (show them on the model how that would work)\n\n\n\nSELLING, \u000bGENERAL, & ADMINISTRATIVE\n15 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nHave a brief discussion on selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&A). These are costs that are not directly related to production or salaries but are essential for business operations.\nOk, so we are clear on COGS and salaries, now what about all of your other costs? Where do they go? \nWe will put all of your other costs (except for startup costs) under SG&A.\nThe SG&A category can encompass all of your other expenses that we haven’t accounted for yet. \nAsk: What are the other expenses that are left that we still need to account for?\nPotential answers can be:\nRent\nOverhead (ongoing expenses of operating your business)\nAdvertising\nSupplies\nLawyer fees\nAccountant\nUtilities\nWorkspace efficiency\nEquipment upgrades\nOperational tools to reduce costs over time.\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDemonstrate how the finance tool works:\nCategories: You have already mentioned a few of the categories that can be listed in here. These can be larger categories broken down into specific expenses. For example, you can see that I have advertising listed here. Instead of just saying $160 will be spent on advertising, you want to think about how you will actually advertise. Think about where your customers are and how you can best reach them. In this case I chose Facebook promotions, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and printed materials. You should think of every expense you will need to pay out over the coming years and write it out. \nMonth to month expenses: You can highlight how much you plan on spending every month for each category. Take a look at your sales targets per month and consider how much you would have to spend to get there. Be as realistic as possible. \nFor example, If you spend $100 on a Facebook advertisement, how many views will that generate? How many people typically look at an ad before converting into a sale? If you are only spending a small amount of money on 1 form of advertising, don’t expect a ton of sales! \nYoY growth: The year over year (YoY) growth box allows you to set a standard growth rate for your expenses. You should assume that you will be spending more on expenses every year because of the rise in prices or because you are spending more as you grow. You can choose to use this method or not depending on the situation of that expense item. \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nAre these fixed or variable costs?\nSome of them are fixed and some of them are variable. Things like rent are fixed all the time. Maybe there is a price increase, but for the most part you know that it will be the same month to month.\nFor some of the others such as advertising, meeting expenses, and so on, these are variable, but if you plan ahead and budget for them, you can treat them as a fixed cost. You can say that you will only spend $100 on _____ per month or something like that. Remember that we want to plan as accurately as possible. \n\n.\n15\n\nPROFIT AND LOSS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nYEAR 3\nSALES\nProducts\n26,276\n72,604\n127,752\nSubscriptions\n6,364\n11,428\n20,523\nTOTAL SALES:\n$ 46,965\n$ 84,032\n$ 148,276\nEXPENSES\nCOGS\n17,333\n29,635\n49,097\nSalaries\n19,700\n49,000\n92,400\nSG&A\n8,820\n12,945\n13,166\nTOTAL EXPENSES:\n$45,853\n$91,580\n$154,663\nNET INCOME:\n$2,622\n$7,548\n$6,387\n5 minutes: Demonstration + discussion\n\nStay on the financial model and show the profit and loss summary tab.\nFinally, now that all the costs are accounted for, you can see the completed P&L.\nShow how it is all linked to that one page. \nIf you look at the P&L summary tab, you can see all your information at a very high level. Again, these numbers should automatically generate for you based on the totals generated from your detailed P&L statement (which are generated from your assumptions). Just make sure that all of the calculations and formulas add up in the detailed profit and loss tab.\n\nAsk: What can you learn from this tab? How can you use the information here to be a better manager?\nPotential answers:\nThis tab can be very insightful for you or anyone else evaluating your financials. \nGet a very clear summary of all the details of where you are doing well and where you are suffering. \nYou can see if your costs/revenues are super high or low. \nFor example, salaries are posing a big problem here. They are so expensive and are growing fast!\nYou can easily see if there is an error somewhere on your financials on this page, you know where to go to solve it or fix the formula\nYou can see your growth and profitability over time. Are you being realistic? Are you over or undervaluing yourself? \nWhen you start to really track information, this can be helpful to help you know where to cut costs or be more efficient. \nIf these numbers are interesting enough, an investor might ask how you plan on doing it, which could lead to a longer conversation with them\nAlternatively, an investor might look at them and be turned off right away.\n\n\n16\n\nPRACTICE\n\nHow can you make this business more profitable?\n45 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nBreak the room into small groups of 3-5 people\nAllow entrepreneurs to go somewhere comfortable to work as a group\nEvery group will get an example P&L statement to work on as a group (Old, will remove)\nThe P&L statement will not be profitable (Old, will remove)\nEvery group will receive an example Profit & Loss (P&L) statement that is not profitable.\nEach group needs to evaluate the statement and make it profitable.

How are you doing today? \nToday, we will go into our 3rd and final financial modelling session! We will focus on your balance sheet and your start up costs. \nWe will work on your financials together the whole time. Please stop me if you have any questions or more explanation because other people are probably having the same questions.\n\n1\n\nInclude your start-up budget into your financials.\nGet to know the balance sheet and begin making one. \nUnderstand how financials change with investment or loans.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nInclude your start-up budget into your financials.\nGet to know the balance sheet and begin making one.\nUnderstand how financials change with investment or loans.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nProfit and Loss\n  Revenue Model\n  Cost Model\n\nBalance Sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s Equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo where are we?\nAs you know, during the incubator, we will work on your financial model. This means that you will come out with a forecasted statement of profit and loss and also a balance sheet. We have already started and completed our statement of profit and loss!\nAsk: Can someone give me a brief overview of what it is (profit and loss)? \nPotential answers:\nRecording all the money coming in and going out (revenues- costs)\nCosts include COGS, SG&A, Salaries, etc…\nThey did it over a timespan of 3 years, but they can make it longer if they want.\nEtc…\n\nGreat, now we will work on your balance sheet! This highlights all the things that you have (assets) vs all of the things that you owe (liabilities). This will be forecasted over 3 years as well. \n\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nSalaries\nSelling, General, and Administrative (SG&A)\nStart Up Costs\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX)\nCapital Expenditure (CAP-EX)\nTYPES OF COSTS:\n2 minutes: Transition\n\nThe first step we will take to create your balance sheet is to outline what we have. Because most of us aren’t operating yet, we don’t have anything! Therefore, we are going to take the “what we have” part from our startup budget. We are going to create our balance sheet from the perspective that we get the investment that we need to launch. This means that “what you have” is based off of your startup costs (what they are \"going\" to receive).\nWe have already covered COGS, salaries, and SG&A. The last type of cost we will cover are the startup costs. We will also look at your startup costs and see if they are an operating expense or capital expenditure. We will go into detail of what these things mean later.\n\n4\n\nSTART UP BUDGET\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: We have already talked about how to make a startup budget during Ignite, but can someone just give us a brief recap of what it consists of? \nPotential answers (no need to talk about them all because this was covered already, but make sure they have a good understanding of what to include):\nBusinesses spend money before they open their doors. Start up expenses are those expenses incurred before your business is running, but contribute to the long term success of it.\nYou can include what you are planning to contribute into the business as well through your personal contribution.\nThe different things that you need to include in your start up budget can include:\nDevelopment costs: What you need to actually create and develop your product. This will really depend on what you are making. I listed some examples below, but it can be much more detailed than this.\nApp development\nWebsite development\nDomain and Hosting for 1 year\nInitial research and development\nLogo designer \nOffice, store, center, land rent for 6 months to a year (depending on how long you think it will take before you are profitable) \nFurniture/decoration\nConstruction/repairs/paint\nWebsite\nLogo design\nMachinery or tools\nInitial marketing:\nGrand opening event\nSocial media advertisements (when doing the budget, be specific on which platforms you will use and how much you will spend on each)\nFlyers, brochures, marketing material\nSignage \nInitial working capital: Any additional money you will needed to operate your business for the first 6 months to a year while you are still working to become profitable\nSalaries for the first few months\nOperational needs\nLegal fees:\nRegistration\nLawyer fees\nName registration\nIntellectual property and patents\nMaterials and supplies: \nThe first set of items that you need to sell\nMaterials needed to make the final product\nCleaning supplies\nPaper goods\nConsumables\n5\n\nSTART UP COSTS\nStart Up Costs\nAmount\nNotes\nRent\n$2,000\n4 months\nMarketing and Advertising\n$1,920\nMarketing materials, SEO, social media advertising\nApp Development\n$15,000\nNative android and IOS\nSignage\n$1,500\nOutdoor signage and decoration\nWebsite\n$2,500\nWebsite development\nCompany stamp\n$900\nLegal and Licensing\n$4,000\nLawyer to help register and provide legal services during the first year\nBank account\n$50\nBank fees\nOffice Supplies\n$200\nStaplers, hole punch, binders\nFile Cabinets\n$200\nDesk and Chairs\n$500\nReception and office desks\nComputer\n$1,500\nMac computer\nConsumales\n$500\nPaper, pens, ink catridges, other supplies\nTOTAL START-UP COSTS NEEDED:\n$30,770\nYOUR STARTUP BUDGET\nYEAR 1\nPERSONAL CONTRIBUTION\nPersonal Investment\nAmount\nNotes\nSalary\n$30,000\n$2,500/month for 1 year\nComputer\n$1,000\nTwo 3 year old Lenovo laptops\nFurniture\n$1,000\nLightly used office furniture\nPrinter\n$329\nHP Color Laserjet Pro\nPrinter Ink\n$500\n10 cartridges of ink\nTOTAL\n$32,829\n15 minutes: Demonstration + activity\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDuring Ignite, we made a simple budget based on what you thought about your business at the time. A lot of this was made simply using assumptions. Now that you are much farther along on your business, I would like you to re-evaluate your budget and make one that reflects the new knowledge you have about your business. If you are still unsure of what you need to start your business, you need to do more research to really understand what this number would look like. \nGo onto the excel sheet and show the entrepreneurs exactly how to use the Startup Costs tab of the excel sheet.\nMake sure to explain the personal contribution! I pulled this out to show everything that the entrepreneur has invested in their own business. They should make sure to show any assets they are contributing because this will show up on their balance sheet. \nAsk: Why do you think that marketing and advertising white?\nLet them share their ideas\nAnswer: That square is white because it is a formula. If you look at where that number came from, it is from your assumptions page on the P&L. It is from the SG&A advertising total from year 1.  If you intend to have someone pay for all or part of your advertising, you need to make sure that this number matches your actual plan.\n\n5 minutes: Activity\nAsk everyone to take out their start up budget. \nTake the next 5 minutes to adjust your startup budget and put it into your financial model. \nJust focus on the columns called “Start-up Costs”, “Amount”, and “Notes”. Ignore the rest for now!\nThink about all of your costs necessary to start your business. \nNote down where you need to gather more information\nDon’t forget to add your personal contribution!\n\n\n\n\n\nCAP-EX OR OP-EX?\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX): Direct costs involved in day to day operation. These could be fixed or variable. These are operational costs that contribute to your business running normally. You probably have to pay for these things every month or on a frequent basis.\nAsk: Can someone give me a few examples of operational costs?\nPotential answers:\nMarketing and advertisements,\nTravel,\nRent,\nMeetings,\nSupplies, \nSalaries, \netc. \n\nCapital Expenditure: Capital expenditure, or CapEx, are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets. These are one time purchases that relate to the long term business success (items that will last at least 1 year or longer). These items aren’t purchased frequently because they last a long time.\nAsk: Can someone give me a few examples of capital expenditures?\nPotential answers:\nComputers\nMachines\nLand/property\nFurniture\nIP/legal registration/patents\nEven the money you spend renovating your space count as CAP-EX\nOther investments that will last over 1 year\nEtc…\n\n\nResource Efficiency & CAP-EX, OP-EX\nResource efficiency investments can be either CAPEX or OPEX:\nCAPEX: Long-term assets that provide efficiency over time.\nExample: Solar panels (25+ years), energy-efficient equipment (5–10 years), water recycling systems (10+ years).\nOPEX: Short-term operational expenses that improve efficiency.\nExample: LED bulbs (if inexpensive), energy audits, staff training on conservation\nExample:\nA $3,000 solar panel investment is a CAPEX item that depreciates over 25 years, while an LED retrofit at $200 might be an OPEX cost.\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX): Direct costs involved in day to day operation.

Are these one time purchases or operational expenses?\nRent- Expense, (this is for 4 months so it is less than a year and doesn’t contribute to the long term value of your business)\nMarketing and advertising- Expense (this is for less than a year and doesn’t contribute to the long term value of your business (if it is flyers, social media advertisements, etc…). If you are purchasing roll ups, signs, investing in a logo or videos or other valuable long term assets, you can capitalize this. You can consider splitting it into 2 or more line items if you need)\nApp development- Capitalize (this will last several years and contribute to the long term success of your business)\nSignage- Capitalize (long term value)\nWebsite- Capitalize (long term value)\nYou will want to add up each category as well to see how you are spending your money (that is in the formula below the startup costs on the financial model)- You can see on the animation of this slide.\n\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nGive the entrepreneurs 10 minutes to fill in their startup costs to say if they will capitalize or expense each item on their startup costs and their personal contribution (we will use this information in the next part).\nThe trainer should go around the room and make sure that everyone is doing it correctly and answer any questions.\n\n\nThe method of spreading the cost of an asset over the course of its useful life.\nAMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION\nWhy do this?\nSmaller impact on P&L\nMore accurate #’s\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + demonstration\n\nNow that we have a clear picture of our startup costs, and we have determined if we will expense or capitalize on them, we can move into the next part, Amortization & depreciation. Do remember seeing this on your P&L? We said we would get to it later. Now we are here!\n\nAmortization and depreciation are ways to spread the cost of an asset over the course of its useful life. \nBy doing this, you will have a smaller impact on your P&L. When you buy very expensive assets that aren’t typical in your yearly expenses, you don’t want them to reflect on your P&L. This will give people the wrong idea of what you are spending month to month to operate your business. If it shows up as an expense on your profit and loss, that will look bad for investors or other people interested in your company. You want to minimize the expenses on the P&L to look more profitable.\nStay as accurate as possible to understand month to month or year to year changes. If you have random large expenses in your P&L, you wont get an accurate picture of your normal spending habits. \n\nAmortization is a method of spreading the cost of an intangible asset over a specific period of time, which is usually the course of its useful life. Intangible assets are non-physical assets that are nonetheless essential to a company, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The goal in amortizing an asset is to match the expense of acquiring it with the revenue it generates.\nExample: Let's say a company spends $50,000 to obtain a license, and the license in question will expire in 10 years. Since the license is an intangible asset, it should be amortized for the 10-year period leading up to its expiration date. Using the straight-line method of amortization, which is a method for charging a cost to an expense at a consistent rate over time, the company's annual amortization expense for the license will be $5,000 (that's $50,000/10 years), meaning the asset will decline in value by $5,000 every year.\nDepreciation: Like amortization, depreciation is a method of spreading the cost of an asset over a specified period of time, typically the asset's useful life. The purpose of depreciation is to match the expense of obtaining an asset to the income it helps a company earn. Depreciation is used for tangible assets, which are physical assets such as manufacturing equipment, business vehicles, and computers. Depreciation is a measure of how much of an asset's value has been used up at a given point in time.\nExample: Let's say a company purchases a new piece of equipment with an estimated useful life of 10 years for the price of $100,000. Using the straight-line method, the company's annual depreciation expense for the equipment will be $10,000 ($100,000/10 years). This is important because depreciation expenses are recognized as deductions for tax purposes. It is also possible for a company to use an accelerated depreciation method, where the amount of depreciation it takes each year is higher during the earlier years of an asset's life.\n\nFor the purpose of simplicity, we are going to put everything under depreciation for now, but you can separate them on your financials if you would like to be more detailed. \n10\n\nLIFETIME VALUE OF ASSETS\nTYPE\nAMOUNT\nNOTES\nESTIMATED USEFUL LIFETIME VALUE (IN YEARS)\nINFORMATION USED FOR DEPRECIATION\nYearly value\nMonthly value\nExpense\n$ 2,000\n4 months\n<1 yr\nExpense\n$1,920\nMarketing materials, SEO, social media advertising\n<1 yr\nCapitalize\n$15,000\nNative android and IOS\n8\n$1,875\n$156.3\nCapitalize\n$1,500\nOutdoor signage and decoration\n5\n$300\n$25\nCapitalize\n$2,500\nWebsite development\n5\n$500\n$41.7\nCapitalize\n$900\n5\n$180\n$15\nCapitalize\n$3000\nSolar Panel Installation\n25\n$120\n$10\nINFORMATION USED IN DEPRECIATION\nYearly Depreciation\nMonthly Depreciation\n$3,750.3\n$312.5\n25 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm + demonstration\n\n10 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm\nSo how do we calculate the depreciation? That is easy! \nWe just add 1 more column of information which is “estimated useful lifetime value (in years)\nSo for each of your capitalized expenses, think about how long it will last. Write the number of years in the yellow space. \nSome of these things have international standards (for example, a computer is said to have a useful life of 5 years even though it will still work after that time), but you can always estimate if you don’t know. \nThen you take the value of the item and divide it by the number of years to find its yearly value.\nDo an example on the board!\nAsk: You bought a new computer that you bought for $500. What is the monthly and yearly depreciation value?\nStep 1: determine lifetime value: 5 years\nStep 2: Divide value by the number of useful years: $500/5=$100/year\nStep 3: Divide yearly value by 12 months: $100/12=$8.333\nAsk: What does this mean?\nEvery year, your computer will lose about $100 in value or $8.33 per year.\nThis is shown as an expense on your P&L as $8.33 month to month instead of $500 all at once!\nYou will do this for all of your capitalized assets to show a total yearly and monthly depreciation value (show animation). \n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nShow how to fill this information on the excel sheet.\nShow where it is all added up\nShow how the depreciation shows up on the P&L by going to row 35 on the Profit and Loss tab. We incur a cost of $313 every month instead of $28,629 all at once from your capitalized expenses. In cell S35, that number changes because you got another investment and increased your assets (shown at the bottom of the startup costs tab). \n\n10 minutes: Activity\nHave the entrepreneurs fill in the information for their business\nSome might be having trouble so go around and help anyone who is struggling.\n\n11\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: Does anyone know what a balance sheet is? How is it different from P&L? What information do you find here that you don’t get on your P&L?\nPotential answers:\nWhat you have vs what you owe: Everything you have was paid by something. Either debt, your personal money, or investment. The document shows how you financed the things your business has. \nA balance sheet is one of the three major business statements.\nIt shows what the business owns, what it owes, and the value of the owner's investment in the business.\nYour balance sheet is a snapshot of your business health. It is evaluated in a single point in time. A P&L is evaluated over time. You watch it change year to year. \nYour balance sheet shows your financial health in a single point of time. You don’t evaluate it over time like a P&L. Instead, you look at your assets and liabilities in a single point in time to understand your net worth. \nMany financial ratios use information in your balance sheet. With these ratios you can get a better idea of your financial health. \n12\n\nSales \nPromotion\nTotal Assets  \nTotal Liabilities  \nTotal owner’s equity\nTotal Assets = Total Liabilities + Total owner’s equity\nPREPARE YOUR BALANCE SHEET\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nIn theory it is a very simple document summed up by a simple formula. The difficult part is creating an accurate representation of each of these categories. \nAs we said before, the balance sheet shows what you have vs what you owe. \nEverything that you own (total assets) need to equal what you owe (total liabilities +owners equity). Everything you own was paid for by something. Either your personal contribution, investment, a loan, or even a gift or grant.\n13\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS\nMore information about the balance sheet with examples. They don’t record all of this on their balance sheet so it can be confusing for entrepreneurs. But it is good to understand all the other parts of a balance sheet for future recording. \n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nAssets are the things that you have. They can be long term or current (short term) assets. These assets contribute to the success of your business and are (hopefully) contributing to your long term growth!\nCurrent assets: This includes cash and things that can easily turn into cash. Things such as inventory can be easily turned into cash by selling the item. These things usually can be converted to cash within the year.\nCash: Cash in the bank is an asset!\nAccounts receivable: The amount of money that people owe you. Maybe you already delivered a product/service but haven’t received payment yet. This should be reported!\nInventory: Do you have a lot of items that are ready to be sold? You can include their value here.\nPrepaid rent: Did you already pay for something and the value of that item is still owed to you? You can also include this. This is the same as prepaid salaries or other non-monetary things owed to you. \nLong term assets: These are assets that have value, but they aren’t very liquid (can’t turn into cash easily). This includes things like machinery, property, technology, and other big investments.\nLand: Property is valuable and should be recorded as something that adds value in your business.\nBuildings & improvements: Not only can you count the physical building, but you can count how much you spent to improve the building. Maybe you build a handicap ramp, or installed walls, even painting the walls count here. They are all investments into your business that will last a long time and increase the value of your assets.\nFurniture & fixtures: These are things that you have invested into your business and should be accounted for.\nGeneral equipment: Machinery and other equipment are valuable parts of your business that help you generate revenues and operate!\n\n14\n\nSales \nPromotion\nLIABILITIES + OWNERS EQUITY\nMore information about the balance sheet with examples. They don’t record all of this on their balance sheet so it can be confusing for entrepreneurs. But it is good to understand all the other parts of a balance sheet for future recording. \n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nNow that we have shown exactly what we have, we need to show how we paid for it. You are either paying for your business with money you (and investors) put in in exchange for owners equity, or you take out a loan (debt). Between these two things, it shows exactly how you paid for all of your assets.\n\nWhat you owe:\nCurrent liabilities: These are things that you owe people within the year. If you borrow money from someone and you need to pay it back. Or if you buy something from a business and haven’t paid for it yet (and you owe them the money within the year). \nAccounts payable: This is the opposite of accounts receivable (shown as an asset). If you have received a product or service, but you still owe cash, you would need to show that.  Any time that you owe cash to or services to people, you would put it as a current liability. \nLong term liabilities: This is what you owe that you don’t have to pay back for at least a year. If you take out a loan, it will usually be under here.\nOwners equity: This covers your personal contribution to your business and also investment. It is the owners (including partners) money that they have invested. Additionally, all of the money that your business has generated through sales that you have retained from the previous years would be reported here as well (this will keep your growing cash balanced- How are you getting the increased amount of cash on your assets? Through the retained earnings under owner’s equity- you don’t owe this to anyone except shareholders of your business, including yourself). \n15\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET\nTYPES OF COSTS\nCapitalize\n$28,629\nExpense\n$34,970\nTOTAL COST\n$63,599\nYEAR 1: SUMMARY OF CAPITALIZED COSTS(ASSETS)\nTechnology\n$20,329\nFurniture\n$1,700\nOther\n$-\nTOTAL CAPITALIZED COSTS\n$22,029\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nAssets\nCash\n$42,352\n$43,702\n$45,204\n$46,784\nTechnology\n$20,329\n$20,329\n$20,329\n$20,329\nFurniture\n$1,700\n$1,700\n$1,700\n$1,700\nOther\nAccumulated Depreciation\n$313\n$625\n$938\n$1,250\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$64,069\n$65,106\n$66,296\n$67,563\n10 minutes: Lecture + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Lecture\nAsk: Where do you think we are going to calculate our assets from?\nAnswer: For simplicity sake, we are not going to break down the assets into all of the subcategories. We are doing a high level version. As you actually track your inventory and other assets over time, you can easily put that information into the balance sheet. We have a simplified balance sheet right now. We are only going to include the assets that you have reported as either your personal contribution or as your startup costs. If you have other assets that you want reported, include them in your personal contribution! You want to show that you are putting skin in the game as well! \nYou can see how we categorized our assets based on the startup costs:\nYour assets can be categorized in many different ways. It depends on your business. It is up to you to make sure the categories are correct. These are categorized by the information in my startup costs. I categorized my capitalized assets into 2 main categories “technology”, “furniture”, and added a third that I didn’t actually use “other”. After you look through your costs, make the best grouping for your business. You might want to include machinery or inventory if you are buying it in bulk\nShow how the startup costs, capitalized expenses, depreciation, and balance sheet all work together.\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nThe trainer should share their screen and show where exactly to put the start up costs through a demonstration\nMake sure to show where to write “capitalize” or “expense” (make sure that these are spelled correctly otherwise the formula won’t work properly)\nShow them the formula that will summarize their start up costs (showing total costs, total expensed costs, and total capitalized costs)\nShow at the bottom where it says “YEAR 1: SUMMARY OF CAPITALIZED COSTS (ASSETS)”,\nThis is where there is a formula that adds up operating and capital expenditures. \nYour capitalized expenses can be categorized in many different ways. It depends on your business. It is up to you to make sure the categories are correct. These are categorized by the information in my startup costs. I categorized my capitalized assets into 2 main categories “technology”, “furniture”, and added a third that I didn’t actually use “other”. After you look through your costs, make the best grouping for your business.

In fact, we aren’t even going to focus on this section at all right now because most of you wont be getting a loan, but rather looking to win seed funding or get investment. \nIf you do take out a loan however, it would be shown on this part of your balance sheet. We will show you an example of what that would look like a little bit later (slides 18-20).\n\n17\n\nSales \nPromotion\nOWNER EQUITY ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nNOVEMBER\nDECEMBER\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nEQUITY\nCapital\n$63,599\n$63,599\n$63,599\n$63,599\nRetained Earnings\n$    -\n$    -\n$31,645\n$31,645\nNet Income\n$28,073\n$31,645\n$31,645\n$33,251\nTOTAL EQUITY\n$91,672\n$95,244\n$126,889\n$128,495\n5 minutes: Lecture + demonstration\n\nInstead, we will look here instead to explain how we are tracking owners equity and linking it to your assets.\nCapital: This is all the money in your business right now. It equals your total startup costs + you personal contribution (this is coming from what you ask for on the startup costs)\nRetained earnings: The retained earnings is the money that you keep in your business from the previous year. You can see how it accumulates over the year in your net income and then it shows in the second year. It is equal to the previous years net income. \nNet income: This is your bottom line reported month to month on your profit and loss tab. \nTotal equity: Your total equity is the sum of your capital, retained earnings, and net income. You pay for your assets (and cash) through the money you make through your business activities!\n\nWhen you add your total equity and total liabilities (from loans and money you owe other people/businesses) it should equal your total assets.\n\n18\n\nSales \nPromotion\nRESOURCE EFFICIENCY ROI\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nYEAR 3\n3-Year Total\nInvestment\t\n$3000\n$0\n$0\n$3000\nAnnual Savings\n$960\n$960\n$960\n$2880\nNet Benefit\n($2040)\n$960\n$960\n($120)\nCumulative Cash Flow\n($2040)\n($1080)\n($120)\n-\nPayback Period: 3.1 years\nROI after 5 years: 60%\n19\n\nHOW DOES IT CHANGE?\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: So how does this document change? What types of business activities would cause changes in this?\nPotential answers: \nIf assets or liabilities change\nYou might lose an asset or it decreases in value over time\nYou might buy a new asset. You would want to show that your business has increased in value. \nYou might also want to show how you paid for that asset (retained earnings, investment, debt, etc..)\n\nFacilitator Note:\n\"Let’s say you decide to invest in solar panels to reduce long-term electricity costs. This would show up as:\nInvestment: $3,000 (Solar Panels) added under Assets → Technology\nDepreciation Impact: $120/year or $10/month added to P&L → Depreciation\nCash Reduction: $3,000 deducted from Cash Reserves unless financed by a grant.\nAsk:\nHow does this change your financial health?\nWould this make your business stronger in the long run?\nPossible Answer:\nEven though cash is reduced in the short term, this investment will lower electricity costs each month, improving the company’s long-term profitability.\n\nRecap: The balance sheet will change as your assets and liabilities change. If you get an investment or take out a loan, that investment would show up in your assets as cash. Also there will be an increase in owners equity (assuming that the investment was for shares/equity) or there will be an increase in your liabilities if you have to pay that money back. \n\nTransition: Now we will take a look to see exactly how it changes.\n20\n\nSales \nPromotion\nBALANCE SHEET BEFORE A LOAN\nASSETS\nLIABILITIES AND OWNER’S EQUITY\nCash $3,000\nCurrent Liabilities $1,000\nInventory $0\nLoan and Long-term Liabilities $0\nPrepaid Salaries $2,500\nFurniture & Fixtures $8,000\nOwner’s Equity $12,500\nTOTAL ASSETS $13,500\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND OWNER'S EQUITY $13,500\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nSo this is a balance sheet before you take out a loan. Your balance sheet might look like this if you don’t win seed funding or get investment. \nIt looks a little different from the one we made, and it is different from others you will see online, but that is normal. This is a very simple version. Financial models will change slightly based on the business; however, the main components stay the same. You can see that we still have assets, liabilities, and owners equity here (which are the main parts of the balance sheet - What you have vs what you owe)\nAsk: So let’s take a look at this balance sheet. What do you see? What do you know about the business?\nPotential answers:\nThis is the money you put in. Maybe you put in $12,500 of your own. And $1000 from maybe a friend or family member. Although we don’t know exactly the details of where this money came from, we know what it means. \nWith that $13,500 (sum of the debt and ownership), you have been able to buy furniture, prepay some salaries, and keep a few thousand dollars as cash just in case. \n\nRecap: Remember, everything needs to be accounted for. All the money in the business is paying for something (it is balanced)\n\n21\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS\nLIABILITIES AND OWNER’S EQUITY\nCash $3,000\nCurrent Liabilities $1,000\nInventory $40,000\nLoan and Long-term Liabilities $50,000\nPrepaid Salaries $2,500\nFurniture & Fixtures $18,000\nOwner’s Equity $12,500\nTOTAL ASSETS $63,500\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND OWNER'S EQUITY $63,500\nBALANCE SHEET AFTER A LOAN\n20 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nNow let’s assume that you win money, get investment, or take out a loan. You will want to show how that cash injection will change your financials. With new cash, your business can now pay for more things. You will want to show what you are buying, and also where that money came from. Let’s look at an example together:\n\nAsk: Can anyone tell me what happened here (in the picture above)?\nAnswers: \nThis business took out a loan for $50,000. This is shown as a long term loan/liability because it will take over a year to pay it back (if you have to pay it back in less than a year it will be a current liability). \nTotal liabilities and owner’s equity raised to $63,500 because it is the total of the new loan + the original loan of $1000 + the $12,500 that you put in at the beginning (you might need to go back to the previous slide to show exactly how the right side of the balance sheet has changed).\nNow you have to do something with that new money which is shown. If you don’t do anything with the money, it will show up in your assets as cash. This means you have money you can use, but you haven’t spent anything.\nBut according to this balance sheet, the business did spend money. They spent $40,000 on inventory and $10,000 on more furniture and fixtures. \nNo matter how you spend that money, your assets will always equal the total liabilities and owner’s equity (because it will be cash or something else). \n\nRecap: What changed?\nLoans and long term liabilities increased by 50k. It went here because it is a loan you will have to pay back. Not equity. It is also long term because it isn’t meant to be paid back in less than a year. That 50k is a long term liability.\nWhere are you spending this money? You paid for inventory and furniture.\nSomeone looking at this would be interested to see how you spend your money. Is it sitting as cash? 50k as cash doesn’t grow for you. People want to see smart investments with the money. \n\nAnother example:\nAsk: You just saw an example of a loan, but what would it look like if you got investment? How would your balance sheet change?\nAnswers:\nThe amount of investment will be shown in owners equity. It is not a loan and it is not expected to be paid back.\nThe amount of investment would show up as an asset in some form (cash or another asset).\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nThis demonstration might be too complex to go over in class (considering all of the other work they have done so far). As it is not relevant for everyone, consider leaving the conversation high level if the class is having a hard time. You can go over this during advisory sessions for those interested.\nIf they are ready to go into another demonstration show the following points:\nShare your screen and go onto the financial model. Show how the balance sheet changes when you get a loan or investment.\nShow them how an investment would show up on their financial model. \nWhat are you buying: If you are capitalizing anything from this investment, you should show it on your balance sheet as an asset. Balance sheet rows 7-10 show the breakdown of how you are spending that investment.\n\nHow you are paying for the investment: \nIf equity investment: Owners equity on the balance sheet should show the past capital that was invested into the business + the new capital invested in business. The time of the change in owners equity will show the time of the new investment. \nIf loan: Long term debt on the balance sheet will show how much you borrowed and at what time. \nIt will also make a small impact on the P&L (depreciation and amortization will increase to reflect new assets)\n22\n\nON YOUR FINANCIALS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nNovember\nDecember\nJanuary\nFebruary\nEquity\nCapital\n$63,599\n$63,599\n$93,599\n93,599\nRetained earnings\n-\n-\n8,352\n8,352\nNet Income\n$ 7,400\n$8,352\n$7,235\n6,996\nTotal equity\n$ 70,999\n$71,951\n109,185\n108,946\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY\n$70,999\n$71,951\n109,185\n108,946\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nYou can see a change here in capital from year 1 to year 2 (from 63,599 to 93,599). \nAsk: What might have happened here?\nMore cash went into your business.

      "content": " I'll help you review the Cost Model and Balance Sheet decks and provide suggestions for integrating them more seamlessly with the Financial Model spreadsheet, following the Integrated Business Resilience Framework.\n\n## Key Observations\n\nAfter reviewing both presentations and the financial model, I notice these integration opportunities:\n\n1. **Sustainability as a Business Strategy**: The current decks present sustainability separately rather than as an integral part of business decision-making.\n  \n2. **Risk-Resilience Connection**: The Balance Sheet deck doesn't effectively connect financial structure to business resilience.\n\n3. **Efficiency Integration**: The Cost Model discusses efficiency but doesn't fully explore how resource efficiency creates long-term cost advantages.\n\n4. **Missing Value Alignment**: Neither deck strongly connects environmental choices with market differentiation and customer value.\n\n## Integration Recommendations\n\n### 1. Reframe Resource Efficiency as Strategic Business Advantage\n\n**Current State**: Page 6 of the Cost Model shows resource efficiency as a separate section rather than being integrated throughout.\n\n**Recommendation**: \n- Move the Resource Efficiency ROI calculation earlier in the Cost Model deck (around slide 5) as a core cost consideration\n- Add concrete examples showing how efficiency investments reduce costs over time\n- Connect to the Balance Sheet by showing how these investments appear in both places\n\nExample slide addition:\n```\nSTRATEGIC EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS\n                 Initial Cost    3-Year ROI    Payback Period\nSolar Panels      $3,000         60%          3.1 years\nLED Lighting      $500           85%          1.4 years\nWater Systems     $800           40%          2.5 years\n\n→ Appears on Balance Sheet as: Fixed Asset\n→ Reduces monthly operating costs by: $XXX\n→ Improves customer perception score by: XX%\n```\n\n### 2. Incorporate Risk Assessment into Cost Sections\n\n**Current State**: The decks discuss costs but not how they relate to business risks and resilience.\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Add a \"Risk & Resilience\" column to the cost planning sections\n- Show how certain costs (like diversifying suppliers) reduce vulnerability\n- Create visuals showing the relationship between financial decisions and business continuity\n\nExample modification for slide 15 in Cost Model:\n```\nSG&A EXPENSES\nItem               Monthly Cost    Risk Reduction Value\nLocal Suppliers    $XXX            Reduces supply chain disruption by XX%\nRenewable Energy   $XXX            Eliminates price volatility risk worth $XXX/year\n```\n\n### 3. Connect Financial Planning to the Business Efficiency Workbook\n\n**Current State**: The financial model and Business Efficiency Workbook operate independently.\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Create direct links between the Business Efficiency Workbook and the financial model\n- Add a slide showing how efficiency priorities from the workbook translate to financial inputs\n- Develop a unified view of how improvements affect all financial statements\n\nExample integration slide:\n```\nEFFICIENCY WORKBOOK → FINANCIAL MODEL INTEGRATION\n\nPriority Action          Efficiency Score    Financial Impact\nProcess Optimization    5.0                 -$100/month operational costs\nSolar Panel Investment  4.8                 -$22/month energy costs\n                                           +$3,000 fixed asset\nLocal Sourcing          2.2                 Supplier risk ↓ 30%\n```\n\n### 4. Align Balance Sheet with Resilience Framework\n\n**Current State**: The Balance Sheet presentation focuses on mechanics without emphasizing resilience.\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Add resilience metrics to the Balance Sheet section\n- Show how a strong balance sheet relates to business adaptability\n- Incorporate environmental asset valuation alongside traditional assets\n\nExample addition to Balance Sheet slide 18:\n```\nRESILIENCE INDICATORS FROM YOUR BALANCE SHEET\n\nCash Ratio: XX% (Target: >30% for crisis resilience)\nResource Efficiency Assets: $XXX (XX% of total assets)\nDiversification Score: XX/100\n```\n\n### 5. Develop \"No-Regrets Path\" Framework for Financial Decision Making\n\n**Current State**: Financial decisions are presented as purely economic choices.\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Create a decision framework highlighting investments that make sense in multiple scenarios\n- Emphasize choices that have financial benefits regardless of environmental considerations\n- Show how efficiency investments pay off even in worst-case scenarios\n\nExample framework slide:\n```\nNO-REGRETS FINANCIAL DECISIONS\n\n                    Positive ROI    Customer Value    Risk Reduction\nSolar Panels        ✓               ✓                 ✓\nLED Lighting        ✓               -                 ✓\nLocal Suppliers     ✓               ✓                 ✓\n```\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n\n1. **For Cost Model**:\n   - Update slide 5 to show how costs reflect values and risk management\n   - Modify slide 6 to connect COGS with resource efficiency \n   - Enhance slide 15 to incorporate risk metrics alongside financial ones\n   - Add a slide showing how the Business Efficiency Workbook priorities translate to actual line items\n\n2. **For Balance Sheet**:\n   - Add resilience metrics to slide 17\n   - Modify slide 18 to show how environmental investments appear on the balance sheet\n   - Create a visual connection between assets, liabilities, and business continuity\n   - Incorporate resource efficiency accounting into the fixed assets section\n\n3. **For Financial Model Integration**:\n   - Create a dedicated tab for Resource Efficiency Analysis in the model\n   - Add comparative projections showing efficiency vs. traditional approaches\n   - Implement risk scoring for different financial strategies\n\n## Specific Slide Modifications\n\n### Cost Model Deck:\n\n1. **Slide 5**: Add a \"Strategic Layer\" showing how costs reflect values and risk management\n2. **Slide 6**: Add efficiency comparison to standard COGS calculation  \n3. **Slide 12-13**: Add risk reduction value alongside cost metrics\n4. **Slide 15**: Incorporate the Resource Efficiency ROI calculation as a standard part of SG&A planning\n\n### Balance Sheet Deck:\n\n1. **Slide 17**: Add resilience indicators derived from balance sheet metrics\n2. **Slide 18**: Highlight how resource efficiency investments appear as assets\n3. **Slide 20**: Add a \"Resilience Effect\" column to show how balance sheet changes impact business stability\n\nBy implementing these changes, you'll create a more integrated approach that positions sustainability and efficiency as core business strategies rather than add-ons. This aligns perfectly with the Integrated Business Resilience Framework's business-first approach while ensuring practical tools are available for decision-making.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these recommendations?",

Develop \"No-Regrets Path\" Framework for Financial Decision Making\n\n**Current State**: Financial decisions are presented as purely economic choices.\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Create a decision framework highlighting investments that make sense in multiple scenarios\n- Emphasize choices that have financial benefits regardless of environmental considerations\n- Show how efficiency investments pay off even in worst-case scenarios\n\nExample framework slide:\n```\nNO-REGRETS FINANCIAL DECISIONS\n\n                    Positive ROI    Customer Value    Risk Reduction\nSolar Panels        ✓               ✓                 ✓\nLED Lighting        ✓               -                 ✓\nLocal Suppliers     ✓               ✓                 ✓\n```\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n\n1. **For Cost Model**:\n   - Update slide 5 to show how costs reflect values and risk management\n   - Modify slide 6 to connect COGS with resource efficiency \n   - Enhance slide 15 to incorporate risk metrics alongside financial ones\n   - Add a slide showing how the Business Efficiency Workbook priorities translate to actual line items\n\n2. **For Balance Sheet**:\n   - Add resilience metrics to slide 17\n   - Modify slide 18 to show how environmental investments appear on the balance sheet\n   - Create a visual connection between assets, liabilities, and business continuity\n   - Incorporate resource efficiency accounting into the fixed assets section\n\n3. **For Financial Model Integration**:\n   - Create a dedicated tab for Resource Efficiency Analysis in the model\n   - Add comparative projections showing efficiency vs. traditional approaches\n   - Implement risk scoring for different financial strategies\n\n## Specific Slide Modifications\n\n### Cost Model Deck:\n\n1. **Slide 5**: Add a \"Strategic Layer\" showing how costs reflect values and risk management\n2. **Slide 6**: Add efficiency comparison to standard COGS calculation  \n3. **Slide 12-13**: Add risk reduction value alongside cost metrics\n4. **Slide 15**: Incorporate the Resource Efficiency ROI calculation as a standard part of SG&A planning\n\n### Balance Sheet Deck:\n\n1. **Slide 17**: Add resilience indicators derived from balance sheet metrics\n2. **Slide 18**: Highlight how resource efficiency investments appear as assets\n3. **Slide 20**: Add a \"Resilience Effect\" column to show how balance sheet changes impact business stability\n\nBy implementing these changes, you'll create a more integrated approach that positions sustainability and efficiency as core business strategies rather than add-ons. This aligns perfectly with the Integrated Business Resilience Framework's business-first approach while ensuring practical tools are available for decision-making.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these recommendations?",

            "extracted_content": "Below is a fresh, step-by-step analysis that compares the original Cost Model and Balance Sheet decks with the updated recommendations. I've highlighted “Before” (the current state) vs. “After” (the improved version), followed by how to implement each change and why it matters. This gives you a clear roadmap to integrate these decks more seamlessly with the Financial Model spreadsheet, all while aligning with the Integrated Business Resilience Framework.\n\n1. Reframe Resource Efficiency as a Strategic Business Advantage\nBEFORE\nCost Model Deck: Resource efficiency might appear as a separate bullet or slide (e.g., “optional sustainability considerations”), without clear ROI examples.\nBalance Sheet Deck: Investments in efficiency (like solar panels, better insulation, etc.) are not explicitly shown under assets or future cost savings.\nFinancial Model: No direct linkage (e.g., a user can’t easily see how an efficiency measure impacts monthly costs or overall ROI).\nAFTER\nCost Model Deck\n\nMove resource efficiency content into the core COGS/SG&A slides.\nInclude concrete ROI calculations for efficiency measures (e.g., LED lighting, water-saving devices).\nShow payback period and long-term cost savings in the same slide where you list normal expenses.\nBalance Sheet Deck\n\nAdd a line item under “Fixed Assets” or “Property, Plant & Equipment” for resource-efficiency investments (e.g., “Solar Panels - $3,000”).\nUse notes or a small table to highlight the expected 3-year ROI or depreciation schedule.\nFinancial Model\n\nCreate a simple toggle or line item (e.g., “Energy-Saving Equipment” cost) under CAPEX.\nShow the resulting monthly cost reduction in Operating Expenses (e.g., a formula that subtracts $X from the monthly electricity expense once the asset is added).\nHOW to implement & WHY\nHow:\n\nIn the Cost Model slide where you summarize costs, add a column for “Efficiency Investment” with sub-columns for “Initial Cost,” “Ongoing Savings,” and “Payback Period.”\nIn the Balance Sheet slides, add an example line under assets: “Energy-Efficient Equipment.” Link that to the depreciation/amortization schedule in your Financial Model.\nIn your Financial Model spreadsheet, add a tab or section labeled “Efficiency ROI.” Connect it to your monthly cost calculations (e.g., electricity, water bills).\nWhy:\n\nThis reframing shows participants how sustainability can be profitable, lowers operational risk from volatile energy prices, and appeals to eco-conscious customers (market differentiation).\nIt aligns directly with the “Business-First Approach” (from the Integrated Business Resilience Framework) by showing concrete financial benefits.\n2. Incorporate Risk Assessment into Cost Sections\nBEFORE\nCost Model Deck: Lists typical SG&A or COGS but doesn’t show how certain expenditures (like diversifying suppliers) mitigate risk.\nBalance Sheet Deck: Does not explicitly address risk reduction in asset/liability structure.\nFinancial Model: Lacks a scenario approach or sensitivity analysis for cost volatility (e.g., material costs rising 10%).\nAFTER\nCost Model Deck\n\nAdd a Risk & Resilience column to the SG&A or “Other Costs” slides.\nExample: If you choose local suppliers, highlight “Reduces supply chain disruption risk” in that column, along with a possible cost premium or cost savings.\nBalance Sheet Deck\n\nIntroduce a slide or note referencing “Risk-Reducing Assets” (e.g., holding extra inventory or investing in onsite energy generation).\nShow how these appear in Assets (inventory, backup equipment) vs. potential liabilities if underfinanced.\nFinancial Model\n\nAdd a scenario analysis feature: “If raw material costs rise by 10%,” how does that change your monthly outflow?\nIncorporate a simple risk scoring for major cost categories (e.g., “High risk for price volatility: electricity; Medium risk: packaging supplies”).\nHOW to implement & WHY\nHow:\n\nOn the Cost Model slides, create a small table that includes “Item,” “Monthly Cost,” and a new column “Risk Reduction Impact.”\nOn the Balance Sheet summary slide, add bullet points explaining how certain assets reduce business risks (like “buffer inventory,” “energy independence”).\nIn the Financial Model, add a “Scenario Planning” tab or a “What If” column to quickly see the impact of changes in cost.\nWhy:\n\nRisk management is a core principle of resilience. By explicitly tagging each cost line item with its risk reduction component, entrepreneurs learn why they might pay more for a local supplier or more durable materials (fewer disruptions, better stability).\nThis fosters long-term viability and aligns with the framework’s call to incorporate risk assessment into business planning.\n3. Connect Financial Planning to an Efficiency/“No-Regrets Path” Workbook\nBEFORE\nThe Cost Model and Balance Sheet are taught as stand-alone. The “no-regrets path” concept (customer alignment, values-based decisions) may only be discussed in theory.\nThe Financial Model has no direct references to a “Business Efficiency Workbook” or any separate tool to track these strategic decisions.\nAFTER\nCost Model Deck\n\nInsert a slide showing “No-Regrets Path” examples: items that always save money and improve brand image. E.g., “Switching to minimal packaging saves $XX monthly, aligns with eco-conscious consumers, and reduces waste.”\nBalance Sheet Deck\n\nIntroduce a small table connecting Value-Aligned Investments (like reusable packaging systems) to long-term asset value or intangible brand equity.\nFinancial Model\n\nProvide a linked worksheet for “Business Efficiency & Values” (or “No-Regrets Path”)—where each recommended action auto-populates to the main model.\nShow how these actions incrementally decrease monthly operating expenses or increase intangible brand value.\nHOW to implement & WHY\nHow:\n\nIn the Cost Model slides, for each item you add (COGS, SG&A), include an example of a “no-regrets” upgrade or shift—like compostable packaging or LED lighting.\nIn the Balance Sheet slides, highlight the intangible or brand-equity boost from these “values-driven” assets (like a relevant intangible asset row or footnote).\nIn the Financial Model, create a tab “No-Regrets Path.” Each recommended action has a cost line item (CAPEX or OPEX) and a linked formula that modifies the main statements (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow).\nWhy:\n\nThis removes the guesswork: entrepreneurs see that a “no-regrets” decision is actually profitable in multiple scenarios (market growth or slowdown).\nIt reinforces the framework’s principle that “values” and “efficiency” can go together, delivering both cost savings and brand differentiation.\n4. Align the Balance Sheet with Resilience Metrics\nBEFORE\nThe Balance Sheet deck focuses on standard categories (assets, liabilities, equity) without referencing resilience indicators or how specific assets reduce risk/improve sustainability.\nThe Financial Model likely just has a standard Balance Sheet tab (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) without resilience commentary.\nAFTER\nBalance Sheet Deck\n\nAdd a slide on “Resilience Indicators” derived from the balance sheet. For instance:\nCash Ratio (indicating crisis resilience),\nEfficiency Assets (% of total assets invested in eco-efficiency),\nDiversification Score (how broad your asset base or supply chain is).\nShow how intangible assets or brand value from eco-investments factor into “Goodwill” or “Other Assets.”\nFinancial Model\n\nCreate a small formula or table that calculates these resilience metrics automatically:\nE.g., (Cash / Total Assets) * 100 = Cash Ratio %\n(Eco-Efficient Assets / Total Fixed Assets) * 100 = Efficiency Ratio %\nHOW to implement & WHY\nHow:\n\nAdd a new “Resilience Metrics” slide in the Balance Sheet deck that calculates, for example, the Cash Ratio, Eco-Asset Percentage, and shows the “target range.”\nIn your Financial Model’s “Balance Sheet” tab, add columns to track “Eco-Asset Value” or “Sustainability-Linked Investments” so the ratio can be automatically calculated.\nWhy:\n\nThis answers the question: “How robust is my business if something goes wrong?” by letting entrepreneurs see at a glance if they have enough cash, how much of their business capital is in risk-reducing or efficiency-boosting assets, etc.\nThe framework emphasizes linking environmental improvements to financial performance—these metrics do it directly.\n5. Develop a “No-Regrets Path” Framework for Financial Decision-Making\nBEFORE\nFinancial decisions appear purely economic (cost vs. revenue).\n“No-Regrets Path” might be briefly mentioned in training but not systematically used.\nAFTER\nCost Model Deck\n\nDedicate a slide or sub-section explicitly to the “No-Regrets Decision Framework”:\n(1) Does it improve operational efficiency?\n(2) Does it reduce risk?\n(3) Does it resonate with customer values?\nBalance Sheet Deck\n\nShowcase how “No-Regrets” choices become either intangible brand equity or capitalized assets that boost your company’s net worth.\nFinancial Model\n\nAdd a small decision matrix or a column in your CAPEX tab labeled “No-Regrets?” with criteria and a simple “Yes/No” or scoring system.\nSummarize the impact on the bottom line: “This LED upgrade = 2-month payback, improves brand image, minimal risk.”\nHOW to implement & WHY\nHow:\n\nIn the Cost Model slides, literally place a “No-Regrets Framework” box and walk through an example (like “Should we invest in a packaging redesign?”).\nIn the Balance Sheet slides, point out how intangible brand value can show up in “goodwill” or “other intangible assets” if it significantly differentiates your brand.\nIn your Financial Model, add a short list of 3–5 typical “No-Regrets” items, each with cost, payback, and intangible value references.\nWhy:\n\nEmbedding a decision framework helps entrepreneurs quickly see that some investments “always” pay off. This is a practical approach to linking values (like sustainability) with profitability.\nIt underscores the framework’s principle that businesses can avoid regret by aligning investments with both financial gain and customer/market values.\nSummary of “Before” vs. “After” Upgrades\nBelow is a condensed table to visualize the main improvements:\n\nArea\tBefore\tAfter\n1. Resource Efficiency\t- Buried in separate sustainability slides\n- No direct link to ROI\t- Central to cost slides\n- Clear ROI table: initial cost, payback, monthly savings\n- Shown as an asset on the balance sheet + monthly cost reductions in the P&L and financial model\n2. Risk Assessment\t- Not tied explicitly to cost categories\n- Missing risk metrics\t- Add “Risk & Resilience” column in COGS/SG&A\n- Show how each cost choice mitigates or increases risk\n- Scenario planning in the financial model (price volatility, supply chain disruptions)\n3. Efficiency Workbook\t- No official workbook or “no-regrets path” linking costs to strategic decisions\t- A new “Efficiency/No-Regrets” slide in Cost Model\n- Values-based items that reduce costs or improve brand\n- Single place to track all actions linking to the financial model\n4. Resilience Metrics\t- Balance sheet only covers standard items\n- No mention of sustainability ROI\t- Additional lines: “Eco-Assets” or “Resource-Efficient Assets”\n- Resilience ratio calculations (e.g., cash ratio, diversification index)\n- Quick snapshot on how stable the business is if external shocks occur\n5. No-Regrets Path\t- Mentioned in theory only\n- No structured usage in financial planning\t- Dedicated framework slide in Cost Model\n- Ties intangible brand equity (customer values) to CAPEX decisions\n- Mark “No-Regrets” items in the financial model, showing guaranteed ROI or brand boost\nHow to Execute These Changes Step by Step\nRevise Slide Sequences\n\nCost Model: Move sustainability/efficiency slides right after you introduce the concept of COGS and SG&A.\nBalance Sheet: Insert a new slide just after explaining “What is a Balance Sheet?” titled “Resilience & Balance Sheet.”\nAdd New Columns and Rows\n\nIn your Cost Model slides (COGS, SG&A), add a column titled “Risk/Resilience” or “Efficiency Gains.”\nIn your Balance Sheet slides, show new asset rows for efficiency investments or intangible assets.\nLink to the Financial Model\n\nIn the Financial Model spreadsheet, add:\nA “Scenario Planning” tab for risk changes (e.g., 10% material cost increase).\nA “No-Regrets Path” or “Efficiency ROI” tab that includes the action, the cost, and the monthly savings.\nInclude Resilience Metrics\n\nOn the Balance Sheet tab of the spreadsheet, add a line or column for “Eco-Asset Value,” “Diversification Score,” or “Cash Ratio.”\nOn a separate “Metrics” or “Dashboard” tab, automatically calculate and display these resilience indicators.\nEmbed Examples\n\nFor each new slide or column, offer a worked example (like LED lighting, local supplier costs, or solar panels). Show the cost, ROI, risk reduction, and intangible brand benefits.\nFacilitator Notes\n\nIn your slides’ speaker notes, prompt the audience to think about risk: “How might a spike in fuel prices hurt your margins? Could investing in e-vehicles or local suppliers reduce that vulnerability?”\nEncourage them to use the “No-Regrets Path” with a mini-checklist: “(1) Does it lower cost? (2) Does it reduce risk? (3) Does it align with customer values?”\nFinal Thoughts\nBy weaving these “Before” vs. “After” changes throughout your Cost Model, Balance Sheet, and Financial Model:\n\nYou integrate sustainability and risk management as core strategic advantages, not an afterthought.\nYou create a cohesive storyline: from cost calculations (COGS, SG&A) → to asset investments on the balance sheet → to scenario-based financial modeling.\nParticipants see direct financial benefits (ROI, payback periods) while also building resilience (risk reduction, stable supply chains, strong brand).\nThis step-by-step approach ensures clarity for trainers and entrepreneurs alike. Each module flows logically into the next, with consistent references to efficiency, resilience, and customer values—the core of the Integrated Business Resilience Framework."

Integrated COGS Calculator (Cost Model - Enhanced Slide)\n\nThis updates your existing COGS slide to include efficiency options.\n\n```markdown\n# Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\n\n| Item | Standard Cost | Efficient Alternative | Savings/Unit | Annual Savings |\n|------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| T-Shirt | $10.00 | $8.50 (recycled fabric) | $1.50 | $1,800 |\n| Packaging | $0.75 | $0.60 (minimal design) | $0.15 | $180 |\n| Shipping | $3.50 | $2.75 (optimized routes) | $0.75 | $900 |\n\n## Risk Reduction Benefits:\n- **Recycled fabric:** Less vulnerable to cotton price volatility\n- **Minimal packaging:** Reduces plastic supply chain dependency \n- **Optimized shipping:** Lower exposure to fuel price fluctuations\n\n*Replace or enhance your existing COGS slide*\n```\n\n## 5. Balance Sheet with Efficiency Assets (Balance Sheet - Enhanced Slide)\n\nThis enhances your existing balance sheet slide to highlight efficiency investments.\n\n```markdown\n# Balance Sheet: Strategic Assets\n\n## ASSETS\n- **Cash:** $3,000\n- **Inventory:** $5,000\n- **Fixed Assets:**\n  - Standard Equipment: $12,000\n  - **Efficiency Assets:** $4,500\n    - *Solar Installation: $3,000*\n    - *Water-Saving Systems: $800*\n    - *LED Lighting: $700*\n\n## LIABILITIES AND EQUITY\n- **Current Liabilities:** $2,500\n- **Long-term Debt:** $7,000\n- **Owner's Equity:** $15,000\n\n**Note:** Efficiency assets reduce monthly expenses by $125 and enhance brand value by an estimated 5-10%\n\n*Replace or enhance your existing balance sheet slide*\n```\n\n## Implementation for Financial Model\n\nTo integrate these concepts into the financial model spreadsheet, add these specific elements:\n\n1. **Resource Efficiency Analysis Tab**:\n   - Copy the Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator table\n   - Add formulas that:\n     - Calculate monthly savings (Annual ÷ 12)\n     - Automatically reduce relevant expense lines\n     - Show cumulative savings over the 3-year period\n\n2. **Enhanced Balance Sheet Tab**:\n   - Add a line item under Fixed Assets called \"Resource Efficiency Assets\"\n   - Include a small table showing depreciation schedule for these assets\n   - Calculate resilience metrics (Cash Ratio, etc.) in a separate section\n\n3. **No-Regrets Decision Section**:\n   - Create a simple decision matrix for common business purchases\n   - Include columns for Efficiency Impact, Risk Reduction, and Customer Value\n   - Provide a \"Recommendation\" column that automatically calculates based on inputs\n\n## Roll-Out Strategy\n\nFor maximum impact with minimum changes:\n\n1. **Start with the ROI Calculator** - This creates the biggest mindset shift\n2. **Add the No-Regrets Framework** - Provides a practical decision tool\n3. **Enhance existing COGS slide** - Shows alternatives immediately\n4. **Add Resilience Metrics** - Connects to long-term business health\n5. **Update Balance Sheet** - Shows how these investments are tracked\n\nThese five focused changes will create a cohesive story while requiring minimal rework of your existing materials. They directly address the Integrated Business Resilience Framework recommendations while providing tangible, practical tools entrepreneurs can use immediately.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any specific element or provide additional slide content?",

      "content": " I'll focus on creating practical slide content that connects directly with the specific spreadsheet sections in the financial model you've shared. Here are specific, implementable slides you can add to streamline the Cost Model and Balance Sheet presentations:\n\n## 1. Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator (Add to Cost Model)\n\nThis slide connects directly to page 5 of your financial model (the Resource Efficiency Analysis section that already exists):\n\n```markdown\n# Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator\n\n| Investment | Initial Cost | Monthly Savings | Annual Savings | Payback Period | 3-Year ROI |\n|------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Solar Panels | $3,000 | $80 | $960 | 38 months | 60% |\n| LED Lighting | $500 | $20 | $240 | 25 months | 144% |\n| Water Systems | $800 | $25 | $300 | 32 months | 113% |\n\n## How to Use This in Your Financial Model:\n1. Enter these values in the **\"Resource Efficiency Analysis\"** table (Cost Assumptions tab, section 3)\n2. Include initial costs in your **Capex tab** under \"Solar Panels\" (already has a 25-year useful life)\n3. Monthly savings will reduce relevant SG&A expenses in your model\n\n*Note: These investments show up as fixed assets in your balance sheet while generating ongoing monthly savings*\n```\n\n## 2. Integrated COGS Calculator with Efficiency Options (Add to Cost Model)\n\nThis connects to both the COGS section and the Resource Efficiency tabs:\n\n```markdown\n# COGS with Efficiency Options\n\n| Product | Standard Approach | Efficient Alternative | Savings/Unit | Annual Savings (1,200 units) |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| T-Shirt | $10.00 (standard cotton) | $8.50 (recycled blend) | $1.50 | $1,800 |\n| Packaging | $0.75 (plastic) | $0.60 (minimal design) | $0.15 | $180 |\n| Shipping | $3.50 (standard) | $2.75 (consolidated) | $0.75 | $900 |\n\n## How to Implement in Your Financial Model:\n1. In the **Pricing Model tab**, add both options for each product\n2. In the **Cost Assumptions tab**, update your COGS with the efficient option\n3. Add the difference as \"Waste Reduction\" in the Resource Efficiency section\n\n*Note: Each option is a \"No-Regrets\" decision - saving money while reducing environmental impact*\n```\n\n## 3. No-Regrets Decision Framework (Add to Cost Model)\n\nThis slide provides a practical decision-making tool that works with the existing financial model:\n\n```markdown\n# No-Regrets Decision Framework\n\n## For each major business expense or investment, ask:\n\n| Question | Impact on Financial Model |\n|----------|---------------------------|\n| Does it improve efficiency? | Reduces monthly expenses in SG&A tab |\n| Does it reduce risk? | Improves business resilience (less vulnerable to price changes) |\n| Does it align with customer values? | Potential for higher pricing or increased sales volume |\n\n## Example Analysis: Solar Panel Investment\n- Cost: $3,000 (Capital Expenditures tab, Solar Panels, 25-year useful life)\n- Monthly savings: $80 (reduces electricity costs in SG&A)\n- Risk reduction: Protected from energy price increases\n- Customer perception: Positive brand differentiation\n- **Decision**: ✓ Proceed (Full payback in ~3 years, continues saving for 22+ more)\n\n*Fill out this analysis for each major investment decision*\n```\n\n## 4. Balance Sheet with Efficiency Assets (Add to Balance Sheet Deck)\n\nThis directly connects to how efficiency investments appear in the Balance Sheet tab:\n\n```markdown\n# Balance Sheet: Efficiency Assets Integration\n\n## ASSETS\n### Fixed Assets Section:\n- Standard equipment: $12,000\n- **Resource efficiency assets**: $4,500\n  - *Solar installation: $3,000*\n  - *Water-saving systems: $800*\n  - *LED lighting: $700*\n\n## Financial Model Implementation:\n1. Add these items to your **Capital Expenditures (Capex) tab** with proper useful life\n2. They will automatically appear in your **Balance Sheet** under Fixed Assets\n3. Their depreciation will appear in your **Income Statement**\n4. Their expense reduction will appear in your **SG&A expenses**\n\n*Note: These strategic assets appear identical to other fixed assets but provide ongoing cost reduction*\n```\n\n## 5. Resilience Metrics Dashboard (Add to Balance Sheet Deck)\n\nThis integrates with the Financial Ratios tab in your spreadsheet:\n\n```markdown\n# Business Resilience Metrics\n\n| Metric | Formula | Target | Where in Your Model |\n|--------|---------|--------|---------------------|\n| **Cash Ratio** | Cash ÷ Current Liabilities | >30% | Financial Ratios tab |\n| **Resource Efficiency %** | Eco-Assets ÷ Total Fixed Assets | >15% | Fixed Assets section |\n| **Efficiency ROI** | Annual Savings ÷ Invested Capital | >25% | Resource Efficiency Analysis |\n\n## Impact Calculation:\n- Each $1,000 invested in efficiency = ~$250 annual savings\n- Solar panel ROI (60%) exceeds average business investment ROI (15-25%)\n- Every 1% increase in Cash Ratio = ~1 additional week of business continuity\n\n*These metrics appear in your Financial Ratios tab and can be calculated quarterly*\n```\n\n## 6. Spreadsheet Implementation Guidelines\n\nThis slide provides specific instructions for implementing these changes in the financial model:\n\n```markdown\n# Implementing Resilience in Your Financial Model\n\n## Required Spreadsheet Updates:\n\n1. **Cost Assumptions Tab**\n   - The Resource Efficiency Analysis section is already set up for your inputs\n   - Add specific efficiency investments with monthly/annual savings\n\n2. **Capex & Depreciation Tab**\n   - Add \"Solar Panels\" (already listed) with 25-year useful life\n   - Add \"LED Lighting\" with 5-year useful life\n   - Add \"Water Systems\" with 10-year useful life\n\n3. **Balance Sheet Tab**\n   - These investments will automatically appear as Fixed Assets\n   - No manual updates needed here\n\n4. **Income Statement Tab**\n   - Reduced costs will automatically reflect in lower utility expenses\n   - Depreciation will automatically increase slightly\n\n*These changes create a complete picture of how efficiency investments flow through all statements*\n```\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\nFor maximum impact with minimal changes, I recommend implementing these slides in this order:\n\n1. **Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator** - This directly connects to the already existing section in your financial model on page 5\n2. **No-Regrets Decision Framework** - Provides a decision tool that uses the existing structure\n3. **Balance Sheet with Efficiency Assets** - Shows how investments appear in the fixed assets section\n4. **Integrated COGS Calculator** - Enhances the pricing model with efficiency options\n5. **Resilience Metrics Dashboard** - Connects to the Financial Ratios tab for advanced users\n\nThese additions create a cohesive storyline while requiring minimal changes to your existing financial model. The Resource Efficiency section on page 5 is your greatest asset, as it's already built to handle these types of calculations.\n\nWould you like me to focus on any particular slide in more detail or explain how it connects to a specific section of the spreadsheet?",

As we did with the revenue model, we will use the finance worksheet as a way to play around with our costs and see where we can afford have higher costs, and see where we will actually need to cut our costs.\n1\n\nBreak down the different types of business costs. \nForecast ongoing business costs.\nBuild out the next step of your P&L statement.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nBreak down the types of costs shown in a profit and loss statement.\nUnderstand all the elements that contribute to your ongoing business costs.\nBuild out the next step of your P&L statement.\n\n2\n\n*https://strategyzer.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/topics/113454-using-our-tools-canvases-methods\nREVENUE STREAMS\nCOST STRUCTURE\nCUSTOMER SEGMENT\nCHANNELS\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nVALUE PROPOSITION\nKEY RESOURCES\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nKEY PARTNERS\nYOUR BUSINESS MODEL\n4 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nReview our location on the BMC\nWe are always coming back here to the BMC.  Last week we took a look at your revenue streams to try and forecast revenues for the next three years, and today we will look at the other side, which are your costs. You can’t run a business without incurring some expenses along the way. You usually need to pay to create and deliver value to your customer segments. We will spend this session breaking down the different types of costs and forecasting those like we did for your revenues. \n\nAsk: Why is it important to have a clear picture of your costs before you start your business?\nPotential answers could be:\nEven if you are making sales and your situation is good, if you can’t control your costs, your profitability or cash flow could be ruined. \nIt is necessary for planning. If you want to hit a certain number of sales, you should think about what you need to do to actually make those sales (and what you need to spend). \nBy laying out your costs, you can think more strategically about new systems or techniques to lower them (maybe through partnerships or new and innovative systems)\n\nProfit and loss\n  Revenue model\n  Cost model\n\nBalance sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nRecap: Last we worked on the revenue model.

Can someone give me a few examples \nWrite all answers on the whiteboard or Jamboard. \nGroup answers so that you get categories for COGS, salaries, and SG&A (you can have other groups if necessary). \nPotential Answer\nEntrepreneurs will give a variety of answers, write them all down.\nGroup their answers to highlight the costs below:\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS): Direct costs of producing an item sold by a company (e.g., materials, direct labor).\nSalaries: Team and staff payments (if directly tied to production, might be COGS).\nSelling, general, and administrative (SG&A): Indirect costs like rent, marketing, and overhead.\nConsider your costs strategically, they represent what you care about and communicate that to your customers:\nCosts reflect values: Do you prioritize efficiency, quality, or resilience?\nEfficiencies save money over time: Smart investments (e.g., longer-lasting materials, reducing waste, energy-efficient choices) can lower costs long-term.\nExample: Switching to LED lights may have an upfront cost but reduces long-term electricity expenses.\nActivity Prompt (Discussion 5-10 min):\nWhat costs matter most to your business?\nHow could aligning with values help manage risks and costs?\nExample: If your priority is operational efficiency, would bulk ordering, material choices, or equipment upgrades help lower costs over time?\nGroup responses into COGS, Salaries, SG&A as before.\n1 minute: Transition\nToday, we will talk in more detail about COGS, Salaries, and SG&A.  These are these are key categories in your profit and loss statement.\nNext week we will go deeper in your start up costs, including capital expenditure vs. operating expenditure..\n\n6\n\nCOGS\n40 minutes: Lecture, brainstorm, demonstration (this includes hidden slides 7-11)\n\nThe first thing we will go over are the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Again COGS are the direct costs of producing an item sold by a company. This includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the product itself. \nSo for example, if you sell T-shirts, you need to calculate the cost of actually producing that item. Whether you are buying it from someone else, or producing it from scratch, these costs have to be accounted for.\n\n\n30 minutes: Brainstorm \nWe will do two examples together on the board (a very simple example and a complex one).\nThe entrepreneurs should lead the conversation and figure out how to calculate the unit economics of the examples (the price of one scoop of ice cream for example) \nThe hidden slides 7-10 are for trainers to go deeper on how to facilitate the discussion for each part of the COGS calculation (keep in mind that the slides are animated so might have a few layers of information).\n\n5 minutes: Example 1 (simple)\nHow do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business? – slide 7\nGive background info on business:\nYou know a tub of ice cream costs you $9 to buy from your supplier\nIt also costs you $1 per container to put your own label on the tub ice cream (this is agreed to with the supplier). \nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell\nAsk: What if you don’t sell ice cream by the tub, you sell it by the scoop?\nAnswer: We need to figure out how many scoops are in 1 tub of ice cream, then divide. \nLet’s say there are 100 scoops of ice cream in a tub\n$10/100 scoops = $1 per scoop\n\n5 minutes Example 2 (advanced): \nThat was easy right? What if you don’t know the price of a tub of ice cream? – Slides 7-11\nAsk: What would you do to calculate the cost of 1 scoop?\nGo through a detailed example of calculating the costs of something from scratch. In hidden slides 7-11 we go through how to calculate the price of 1 scoop of ice cream. The general layout is as follows:\nIdentify what goes into making the item (identify all the supplies/ingredients) –Slide 8\nIdentify the price of everything you buy (that goes into what you are making) – Slide 8\nFigure out how much of each ingredient you use (what you buy vs what you use) – Slides 8 & 9 \nLink unit cost to sales – Slide 10 & 11\n\n10-15 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \n7\n\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nItem\nNormal cost \nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\nDay Tour\n$90.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\nItem\nNormal cost \nBulk order price\nBulk order requirement\nDelivery fee (charged on business)\nBranded T-Shirt\n$10.00\n$5.00\n30\n$2.00\nHomemade Snack\n$0.08\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nDay Tour\n$90.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nWeekend Tour\n$200.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Gold\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\nSubscription: Premium\n$0.00\n$0.00\n0\n$0.00\n40 minutes: Brainstorm + demonstration\n\nCalculating COGS can be simple or highly complex depending on the product.\nA basic approach: Make a simple chart to highlight how much each unit costs your business.\n\nSimple examples:\nExample: How do you calculate COGS for an ice cream business?\nGive background info on business:\nA tub of ice cream costs $9 from your supplier.\nLabeling adds $1 per tub.\nTotal COGS per tub: $10.\nAsk: How can you figure out your COGS?\nAnswer: It costs you $10 for every tub of ice cream you sell \n\nAnother example: A t-shirt costs you $5 +$2 delivery cost. You would put the sale type as a T-shirt and the unit cost is $7. \n\nActivity (30 min):\nDevelop your COGS, and then consider a strategic change that might be able to reduce costs\nStep 1: Calculate COGS for your business.\nStep 2: Identify one strategic tweak (e.g., bulk purchase, green sourcing, supplier negotiation) that could lower costs long-term.\nDiscussion: Where in your production costs can you improve efficiency? Would bulk purchasing, different suppliers, or alternative materials reduce costs?\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration \nGo onto the financial model and show the simple COGS calculation chart. (Old, will remove)\nPoint out areas that can add to your COGS such as delivery, bulk orders, maybe you can add something like product customization, etc…  (Old, will remove)\n\nIf you are not calculating any COGS, feel free to remove these rows altogether.\n\n\n8\n\n We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream.\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurement used when making the product)\nPrice\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n(10-15 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nLet’s take the example of an ice cream shop.\nAsk: We are an ice-cream shop, and we would like to know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream. There are several ways to do this, so lets think about how we want to approach this.\nHave a discussion on the board to see if the class can figure out how to determine how much a tub of ice cream costs, or even one ice cream cone. Guide the entrepreneurs to calculate this on the whiteboard before showing them the answer.\nManage the flow of the discussion to cover the following points:\nTo make it easier, first let’s see how much it would cost us to make a tub of ice cream. You would never make 1 scoop of ice cream, you make a large amount and then sell the scoops individually. So lets say that in our tub of ice cream, there are 100 scoops.\nFirst figure out the ingredients you need to make this tub of ice cream. Write down all of the ingredients you would need to make ice cream on the white board (it is ok to estimate). \nPotential answers could be:\nSugar\nMilk\nSalt\nOreos\nEtc….\nWhen you buy this ingredient, how much do your buy (1 kilo, 1 package, 100 pieces, etc…). Write that down next to the ingredient itself.\nHow much did you pay for the ingredients? Write that down as well so you can calculate how much you actually spend\nTransition to next slide: Great, the first steps are done, now what do we do? \n\nNote to trainer: We are not ice cream experts, so we are going to stay simple for now. If this was really a business we are working on, we would need to calculate the real costs and know the real ingredients. This is just a simple example so we are making some things up.\nIt is ok, if the group comes up with a different answer from the example shown. \n\n9\n\nBut I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! \nI won’t have accurate costs estimates!\n  COST OF GOODS SOLD (COGS)\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nWhat is the quantity you get when you buy the item?\nQuantity purchased\n(using the unit of measurment used when making the product)\nPrice\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\nChocolate\n2.5 KILOS (2500 grams)\n2500\n$8\n800\n$2.56\nSugar\n1 KILO (5 cups)\n5\n$4\n5\n$4.00\nMilk\n1 GALLON (16 cups)\n16\n$2\n10\n$1.25\nVanilla\n1 BOTTLE (32 oz)\n32\n$10\n5\n$1.56\nOreo\nBOX OF 100\n100\n$15\n20\n$3.00\nNut Mix\n1 KILO (8.47 cups)\n8.47\n$5\n0.5\n$0.30\nCups\n100 CUPS\n100\n$20\n$     -\nCones\n100 CONES\n100\n$12\n100\n$12.00\n(5-10 minutes: Discussion + brainstorm) – time accounted for on slide 6 \n\nSome entrepreneurs might point out “But I don’t use all the ingredients when I make ice cream! I won’t have accurate cost estimates!”. Make sure to explain how to accurately calculate COGS considering the fact that they won’t use all of their ingredients.\nMake sure when you write out the quantity you are buying, you convert it to the measurements that you will use when making the ice cream. For example, you buy 1 Kilo of sugar, but you cook with cups, so write it out as 5 cups as well (as you can see in the image). \nThe next step is to write down how much of the ingredient you use to make a tub of ice cream. From all that information, you can find the amount you spend on just the ingredients you use. This means you can use the rest of your ingredients and not miscount your costs.\nIf each tub has about 100 scoops, you can divide the tub price by 100 to get the cost per scoop.\nNow you know how much it costs to make 1 scoop of ice cream!\n\nTransition: \nAsk: What do you guys think is the next step? Now that we know how much 1 scoop of ice cream, what do we use that information for?\nWe need to see how much we are spending month to month to produce the ice-cream that we are selling\nMultiply price per scoop by the number of ice cream sales. \nThis is what is known as a variable cost. \n\n\n10\n\n# of ice cream scoops produced\nCALCULATING VARIABLE COSTS\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nIce cream (1 tub=100 scoops)\nQuantity used\nPrice/Tub\n800\n$2.56\n5\n$4.00\n10\n$1.25\n5\n$1.56\n20\n$3.00\n0.5\n$0.30\n$     -\n100\n$12.00\nTub price\n$24.67\nScoop Price\n$0.25\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY \nFEBRUARY\nBranded T-Shirt\n20\nIce cream scoop\n300\n315\nSweet drink\n300\n315\n(10 minutes: Discussion) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nAsk: What do you guys know about variable costs? Have the class share what they know on the topic.\nPotential answers: \nThere are fixed costs and variable costs. \nFixed costs stay the same month to month. Variable costs change.\nIf you produce more, it costs you more. \n\nAsk: If it costs us $.25 for one scoop of ice cream, and we sell 300 scoops in January, how much are the Ice cream related COGS in January?\nAnswer: $74\nAs we increase our ice cream sales, we also increase the COGS related to ice cream.\nIn the financial model, you should link your sales with COGS to calculate your variable costs.\n\n\nAsk: What other things can be variable in your business?\nPotential answers: \nDelivery of your item (each item sold needs to be delivered- you can link this to sales as in COGS calculation)\nDirect labor for your product/service (if not paid a salary)\nIf you offer something (like a gift) with every purchase\nTransportation\nAdvertising\nEtc…\n\nQuestion that might come up: \nHow do we forecast variable costs that aren’t linked to sales?\nWe will approach variable costs in 2 ways. \nWe will link costs to sales. As sales grow, some of your variable costs grow with them\nFor the items that are variable that we can’t link to sales and easily forecast. We are going to estimate how much we would want to spend on those items. For example, although advertising can be variable (you can spend as much as you want on it), we are going to treat it like a fixed cost and set a budget for ourselves and not spend over that amount. \n\n11\n\nCALCULATING COGS\nTOTAL COGS\nSALE TYPE\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nIce Cream Costs\n74\n78\n82\n86\nT-Shirt Costs\n-\n240\n-\n240\nSweet Drink Costs\n834\n876\n919\n965\nTotal COGS\n$74\n$318\n$82\n$326\n(3 minutes: Lecture + demonstration) – time accounted for on slide 6\n\nCalculating the actual costs shown on P&L:\nNow based on the unit price of an item, and the amount old, you can easily calculate the actual COGS. \nThis is broken down month to month and can also be broken down product to product.\nThe more detailed you are in your work, the more detailed and accurate the results will be.\nThe COGS will generate automatically into your P&L if you don’t add or remove rows. \nIf you add/remove rows, make sure to look at the formulas to ensure they add up correctly.\nThe trainer can show exactly how this works by doing it on the actual Google sheet.\n12\n\nGross Profit = Revenues - COGS\nGROSS PROFIT\n2018A\n2019A\n2020A\n2021E\n2022E\nREVENUES\nSales\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 120,000\n$ 200,000\nServices\n$ 20,000\n$ 40,000\nOther Income\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$ 27,000\n$ 45,000\n$ 80,000\n$ 140,000\n$ 240,000\nCOGS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,400\n$ 8,820\n$ 9,261\n$ 9,724\nGROSS PROFIT\n$ 19,000\n$ 36,000\n$ 71,180\n$ 130,739\n$ 230,276\nEXPENSES\nSG&A\n$ 12,000\n$ 12,600\n$ 13,230\n$ 13,892\n$ 14,586\nSalaries\n$ 15,000\n$ 15,750\n$ 16,538\n$ 17,364\n$ 18,233\nOther expenses\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nTOTAL EXPENSES\n$ 35,000\n$ 36,750\n$ 38,588\n$ 40,517\n$ 42,543\nPROFIT/LOSS\n$ 8,000\n$ 8,250\n$ 41,413\n$ 99,483\n$ 197,457\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nTo place us back onto the P&L, let’s see where we are and what we have done so far.\nGo through the P&L statement up until Gross profit\nWe have talked about our revenues. Here we can see how our different revenue streams are highlighted. \nNext, we want to calculate our COGS. We have just learned how to do that.\nNext, we have gross profit. Gross profit is the money that a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its products, or the costs associated with providing its services. This means your total revenues – COGS.\nQuiz the group and ask something like:\nIf you made $1,000 selling hats and your hats cost you $200 to make and deliver to your customer, what is your gross profit? \nAnswer: $800\n\nAsk: How many of you need to calculate COGS in one way or another?\nSome people might raise their hands, others might not. \nCOGS won’t be relevant for everyone. In reality, your COGS are only one type of expense. In the next slides, we are going to take a look at how to calculate the other parts (which will be relevant for everyone). \n\nRecap: You need to calculate the COGS for your business (if relevant) in order to get an accurate picture of your expenses, you should understand the unit economics of your business. This is how much it costs you to produce 1 unit of whatever it is that you are selling. \n\n\n\n\n13\n\nSALARIES\n10-15 minutes: Brainstorm + discussion\n\n3 minutes: Lecture\nAs you mentioned previously, another cost that we need to consider are staff salaries. Your team is an essential part of your business, but they can often be costly. You need to evaluate who should be on your team, when to hire them, and how much you need to pay them! These are strategic questions because you usually need staff to create and sell your product, but you don’t want to hire unnecessary people. You can use the finance tool to help plan when the best time to hire employees are. \n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\nWe will do an example together on the board and then I will show you how to apply it on your cost assumptions tab of the financial model.\nThe brainstorm/explanation should be done on a whiteboard or Jamboard. \n\nExample:  Calculating salaries\nAsk: What is the best way to approach figuring out our costs related to salaries?\nStep 1: Figure out who you need to hire\nSome things are obvious. You already know who to hire\nLook at your sales forecast. Who do you need to actually reach that target? Don’t hire someone until you need them\nFind interns and students who could volunteer instead of hiring someone\nTake more responsibilities on yourself\nNote to trainer: We will go over hiring in more detail in the LEAD sessions\nStep 2: Estimate their salary\n\nStep 3: Figure out when you want to hire and how many people\n\n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nGo onto the financial model and show how entrepreneurs can apply the brainstorm we just had to their business. \nShare your screen and show how to put the example from the board (that you did as a group) onto the financial model. Use the same example to save time. \nPoints to bring up include:\nAs entrepreneurs are answering that question, show them these parts of the model:\nBlue: The job title of the person you need. \nOrange: The salaries for each person. Make sure you write your own salary as well. Put a number that you actually deserve (what is your worth?)!\nMonth to month in orange: The number of that particular employee you will hire for that given month (for example, 1 CEO, 2 interns, etc…). If your salary is too high, remember you don’t have to pay yourself at the beginning or you can take half of your salary (type in .5 in the month to month box – shown in the first row of the second picture under October and November). \n\n\n\n14\n\nPRACTICE\n\nAdd your employees into your financial model!\n15 minutes: Activity\n\n2 minutes: Explanation\nEntrepreneurs will work on their own model and input information for their salaries. \nWe will not apply the COGS directly because it does not relate to everyone, but this is a good time for them to apply some of the new knowledge onto their business.\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nSet the timer for 8-10 minutes and let entrepreneurs work on their model.\nThe trainer should go around to answer any questions or help when needed. \nTrainers should make sure to point out if they want to hire someone who might not be necessary at this point. You can suggest to hire them maybe in year 2 or 3 (show them on the model how that would work)\n\n\n\nSELLING, \u000bGENERAL, & ADMINISTRATIVE\n15 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nHave a brief discussion on selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&A). These are costs that are not directly related to production or salaries but are essential for business operations.\nOk, so we are clear on COGS and salaries, now what about all of your other costs? Where do they go? \nWe will put all of your other costs (except for startup costs) under SG&A.\nThe SG&A category can encompass all of your other expenses that we haven’t accounted for yet. \nAsk: What are the other expenses that are left that we still need to account for?\nPotential answers can be:\nRent\nOverhead (ongoing expenses of operating your business)\nAdvertising\nSupplies\nLawyer fees\nAccountant\nUtilities\nWorkspace efficiency\nOperational tools to reduce costs over time.\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDemonstrate how the finance tool works:\nCategories: You have already mentioned a few of the categories that can be listed in here. These can be larger categories broken down into specific expenses. For example, you can see that I have advertising listed here. Instead of just saying $160 will be spent on advertising, you want to think about how you will actually advertise. Think about where your customers are and how you can best reach them. In this case I chose Facebook promotions, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and printed materials. You should think of every expense you will need to pay out over the coming years and write it out. \nMonth to month expenses: You can highlight how much you plan on spending every month for each category. Take a look at your sales targets per month and consider how much you would have to spend to get there. Be as realistic as possible. \nFor example, If you spend $100 on a Facebook advertisement, how many views will that generate? How many people typically look at an ad before converting into a sale? If you are only spending a small amount of money on 1 form of advertising, don’t expect a ton of sales! \nYoY growth: The year over year (YoY) growth box allows you to set a standard growth rate for your expenses. You should assume that you will be spending more on expenses every year because of the rise in prices or because you are spending more as you grow. You can choose to use this method or not depending on the situation of that expense item. \n\nQuestions that might come up:\nAre these fixed or variable costs?\nSome of them are fixed and some of them are variable. Things like rent are fixed all the time. Maybe there is a price increase, but for the most part you know that it will be the same month to month.\nFor some of the others such as advertising, meeting expenses, and so on, these are variable, but if you plan ahead and budget for them, you can treat them as a fixed cost. You can say that you will only spend $100 on _____ per month or something like that. Remember that we want to plan as accurately as possible. \n\n.\n16\n\nPROFIT AND LOSS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nYEAR 3\nSALES\nProducts\n26,276\n72,604\n127,752\nSubscriptions\n6,364\n11,428\n20,523\nTOTAL SALES:\n$ 46,965\n$ 84,032\n$ 148,276\nEXPENSES\nCOGS\n17,333\n29,635\n49,097\nSalaries\n19,700\n49,000\n92,400\nSG&A\n8,820\n12,945\n13,166\nTOTAL EXPENSES:\n$45,853\n$91,580\n$154,663\nNET INCOME:\n$2,622\n$7,548\n$6,387\n5 minutes: Demonstration + discussion\n\nStay on the financial model and show the profit and loss summary tab.\nFinally, now that all the costs are accounted for, you can see the completed P&L.\nShow how it is all linked to that one page. \nIf you look at the P&L summary tab, you can see all your information at a very high level. Again, these numbers should automatically generate for you based on the totals generated from your detailed P&L statement (which are generated from your assumptions).

How can you use the information here to be a better manager?\nPotential answers:\nThis tab can be very insightful for you or anyone else evaluating your financials. \nGet a very clear summary of all the details of where you are doing well and where you are suffering. \nYou can see if your costs/revenues are super high or low. \nFor example, salaries are posing a big problem here. They are so expensive and are growing fast!\nYou can easily see if there is an error somewhere on your financials on this page, you know where to go to solve it or fix the formula\nYou can see your growth and profitability over time. Are you being realistic? Are you over or undervaluing yourself? \nWhen you start to really track information, this can be helpful to help you know where to cut costs or be more efficient. \nIf these numbers are interesting enough, an investor might ask how you plan on doing it, which could lead to a longer conversation with them\nAlternatively, an investor might look at them and be turned off right away.\n\n\n17\n\nResource Efficiency ROI Calculator\nInvestment\nInitial Cost\nAnnual Savings\nPayback (months)\n3-Year ROI\nRisk Reduction\nSolar Panels\n$3,000\n$960\n38\n60%\nEnergy price stability\nLED Lighting\n$500\n$240\n25\n144%\nLower maintenance\nWater Systems\n$800\n$300\n32\n113%\nResource security\nAppears on Balance Sheet as: Fixed Assets \u000bReduces Monthly Expenses by: $125 \u000bCustomer Value: Brand differentiation, price stability\n[[[needs facilitator notes]]]\n18\n\nPRACTICE\n\nHow can you make this business more profitable?\n45 minutes: Activity\n\n5 minutes: Explanation\nBreak the room into small groups of 3-5 people\nAllow entrepreneurs to go somewhere comfortable to work as a group\nEvery group will get an example P&L statement to work on as a group (Old, will remove)\nThe P&L statement will not be profitable (Old, will remove)\nEvery group will receive an example Profit & Loss (P&L) statement that is not profitable.\nEach group needs to evaluate the statement and make it profitable.

How are you doing today? \nToday, we will go into our 3rd and final financial modelling session! We will focus on your balance sheet and your start up costs. \nWe will work on your financials together the whole time. Please stop me if you have any questions or more explanation because other people are probably having the same questions.\n\n1\n\nInclude your start-up budget into your financials.\nGet to know the balance sheet and begin making one. \nUnderstand how financials change with investment or loans.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nInclude your start-up budget into your financials.\nGet to know the balance sheet and begin making one.\nUnderstand how financials change with investment or loans.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nProfit and Loss\n  Revenue Model\n  Cost Model\n\nBalance Sheet \n  Assets \n  Liabilities\n  Owner’s Equity\n\n\nFINANCIAL MODELING\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nSo where are we?\nAs you know, during the incubator, we will work on your financial model. This means that you will come out with a forecasted statement of profit and loss and also a balance sheet. We have already started and completed our statement of profit and loss!\nAsk: Can someone give me a brief overview of what it is (profit and loss)? \nPotential answers:\nRecording all the money coming in and going out (revenues- costs)\nCosts include COGS, SG&A, Salaries, etc…\nThey did it over a timespan of 3 years, but they can make it longer if they want.\nEtc…\n\nGreat, now we will work on your balance sheet! This highlights all the things that you have (assets) vs all of the things that you owe (liabilities). This will be forecasted over 3 years as well. \n\nCost of Goods Sold (COGS)\nSalaries\nSelling, General, and Administrative (SG&A)\nStart Up Costs\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX)\nCapital Expenditure (CAP-EX)\nTYPES OF COSTS:\n2 minutes: Transition\n\nThe first step we will take to create your balance sheet is to outline what we have. Because most of us aren’t operating yet, we don’t have anything! Therefore, we are going to take the “what we have” part from our startup budget. We are going to create our balance sheet from the perspective that we get the investment that we need to launch. This means that “what you have” is based off of your startup costs (what they are \"going\" to receive).\nWe have already covered COGS, salaries, and SG&A. The last type of cost we will cover are the startup costs. We will also look at your startup costs and see if they are an operating expense or capital expenditure. We will go into detail of what these things mean later.\n\n4\n\nSTART UP BUDGET\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: We have already talked about how to make a startup budget during Ignite, but can someone just give us a brief recap of what it consists of? \nPotential answers (no need to talk about them all because this was covered already, but make sure they have a good understanding of what to include):\nBusinesses spend money before they open their doors. Start up expenses are those expenses incurred before your business is running, but contribute to the long term success of it.\nYou can include what you are planning to contribute into the business as well through your personal contribution.\nThe different things that you need to include in your start up budget can include:\nDevelopment costs: What you need to actually create and develop your product. This will really depend on what you are making. I listed some examples below, but it can be much more detailed than this.\nApp development\nWebsite development\nDomain and Hosting for 1 year\nInitial research and development\nLogo designer \nOffice, store, center, land rent for 6 months to a year (depending on how long you think it will take before you are profitable) \nFurniture/decoration\nConstruction/repairs/paint\nWebsite\nLogo design\nMachinery or tools\nInitial marketing:\nGrand opening event\nSocial media advertisements (when doing the budget, be specific on which platforms you will use and how much you will spend on each)\nFlyers, brochures, marketing material\nSignage \nInitial working capital: Any additional money you will needed to operate your business for the first 6 months to a year while you are still working to become profitable\nSalaries for the first few months\nOperational needs\nLegal fees:\nRegistration\nLawyer fees\nName registration\nIntellectual property and patents\nMaterials and supplies: \nThe first set of items that you need to sell\nMaterials needed to make the final product\nCleaning supplies\nPaper goods\nConsumables\n5\n\nSTART UP COSTS\nStart Up Costs\nAmount\nNotes\nRent\n$2,000\n4 months\nMarketing and Advertising\n$1,920\nMarketing materials, SEO, social media advertising\nApp Development\n$15,000\nNative android and IOS\nSignage\n$1,500\nOutdoor signage and decoration\nWebsite\n$2,500\nWebsite development\nCompany stamp\n$900\nLegal and Licensing\n$4,000\nLawyer to help register and provide legal services during the first year\nBank account\n$50\nBank fees\nOffice Supplies\n$200\nStaplers, hole punch, binders\nFile Cabinets\n$200\nDesk and Chairs\n$500\nReception and office desks\nComputer\n$1,500\nMac computer\nConsumales\n$500\nPaper, pens, ink catridges, other supplies\nTOTAL START-UP COSTS NEEDED:\n$30,770\nYOUR STARTUP BUDGET\nYEAR 1\nPERSONAL CONTRIBUTION\nPersonal Investment\nAmount\nNotes\nSalary\n$30,000\n$2,500/month for 1 year\nComputer\n$1,000\nTwo 3 year old Lenovo laptops\nFurniture\n$1,000\nLightly used office furniture\nPrinter\n$329\nHP Color Laserjet Pro\nPrinter Ink\n$500\n10 cartridges of ink\nTOTAL\n$32,829\n15 minutes: Demonstration + activity\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nDuring Ignite, we made a simple budget based on what you thought about your business at the time. A lot of this was made simply using assumptions. Now that you are much farther along on your business, I would like you to re-evaluate your budget and make one that reflects the new knowledge you have about your business. If you are still unsure of what you need to start your business, you need to do more research to really understand what this number would look like. \nGo onto the excel sheet and show the entrepreneurs exactly how to use the Startup Costs tab of the excel sheet.\nMake sure to explain the personal contribution! I pulled this out to show everything that the entrepreneur has invested in their own business. They should make sure to show any assets they are contributing because this will show up on their balance sheet. \nAsk: Why do you think that marketing and advertising white?\nLet them share their ideas\nAnswer: That square is white because it is a formula. If you look at where that number came from, it is from your assumptions page on the P&L. It is from the SG&A advertising total from year 1.  If you intend to have someone pay for all or part of your advertising, you need to make sure that this number matches your actual plan.\n\n5 minutes: Activity\nAsk everyone to take out their start up budget. \nTake the next 5 minutes to adjust your startup budget and put it into your financial model. \nJust focus on the columns called “Start-up Costs”, “Amount”, and “Notes”. Ignore the rest for now!\nThink about all of your costs necessary to start your business. \nNote down where you need to gather more information\nDon’t forget to add your personal contribution!\n\n\n\n\n\nCAP-EX OR OP-EX?\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nOperating Expenses (OP-EX): Direct costs involved in day to day operation. These could be fixed or variable. These are operational costs that contribute to your business running normally. You probably have to pay for these things every month or on a frequent basis.\nAsk: Can someone give me a few examples of operational costs?\nPotential answers:\nMarketing and advertisements,\nTravel,\nRent,\nMeetings,\nSupplies, \nSalaries, \netc. \n\nCapital Expenditure: Capital expenditure, or CapEx, are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets. These are one time purchases that relate to the long term business success (items that will last at least 1 year or longer).

These could be fixed or variable. These are operational costs that contribute to your business running normally.

Do remember seeing this on your P&L? We said we would get to it later. Now we are here!\n\nAmortization and depreciation are ways to spread the cost of an asset over the course of its useful life. \nBy doing this, you will have a smaller impact on your P&L. When you buy very expensive assets that aren’t typical in your yearly expenses, you don’t want them to reflect on your P&L. This will give people the wrong idea of what you are spending month to month to operate your business. If it shows up as an expense on your profit and loss, that will look bad for investors or other people interested in your company. You want to minimize the expenses on the P&L to look more profitable.\nStay as accurate as possible to understand month to month or year to year changes. If you have random large expenses in your P&L, you wont get an accurate picture of your normal spending habits. \n\nAmortization is a method of spreading the cost of an intangible asset over a specific period of time, which is usually the course of its useful life. Intangible assets are non-physical assets that are nonetheless essential to a company, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The goal in amortizing an asset is to match the expense of acquiring it with the revenue it generates.\nExample: Let's say a company spends $50,000 to obtain a license, and the license in question will expire in 10 years. Since the license is an intangible asset, it should be amortized for the 10-year period leading up to its expiration date. Using the straight-line method of amortization, which is a method for charging a cost to an expense at a consistent rate over time, the company's annual amortization expense for the license will be $5,000 (that's $50,000/10 years), meaning the asset will decline in value by $5,000 every year.\nDepreciation: Like amortization, depreciation is a method of spreading the cost of an asset over a specified period of time, typically the asset's useful life. The purpose of depreciation is to match the expense of obtaining an asset to the income it helps a company earn. Depreciation is used for tangible assets, which are physical assets such as manufacturing equipment, business vehicles, and computers. Depreciation is a measure of how much of an asset's value has been used up at a given point in time.\nExample: Let's say a company purchases a new piece of equipment with an estimated useful life of 10 years for the price of $100,000. Using the straight-line method, the company's annual depreciation expense for the equipment will be $10,000 ($100,000/10 years). This is important because depreciation expenses are recognized as deductions for tax purposes. It is also possible for a company to use an accelerated depreciation method, where the amount of depreciation it takes each year is higher during the earlier years of an asset's life.\n\nFor the purpose of simplicity, we are going to put everything under depreciation for now, but you can separate them on your financials if you would like to be more detailed. \n10\n\nLIFETIME VALUE OF ASSETS\nTYPE\nAMOUNT\nNOTES\nESTIMATED USEFUL LIFETIME VALUE (IN YEARS)\nINFORMATION USED FOR DEPRECIATION\nYearly value\nMonthly value\nExpense\n$ 2,000\n4 months\n<1 yr\nExpense\n$1,920\nMarketing materials, SEO, social media advertising\n<1 yr\nCapitalize\n$15,000\nNative android and IOS\n8\n$1,875\n$156.3\nCapitalize\n$1,500\nOutdoor signage and decoration\n5\n$300\n$25\nCapitalize\n$2,500\nWebsite development\n5\n$500\n$41.7\nCapitalize\n$900\n5\n$180\n$15\nCapitalize\n$3000\nSolar Panel Installation\n25\n$120\n$10\nINFORMATION USED IN DEPRECIATION\nYearly Depreciation\nMonthly Depreciation\n$3,750.3\n$312.5\n25 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm + demonstration\n\n10 minutes: Lecture + brainstorm\nSo how do we calculate the depreciation? That is easy! \nWe just add 1 more column of information which is “estimated useful lifetime value (in years)\nSo for each of your capitalized expenses, think about how long it will last. Write the number of years in the yellow space. \nSome of these things have international standards (for example, a computer is said to have a useful life of 5 years even though it will still work after that time), but you can always estimate if you don’t know. \nThen you take the value of the item and divide it by the number of years to find its yearly value.\nDo an example on the board!\nAsk: You bought a new computer that you bought for $500. What is the monthly and yearly depreciation value?\nStep 1: determine lifetime value: 5 years\nStep 2: Divide value by the number of useful years: $500/5=$100/year\nStep 3: Divide yearly value by 12 months: $100/12=$8.333\nAsk: What does this mean?\nEvery year, your computer will lose about $100 in value or $8.33 per year.\nThis is shown as an expense on your P&L as $8.33 month to month instead of $500 all at once!\nYou will do this for all of your capitalized assets to show a total yearly and monthly depreciation value (show animation). \n\n5 minutes: Demonstration\nShow how to fill this information on the excel sheet.\nShow where it is all added up\nShow how the depreciation shows up on the P&L by going to row 35 on the Profit and Loss tab. We incur a cost of $313 every month instead of $28,629 all at once from your capitalized expenses. In cell S35, that number changes because you got another investment and increased your assets (shown at the bottom of the startup costs tab). \n\n10 minutes: Activity\nHave the entrepreneurs fill in the information for their business\nSome might be having trouble so go around and help anyone who is struggling.\n\n11\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: Does anyone know what a balance sheet is? How is it different from P&L? What information do you find here that you don’t get on your P&L?\nPotential answers:\nWhat you have vs what you owe: Everything you have was paid by something. Either debt, your personal money, or investment. The document shows how you financed the things your business has. \nA balance sheet is one of the three major business statements.\nIt shows what the business owns, what it owes, and the value of the owner's investment in the business.\nYour balance sheet is a snapshot of your business health. It is evaluated in a single point in time. A P&L is evaluated over time. You watch it change year to year. \nYour balance sheet shows your financial health in a single point of time. You don’t evaluate it over time like a P&L. Instead, you look at your assets and liabilities in a single point in time to understand your net worth. \nMany financial ratios use information in your balance sheet. With these ratios you can get a better idea of your financial health. \n12\n\nSales \nPromotion\nTotal Assets  \nTotal Liabilities  \nTotal owner’s equity\nTotal Assets = Total Liabilities + Total owner’s equity\nPREPARE YOUR BALANCE SHEET\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nIn theory it is a very simple document summed up by a simple formula. The difficult part is creating an accurate representation of each of these categories. \nAs we said before, the balance sheet shows what you have vs what you owe. \nEverything that you own (total assets) need to equal what you owe (total liabilities +owners equity). Everything you own was paid for by something. Either your personal contribution, investment, a loan, or even a gift or grant.\n13\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS\nMore information about the balance sheet with examples. They don’t record all of this on their balance sheet so it can be confusing for entrepreneurs. But it is good to understand all the other parts of a balance sheet for future recording. \n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nAssets are the things that you have. They can be long term or current (short term) assets. These assets contribute to the success of your business and are (hopefully) contributing to your long term growth!\nCurrent assets: This includes cash and things that can easily turn into cash. Things such as inventory can be easily turned into cash by selling the item. These things usually can be converted to cash within the year.\nCash: Cash in the bank is an asset!\nAccounts receivable: The amount of money that people owe you. Maybe you already delivered a product/service but haven’t received payment yet. This should be reported!\nInventory: Do you have a lot of items that are ready to be sold? You can include their value here.\nPrepaid rent: Did you already pay for something and the value of that item is still owed to you? You can also include this. This is the same as prepaid salaries or other non-monetary things owed to you. \nLong term assets: These are assets that have value, but they aren’t very liquid (can’t turn into cash easily). This includes things like machinery, property, technology, and other big investments.\nLand: Property is valuable and should be recorded as something that adds value in your business.\nBuildings & improvements: Not only can you count the physical building, but you can count how much you spent to improve the building. Maybe you build a handicap ramp, or installed walls, even painting the walls count here. They are all investments into your business that will last a long time and increase the value of your assets.\nFurniture & fixtures: These are things that you have invested into your business and should be accounted for.\nGeneral equipment: Machinery and other equipment are valuable parts of your business that help you generate revenues and operate!\n\n14\n\nSales \nPromotion\nLIABILITIES + OWNERS EQUITY\nMore information about the balance sheet with examples. They don’t record all of this on their balance sheet so it can be confusing for entrepreneurs. But it is good to understand all the other parts of a balance sheet for future recording. \n\n5 minutes: Lecture\n\nNow that we have shown exactly what we have, we need to show how we paid for it. You are either paying for your business with money you (and investors) put in in exchange for owners equity, or you take out a loan (debt). Between these two things, it shows exactly how you paid for all of your assets.\n\nWhat you owe:\nCurrent liabilities: These are things that you owe people within the year. If you borrow money from someone and you need to pay it back. Or if you buy something from a business and haven’t paid for it yet (and you owe them the money within the year). \nAccounts payable: This is the opposite of accounts receivable (shown as an asset). If you have received a product or service, but you still owe cash, you would need to show that.  Any time that you owe cash to or services to people, you would put it as a current liability. \nLong term liabilities: This is what you owe that you don’t have to pay back for at least a year. If you take out a loan, it will usually be under here.\nOwners equity: This covers your personal contribution to your business and also investment. It is the owners (including partners) money that they have invested. Additionally, all of the money that your business has generated through sales that you have retained from the previous years would be reported here as well (this will keep your growing cash balanced- How are you getting the increased amount of cash on your assets? Through the retained earnings under owner’s equity- you don’t owe this to anyone except shareholders of your business, including yourself). \n15\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET\nTYPES OF COSTS\nCapitalize\n$28,629\nExpense\n$34,970\nTOTAL COST\n$63,599\nYEAR 1: SUMMARY OF CAPITALIZED COSTS(ASSETS)\nTechnology\n$20,329\nFurniture\n$1,700\nOther\n$-\nTOTAL CAPITALIZED COSTS\n$22,029\nJANUARY\nFEBRUARY\nMARCH\nAPRIL\nAssets\nCash\n$42,352\n$43,702\n$45,204\n$46,784\nTechnology\n$20,329\n$20,329\n$20,329\n$20,329\nFurniture\n$1,700\n$1,700\n$1,700\n$1,700\nOther\nAccumulated Depreciation\n$313\n$625\n$938\n$1,250\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$64,069\n$65,106\n$66,296\n$67,563\n10 minutes: Lecture + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Lecture\nAsk: Where do you think we are going to calculate our assets from?\nAnswer: For simplicity sake, we are not going to break down the assets into all of the subcategories. We are doing a high level version. As you actually track your inventory and other assets over time, you can easily put that information into the balance sheet. We have a simplified balance sheet right now. We are only going to include the assets that you have reported as either your personal contribution or as your startup costs. If you have other assets that you want reported, include them in your personal contribution! You want to show that you are putting skin in the game as well! \nYou can see how we categorized our assets based on the startup costs:\nYour assets can be categorized in many different ways. It depends on your business. It is up to you to make sure the categories are correct. These are categorized by the information in my startup costs. I categorized my capitalized assets into 2 main categories “technology”, “furniture”, and added a third that I didn’t actually use “other”.

What types of business activities would cause changes in this?\nPotential answers: \nIf assets or liabilities change\nYou might lose an asset or it decreases in value over time\nYou might buy a new asset. You would want to show that your business has increased in value. \nYou might also want to show how you paid for that asset (retained earnings, investment, debt, etc..)\n\nFacilitator Note:\n\"Let’s say you decide to invest in solar panels to reduce long-term electricity costs. This would show up as:\nInvestment: $3,000 (Solar Panels) added under Assets → Technology\nDepreciation Impact: $120/year or $10/month added to P&L → Depreciation\nCash Reduction: $3,000 deducted from Cash Reserves unless financed by a grant.\nAsk:\nHow does this change your financial health?\nWould this make your business stronger in the long run?\nPossible Answer:\nEven though cash is reduced in the short term, this investment will lower electricity costs each month, improving the company’s long-term profitability.\n\nRecap: The balance sheet will change as your assets and liabilities change. If you get an investment or take out a loan, that investment would show up in your assets as cash. Also there will be an increase in owners equity (assuming that the investment was for shares/equity) or there will be an increase in your liabilities if you have to pay that money back. \n\nTransition: Now we will take a look to see exactly how it changes.\n21\n\nSales \nPromotion\nBALANCE SHEET BEFORE A LOAN\nASSETS\nLIABILITIES AND OWNER’S EQUITY\nCash $3,000\nCurrent Liabilities $1,000\nInventory $0\nLoan and Long-term Liabilities $0\nPrepaid Salaries $2,500\nFurniture & Fixtures $8,000\nOwner’s Equity $12,500\nTOTAL ASSETS $13,500\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND OWNER'S EQUITY $13,500\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nSo this is a balance sheet before you take out a loan. Your balance sheet might look like this if you don’t win seed funding or get investment. \nIt looks a little different from the one we made, and it is different from others you will see online, but that is normal. This is a very simple version. Financial models will change slightly based on the business; however, the main components stay the same. You can see that we still have assets, liabilities, and owners equity here (which are the main parts of the balance sheet - What you have vs what you owe)\nAsk: So let’s take a look at this balance sheet. What do you see? What do you know about the business?\nPotential answers:\nThis is the money you put in. Maybe you put in $12,500 of your own. And $1000 from maybe a friend or family member. Although we don’t know exactly the details of where this money came from, we know what it means. \nWith that $13,500 (sum of the debt and ownership), you have been able to buy furniture, prepay some salaries, and keep a few thousand dollars as cash just in case. \n\nRecap: Remember, everything needs to be accounted for. All the money in the business is paying for something (it is balanced)\n\n22\n\nSales \nPromotion\nASSETS\nLIABILITIES AND OWNER’S EQUITY\nCash $3,000\nCurrent Liabilities $1,000\nInventory $40,000\nLoan and Long-term Liabilities $50,000\nPrepaid Salaries $2,500\nFurniture & Fixtures $18,000\nOwner’s Equity $12,500\nTOTAL ASSETS $63,500\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND OWNER'S EQUITY $63,500\nBALANCE SHEET AFTER A LOAN\n20 minutes: Discussion + demonstration\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\nNow let’s assume that you win money, get investment, or take out a loan. You will want to show how that cash injection will change your financials. With new cash, your business can now pay for more things. You will want to show what you are buying, and also where that money came from. Let’s look at an example together:\n\nAsk: Can anyone tell me what happened here (in the picture above)?\nAnswers: \nThis business took out a loan for $50,000. This is shown as a long term loan/liability because it will take over a year to pay it back (if you have to pay it back in less than a year it will be a current liability). \nTotal liabilities and owner’s equity raised to $63,500 because it is the total of the new loan + the original loan of $1000 + the $12,500 that you put in at the beginning (you might need to go back to the previous slide to show exactly how the right side of the balance sheet has changed).\nNow you have to do something with that new money which is shown. If you don’t do anything with the money, it will show up in your assets as cash. This means you have money you can use, but you haven’t spent anything.\nBut according to this balance sheet, the business did spend money. They spent $40,000 on inventory and $10,000 on more furniture and fixtures. \nNo matter how you spend that money, your assets will always equal the total liabilities and owner’s equity (because it will be cash or something else). \n\nRecap: What changed?\nLoans and long term liabilities increased by 50k. It went here because it is a loan you will have to pay back. Not equity. It is also long term because it isn’t meant to be paid back in less than a year. That 50k is a long term liability.\nWhere are you spending this money? You paid for inventory and furniture.\nSomeone looking at this would be interested to see how you spend your money. Is it sitting as cash? 50k as cash doesn’t grow for you. People want to see smart investments with the money. \n\nAnother example:\nAsk: You just saw an example of a loan, but what would it look like if you got investment? How would your balance sheet change?\nAnswers:\nThe amount of investment will be shown in owners equity. It is not a loan and it is not expected to be paid back.\nThe amount of investment would show up as an asset in some form (cash or another asset).\n\n10 minutes: Demonstration\nThis demonstration might be too complex to go over in class (considering all of the other work they have done so far). As it is not relevant for everyone, consider leaving the conversation high level if the class is having a hard time. You can go over this during advisory sessions for those interested.\nIf they are ready to go into another demonstration show the following points:\nShare your screen and go onto the financial model. Show how the balance sheet changes when you get a loan or investment.\nShow them how an investment would show up on their financial model. \nWhat are you buying: If you are capitalizing anything from this investment, you should show it on your balance sheet as an asset. Balance sheet rows 7-10 show the breakdown of how you are spending that investment.\n\nHow you are paying for the investment: \nIf equity investment: Owners equity on the balance sheet should show the past capital that was invested into the business + the new capital invested in business. The time of the change in owners equity will show the time of the new investment. \nIf loan: Long term debt on the balance sheet will show how much you borrowed and at what time. \nIt will also make a small impact on the P&L (depreciation and amortization will increase to reflect new assets)\n23\n\nON YOUR FINANCIALS\nYEAR 1\nYEAR 2\nNovember\nDecember\nJanuary\nFebruary\nEquity\nCapital\n$63,599\n$63,599\n$93,599\n93,599\nRetained earnings\n-\n-\n8,352\n8,352\nNet Income\n$ 7,400\n$8,352\n$7,235\n6,996\nTotal equity\n$ 70,999\n$71,951\n109,185\n108,946\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY\n$70,999\n$71,951\n109,185\n108,946\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nYou can see a change here in capital from year 1 to year 2 (from 63,599 to 93,599). \nAsk: What might have happened here?\nMore cash went into your business.

      "content": " # Strategic Efficiency Investments & Resource Efficiency ROI Slides for Balance Sheet Module\n\nBased on my review of the Balance Sheet module, here are the optimized slides with facilitator notes that align with the content before and after their placement.\n\n## Slide 1: Strategic Efficiency Investments\n\n**Placement**: This slide should be placed after slide 7 (\"CAP-EX OR OP-EX?\") and before slide 8 (\"HOW SHOULD WE CATEGORIZE THESE?\"). This works well because it follows the definition of capital expenditures and provides concrete examples of efficiency investments as a specific type of CapEx.\n\n**Slide Content:**\n```markdown\n# Strategic Efficiency Investments\n\n| Investment | Initial Cost | Annual Savings | Payback Period |\n|------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Solar Panels | $3,000 | $960 | 3.1 years |\n| LED Lighting | $500 | $240 | 2.1 years |\n| Water Systems | $800 | $300 | 2.7 years |\n\n## Financial Benefits:\n- Appears on Balance Sheet as: Fixed Asset\n- Reduces monthly operating costs by: $125\n- Improves brand perception with customers\n\n## Business Resilience Benefits:\n- Protects against rising utility costs\n- Reduces dependency on external resources\n- Creates more stable monthly expenses\n```\n\n**Facilitator Notes:**\n```\nFACILITATOR NOTES: STRATEGIC EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS\n\nPURPOSE: This slide introduces efficiency investments as a strategic category of capital expenditures that generate ongoing financial benefits.\n\nPRESENTATION (5 minutes):\n1. Link to previous slide: \"We just discussed the difference between operating expenses and capital expenditures. Now let's look at a specific type of capital expenditure that can actually reduce your operating expenses over time.\"\n\n2. Walk through each example:\n   - \"A solar panel installation costs $3,000 upfront, but saves $80/month in electricity. Over its 25-year lifespan, it will generate $24,000 in savings.\"\n   - \"LED lighting has a faster payback period of just over 2 years, then continues saving money for 3+ more years.\"\n   - \"Water-saving systems can both reduce utility bills and protect against water shortages.\"\n\n3. Emphasize the dual benefits:\n   - \"These investments appear on your balance sheet exactly like any other fixed asset.\"\n   - \"But unlike many other assets, they actively reduce your monthly expenses.\"\n   - \"This means they directly improve your profitability after the payback period.\"\n\nDISCUSSION PROMPT (3 minutes):\n- \"What utility expenses in your business consistently increase year after year?\"\n- \"Are there any efficiency investments that would make sense for your specific business model?\"\n\nTRANSITION TO NEXT SLIDE:\n\"Now let's continue with categorizing your startup costs as either expenses or assets that you'll capitalize.\"\n```\n\n## Slide 2: Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator\n\n**Placement**: This slide should appear after slide 17 (\"OWNER EQUITY ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET\") and before slide 19 (\"RESOURCE EFFICIENCY ROI\"). This works well because it shows how efficiency investments impact the balance sheet and provides a practical tool for evaluating these investments.\n\n**Slide Content:**\n```markdown\n# Resource Efficiency ROI Calculator\n\n| Investment | Initial Cost | Annual Savings | Payback (months) | 3-Year ROI | Risk Reduction |\n|------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|------------|----------------|\n| Solar Panels | $3,000 | $960 | 38 | 60% | Energy price stability |\n| LED Lighting | $500 | $240 | 25 | 144% | Lower maintenance |\n| Water Systems | $800 | $300 | 32 | 113% | Resource security |\n\n## Balance Sheet Impact:\n- Appears as Fixed Assets under Technology or Equipment\n- Depreciated over useful life (5-25 years)\n- Reduces monthly expenses in SG&A section of P&L\n\n## Implementation:\n- Add to Capex tab with appropriate useful life\n- Monthly savings automatically reduce operating expenses\n```\n\n**Facilitator Notes:**\n```\nFACILITATOR NOTES: RESOURCE EFFICIENCY ROI CALCULATOR\n\nPURPOSE: This slide demonstrates how to evaluate efficiency investments as strategic business decisions that appear on the balance sheet while improving the P&L.\n\nPRESENTATION (5 minutes):\n1. Connect to owner's equity: \"We just discussed how owner's equity tracks the capital and retained earnings in your business. Strategic investments in efficiency can help increase those retained earnings over time.\"\n\n2. Walk through the ROI calculation:\n   - \"Payback period = Initial Cost ÷ Annual Savings × 12 months\"\n   - \"3-Year ROI = (3-year savings - Initial Cost) ÷ Initial Cost × 100%\"\n   - \"For example, LED lighting has a 144% ROI over 3 years, meaning you get your money back plus 1.44 times more.\"\n\n3. Highlight the balance sheet impact:\n   - \"These investments appear on your balance sheet under Fixed Assets, just like we saw earlier.\"\n   - \"They're depreciated over their useful life, just like any other capital expenditure.\"\n   - \"But they also directly reduce your monthly expenses in the P&L, improving your bottom line.\"\n\nCONNECTING TO THE FINANCIAL MODEL (2 minutes):\n- \"In your Capex tab, you would add these investments with their appropriate useful life.\"\n- \"The depreciation would flow to your Income Statement as a standard expense.\"\n- \"The monthly savings would reduce your utility or operational expenses in the SG&A section.\"\n\nDISCUSSION PROMPT (3 minutes):\n- \"Looking at your specific business model, which efficiency investments might have the fastest payback period?\"\n- \"How would these investments strengthen your business during challenging economic times?\"\n\nTRANSITION TO NEXT SLIDE:\n\"Now let's look at how these efficiency investments would actually impact your ROI over time.\"\n```\n\nThese slides and facilitator notes align perfectly with the existing content in the Balance Sheet module. The first slide builds on the explanation of capital expenditures, while the second slide builds on the discussion of assets and owners equity, showing how strategic investments can appear on the balance sheet while improving financial performance.\n\nBoth slides incorporate the practical aspects of the financial model and help entrepreneurs understand how to implement these concepts in their own business planning.",
