  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user identified themselves as a professional pedagogical designer and consultant for education working with the International Trade Center in Mosul, Iraq. They requested a comprehensive review of their Module 3 training materials for a Green Architecture & Heritage-Inspired Design course, specifically asking for identification of 5 pros and 5 cons, plus 5 improvements. Additionally, they wanted Claude to extract facilitation and training ideas from interview data and compare these against their current module structure.\n\nClaude analyzed the 5-day training module, which follows a consistent \"Learn → Apply → Sell\" three-block daily structure. The analysis revealed strengths including strong cultural localization with Mosul-specific examples and IQD pricing, hands-on learning approaches using tools like IR guns and material samples, and progressive skill building from basic concepts to digital tools. Identified weaknesses included time pressure with 25-minute station rotations, heavy technology dependency on software like Rhino/Ladybug without adequate backup plans, and overly prescriptive facilitation scripts that limit flexibility.\n\nThe proposed improvements focused on adding buffer time for technical troubleshooting, creating analog backup activities for digital components, implementing peer teaching opportunities, moving reflection activities to morning sessions when participants are more alert, and developing more flexible facilitation guides. However, the interview analysis portion could not be completed as the provided Excel file appeared to be empty, preventing extraction of specific participant feedback and suggestions. Claude noted that completing the requested comparison table would require access to the actual interview transcripts, interviewee names, and their specific training method suggestions.",

Welcome to Module 3, Day 1: Green Architecture & Heritage-Inspired Design.”\n[0:20]\u000b Introduce yourself with your 1-liner:\u000b “My name is [Your Name], and I help families sleep upstairs again.”\u000b (Pause)\n[0:40]\u000b Explain the Flash-Round:\u000b “Now let’s learn names and reasons we’re here. We’ll do a quick ‘Who I help … & why’ round. Please stand in a circle.”\n[1:00]\u000b Model the first turn:\u000b “I’ll start. Pop! I’m [Your Name]—I help families sleep upstairs again, by designing homes that stay cool without noisy generators.”\u000b (Ring the little bell.)\n[1:20]\u000b Run the Flash-Round:\u000b “When you hear the bell, it’s time to pass it. You’ll have 12 seconds each—just enough time for your name and one short phrase: who you help and why.”\n[1:40]\u000b Prompt and manage time:\u000b “Ready? Here we go—Pop! [Point to someone next to you].”\u000b (Ring bell at 12 s intervals, gently encourage brevity: “Great, thank you—next!”)\n[3:30]\u000b After 8–10 participants, close:\u000b “Fantastic—thank you all! Now we know who we’re designing for and why. Let’s move on to today’s journey.”\n(Proceed to next slide.)\n\nMosul’s Double-Pain\n*Wet Walls in Winter (mould)” photo\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n[0:00]\u000b “Now let’s ground ourselves in Mosul’s realities—our double-pain seasons.”\n[0:10]\u000b Point to left image (summer heat):\u000b “Last July, temperatures topped 49 °C—homes become ovens. How do you imagine sleeping through that?”\n[0:30]\u000b Point to right image (winter damp):\u000b “Then in winter, we battle humid walls and mould that eats paint and memories. It’s a different kind of cold misery.”\n[0:45]\u000b Engage the group:\u000b “Turn to your neighbor and share in one word: ‘What does this feel like?’”\u000b (Pause 30 s for pair-share; invite 2–3 quick responses.)\n[1:15]\u000b Bridge to safety and homework:\u000b “Tomorrow evening, you’ll photograph your own roof for our shading study—remember our ladder rule. Tonight: climb safely at a 4:1 ratio and keep both hands free.”\n[1:30]\u000b “Great—let’s see how heritage-inspired design can ease both these pains.”\n(Proceed to next slide.)\n\n3 Micro-Stories: Real Impact from Mosul\nWifaq: 17 °C of Comfort\nFatima: Bridge of Renewal\nLaith: Building Trust, One Referral at a Time\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n“Now let me share three real-life examples of how heritage-inspired design is changing lives in Mosul.\nFirst, Over the last year, Fatima co-founded a grassroots heritage foundation after completing ICCROM’s Mosul training. With just two heritage grants, she and her team restored two of the four historic qunatra (“bridges”) spanning the Old City—reviving not only stone arches but community pride. Their success against funding hurdles shows how local action can rebuild both fabric and future\nNext, My friend Wifaq is a civil engineer who applied a heritage-inspired cork render to a family home. He measured a 17 °C drop in indoor temperature—enough that his children stopped sleeping on the hot roof and finally slept comfortably upstairs. This simple intervention cut heat-pain and saved generator fuel\nFinally, Architect Laith always says, ‘Trust is our currency in Mosul.’ He’s seen firsthand that delivering just one exceptional heritage retrofit earns ten new referrals—so every design balances technical rigor with genuine empathy for family needs\nBy the end of this week, you’ll have the tools to slash heat, boost comfort, and build trust—just like these three change-makers.”\n\nVisual-Nutrition Wall\n*A 3×4 grid of high-quality thumbnail images (200×150 px each), half showing successful heritage-inspired designs (courtyards, mashrabiya screens, natural materials) and half showing modern architectural mis-steps in Iraq (unshaded glass façades, poorly insulated walls, water-damaged plaster).\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n[00:00–00:30] PURPOSE & CONTEXT\u000b “We call this our Visual-Nutrition Wall because like healthy food, your design diet matters. These twelve images are bite-sized case studies—six heritage-inspired wins and six modern fails. Today, you’ll taste-test them visually and help us prioritize what to emulate and what to avoid.”\n[00:30–00:45] INSTRUCTIONS\u000b “Each of you has five dot stickers. Walk up, inspect the grid, and place your dots according to the legend:\u000b 🟢 on images you believe are smart, scalable solutions for Mosul’s climate and culture\u000b 🔴 on images you judge wasteful or harmful in our context.”\n[00:45–01:30] GUIDANCE & FOCUS\u000b “Use all five—this forces you to think critically: which ideas are truly top-priority? Spend no more than 30 seconds per image. As you stick your dots, ask yourself:\nDoes this respect Mosul’s climate and heritage?\nWill this idea actually cut heat or prevent moisture damage?\nCan I explain why it’s smart or wasteful in a single sentence?”\n[01:30–02:00] TRANSITION\u000b “When everyone’s placed their dots, we’ll tally the high-vote images and spotlight the top three “smart” solutions and top three “wasteful” traps. Let’s begin!”\n\nReality-Check Quiz\nScan QR here\nDay 1\nStatements (numbered):\nA courtyard of the right size can cut indoor temperature by ≥ 4 °C\nBig glass façades always improve summer comfort\nRunning a diesel generator costs < 150 IQD/kWh\nDiesel use in homes drops automatically during winter\nFacilitator notes:\nSetup (30 s)\nDisplay the slide and ensure the QR code is clear.\nTell participants:\u000b “We’re going to test some common assumptions about passive cooling and generator costs. Grab your phone and scan the QR code now. You’ll see four True/False statements—just tap your answer!”\nPolling (3 min)\nAs they vote, walk around and ensure everyone’s participating.\nPrompt quietly: “Notice how the courtyard one relates back to our stack-vent demo. Think about that.”\nReveal & Discuss (2 min)\nWhen results appear, pause the poll and display the live bar chart.\nRead off the percentages for each statement:\u000b “73 % said ‘Big glass = comfort’—interesting, right?”\u000b “Only 40 % believed generator costs < 150 IQD/kWh—let’s dive into the math tomorrow.”\u000b\nCapture Myths (1 min)\nOn a flip-chart titled “Day 2 Myth-Buster”, write down any statement where > 50 % of the room voted incorrectly.\nSay:\u000b “Great input—these top misconceptions are our ‘myths’ to bust on Day 2. We’ll come back to each with data and hands-on tests.”\nTransition\n“Next up, we’ll move into our Learn block on courtyards vs. glazing—putting those quiz results to the test.”\n\n\nDaily Agenda \n(3-Block Rhythm)\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nBefore we dive into today’s content, I want to show you the heartbeat of our entire training: the 3-Block Rhythm.\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.\n“In this block, feel free to ask questions—that’s exactly what it’s for.”\u000b\n🛠️ APPLY (Second Block)\nWhat it is: Hands-on practice. You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action? Let’s switch to learning objective day 1”\n\nDay 1 Learning Objectives\nUnderstanding Problems, Empathy & Heritage Solutions\nMaterial Systems & Thermal Envelope\nCourtyards, Privacy & Passive Cooling\nClient Psychology & Market Positioning\nDigital Tools & Performance Modelling\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nThese five objectives will guide our journey today—each one building toward your ability to design heritage-inspired, climate-responsive architecture in Mosul.\n1. Courtyards, Privacy & Passive Cooling\nLearn: You’ll discover how traditional courtyard layouts create privacy and harness stack-ventilation to shave off several degrees of indoor heat.\nWhy it matters: Mastering this gives you a low-tech, high-impact tool to improve comfort without mechanical systems.\n2. Understanding Problems, Empathy & Heritage Solutions\nLearn & Apply: By mapping real family pain points—like roasting upper floors in summer or damp walls in winter—you’ll connect emotionally and uncover heritage tricks that actually work today.\nWhy it matters: Empathy drives better design and stronger client trust.\n3. Material Systems & Thermal Envelope\nLearn: We’ll compare reflective coatings, insulation “sandwiches,” and thermal-mass walls to see which combination best seals out heat and moisture.\nWhy it matters: A well-tuned envelope is your first line of defense against Mosul’s extremes.\n4. Digital Tools & Performance Modelling\nLearn & Apply: You’ll get a sneak-peek at Rhino+Ladybug to generate before/after heat-maps and cooling-load simulations—visual proof that your heritage methods deliver.\nWhy it matters: Data-driven visuals make your design claims undeniable.\n5. Client Psychology & Market Positioning\nApply & Sell: Finally, you’ll package your solutions with empathy-driven messaging—balancing prestige, comfort, and ROI—to position yourself as Mosul’s go-to “heritage cool” expert.\nWhy it matters: Technical skill wins the bid; storytelling and positioning win the client.\u000b\nFeel free to refer back to these objectives throughout the day. They’ll anchor our Learn→Apply→Sell rhythm and keep us focused on delivering both comfort and cultural integrity.”\n\nSafety First – Ladder Rule (4 : 1)\n“Always climb with two hands on.”\n“Keep your phone in your pocket.”\n“Wear a hi-vis vest when on site.”\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nIntro & Purpose (15 s):\u000b “Before we dive into passive cooling, let’s pause for a quick safety moment. Today—and every time you’re on a roof—you must follow our 4 : 1 ladder rule.”\u000b\nDemonstration Setup (10 s):\u000b “I need a volunteer to help me out.”\u000b – Hand the volunteer the hi-vis vest.\u000b – Ensure they put it on.\u000b\nLadder Drill (45 s):\nPlace the ladder so the base is 1 m from the wall and the top reaches 4 m high (or use the 4 : 1 ratio marker on the ladder).\nAsk the volunteer to climb up without using both hands (they may instinctively grab their phone) → gently correct them: “Two hands on.”\nHave them stow their phone before climbing again.\u000b\n“Notice how much more stable and confident that feels. Two hands on, phone in pocket.”\u000b\nVest & Visibility (10 s):\u000b “The hi-vis vest ensures everyone knows exactly where you are on site—no surprises when you’re up on a roof.”\u000b\nConnect to Homework (10 s):\u000b “Tonight, you’ll safely climb—or set up—your own ladder to photograph your rooftop. You’ll use that photo in our Day 2 shading analysis. Remember: two hands on, phone in pocket, vest on!”\u000b\nTransition to Next Segment:\u000b “With safety locked in, let’s move to our first Learn block: experiencing passive stack-ventilation with our incense shoebox demo.”\n\nLearn\nDay 1\n\nMosul Heat & Heritage Logic\nWhy upper floors become ovens?\n☀️ Solar Gain on Roof\n🏠 Poor Roof Insulation\n🌬️ Lack of Stack-Vent Cooling\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n[0:00–0:10] Hook\u000b “Let’s start with a question: why do you think the top floor of a Mosul house can feel like an oven in July? Think about what’s happening on that roof.”\u000b (Pause 2 seconds.)\n[0:10–0:40] Explain Solar Gain\u000b “First, the sun. Here in Mosul we get over 3,000 full-sun hours per year. That intense sunlight beats down on a flat roof all day, turning concrete or metal into a giant heat collector.”\u000b (Point to the yellow arrows in the diagram.)\n[0:40–1:10] Roof Insulation Impact\u000b “Next, most traditional roofs have poor insulation—often just bare concrete or ceramic tile. So once the roof surface heats up, that heat conducts straight through into the living space below.”\u000b (Point to the thick black roof layer in the drawing, then the red glow on second floor.)\n[1:10–1:40] Stack-Vent Missing\u000b “Finally, notice there’s no natural ‘stack-vent’ path. Warm air inside has nowhere to escape—so it pools on the upper level, making it unbearably hot at night.”\u000b (Sweep hand upward along the diagram, show lack of ventilation arrows.)\n[1:40–1:55] Generator Cost Tease\u000b “We know this heat drives many families back onto noisy, fuel-hungry generators. Quick guess: how much might a family pay each month just running a generator to cool one room? Shout out your numbers!”\u000b (Field 2–3 responses.)\n[1:55–2:00] Transition\u000b “Great guesses. We’ll do the exact math in a moment on the whiteboard—but first, let’s see how heritage courtyards used passive cooling to solve exactly this problem.”\n\nPassive Stack-Vent Cooling\nKey Points:\n\n🔥 Incense “heat source” at bottom\n🌫️ Smoke → warm-air path upward\n🌬️ Fresh air drawn through low openings\n*Photo or schematic of a simple shoebox “tower” with incense inside, arrows showing smoke rising and fresh air drawn in at the base\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n[0:00–0:10] Intro to Demo\u000b “Let’s see passive cooling in action—no fans, no power, just smart design.”\n[0:10–0:40] Setup & Observation\u000b “Here’s our mock-up: a shoebox tower with a tiny hole at the base and an open top. Inside, we light an incense stick—this stands in for the sun-heated air near a courtyard floor.”\u000b (Point to the incense graphic.)\u000b “As the incense smoke warms, it naturally rises up the chimney.”\n[0:40–1:10] Airflow Explanation\u000b “Watch closely: as smoke moves upward, it pulls cooler air in through the lower opening. That continuous exchange both ventilates and cools the interior—exactly how heritage courtyards kept houses comfortable in summer.”\n[1:10–1:30] Link to Mosul Context\u000b “In Mosul’s fierce heat, this stack effect could drop indoor temperatures by several degrees—no electricity required. Tomorrow, we’ll model this digitally in Ladybug to quantify exactly how much cooling you can expect.”\n[1:30–1:40] Transition\u000b “But first, let’s switch to our whiteboard and translate these comfort gains into real money: how much does Mosul’s summer heat cost you in generator fuel?”\n\nConverting Heat Relief into IQD\nExample:\n12,000×15=180,000 IQD/month\n“Most households spend 600k–1M IQD/mo on cooling fuel.”\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n[0:00–0:10] Frame the Problem\u000b “Every breeze we save with passive cooling translates into less generator run-time—and big IQD savings.”\n[0:10–0:40] Walk Through Formula\u000b “Here’s our basic math: local generators rent or run at about 12,000 IQD for each amp per month. If your cooling load draws 15 amps, that’s 12,000 times 15…”\u000b (Point to each term in the formula.)\u000b “…for a total of 180,000 IQD per month.”\n[0:40–1:00] Reality Check\u000b “In practice, families powering multiple rooms often hit 600,000 to over a million IQD monthly just on fuel. That’s why reducing even a few amps with passive design immediately pays off.”\n[1:00–1:20] Engage the Group\u000b “Quick show of hands: who guessed more than 180,000 IQD? Who guessed less? Great—this shows how big the stakes are.”\n[1:20–1:30] Transition to Next Topic\u000b “Now that we’ve seen the cash impact, let’s explore how heritage courtyards and modern materials can slash that generator bill—and keep your rooftop photo homework safely taken tonight.”\n\nRhino & Ladybug Teaser\n*Full-screen screenshot of the Mosul house massing in Rhino, with the courtyard void highlighted.\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nLet’s look at our 3D model of a traditional Mosul home in Rhino. On the right you see the solid roof; on the left, the inset courtyard. In Rhino, a single click toggles that courtyard on or off.\nOn Day 4 you’ll each open this file, flip the courtyard in Ladybug, and watch how daylight and airflow patterns change—no coding required\n\nRhino & Ladybug Teaser\n*Left Panel (“Courtyard OFF”): Heat-map overlay on the 3D roof model showing high surface temperatures in reds and oranges.\n*Right Panel (“Courtyard ON”): Heat-map overlay with more yellows and blues indicating cooler surfaces.\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n“Here’s the output from Ladybug’s solar-radiation and surface-temperature analysis.\nLeft map shows the roof as a continuous slab—no courtyard. The reds and oranges tell us surface temperatures peaking highest here.\nRight map, with the inset courtyard, shifts the palette toward blues and greens—on average about 3 degrees Celsius cooler across the deck.\u000b\nWhy this matters: A 3 °C drop at the surface can translate into several degrees less interior heat gain—reducing both daytime discomfort and your AC run-time (and thus your generator or electricity cost).\nTomorrow in Day 4’s Learn block, you’ll each load this exact Rhino model into Ladybug yourselves—toggle the courtyard on/off, run the simulation, and see these numbers live. No coding needed; just point-and-click to generate your own “after” heat-maps.”\n\nApply\nDay 1\n\nRotation setup\nRotation Timing\nSpend 25 minutes at each station.\nWhistle signals rotation.\nLast 5 minutes: teams complete their Empathy Map (Feel/See/Pain/Gain).\nStation Name\nKey Task\nOutput\n🔥 Thermal Proof\nUse IR gun to capture surface temps on 3 walls + roof\n3 annotated photos (TeamX_Thermal1.jpg, …)\n📸 Empathy Gallery\nPin your photos on the “Visual-Nutrition Wall” and tag each with one insight (smart/wasteful)\n3 tagged photos on wall\n✏️ Lot Trace\nOn A3 paper, trace Ahmed’s 150 m² lot and quickly zone major functions (living, kitchen, courtyard)\n1 A3 sketch with color-coded zones\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n“Alright everyone, welcome to our Apply block. You’ll rotate through three hands-on stations—each builds a critical piece of our design story.\n1. Thermal Proof: Grab your IR gun and take temperature snapshots of three different external walls and the roof. Save each photo on your phone as TeamX_Thermal1.jpg, TeamX_Thermal2.jpg, etc., and upload them to the shared folder later.\n2. Empathy Gallery: Pin those photos on the Visual-Nutrition Wall. Use your sticky-dots and legend (🟢 Smart / 🔴 Wasteful) to tag one key insight per photo. For example, “Good overhang here” or “Too much glass → heat gain.”\n3. Lot Trace: On the provided A3 sheet, trace the outline of Ahmed’s 150 m² lot and sketch quick zoning: where living spaces, service areas, and the courtyard might go. Use colored pencils to highlight each zone.\nYou have 25 minutes per station. I’ll use the whistle to signal when to move on. In the final 5 minutes of this rotation, work together to fill out your Empathy Map—capture what your family ‘sees’, ‘feels’, their main ‘pains’, and what they ‘gain’.\nA few tips:\nStart your phone timer as soon as you arrive at a station.\nLabel your files clearly so we can match photos to teams.\nAt each rotation, quickly review previous outputs to build continuity.\u000b\nLet’s start at Thermal Proof—please move to your first station now!”\n\nEmpathy Mapping\nFill in each quadrant based on your station findings:\nFEEL\nSEE\n(Emotional responses: e.g., “Overwhelmed by heat”)\n(Visual observations: e.g., “South wall temps > 55 °C”)\nPAIN\nGAIN\n(Key frustrations: e.g., “High generator bills”)\n(Desired outcomes: e.g., “Cool home without diesel”)\nDay 1\nInstructions:\nGather insights from Thermal Proof, Empathy Gallery, and Lot Trace.\nWrite one bullet per box—keep it concise.\nUse different colored pens for clarity.\nWhen time’s up, hand in your map for our lunchtime debrief.\nFacilitator notes:\n“Now that you’ve gathered thermal data, tagged smart versus wasteful photos, and sketched Ahmed’s lot, it’s time to step into his shoes.\nWe have 10 minutes to complete this Empathy Map for the Ahmed family. Work as a team to fill in:\nFEEL: What emotions are they experiencing? List feelings like ‘stressed by noise’, ‘tired from sleeping on the roof’, or ‘hopeful about new materials’.\nSEE: What do they observe in their home environment? Note visual cues such as ‘dust accumulating on walls’, ‘no courtyard shading’, or ‘generator fumes’.\nPAIN: What specific problems keep them up at night? This might be ‘monthly 800 k IQD generator cost’, ‘mold in winter’, or ‘unsafe wiring’.\nGAIN: What are their dreams and aspirations? Think ‘quiet, cool sleeping upstairs’, ‘lower energy bills’, or ‘pride in a modern-heritage design’.\u000b\nUse the colored markers provided to make each quadrant clear. Every bullet should be short—just a few words.\nCollect your maps at the end of this session; these will feed directly into our lunchtime business lab where we translate Ahmed’s pains and gains into a BOQ and ROI sheet.\nReady?

I’ve organized these four tasks from easiest to hardest, so you can jump in right away and build momentum.\n1. Heat-Pain Photos (📸)\u000b – What: Take three photos of the hottest-looking surfaces—rooftops, north-facing walls, or anywhere the sun beats down.\u000b – Why: We’ll compare these in tomorrow’s Thermal Proof station to see real temperature differences.\u000b – Tip: Use your phone’s temperature or IR-camera app if you have it, but a plain photo works too.\n2. Generator Bill (🧾)\u000b – What: Find your most recent generator fuel receipt or bill and photograph it.\u000b – Why: This gives us the real “pain number” for cost comparisons in our ROI models.\u000b – Tip: If you don’t have a bill, estimate the monthly IQD you spend and note that clearly.\n3. Hook Text Draft (🎥)\u000b – What: Write a single, punchy sentence that captures the customer’s pain and hints at your solution.\u000b – Why: This will be the first 20 seconds of your video tomorrow—your “ice-breaker” to grab attention.\u000b – Tip: Use language we practiced today: e.g., “Tired of paying 1.2 million IQD for a roasting rooftop?”\n4. Dream Firm List (🏢)\u000b – What: List three architecture or design firms you admire for their green or heritage work.\u000b – Why: These serve as inspiration for your own design concepts and tomorrow’s “Design Inspiration” discussion.\u000b – Tip: Mix local favorites with international examples to broaden your perspective.\nLogistics:\u000b – Please upload your photos and hook draft to our WhatsApp group by 9 PM.\u000b – Bring any paper notes or printouts with you in the morning.\nWhy It Matters:\u000b – These tasks feed directly into our Day 2 Apply and Sell blocks. Real photos become data points; real bills drive realistic ROI; your hook powers tomorrow’s video; and your dream-firm list fuels creative designs.\n“That’s it—start with the photos, then the bill, then your text, and finally your firm list.

This exercise reminds us that just as our bodies must align to the sun, our courtyard designs must align to capture or block solar angles. Let’s carry that into our Learn block on stack-vent cooling.”\n\nDaily Agenda \n(3-Block Rhythm)\nDay 2\nFacilitator notes:\nBefore we dive into today’s content, I want to show you the heartbeat of our entire training: the 3-Block Rhythm.\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.\n“In this block, feel free to ask questions—that’s exactly what it’s for.”\u000b\n🛠️ APPLY (Second Block)\nWhat it is: Hands-on practice. You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action? Let’s switch to learning objective day 3”\n\n\nDay 2 Learning Objectives\nSize a 3 × 3 m courtyard for stack-vent+daylight (≥ 4 °C predicted drop)\nCompare glazing ratios (25 % vs 50 %) → energy penalties & shading fixes\nCalculate privacy sight-lines & gender-comfort factors\nPrice incremental courtyard retrofits & compute 2-3 yr ROI\nBuild desk-fan mock-ups to visualise airflow\nDay 2\nFacilitator notes:\n“These five objectives form the roadmap for Day 2, guiding us from analysis to hands-on design and finally to market-ready pitches. Keep these in mind as we move through each block—Learn → Apply → Sell.”\nCalculate privacy sight-lines & gender-comfort factors\nLearn: You’ll use simple geometry and cultural guidelines to map lines of sight through a courtyard.\nWhy it matters: Ensuring women’s privacy in Mosul’s social context isn’t optional—it’s a core requirement that makes your design both respectful and functional.\u000b\nSize a 3 × 3 m courtyard for stack-vent + daylight (≥ 4 °C predicted drop)\nLearn & Apply: You’ll derive the minimum courtyard dimensions needed to create natural chimney-effect ventilation and let in just enough daylight.\nWhy it matters: A correctly sized void can cool interior spaces by at least 4 °C without fans or AC—real comfort powered by passive design.\u000b\nCompare glazing ratios (25 % vs 50 %) → energy penalties & shading fixes\nLearn: We’ll quantify how larger window-to-wall areas increase solar gain and interior overheating.\nWhy it matters: Balancing daylight, views, and cooling loads is essential—too much glass and your clients end up paying to run mechanical cooling all day.\u000b\nBuild desk-fan mock-ups to visualize airflow\nApply: Working in small teams, you’ll construct low-tech wind-tunnel models using cardboard, incense, and small fans.\nWhy it matters: Seeing smoke trails and feeling breeze patterns on your skin cements the stack-vent principles far better than charts ever could.\u000b\nPrice incremental courtyard retrofits & compute 2–3 yr ROI\nApply & Sell: You’ll draft a streamlined BOQ for adding or modifying a courtyard, estimate costs, and calculate payback within 2–3 years.\nWhy it matters: Clients need both comfort and a clear financial case. Showing a rapid ROI on a passive upgrade is your strongest sales argument.\n“Whenever you feel lost, revisit these objectives. They’ll anchor our work, ensure we’re solving real problems, and prepare you to pitch culturally sensitive, climate-smart designs with confidence.”\n\nLearn\n\nMyth\nDay 1 Votes\n“Still True?”\n1.

Studies show that greenery can boost indoor air quality by about 25 %, trapping dust and pollutants before they enter living spaces.”\n2. Shade\u000b “Traditional mashrabiya or latticework filter harsh sun but invite dappled light. This shade alone reduces direct glare and heat, and creates a sense of privacy—especially important for women in Mosul’s cultural context.”\n3. Community\u000b “These are women and children gathered safely under a courtyard canopy of vines. Beyond cooling, courtyards become social hubs—spaces for storytelling, chores, and learning, which lower stress levels by roughly 30 %.”\n4. Dignity\u000b “When we design with biophilia—plants, shade, social space—we’re not just cutting degrees on a thermometer.

Shading & ROI Sheet– Laptop with Courtyard-ROI.xlsx\nEnter 300 W/m² → 100 W/m², capture 2.5-yr pay-back screenshot\nRotation Brief (5 min)\n\nPurpose:\n  Introduce the three hands-on stations and ensure smooth transitions so everyone practices all key skills.\n\nSetup:\n  • Project this slide centrally.\n  • Arrange three clearly labeled work areas.\n  • Place A3 plans + rulers at Station 1.\n  • Place cardboard, smoke sticks, fan at Station 2.\n  • Ensure each laptop is open to Courtyard-ROI.xlsx at Station 3.\n  • Keep a whistle/ bell at hand for rotation cues.\n\nFacilitator Script:\n  “Alright team, it’s time for our Apply block! We have three stations—each focused on turning today’s theory into practice. \n   • **Station 1, Courtyard Design Sprint**, is right here: grab an A3 plan, scale rulers, and sketch your ideal 3×3 m courtyard—don’t forget airflow arrows!\n   • **Station 2, Cardboard + Fan Model**, is over there: use the desk-fan, smoke sticks, and a cardboard ‘roof’ to build and film a 10-second smoke demo showing stack-ventilation.\n   • **Station 3, Shading & ROI Sheet**, has laptops loaded with our Courtyard-ROI.xlsx: enter the baseline (300 W/m²) and the improved case (100 W/m²), then screenshot your resulting 2.5-year pay-back.\n\n  You’ll spend **25 minutes** at each station. I’ll blow the whistle when it’s time to rotate—so pack up quickly and move to the next station. Let’s begin at Station 1. Ready? Go!”\n\nKey Points:\n  1. Each station reinforces a different aspect: design, physical testing, and financial modelling.\n  2. Time management is crucial—25 minutes means focus.\n  3. Clear naming conventions (e.g., Team1_Station1.jpg) will help us collect your work.\n\nLocal Example:\n  “Remember Ahmed’s café courtyard idea from Day 1—today you’ll actually sketch, mock up, and calculate its payoff.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1: At the whistle, form teams at Station 1.\n  Step 2: Work intensively for 25 minutes.\n  Step 3: When you hear the whistle again, save your files/photos, pack up, and move to Station 2.\n  Step 4: Repeat until all three stations are complete.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • Issue: Teams run out of time before documenting.  \n    Solution: Assign one ‘recorder’ who takes the screenshot or labels images halfway through.\n  • Issue: Laptop fails to open ROI sheet.  \n    Solution: Keep a PDF backup on USB; let participants manually note pay-back.\n\nTransition:\n After Station 3, we’ll gather for a quick group debrief of key insights before lunch.\n\n\nStation 1: Courtyard Design Sprint\nDay 2\nDraw a 3 × 3 m courtyard insertion on the plan\nMark airflow arrows showing stack-driven ventilation\nLabel key zones (e.g. shaded, open, living)\nOutput\nPhoto or scan named TeamX_CourtyardSketch.jpg\nStation 1: Courtyard Design Sprint (25 min)\nPurpose:\nPractice rapid courtyard concept design, applying passive stack-vent principles.\n\nSetup:\n  • Each team sits at a table with the A3 site plan laid flat.\n  • Distribute scale rulers, fine-tip markers, and sticky labels.\n  • Display this slide and orient teams to their space.\n\nFacilitator Script:\n  “Welcome to Station 1! For the next 25 minutes, your mission is to insert a 3 × 3 meter courtyard into the 150 m² plan—just like heritage houses in Mosul. Use your scale ruler for accurate sizing, then sketch airflow arrows that show how warm air exits and cool air enters via the courtyard void.\n   Don’t forget to label at least three zones (for example, shaded seating, direct sun, and breezeway). When you finish, take a clear photo of your A3 sketch, name it `TeamX_CourtyardSketch.jpg`, and upload it to our shared folder.”\n\nKey Points:\n  1. **Accuracy:** Use the ruler to maintain true scale—3 m must measure 3 cm if plan is 1:100.\n  2. **Clarity:** Arrows should clearly indicate air movement—warm up, cool down.\n  3. **Heritage Alignment:** Think of traditional Mosul homes’ courtyards when zoning.\n\nLocal Example:\n  “Remember Fatima’s courtyard from Day 1, where a small void cut indoor temps by several degrees—today you’re recreating that in plan form.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1: Check your table has a plan, ruler, and marker.\n  Step 2: Set a timer for 20 minutes—start sketching immediately.\n  Step 3: In the last 5 minutes, refine labels and arrows.\n  Step 4: Photograph and upload your sketch before moving on.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • **Over-detailing:** If running out of time, focus on the courtyard and arrows; skip decorative elements.\n  • **Scale errors:** If the courtyard looks too large/small, double-check your ruler calibration (1 : 100).\n\nTransition:\n  “When the whistle blows, save your image and rotate to Station 2—Cardboard + Fan Model—where you’ll physically test the same stack-vent idea. Ready? Go!”\n\nStation 2: Cardboard + Fan Model\nDay 2\nAssemble the cardboard roof over the courtyard opening\nPlace an incense stick inside to simulate warm air\nFilm a 10-second clip showing smoke drawn up and out\nExperiment: turn fan on/off to compare natural vs. forced stack effect\nOutput\nShort video named TeamX_StackVent.mp4\nStation 2: Cardboard + Fan Model (25 min)\nPurpose:\n  Demonstrate passive and assisted stack-ventilation in a scaled model.\n\nSetup:\n  • Each team finds a “mini-house” model with a removable roof section.\n  • Provide one incense stick per model and a USB-powered desk fan.\n  • Ensure phones or a shared camera are ready to record.\n\nFacilitator Script:\n  “Welcome to Station 2! You’re now building a physical version of your courtyard ventilation. First, attach the cardboard roof panel with its central opening. Light an incense stick inside the model to generate smoke. Without the fan, observe how heat naturally pulls the smoke upward through the opening—this is stack effect. Then turn on the USB fan at low speed to see how cross-ventilation amplifies the effect. Record a clear 10-second clip of the smoke rising (natural) and then with the fan (assisted). Name your file `TeamX_StackVent.mp4` and upload it when done.”\n\nKey Points:\n  1. **Natural Stack:** Warm air rises on its own—no mechanical input.\n  2. **Assisted Flow:** A small breeze triples the smoke exhaust rate.\n  3. **Visual Proof:** Your video should clearly show the difference.\n\nLocal Example:\n  “Imagine these smoke trails in a real Mosul courtyard under 49 °C—this is how families cool their homes naturally.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  Step 1: Attach roof panel, light incense, start recording.\n  Step 2: Film 5 seconds of smoke with fan off.\n  Step 3: Turn on fan, film 5 more seconds with fan on.\n  Step 4: Stop recording, review clip, upload to shared drive.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • **Smoke too faint:** Use a fresh incense stick or lower the fan height.\n  • **Camera angle off:** Position phone at roof opening level, not above.\n\nTransition:\n  “When the whistle sounds, share your video and rotate to Station 3—Shading & ROI Sheet—where you’ll quantify energy impacts.

In the yellow input cells, type 300 for baseline solar gain (W/m²), then 100 for your improved courtyard scenario. Watch how the pay-back period updates—mine shows about 2.5 years. Once you see that, take a screenshot named TeamX_CourtyardROI.png and upload it. This number is your proof point: heritage-inspired design pays back in under three years.”\nKey Points :\nBaseline vs. Retrofit: Lowering heat gain from 300 to 100 W/m² yields significant savings.\nPay-Back Metric: The months/years until investment recovers via energy savings.\nFinancial Story: Short pay-back strengthens your sales pitch.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 2.5-year pay-back means courtyard retrofits cost no more than a small generator and then actually save money.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: Enter 300 in the “Baseline W/m²” cell.\u000b Step 2: Enter 100 in the “Retrofit W/m²” cell.\u000b Step 3: Observe calculated pay-back in the summary box.\u000b Step 4: Screenshot the ROI output and save as instructed.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b • Issue: File prompts for password.\u000b Solution: Use the offline copy on the USB drive.\u000b • Issue: Screenshot shows blank cells.\u000b Solution: Scroll to visible ROI chart area before capturing.\nTransition :\u000b “When your screenshot is saved, upload it and prepare to return to the Empathy-Map slide for a final touch-up before lunch.”\n\nEmpathy Map\nDay 2\n“10 min – collect before lunch.”\nTask: For the “Ahmed family,” fill:\nFEEL\nSEE\nPAIN\nGAIN\nWorksheet: Empathy-Map template (1 per team)\nSubmit: Drop completed maps in folder\nEmpathy Map (10 min)\nPurpose:\u000b Synthesize your day’s field data—thermal proof, visual insights, lot trace—into the Ahmed family’s core needs and motivations.\nSetup:\nTeams seated with their A3 sketches and photo notes.\nEmpathy-Map worksheets distributed, one per team.\nPens/markers ready.\u000b\nMaterials needed:\nPrinted Empathy-Map grid (Feel/See/Pain/Gain)\nSticky dots from earlier (optional)\nCollected IR-gun photos and visual-gallery notes\u000b\nPre-activity checks:\nVerify each team has a copy of Ahmed’s persona facts on their worksheet.\nEnsure teams have one pen per person.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “You’ve gathered temperatures, tagged photos, and sketched a courtyard.

Now Volunteer 2, your turn.”  \n  [After Volunteer 2]  \n  “Great — everyone, give them a round of applause for getting creative!”  \n\nKey Points:\n  1. Clear, concise hook sets the tone for your pitch.  \n  2. Peer applause highlights what worked (energy, clarity, relevance).  \n  3. You’ll build on these hooks in today’s Role-Play segment.\n\nLocal Example:\n  “Last week, one trainee opened with: ‘Tired of sweating through your night prayers? Let’s cool your home the heritage way.’ That grabbed the room immediately.”\n\nActivity Instructions:\n  1. Two volunteers read their 20 s scripts at the front.  \n  2. Group claps after each one.  \n  3. Trainer notes one particularly strong phrase to revisit later.\n\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\n  • **Issue:** Volunteer overruns 20 s.  \n    **Solution:** Trainer gently rings bell or says “stop” at 20 s.  \n  • **Issue:** Quiet delivery.  \n    **Solution:** Prompt volunteer to project voice or step closer to the mic.\n\nTransition:\n  “Excellent work! Those hooks remind us why we started Module 3: to blend heritage smarts with modern comfort.

Ready? Let’s go!”\n\nIce-Breaker: “Insulation Relay”\nDay 3\n00:30 - 00:40 – Ice-Breaker – Insulation Relay (10 min)\u000b Purpose: Quickly engage the group with hands-on familiarity of our three material options, reinforcing their relative R-value performance.\nSetup:\nArrange three distinct sample pieces (foam block, cork tile, Isocam membrane) at the front.\u000b\nAsk participants to form three lines (or rows) facing forward.\u000b\nEnsure open space for safe passing.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Okay everyone, it’s time to wake up our senses! We’ve got three insulation samples: foam, cork, and Isocam.”\u000b\n“Each line will pass the samples one by one down the row. When the last person receives all three, they must shout in order: ‘Good, Better, Best.’”\u000b\n“And what do those terms map to?” (Wait for answers: Good = foam, Better = cork, Best = Isocam.)\u000b\n“Exactly—foam is good, cork is better, and Isocam is best for our climate.”\u000b\n“Ready? On my whistle, start passing!” (Blow whistle.)\u000b\nAfter first round: “Great—foam felt thinnest and lightest, cork was denser, and Isocam felt like a solid membrane—just as expected.”\u000b\n“Let’s do one more round for speed!” (Repeat once if time allows.)\u000b\nKey Points:\nFoam offers basic insulation—lightweight but lowest R-value.\u000b\nCork boosts performance with natural thermal mass.\u000b\nIsocam membrane delivers top-tier performance for extreme heat.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “Remember how Fatima’s renovation used Cork in the attic and cut roof heat by 10 °C? That ‘better’ step made a real difference.”\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Samples get dropped or confused.\u000b Solution: Pause, re-label each sample clearly, and restart quickly.\u000b\nIssue: Some participants don’t hear the order.\u000b Solution: Hold up a small flash-card with the words “Good,” “Better,” “Best” during the exercise.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Well done! Having felt those differences, let’s look at our Day 3 agenda so you know what’s next.”\n\nDaily Agenda \n(3-Block Rhythm)\nDay 3\nFacilitator notes:\nBefore we dive into today’s content, I want to show you the heartbeat of our entire training: the 3-Block Rhythm.\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.\n“In this block, feel free to ask questions—that’s exactly what it’s for.”\u000b\n🛠️ APPLY (Second Block)\nWhat it is: Hands-on practice. You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action? Let’s switch to learning objective day 3”\n\n\nDay 3 Learning Objectives\nContrast reflective coatings vs thermal mass vs cavity insulation\nCompute U-values for heritage-inspired walls\n\nMix & test local materials—Thermostone, Labkh, cork, foam\nProduce ROI for partial façade (sun-facing walls) upgrade\nDraft contractor-transparent BOQs (material + labour split)\nDay 3\n00:45 - 00:55 – Learning Objectives (10 min)\u000b Purpose: Clarify today’s targets so everyone knows the skills and outcomes they’ll achieve by day’s end.\nSetup:\u000b • Display slide listing five bullet-point objectives\u000b • Participants seated, slide visible\nFacilitator Script:\u000b “Here are our five objectives for Day 3. Keep these in mind as we move through Learn, Apply, and Sell segments.”\nMix & test local materials – You’ll handle Thermostone, Labkh, cork, and foam samples to feel their differences.\u000b\nContrast envelope strategies – We’ll compare reflective coatings, thermal-mass walls, and cavity insulation to see which blocks heat best.\u000b\nCompute U-values – From R-values you’ll measure, you’ll calculate each wall assembly’s U-value for heritage-inspired designs.\u000b\nDraft transparent BOQs – You’ll build a simple contractor BOQ showing material and labour splits for partial façade upgrades.\u000b\nProduce partial-façade ROI – Model return on investment for a 50 m² sun-facing wall upgrade, then negotiate a “Sun-Side First” plan.\u000b\nKey Points:\nHands-on material testing grounds theory in reality.\u000b\nUnderstanding R vs U guides your design choices.\u000b\nTransparent BOQs build client trust.\u000b\nROI ties technical work back to money saved.\u000b\nNegotiation skills close the deal.\u000b\nLocal Example:\u000b “In Mosul’s Old City, a sun-facing mashrabiya retrofit cut cooling loads by 30 %, delivering payback in under four years.”\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Overwhelmed by technical terms.\u000b Solution: We’ll keep formulas simple and hands-on samples will make values tangible.\u000b\nIssue: Worry about time for BOQ exercise.\u000b Solution: We’ll guide you step by step, and the BOQ template will do most calculations for you.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Now let’s dive into our first Learn block: Insulation Metrics 101.”\n\nLearn\n\nInsulation Metrics 101 – R & U\n“The higher the R-value, the better the insulation quality is”\n“The lower the U-value of a material, the better its performance”\n\n\n\nR = m²·K/W  U = W / m²·K\nDay 3\n00:55 – Definitions Slide: R-Value vs U-Value (5 min)\u000b Purpose : Ground everyone in the core insulation metrics so material choices make sense.\u000b Setup : Project slide at front; leave space on whiteboard beside it for quick notes.\u000b Materials needed : Three cut-samples (foam, 3 cm cork, Isocam membrane), λ-value datasheet excerpt.\u000b Pre-activity checks : Ensure each sample is labeled with its thickness; verify whiteboard marker works.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Let’s start by defining two metrics you’ll use today: R-value and U-value. R-value tells us how well a material resists heat flow—the higher, the better. U-value is its inverse: it’s the rate of heat transfer per square meter per degree—so lower is better.”\nKey Points :\nR = thickness ÷ λ (units: m²·K/W)\nU = 1 ÷ R or W/m²·K\nAlways match material thickness and λ-value to your climate needs\u000b\nLocal example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 3 cm cork panel (λ ≈ 0.04 W/mK) gives R ≈ 0.75 m²·K/W—compare that to 1 cm foam (λ ≈ 0.025) which is only R ≈ 0.4.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: Pass the three samples down each row—feel their thickness and note any visible density differences.\u000b Step 2: On the whiteboard, write the formula R = thickness / λ, then calculate R for one sample as a group.\u000b Step 3: Ask one volunteer to invert that R value to get U and record it next to the formula.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b Issue: Confusing units (meters vs centimeters)\u000b Solution: Always convert thickness to meters before dividing by λ.\u000b Issue: Thinking higher U-value is better\u000b Solution: Remind: U is “leakiness,” so less is more.\nTransition :\u000b “Now that we know how to quantify insulation performance, let’s look at typical R-values in common building materials.”\n\nR-Value Table - Common Building Materials\nDay 3\n01:00 – R-Value Table (7 min)\u000b Purpose : Show the spectrum of insulation performance so teams can choose materials strategically.\u000b Setup : Project a clear table of 8–10 common materials and their R-values. Leave space on whiteboard for jotting examples.\u000b Materials needed : Printed handout or projected slide of R-Value table (foam, cork, brick, concrete, wood, PIR, XPS, EPS).\u000b Pre-activity checks : Ensure everyone can read the smallest font; confirm marker works for whiteboard notes.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Now that we know how to calculate R and U, let’s see real values for materials you’ll actually work with. This table shows R-value per material—higher resistivity means better insulation. Take a moment to scan through and think which ones fit Mosul’s climate and budget.”\nKey Points :\nLightweight foams and PIR/XPS panels have R ≈ 3–6 m²·K/W.\u000b\nTraditional materials (brick, stone) sit below R 1 m²·K/W.\u000b\nWood and cork are mid-range (R ≈ 1–2 m²·K/W) but offer heritage appeal.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “A 10 cm layer of expanded polystyrene (EPS) gives you around R 2.8—similar to a 15 cm thick traditional mashrabiya wall, but at half the thickness.”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, pick two materials—one “high R” and one “low R”—and write their R-values on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 2: Debate which you’d specify for a sun-facing wall vs. an interior partition.\u000b Step 3: Volunteer teams share their choices (1 min each) and rationale.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b Issue: Confusing material thickness vs. R-value.\u000b Solution: Remind: table is already normalized to standard thickness. Focus on relative performance.\u000b Issue: Assuming “best R” always wins.\u000b Solution: Emphasize trade-offs: cost, heritage look, moisture risk.\nTransition :\u000b “Great discussion—next we’ll flip these R-values into U-values so you can compare whole assemblies.”\n\nU-Value Table\nDay 3\n01:07 – U-Value Table (8 min)\u000b Purpose : Reinforce the inverse relationship between resistance and conductance so teams grasp why U-value matters in real assemblies.\u000b Setup : Project the U-Value table slide and leave room on the whiteboard to jot sample calculations. Arrange participants so they can see both screen and board.\u000b Materials needed : Projected slide of U-Value table; whiteboard and marker.\u000b Pre-activity checks : Verify slide is legible from back row; confirm whiteboard marker writes clearly.\nFacilitator Script :\u000b “Here we flip R on its head: U-value tells us how much heat passes through per square meter per degree difference. Lower U means less heat gain. Take a moment to scan: you’ll notice traditional brick sits around U 0.8, while Thermostone is down at U 0.2—four times better.”\nKey Points :\nU = 1/R, so doubling R halves U.\nDense materials like concrete block have high U (≈1.3–1.5).\nSpecialty insulators (Thermostone) can achieve U <0.3 despite light weight.\u000b\nLocal Example :\u000b “In Mosul, a 30 cm solid brick wall (U ≈0.85) will let roughly three times more heat inside than a 10 cm Thermostone panel (U ≈0.21).”\nActivity Instructions :\u000b Step 1: In pairs, choose two materials from the table—one high U and one low U—and calculate the ratio of their heat gains (e.g. 0.85 ÷ 0.21 ≈ 4).\u000b Step 2: Write your ratio and material names on the whiteboard.\u000b Step 3: One pair volunteers to explain why that ratio matters for selecting sun-facing walls.\nCommon Issues & Solutions :\u000b Issue: Confusing U and R units.\u000b Solution: Remind: R in m²·K/W resists heat; U in W/m²·K conducts heat. Higher U = more heat leak.\u000b Issue: Thinking density improves insulation.\u000b Solution: Emphasize: density affects thermal mass, not directly conduction—focus on U-values for insulation decisions.\nTransition :\u000b “Great insight—next, we’ll see these differences in action under our heat lamp and confirm the numbers with IR readings.”\n\nDemo Setup & Procedure \nMaterials\n60 W desk lamp\nThree wall-assembly samples labeled “Good,” “Better,” “Best”\nIR thermometer\n\nSteps\nPosition lamp 15 cm above Sample A\nTurn on lamp for 60 s\nMeasure and record surface temperature with IR gun\nRepeat for Samples B and C\nDay 3\n01:15 – Demo Setup & Procedure (5 min)\u000b Purpose: To let participants see firsthand how different wall assemblies translate into measurable surface-temperature differences under a uniform heat source.\nSetup\u000b • Physical arrangement: Demo table at front, with lamp stand on left and three samples laid out in a row. Arrange participants in a semi-circle so everyone can observe.\u000b • Materials needed: 60 W desk lamp, samples labeled Good/Better/Best, IR gun, stopwatch or phone timer, data sheet for recording.\u000b • Pre-activity checks: Verify lamp bulb is working and stable; confirm IR gun reads ambient temperature correctly; use a tape measure to mark exactly 15 cm on the lamp stand.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Okay everyone, we’re about to test our three wall ‘sandwich’ assemblies under identical conditions. We’ll heat each sample for one minute and then capture surface temperature readings. Remember: lower surface temp means less heat transfer inside—and that’s money saved on generator or AC load.”\nKey Points\nConsistent geometry ensures fair comparison—same lamp distance and time for each material.\nSurface-temperature differences directly relate to thermal performance (higher R-value → lower temp).\nΔT between samples indicates how much cooling load you can shave off.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “In Mosul’s July sun, even a 5 °C drop can make the top floor livable without running a generator all night.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: Position lamp 15 cm above Sample A and start timer for 60 seconds.\u000b Step 2: When time’s up, point the IR gun at the sample surface and record the temperature on the shared sheet.\u000b Step 3: Move to Sample B, repeat the 60 s heating and temperature reading. Then Sample C.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b • Issue: Lamp is too close or too far → uneven heating.\u000b Solution: Use the 15 cm mark on the lamp stand for consistency.\u000b • Issue: IR gun misreads shiny surfaces.\u000b Solution: Aim at a matte patch or use emissivity setting if available.\nTransition\u000b “Great, now that we have our raw temperature data, let’s move to the next slide and see all three results side-by-side for easy comparison.”\nNext Slide: Live Results & ΔT Comparison\n\nLive Results & ΔT Comparison\nDay 3\n01:20 – Live Results & ΔT Comparison (10 min)\u000b Purpose : To visualise and compare the real temperature reductions delivered by each wall assembly under identical heat conditions, making the performance gap undeniable.\nSetup :\u000b • Screen/projector ready with the bar chart slide.\u000b • Confirm that each team has their recorded temps to cross-check.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s look at our results. On the left, the ‘Good’ assembly peaked at 62 °C. Cork brought us down to 57 °C, a 5 °C drop. But notice ‘Best’—Isocam membrane—bottomed out at 55 °C, for a full 7 °C reduction compared to foam. That ΔT translates into big savings on cooling fuel or generator runtime.”\nKey Points ::\nMain concept :: Larger ΔT equals lower heat transfer and lower operating cost.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Every degree you save could cut generator run-time by roughly 5 % in Mosul’s climate.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Material cost × ΔT gives you a quick cost-per-degree metric for ROI.\u000b\nLocal Example ::\u000b “In July 2024, families reported that even a 6 °C reduction let them sleep indoors without rooftop camping—or running their generator all night.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Ask teams to confirm their own recorded temperatures match the chart.\u000b Step 2: Invite one team to share any unexpected readings.\u000b Step 3: Note which assembly they’d choose for a rental-market retrofit.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Teams recorded ambient errors (room too cool).\u000b Solution: Remind them to subtract the ambient temperature reading from surface temps before comparing.\u000b Issue: Bar labels overlap.\u000b Solution: Adjust label positions—top-center of each bar.\nTransition ::\u000b “With those numbers front-and-center, we’re ready to dive into real-world assembly options. Next up: Case studies of three roof-wall ‘sandwich’ assemblies and how heritage tweaks can further improve performance.”\n\nWall “Sandwich” Case Studies\nOption\nRoof-Wall “Sandwich”\nCost / m² (IQD)\nBonus heritage tweak\nGood\nFoam + Bitumen + Tile\n50000\nRecess window 15 cm\nBetter\nCork + Water-proof coat\n75000\nAdd mashrabiya shade\nBest\nIsocam Membrane\n100000\nLight-colour top (SRI > 90)\nDay 3\n01:30 – Wall “Sandwich” Case Studies (15 min)\u000b Purpose : Ground participants in real-world cost–performance trade-offs, linking cold-hard numbers to heritage strategies they’ve just tested.\nSetup :\u000b • Projector or large screen displaying the table slide.\u000b • Samples (or photos) of each sandwich assembly at trainer’s table.\nMaterials needed :\u000b • Printed A3 summary handouts of the three assemblies.\u000b • Three small icons or sample cut-outs of recess, mashrabiya, colour finish.\nPre-activity checks :\u000b • Confirm slide visibility from all parts of the room.\u000b • Handouts distributed to each team.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Here we see three ways to build your roof-wall assembly. The ‘Good’ option uses foam and bitumen for 50 k IQD per square metre—think of it as our entry-level solution, plus a 15 cm recessed window for added shade. The ‘Better’ option trades up to cork with a waterproof coat at 75 k, plus a mashrabiya screen to catch breezes. And the ‘Best’—Isocam membrane at 100 k with a light-coloured cap—yields maximum drop in surface heat. Each step up costs more, but also delivers bigger ΔT and longer payback life.”\nKey Points ::\nMain concept :: Incremental investments buy sharper thermal performance.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Heritage tweaks multiply the basic assembly’s impact at minimal extra cost.\u000b\nSupporting detail :: Clients often skip the middle ‘Better’ option—but that’s where balance lives.\u000b\nLocal Example ::\u000b “In Al-Muallim district, one family chose ‘Better’—cork plus mashrabiya—and reported 4 °C cooler bedrooms with zero generator use on most days.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Ask teams to compare which assembly they’d propose for a budget-conscious homeowner.\u000b Step 2: Have them note the most persuasive heritage tweak in their handout margins.\u000b Step 3: Invite one voice per team to share their pick and rationale.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Participants fixate on cost, not performance.\u000b Solution: Prompt them: “What ΔT are you buying per 25 k IQD?”\u000b Issue: Confusion over tweaks.\u000b Solution: Hold up the small icon/sample and restate its function.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great insights—next, we’ll pause for a short break, then reconvene to apply these numbers in our ROI sprint.”\n\n\nApply\n\nSandwich ROI Sprint\nOpen “Wall-ROI.xlsx” on your laptops\nInput: 50 m² sun-facing wall area\nSelect Good / Better / Best assemblies\nRead pay-back results (years)\nHighlight your team’s pay-back (≈ 3.5–4 yr)\nDay 3\n01:55 – Sandwich ROI Sprint (30 min)\u000b Purpose\u000b Provide hands-on practice calculating real pay-back periods for three wall assemblies, reinforcing cost-benefit decision-making.\nSetup\u000b Physical arrangement – Each team at a laptop station with power and Wi-Fi disabled (offline file).\u000b Materials needed – Preloaded Excel file “Wall-ROI.xlsx,” calculators, pens.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Confirm each laptop has the correct file version and that teams can open and edit.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Okay everyone, time to put numbers to those ‘Good, Better, Best’ assemblies. Open the Wall-ROI spreadsheet. You’ll enter 50 m² for the sun-facing wall, then choose each sandwich option in turn. Watch how the pay-back years change—most of you will see around 3.5 to 4 years. That’s our real-world gauge of value. Work as a team to confirm your numbers and circle the fastest pay-back.”\nKey Points\nPay-back = Total upgrade cost ÷ annual energy savings.\u000b\nA shorter pay-back (< 3 yr) is very compelling for clients; 3.5–4 yr is still strong in Mosul’s market.\u000b\nMaterial cost jump from Good→Better buys roughly 0.5–1 yr of pay-back improvement.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “In Karadah district, one contractor pitched the cork option because it paid back in 3.2 years—families there saw immediate savings and referred him widely.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: On the first sheet, enter “50” in the wall-area cell.\u000b Step 2: Toggle the assembly dropdown from Good to Better to Best.\u000b Step 3: Record each pay-back value on your team worksheet.\u000b Step 4: Circle the shortest pay-back and prepare to share your finding.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b Issue: Spreadsheet won’t recalc when assembly changes.\u000b Solution: Press F9 or re-select the dropdown value to force recalc.\u000b Issue: Teams can’t find the pay-back cell.\u000b Solution: Guide them to column H, row 12 (labeled “Pay-back (yrs)”).\nTransition\u000b “Great work—lock in your pay-back insight, and next we’ll turn those numbers into buildable details with a wall-section sketch.”\n\nEmpathy Map Touch-Up\nReview your Ahmed family’s Empathy Map quadrants: FEEL, SEE, PAIN, GAIN\nAdd one new PAIN and one new GAIN based on wall upgrade insights (heat relief + cost)\nUse different-colour stickies for new entries\nDay 3\n02:55 – Empathy Map Touch-Up (10 min)\u000b Purpose\u000b Ensure that our technical solutions (improved envelope) connect to real user needs—link heat reduction and pay-back benefits to the Ahmed family’s emotional landscape.\nSetup\u000b Physical arrangement – Teams seated around their original Empathy Map board.\u000b Materials needed – Coloured stickies (new colour), markers, flip-chart space to post maps.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Verify each team has space on the board and fresh stickies; marker ink is working.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Now that you’ve seen how these wall ‘sandwiches’ cut heat and deliver a 3.5–4 year pay-back, let’s revisit our Ahmed family map. On a new sticky, jot down one additional PAIN they’ll feel relieved of—and one extra GAIN they’ll enjoy—because of your wall upgrade. Use green stickies for GAINS and red for PAINS. You have ten minutes—go!”\nKey Points\nLink technical benefit (ΔT reduction) to emotional relief (no more rooftop sleeping).\u000b\nTie pay-back timeline to financial security (monthly savings).\u000b\nEmphasise dignity: cooler rooms for women to use living spaces.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “In Qadisiyah, a family reported that after their ‘Better’ wall upgrade, the grandmother could sit inside in summer for the first time—that’s a new GAIN we should capture.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: Identify one new PAIN alleviated by cooler walls or lower bills.\u000b Step 2: Identify one new GAIN (comfort, dignity, savings).\u000b Step 3: Place stickies in the PAIN and GAIN boxes and write a brief note.\u000b Step 4: Stand back and review your map—ready to share.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b Issue: Teams struggle to differentiate old vs new stickies.\u000b Solution: Remind them to use only the new-colour stickies for this activity.\u000b Issue: Some map areas are overcrowded.\u000b Solution: Encourage them to cluster similar insights or use the flip-chart next to the board.\nTransition\u000b “Fantastic—those fresh insights will fuel your budget-conscious sales pitch. Next, we’ll dive into our mini-talk on framing sun-side upgrades for cost-sensitive clients.”\n\nSell\n\nBudget-Conscious Sales Mini-Talk\nDay 3\n03:05 – Budget-Conscious Sales Mini-Talk (10 min)\u000b Purpose\u000b Equip participants to propose phased upgrades that fit clients’ budgets while still delivering strong ROI and comfort gains.\nSetup\u000b Physical arrangement – Trainer stands beside screen; teams seated with calculators or laptops.\u000b Materials needed – Slide queued, calculator or ROI app demo ready, laser pointer.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Verify slide appears correctly; test pointer.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Let’s talk about cash flow. Not every client can pay for their entire façade retrofit today, but they all want cooler rooms—and quick pay-back. That’s where our ‘Sun-Side First’ strategy comes in: we tackle the hottest wall first, so they see immediate ΔT relief and cost savings.”\u000b “On the right, you see two options: a single up-front payment or a three-month instalment plan with just a 5 % surcharge. Even with that small fee, they still hit their ROI in under four years. Which approach would you recommend to a budget-conscious homeowner?”\nKey Points\nPhased upgrade reduces initial outlay but maintains sub-4 yr pay-back.\u000b\n“Sun-Side First” maximises early comfort and builds trust.\u000b\nClear instalment terms (surcharge, schedule) eliminate sticker-shock.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “In eastern Mosul, a contractor offered a client an instalment plan and closed the deal faster—because the homeowner saw that even with a small surcharge, their monthly cost was cheaper than generator fuel.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: Ask each team to pick cash or plan and jot down one client benefit.\u000b Step 2: Have one volunteer share why their choice works for Ahmed family.\u000b Step 3: Note any questions or objections, and how you’d address them.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b Issue: Clients think instalment surcharge negates ROI.\u000b Solution: Point out monthly savings vs generator bills and emphasise cumulative comfort ROI.\u000b Issue: Teams get bogged in numbers.\u000b Solution: Keep discussion high-level—focus on pay-back below four years and emotional relief.\nTransition\u000b “Great insights. Next, we’ll jump into our live ROI and payment-plan calculator demo so you can practice customizing numbers on the spot.”\n\n*screenshot Pre-loaded Excel template with three wall-sandwich options and financing columns\nTeams enter:\n– Cash up-front cost per m² × area\n– 3-month instalment schedule (with 5 % surcharge)\nAutomatic chart plotting cumulative cash flow over years\nBreak-even marker (≈ 3.5–4 yr)\nLive ROI & Payment-Plan Calculator\nDay 3\n03:15 – Live ROI & Payment-Plan Calculator (15 min)\u000b Purpose\u000b Let participants experience real-time financial modelling and see how different payment structures impact cash-flow and pay-back timing.\nSetup\u000b Physical arrangement – Trainer at the laptop connected to projector; teams with calculators or laptops.\u000b Materials needed – Pre-loaded “Wall-ROI.xlsx” on trainer’s computer and USB drives for each team; projector remote.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Open the Excel file and verify chart updates when sample numbers are changed; ensure each team has access to the template.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Now that you understand the numbers, let’s put them into our live calculator. You’ll see immediately how paying cash up-front or in instalments shifts the cash-flow curve—and where your break-even point falls.”\u000b “Please enter the same sun-wall area and unit costs you used in the mini-talk: cash price in column A and instalment plan in column B. Watch the chart update as you type.”\u000b “Notice how the instalment curve starts below zero for the first three months but still crosses into positive savings by year four.”\nKey Points\nSeeing numbers update in real time builds confidence when presenting to clients.\u000b\nBreak-even visualization makes ROI tangible and understandable.\u000b\nTeams can tailor payment plans to match client cash flow without sacrificing pay-back targets.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “In a recent Mosul retrofit, a homeowner chose the 3-month plan after seeing the chart: their friends switched on the AC just three months after installation, proving the investment paid off fast.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: Each team inputs their chosen sandwich cost and area into both “Cash” and “Instalment” fields.\u000b Step 2: Observe the chart and note the break-even year.\u000b Step 3: Screenshot or photograph your chart for inclusion in your 1-minute pitch deck.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b Issue: Chart does not update when numbers change.\u000b Solution: Remind teams to press Enter after typing and ensure macros/calculations are enabled.\u000b Issue: Teams get stuck on surcharge percentages.\u000b Solution: Confirm the 5 % surcharge cell formula is pre-filled; they only need to change the area or unit cost.\nTransition\u000b “Great work! Now that you have a clear ROI chart, we’ll ground these figures in real customer stories. Next up: a testimonial clip that brings these numbers to life.”\n\n*45-second video featuring Ghassan’s homeowner client\nCustomer Testimonial Clip\nDay 3\n03:30 – Customer Testimonial Clip (5 min)\u000b Purpose\u000b Leverage a real client’s voice to reinforce credibility and show proof that numbers translate into lived comfort and savings.\nSetup\u000b Physical arrangement – Trainer at the laptop, connect sound to speakers; screen at full volume.\u000b Materials needed – Prepared video file queued, clicker or spacebar for start/stop.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Test audio levels briefly before invitation to watch; ensure lighting dims if possible.\nFacilitator Script\u000b “Let’s hear from one of our clients, Ghassan, in Mosul. He experienced a 17 °C drop in his upstairs rooms and saw his investment return in under four years.”\u000b [Play video]\u000b [Pause at 00:45]\u000b “That testimonial embodies trust—he’s one of your future referrals.”\nKey Points\nThird-party proof is more persuasive than any slide we could show.\u000b\nConcrete numbers (17 °C, pay-back under four years) stick in the mind.\u000b\nPersonal stories create emotional resonance alongside data.\u000b\nLocal Example\u000b “A client in Old Mosul told me she moved her grandmother back indoors after the retrofit—something she hadn’t done in years.”\nActivity Instructions\u000b Step 1: Watch the full 45-second clip without interruption.\u000b Step 2: Turn to your neighbor and share in one sentence what stood out most. (30 s)\u000b Step 3: Be ready to call out your takeaway when I ring the bell.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b Issue: Video stutters or audio is too low.\u000b Solution: If stutter occurs, pause and restart from last key quote.

Let’s quickly pull forward yesterday’s advances before we dig into software. I’ll ring the bell, then in your table groups share one item per prompt. Keep each under eight seconds, and let’s hear from as many tables as we can.”\nKey Points ::\nΔT recall – Connect physical demos to performance metrics\nMaterial choice – Reinforce the Good/Better/Best framework\nBudget pitch – Tie cost modeling to persuasive messaging\nLocal example ::\u000b “Remember when Team 2 spotted that 8 °C drop with cork? That’s the kind of data that wins a client’s trust in Mosul’s heat.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nRing bell → Table 1 shares their ΔT result\nNext bell → Table 2 names their favorite assembly and reason\nNext bell → Table 3 cites one top budget argument\nContinue rotating through tables until time’s up (aim for 4–5 tables)\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Tables go off-topic\nSolution: Gently steer back: “Great example—now keep it to the prompt.”\nIssue: One table dominates\nSolution: Pause, invite the next table: “Thanks, now over to Table 4.”\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Fantastic—those insights ground us in real numbers and client needs. Now, before our software deep-dive, does anyone have a burning question from Day 3?”\n\nYour Questions Answered\nDay 4\n00:25 Facilitator notes (10 minutes):\nSet the Stage (20 s):\u000b “Before we dive into Day 4, let’s wrap up yesterday. You posted great questions on our Reflection Wall—here are the top three.”\nRead & Respond (3 min):\nQ1: …\u000bA1: …\nQ2:...\u000bA2:...\nQ3:...\u000bA3:...\u000b\n(After each answer, pause for up to one quick follow-up question—15 s max.)\u000b\nTransition to Ice Breaker (20 s):\u000b“Great questions! “With yesterday’s questions answered, let’s energize the room with our Day 2 ice-breaker:x. Ready? Let’s go!”\n\nIce-Breaker: “Plugin Ping-Pong”\nDay 4\n[00:35 – 00:45 – Ice-Breaker: Plugin Ping-Pong (10 min)]\u000b Purpose : Quick energizer, verify all participants have Rhino + Ladybug ready\u000b Purpose : Energize the room and confirm software installs before the deep-dive\nSetup :\u000b • Physical arrangement – Tables in staggered rows; clear aisle for passing stick\u000b • Materials needed – One USB stick per row, timer/chime, small snack prize\u000b • Pre-activity checks – Confirm each trainer has tested USB ports on conference PCs\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright everyone, it’s time for Plugin Ping-Pong! You’ll pass this USB stick from the front of your row to the back. When it reaches the last person, they must plug it in and shout ‘Installed!’ Ready? Go!”\nKey Points ::\nSpeed and accuracy – It’s a race, but each install must complete\nSoftware check – This confirms Rhino + Ladybug are accessible on your machine\nTeamwork – Build energy through cooperative competition\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul’s reconstruction projects, getting tools installed swiftly can mean the difference between staying on schedule or missing critical field windows.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nAnnounce “Go!” and start the chime/timer\nParticipants pass the USB stick hand-to-hand down their row\nLast person inserts it, waits for the install confirmation dialog, then shouts “Installed!”\nFirst table to finish earns the snack—everyone else gives a round of applause\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b • Issue: USB won’t mount on a particular PC\u000b – Solution: Trainer swaps that stick to a different port or machine quickly\u000b • Issue: Late teams bunch up or bump into each other\u000b – Solution: Remind them to stay in their lanes and pass carefully\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—looks like everyone’s got the software ready. Let’s turn to our daily agenda so you know what comes next.”\n\nDaily Agenda \n(3-Block Rhythm)\nDay 4\nFacilitator notes:\nBefore we dive into today’s content, I want to show you the heartbeat of our entire training: the 3-Block Rhythm.\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.\n“In this block, feel free to ask questions—that’s exactly what it’s for.”\u000b\n🛠️ APPLY (Second Block)\nWhat it is: Hands-on practice. You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action? Let’s switch to learning objective day 4”\n\nDay 4 Learning Objectives\nInstall software (trainers suggested: Ladybug-Rhino) & run first annual cooling-load sim (30 % cut target)\nGenerate before/after heat-map visuals & short GIFs\nAttach cost layer to BIM quantities (BIM = Building Information Modelling)\nPrep data for social-media storytelling (one slide / one reel)\nDay 4\n[00:50 – 01:00 – Learning Objectives (10 min)]\u000b Purpose : Align the group on today’s four core outcomes so every activity ties back to these targets.\nSetup :\u000b • Physical arrangement – Participants seated, projector on the Objectives slide.\u000b • Materials needed – Clicker/laser pointer.\u000b • Pre-activity checks – Confirm slide is visible and that “Learn → Apply → Sell” footer fires in animation.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we’ve energized and outlined our day, let’s walk through our four Learning Objectives. These are the milestones that will guide every exercise and demo from here on out.”\nKey Points ::\nSoftware & Simulation – You’ll install and launch Ladybug in Rhino, aiming for at least a 30 % cooling‐load reduction.\nCost Integration – We’ll layer real‐world IQD costs onto your BIM quantities so your models become financial proposals.\nVisual Proof – You’ll create before/after heat‐maps and package them as GIFs—your visual evidence of impact.\nStorytelling Prep – Finally, you’ll format one slide or a 1–2 s GIF for social media, ready to hook clients online.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Last month, a local contractor used a Ladybug heat‐map GIF to win a green‐loan pitch—visual proof turned skeptics into signatories.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Read each objective silently as I point to it.\u000b Step 2: Nod if it resonates or raise one finger if you have a quick question.\u000b Step 3: We’ll refer back to these after each Learn, Apply, and Sell block.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Participants lose sight of objectives during hands-on work\u000b Solution: Trainer briefly recaps after each station, pointing back to the footer.\u000b Issue: Jargon confusion (“cost layer,” “BIM quantities”)\u000b Solution: Use concrete examples on the spot—show the Excel tab or BIM model.\nTransition ::\u000b “With these goals crystal clear, let’s dive into our first Learn block: the Ladybug–BIM deep-dive, where you’ll launch simulations for real Mosul conditions.”\n\nLearn\n\nLadybug + BIM Workflow\nImport 150 m² massing with courtyard\nToggle courtyard ON ↔ OFF\nRun annual cooling-load simulation (≥ 30 % target)\nOverlay moisture-risk isotherm\nExport heat-maps & CSV take-off\nDay 4\n 01:00 – Workflow Overview (10 min)\u000b Purpose : Ensure everyone understands the end-to-end simulation sequence before we dive into each tool. \nSetup : Physical arrangement -- Participants at their workstations with Rhino + Ladybug open; trainer at front with clicker.\u000b Materials needed -- Printed one-page flowchart handout for each team; sample 150 m² Rhino file loaded.\u000b Pre-activity checks -- Confirm toggle script works; verify Ladybug plugin is active; test export folder path. \nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Let’s map out our journey for the next forty minutes. We’ll start by importing our model, flicking the courtyard on and off, running an annual run, layering moisture data, and ending with exportable heat-maps and CSV quantity take-offs.”\u000b “Think of this as our recipe: once you master each ingredient, you’ll create your own digital proof of performance.”\nKey Points ::\nImporting the massing anchors your site context.\nCourtyard toggles isolate the heritage intervention impact.\nAnnual sims give the full-year cooling picture, not just snapshots.\nLocal example ::\u000b “Yesterday you saw a 3 °C drop in a simple Rhino demo; today you’ll confirm a ≥30 % load reduction over 12 months.”\u000b\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Hand out flowchart and highlight each icon.\u000b Step 2: Ask participants to locate the same buttons in their Ladybug panel.\u000b Step 3: Confirm by having one volunteer name each step in sequence.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: “Toggle” button missing in Rhino toolbar. -- Solution: Have participants restart Rhino and re-load the Ladybug plugin.\u000b Issue: Export fails without proper folder path. -- Solution: Demonstrate setting the default “Results” folder in their user preferences.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—now that we all see the big picture, let’s jump into our first hands-on: toggling the courtyard on and off to generate those cooling-load numbers.”\nNext slide: Learn – Courtyard ON ↔ OFF Simulation\n\nCourtyard ON ↔ OFF Simulation\n*Full-bleed Rhino viewport screenshot showing the 150 m² massing with courtyard visible.\nA bright call-out arrow pointing to the ON/OFF toggle in the Ladybug toolbar.\nA second arrow pointing to the “Run Annual Simulation” button.\nDay 4\n01:10 – Courtyard ON ↔ OFF Simulation (10 min)\u000b Purpose : Give hands-on practice toggling the heritage intervention and running a full-year simulation to see real impact.\u000b Setup : Participants at workstations with the 150 m² Rhino model already loaded; trainer standing by with clicker.\u000b Materials needed : – Flowchart handout reminder – 150 m² Rhino file with courtyard layer – Ladybug plugin active\u000b Pre-activity checks : Verify everyone sees the Ladybug toolbar; ensure no geometry errors in the model.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Here’s our first live run. Step 1: flick that courtyard toggle OFF to get your baseline. Step 2: switch it back ON to include the void. Notice how the model changes in real time.”\u000b “Next, click ‘Run Annual Simulation.’ This will compute cooling-load over 12 months. In a moment, you’ll see the percentage reduction—our digital proof of heritage cooling.”\nKey Points ::\nThe ON/OFF toggle isolates the courtyard’s effect—no courtyard, no performance gain.\nRunning an annual sim gives a comprehensive picture, not just a snapshot.\nThe percentage result is what we’ll use in our ROI and sales story.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Yesterday’s quick demo showed a 3 °C drop in surface temperature; this annual sim translates that into a 30 % electricity saving over the year.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: In Rhino, click the courtyard layer toggle to OFF, then ON.\u000b Step 2: In the Ladybug panel, click the ‘Run Annual Simulation’ icon.\u000b Step 3: Watch the progress bar and then note the ‘Cooling-Load Reduction: XX %’ value. Record it on your worksheet.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: The toggle button is grayed out. -- Solution: Check that the courtyard layer is unlocked and visible in Rhino’s layer manager.\u000b Issue: Simulation hangs at 0 %. -- Solution: Pause, then restart Ladybug or reimport the model.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great work—now that we’ve quantified cooling-load savings, let’s overlay moisture-risk data next to ensure our designs stay dry and durable.”\n\nMoisture-Risk Isotherm Overlay\n*Full-bleed Ladybug graphic showing the same 150 m² massing colored by dew-point risk.\nLegend in a corner: “Blue = Safe Zone; Purple = Condensation Risk.”\nDay 4\n01:20 – Moisture-Risk Isotherm Overlay (10 min)\nPurpose : Highlight potential condensation spots so participants can balance cooling gains with moisture safety.\u000b Setup : Trainees still at their Rhino+Ladybug workstations; trainer on mic to guide the overlay.\u000b Materials needed : 150 m² model with Ladybug, legend handout with color definitions.\u000b Pre-activity checks : Confirm everyone’s heat-map ran successfully; dew-point analysis layer available.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now we augment our cooling analysis with moisture-risk data. In Ladybug, toggle on the ‘Dew-Point Isotherm’ layer.”\u000b “Notice the areas colored purple—these zones have a temperature differential below 5 °C, so condensation can form.”\nKey Points ::\nCooling voids can create cold surfaces where humidity condenses.\nThe 5 °C threshold is the industry standard for dew-point risk.\nBalancing ΔT and risk keeps our designs both cool and durable.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “In Mosul’s winter, we saw mould on inner walls when insulation ΔT dropped below 4 °C—this overlay would have predicted that.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: In Ladybug’s analysis menu, check “Dew-Point Isotherm.”\u000b Step 2: Adjust the threshold slider to 5 °C if needed.\u000b Step 3: Identify and note the percentage of roof area at risk. Record on your worksheet.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: No purple appears on the map. -- Solution: Check ambient humidity input in the Ladybug settings.\u000b Issue: Legend symbols overlap geometry. -- Solution: Drag the legend to an empty corner or reduce its opacity.\nTransition ::\u000b “With both cooling-load and moisture data in hand, our next step is exporting these heat-maps and take-off CSVs so we can build our BOM and ROI workbook.”\n\nExporting Data & Take-Off CSV\n*Screenshot of Ladybug’s Export panel highlighting the “CSV Take-Off” button.\nDay 4\n01:30 – Exporting Data & Take-Off CSV (10 min)\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Here’s the critical step: exporting your take-off CSV. Click the ‘CSV Take-Off’ button in Ladybug’s Export panel.”\u000b “Follow our naming convention exactly so we can automatically link these files into the ROI workbook.”\nKey Points ::\nThe CSV contains all area, volume, and cooling-load numbers you need.\nConsistent file naming lets the ROI sheet pull data without manual entry.\nOrganizing by team folder avoids confusion when multiple exports land in the same directory.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Last month, Team A mislabeled their export and we lost five minutes troubleshooting. Today we stick to our format: Team2_Sandwich_TakeOff.csv.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: In Ladybug’s Export panel, click “CSV Take-Off.”\u000b Step 2: Name the file exactly Team#_Sandwich_TakeOff.csv.\u000b Step 3: Save in \\Project\\Day4\\Exports<YourTeam#>. Confirm you see it in Explorer.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: “CSV Take-Off” button is grayed out. – Solution: Rerun the simulation or restart Ladybug.\u000b Issue: File saved in wrong folder. – Solution: Move it immediately and notify the trainer if you can’t find it.\nTransition :\u000b “Great—now that you have your CSV, let’s take a quick break. After the break we’ll reconvene to import these numbers into our BOM and ROI workbook.”\n\n\nApply\n\nPolish & Simulate Your Model!\n🧹 Clean up geometry: remove sketch lines & ensure courtyard void is solid\n🎨 Apply your chosen sandwich materials to each façade\n⚙️ Set Ladybug parameters: Annual cooling sim + moisture overlay\nDay 4\n01:50 – Model Refinement & Simulation Setup (20 min)\u000b Purpose: Make sure every team’s 150 m² model is tidy, correctly layered, and simulation-ready so our heat-maps & CSV outputs are accurate.\nSetup: \u000bEach workstation with Rhino open to the shared 150 m² file; Ladybug plugin loaded.\u000b Materials needed: Rhino model, material library loaded, Ladybug panel visible.\u000b Pre-activity checks: Confirm courtyard void is a closed polysurface; verify sandwich materials appear in Layers panel; test one quick sim preview earlier.\nFacilitator Script:: “Okay everyone—this is where precision pays off! Think of your Rhino model like your client’s home: neat, correctly detailed, and ready for performance testing. In the next 20 minutes you’ll clean geometry, assign your heritage-inspired sandwich, and dial in Ladybug’s annual cooling and moisture settings. Let’s dive in!”\nKey Points:: \u000b 1. Clean geometry prevents sim errors (no stray lines!).\u000b 2. Correct material assignments feed accurate thermal properties.\u000b 3. Right Ladybug settings = trustworthy heat-map & CSV take-off.\nLocal example:: “Here’s mine—see how I hid my construction lines and gave the north wall the Cork+Coat sandwich? My sim ran super smooth.”\nActivity Instructions::\u000bStep 1: Hide or delete any construction lines—only solid surfaces remain.\u000b Step 2: In the Layers panel, assign each façade its sandwich material layer.\u000b Step 3: Open Ladybug → set “Annual Simulation” on, tick “Moisture Isotherm,” then click Run.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b :: Issue: Model won’t simulate—error about invalid geometry.\u000b Solution: Zoom in, find stray lines or open polysurfaces; repair with Join or Cap.\u000b :: Issue: Missing material in dropdown.\u000b Solution: Re-load your sandwich library or restart Ladybug plugin.\nTransition: “Great work—once your sim finishes, we’ll move to exporting your heat-map PNG and CSV take-off so you can earn that ‘Cool-Pro’ stamp!”\n\nExport Heat-Map & CSV\nPNG 📷\n• Run Ladybug → click “Export Image”\n• Save as Team1_HeatMap.png\nCSV 📊\n• Click “Export CSV Take-Off”\n• Save as Team1_TakeOff.csv\n30 %+ cut → earn your “Cool-Pro” stamp!\nDay 4\n02:10 – Exporting Deliverables & Stamp Criteria (20 min)\u000b Purpose: Ensure every team knows exactly which files to produce and earns the facilitator’s “Cool-Pro” stamp once they hit ≥30 % cut.\nSetup: Workstations still running Ladybug; export dialogs pre-opened if possible.\u000b Materials needed: Rhino + Ladybug session, file-save dialog ready.\u000b Pre-activity checks: Confirm each team’s simulation has completed without errors; check Ladybug panel shows >30 % cooling reduction.\nFacilitator Script:: \u000b“Alright teams, now that your simulations are done, it’s time to capture your results. We need two items from each of you: the heat-map image and the CSV take-off. Save them with your team number so I can stamp you ‘Cool-Pro’ as soon as I verify your cut is 30 % or more.”\nKey Points:: \u000b1. Exact filenames matter—use Team#_HeatMap.png and Team#_TakeOff.csv.\u000b 2. The heat-map PNG is your visual proof; the CSV is the data proof.\u000b 3. I’ll come around with my stamp once both files are in your folder and your reduction ≥30 %.\nLocal example:: “Here’s a demo: I exported my map as Team1_HeatMap.png and the take-off CSV as Team1_TakeOff.csv. See? Got my stamp right away!”\nActivity Instructions:: \u000bStep 1: In Ladybug, click Export Image → navigate to shared folder → name it Team#_HeatMap.png.\u000b Step 2: Click Export CSV Take-Off → choose same folder → name it Team#_TakeOff.csv.\u000b Step 3: Raise your hand; I’ll confirm your simulation result and add your stamp.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b :: Issue: “Export Image” button greyed out.\u000b Solution: Ensure the simulation has fully finished (check progress bar).\u000b :: Issue: CSV file too large or missing data.\u000b Solution: Re-run take-off tool, verify sample area matches your façade selection.\nTransition : “Great—once you’re stamped, we’ll move on to building your BOM and populating the ROI workbook tabs.”\n\nBuild Your BOM & ROI\nImport CSV → BOM\n– Click “Data → Import CSV”\n– BOM tab auto-populates quantities & units\nEnter Prices → ROI\n– Input supplier cost per unit\n– Watch ROI & cash-flow chart update\nDay 4\n02:30 – APPLY – BOM + ROI Tabs (30 min)\u000b Purpose: Guide teams to turn their simulation outputs into a complete bill of materials and financial analysis.\nSetup: Each team’s folder contains their Team#_TakeOff.csv. Workbook “Digital-ROI.xlsx” open at the BOM sheet.\u000b Materials needed: Excel workbook pre-connected to ROI chart, calculator or device for quick cost lookup.\u000b Pre-activity checks: Verify each team’s CSV file is in their folder and named correctly; confirm workbook macros are enabled.\nFacilitator Script:: “Now that you’ve earned your Cool-Pro stamp, let’s populate your BOM. First, import your CSV take-off—this fills the quantities for each material. Then, type in your supplier or quoted price per unit. Instantly, you’ll see your ROI chart update with pay-back years and cash-flow lines.”\nKey Points:: \u000b1. The imported CSV gives accurate quantities—no manual entry needed.\u000b 2. Correct unit pricing is critical—double-check your supplier quotes.\u000b 3. The ROI chart reflects both cash cost and financing options side-by-side.\nLocal example:: “For Team1, I imported their CSV and entered 75,000 IQD/m² for cork. Instantly, the chart showed a 3.8-year payback.”\nActivity Instructions:: \u000bStep 1: In Excel, go to the BOM sheet → click Data → Import CSV → select Team#_TakeOff.csv.\u000b Step 2: Review auto-filled Quantity and Unit columns; correct any mismatches.\u000b Step 3: Enter your chosen supplier price under the “Cost” column.\u000b Step 4: Switch to the ROI tab and observe the updated payback period and cash-flow chart.\nCommon Issues & Solutions\u000b :: Issue: Imported columns misaligned.\u000b Solution: Check that CSV columns match the template headers; re-import if needed.\u000b :: Issue: ROI chart not updating.\u000b Solution: Ensure macros are enabled and that the “Cost” cells are formatted as numbers.\nTransition : “Once everyone has a clear ROI chart, we’ll move into Budget Reality Check to ensure your client proposals are both compelling and feasible.”\n\nSell\n\nTariff Toggle Demo\n*screenshots of your ROI chart with the tariff set to 8 ¢\n*screenshots of your ROI chart with the tariff set to 17 ¢\nDay 4\n[03:00 – Tariff Toggle Demo (10 min)]\nPurpose :\u000b Show teams how changing the energy tariff dramatically shifts their ROI curve, reinforcing the value of targeting the right financing assumptions.\nSetup :\u000b • Trainer laptop open to the “ROI Workbook.”\u000b • Projector displaying the chart and tariff input cells side by side.\u000b • Ensure both “Tariff (¢/kWh)” fields and the pay-back chart are visible.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright, everyone: here’s our baseline pay-back at 8 ¢ per kWh. Now watch what happens when we bump that to 17 ¢—slide your eyes to the orange curve. See how the breakeven point nearly halves? That’s the power of accurate rates in your pitch.”\nKey Points ::\nUtility Cost Impact: Higher unit cost shortens pay-back.\nChart Interpretation: The “knee” of the curve marks your breakeven year.\nAssumption Sensitivity: Small tariff changes can make or break your ROI story.\u000b\nLocal Example ::\u000b “In Mosul, generator fuel at peak summer can cost closer to 17 ¢ per kWh. Using that real number here makes your proposal far more compelling to a cautious homeowner.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nTrainer toggles the tariff cell from 8 ¢ to 17 ¢.\u000b\nPause 10 s for teams to note the breakeven shift on their own screens.\u000b\nAsk one team to call out the exact year change.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b • Issue: Teams can’t find the tariff cell.\u000b Solution: Point to the labeled input box at the top of the sheet.\u000b • Issue: Chart doesn’t update.\u000b Solution: Remind them to hit “Recalculate” or ensure auto-calc is on.\nTransition :\u000b “Great—now that we’ve validated our tariff assumption, let’s check for any dangerously high markups. Up next: Markup Validation & Red-Flag Cells.”\n\nMarkup Validation & Red-Flag Cells\n*screenshot of the ROI workbook’s “Markup %” column, with any cells over 40 % glowing red\n“Keep your markup ≤ 40 % to stay competitive”\nDay 4\n03:10 – Markup Validation & Red-Flag Cells (5 min)\u000b Purpose : Ensure pricing stays realistic by instantly flagging excessive markups.\u000b Setup :\u000b Physical arrangement -- Trainer laptop/projector showing the exact workbook view; all teams on their own screens.\u000b Materials needed -- ROI workbook pre-loaded with sample data; projector remote.\u000b Pre-activity checks -- Confirm conditional formatting is active so red highlighting works.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now that we’ve nailed our tariffs, let’s make sure we’re not over-pricing. See this markup column? Anything above 40 % turns red automatically. Why? Because home-owners know a fair margin is under that threshold.”\nKey Points ::\nReal-time feedback – red cells catch high margins instantly.\nCompetitive edge – staying under 40 % keeps you in the game.\nEthical practice – fair pricing builds trust and referrals.\nLocal Example ::\u000b “In Mosul’s market, clients often push back hard when they spot our margin jumping above 35 %. Keeping it under 40 % makes negotiations smoother.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Each team scans their markup column for red cells.\u000b Step 2: If any red appears, adjust one line-item’s markup downward until the red disappears.\u000b Step 3: Share the final highest markup % with your neighbor.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: No red formatting appears.\u000b Solution: Check that the “Markup %” column uses the correct conditional-format rule (Highlight > 40 %).\u000b Issue: Teams can’t find which row to adjust.\u000b Solution: Remind them that overhead and labour are easiest to trim by renegotiating vendor rates or cutting ancillary costs.\nTransition :\u000b “Perfect—our prices are now both profitable and fair. Next up is our Digital-Marketing Sprint, where you’ll turn these results into a 60-second clip for clients and bosses.”\n\nTemplate: Hook → Proof→ ROI → Ask\nDigital-Marketing Sprint\n“60-second clip using your team’s heat-map & ROI chart”\nDay 4\n03:15 – Digital-Marketing Sprint (25 min)\nPurpose : Transform your technical findings into a compelling marketing message that clients and bosses will love.\nSetup :\u000b Physical arrangement – Teams grouped around phones or laptops with VN (VivaVideo) app installed; projector ready to demo.\u000b Materials needed – Heat-map PNGs, ROI charts (PNG/CSV), phones with VN app, 4-step template cards.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Confirm each device can import images into VN; distribute template cards.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright teams, it’s time to become digital storytellers. You have your heat-map for proof and your ROI numbers for impact.

Next, we’ll swap videos with another team for peer-review iterations to refine your message even further.”\n\nSocial Feedback Loop:\nUpload your 60-s clip to our WhatsApp channel; \nClassmates drop 🔥 emojis to signal top spots. \nThen tweak your caption in real-time.\nLive Supplier Call:\nUse the speakerphone to ring a local supplier; \nRequest a formal quote and screenshot the response for our Market Wall.\n🔥 Emoji Lab & Quote Quest\nDay 4\n[03:40 – Peer-Review Iterations (15 min)]\u000b Purpose : Rapidly refine both messaging and real-world costing by combining peer feedback with live market data.\nSetup :\u000b • Physical arrangement — Teams seated with phone & laptop access, WhatsApp group open on projector.\u000b • Materials needed — Mobile phones, supplier contact list, Market Wall space with push-pins.\u000b • Pre-activity checks — Ensure Wi-Fi or mobile data is working; speakerphone set to moderate volume.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright everyone, it’s time to see how the market and your peers react to your work. First, upload your 60-second heat-map marketing clip to our WhatsApp group. Watch for those 🔥 emojis—those mark the strongest hooks. As you see feedback roll in, tweak your caption on the spot to make it even sharper.\u000b Next, switch gears: call one of the suppliers on our list using the speakerphone. Ask for today’s price on that wall-sandwich material. Screenshot their reply and pin it to our Market Wall. This gives you a real quote to compare with your Excel estimates.”\nKey Points ::\nSocial proof accelerates clarity—peer reactions highlight what resonates.\nLive market quotes ensure your ROI pitches remain grounded in real costs.\nIteration in class simulates fast-turnaround client revisions.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Last month, when we did this with Samir’s team, they realized their caption missed mentioning the 17 °C drop—adding that detail after a 🔥 tag boosted engagement immediately.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Upload clip to WhatsApp and watch reactions (5 min)\u000b Step 2: Adjust your caption based on top 3 🔥 reactions (5 min)\u000b Step 3: Call supplier on speaker, request price, screenshot, and pin to Market Wall (5 min)\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: WhatsApp upload fails — Solution: Use the backup QR-linked server or send via USB and project for feedback.\u000b Issue: No 🔥 reactions — Solution: Prompt two classmates to give honest feedback on what’s missing, then refine.\nTransition : :\u000b “Great work! Now that we’ve sharpened your messaging and grounded your costs, let’s draft the final Boss & Client Deck—your last step before graduation.”\n\n⚡️ Lightning Pitches\n“2 min Deck Pitch”\n“1 min Rapid Q&A”\n“Peers score (0–3)”\nDay 4\n04:20 – Lightning Pitches (20 min)\nPurpose : Give teams a low-stakes, high-energy run-through of their boss/client deck before tomorrow’s activation.\nSetup :\nChairs in semicircle facing screen\nLarge digital timer visible\nFlip-chart ready for scores\u000b\nMaterials needed :\nEach team’s draft boss/client deck (USB or printed)\nProjector & clicker\nScore sheets & pens\u000b\nPre-activity checks :\nDeck file names match team numbers\nTimer connected and tested\nDistribute score sheets\u000b\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright everyone, let’s fire up our ⚡ Lightning Pitches!

First, you’ll learn how to re-frame those status-driven big-glass requests into prestige-meets-comfort recommendations. Next, we’ll practice our Peers–Precedent–Proof script to build instant trust. Then, you’ll shoot and edit short social clips that showcase thermal wins. After lunch, we’ll craft concise lifecycle-cost decks tailored for boss and client buy-in. We’ll then run live pitch-backs with colleagues and capture interest metrics. Finally, we’ll explore the evolving Iraqi finance landscape—from Italian investment to green loans—so you can position your services for real market demand.”\nKey Points ::\nRe-frame Big-Glass: Prestige vs. comfort—turn a vanity ask into a value offer.\nTrust Script: Quick, structured peer examples to build credibility.\nSocial Clips: Hands-on filming and editing to amplify proof visually.\nCost Decks: A slide-by-slide template for end-user and boss.\nPitch-Backs: Practice with live feedback and simple metrics.\nMarket Trends: Speak confidently about Italian funds and bank loans.\u000b\nLocal Example ::\u000b “For instance, a client wants floor-to-ceiling windows. We’ll show them how a mashrabiya-inspired screen preserves their view (prestige) while cutting heat by 4 °C (comfort).”\nActivity Instructions ::\nRead through each objective aloud.\nInvite one quick question per objective (max 6 questions total).\nConfirm understanding before moving on.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Objectives feel abstract – Solution: Tie each to a concrete Day 5 activity you’ll do in the lab.\u000b Issue: Too many bullets on slide – Solution: Read only one or two at a time, then pause for a nod.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—now that we know our roadmap, let’s dive into our Content-Creation Lab and start filming those thermal wins!”\n\nLearn\n\nContent-Creation Lab\n*a large “before” screenshot from VN\n*a smaller “after” screenshot with three numbered call-outs.\n[01:05 – Content-Creation Lab (15 min)]\u000b Purpose : Set the stage for polishing raw footage into a broadcast-ready clip.\nSetup :\u000b Physical arrangement – Trainer at laptop/projector; teams seated with phones.\u000b Materials needed – One sample clip in VN on screen; each team’s rough 60 s file.\u000b Pre-activity checks – VN app open; volume muted; “before” clip loaded.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “All right, everyone—today’s mission is to transform your rough cut into something you’d be proud to show a client or post on Instagram.”\u000b “On the left is our raw footage; on the right are three key places we’ll touch: (1) Arabic captions, (2) an emoji for emphasis, and (3) a clear ‘Call us’ button overlay.”\nKey Points ::\nCaptions improve accessibility and clarity.\nEmojis draw the eye and convey emotion instantly.\nA bold, 3-second CTA seals the deal.\nLocal example ::\u000b “Last cohort used the same call-out steps to boost WhatsApp inquiries by 40 %.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Watch my live demo of adding each element (5 min).\u000b Step 2: Pause at call-out frames; teams practice on their phones (7 min).\u000b Step 3: Export a local draft and queue it for peer review (3 min).\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: “Captions overlap the subject.” – Solution: Move text block to top 20 %.\u000b Issue: “File too large to export.” – Solution: Lower resolution to 720p, trim silent tails.\nTransition : “Great—now that you’ve seen the nuts and bolts, let’s dive into the Logic ⚙–Emotion ❤️–Trust ✅ scaffold to structure your message.”\u000b\nNext slide: Logic ⚙ Emotion ❤️ Trust ✅ Scaffold\n\nLogic ⚙ Emotion ❤️ Trust ✅ Scaffold\n⚙ Logic → “Data-driven hook: 30 % bill ↓”\n❤️ Emotion → “Imagine that cool breeze”\n✅ Trust → “Peer testimonial clip”\n[01:20 – Logic ⚙ Emotion ❤️ Trust ✅ Scaffold (10 min)]\u000bPurpose : Give teams a simple, memorable structure to frame their clip content.\nSetup :\u000b • Physical arrangement – Trainer laptop/projector visible; teams have pens and paper for notes.\u000b • Materials needed – Slide loaded; sample testimonial GIF ready.\u000b • Pre-activity checks – Confirm GIF plays correctly; volume on mute.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Every marketing clip needs three things: a hook that makes sense, an emotional connection, and a proof point to build trust.”\u000b “Our scaffold labels them: ⚙ Logic, ❤️ Emotion, and ✅ Trust. Under Logic, we lead with your data—‘30 % bill ↓.’ Under Emotion, paint the feeling—‘Imagine that cool breeze.’ Under Trust, drop in a real peer testimonial.”\u000b “Let me show you: here’s a quick 5-second demo of pasting a testimonial GIF right under the ✅ Trust column.”\nKey Points ::\nLogic anchors you with facts—viewers need a reason to care.\nEmotion turns facts into desire—beyond numbers, it’s about comfort.\nTrust seals the deal—social proof makes your claim credible.\nLocal example ::\u000b “Last month, Fatima’s team used this scaffold and saw a 30 % uptick in inquiry clicks.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Sketch your clip’s three elements on paper using this template (3 min).\u000b Step 2: In VN, drop your data text, add an emotional emoji overlay, then insert your testimonial GIF (5 min).\u000b Step 3: Play back and confirm all three pillars appear in sequence (2 min).\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b • Issue: “Emotional text feels forced.” → Solution: Use everyday language: “Feel breezy.”\u000b • Issue: “Testimonial clip lags.” → Solution: Trim to 3 s and re-export.\n Transition : “Great work—next, let’s go over some Pro Tips and our final Export Checklist before you send your master clip to the world.”\n\nFinal Polish & Send-off\n☐ Tight trims at 0:02 & 0:20 marks\n☐ Text legible at ≥24 pt\n☐ Logo + CTA visible within first 3 seconds\n☐ Export as ≤25 MB, 720p MP4\n01:30 – Pro Tips & Export Checklist (15 min)\u000b Purpose : Ensure every clip is crisp, clear, and share-ready before submission.\nSetup :\u000b • Physical arrangement – Projector showing this slide; teams at their workstations.\u000b • Materials needed – Trainer has VN app open, file-size tool visible.\u000b • Pre-activity checks – Confirm everyone can play back their draft at 720p.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “We’re in the home stretch—let’s apply some final polish and get these clips out the door!”\u000b “First, trim out any dead air at the 2-second and 20-second marks—keep the pace snappy.”\u000b “Next, confirm your on-screen text is at least 24 points so viewers can read on any phone.”\u000b “Then make sure your logo and call-to-action pop up within the first three seconds—don’t hide the ask!”\u000b “Finally, export your file as a 720p MP4 under 25 MB so it’s WhatsApp-friendly.”\nKey Points ::\nSnappy edits hold attention—no extra pauses.\nReadability wins—bigger text is safer.\nEarly CTA drives action.\nLocal example ::\u000b “Last cohort sent a clip that hit 30 MB and wouldn’t upload—so let’s keep it lean!”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Apply trims and adjust timings in VN (5 min).\u000b Step 2: Increase any small text to ≥24 pt (3 min).\u000b Step 3: Ensure logo/CTA appear early, then export under 25 MB (7 min).\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: File exports at 40 MB → Solution: Lower bitrate or shorten clip by 1–2 s.\u000b Issue: Text still fuzzy → Solution: Re-position or change font weight.\n Transition : “Great! Take a quick stretch break now, then we’ll regroup for our final sprint.”\n\n\nApply\n\nFinal Clip Production\nShoot Missing B-Roll\nLadder, courtyard, sandwich, occupants\nAdd Arabic Subtitles\nUse VN’s “Captions” tool, 24-pt minimum\nExport Settings\n720p MP4 ≤ 25 MB\n01:55 – Final Clip Production (40 min)\u000b Purpose : Allow each team to consolidate their edits, capture any missing footage, and produce a client-ready 60 s video asset.\nSetup :\u000b • Tables arranged in U-shape so facilitators can circulate easily\u000b • Each team’s phone/tripod and VN project open on their device\u000b • Props (ladder, courtyard models, wall sandwich samples) within reach\nMaterials needed :\u000b • Smartphones or tablets with VN installed\u000b • Tripods or stable surfaces for B-roll\u000b • Cheat-card with export settings\nPre-activity checks :\u000b • Confirm each team has their raw cut loaded in VN\u000b • Verify sound is muted (or background music added)\u000b • Ensure there’s at least one team member ready to film\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright everyone, this is it—the final sprint. You have 40 minutes to film any missing B-roll, drop in your Arabic subtitles, and export your clip as a ≤ 25 MB, 720p MP4. I’ll be floating around to give one-on-one feedback, and we’ll review your exports at the end.”\nKey Points ::\nB-roll should clearly show your interventions (courtyard, sandwich wall, ladder safety)\nSubtitles must be legible at 24 pt and match spoken content\nExport resolution 720p, file ≤ 25 MB to ensure smooth sharing\u000b\nLocal example :\u000b “Remember Sara’s team yesterday—she added a quick shot of the mashrabiya shade at 0:15 and it tied the story together. Think about similarly simple cuts that reinforce your message.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Film any missing footage (B-roll of ladder, courtyard void, wall assembly) – 15 min\u000b Step 2: In VN, import new clips, add captions via ‘Captions’ tool, position CTA overlay – 15 min\u000b Step 3: Export your final MP4 at 720p ≤ 25 MB, name it Team#_FinalClip.mp4 – 10 min\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Export fails due to file size > 25 MB → Solution: Trim unneeded frames, reduce bitrate in export settings\u000b Issue: Subtitles overlap graphic elements → Solution: Drag text box up or shorten caption line\nTransition :\u000b “Great—once your clip is exported, upload it to our WhatsApp channel. We’ll kick off peer reviews next with some live feedback and early likes to guide your Day 5 activation.”\n\nPeer-Review & Like Harvest\nStep 1: Upload your final clip to the class WhatsApp channel\nStep 2: Watch for “🔥” reactions in real time\nStep 3: Tweak your caption and repost within 5 min\n02.35 Peer-Review & Like Harvest (30 min)\u000b Purpose: Generate authentic social proof and iterate messaging rapidly based on peer feedback.\nSetup:\nPhysical arrangement: Teams seated with phone/tripod; WhatsApp group pre-loaded.\nMaterials needed: Phones with clip file, tripods (if needed), Wi-Fi or hotspot.\nPre-activity checks: Confirm everyone’s clip is ready to share; test WhatsApp channel is working.\u000b\nFacilitator Script:\n“Alright everyone, it’s time to put your clips in front of a live audience—your peers!”\n“Step 1: Upload your clip to the WhatsApp group right now.”\n“Step 2: As soon as you see a ‘🔥’, note which caption wording sparked that fire.”\n“Step 3: You have five minutes to refine your caption and repost for round 2.”\u000b\nKey Points:\nSpeed matters: Quick tweaks capture momentum.\nSocial proof is powerful: Viewers trust popular content.\nIterate on insights: One small change can boost engagement.\u000b\nLocal Example:\n“Last week, a Mosul contractor swapped ‘Reduce bills by 30 %’ for ‘Save 50 IQD per hour’—likes doubled.”\u000b\nActivity Instructions:\nUpload: Teams press “send” on their clip.\nMonitor: Watch the 🔥 counter; note the best-performing caption.\nTweak & Repost: Edit only the caption, not the video; send updated version into the same thread.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions:\nIssue: Clip fails to upload.\u000b Solution: Use compressed MP4 (under 25 MB) or link a file-share URL.\nIssue: No 🔥 reactions after 5 min.\u000b Solution: Prompt peers by calling, “Who’s 🔥?” then ask for honest feedback.\u000b\nTransition:\u000b “Great insights! Now that we’ve seen what captions resonate, let’s channel that energy into our final client-deck presentations.”\n\n\nSell\n\nDeck Compilation Sprint\nClient Deck\nProblem → Solution → ROI\nEmbed QR code to your 60-s clip\nBoss Deck\nLogic → Risk Mitigation → Trust Proof\nEmbed same QR code\n03:05 – Deck Compilation Sprint (30 min)\u000b Purpose : Equip teams to craft two tailored pitch decks—one for end‐clients and one for decision‐making bosses.\nSetup :\u000b • Physical arrangement -- Teams at laptops in pairs, power outlets handy.\u000b • Materials needed -- PowerPoint/Canva deck templates (Client & Boss), your exported clip file, QR‐code generator link.\u000b • Pre‐activity checks -- Confirm each team has a working clip URL and template open.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Now it’s time to package all your hard work into two decks. One talks directly to homeowners—highlighting their pain, your solution, and the payback. The other targets their boss or bank officer—focusing on logic, risk management, and trust proof.”\nKey Points ::\nClient Deck must start with a clear problem statement and end with a compelling ROI number.\nBoss Deck needs bullet-proof logic: show numbers, address risks (e.g., maintenance, dust), then reinforce with peer testimonials.\nThe same clip QR code works in both—visual proof ties it all together.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Remember Ghassan’s renovation? His customer deck led to a 10-year service contract, while his boss deck secured a green loan at 5 % interest.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: In your Client template, insert: Slide 1 = Problem (photo + heat data), Slide 2 = Your courtyard solution + ΔT, Slide 3 = ROI chart + QR code.\u000b Step 2: In your Boss template, insert: Slide 1 = Cooling-load reduction table, Slide 2 = Tariff sensitivity & risk flags, Slide 3 = Testimonial clip screenshot + QR code.\u000b Step 3: Save both decks as PDF and share in the class folder by 03:35.\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: QR code unreadable on slide.\u000b Solution: Increase size to at least 2 × 2 cm and test with a phone.\u000b Issue: Boss deck too technical.\u000b Solution: Simplify language—use icons and short bullet points.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—once your decks are uploaded, we’ll move into our Pitch-Back Session to practice delivering them live.”\n\nPitch-Back Rehearsal\nRole-Card Feedback\nBoss: Score Clarity (0–3)\nColleague: Score Trust (0–3)\nTeam Rounds\n2-min Deck Pitch\n20-s Clip Showcase\n03:35 – Pitch-Back Rehearsal (30 min)\u000b Purpose : Give teams a live market practice—deliver their decks and clips, receive candid feedback, and sharpen their delivery.\nSetup :\nPhysical arrangement – Teams line up; you’ll have a timer visible.\nMaterials needed – Printed role cards (Boss / Colleague), score sheets, projector.\nPre-activity checks – Ensure audio works for all clips; timer is at hand.\u000b\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright everyone, this is our market rehearsal. Each team has two minutes to pitch their Client or Boss deck, then play your 20-second marketing clip. Your ‘boss’ and ‘colleague’ will score you—one on clarity, the other on trust. Let’s treat this as your first live client meeting!”\nKey Points ::\nStay on time – I’ll cue you at 1:30 and give a 30-s wrap-up warning.\nEngage your role-players – Ask eye contact, invite quick questions in the last 30 seconds if time allows.\nIntegrate your clip smoothly—no tech hitches.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “Imagine this is your first pitch to Engineer Ahmed—clear, concise, and backed by that heat-map clip.”\nActivity Instructions ::\nTeam A goes first. Timer starts at 2:00.\nAt 1:30, you get a 30-s warning.\nAfter pitch + clip, Boss and Colleague each fill a quick 0–3 score and one-line comment.\nRotate to the next team until all have presented.\u000b\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\nIssue: Clip won’t play.\nSolution: Have a backup on your phone; share screen if needed.\u000b\nIssue: Over-run time.\nSolution: I’ll gently cut you off at 2:00 and we’ll debrief quickly.\u000b\nTransition ::\u000b “Great job! Once all teams finish, we’ll launch our Alumni WhatsApp group and set up our monthly meetup schedule.”\n\nAlumni WhatsApp Launch\nScan Here\nDay 5\n04:05 – Alumni WhatsApp Launch (10 min)\u000b Purpose : Build community continuity—ensure participants stay connected, share wins, and access support.\nSetup :\u000b Physical arrangement – Project the slide with QR code; place printed backup QR cards on each table.\u000b Materials needed – Projector, printed QR cards, flip-chart to record meetup date.\u000b Pre-activity checks – Confirm participants have WhatsApp and camera ready for QR scan.\nFacilitator Script ::\u000b “Alright everyone, let’s become a community that lasts beyond today. First, point your phones at this QR code to join our Alumni WhatsApp group. Once you’ve joined, shout out a preferred date for our first monthly meetup and I’ll note it here.”\nKey Points ::\nInstant connection – Joining the group brings you tips and answers in real time.\nAccountability – Monthly meetups keep our momentum going.\nSupport network – Use this space to share questions, supplier leads, and success stories.\u000b\nLocal example ::\u000b “I’ve been part of a Mosul architects’ group that met monthly—every member brought a case study, and our collective experience improved each project.”\nActivity Instructions ::\u000b Step 1: Scan the QR code on-screen or from your printed card (1 min)\u000b Step 2: In the chat, post one sentence: “My ideal meetup date is ___” (3 min)\u000b Step 3: I’ll capture the top two dates on the flip-chart for a quick vote (5 min)\nCommon Issues & Solutions ::\u000b Issue: Can’t scan QR?\u000b Solution: I’ll drop the group link in chat—just tap to join.\u000b Issue: No WhatsApp?\u000b Solution: Let me know now; we’ll add you manually via your phone number.\nTransition ::\u000b “Great—now that our community is set, let’s celebrate your achievements with your certificates.”\n\n"

First identify 5 pros and 5 cons of the current presentation and facilitator notes\n2. Find 5 improvements\n3. Review the interview document to extract facilitation and training ideas\n4. Compile these into a table\n5. Compare against the current module to suggest improvements\n\nLet me start by reviewing the module structure and content carefully.\n\nFrom what I can see, this is a 5-day training module focused on green architecture and heritage-inspired design specifically for Mosul, Iraq. The training follows a consistent 3-block rhythm each day: Learn → Apply → Sell.\n\nLet me analyze the pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n1. Clear 3-block daily structure (Learn-Apply-Sell) that's consistent and predictable\n2. Highly contextualized to Mosul with local examples, prices in IQD, and cultural considerations\n3. Hands-on approach with practical activities like IR gun measurements, building models, and creating marketing materials\n4. Strong emphasis on ROI and business skills, not just technical knowledge\n5. Progressive skill building from basic concepts to digital tools to market activation\n\nCONS:\n1. Very dense content - each day seems packed with activities that might be rushed\n2. Heavy reliance on technology (Rhino, Ladybug, VN app) that may have technical issues\n3. Limited time for reflection and processing between activities\n4. Some activities seem repetitive (multiple empathy mapping sessions)\n5. Facilitator notes are sometimes too prescriptive, leaving little room for adaptation\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n1. Add buffer time between activities for technical troubleshooting and participant questions\n2. Include more peer teaching opportunities where successful participants help others\n3. Create simplified backup options for when technology fails\n4. Add more structured debriefing time after hands-on activities\n5. Include success metrics and assessment rubrics for each activity\n\nNow let me look at the interview document to extract training ideas...\n\n\nI cannot extract specific interview insights due to missing content. The Excel file appears empty, preventing me from pulling additional facilitation strategies. Despite this limitation, the existing training materials offer rich insights into the course design and potential improvements for the Mosul green architecture training program.\n\nThe key focus remains on creating a flexible, technology-supported learning experience that balances technical skills with practical application and market understanding.Looking at your Module 3 training materials for Green Architecture & Heritage-Inspired Design in Mosul, here's my analysis:\n\n## 5 PROS\n\n1. **Culturally Grounded Approach**: Excellent localization with Mosul-specific examples (Wifaq's 17°C comfort story, Fatima's heritage foundation), IQD pricing, and consideration of gender-specific needs (women's privacy in courtyards).\n\n2. **Consistent 3-Block Rhythm**: The Learn→Apply→Sell structure provides predictable flow and ensures theory translates to practice and market readiness each day.\n\n3. **Hands-On Learning**: Strong emphasis on tactile experiences (IR gun measurements, material samples, smoke demonstrations) that reinforce abstract concepts.\n\n4. **Business Integration**: ROI calculations, supplier calls, and marketing clip creation prepare participants for real market conditions, not just technical skills.\n\n5. **Progressive Complexity**: Well-scaffolded from basic concepts (Day 1) through digital tools (Day 4) to market activation (Day 5).\n\n## 5 CONS\n\n1. **Time Pressure**: 25-minute station rotations seem rushed for complex tasks like courtyard design and ROI calculations. Participants may feel stressed rather than engaged.\n\n2. **Technology Dependency**: Heavy reliance on Rhino/Ladybug software and VN app creates multiple failure points without adequate backup plans.\n\n3. **Repetitive Activities**: Empathy mapping appears 3+ times across days, which may feel redundant and reduce engagement.\n\n4. **Limited Reflection Time**: Reflection walls get only 5 minutes at day's end when participants are tired and rushing to leave.\n\n5. **Overly Prescriptive Facilitation**: Scripts like \"Great—those fresh insights will fuel your budget-conscious sales pitch\" feel inauthentic and limit facilitator flexibility.\n\n## 5 IMPROVEMENTS\n\n1. **Add Buffer Time**: Build in 5-10 minute \"tech troubleshooting\" buffers after each digital activity. This prevents cascade delays when inevitable issues arise.\n\n2. **Create Analog Backups**: For each digital activity, prepare a paper-based alternative (e.g., printed heat maps for manual ROI calculations if Ladybug fails).\n\n3. **Implement Peer Teaching**: After each Apply block, have successful teams briefly teach struggling teams. This reinforces learning and builds community.\n\n4. **Morning Reflection Circles**: Move reflection from end-of-day to start of next morning when minds are fresh. Begin each day processing yesterday's insights.\n\n5. **Flexible Facilitation Guides**: Replace word-for-word scripts with bullet points and key concepts, allowing facilitators to adapt to group energy and needs.\n\n## Interview Analysis\n\nUnfortunately, the interview document provided appears to be empty (no content in the Excel file). Without access to the actual interview data, I cannot extract specific facilitation ideas or create the requested comparison table. \n\nTo complete this analysis, I would need:\n- The actual interview transcripts or summaries\n- Names of interviewees\n- Their specific suggestions about training methods\n\nIf you can provide the interview content, I'll gladly create a comprehensive table comparing their suggestions against your current module structure and identify specific improvements based on their feedback.",
