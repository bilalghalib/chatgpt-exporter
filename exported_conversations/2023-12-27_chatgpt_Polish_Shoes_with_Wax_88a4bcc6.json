      "content": "To polish shoes with wax and colored shoe polish, start by cleaning the shoes with a soft brush or cloth to remove dirt. Apply a thin layer of wax polish with a circular motion using a soft cloth or brush, focusing on small sections at a time. Allow the wax to dry, then buff it to a shine with a brush or soft cloth. Next, apply the colored shoe polish in a similar manner, let it dry, and buff again for a high shine. Finish by using a clean cloth for a final buff to bring out the shine.",
