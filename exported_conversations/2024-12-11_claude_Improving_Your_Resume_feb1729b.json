Identifying this nexus between heritage and the needed transformations to a more sustainable construction sector built bridges and excited people to look into and take pride in their own history to build their own future. \n2. Biggest challenges was getting information and connecting with the right stakeholders. Going on site and creating open contexts for people to share in meetups and working with local organizations like Mosul Space opened doors to a diversity of people from universities, govornent sector, and local entrepreneurs. Moving from requesting digital forms to be filled out to in-person meetings in groups. And then from broad groups to 1-1 meetings proved to create the depth and space to get the most interesting and accurate insights. Lunch meetings are great! ;D\n3.

By working with stakeholders like Mosul Space and creating open, collaborative contexts—from broad meetups to 1:1 lunch meetings—I navigated challenges of access and information-sharing, uncovering rich insights. Test runs with participants transformed the curriculum through their feedback, shifting critique into collaboration and ensuring the final product was engaging, relevant, and impactful. This project would not have been possible without the generosity and expertise of local partners, whose connections and ideas turned concepts into actionable realities. My creativity, enthusiasm, bridge-building, and focus on valuing people’s contributions—plus the occasional well-placed snacks—helped bring this initiative to life.\n\n15:06\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nShorter and more pro and I don't want as many adjectives, you always add things like \"rich insights\" - why not be more clear without the flurr? \n15:06\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nAt the International Trade Centre (ITC), I developed a sustainable construction curriculum that connected heritage architecture with modern practices, encouraging pride in local traditions while addressing climate-smart solutions.

Test runs with participants ensured the curriculum was practical and responsive, transforming feedback into improvements. Collaboration with local partners was essential, providing the connections and information needed to turn ideas into reality. My ability to build bridges, foster connections, and adapt processes played a key role in the project’s success.\n\n15:06\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nMaybe we can talk about the history of post conflict reconstruction and the idea of learning from the past to build the future is language i liked to use.

I facilitated workshops in Arabic, traveled frequently to Mosul, and collaborated closely with local partners to ensure the curriculum was practical, relevant, and culturally grounded. By creating spaces for open dialogue, from broad meetups to in-depth 1:1 meetings, I gathered actionable insights and transformed feedback into improvements that strengthened the project’s impact.\n\n15:07\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nmore my language, just fix it up and dno't change the feel too much:\nAt the UN's International Trade Centre (ITC), I led the development of a sustainable construction curriculum, connecting heritage architecture with modern green solutions and helping people take pride in local culture and practices to support post-conflict reconstruction.

At BLOOM, I built and led a platform that has supported 933 enterprises across 16 countries, running 118 accelerator cycles. This work involved developing comprehensive venture-building strategies, managing teams, and creating assessment frameworks that measure both venture growth and founder wellbeing - directly relevant skills for leading beVisioneers' three-year fellowship program.\n\nSecond, my experience bridges environmental innovation with local context. Most recently, at the International Trade Center in Iraq, I developed a sustainable construction curriculum that connected heritage architecture with green solutions. This project required managing diverse stakeholders, conducting 44 interviews, and engaging 36 organizations to create culturally-grounded learning pathways. This expertise in adapting sustainability initiatives to local contexts would be valuable for supporting beVisioneers fellows from various backgrounds and regions.\n\nThird, I bring deep experience in developing innovative learning methodologies. Through my work with UNICEF, Autodesk, and various international organizations, I've consistently created programs that empower young innovators to tackle complex challenges. My Master's in Sciences, Technology, and Health from the University of Paris complements this practical experience with theoretical understanding of sustainable innovation.\n\nImportantly, my track record shows not just program development, but successful implementation across challenging contexts.

      "content": "Let's answer this one:\n**How does your personal, professional and/or educational experience qualify you for this position? *** \nSince occupying Wall Street and the economic downturn of 2008, I have been working on building ecosystems of mutual support for positive innovation. Leveraging the availability of vacated factories, the free time of the newly unemployed, and the momentum of the open-source movement, the idea emerged to create the world and jobs we wanted ourselves, and to do it differently. To do it together, sharing resources, ideas, tools, rent, etc. This shift in expecting a future pathway to be determined by external, larger power structures, corporates or govornments, to a grassroots movement creating communities of empowerment and sharing and building a future ourselves was foundational to my future thinking and career. During the Arab Spring I saw young people in the Middle East ask for the power structures to be toppled and changed. I thought this was the ideal time to suggest not a changing of power structures from the top, but the inversion of it by bringing grassroots organizing, community support, innovation and entrepreneurship to the Middle East. I started The Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative first, promoting and supporting the creation of innovation communities and spaces from Egypt to Nigeria and Iraq and beyond. Then in 2016, I realized the necessity for deeper support to leverage the innovation capacities and direct them towards social and ecological challenges, and Bloom was born.\n \nBloom has been innovating on building personal and professional growth pedagogies, supporting social entrepreneurs in building wellbeing and impact simultaneously. My masters degree on Post Traumatic Growth was a result of attempting to find the lessons learned working in Lebanon during the pandemic and the Beiurt Port Explosion. My question was centered around the question: when things get difficult, what are the ways that social entrepreneurs respond and what are the factors that lead to the different responses.

I’m excited to see how the knowledge, networks and methodologies at Bloom translate and to bring wellbeing and welldoing together at DO. Programs like *beVisioneers* are critical in a time when young people feel increasingly anxious about the future and can help them take the fear and transform it into planet-positive action.

Alongside developing systems for selection, disbursements that match learning goals and do not detract from a social entrepreneur's goals, I’ve designed pedagogies that integrate well-being with impact, informed by my Master’s research on post-traumatic growth, where I explored how social entrepreneurs sustain their efforts during crises. My problem-solving mind and love of people led me to facilitate workshops in Arabic in Mosul, run design-thinking programs with marginalized youth in Lebanon, and manage cross-cultural teams. Looking back I see I’ve always sought to build environments where people can thrive and grow.\nThe DO School feels like a beautiful next step where I can bring my experience in program design, grassroots organizing, and collaborative leadership to a team equally dedicated to creating lasting impact.

I'm eager to see how the knowledge, networks, and methodologies I've developed at Bloom can translate and to bring wellbeing and welldoing together at DO. Programs like beVisioneers are critical in a time when young people feel increasingly anxious about the future, helping them transform fear into planet-positive action. With my Iraqi ancestry, I know how often people think their only solution is to leave, yet I've seen firsthand how these programs can offer participants practical tools while fostering agency, belonging, and hope.\n\nAt Bloom, we've worked with 933 enterprises across 16 countries, running over 100 accelerator and sprint cycles and engaging hundreds of mentors to build communities of innovation and support. I've designed selection systems and learning-aligned disbursement processes that support social entrepreneurs' goals. Our pedagogies integrate wellbeing with impact, informed by my Master's research on post-traumatic growth, where I explored how social entrepreneurs sustain their efforts during crises. My problem-solving mind and love of people have led me to facilitate workshops in Arabic in Mosul, run design-thinking programs with marginalized youth in Lebanon, and manage cross-cultural teams. Looking back, I see I've always sought to build environments where people can thrive and grow.\n\nThe DO School feels like a beautiful next step where I can bring my experience in program design, grassroots organizing, and collaborative leadership to a team equally dedicated to creating lasting impact. I'm eager to leverage the lessons, networks, and systems I've developed to help DO expand its reach and continue building a better future.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with DO's mission and this role.\n\nWarm regards,\nBilal Ghalib\n</antArtifact>\n\nKey improvements:\n- Standardized formatting and spacing\n- Fixed minor grammatical issues\n- Made organization names consistent (DO School/DO)\n- Improved flow between paragraphs\n- Maintained your personal voice and key examples\n- Kept the warm, authentic tone while enhancing professionalism\n\nWould you like me to adjust anything further?",
