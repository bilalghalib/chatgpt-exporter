Whether powered by a rotary engine, a V8 swap, or an imagined fighter jet turbine, the Miata remains the canvas for car enthusiasts worldwide.\"\nLLMs tend to have an identifiable writing style.\nThis is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles and drafts. It is meant to act as a field guide to help detect undisclosed AI-generated content on Wikipedia, but some of its advice can be broadly applicable. This list is descriptive, not prescriptive; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not belong on this page.\n\nIn particular, this list is not a blanket ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation; no one is taking your em-dashes away. Nor is it a claim that only LLMs use them. Not all text featuring the following indicators is AI-generated, as the large language models that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, especially on Wikipedia.\n\nThe patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more serious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently tidied up), those surface defects might not be present, but the deeper problems likely will. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content and Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.\n\nThe speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in § Communication intended for the user and the other two in § Citations. The other signs, though they may indeed indicate AI use, are not sufficient for speedy deletion.\n\nDo not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated, as they are unreliable. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have high error rates and cannot replace human judgment.\n\nLanguage and tone\nShortcuts\nWP:AIWTW\nWP:AI-ISM\nUndue emphasis on symbolism and importance\nWords to watch: is/stands as/serves as a testament, plays a vital/significant role, underscores its importance, continues to captivate, leaves a lasting impact, watershed moment, key turning point, deeply rooted, profound heritage, steadfast dedication, stands as a, solidifies ...\nLLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter with reminders that it represents or contributes to a broader topic. There seems to be only a small repertoire of ways that it writes these reminders, so if they are otherwise appropriate it would be best to reword them anyway.\n\nWhen talking about biology (e.g. when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to put too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist.\n\nExamples\n\nDouera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture. With its coastal charm and convenient location, Douera captivates both residents and visitors alike[...]\n— From this revision to Douéra\nBerry Hill today stands as a symbol of community resilience, ecological renewal, and historical continuity. Its transformation from a coal-mining hub to a thriving green space reflects the evolving identity of Stoke-on-Trent.\n— From Draft:Berry Hill, Stoke-on-Trent\nPromotional language\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Puffery.\nShortcuts\nWP:AIPUFFERY\nWP:AIPEACOCK\nWords to watch: rich cultural heritage, rich history, breathtaking, must-visit, must-see, stunning natural beauty, enduring/lasting legacy, rich cultural tapestry, nestled, in the heart of  ...\nLLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered \"cultural heritage\"—in which case they will constantly remind the reader that it is cultural heritage.\n\nExamples\n\nNestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and a significant place within the Amhara region. From its scenic landscapes to its historical landmarks, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a fascinating glimpse into the diverse tapestry of Ethiopia. In this article, we will explore the unique characteristics that make Alamata Raya Kobo a town worth visiting and shed light on its significance within the Amhara region.\n— From this revision to Alamata (woreda)\nTTDC acts as the gateway to Tamil Nadu’s diverse attractions, seamlessly connecting the beginning and end of every traveller's journey. It offers dependable, value-driven experiences that showcase the state’s rich history, spiritual heritage, and natural beauty.\n— From this revision to Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation\nEditorializing\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Editorializing.\nWords to watch: it's important to note/remember/consider, it is worth, no discussion would be complete without, this article wouldn't exist without ...\nLLMs often introduce their own interpretation, analysis, and opinions in their writing, even when they are asked to write neutrally, violating the policy No original research. Editorializing can appear through specific words or phrases or within broader sentence structures. This indicator often overlaps with other language and tone indicators in this list. Note that humans and especially new editors often make this mistake as well.\n\nExamples\n\nA defining feature of FSP models is their ability to simulate environmental interactions.\n— From Draft:Functional-Structural Plant Models\nTheir ability to simulate both form and function makes them powerful tools for understanding plant-environment interactions and optimizing performance under diverse biological and management contexts.\n— From the same page\nIn this case, the whole sentence comprises an original opinion:\n\nThese partnerships reflect the company’s role in serving both corporate and community organizations in Uganda.\n— From Draft:GEOWISE MEDIA\nOveruse of certain conjunctions\nWords to watch: on the other hand, moreover, in addition, furthermore ...\nWhile human writing obviously contains connecting words and phrases, LLMs tend to overuse them, in a stilted, formulaic way. This is often a byproduct of an essay-like structure that implies synthesis of facts, which is typical of LLM writing but inappropriate for Wikipedia.\n\nExamples\n\nAI-generated example\nCompare the above with below human-written prose. Even disregarding the absence of buzzwords and general vapidness, the connecting phrases in the below excerpt are more varied and less conspicuous.\n\nHuman-written example\nSection summaries\nShortcuts\nWP:CONCLUSION\nWP:INCONCLUSION\nWords to watch: In summary, In conclusion, Overall ...\nLLMs will often end a paragraph or section by summarizing and restating its core idea.[1] While this may be permitted for some scholarly writing, proper Wikipedia writing typically never summarizes the general idea of a block of article text (besides the lead section being a summary of the entire article).\n\nExamples\n\nIn summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.\n— From this revision in Nurse scientist\nOutline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects\nWords to watch: Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook ...\nMany LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a \"Challenges\" section, which typically begins with a sentence like \"Despite its [positive/promotional words], [article subject] faces challenges...\" and ends with either a positive assessment of the article subject, or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject. Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for \"Future Prospects.\"\n\nNote: This sign is about the rigid formula above, not simply the mention of challenges.\n\nExamples\n\nDespite its industrial and residential prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including[...] With its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of the Ambattur industrial zone, embodying the synergy between industry and residential living.\n— From this revision to Korattur\nDespite its success, the Panama Canal faces challenges, including[...] Future investments in technology, such as automated navigation systems, and potential further expansions could enhance the canal’s efficiency and maintain its relevance in global trade.\n— From this revision to Panama Canal\nDespite their promising applications, pyroelectric materials face several challenges that must be addressed for broader adoption. One key limitation is[...] Despite these challenges, the versatility of pyroelectric materials positions them as critical components for sustainable energy solutions and next-generation sensor technologies.\n— From this revision to Pyroelectricity\nThe future of hydrocarbon economies faces several challenges, including resource depletion, environmental concerns, and the shift to sustainable energy sources. This section would speculate on potential developments and the changing landscape of global energy.\n— From this revision to Hydrocarbon economy\nOperating in the current Afghan media environment presents numerous challenges, including the safety of journalists and financial constraints due to the Taliban's restrictions on independent media. Despite these challenges, Amu TV has managed to continue to provide a vital service to the Afghan population​​.\n— From this revision to Amu Television\nNegative parallelisms\nShortcut\nWP:AIPARALLEL\nParallel constructions involving \"not\", \"but\", or \"however\" such as \"Not only ... but ...\" or \"It is not just about ..., it's ...\" are common in LLM writing but are often unsuitable for writing in a neutral tone.[2] Examples\n\nSelf-Portrait by Yayoi Kusama, executed in 2010 and currently preserved in the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence, constitutes not only a work of self-representation, but a visual document of her obsessions, visual strategies and psychobiographical narratives.\n— From this revision to Self-portrait (Yayoi Kusama)\nIt’s not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it’s part of the aggression and atmosphere.\n— From this revision to Draft:Critikal! The Rapper\nHere is an example of a negative parallelism across multiple sentences:\n\nHe hailed from the esteemed Duse family, renowned for their theatrical legacy. Eugenio's life, however, took a path that intertwined both personal ambition and familial complexities.\n— From this revision to Eugenio Duse\nSome parallelisms may follow the pattern of \"No ..., no ..., just ...\":\n\nThere are no long-form profiles. No editorial insights. No coverage of her game dev career. No notable accolades. Just TikTok recaps and callouts.\n— From Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lilly Contino\nRule of three\nLLMs overuse the 'rule of three'—\"the good, the bad, and the ugly\". This can take different forms from \"adjective, adjective, adjective\" to \"short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase\".[2]\n\nWhile the 'rule of three', used sparingly, is common in creative, argumentative, or promotional writing, it is less appropriate for purely informational texts, and LLMs often use this structure to make superficial analyses appear more comprehensive.\n\nExamples\n\nThe Amaze Conference brings together global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers to discuss the latest trends in digital marketing. The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities.\n— From Draft:Amaze Conference\nSuperficial analyses\nWords to watch: ensuring ..., highlighting ..., emphasizing ..., reflecting ...\nAI chatbots tend to insert superficial analysis of information, often in relation to its significance, recognition, or impact. This is often done by attaching a present participle (\"-ing\") phrase at the end of sentences, sometimes with vague attributions to third parties (see below). These comments are generally unhelpful as they introduce unnecessary or fictional opinions.\n\nExamples\n\nIn 2025, the Federation was internationally recognized and invited to participate in the Asia Pickleball Summit, highlighting Pakistan’s entry into the global pickleball community.\n— From this revision to Draft:Pakistan Pickleball Federation\nConsumers benefit from the flexibility to use their preferred mobile wallet at participating merchants, improving convenience.\n— From Draft:MyanmarPay MMQR\nThese citations, spanning more than six decades and appearing in recognized academic publications, illustrate Blois' lasting influence in computational linguistics, grammar, and neology.\n— From this revision to Draft:Jacques Blois (linguist)\nThe civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.\n— From this revision to African-American culture\nVague attributions of opinion\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Unsupported attributions.\nShortcut\nWP:AIWEASEL\nWords to watch: Industry reports, Observers have cited, Some critics argue ...\nAI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called weasel wording—while citing only one or two sources that may or may not actually express such view. They also tend to overgeneralize a perspective of one or few sources into that of a wider group.\n\nExamples\n\nHere, the weasel wording implies the opinion comes from an independent source, but it actually cites Nick Ford's own website.\n\nHis [Nick Ford's] compositions have been described as exploring conceptual themes and bridging the gaps between artistic media.[a]\n— Draft:Nick Ford (musician)\nDue to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Efforts are ongoing to monitor its ecological health and preserve the surrounding grassland environment, which is part of a larger initiative to protect China’s semi-arid ecosystems from degradation.\n— From this revision to Haolai River\n \"About\". Nick Ford. Retrieved 2025-06-25.\nFalse range\nShortcuts\nWP:FROMXTOY\nWP:FALSERANGE\nWhen giving examples of items within a set, AI chatbots will often mention these items within a phrase that reads \"from ... to ...\", which often results in a non-encyclopedic tone. This indicator is not to be confused with the prepositions' non-figurative usage, such as in spatial or temporal contexts (e.g. \"... went from Chicago to Los Angeles\", \"... the library will be closed from Friday to Wednesday\").\n\nExamples\n\nThe essential components that form the foundation of Somali dishes encompass staples like rice and pasta, along with an extensive selection of meats ranging from lamb to beef and chicken.\n— From this revision to Somali people\nOur journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars that forge the elements of life, to the enigmatic dance of dark matter and dark energy that shape its destiny.\n\n[...]\n\nIntelligence and Creativity: From problem-solving and tool-making to scientific discovery, artistic expression, and technological innovation, human intelligence is characterized by its adaptability and capacity for novel solutions.\n\n[...]\n\nContinued Scientific Discovery: The quest to understand the universe, life, and ourselves will continue to drive scientific breakthroughs, from fundamental physics to medicine and neuroscience.\n— From Draft:The Cosmos Unveiled: A Grand Tapestry of Existence\nStyle\nTitle case in section headings\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters § Headings, headers, and captions.\nShortcut\nWP:AITITLECASE\nIn section headings, AI chatbots strongly tend to consistently capitalize all main words (title case).[2]\n\nExamples\n\nEarly Life and Education\nThomas was born in Cochranville, Pennsylvania. [...]\n\nApplications in Racing\nThomas’s behavioral profiling has been used to evaluate Kentucky Derby [...]\n\nGlobal Consulting\nThomas’s behavioral profiling has been used to evaluate Kentucky Derby and Breeders’ Cup contenders.

Thomas\nExcessive use of boldface\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting § Boldface.\nShortcut\nWP:AIBOLD\nAI chatbots may display various phrases in boldface for emphasis in an excessive, mechanical manner. One of their tendencies, inherited from readmes, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a \"key takeaways\" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.\n\nExamples\n\nIt blends OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and visual strategy tools such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC). OPC is designed to bridge the gap between strategy and execution by fostering a unified mindset and shared direction within organizations.\n— From Draft:One Page 4 Change (OPC)\nLists\nShortcut\nWP:AILIST\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists § Use prose where understood easily.\nAI chatbots often organize the contents of their responses into lists that are formatted in a particular way.\n\nLists that are copied and pasted from AI chatbot responses may retain their original formatting. Instead of proper wikitext, a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as 1.) instead of standard wikitext.\n\nExamples\n\n1.

LLMs especially tend to use em-dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking \"punching up\" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.\n\nThis sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself.\n\nExamples\n\nElwandore is a virtual micronation for people with passion and skill — a place to build, to create, and to help each other grow while chasing wealth. But not wealth for greed — wealth to give, to help others, to donate.\n— From this version of Draft:United Digital Republic Of Elwandore\nThe term “Dutch Caribbean” is not used in the statute and is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people of the autonomous countries themselves. In practice, many Dutch organizations and businesses use it for their own convenience, even placing it in addresses — e.g., “Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean” — but this only adds confusion internationally and erases national identity. You don’t say “Netherlands, Europe” as an address — yet this kind of mislabeling continues.\n— From this revision to Talk:Dutch Caribbean\nCurly quotation marks and apostrophes\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Quotation characters, and Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Apostrophes.\nShortcut\nWP:AICURLY\nAI chatbots typically use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks (\"...\" or '...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’; the same character as the curly right single quotation mark) instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in contractions and possessive forms. They may also do this inconsistently.\n\nCurly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. Microsoft Word as well as macOS and iOS devices have a \"smart quotes\" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as LanguageTool may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like Citer may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,\n\nMcClelland, Mac (2017-09-27). \"When 'Not Guilty' Is a Life Sentence\". The New York Times.

It may also pair it with text about what that information \"likely\" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely speculative (including the very claim that it's \"not documented\") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated. It is also frequently combined with the tells above.\n\nExamples\n\nWhile specific information about the fauna of Studniční hora is limited in the provided search results, the mountain likely supports...\n— From this revision to Studniční hora\nThough the details of these resistance efforts aren't widely documented, they highlight her bravery...\n— From this revision to Throwing Curves: Eva Zeisel\nNo significant public controversies or security incidents affecting Outpost24 have been documented as of June 2025.\n— From Draft:Outpost24\nAs of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about the current status or developments related to the \"Chester Mental Health Center\" in today's era.\n— From this revision to Chester Mental Health Center\nBelow is a detailed overview based on available information:\n— From Draft:The Good, The Bad, The Dollar Menu 2\n not unique to AI chatbots; is produced by the {{as of}} template\nPrompt refusal\nWords to watch: as an AI language model, as a large language model, I'm sorry ...\nOccasionally, the AI chatbot will decline to answer a prompt as written, usually with an apology and a reminder that it is \"an AI language model\".

Outright refusals have become increasingly rare.\n\nPrompt refusals are obviously unacceptable for Wikipedia articles, but some users do include them.

As wikitext is mostly tied to a specific platform using a specific software (a wiki running on MediaWiki), it is a niche markup language, lacking wider exposure beyond Wikipedia and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze. As such, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data—while the corpuses of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.\n\nWhen asked about its \"formatting guidelines\", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions will typically disclose some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-2025):\n\n## Formatting Guidelines\n\n- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.  \n- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).  \n- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences, ≤150 words).  \n- Break large topics into labeled subsections.  \n- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.  \n- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.  \n- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.  \n- Use horizontal dividers (`---`) between major sections.  \n- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.  \n- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.  \n- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.  \n- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.  \nAs the above already suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.\n\nEven when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their inherent architectural biases and training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told by a user to \"generate an article\", a chatbot will typically default to using Markdown for the generated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed by a user to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might itself \"realize\" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)?[a][dead link] in its output. If told to proceed, the resulting syntax will often be rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style fenced code block (its syntax for WP:PRE) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: ```wikitext.[b]\n\nThe presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Slack. Some writing tools and apps, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, may support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.\n\nExamples\n\nSee also: Markdown § Examples\nI believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am \"not here to build an encyclopedia\". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments \"AI-generated\" — without explaining how they are substantively flawed.\n— From this revision to a user talk page\n- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the \"Cyberhero League\" being recognized as a winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the interview with THE FUTURIST ([1](https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-interview-with-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)).

Most links become broken (see link rot) over time, but those factors make it unlikely that the link was ever valid.\n\nInvalid DOI and ISBNs\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see Wikipedia:DOI and Wikipedia:ISBN.\nA checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates will display a warning if so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinated references.\n\nRelated are DOIs that point to entirely different article and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.\n\nOhm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are \"ohmic,\" meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [2][3].\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.).

Worse, both Proceedings of the IEEE citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to completely different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, C. L. Fortescue was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and Vol 55, Issue 11 does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3.

The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference.

J. source – being the \"third source\" the tool presumably generated the link 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{cite journal}} reference, even though the links resolve.\n\nThe LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.\n\nFor over thirty years, computers have been utilized in the rehabilitation of individuals with brain injuries. Initially, researchers delved into the potential of developing a \"prosthetic memory.\"<ref>Fowler R, Hart J, Sheehan M. A prosthetic memory: an application of the prosthetic environment concept. ''Rehabil Counseling Bull''. 1972;15:80–85.</ref> However, by the early 1980s, the focus shifted towards addressing brain dysfunction through repetitive practice.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=R.

Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited and further responses will require the user to select \"continue generating\".\n\nThis method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.\n\nDiscrepancies in writing style and variety of English\nA sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.\n\nAnother discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[1] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should only raise suspicion if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\n\nAge of text relative to ChatGPT launch\nChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not particularly accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.\n\nIt is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated by an LLM. If an edit to a page was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some text added as far back as 20 years ago may appear to match some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.\n\nOverwhelmingly verbose edit summaries\nAI-generated edit summaries are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without abbreviations, and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.\n\nMost editors using AI do not ask for summaries to be generated.\n\nRefined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines. Removed promotional wording, ensured factual accuracy, and maintained a clear, well-structured presentation. Updated sections on history, coverage, challenges, and recognition for clarity and relevance. Added proper formatting and categorized the entry accordingly\n— Edit summary from this revision to Khaama Press\nI formalized the tone, clarified technical content, ensured neutrality, and indicated citation needs. Historical narratives were streamlined, allocation details specified with regulatory references, propagation explanations made reader-friendly, and equipment discussions focused on availability and regulatory compliance, all while adhering to encyclopedic standards.\n— Edit summary from this revision to 4-metre band",
