The script includes a \"talking pressure\" concept that triggers the agents to speak after a certain number of rounds. Please note that this is a basic implementation to help you get started, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific requirements.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nimport random\n\nload_dotenv()\n\nclass ChatAgent:\n    def __init__(self, name, role, description, contact=None, api_key=None):\n        self.name = name\n        self.role = role\n        self.description = description\n        self.contact = contact\n        self.api_key = api_key\n        self.talking_pressure = 0\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name} - {self.role}: {self.description}\"\n\n    def respond(self, conversation_rounds):\n        self.talking_pressure += 1\n        if self.talking_pressure >= conversation_rounds:\n            # Connect to API and generate a response\n            # response = generate_response(self.api_key)\n            response = f\"{self.name} responds.\"\n            self.talking_pressure = 0\n            return response\n        return None\n\ndef load_agents_from_env():\n    agent_names = os.environ['AGENT_NAMES'].split(',')\n    agents = []\n\n    for name in agent_names:\n        role = os.environ[f'{name}_ROLE']\n        description = os.environ[f'{name}_DESCRIPTION']\n        contact = os.environ.get(f'{name}_CONTACT', None)\n        api_key = os.environ.get(f'{name}_API_KEY', None)\n        agent = ChatAgent(name, role, description, contact, api_key)\n        agents.append(agent)\n\n    return agents\n\ndef main():\n    agents = load_agents_from_env()\n    conversation_rounds = int(os.environ['CONVERSATION_ROUNDS'])\n\n    for agent in agents:\n        print(agent)\n\n    conversation_history = []\n\n    for _ in range(10):\n        for agent in agents:\n            response = agent.respond(conversation_rounds)\n            if response:\n                conversation_history.append(response)\n\n    print(\"\\nConversation history:\")\n    for msg in conversation_history:\n        print(msg)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nFor this script to work, you'll need to create a .env file that defines the different characters, their roles, descriptions, contact details (if they are real people), API keys (if they use an API), and the number of conversation rounds before they should speak. Here's an example .env file:\n\n```\nAGENT_NAMES=JohnDoe,JaneDoe,AI_1\nCONVERSATION_ROUNDS=2\n\nJohnDoe_ROLE=Manager\nJohnDoe_DESCRIPTION=Experienced manager with a focus on efficiency.\nJohnDoe_CONTACT=johndoe@example.com\n\nJaneDoe_ROLE=Designer\nJaneDoe_DESCRIPTION=Creative designer with a passion for innovation.\nJaneDoe_CONTACT=+1234567890\n\nAI_1_ROLE=Six Thinking Hats AI\nAI_1_DESCRIPTION=AI chat agent representing different styles of thinking.\nAI_1_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n```\n\nYou can modify the script and .env file to suit your needs and add more chat agents as required. The script demonstrates a basic structure for creating a conversational engine that can incorporate both AI chat agents and real people, with the talking pressure concept included.",

For example, to adjust the interrupt threshold for the BlackHat agent to 5, you would enter \"adjust BlackHat 5\".\n\nKeep in mind that this script is a basic implementation to help you get started. You may need to modify it to suit your specific requirements, such as incorporating APIs to generate more dynamic responses from the AI chat agents.",

The `ChatAgent` class creates agent instances, which are then used by the `load_agents_from_env()` function.

Locate the Graphviz installation directory, which is typically `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Graphviz2.38\\bin` or `C:\\Program Files\\Graphviz2.38\\bin`.\n2.
