      "content": "The customer is saying that the Oud oil they bought came in a very small vial (2 milliliters), and to test or experience the oil, it needs to be fully emptied or used. This makes returning it practically impossible because once the product is opened and tested, there’s no practical way to return it in its original form—unlike returning pants or a jacket, which can easily be repackaged and sent back unused or minimally used.\n\nAdditionally, they argue that there was confusion caused by the advertisement. They claim that the product they received does not match their expectations based on the advertised scent (\"barnyard, cheese, fecal, spicy smell\"), implying that they believe the fault lies in the description rather than their preference or choice.\n\nIn short, the reasons they can't ship it back are:\n\n- The vial is extremely small and requires full usage to test it.\n- Once tested, it's impossible to return in its original form.\n- They feel the misunderstanding comes from the product description itself, not their error.\n\nThey are essentially requesting consideration or a solution that does not involve sending back the item.",
