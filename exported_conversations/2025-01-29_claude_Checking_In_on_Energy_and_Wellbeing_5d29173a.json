            "extracted_content": "From Metrics to Meaning: \nCrafting a Garden of Real Impact\n“The means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.”\n—Martin Luther King Jr.\nPart I: The Moment That Changed Everything\nA few years ago, I was listening to the On Being podcast when I first encountered Father Greg Boyle’s story about Homeboy Industries—the largest gang rehabilitation program in the world. Mid-interview, someone asked Father Greg about his intentions for his work. He paused, then replied with disarming simplicity:\n“They’re my friends.”\nThat single line plunged me into a deep realization: I had been treating people—refugees, youth, marginalized communities—as a means to an end. Yes, the “end” was noble (jobs created, businesses launched, metrics hit), but the means were often confused between my own goals, funding, validation, and scale, hinged on chasing big stories and big numbers rather than authentic human connections. I suddenly felt clear about why I had this gnawing notion that there was a disconnect between me and my work, between measurements and meaning.\nI moved more permanently to Lebanon, driven less by strategy and more by trusting a deeper calling: to truly know and be known by the people I wanted to help. Over the following years, I cultivated friendships with refugees, ex-shoe shiners, and folks living on the street. Where once I saw \"targets,\" I began to see humans with full stories.\nThat shift changed everything. It was a moment that upended my understanding of social impact. I'd been on a whirlwind of philanthropic efforts—designing workshops, traveling to displacement camps, drafting frameworks for \"scaling impact\"—always with an eye on the next pilot or next data set.\nI felt a shock of recognition like someone had flicked on a light in a dark hallway. I realized that in my pursuit of \"doing good,\" I had been unconsciously adopting a worldview in which people became instruments for metrics: a new job created, a new training delivered, a new \"success\" story. But life is not a game, and people are not pawns. I was measuring and optimizing, yet I wasn't rooting. That single line—\"They're my friends\"—pierced me with its radical simplicity.\nAnd so I made a choice: rather than continuing my peripatetic rounds, I would anchor myself where I was needed. I put down deeper roots in Lebanon. This decision wasn’t “strategic” by typical standards; it didn’t promise massive scale on a graph. But it promised relationship—the kind that Father Greg spoke of. In stepping away from always “proving impact,” I rediscovered something I’d long neglected: the primacy of human connection over data.\n\nPart II: The Crisis in Social Impact\n My journey might sound personal, but it highlights a wider crisis pervading the social impact sector. As philanthropic and development organizations chase scale and efficiency, they often instrumentalize people in ways that mirror the very systems they aim to change. Microfinance, for instance, started as a way to empower the poor but has sometimes devolved into aggressive loan sharking that leaves borrowers trapped in debt.\n“How you do anything is how you do everything” - Zen saying\nI believe many of the problems the social impact space attempts to address are related to a deeply rooted materialist understanding of reality. This leads us to see nature as resources to extract and humans as units of labor. It's as if we're set a goal to drive from Los Angeles to New York, but instead, we're going from Los Angeles to Portland... Except we're driving a tank, so it doesn't matter if our goals and destination are any \"better\" - SDGs versus profit maximization. We're still going to tear up the road along the way.\n\"Bloom where you are planted.\" – Saint Francis de Sales\nNeoliberal Metrics Gone Wrong\nThe social impact world is rife with examples of good intentions gone awry when metrics are prioritized over people. Microfinance soared to fame with the Nobel Prize–winning idea of small loans to marginalized individuals. But as the industry ballooned, many MFIs aggressively enforced repayment quotas, leading to tragic cases of borrower suicides in India. The metric—repayment rate—trumped any humane consideration for the poor.\nIn Palestine, international agencies pour resources into \"job creation\" for refugees, touting the number of short-term positions funded. Meanwhile, the brutal oppression and daily violence inflicted on Palestinians is systemically downplayed, overshadowed by tidy employment statistics that ignore generational trauma. And after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, major NGOs rushed to build houses guided by donors' demands for visible outputs. Many of these homes later fell apart due to lack of community input.\nAcross the board, we chase faster gains, bigger numbers, more impressive ratios. But in conversation after conversation, I hear a deep unease from our colleagues in the impact space—a sense that in our obsession with impact, we are losing touch with the messy, relational reality of social change.\n\nPart III: A Different Way of Seeing\nFather Greg's words offer a radical challenge to the mechanistic worldview that pervades much of the social impact space. Friendship resists objectification—it requires presence and genuine empathy. Friendship isn’t about a goal in the future, it’s about a quality in the now. And friendship implies presence and empathy, refusing to hold a person at arm’s length while counting them in a tally.\nStereoscopic Vision: Both Eyes Open\nIn our quest to measure impact, we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. We lose sight of the other eye—the one that perceives emotional truth, moral complexity, the depth of human experience. Together, these two ways of seeing provide stereoscopic vision, revealing the nuances we'd otherwise flatten.\nIn our quest to measure impact, prove value, and access funds(often competitively with others in the “do good space”), we often use only one eye: the rational, data-aggregating perspective. The one that loves seeing charts, even if they don’t mean much.\nIn doing so we lose access to our other eye—the one that perceives intangible depth, emotional truth, moral complexity. Together, these eyes provide stereoscopic vision, enabling depth perception. Without it, we see the world in flat outlines, easily manipulated.\nEye One (Metrics and Tools): We do need numbers. They can guide resource allocation and demonstrate accountability.\nEye Two (Meaning and Relationship): This eye sees the humanity behind the metrics. It recognizes that calling out genocide might matter as much as any job statistic. It sees that building a genuine friendship can be the difference between short-lived success and lasting transformation.\n“Without two eyes, we cannot perceive depth.”\n-Facts\n\nPart IV: Crafting a Garden — A New Metaphor for Impact\nIn my work, I’ve long resonated with two metaphors: “craft” and “gardening.” Lately, I’ve combined them into “crafting a garden,” which captures the delicate balance between artistry and cultivation—between carefully shaping something and letting nature unfold.\n1. Crafting a Garden: The Overall Idea\nWhen you craft something—like a potter shaping clay—you rely on skill, attention, and care. You have an intuitive sense of when the clay yields and how it wants to form. You measure, but you also feel. Similarly, a gardener sets the right conditions—soil fertility, water, sunshine—then watches growth emerge. You cannot force a seed to sprout; you can only support its natural flourishing.\nCrafting a garden merges these ideas: we pay reverent attention to every interaction (the “craft” side), while recognizing natural growth cycles (the “garden” side). We create conditions for transformation but do not rigidly control it.\n2. The Shortfalls of Factory Logic\nFactory Mindset: Standardize, mass-produce, aim for uniform outcomes on a big scale.\nGarden-Craft Mindset: Embrace diversity, local nuance, and the unpredictable beauty of living systems.\nToo often, social enterprises act like factories, chasing immediate wins without building the fertile soil of community trust. The result is a quick burst of external success—numbers—but no lasting root structure.\n3. Lessons from Craftsmanship\nA craftsperson understands:\nAttentiveness: The material (clay, wood, community) has its own story, and you must listen.\nTiming and Rhythm: Rushing can ruin the piece; waiting too long can spoil it, too. In social impact, a sense of readiness is as crucial as speed.\nEmbrace of Imperfection: Beautiful creations often bear the marks of real process, just like communities might have unique “flaws” that are actually sources of resilience.\nThis echoes how a gardener might wait out certain seasons, prune carefully, or trust the cycles of growth. When we treat a community like a “crafted garden,” we’re letting them keep their selfhood while offering supportive hands.\nSuccess at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact—drawing goals, setting metrics—but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not?\nThink about a food forest versus a factory farm. The factory farm is always waiting for the harvest, measuring inputs against projected outputs. But in the food forest, every moment is successful—even the decaying leaves in winter are doing exactly what they should. It isn’t waiting for the apples; it’s alive and successful in every moment.\n\nPart V: The Crisis of “Faster, Cheaper, Bigger”\nLet's face it: many funders, donors, and boards prefer a \"faster, cheaper, bigger\" approach. They want to see hundreds of houses built or thousands of jobs created—now. Meanwhile, intangible realities like healing from trauma, building local leadership, or confronting injustice are harder to put in a bar chart.\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or build genuine relationships—as Father Greg does\n\nGenocide in Palestine: If we remain silent on the structural oppression, no number of short-term jobs will address the underlying violence.\nPost-Disaster Reconstruction: If we fail to partner intimately with the local population—crafting solutions together—our “efficiency” might yield broken or irrelevant structures in a year’s time.\nA gardener doesn’t force the seed to open by cracking it with a hammer. Instead, they ensure the soil is nutrient-rich, the sun and water are adequate, and the environment is supportive. Similarly, a craftsperson doesn’t just “shave wood faster”; they learn the wood’s grain to avoid splits and fractures.\nSustaining Long-Term Flourishing\nWhen we slow down to address deeper injustices or take time to build genuine friendships—like Father Greg—we plant seeds that can sustain growth for decades. Short-term “scale mania” might yield impressive stats but can erode deeper bonds and obscure systemic oppression, as we see in Palestine, India, or countless other contexts. Quick wins might spike the graphs but erode community trust. Scale without soul is just another form of “mental colonization.”\n\nPart VI: Crafting a Garden at Bloom — A Vision for Meaningful Work\nBloom can transform into being an organization that co-runs programs that aim to help people rediscover meaning in work and life. We used to focus on performance dashboards—like a factory. But now I’m proposing adopting the crafting-a-garden approach:\nPreparing the Soil (Community Readiness)\nInstead of imposing solutions, we spend time listening. We don’t just gather “user feedback.” We have conversations, learn local stories, and see what’s already happening under the surface.\nPlanting the Seeds (Inviting Co-Creation)\nWe collaborate with participants as partners. Instead of top-down “Here’s the solution,” we ask, “What do you envision?” We do not define “impact metrics” without them—we craft the shape together.\nTending the Garden (Sustained Support)\nLike a gardener who regularly checks moisture and weeds, we maintain ongoing relationships—coaching, reflection circles, genuine friendship. We honor participants’ autonomy and celebrate emergent growth.\nHarvesting and Sharing (Reflecting on Results)\nOf course we measure—numbers, surveys—but these metrics follow the meaning, not the other way around. We also gather stories, capturing the intangible transformations: self-confidence blossoming, communities forging new alliances, or entrepreneurs finding deeper alignment.\nOn the Edge of True Impact\nWhen we treat social impact as craft, we realize we can’t solve all problems overnight. But we can stand with communities in a lifelong posture of solidarity. We can name injustices rather than burying them under “neutral” data. In that naming, in that presence, we keep seeds of hope alive.\nImplications for Bloom:\nInstead of impact dashboards, focus on preparing the soil, planting the seeds of co-creation, and tending the garden through sustained support.\nReplace standardized programs with living apprenticeships that foster organic growth and transmission of wisdom.\nBuild technology to serve human connection, not replace it. Start with people, bring in tools only as the work demands.\nMeasure what matters: moments of meaning, quality of relationships, community vitality. Track transformation through storytelling and direct presence.\n\nWhat This Means for Our Work\nInstead of our current approach—dashboards, hockey stick projections, assessment tools—we could build like craftspeople:\nFrom Programs to Practice Spaces\nReplace fixed curriculum with living apprenticeship\nCreate conditions for natural emergence\nSupport direct transmission of wisdom\nLet timing follow organic development\nFrom Tools to Relationships\nBuild technology only when we truly have to\nStart with calling people, connecting them, figuring things out\nOnly add systems when the human work demands it\nLet tools serve connection, not replace it\nQuality recognition requires human presence\nLet technology serve connection, not replace it\nFocus on Depth Over Breadth\nBetter to work deeply with a few than superficially with many\nTrust that quality spreads naturally\nLet impact emerge from meaning\nMeasure What Matters\nTrack moments of real connection\nNotice where quality recognition develops\nDocument authentic transformation\nLet patterns emerge naturally\nThe future isn’t in better automation or control systems—it’s in better supporting our natural capacity to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true. Everything else follows from that.\nMaking Measurement Serve Life\nHere’s what this could look like:\nInstead of measuring:\nPlatform engagement\nGrowth projections\nImpact metrics\nResource utilization\nWe measure:\nMoments of meaning\nQuality of relationships\nWisdom transmission\nCommunity vitality\nThe key isn’t just changing what we measure, but how we measure: through direct relationship, story, observation, and community, not just data extraction.\n\nA Different Kind of Economy\nThis isn’t about rejecting markets or metrics entirely. It’s about putting them in service of life. We need approaches that honor both our rational faculties and our ability to perceive meaning. When we do this:\nQuality naturally reduces waste\nRelationship naturally builds resilience\nMeaning naturally guides growth\nBeauty naturally creates value\nWe can pioneer an economy that affirms our humanity rather than exploits it. Where craft and care matter more than extraction and scale. Where honoring the uniqueness of people and place generates abundance for all.\n\nPart VII: Calling Forth a New Paradigm\nA Different Way Forward\nWhy does a materialist approach lead to so many issues? Because it fundamentally doesn’t acknowledge that humans have access to goodness within them and therefore must be controlled. The world is scary, so we need more knowledge, more science, more data, more control to put it under our command is the answer, although there is much we don’t know and this statement itself is full of hubris.\n\nThe unwritten belief is that life is nasty brutish and short (Hobbes), we can only know our mind and the world is “out there”(Descartes), the out there world is described by mathematics (Galileo), evolution describes our behavior (Darwin) and it’s survival of the fittest. These understandings lead to seeing people as mechanistic objects that can be tracked, manipulated, and controlled. That those who are smart and kind need to enact systems of control that ensure we don’t have the 30 years war again, and religion is bad, BTW, so is God and spirituality and all the stuff that probably led up to all the violence. The issue is the baby we threw out with the bathwater is the thing that gives us access to intuitive knowledge(which is a form of knowledge), insight, meaning, access to quality, goodness, truth, beauty, and knowing it when we see it. It closed one of our eyes.\nWeaving it Together: The examples of Buurtzorg and Sounds True illustrate how we might live out the principles of the crafted garden in our organizations. By privileging quality over control and wisdom over sheer scale, these pioneers point toward a new paradigm—one that the social impact world desperately needs.\nGrounding the Vision: What could this look like in practice? Imagine a social enterprise that apprentices local youth in green building, teaching both technical and relational skills. They construct eco-homes not through a cookie-cutter blueprint, but by truly understanding the landscape and the community's dreams. The organization tracks not just houses built, but the confidence and leadership that blossoms in the youth. Funders receive not just data points, but rich stories of transformation. This is impact with the intimacy of a garden and the integrity of a well-crafted structure.\nI’ve had deep doubts about the social impact space, especially after reading Winners Take All and realizing that what we’re doing isn’t what we’re talking about. We’re not saving the world—we’re helping people find community, develop confidence, learn, grow, find agency. We’re not even really helping them establish financially successful exponential businesses, because we don’t embody that. We embody something that matters to many, yet we’re not clear about that. Instead, we pretend to sell other things, and that tension hurts.\nThis isn’t abstract theory—there are organizations showing a different way forward. Buurtzorg in the Netherlands eliminated all management and metrics-based control, trusting nurses to directly perceive and respond to patient needs. The result? Better patient outcomes, 40% lower costs, and the highest healthcare worker satisfaction in the country. Or Sounds True, which built a $60M publishing company by trusting both business acumen and deeper wisdom, proving that spiritual values can drive real success.\nThese aren’t just nice stories—they point toward a fundamentally different way of working that honors quality recognition and craft. When I say craft, I don’t just mean artisanal products. I mean any work that:\nDevelops through direct relationship and apprenticeship\nValues mastery and depth alongside innovation\nCreates containers for meaningful work to emerge\nTrusts people’s natural capacity to recognize quality\nSo how do we shift from metrics mania to crafting a garden?\nPractice Stereoscopic Vision\nKeep your metrics if they help you see part of reality. But never lose the second eye: the moral, relational, or spiritual dimension that sees goodness, truth, beauty and possibilities for friendship.\nName Reality Clearly\nAvoid euphemisms. If it’s genocide, call it genocide. If microfinance turns exploitative, say so openly. Authentic relationships thrive on honesty, not polite obfuscation.\nSlow Down to Go Deeper\nSlowing the pace allows you to “listen to the clay,” to sense a community’s soul. Rushing might create short-term outputs but often yields shallow or harmful outcomes.\nTrust the Process of Craft\nAccept that not everything can be a linear blueprint. Gardening has seasons; some seeds fail. Craft has trial and error; sometimes the material cracks. This is growth, not a series of guaranteed leaps.\nAdopt the Gardener’s Long View\nA gardener invests in the soil, knowing real harvests may come years later—or bless future generations. In social impact, facing crises that range from genocide to climate disasters, we must hold a long-range vision. Even small acts of genuine friendship, alignment with our perception of beauty, can ripple beyond our immediate horizon.\n\nA Moment for Reflection\nWhat tension do you feel when pressured for quick results?\nWhich relationships in your work might you deepen rather than “scale”?\nWhere might you stand in truth—calling out systemic violence or injustice—rather than quietly conforming to funder-friendly narratives?\nAsking these questions is an act of reclaiming our second eye—the one that perceives depth and moral texture. It’s a necessary counterpart to the first eye of data analysis.\n\nConclusion: Trusting the Seeds, Crafting the Garden\nFather Greg Boyle’s line—“They’re my friends”—remains a beacon for me. It teaches that relationship can’t be an afterthought. No matter how refined our metrics or how lofty our proposals, if we lose sight of shared humanity, we drift into the same mechanistic mindset we intended to oppose.\nCrafting a garden of social impact means:\nTending relationships like precious seedlings.\nUsing skilled, attentive “craft” to shape solutions with communities, cultivating the context in the present moment - anticipating the “impact” in the future like a gardener planting seeds in the spring hopes for tomatoes in the summer, yet can’t ensure it.\n\n\nThis is not an easy path. Gardens demand consistent care; craft demands repeated practice and humility. But it’s the only path I’ve found that truly integrates rational analysis with moral imagination. We don’t discard numbers—we simply refuse to make them our God. Instead, we combine metrics with love, data with empathy, and structure with spirit. That is the heart of stereoscopic vision—two ways of seeing that yield a deeper perception of reality.\nIn the end, what we grow—in ourselves and our communities—may far surpass the limited ambitions of simple “outputs” and “outcomes.” We may witness genuine healing, solidarity, and creative flourishing where once only a graph or a donor report existed. We may craft gardens so fertile with attention, compassion, and truth that entire communities not only survive but truly come alive.\nAnd that, I believe, is what real impact looks like.\n\nFinal Thought\nWhen we stand next to someone—whether a refugee, a farmer crushed by debt, or a family in Palestine facing daily violence—and say, “You are not my data point; you are my friend,” we enact the very transformation we hope to see in the world. We show that life isn’t a mechanical series of inputs and outputs, but a shared tapestry of stories, joys, and struggles.\nMay we all become craftspeople and gardeners of this new paradigm—humans who measure thoughtfully but love wholeheartedly, who plant seeds of change with skilled hands and open hearts, cultivating relationships that outlast any spreadsheet.\nConclusion: Success at Every Step\nWe keep planning for future impact, but what if success isn’t about reaching some future state? What if it’s about being successful at every step of the way? Think of a food forest—it’s successful in every moment, even in winter’s decay. It isn’t waiting for harvest to declare success. Similarly, real transformation emerges when we let quality recognition guide us at each step, rather than fixating on some distant “scalable” end.\n“We can’t take down the master’s house with the master’s tools. We need to trust in something deeper.”\nMaybe we start small, document what emerges when we trust this process, build evidence through real stories of transformation, and let the work speak for itself. We could become gardeners—crafting conditions for people to come alive—rather than assembly-line managers producing forced outcomes.\nI believe we can pioneer a different way of working: trust quality recognition first, build like gardeners, develop through relationship and practice, and measure only what truly serves beauty. This approach might feel risky, but it leads to more authentic impact—one that sustains people’s dignity and fosters real transformation.\nThat, in essence, is what I think social impact can be. By trusting the deeper capacity in all of us to recognize and move toward what’s beautiful and true, we can finally step beyond hollow metrics into the living reality of meaningful work.\n"

These mottos, while intended to inspire, can sometimes convey implicit belief systems that may inadvertently contribute to student stress or feelings of inadequacy. For instance, mottos emphasizing relentless pursuit of excellence or unwavering commitment to truth might set unrealistically high standards, leading students to experience pressure to conform to these ideals.\n\nHere are some examples of university mottos and their potential implications:\n\nHarvard University: \"Veritas\" (\"Truth\")\n\nImplication: An expectation to constantly seek and uphold absolute truth, which may lead to pressure to achieve intellectual perfection.\nYale University: \"Lux et Veritas\" (\"Light and Truth\")\n\nImplication: A dual emphasis on enlightenment and truth could foster a sense of duty to attain comprehensive knowledge, potentially overwhelming students.\nUniversity of California: \"Fiat Lux\" (\"Let there be light\")\n\nImplication: Encourages illumination and discovery, possibly instilling a belief that one must always contribute novel insights, which can be daunting.\nAmherst College: \"Terras Irradient\" (\"Let them illuminate the earth\")\n\nImplication: Suggests a responsibility to spread knowledge globally, potentially creating pressure to have a widespread impact.\nBrooklyn College: \"Nil Sine Magno Labore\" (\"Nothing without great effort\")\n\nImplication: Emphasizes the necessity of significant effort for success, which might lead to stress or burnout among students striving to meet this standard.\nThese mottos, while noble in intent, can implicitly promote belief systems that equate personal worth with academic achievement or societal contribution. Such implicit messages may contribute to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, or depression among students who struggle to meet these ideals.\n\nIt's important for educational institutions to recognize these potential implications and provide support systems that promote mental well-being, emphasizing that personal value is not solely determined by academic or intellectual accomplishments.\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ninteresting - i do feel like perhaps these are connected to some fundemental truths that universities started with that might be missing. I feel like schools are now undergone as an expectation that it will lead to a job although that is being questioned now. and the competition, grading on a curve, the rapidly increasing expense of schools, the elitism of elite schools and what it implies about \"non-elite\" etc - i'm curious what else might be assumed - maybe hard to see, or invisible till you point it out\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou're onto something. The experience of higher education has transformed over time, and many of the implicit belief systems that shape universities today are rarely questioned—until they lead to disillusionment or distress. Let's break it down into some of these hidden assumptions:\n\n1. Education = Credentialing, Not Learning\nImplicit Belief: A university degree is primarily a means to secure a job.\nEffect: The focus shifts from curiosity and intellectual growth to credentialism, reducing intrinsic motivation.\nManifestation: The pressure to optimize for grades, resume-building, and career networking rather than genuine engagement with learning.\n2. Success is Measured by Prestige\nImplicit Belief: The value of education is tied to the reputation of the institution.\nEffect: Students internalize a hierarchy where elite schools = superior individuals, creating self-doubt in \"non-elite\" environments.\nManifestation: Hyper-competition, imposter syndrome, and a sense of inadequacy even among high-achievers.\n3. Intelligence is a Fixed, Ranked Commodity\nImplicit Belief: Some people are just naturally smarter, and the university's job is to sort and rank them.\nEffect: Creates a scarcity mindset—if someone else succeeds, you fail. Encourages cutthroat competition and discourages collaboration.\nManifestation: Grading curves, weeding out classes, and harsh competition for internships and fellowships.\n4. The Myth of the Rational Meritocracy\nImplicit Belief: Universities reward the best and brightest fairly.\nEffect: Ignores systemic biases and personal circumstances that shape access to education and success within it.\nManifestation: Survivorship bias (only those who thrive are seen as \"deserving\"), lack of mental health support, and blind spots in accommodating diverse learning styles.\n5. You Must Specialize to Succeed\nImplicit Belief: Mastery of a niche is the path to success.\nEffect: Pressures students to commit early to a rigid career path, limiting exploration and interdisciplinary learning.\nManifestation: Fear of switching majors, anxiety about \"wasting time\" on non-career-relevant courses, pressure to always have a plan.\n6. Productivity = Worth\nImplicit Belief: Your value is determined by how much work you can produce.\nEffect: Overwork, burnout, and a deep-seated fear of slowing down.\nManifestation: The glorification of all-nighters, excessive coursework, and the pressure to be constantly achieving.\n7. School is a Rite of Passage, Not a Choice\nImplicit Belief: Everyone must go to university to be a functioning adult.\nEffect: Dismisses alternative paths (apprenticeships, self-directed learning, entrepreneurship).\nManifestation: Stigma around dropping out, undervaluing non-academic intelligence, and a lack of institutional support for students who don't fit the mold.\n8. Failure is Shameful, Not Part of Learning\nImplicit Belief: Failing a test or course is a personal failure, not a learning process.\nEffect: Encourages perfectionism, risk-aversion, and avoidance of challenging topics.\nManifestation: High levels of academic anxiety, reluctance to ask for help, and fear of standing out.\n9. Mental Health is a Personal Issue, Not a Structural One\nImplicit Belief: If students are struggling, it’s their fault, not the system’s.\nEffect: Blames individuals rather than addressing systemic issues like unrealistic workloads, financial stress, and social isolation.\nManifestation: Insufficient mental health services, stigma around seeking help, and a culture of silent suffering.\n10. Prestige is More Important Than Impact\nImplicit Belief: Publishing in top journals or landing a high-status job matters more than doing meaningful work.\nEffect: Discourages unconventional career paths that might be more fulfilling but less prestigious.\nManifestation: A fixation on Ivy League acceptance rates, top-tier consulting jobs, and chasing external validation over personal fulfillment.\nThese invisible assumptions often go unquestioned because they are embedded in the culture of universities and society at large. Once they are named, though, they become easier to resist and challenge.\n\nDo any of these resonate with you? Or do you sense any deeper assumptions lurking beneath these?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\n\"We live in a meritocratic society and if you're not successful it's your fault\" could be an interesting idea. \nCan we gather all universities that have mottos about light in their name?\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nMany universities incorporate the concept of \"light\" into their mottos, symbolizing enlightenment, knowledge, and the pursuit of truth. Here are several examples:\n\nUniversity of California: \"Fiat lux\" (\"Let there be light\")\nYale University: \"Lux et veritas\" (\"Light and truth\")\nUniversity of Oxford: \"Dominus illuminatio mea\" (\"The Lord is my light\")\nColumbia University: \"In lumine tuo videbimus lumen\" (\"In thy light shall we see light\")\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: \"Lux libertas\" (\"Light and liberty\")\nUniversity of Washington: \"Lux sit\" (\"Let there be light\")\nUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison: \"Numen lumen\" (\"God, our light\")\nDavidson College: \"Alenda lux ubi orta libertas\" (\"Let learning be cherished where liberty has arisen\")\nKalamazoo College: \"Lux esto\" (\"Be light\")\nUniversity of Vermont: \"Studiis et rebus honestis\" (\"Through studies and upright affairs\")\nUniversity of New Mexico: \"Lux hominum vita\" (\"Light of the life of mankind\")\nUniversity of North Dakota: \"Lux et lex\" (\"Light and law\")\nNortheastern University: \"Lux, veritas, virtus\" (\"Light, truth, courage\")\nMorehouse College: \"Et facta est lux\" (\"And there was light\")\nOhio Wesleyan University: \"In lumine tuo videbimus lumen\" (\"In your light we shall see the light\")\nSonoma State University: \"Lux mentis, lux orbis\" (\"Light of the mind, light of the world\")\nUniversity of Colorado: \"Λαμψάτω τὸ φῶς ὑμῶν\" (\"Let your light shine\")\nUniversity of Oregon: \"Mens agitat molem\" (\"Minds move mountains\")\nUniversity of Richmond: \"Verbum vitae et lumen scientiae\" (\"Word of life and the light of knowledge\")\nValparaiso University: \"In thy light we see light\"\nThese mottos reflect the institutions' dedication to illuminating minds and fostering enlightenment through education.\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ni'm looking to identify why universities and institutes of higher educaiton might make people depressed and i think it has to do with the belief systems that are implicity in the environment. What are those belief systems - even in a university that prides itself on reason etc? I want research that digs into the worldviews that universities operate under and how they result in the outcomes and a historic analysis showcasing how it changed from harvard being a divinity school to a school for elites \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nThe evolution of universities, particularly institutions like Harvard, reflects a significant shift in underlying belief systems that have influenced both their educational missions and the mental health of their students.\n\nHistorical Transformation of Harvard University\n\nFounded in 1636, Harvard began as a divinity school aimed at training Puritan ministers. Over time, it transitioned into a secular institution emphasizing academic excellence and societal leadership. This shift was marked by several key developments:\n\nSecularization and Expansion: In the 19th century, under President Charles William Eliot (1869–1909), Harvard expanded its curriculum and professional schools, transforming into a modern research university. Eliot's reforms included the introduction of the elective system, allowing students greater freedom in course selection, and a focus on academic rigor. \nEN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG\n\nRise of Meritocracy: In the mid-20th century, President James Conant (1933–1953) sought to democratize access to Harvard by promoting standardized testing and academic merit as primary admissions criteria. This move aimed to replace the existing social elite with a \"cognitive elite,\" reshaping the university's identity and societal role. \nTHEATLANTIC.COM\n\nImplicit Belief Systems and Student Mental Health\n\nThe transformation of universities has embedded certain implicit belief systems that can impact student well-being:\n\nMeritocratic Pressure: The emphasis on meritocracy fosters a belief that success is solely the result of individual effort and talent. Consequently, students may internalize failure as a personal shortcoming, leading to feelings of inadequacy and depression. \nTHEATLANTIC.COM\n\nSocial Exclusion: Competitive environments can lead to social exclusion, where students who do not meet certain academic or social standards feel marginalized. Research indicates that social exclusion is positively associated with depression among undergraduates. \nPMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV\n\nSecularization and Loss of Community: The shift from religious to secular education models has, in some cases, led to a diminished sense of community and shared purpose. The absence of a unifying belief system can contribute to feelings of isolation among students. \nDIGITALCOMMONS.LIBERTY.EDU\n\nConclusion\n\nThe historical evolution of universities like Harvard from religious institutions to secular, meritocratic entities has introduced implicit belief systems that may contribute to student depression. Understanding these underlying assumptions is crucial for developing support structures that promote mental well-being in higher education."

The shift from sacred to secular competition and meritocracy And there's others know, it's not just these. I think there's like a whole set of implications that I think arise from maybe, like, a few foundational, unquestioned assumptions about school. Right? Maybe one of them is that maybe this materialist interpretation that am a brain, and I am going to be able to understand the universe and that is the idea of light And I think maybe, like, it can be kinda interesting to, to talk about light Claude to see, like, what life used to mean, you know, in a lot of the model of universities, they're talking about lights and there's, this light bulb moment of having an idea, for and this brightness and this illumination, but I think there's something about you know, Claude, ideas and arrogance and knowledge and doing and the, difference between lights that you think is related to an individual putting in, like, quote, quote, hard work, and hard work pays off. And you go to college and you get a degree you get a job, and then you're successful. And Harvard and whatever. Right? Like, look at this person, Harvard and as if it means something. Right? But like, what is the light and how could that light have been seen in different eras and implied The kind of world view or cosmology or whatever the specific thing we're gonna be talking about, like, maybe we can do is just talk about you know, a motto of a university sort of like it's guiding quote. Right? And, I feel like with a broad idea, like, light and justice or something. Illumination and there's, like, this idea of also a path. Right?

And I think there's, like, some interesting things about these fundamental assumptions about, like, what is this light? And what is, you know, the enlightenment period, you know? And one of the things that I've begun to realize, and maybe there's research on this, Very specific thing, which is what is knowledge without a framework. Right? Like, when you have a framework, the knowledge fits into it. Right? And so it kind of reinforces structures, makes visible or even realities that aren't present. So you know, like, you go walking in a forest with someone who sees themselves as in relationship with trees and they will have a conversation. Right? And I was actually with an elder from the Pacific Islander communities and he immediately, when we arrived in Mexico, before feeling Permission to speak. Wanted to connect with the ancestors of the land and the people that honor wisdom traditions of this land and to get permission before speaking. And I don't think an educated Harvard Professor, would have that be top of mind. Right? So this idea of, you know, I think there could be some research that's very clear about how What we assume informs what we can know. It sort of related to epistemology Right? Maybe it is actually just an epistemological question about we know what we know. But I think it's a very interesting thing in this light. It's like, what do we think of as being discussed when we talk about Lights and mottos of universities. You know? And what path are we shining a light on? So MIT iOS a hyper competitive, engineering oriented school where techne or practicality is a, A value, a higher value that is socially, approved of And the idea of This school and what it does and what it assumes is good I think, will inform how people conceive of and take on Various Knowledges. Right? So someone that comes up with an idea within the context of MIT will probably very likely go and try to figure out how to commercialize versus ideas being for contemplation or And And this kind of, like, because we can attitude, and the history of the culture of, like, high you know, MIT graduates starting businesses, making lots of money, Kungkol, changing the world But with all of this change and with the increase in the number of people who are going through and trying to change the world We're seeing this speeding up and this inability for us to catch up and we're getting stressed out.

Maybe one of them is that maybe this materialist interpretation that am a brain, and I am going to be able to understand the universe and that is the idea of light And I think maybe, like, it can be kinda interesting to, to talk about light Claude to see, like, what life used to mean, you know, in a lot of the model of universities, they're talking about lights and there's, this light bulb moment of having an idea, for and this brightness and this illumination, but I think there's something about you know, Claude, ideas and arrogance and knowledge and doing and the, difference between lights that you think is related to an individual putting in, like, quote, quote, hard work, and hard work pays off. And you go to college and you get a degree you get a job, and then you're successful. And Harvard and whatever. Right? Like, look at this person, Harvard and as if it means something. Right? But like, what is the light and how could that light have been seen in different eras and implied The kind of world view or cosmology or whatever the specific thing we're gonna be talking about, like, maybe we can do is just talk about you know, a motto of a university sort of like it's guiding quote.

EXISTING RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:\n\nKey Researchers to Start With:\n* David Orr - On ecological education\n* Martha Nussbaum - On liberal arts and democracy\n* Peter Block - On belonging and community\n* Anthony Kronman - \"Education's End: Why Our Colleges and Universities Have Given Up on the Meaning of Life\"\n\n4. EVIDENCE OF THE PROBLEM:\n* Mental health statistics in higher education\n* Student engagement metrics\n* Post-graduation satisfaction studies\n* Studies on meaning and purpose in education\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Pull specific research papers from these authors that connect to our questions?\n2. Draft a series of linked questions that build from student experience to systemic issues?\n3. Create a framework connecting student wellbeing to educational worldviews?\n\nAlso, regarding student statements, we could examine:\n- \"When will I use this?\"\n- \"What's this worth for my GPA?\"\n- \"Which jobs can I get with this degree?\"\n- \"How do I stand out from others?\"\n\nHow would you like to proceed in organizing these elements for WHEN?",

While existing research has documented rising mental health challenges in university settings, less attention has been paid to how fundamental assumptions about education's purpose might influence student wellbeing.

Space and Time Structures\n\nPhysical Environment:\nUniversities typically structure space and time in ways that reflect deeper assumptions about learning. Classrooms with fixed seating facing forward assume knowledge flows in one direction. Library \"quiet zones\" suggest learning is primarily individual and cognitive. Even the separation of \"academic\" buildings from \"residential\" spaces implies learning happens in designated locations rather than throughout life.\n\nSurprising Questions:\n- What if students who treat education instrumentally actually engage more deeply with material because they see clear purpose?\n- How might \"inefficient\" spaces (like lounges and gardens) actually serve learning?\n- Could structured time blocks be protective rather than restrictive for student wellbeing?\n\n2. Assessment and Progression\n\nCurrent Practice:\nUniversities measure progress through grades, credits, and sequential course levels. This system assumes learning is linear, measurable, and comparable across students. The emphasis on individual assessment reflects assumptions about knowledge being personally \"owned\" rather than collectively held.\n\nUnexpected Considerations:\n- Might grade pressure actually motivate some students to engage more authentically with material?\n- Could competitive environments foster valuable resilience?\n- What if clear metrics provide security that enables deeper exploration?\n\n3. Faculty Incentives and Teaching Methods\n\nStructure:\nUniversities typically reward research output over teaching quality. Teaching evaluations focus on student satisfaction and completion rates. This reflects assumptions about education as content delivery rather than shared exploration.\n\nHidden Dynamics:\n- How might faculty research pressure paradoxically create more authentic learning opportunities?\n- Could student evaluations, despite their flaws, capture important aspects of learning we're overlooking?\n- What if specialized expertise actually enables rather than hinders holistic understanding?\n\nINTERVENTION POINTS & COMPLEXITIES\n\n1. Curriculum Design\n\nTraditional Approach:\nUniversities typically separate disciplines and sequence courses from \"basic\" to \"advanced.\" This assumes knowledge can be parceled and built systematically.\n\nPotential Interventions:\n- Integration of contemplative practices\n- Problem-based learning across disciplines\n- Community engagement requirements\n\nComplicating Factors:\n- Some students might find traditional structures more accessible\n- Integrated approaches might disadvantage certain learning styles\n- Professional requirements may necessitate specific sequences\n\n2. Student Support Services\n\nCurrent Model:\nUniversities often separate academic support from mental health services, reflecting mind-body dualism. Career services focus on job placement rather than life purpose exploration.\n\nPossible Interventions:\n- Holistic advisory teams\n- Meaning-focused career exploration\n- Peer support networks\n\nUnexpected Considerations:\n- Could specialized services actually provide better support?\n- Might some students prefer compartmentalized support?\n- How does cultural background affect service preferences?\n\n3. Assessment Methods\n\nTraditional Metrics:\nUniversities rely heavily on exams, papers, and grades to assess learning. This assumes knowledge can be demonstrated through specific outputs.\n\nInnovative Approaches:\n- Portfolio-based assessment\n- Self-reflection components\n- Collaborative projects\n\nChallenging Questions:\n- Could traditional testing provide valuable structure for some students?\n- Might alternative assessments create new forms of anxiety?\n- How do different assessment methods affect different student populations?\n\nEXPANDING OUR VIEWPOINT\n\nQuestions That Might Surprise Us:\n1. \"What if the instrumental view of education isn't the problem, but rather our assumption that it's problematic?\"\n2. \"Could the pressure to find 'meaning' in education actually create more stress than viewing it pragmatically?\"\n3. \"How might different cultural perspectives challenge our constitutive/instrumental dichotomy?\"\n4. \"What if institutional structures we see as problematic actually serve important functions we're missing?\"\n\nResearch Directions We Might Be Missing:\n1. Cultural Variations:\n- How do different cultural traditions view the purpose of learning?\n- Might our framework reflect Western biases about individual development?\n\n2. Economic Realities:\n- How do class backgrounds affect educational orientation?\n- Could instrumental views be more adaptive for some students?\n\n3. Developmental Perspectives:\n- How do student orientations naturally evolve during university years?\n- Might different orientations serve different developmental stages?\n\n4. Institutional Diversity:\n- How do different types of institutions serve different student needs?\n- Could a diversity of approaches be more valuable than a single \"ideal\" model?\n\nSYNTHESIS & IMPLICATIONS\n\nThis expanded analysis suggests several key insights:\n\n1. The relationship between educational orientation and wellbeing might be more complex than initially assumed. Some students might thrive with instrumental approaches, while others might find meaning-focused approaches stressful.\n\n2. Institutional structures might serve multiple purposes we haven't fully considered. What appears problematic from one perspective might be supportive from another.\n\n3. Cultural and economic contexts significantly shape how students approach education. Our framework needs to account for these broader influences.\n\n4. The goal might not be to shift all students toward a constitutive orientation, but rather to help them find an approach that serves their needs while supporting their wellbeing.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Develop research methods that account for these complexities?\n2. Explore how to create flexible institutional structures that support multiple orientations?\n3.

Rather than assuming we simply need more services or stress-management programs, what if we examine whether university structures and their underlying assumptions are themselves generating or amplifying these challenges?\n\nBelow is a preliminary mapping that outlines how current policies and practices (and the assumptions behind them) may affect student wellbeing. I’d love your input on whether these resonate with your institutions, and what further questions or ideas come to mind.\n\nPRELIMINARY MAPPING: CURRENT STRUCTURES & UNDERLYING WORLDVIEWS\nDOMAIN\tCURRENT STRUCTURE\tUNDERLYING ASSUMPTION\tPOLICY MANIFESTATION\tWELLBEING IMPACT\nONTOLOGICAL\n(Nature of Reality/Being)\tIndividual Assessment\n(Grades, rigid exams)\tStudents as isolated units; learning happens alone\tAnti-collaboration policies; strict anti-cheating rules; emphasis on individual grades\tSocial isolation, heightened anxiety, fear of failure\nFixed Class Schedules\n(50 min blocks, etc.)\tLearning happens in controlled time blocks\tRigid attendance policies; limited flexibility in scheduling\tDisconnection from natural rhythms, lack of reflection time, constant rushing\nDigital Learning Platforms\n(LMS & analytics)\tKnowledge is transferable content to be tracked\tFrequent quizzes, logins, data dashboards\tScreen fatigue, reduced human connection, “surveillance” stress\nClassroom Layout\n(rows facing lecturer)\tMind-body separation; teacher is source\tMinimal movement, lecture-dominant approach\tPhysical tension, passivity, less embodied learning\nEPISTEMOLOGICAL\n(Nature of Knowledge)\tStandardized Testing\n(MCQs, timed exams)\tKnowledge is measurable and comparable\tHigh-stakes tests, strict grading rubrics\tTest anxiety, reduced creativity, focus on rote learning\nPrerequisites\n(linear course sequences)\tKnowledge is hierarchical; must proceed stepwise\tCourse “chains,” gating of subjects\tFear of “falling behind,” rigid thinking, labeling of “smart vs. slow”\nCitation Requirements\n(APA, MLA, etc.)\tExternal authority is primary; lived experience is less valid\tStrict research guidelines, heavy emphasis on “expert sources”\tSelf-doubt, devalued personal insight, possible cultural alienation\nExpert Lectures\n(passive listening)\tKnowledge flows one way from expert to novice\tLecture halls, minimal student interaction\tReduced engagement, meaninglessness, “info dump” overwhelm\nAXIOLOGICAL\n(Nature of Value)\tGPA Systems\n(numerical ranking)\tWorth measured quantitatively\tGPA cutoffs, academic standing based on grades alone\tSelf-worth instability, performance anxiety, grade obsession\nCareer Focus\n(“Get a job” emphasis)\tEducation’s purpose is job prep & market success\tJob placement metrics, “ROI” language, internship mandates\tPurpose anxiety, sense that learning is a means-to-an-end\nPublication Emphasis\n(faculty & grad students)\tMeasurable output = value\tTenure-track demands, pressure to publish fast\tTeaching quality sidelined, stress on faculty & TAs\nRankings & Reputation\n(external metrics)\tSuccess = competition and standing\tAdmissions selectivity, resource allocation to “boost rank”\tPerpetual comparison, status anxiety, students seen as “inputs”\nKEY RESEARCH & REFERENCES\nReadings, B. (1996). The University in Ruins. (Analyzes how “excellence” rhetoric and market logic reshape university purpose)\nSlaughter, S. & Rhoades, G. (2004). Academic Capitalism and the New Economy.

(Method for uncovering how everyday practices reflect larger institutional assumptions)\nMcIntyre, K., et al. (2018). “Student Well-being in Higher Education: A Systematic Review.” Journal of Mental Health (Summarizes mental health trends in university contexts)\nNEXT STEPS & QUESTIONS FOR THE NETWORK\nIdentifying “the water we’re in”: Which assumptions or structures in the table resonate most with your experience? Are there other hidden assumptions that aren’t listed?\nLinking worldviews to wellbeing: How do we best document the ways these assumptions play out in student mental health, anxiety, and suicide risk? What existing data or research might help us draw clearer connections?\nContextual vs. systemic factors: How much of the wellbeing crisis is driven by external crises (climate anxiety, economic instability) versus internal institutional practices and worldviews? Where do these interact most?\nI’d love to hear your reflections or direct experiences. If you have existing data, pilot studies, or anecdotal examples, I’m compiling a shared resource library. Ultimately, we might move toward collaborative research—not to lay blame, but to surface new insights and test whether changes in structure or policy could improve student flourishing.\n\nPlease reach out with thoughts, questions, or examples from your campus. If there’s enough interest, I’d be happy to organize a working group or roundtable to develop next steps.\n\nWarmly,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title / Role / Institution]\n[Contact Information]\n\nHOW THIS CAN BE ADAPTED OR EXPANDED\nFocus on One Dimension: You might highlight only ontological structures if your network is especially interested in how students view themselves in relation to knowledge.\nAdd a “Possible Interventions” Column: If your group is ready for brainstorming solutions, you could add a column with early ideas (e.g., “community-based assessment,” “mindful scheduling,” “embodied learning activities”)—but it sounds like you want to stay open-ended.\nGather Survey Data: If you plan to do a cross-institution survey, you could adapt each row into questions that gauge students’ and faculty’s perceptions (e.g., “How strongly do you feel competing with classmates?” “Do you see your GPA as a reflection of your personal worth?”).\nThis draft aims to invite dialogue rather than prescribe fixes. It acknowledges that external factors (like climate collapse or economic conditions) also matter, but it stays focused on internal, structural factors we might actually change.\n\nLet me know if you want any further refinements, more references, or a deeper dive on methodology for researching these assumptions. I’m happy to expand as needed!\n\nTHREE GUIDING QUESTIONS FOR WHEN NETWORK\nAssumption Awareness:\nWhat assumptions (ontological, epistemological, axiological) are most pervasive in your institution, and how do they shape student behavior and stress?\n\nExternal vs. Internal Drivers:\nHow do we distinguish the effects of external crises (e.g., climate anxiety) from the pressures baked into educational structures (e.g., grading systems)?\n\nData & Collaboration:\nWhat existing data, surveys, or qualitative research could we share to better map these worldviews and their impacts on wellbeing? Is there interest in a joint research project to explore this further?\n\nFeel free to use or adapt any of the text, table, or references as you see fit. Good luck with your outreach to the WHEN community!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ncan you conduct research and expand our table and our references of ontology in education \nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nCertainly, expanding upon the ontological aspects of education can provide deeper insights into how foundational beliefs about the nature of reality influence educational structures and practices. Below is an enhanced table focusing on ontological assumptions in educational contexts, along with an updated list of references that delve into ontology in education.\n\nExpanded Table: Ontological Assumptions in Educational Contexts\nDOMAIN\tCURRENT STRUCTURE\tUNDERLYING ONTOLOGICAL ASSUMPTION\tPOLICY MANIFESTATION\tPOTENTIAL WELLBEING IMPACT\nNature of Learning Spaces\tTraditional Classroom Settings (fixed seating, front-facing desks)\tLearning occurs in structured, controlled environments; knowledge is transmitted from teacher to student.\tEmphasis on lecture-based instruction; limited collaborative spaces.\tMay suppress creativity and limit social interaction, leading to disengagement.\nAssessment Methods\tStandardized Testing\tIntelligence and understanding are quantifiable and comparable across individuals.\tImplementation of uniform tests; focus on measurable outcomes.\tCan induce anxiety, reduce intrinsic motivation, and neglect diverse intelligences.\nCurriculum Design\tDiscipline-Specific Departments\tKnowledge is compartmentalized into distinct, non-overlapping domains.\tRigid departmental structures; limited interdisciplinary courses.\tMay hinder holistic understanding and the ability to connect concepts across fields.\nStudent Identity\tIndividual Performance Metrics (GPA, class rank)\tA student's value is determined by individual achievements and rankings.\tCompetitive grading systems; awards based on individual performance.\tCan foster unhealthy competition, stress, and a fixed mindset.\nKnowledge Authority\tTextbook-Centric Learning\tAuthoritative texts are the primary source of truth; learning is about absorbing established facts.\tReliance on approved textbooks; discouragement of questioning established knowledge.\tMay limit critical thinking and discourage exploration of alternative perspectives.\nUpdated References on Ontology in Education\nKarpov, A.

Cosmology—how a culture understands the structure and meaning of the universe—can influence how education is framed (e.g., whether knowledge is seen as a means to an end or as a lifelong, relational process). Metaphysics—questions about the nature of being, reality, and existence—directly informs ontological, epistemological, and axiological assumptions in education.\n\nExpanded Table: Ontological, Cosmological, and Metaphysical Assumptions in Education\nDOMAIN\tCURRENT STRUCTURE\tUNDERLYING ASSUMPTION\tPOLICY MANIFESTATION\tPOTENTIAL WELLBEING IMPACT\nOntological: Nature of Learning & Knowledge\tKnowledge as a Commodity\tLearning is about acquiring information rather than transformation.\tEmphasis on standardized testing, memorization-based exams, and grade performance.\tDisconnection from intrinsic motivation; anxiety over performance rather than deep learning.\nOntological: Student Identity\tIndividual Achievement Focus\tStudents are isolated, competitive individuals navigating a zero-sum game.\tGPA-based ranking, limited cooperative assessments, career-focused metrics.\tStress, burnout, comparison anxiety, imposter syndrome.\nOntological: Structure of Reality in Education\tLinear, Fragmented Curriculum\tKnowledge exists in separate disciplines rather than an interconnected whole.\tDepartments siloed into rigid specializations with little interdisciplinary interaction.\tLimits systems thinking, discourages holistic approaches to learning.\nCosmological: Purpose of Education\tInstrumental View of Learning\tEducation is about productivity and economic utility, not personal or spiritual growth.\tFocus on career readiness, employability metrics, and job-placement statistics.\tAnxiety about the future, loss of meaning in education, existential uncertainty.\nCosmological: Relationship with the Universe\tAnthropocentric Model\tHumans are separate from the natural world; knowledge is about control and mastery rather than coexistence.\tNature is treated as an external subject rather than an integrated learning system.\tAlienation from ecological belonging, reduced environmental responsibility.\nCosmological: Perception of Time\tEfficiency & Acceleration Culture\tProgress is about speeding up learning rather than deepening understanding.\tFast-tracked degree programs, productivity-focused academic policies.\tBurnout, time anxiety, inability to engage with slow and reflective learning.\nMetaphysical: Reality of the Self\tMind-Body Dualism\tLearning happens in the mind; the body is secondary or irrelevant.\tSedentary learning structures, lack of embodied education.\tPhysical tension, stress, reduced engagement due to lack of movement.\nMetaphysical: Nature of Knowledge\tMaterialism & Empiricism\tOnly what can be measured is real; subjective, intuitive, and relational knowledge is dismissed.\tOveremphasis on STEM disciplines, devaluation of arts and humanities.\tLoss of creativity, undervaluing of emotional and social intelligence.\nMetaphysical: Learning & Spirituality\tSecular-Only Approach\tMeaning, wonder, and spiritual dimensions of knowledge are considered irrelevant.\tReduction of humanities funding, absence of contemplative studies.\tLoss of deeper meaning in education, sense of existential crisis among students.\nKey References on Ontology, Cosmology, and Metaphysics in Education\n1.

            "extracted_content": "Dear WHEN Network,\nI'm exploring a fundamental question about student well-being in higher education: What if our current challenges aren't just symptoms to be treated but outcomes of our institutional worldviews and structures? Rather than bringing in more well-being practices and efforts, we need to recognize and address the root causes. Increasingly, complex systems arise from cosmologies and schemas that open or close different affordances. That the results of our systems make sense, and rather than attempting to adapt a chaotic and complex system we don’t understand with interventions, we can/should work on foundational beliefs that allow the emergence of new pathways in a chaotic system from within stakeholders in that system. \nTo speak in simple words, what if students, faculty, and administrators had their worldview assumptions made clear, and to identify the consequences of those beliefs, and developed a “two-way” process of being and knowing that creates space for questioning and opening new worldviews (comprised of ontological, epistemological and axiological elements) which will allow for new ways to hold space.\nMore simply, perhaps, one question I’m holding that reminds me of what children ask when they’re exposed to algebra: “When am I going to use this?” - This makes me wonder if education is about usefulness… Is it an instrument? Or is it an end in and of itself? If it’s an end, I believe it will likely promote wellbeing. If it’s an instrument, it is likely to be an impediment. My theory is that if a university is believed to be a means to an end, it will attempt to be sped up(rush), delegated(cheating), or systematized (automate). Whatever we learn becomes something that we do not want to attend to, to be with, it is to be used and transacted - creating a me/it relationship with the world and preventing feelings of belonging. \nThis is why “What is a university for” is a well-being challenge. Instrumentalizing learning transforms self- and world understanding. A better question might be, how will this experience transform me? This leads me to wonder what beliefs we have and how they show up in our policies in higher education that promote an instrumental view of education. \nBelow is a preliminary mapping that outlines how current policies and practices (and the assumptions behind them) may affect student well-being and ecological belonging. I’d love your input on whether these resonate with your institutions and what further questions or ideas come to mind.\nThis framework examines three interconnected dimensions: how we understand reality (ontological), how we view knowledge (epistemological), and what we value (axiological).\nBefore I share the tables, I’d like to open with some guiding questions:\nGUIDING QUESTIONS FOR WHEN NETWORK\n1. Mapping Assumptions & Institutional Worldviews\n(How do implicit assumptions shape learning, wellbeing, and institutional structures?)\nIdentifying Core Assumptions:\nWhat assumptions (ontological, epistemological, axiological) are most pervasive in your institution, and how do they shape student behavior and stress?\nHow do these structures manifest in your institution? Do these assumptions make sense? What assumptions might we be missing?\nBesides ontology, epistemology, and axiology, what other foundational worldview perspectives need to be examined?\nCosmology & Metaphysics in Education:\nHow do implicit cosmological and metaphysical assumptions in higher education shape student experiences of meaning, belonging, and well-being?\nHow can institutions recognize and deconstruct their dominant worldview to allow for a more pluralistic approach to learning?\n\n2. Differentiating Internal vs. External Stressors\n(How do external global challenges interact with internal institutional structures to affect student wellbeing?)\nInstitutional vs. Societal Pressures:\nHow might we distinguish well-being impacts from external factors (climate anxiety, economic uncertainty) versus internal institutional structures (grading systems, competitive frameworks)?\nHistorical & Structural Evolution of Universities:\nHow important is the historical evolution of universities to our understanding? \nHow can we position higher education to be responsive to people’s questions today?\n\n3. Alternative Models & Transformative Practices\n(How can different educational models and artistic perspectives contribute to wellbeing and expanded worldviews?)\nExploring Alternative Learning Models:\nWhat educational models integrate alternative ontologies and cosmologies? How do they impact student mental health?\nWhat existing research or pilot programs at your institutions might help us better understand these relationships?\nThe Role of the Arts & Creative Practices in Learning and Wellbeing:\nWhat’s the importance of the arts in self, world, and social system (university) understanding?\nWhat are the features of the artistic praxis that open doors to well-being and different mindsets?\n\n4. Research, Data, & Collaboration\n(What frameworks and methodologies can help us investigate these issues systematically?)\nData & Collaborative Inquiry:\nWhat existing data, surveys, or qualitative research could we share to better map these worldviews and their impacts on well-being?\nIs there interest in a joint research project to explore this further?\nONTOLOGICAL (Nature of Reality)\nStructure\nUnderlying Assumption\nPolicy Manifestation\nWellbeing Impact\nFixed Learning Environments\nLearning happens in controlled spaces/times\nRigid schedules, standard classrooms\nDisconnection from natural rhythms, reduced embodied learning\nIndividual Assessment Focus\nStudent as isolated unit (Individual achievement)\nAnti-collaboration policies, competitive grading\nSocial isolation, comparison anxiety\nKnowledge as a Commodity\nLearning is about acquiring information rather than transformation.\nEmphasis on standardized testing, memorization-based exams, and grade performance.\nDisconnection from intrinsic motivation; anxiety over performance rather than deep learning.\nLinear, Fragmented Curriculum\nKnowledge exists in separate disciplines rather than an interconnected whole.\nDepartments are siloed into rigid specializations with little interdisciplinary interaction.\nLimits systems thinking, and discourages holistic approaches to learning.\n\nEPISTEMOLOGICAL (Nature of Knowledge)\nStructure\nUnderlying Assumption\nPolicy Manifestation\nWellbeing Impact\nStandardized Assessment\nKnowledge is measurable/comparable\nHigh-stakes testing, rigid rubrics\nTest anxiety, reduced creativity\nLinear Prerequisites\nKnowledge is hierarchical\nCourse sequences, major requirements\nFear of \"falling behind,\" fixed mindset\nExpert-Centered Teaching\nKnowledge flows one way\nLecture formats, minimal dialogue\nReduced engagement, meaninglessness\n\n\nAXIOLOGICAL (Nature of Value)\nStructure\nUnderlying Assumption\nPolicy Manifestation\nWellbeing Impact\nQuantified Achievement\nWorth measured numerically\nGPA systems, rankings\nSelf-worth instability, performance anxiety\nCareer Preparation Focus\nEducation as job training\nROI metrics, employment tracking\nPurpose anxiety, delayed fulfillment\nCompetition Emphasis\nSuccess as comparative standing\nSelective admissions, curved grading\nPerpetual comparison, status stress\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL/METAPHYSICAL (What sort of Universe are we in?)\nStructure\nUnderlying Assumption\nPolicy Manifestation\nWellbeing Impact\nInstrumental View of Learning\nEducation is about productivity and economic utility, not personal or spiritual growth.\nFocus on career readiness, employability metrics, and job-placement statistics.\nAnxiety about the future, loss of meaning in education, existential uncertainty.\nEfficiency & Acceleration Culture\nProgress is about speeding up learning rather than deepening understanding.\nFast-tracked degree programs, productivity-focused academic policies.\nBurnout, time anxiety, inability to engage with slow and reflective learning.\nMind-Body Dualism\nLearning happens in the mind; the body is secondary or irrelevant.\nSedentary learning structures, lack of embodied education.\nPhysical tension, stress, reduced engagement due to lack of movement.\nAnthropocentric Model\nHumans are separate from the natural world; knowledge is about control and mastery rather than coexistence.\nNature is treated as an external subject rather than an integrated learning system.\nAlienation from ecological belonging, reduced environmental responsibility.\n\n\nGathering Prerequisite Research Reading\nI’m starting to gather proposed research reading and am very grateful for your insights and suggestions here:\n\"The University in Ruins\" (Readings, 1996) - Analysis of how market logic transformed university purpose\n\"The Beautiful Risk of Education\" (Biesta, 2013) - Examines education as an existential process\n\"Student Well-being in Higher Education: A Systematic Review\" (McIntyre et al., 2018)\n?\n\n\nI'm compiling a shared resource library and would welcome your contributions, whether data, case studies, or observations.

            "extracted_content": "Alternative Methods for Inquiry\n1. Relational Deep Listening Circles\nRather than surveying individuals in isolation, we invite participants into small, trust-based dialogue groups (in-person or virtual). Each circle follows a guided inquiry with reflective prompts. These circles are facilitated using practices from Indigenous, contemplative, and dialogical traditions such as:\n\nWay of Council (Indigenous traditions) – Structured listening where each participant speaks from the heart without interruption.\nLectio Conversationalis (adapted from Lectio Divina) – Reading aloud passages or prompts, sitting with them in silence, and then responding in turn.\nPaired Dialogue – Deep one-on-one listening where one person speaks for an extended period while the other fully listens before switching.\nSample Deep Listening Prompts:\n\nShare a moment in your education that felt most alive and connected. What was happening? What made it different?\nHow do you understand your relationship to knowledge? Does it feel like something you own? Borrow? Receive? Create together?\nHow do you experience time in your learning? Does time feel like a resource to manage, or a flow to move with?\nWhere do you feel most at home in your university? Where do you feel most out of place?\nIf learning was not about progress, achievement, or career, what would it be about for you?\nData Collection Alternative:\nRather than \"collecting responses,\" these circles could be recorded (with consent), transcribed, and analyzed narratively for common themes and patterns.\n\n2. Experiential Inquiry: Mapping the University Through Movement & Sensory Experience\nInstead of asking people about their educational experiences verbally, we invite them into embodied, artistic, and spatial reflection exercises that reveal deeper relationships between self, space, and knowledge.\n\nMethods:\n\nCampus Mapping Walks: Students walk through campus, marking places where they feel most connected and most disconnected to learning.\nPrompt: “Move through your campus and notice where you feel a sense of belonging, aliveness, or resistance. What do you notice?”\nBody Mapping of Learning: Participants draw a map of their body in relation to learning. Where do they feel learning resides? In the head? The heart? The hands?\nPrompt: “Draw a representation of how learning moves through your body. Where does it settle? Where does it get stuck?”\nRituals of Unknowing: A space is created where students practice letting go of the need for certainty, experiencing knowledge as fluid.\nExercise: Sitting in silence with a paradoxical or poetic question:\n“What if learning was not about knowing more but becoming more?”\n“What does it mean to learn with a river? A tree? A piece of music?”\nData Collection Alternative:\nThese maps, movements, and experiences are shared in a group debrief or captured visually and textually, forming a qualitative landscape of learning rather than a dataset.\n\n3. Relational Interviews: Knowledge as Emergent in Conversation\nInstead of treating each participant as an isolated \"data point,\" we frame interviews as shared explorations. The interviewer is also a participant in the meaning-making.\n\nSample Open Questions for Relational Interviews:\n\n“If your university was a living being, what kind of being would it be? How does it treat its students, knowledge, and time?”\n“When have you felt that knowledge was something sacred or alive?”\n“If learning was not about accumulation or progress, what would it be about?”\n“Describe a moment where you felt a deep connection with your learning—where it didn’t feel like ‘work’ but like something else.”\n“What is missing from your education that you cannot name?”\n“If your education was music, what would it sound like? What rhythms, silences, and harmonies would it have?”\nData Collection Alternative:\nThe interview is recorded and transcribed, but instead of coding it for content themes, we analyze it relationally:\n\nWhat emotions surfaced?\nWhat questions led to the deepest moments of reflection?\nHow did the meaning shift between interviewer and interviewee?\nDraft of a More Relational, Open-Ended Survey\nIf we do need to use a survey format, we can adapt it to be more dialogical, contemplative, and emergent rather than extractive.\n\nSurvey Title: Learning as Relationship - A Shared Inquiry into Education & Wellbeing\n\nSection 1: Your Learning Experience\nDescribe a moment when learning felt meaningful, whole, or deeply connected for you. What made it so? (Open-ended)\nHow do you relate to knowledge? (Select multiple that resonate)\n It is something to accumulate and master.\n It is something I am in conversation with.\n It is something that moves through me.\n It is something relational, shaped with others.\n It is sacred or mysterious.\nHow does time feel in your education? (Open-ended)\n“Does learning feel rushed, rhythmic, spacious? When do you feel most present?”\nHow does the environment around you (classrooms, campus, digital spaces) shape how you learn? (Open-ended)\nHow do you experience success in education? How do you experience failure? (Open-ended)\nSection 2: Institutional Culture & Assumptions\nIf your university had an unspoken rule about what learning should be, what would it be? (Open-ended)\nWhat assumptions about knowledge and success do you think shape your institution’s culture? (Check all that apply)\n Learning should be measurable.\n Education should prepare students for jobs.\n Knowledge belongs to experts.\n Intelligence is individual.\n Meaning and wellbeing are secondary to performance.\nWhere do you feel most at home in your education? Where do you feel most lost? (Open-ended)\nSection 3: Alternative Perspectives\nIf learning was an act of care, how would that change education? (Open-ended)\nWhat ways of learning do you wish were more present in your education? (Check all that apply)\n Learning through relationships and mentorship\n Learning through the body and senses\n Learning through silence and reflection\n Learning through art, music, and creative practice\n Learning through working with the land or nature\n Learning through ritual or contemplative practice\nClosing Reflection\nIf you could whisper something to the heart of your institution, what would it be? (Open-ended)\nFinal Thoughts & Next Steps\nThis alternative relational, non-instrumental approach shifts the focus from extraction to emergence, from quantification to deep listening.\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nDevelop guidelines for facilitating Deep Listening Circles?\nCreate a protocol for analyzing responses relationally instead of statistically?\nDraft an invitation letter for institutions to engage in this inquiry?\nThis approach makes visible the water we are swimming in by inviting slow, reflective engagement rather than quick, detached responses."

Gift of Learning\n   * \"If education were a gift, how would you receive it?\"\n   * Follow-up: \"What would change if you saw it this way?\"\n\nFacilitation Notes:\n* Allow full silence between shares\n* Notice when instrumental language appears\n* Gently invite deeper reflection with \"Say more about that...\"\n* Track moments of surprise or shift in energy\n\n### Closing Integration (40 minutes)\n* Individual reflection writing (10 min)\n* Pair sharing of key insights (10 min)\n* Group harvest of patterns (20 min)\n\n## Phase 2: Campus Exploration\n\n### Setup\n* Groups of 3-4\n* 90-minute exploration\n* Materials: Maps, journals, phones for photos\n* Optional: Audio recorders\n\n### Opening (15 minutes)\n1. Centering Exercise:\n   * Brief body scan\n   * Notice present moment\n   * Set intention for exploration\n\n2. Guiding Questions:\n   * Where does learning feel alive?\n   * Where do you feel rushed?\n   * What spaces invite presence?\n   * Where do you feel belonging?\n\n### Exploration (60 minutes)\n\nSuggested Protocol:\n1. Walk in silence first 15 minutes\n2. Stop at places that evoke strong response\n3. Take photos or make sketches\n4. Write brief notes or poems\n5. Share observations with group\n\nDocumentation Prompts:\n* \"This space makes me feel...\"\n* \"Learning happens here by...\"\n* \"Time moves differently here because...\"\n* \"I belong/don't belong here because...\"\n\n### Integration (15 minutes)\n* Create spatial map of insights\n* Mark transformational spots\n* Note patterns of aliveness/deadness\n\n## Documentation Tools\n\n### 1. Collective Insight Mapping\n\nCreate large visual maps using these elements:\n\n```\nPATTERNS noticed\n   |\n   +--> QUESTIONS raised\n   |\n   +--> TENSIONS felt\n   |\n   +--> POSSIBILITIES glimpsed\n```\n\n### 2. Story Capture Template\n\nFor each significant moment shared:\n\n* Context: Where/When/Who\n* Quotable Quote: Direct language used\n* Energy Shift: What changed in the room\n* Questions Opened: What emerged\n* Connections Made: Links to other shares\n\n### 3. Visual Documentation\n\nCreate collective mind maps using:\n* Different colors for different voices\n* Symbols for types of insights\n* Lines showing connections\n* Space for emergent questions\n\n### 4. Pattern Recognition Guide\n\nLook for patterns in:\n* Language used/avoided\n* Emotional resonance\n* Physical responses\n* Time perception\n* Relationship metaphors\n\n### 5. Transformation Tracking\n\nNotice moments when:\n* Perspective shifts occur\n* New questions emerge\n* Energy changes\n* Assumptions surface\n* Possibilities open\n\n## Integration Across Institutions\n\n### Documentation Sharing Platform\n* Private digital space\n* Upload photos, maps, recordings\n* Tag insights and patterns\n* Cross-pollinate questions\n\n### Monthly Integration Calls\n* Share key insights\n* Notice meta-patterns\n* Evolve the inquiry\n* Plan next steps\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n* Honor confidentiality\n* Maintain relationship focus\n* Avoid extractive documentation\n* Keep inquiry alive\n\nWould you like any section expanded or clarified?",

This aligns with your pattern of \"Heart-connector\" through cooking and sharing.\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Set a gentle morning intention for greeting your brother?\n2. Think about what you might enjoy creating together?\n3.

And why? I think maybe where I went wrong was to start to commodify that and think that it's it's possible to use this, like, DIY self knowledge to start businesses and make money because we have to. Right? I think there was a instrumental element, that transformed Kind of sincere and starting point. But other than that, I'm wondering what to do. Maybe you can give me some suggestions. You know? I have this research project to work with universities to talk about Self perception. Of university and self perception of what education is for.
