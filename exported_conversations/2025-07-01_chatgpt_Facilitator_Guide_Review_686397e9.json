      "content": "can you help me turn this into a good prompt? \nOkay. So this is pretty good, except we went much more in detail on day 1. So I think it's likely to be better if we do a Couple days at a time. But first, let's this and review it in comparison to what we have in the slides already. I'm and, you know, what the minimum changes are and kinda like what the highest level, like, overview of the day so we can get, like, an imagination of the day, what they're gonna really take away, from each of the 3 sections and what they're really gonna be able to learn and do And to have, like, also the time kinda really add up and make sense. And it cohesively kind of connects to being this sort of sales engineering technique that also helps people really get deep into the ability to Apply and implement and monitor the technicians that are doing the install. So they have to be able to do the install themselves, of course. As well as the rest. And and that it's engaging and it's fun. And that we have all the materials that we need to give a trainer, to teach others, and, know, what pictures we might need and and things like that. So, like, check out our Claude, check out this new updated design. And what the different smallest, most impactful changes are and how it connects to our, spreadsheet for the worksheets and how it all adds up. Critique it, a couple of different ways. Part of me wonders if we need all 10 Different, slides. Some of the stuff that Feels like it's not as relevant for us, our of the things that seem a little bit western. Like, safety certainly is definitely important Although there's gonna be a, like, a practical kind of, way to to do it, that isn't, so, it doesn't fall into that sort of, like, ultra liberal No one gets hurt ever kind of attitude. And is about just being reasonable and, doing a good job and, making sure that you take care of things and doing it in the right way. And, yeah, what are some of the things, that we need to also have in terms of the mechanical design and you know, how do you know how much forces are gonna be placed on it in this sort of wind? And how do you know if this design can handle that? And lots of things. So let's let's critique it and make sure it's good. And then, tell me, like, What you think is the best next steps forward because I keep going and iterating and make things difference, but I need to just finish this deliverable and get it out. So where are we at, and how can we improve it, and how do we make it not much more complicated and give, like, a clear strategic plan for making the 2 deliver 1, which is like a facilitation guide, with question and and, answers, and the other is are the slides, questions and answers. All of the elements needed for the facilitation guide to be you know, TOT, worthy. Quotes, stories, how to facilitate common questions, common answers, all that kind of stuff. And, yeah. And then maybe give me the prompts that I can use later to build all this stuff given what we have in Alright. Library. We have a lot of really high quality interviews that has real relevant insights. As well as, slides, and many things. So we have a lot to leverage here. Let's go for it.Critical Review & Strategic Action Plan\nWhat's Working Well\nLearn-Apply-Sell rhythm - This is gold for adult learning\nReal case studies (Ahmed's cafe, Zahra's workshop) - Relatable and practical\nProgressive complexity - Building from basics to full systems\nExcel integration - Each day has its worksheet tab\nKey Issues & Solutions\n1.

The prompt and give the intro and the deeper more robust day one and two facilitator guide and the accompanying slide improvements on our most recent slide deck - minimal changes yet make sure to get the maximum improvements and needed changes for aligning on the new structure - what’s the new structure?",

      "content": "Here’s a cleaned-up and powerful **prompt** you can use to get robust results from a system like ChatGPT, Claude, or your own tooling:\n\n---\n\n**🎯 Prompt: Review, Align, and Upgrade Facilitator Guide & Slide Deck (Days 1–2)**\n\nWe’ve developed a solar installation training program grounded in real-world Iraq context with a \"Learn → Apply → Sell\" daily rhythm. We want to finalize and deliver a *facilitation guide* and *slide deck* for Days 1 and 2. The guide must support **training of trainers (ToT)** and be deeply aligned with the latest structure and strategic goals.\n\n---\n\n**Here’s what I need you to do:**\n\n1. **Review and compare** our current facilitator guide and slides for Days 1 and 2 with the updated structure (provided below).\n2. **Suggest minimal but high-impact slide improvements**, focusing on:\n   - Merging redundant slides\n   - Adding quote/story boxes from interviews\n   - Excel moment callouts (label as Excel Moment #X)\n   - More relevant, local framing (e.g. Iraqi safety context)\n3. **Produce an improved facilitator guide for Day 1 and Day 2** including:\n   - Conversational notes for each slide\n   - Materials needed\n   - Common participant questions & answers\n   - Timing breakdowns per activity\n   - Key learnings & transitions\n   - Any stories, quotes, or visuals to support the content\n4. Be mindful of local tone: practical, professional, confident — not bureaucratic or overly cautious.\n5. Align everything to our **sales engineering goals**: participants should leave able to install, supervise, and sell confidently.\n\n---\n\n**🔧 Reference Structure:**\n\n### **Day 1: “From Bills to Kilowatts”**\n- **Learn:** Energy costs drive everything  \n- **Apply:** Measure loads like a pro  \n- **Sell:** Calculate ROI in your sleep  \n- **Skill:** Convert amps→kWh→IQD instantly  \n- **Excel Moments:** Load sheet setup, ROI calculator  \n- **Stories:** Zahra’s workshop, café with wrong inverter sizing\n\n### **Day 2: “Quality Pays Twice”**\n- **Learn:** Cheap fails expensive  \n- **Apply:** Inspect like a detective  \n- **Sell:** Justify premium prices  \n- **Skill:** Spot fake components  \n- **Excel Moments:** Quality comparison matrix  \n- **Stories:** Ali’s component failure and cost of callback\n\n---\n\n**🧠 Additional Notes:**\n- Refer to the **Claude-enhanced training redesign summary** for strategic priorities.\n- Every activity must be engaging and time-reasonable (max 5–10 min for Excel exercises).\n- Assume trainers may not be electrical engineers, but should still understand what they’re teaching.\n- Don’t add new slides unless necessary—consolidate where possible.\n- Connect to real-world business value: this isn’t just training—it’s income generation.\n\n---\n\n**📦 Deliverables You’ll Return:**\n1. Revised facilitator guide for Day 1 and Day 2 (structured, markdown or table format)\n2. Updated slide notes with merge suggestions and annotations (slide #X → merge with #Y, etc.)\n3. Suggestions for missing visual assets, quotes, or stories\n4. Prompts I can later reuse to extract facilitator notes, quotes, and technical content from our library of interview transcripts and existing slides\n\n---\n\nLet me know when you're ready to begin with Day 1, and I’ll send you the current slide deck and transcript folder. Or—go ahead and generate it now based on the Claude-aligned summary and updated structure above.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to now **run this prompt** and begin drafting the Day 1 facilitator guide + updated slides as a first pass?",
