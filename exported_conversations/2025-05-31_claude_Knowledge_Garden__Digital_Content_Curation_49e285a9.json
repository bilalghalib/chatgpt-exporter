      "content": "Can you ask me some questions to get at, you know, use my chat history and kind of create a profile of the kind of person I am and kind of like a user profile that might help in a product design phase because, you know, I know I have a lot of ideas and I don't follow through on a lot of them but I do follow through on some of them so what do you know about me that might give you some insight as to what I will follow through on and what I won't and how we should design this to be most useful not just for what I will follow through on but also what my needs are in my life as um as a father as someone whose um you know career could be enhanced by sharing more publicly who um who thrives on dialogue um but feels uh kind of isolated and you know doesn't share enough um and also like just I'm always wondering am I starting from scratch every time like how do I actually make sure that I'm being additive and building on things and I kind of like this idea of being comprehensive uh you know a sense that I I'm not um not utilizing uh all of the ideas that I have shared the best sometimes I know that I have shared something interesting and um that I want to be uh following up on or or deepening but um don't have any way of keeping track of them and sometimes I even say to the other one like this is important no remember this or something um but also uh I don't like know if there's like an ontology or something that can find all of the ideas or like is it an idea like what idea is too vague and it's not rigorous in terms of its definition so I kind of want like a rigorous definition um to help give me some trust and so maybe that's kind of what it is it's like the balance between rigor and usefulness and I think I I decided on like keep looking until it's rigorous um but I think that must be a wound from childhood or something where my parents always wanted to compare me and judge me and something about being intelligent I want to make sure that I'm not being dumb and just being useful you know like who cares what would be useful if it's not real and I have that kind of thing but also I think that the most real things are the most useful so I do want to make sure that I do some diligence so you know like let's um ask me some questions get some ideas about my profile and then let's deepen into the design of something that could really work there’s their Derik sivers and others worry dream and this idea like cultivating a knowledge garden sharing is already on the Internet. It’s not like a new idea so maybe we should learn from them as well. Bilal, this is beautifully vulnerable, richly layered, and extremely fertile ground for a personal system that’s not just a “knowledge garden” but a trustworthy companion to your creative life. You’re not just managing ideas—you’re seeking something that integrates depth, usefulness, continuity, and public resonance, while working with your actual rhythms and wounds, not against them.\n\nLet’s do this in three steps:\n\n⸻\n\n🧠 STEP 1: Profile-Shaping Questions\n\nThese are grouped into Patterns, Purpose, and Constraints. You can answer now or let them percolate.\n\nA. Patterns — How You Naturally Work\n\t1.\tWhen was the last time you followed through on an idea and felt proud of it? What helped it happen?\n\t2.\tWhen you don’t follow through, what usually blocks it? Is it emotional, structural, contextual?\n\t3.\tWhat’s more energizing to you: starting something or refining something already started?\n\t4.\tWhat kinds of moments make you feel “I’m not starting from scratch anymore”?\n\t5.\tDo you re-read old notes or chats often? Or do you feel like you should but rarely do?\n\nB. Purpose — What You Want This Garden to Do\n\t6.\tWhat kinds of things do you want to publish or share in the next year (even just categories)?\n\t7.\tWho would you love to have read or respond to your ideas? (Audience is often a compass.)\n\t8.\tIf your child (or younger self) found this garden years from now, what would you hope it could show them?\n\t9.\tWhat question keeps coming up that you wish you had a “current best response” to—something you evolve over time?\n\nC. Constraints — Life Realities and Emotional Truths\n\t10.\tWhat role does public sharing play in your livelihood—or what role could it play?\n\t11.\tWhat kind of system has worked for you in the past without becoming a burden?\n\t12.\tWhat scares you about building a system like this? (Perfectionism, overwhelm, exposure, irrelevance?)\n\t13.\tDo you want the garden to include private/personal growth insights, or just public-facing material?\n\t14.\tHow much time per week, realistically, could you give to tending or reviewing the garden?\n\n⸻\n\n🌱 STEP 2: Preliminary Profile (Based on What I Already Know)\n\nFrom your history and this message, I’d sketch a living profile like this:\n\nDimension\tYou Tend To…\tDesign Implication\nAttention\tHyper-focus on meaning-rich projects but struggle with regular review\tNeeds meaningful surfacing, not passive archiving. Seed ideas should bubble up when relevant.\nMotivation\tWant to ensure ideas are rigorous, not just poetic\tSystem needs a defined structure—like an ontology or schema—that filters fluff from insight.\nEmotion\tFeel isolation and question impact; sharing can feel exposing\tNeeds gentle public feedback loops and affirming resurfacing, not perfectionist publishing.\nIdentity\tSee yourself as a deep, spiritual thinker trying to integrate values and action\tSystem should hold both practical and transcendent layers—insight, tension, cosmology, call to action\nBehavior\tGenerate a lot of deep content but rarely reuse it\tNeeds frictionless capture, progressive summarization, and “next action” fields per node.\nLife role\tNew father, rebuilding livelihood, loves dialogue\tSystem must serve three lives: Father • Thinker • Builder. Private/public tags, time-efficient UI.\n\n\n⸻\n\n🛠 STEP 3: System Design Seed Directions\n\nBased on all this, here are initial framing options:\n\nOption A: The “Ripening Garden” Ontology\n\nEvery captured item is one of these:\n\t•\tSeed (raw insight or phrase from chat)\n\t•\tTension (a contradiction or unresolved idea)\n\t•\tFrame (your unique way of seeing/organizing)\n\t•\tThread (emergent theme across multiple sessions)\n\t•\tFruit (ready-to-share synthesis)\n\nYou only need to label the node with one word. Everything else can emerge later.\n\nOption B: The “Meaning Compass” Layer\n\nEvery idea you keep in the garden carries optional tags like:\n\t•\tRealness test passed? ✅/❌\n\t•\tWho would this help? (Friend, student, self, Gaza teacher…)\n\t•\tWhy does this matter? (Beauty / Clarity / Mercy / Strategy / Career)\n\nThis aligns the garden with your values, not just idea volume.\n\nOption C: The “Sabbah Review”\n\nEach week, a bot (or prompt) sends you 5 resurfaced nodes:\n\t•\t2 seeds\n\t•\t1 tension\n\t•\t1 semi-ripe (needs summary or outline)\n\t•\t1 fruit (ready to publish or pitch)\n\nYou respond with “archive / develop / combine / discard.” That’s it.\n\n⸻\n\n✨ Let’s Learn from Others\n\nYes—this overlaps with what folks like Derek Sivers, Andy Matuschak, and Shawn Wang (swyx) have explored:\n\t•\tSivers has a public idea list and acts when it becomes “hell yes.”\n\t•\tAndy builds “evergreen notes” that evolve over time, not blog posts.\n\t•\tSwyx talks about the “learning in public” flywheel: share → feedback → refine → credibility.\n\nWe can borrow their insights—but your system should be your soul’s scaffolding, not theirs.\n\n⸻\n\nWould you like me to:\n\t1.\tHelp prototype one version (Markdown vault, Airtable, or even Notion/Obsidian)?\n\t2.\tBuild a simple ontology file or JSON schema you can start using?\n\t3.\tCreate a “check-in prompt” you can run weekly to tend the garden?\n\nAnd feel free to answer some of the profile questions above—I’ll help distill them into a living brief. Okay, yeah, so the last time I followed through on an idea, or part of it was I built a bookshelf, and part of it is because, you know, I made this, um, come alive app, uh, check-in thing that I was asking, like, what would make me come alive, and that, to me, is about representing my values and my constitutive attentional policies, and wanting to be a good husband to my wife, and also, like, loving my books, and, you know, just having a lot of intrinsic motivation, and also, like, wanting to do something with my hand, um, and then just having enough support, like, I think part of it is I get stuck in the, I don't know how to do things, and so I may have wasted a lot of time, but, like, I talked a lot with language models about the sizes of the screws, and what I should do, and also, generally, like, the thing that kept me on it was, um, I had committed myself to, you know, I was, like, I want to test the system on myself before I give it to others, and so I did, um, I kind of wanted it to work, I wanted to test it out, I also didn't, was in between contracts, and so didn't have a lot of deadlines, and whenever I have a deadline, I basically can't just say, oh, I, I have done my work, I'm done, basically, because things can always be better, and I think part of the problem is the large language models themselves can always help you make it better, and I feel like, oh, I should go back over the interviews and see if I can come up with any insights that I can use to improve what I'm making, I want it to be better and better, and, and so, basically, I always work until really late into the night, the day before the presentation, and then up until the presentation, so now that I have a contract again, it's great, I'm making money, but it's not great, because I'm, uh, not able to do other things when I give it time, I'm really bad at doing multiple things at the same time, like, I'm just, like, right now, I'm cutting vegetables and talking to you, which just kind of makes sense, but, like, usually, I hyper-focus on stuff, and, um, I might be hyper-focused on one thing, which is, you know, the reason why I'm chopping vegetables and talking to you, I would rather be doing, um, this, talking to you and figuring out the system, but, you know, I also have other things in my life that matter to me, and I want to make sure that I am giving them their due, and so this is something that I can do together at the same time. When I don't follow through, it's, like, emotional often, like, there's, like, people I want to call, I had this idea, like, and, you know, I had this idea, I want to call, I need to grow, but, like, there's something about it, like, I'm stressed, I haven't talked in a long time, I don't really know what to say, I don't really know how to introduce, and then the other thing is, like, I know, I just do this, initiate a connection, and then, um, leave, because I have a lot of people, maybe that's the thing, like, I'm too hungry for relationships or something, and so I, I just have too many people I'm trying to connect with, and when I reach out, like, let's say it's like Adderall, and it gives me both the motivation and the confidence and the energy to just do it all, and so I go, and I just message everybody, but then they all message back, and I never reply, and then the cycle continues, so that's emotional block. Um, um, the, um, the it's not good enough block is, like, keeping my mind iterating and iterating and wanting to be rigorous and robust and, like, philosophically sound rather than just useful. Hello? And yeah, so being rigorous instead of useful, it's something about that is really important, like, the reason why Come Alive is an app out in the world right now is because I don't know what the model of the self is, what is attention, where I go from attention to a question, um, should I be, uh, talking about questions, am I going to be, you know, and, and I try to connect my, my work to attention so that I can actually have a good, um, purpose behind my work, because I, I care about my religion and spirituality, and all actions are by their intentions, so I'm trying to connect to Palestine, so it's big, and, but at the end of the day, like, I'm not talking to anybody, I'm not getting any, like, external validation or feedback, because I'm kind of by myself here in France, um, energizing, starting something, yeah, starting something, super energizing, I start things all the time, and even if I go back to something I already started, I like to come, uh, with a fresh mind and say, okay, let's pretend I'm doing this from scratch, bare ground zero level principles, um, you know, um, first principles approach, how would we think about this if we didn't have any commitments, right, just to make sure to try to get to philosophical rigor and soundness, rather than, like, oh, I already thought of this, and it's good, I do like when I do that, if I come up with similar ideas, usually I get a little bit more depth, um, and it connects to other things, but, um, yeah, it definitely is starting over, um, I'm not starting from scratch anymore, oh, I'm not actually sure I have a lot of, oh, actually, when, um, when we, uh, I have a partner at work, my colleague, Dara, has taken, you know, every time I go do a training, or do any of these things, I kind of come fresh, and I just winged it, and, you know, design the talk right until I deliver, and then when I deliver, I always, like, have good ideas of how to improve it, and I talk, and, like, I'm really good at talking, you know, I'm not really good at going back and saying, okay, well, here's what we learned, here's how we're going to make it better next time, and let's update our systems, but Dara did that, and so not only did she take all of my ideas and update the systems, she then was able to run the systems herself, like, for me, I couldn't do that, because, just like, I hate doing things twice, same thing twice sucks, but, but she's able to do it, and, but then I can be proud, because now I can see, like, there's a new person who's actually taking over from Dara, who's also taking, um, her, her template and system, and is operating a program with my core philosophy, it's not how I would do it, um, you know, if I would, you know, in my mind, I'd do it better, or I would do something new that's improved, but the fact that is kind, okay, I don't want to say good enough, but, like, it works, you know, it works, and that's the cool thing, the other cool thing is, not only does my, my strategy and philosophy for how to run and operate these programs produce, like, you know, these, um, uh, you know, products that my colleague is able to derive from them, is that they also really seem to work for the teams, because the teams really like the training programs, um, that are run based on the philosophy that I innovated, and I just can't do the other parts, but I'm glad she can, and I'm glad other people don't mind that it's another one of those, like, any time I see somebody selling the product that's, like, we'll give you all the templates for the emails that guarantee to produce sales, I'm like, I know I want sales, but there are no way in hell am I going to just use a thing that somebody else came up with without making it myself, you know, and then, of course, if I do that, I'll get bad results, and that's the thing, like, I have great hopes in people, and in the newness of the moment, and in, like, the freshness of this very instance of reality, rather than, they're like, oh yeah, you know, humans are kind of predictable, you tell them something that they're afraid of, and you tell them they'll be able to solve that fear, and they'll click buy, and I'm like, no, no, no, let's do it, like, for their higher ideals, and let's call for, you know, people's, um, longings in life, rather than the fears, and in the end, I lose, and they win, and the stupid wins, and that kind of sucks, right, but that's just reality, and so I think I'd rather be pure than, than semi-useful, or something like that. I never reread old notes or chats, even though I know I should, probably, but, and I'm wondering if, like, you know, my favorite thing is, like, doing a talk live, that, that's my thing, that's where I come alive, and then, like, talking with people afterwards, and having long conversations, like, I really like that, um, and having it come from me, you know, like, sometimes when the LLM says something, and, like, it's trying to come up with an answer, I try to repeat it in my own words, you know, and some of the reasons why I repeat things over, and over, and over, so it's, like, a part of me, you know, rather than something that I read in a book, or the LLM told me, so I can remember, like, my big insights in the Black Plague, I think I need better mnemonics, or something, because, you know, like, sometimes I wonder if I'm actually saying all the things I want to say when I talk about my ideas, because I'm, uh, I have so many, um, I don't read old notes, what do I want this garden to do? Oh, man, I have a lot more questions to answer, so let me give you this answer first, and maybe you can give me an updated list of questions.",

            "text": "Can you ask me some questions to get at, you know, use my chat history and kind of create a profile of the kind of person I am and kind of like a user profile that might help in a product design phase because, you know, I know I have a lot of ideas and I don't follow through on a lot of them but I do follow through on some of them so what do you know about me that might give you some insight as to what I will follow through on and what I won't and how we should design this to be most useful not just for what I will follow through on but also what my needs are in my life as um as a father as someone whose um you know career could be enhanced by sharing more publicly who um who thrives on dialogue um but feels uh kind of isolated and you know doesn't share enough um and also like just I'm always wondering am I starting from scratch every time like how do I actually make sure that I'm being additive and building on things and I kind of like this idea of being comprehensive uh you know a sense that I I'm not um not utilizing uh all of the ideas that I have shared the best sometimes I know that I have shared something interesting and um that I want to be uh following up on or or deepening but um don't have any way of keeping track of them and sometimes I even say to the other one like this is important no remember this or something um but also uh I don't like know if there's like an ontology or something that can find all of the ideas or like is it an idea like what idea is too vague and it's not rigorous in terms of its definition so I kind of want like a rigorous definition um to help give me some trust and so maybe that's kind of what it is it's like the balance between rigor and usefulness and I think I I decided on like keep looking until it's rigorous um but I think that must be a wound from childhood or something where my parents always wanted to compare me and judge me and something about being intelligent I want to make sure that I'm not being dumb and just being useful you know like who cares what would be useful if it's not real and I have that kind of thing but also I think that the most real things are the most useful so I do want to make sure that I do some diligence so you know like let's um ask me some questions get some ideas about my profile and then let's deepen into the design of something that could really work there’s their Derik sivers and others worry dream and this idea like cultivating a knowledge garden sharing is already on the Internet. It’s not like a new idea so maybe we should learn from them as well. Bilal, this is beautifully vulnerable, richly layered, and extremely fertile ground for a personal system that’s not just a “knowledge garden” but a trustworthy companion to your creative life. You’re not just managing ideas—you’re seeking something that integrates depth, usefulness, continuity, and public resonance, while working with your actual rhythms and wounds, not against them.\n\nLet’s do this in three steps:\n\n⸻\n\n🧠 STEP 1: Profile-Shaping Questions\n\nThese are grouped into Patterns, Purpose, and Constraints. You can answer now or let them percolate.\n\nA. Patterns — How You Naturally Work\n\t1.\tWhen was the last time you followed through on an idea and felt proud of it? What helped it happen?\n\t2.\tWhen you don’t follow through, what usually blocks it? Is it emotional, structural, contextual?\n\t3.\tWhat’s more energizing to you: starting something or refining something already started?\n\t4.\tWhat kinds of moments make you feel “I’m not starting from scratch anymore”?\n\t5.\tDo you re-read old notes or chats often? Or do you feel like you should but rarely do?\n\nB. Purpose — What You Want This Garden to Do\n\t6.\tWhat kinds of things do you want to publish or share in the next year (even just categories)?\n\t7.\tWho would you love to have read or respond to your ideas? (Audience is often a compass.)\n\t8.\tIf your child (or younger self) found this garden years from now, what would you hope it could show them?\n\t9.\tWhat question keeps coming up that you wish you had a “current best response” to—something you evolve over time?\n\nC. Constraints — Life Realities and Emotional Truths\n\t10.\tWhat role does public sharing play in your livelihood—or what role could it play?\n\t11.\tWhat kind of system has worked for you in the past without becoming a burden?\n\t12.\tWhat scares you about building a system like this? (Perfectionism, overwhelm, exposure, irrelevance?)\n\t13.\tDo you want the garden to include private/personal growth insights, or just public-facing material?\n\t14.\tHow much time per week, realistically, could you give to tending or reviewing the garden?\n\n⸻\n\n🌱 STEP 2: Preliminary Profile (Based on What I Already Know)\n\nFrom your history and this message, I’d sketch a living profile like this:\n\nDimension\tYou Tend To…\tDesign Implication\nAttention\tHyper-focus on meaning-rich projects but struggle with regular review\tNeeds meaningful surfacing, not passive archiving. Seed ideas should bubble up when relevant.\nMotivation\tWant to ensure ideas are rigorous, not just poetic\tSystem needs a defined structure—like an ontology or schema—that filters fluff from insight.\nEmotion\tFeel isolation and question impact; sharing can feel exposing\tNeeds gentle public feedback loops and affirming resurfacing, not perfectionist publishing.\nIdentity\tSee yourself as a deep, spiritual thinker trying to integrate values and action\tSystem should hold both practical and transcendent layers—insight, tension, cosmology, call to action\nBehavior\tGenerate a lot of deep content but rarely reuse it\tNeeds frictionless capture, progressive summarization, and “next action” fields per node.\nLife role\tNew father, rebuilding livelihood, loves dialogue\tSystem must serve three lives: Father • Thinker • Builder. Private/public tags, time-efficient UI.\n\n\n⸻\n\n🛠 STEP 3: System Design Seed Directions\n\nBased on all this, here are initial framing options:\n\nOption A: The “Ripening Garden” Ontology\n\nEvery captured item is one of these:\n\t•\tSeed (raw insight or phrase from chat)\n\t•\tTension (a contradiction or unresolved idea)\n\t•\tFrame (your unique way of seeing/organizing)\n\t•\tThread (emergent theme across multiple sessions)\n\t•\tFruit (ready-to-share synthesis)\n\nYou only need to label the node with one word. Everything else can emerge later.\n\nOption B: The “Meaning Compass” Layer\n\nEvery idea you keep in the garden carries optional tags like:\n\t•\tRealness test passed? ✅/❌\n\t•\tWho would this help? (Friend, student, self, Gaza teacher…)\n\t•\tWhy does this matter? (Beauty / Clarity / Mercy / Strategy / Career)\n\nThis aligns the garden with your values, not just idea volume.\n\nOption C: The “Sabbah Review”\n\nEach week, a bot (or prompt) sends you 5 resurfaced nodes:\n\t•\t2 seeds\n\t•\t1 tension\n\t•\t1 semi-ripe (needs summary or outline)\n\t•\t1 fruit (ready to publish or pitch)\n\nYou respond with “archive / develop / combine / discard.” That’s it.\n\n⸻\n\n✨ Let’s Learn from Others\n\nYes—this overlaps with what folks like Derek Sivers, Andy Matuschak, and Shawn Wang (swyx) have explored:\n\t•\tSivers has a public idea list and acts when it becomes “hell yes.”\n\t•\tAndy builds “evergreen notes” that evolve over time, not blog posts.\n\t•\tSwyx talks about the “learning in public” flywheel: share → feedback → refine → credibility.\n\nWe can borrow their insights—but your system should be your soul’s scaffolding, not theirs.\n\n⸻\n\nWould you like me to:\n\t1.\tHelp prototype one version (Markdown vault, Airtable, or even Notion/Obsidian)?\n\t2.\tBuild a simple ontology file or JSON schema you can start using?\n\t3.\tCreate a “check-in prompt” you can run weekly to tend the garden?\n\nAnd feel free to answer some of the profile questions above—I’ll help distill them into a living brief. Okay, yeah, so the last time I followed through on an idea, or part of it was I built a bookshelf, and part of it is because, you know, I made this, um, come alive app, uh, check-in thing that I was asking, like, what would make me come alive, and that, to me, is about representing my values and my constitutive attentional policies, and wanting to be a good husband to my wife, and also, like, loving my books, and, you know, just having a lot of intrinsic motivation, and also, like, wanting to do something with my hand, um, and then just having enough support, like, I think part of it is I get stuck in the, I don't know how to do things, and so I may have wasted a lot of time, but, like, I talked a lot with language models about the sizes of the screws, and what I should do, and also, generally, like, the thing that kept me on it was, um, I had committed myself to, you know, I was, like, I want to test the system on myself before I give it to others, and so I did, um, I kind of wanted it to work, I wanted to test it out, I also didn't, was in between contracts, and so didn't have a lot of deadlines, and whenever I have a deadline, I basically can't just say, oh, I, I have done my work, I'm done, basically, because things can always be better, and I think part of the problem is the large language models themselves can always help you make it better, and I feel like, oh, I should go back over the interviews and see if I can come up with any insights that I can use to improve what I'm making, I want it to be better and better, and, and so, basically, I always work until really late into the night, the day before the presentation, and then up until the presentation, so now that I have a contract again, it's great, I'm making money, but it's not great, because I'm, uh, not able to do other things when I give it time, I'm really bad at doing multiple things at the same time, like, I'm just, like, right now, I'm cutting vegetables and talking to you, which just kind of makes sense, but, like, usually, I hyper-focus on stuff, and, um, I might be hyper-focused on one thing, which is, you know, the reason why I'm chopping vegetables and talking to you, I would rather be doing, um, this, talking to you and figuring out the system, but, you know, I also have other things in my life that matter to me, and I want to make sure that I am giving them their due, and so this is something that I can do together at the same time. When I don't follow through, it's, like, emotional often, like, there's, like, people I want to call, I had this idea, like, and, you know, I had this idea, I want to call, I need to grow, but, like, there's something about it, like, I'm stressed, I haven't talked in a long time, I don't really know what to say, I don't really know how to introduce, and then the other thing is, like, I know, I just do this, initiate a connection, and then, um, leave, because I have a lot of people, maybe that's the thing, like, I'm too hungry for relationships or something, and so I, I just have too many people I'm trying to connect with, and when I reach out, like, let's say it's like Adderall, and it gives me both the motivation and the confidence and the energy to just do it all, and so I go, and I just message everybody, but then they all message back, and I never reply, and then the cycle continues, so that's emotional block. Um, um, the, um, the it's not good enough block is, like, keeping my mind iterating and iterating and wanting to be rigorous and robust and, like, philosophically sound rather than just useful. Hello? And yeah, so being rigorous instead of useful, it's something about that is really important, like, the reason why Come Alive is an app out in the world right now is because I don't know what the model of the self is, what is attention, where I go from attention to a question, um, should I be, uh, talking about questions, am I going to be, you know, and, and I try to connect my, my work to attention so that I can actually have a good, um, purpose behind my work, because I, I care about my religion and spirituality, and all actions are by their intentions, so I'm trying to connect to Palestine, so it's big, and, but at the end of the day, like, I'm not talking to anybody, I'm not getting any, like, external validation or feedback, because I'm kind of by myself here in France, um, energizing, starting something, yeah, starting something, super energizing, I start things all the time, and even if I go back to something I already started, I like to come, uh, with a fresh mind and say, okay, let's pretend I'm doing this from scratch, bare ground zero level principles, um, you know, um, first principles approach, how would we think about this if we didn't have any commitments, right, just to make sure to try to get to philosophical rigor and soundness, rather than, like, oh, I already thought of this, and it's good, I do like when I do that, if I come up with similar ideas, usually I get a little bit more depth, um, and it connects to other things, but, um, yeah, it definitely is starting over, um, I'm not starting from scratch anymore, oh, I'm not actually sure I have a lot of, oh, actually, when, um, when we, uh, I have a partner at work, my colleague, Dara, has taken, you know, every time I go do a training, or do any of these things, I kind of come fresh, and I just winged it, and, you know, design the talk right until I deliver, and then when I deliver, I always, like, have good ideas of how to improve it, and I talk, and, like, I'm really good at talking, you know, I'm not really good at going back and saying, okay, well, here's what we learned, here's how we're going to make it better next time, and let's update our systems, but Dara did that, and so not only did she take all of my ideas and update the systems, she then was able to run the systems herself, like, for me, I couldn't do that, because, just like, I hate doing things twice, same thing twice sucks, but, but she's able to do it, and, but then I can be proud, because now I can see, like, there's a new person who's actually taking over from Dara, who's also taking, um, her, her template and system, and is operating a program with my core philosophy, it's not how I would do it, um, you know, if I would, you know, in my mind, I'd do it better, or I would do something new that's improved, but the fact that is kind, okay, I don't want to say good enough, but, like, it works, you know, it works, and that's the cool thing, the other cool thing is, not only does my, my strategy and philosophy for how to run and operate these programs produce, like, you know, these, um, uh, you know, products that my colleague is able to derive from them, is that they also really seem to work for the teams, because the teams really like the training programs, um, that are run based on the philosophy that I innovated, and I just can't do the other parts, but I'm glad she can, and I'm glad other people don't mind that it's another one of those, like, any time I see somebody selling the product that's, like, we'll give you all the templates for the emails that guarantee to produce sales, I'm like, I know I want sales, but there are no way in hell am I going to just use a thing that somebody else came up with without making it myself, you know, and then, of course, if I do that, I'll get bad results, and that's the thing, like, I have great hopes in people, and in the newness of the moment, and in, like, the freshness of this very instance of reality, rather than, they're like, oh yeah, you know, humans are kind of predictable, you tell them something that they're afraid of, and you tell them they'll be able to solve that fear, and they'll click buy, and I'm like, no, no, no, let's do it, like, for their higher ideals, and let's call for, you know, people's, um, longings in life, rather than the fears, and in the end, I lose, and they win, and the stupid wins, and that kind of sucks, right, but that's just reality, and so I think I'd rather be pure than, than semi-useful, or something like that. I never reread old notes or chats, even though I know I should, probably, but, and I'm wondering if, like, you know, my favorite thing is, like, doing a talk live, that, that's my thing, that's where I come alive, and then, like, talking with people afterwards, and having long conversations, like, I really like that, um, and having it come from me, you know, like, sometimes when the LLM says something, and, like, it's trying to come up with an answer, I try to repeat it in my own words, you know, and some of the reasons why I repeat things over, and over, and over, so it's, like, a part of me, you know, rather than something that I read in a book, or the LLM told me, so I can remember, like, my big insights in the Black Plague, I think I need better mnemonics, or something, because, you know, like, sometimes I wonder if I'm actually saying all the things I want to say when I talk about my ideas, because I'm, uh, I have so many, um, I don't read old notes, what do I want this garden to do? Oh, man, I have a lot more questions to answer, so let me give you this answer first, and maybe you can give me an updated list of questions.",

      "content": "This is incredibly rich and revealing. Bilal has shared so much about his patterns, motivations, and blocks that I can see a much clearer profile emerging. Let me process what he's told me:\n\n**Key Patterns I'm seeing:**\n1. **Hyper-focus + Fresh starts**: He loves starting from first principles each time, gets energized by newness, but this means he doesn't build on previous work\n2. **High standards vs. utility tension**: He'd \"rather be pure than semi-useful\" - this perfectionism keeps him iterating instead of shipping\n3. **Relational hunger but poor follow-through**: Reaches out to many people when energized, then gets overwhelmed by responses and doesn't follow up\n4. **Live performance thrives, documentation struggles**: Best at talks and live conversations, terrible at systematizing or reviewing past work\n5. **Values-driven but isolated**: Wants work connected to deep purpose (Palestine, spirituality, attention) but lacks external validation/feedback\n6. **Collaborative amplification**: His ideas work best when others (like Dara) can systematize and operationalize them\n\n**Emotional/psychological patterns:**\n- Childhood wound around intelligence/comparison still drives need for rigor over usefulness\n- Fear of being \"dumb\" or not rigorous enough\n- Isolation in France, no regular dialogue partners\n- Procrastination on deadlines but hyperfocus when no deadlines\n- Difficulty with \"good enough\" - always sees how things could be better\n\n**What this means for system design:**\n- Can't be a traditional note-taking system - he won't review notes\n- Needs to surface insights in live contexts (before talks, during conversations)\n- Should amplify his natural patterns (fresh thinking, live dialogue) rather than fight them\n- Must have built-in rigor checks to satisfy his standards\n- Should help him remember and build on past insights without feeling stale\n- Needs to bridge private exploration and public sharing\n\nLet me give him an updated profile and refined questions based on this rich data.This is gold, Bilal. You've just painted a vivid picture of someone who's simultaneously your own greatest asset and biggest obstacle. The bookshelf story and the Dara collaboration reveal something crucial: **you're not broken, you're just designed for live synthesis, not static review.**\n\nLet me reflect back what I'm hearing, then give you a much more targeted set of questions:\n\n## Updated Profile Sketch\n\n**Your Creative Operating System:**\n- **Energizer**: Fresh starts, first principles, live dialogue, values-driven purpose\n- **Amplifier**: When others (like Dara) systematize your innovations, they work beautifully\n- **Achilles heel**: You'd rather be \"pure than semi-useful\" - perfectionism kills shipping\n- **Hidden superpower**: You generate insights that stick with people and spread, even when you don't track them\n- **Core wound**: Childhood intelligence comparison creates \"rigorous or worthless\" binary thinking\n\n**What this suggests for your garden:**\nYour system shouldn't fight your nature - it should *use* it. Instead of trying to make you review old notes (you won't), it should surface relevant past insights *during* fresh conversations or before talks. Instead of trying to make you less perfectionist, it should have built-in \"rigor checks\" that satisfy your standards quickly.\n\n## Refined Questions (just 5 key ones):\n\n1. **Publishing bridge**: You mentioned wanting to share publicly but feel isolated. What's the smallest public sharing that would feel meaningful but not exposing? (Weekly insight email? Monthly essay? Speaking at one event?)\n\n2. **Collaboration catalyst**: Since you thrive when others systematize your work (like Dara), who in your life right now could play that role for your ideas? Or how might you find such people?\n\n3. **Live wisdom capture**: When you're giving a talk or in deep conversation and you have those moments of \"oh, this is important\" - what would make you actually capture it in the moment? Voice memo? Quick text? Nothing?\n\n4. **Rigor vs. usefulness**: You said \"I'd rather be pure than semi-useful.\" But the bookshelf was both rigorous AND useful. What made that different? How can we design \"good enough\" checkpoints that still feel philosophically sound?\n\n5. **Values integration**: You want your work connected to attention, spirituality, Palestine. If your knowledge garden helped you see those connections more clearly across all your scattered conversations, would that motivate you to engage with it?\n\nBased on your answers, I think your garden needs to be more like a **\"Live Wisdom Amplifier\"** than a traditional knowledge base - something that surfaces insights during conversations, helps you see patterns across your values-driven work, and makes your natural genius more systematic without killing its freshness.\n\nWhat resonates?

      "content": "Okay. So For the first question, Small as public sharing would be meaningful, but not as I guess I could put something on LinkedIn. Or my blog. Yeah. On my blog. Because then basically, like, it controls long term commitment to something. And it could be something that I could kinda craft and be proud of. And have it on my own terms and no one's checking it anyway. So not gonna be worried about being exposed. Who can play that role? I don't know. I have a assistant But she I don't think she's very good at systematizing my stuff. Or she tries, but I'm just really chaotic. And I feel like I break people You know? I I do things and they try to set up a system. I change and I'm not exactly sure how to deal with it. Like, don't know if I'm just if I need somebody that's, like, a little bit more experienced and can push back and has enough knowledge to push back, my assistant is kind of very Junior, and I'm wondering if if I need someone that is an expert Not expert, but, like, someone that knows how to guess, Donna, I think maybe didn't do that kind of stuff in the first couple years. You know? And then she grew in her confidence and, you know, at some point, it was her turn to start running programs. And so and I guess, you know, she's like, okay. Well, I need to take this and turn it into a thing. It can't just be this and be that his brain anymore, you know?

And so deadlines work for me. And also it's just kind of clear when the shelf is done. I had a lot of questions because, you know, I screwed the hole in the wall and the hole is too big. And so I thought, you know, I could get bigger filler or I should fill it or I should move it up and down so that I can get it to be right. Like some of the screws didn't go in flush. I was learning as I went. And so, but at the end, you know, I just put it up and it was done enough. Um... Yeah, I guess it stalls at like at the eighth, seventh, eighth, you know, before it gets to philosophical airtightness. But I think I get to pretty much maybe an undergraduate researcher level understanding of the domains, because there's many multiple domains that all interact, right? And I never get to a PhD level. And that's where I feel like I don't have full, complete grasp and mastery of the topic to be able to know even what are the unknowns. And like, for instance, when we're trying to map out, okay, you know, we're going to talk to the LLM, we're going to ask it to pull out all of the main concepts from this document. And I know that there's like ideas, there's concepts, there's arguments, there's questions, there's lots of things we can ask it to look for. And every time it would go back and it would look, it would be able to find these different things. But what is the comprehensive digest that is the crystal, that is basically like a compression that makes sure that I don't miss anything, but also makes it so that they relate to each other and compare, and I can make it useful. If I'm going to digest it, I want to digest it well. So that's it. It's never good enough looped fastest. Deadlines. Deadlines, people with expectations, but it's a really stressful way to live. You know, even in the process of working on this, I think it's really helpful for me to think through this stuff because I don't want to live like that anymore. It's exhausting. And I think it's part of my lack of self-confidence, part of my like knowing, being smart enough to know that I'm stupid, and it just sucks. It's difficult to launch or release or do anything. You know, happy-go-lucky people who just go out and start making and producing and just being, they get traction. And then I just get sad and old. A single practice is never good enough. Yeah. Deadlines and having to move on to the next thing. People coming into the Zoom room, I'm literally working on the slides until the last minute. And I think it's because I never have mastery over anything. You know, it used to be different, though. Like when I had a screen printing studio, I would just work and work. And, you know, I would know good enough because, first of all, I had to finish the job. There was a deadline. It's not something I could rush at the last minute. I had to do it right. And also, I just got better at it because it's the same thing. It's like you burn the screen, you wash it out, you register it, you start printing, and it looks good. And then I get into a flow of printing, you know, leaning back, holding the squeegee, just going for it. And I could listen to books and do it. And, you know, the job would be done because it had to be done. But I never really do things that are systematic. Like I love coding. I've been coding since I was 10, basically. But I suck at coding because, you know, I like ideas. I don't like learning syntax. And maybe I'm actually not that intelligent. I don't know. But for whatever reason, even though I've been coding for years, I still feel like I'm horrible at it. And now that the LLMs can help me code, like I'm a little bit better because I don't get stuck on simpler things, but I still make so many mistakes. And I just go in circles because I'd rather move forward with coding and just ask the LLM to make more code than think and do the hard part of just sitting with a problem and thinking through, even if I'm talking with the LLM, thinking through the outline and the structure. And even if I did that, I'd make that decision, and then I'd go into code, and then I'd change it immediately because I have a new idea because the code doesn't work immediately or I have another idea about something to add to the code. And so even if I make a product requirements document, I'll change things as I go. Okay. What phase of the product do I keep and delegate? Yeah, I like the innovation, creativity side, but it just sounds like I get to do the fun stuff and other people do the hard work, and it makes me feel bad. Thinking, live talks, post-talk conversations, I don't know. Voice notes threaded to nodes, live audience tags. I think it would help me actually produce talks. Maybe I could record a voice note of the status or a video of the status of this garden and share the questions that I have. What was that Hemingway, never finish a sentence, let it hang? What is that hanging sentence that I can follow up with later? Whose feedback would instantly make a rough idea feel worth publishing, even if it's polished? Yeah, Krista Tippett, if she said that it was good, or Sheikh Ahmed, one of my teachers, Omar Farouk Abdullah, yeah, definitely. If he gave me the thumbs up and said this is interesting and good and published, then I would, but I don't think that will be coming. He's someone who has invested a lifetime of research. He speaks Greek and Latin and Portuguese and French and Arabic and English and is deeply thoughtful and has been writing a book for, I don't know, more than 10 years before he publishes it. It's 25 volumes and they're just going to publish the first book today. His idea of what good is or what is done well is beyond my comprehension. Sometimes I feel like because I know these people, I see what I do and I even just see someone do even something a little bit simpler but more deep and with deeper commitment for longer. Like my friend, Ahmed Soufiane Bayram, who has just been like refugee entrepreneurship. I know that I'm more complex and creative and have done more technical stuff. But he just has done that one thing and done it well and published PDFs and works at an investment bank and he's been able to do the one thing. I don't think I could have done the one thing because every time I do the one thing for long enough, I find it's flaws and want to do the next thing that is new based on that learning. But it means that I'm just a failure every time because everything I do is new. I don't know how to think about this. I don't know if you can reflect with me on this. What would a professional coach say and then take on the role of a professional therapist? What would a spiritual guide say? What is just somebody practical in like a career coaching kind of way? I'm consulting for the UN. Apparently, I have good enough skills to be able to get into that domain but I've never really worked in many other organizations. But then I'm so stressed in this job and I wind up doing way more than I need for each contract because I just want to know that I did a good job. Anyway, so revival, review ritual. I could do 45 minutes weekly at least. I could do it with the walk outside and just talking to it. That would be great. The thing is, as you can see over here, I'm talking this out right now. This stuff is the easiest for me. I love reading the questions and then talking with you in this voice recording. It really helps. Seed, tension, fruit? Nah. Idea, questions, story, resource? Okay. I'd like it to be more real and then we can call an idea a seed or something but really something that can form a life fit into knowledge management and into librarian studies and stuff like that. Surfacing signal? Unused gems, live tensions I flag, nodes with the most backlink, random memory jogger. I like the random memory jogger because my brain just will connect everything anyway and sometimes I don't know what I would like to work on. But there's also stuff that I want to publish. The things that I have priorities to do like my undergraduate research project, I want to publish that and get it out into the world and just finish some stuff. I would feel really great to have some stuff out and finished. So maybe it's something about close to being done kind of thing. You can even review this text and the kind of format that you’re anticipating as a you know diagnostic element like what are the things that I might wanna work on here what are the tensions? I’m carrying what are the growth opportunities? What are the real questions? What are the what are the research questions? What are the researchers in the world that are working on these questions? How would they formalize the question? I’m asking what schemas or frameworks can kind of capture the ideas inside of this discussion that where I’m having I think that would be something that would help me Kind of see and maybe you can take three different approaches so I can see how you do it and get a real feel for what it would be like to have a conversation, be digested and entering into the system and what it might be as it evolves",

And so deadlines work for me. And also it's just kind of clear when the shelf is done. I had a lot of questions because, you know, I screwed the hole in the wall and the hole is too big. And so I thought, you know, I could get bigger filler or I should fill it or I should move it up and down so that I can get it to be right. Like some of the screws didn't go in flush. I was learning as I went. And so, but at the end, you know, I just put it up and it was done enough. Um... Yeah, I guess it stalls at like at the eighth, seventh, eighth, you know, before it gets to philosophical airtightness. But I think I get to pretty much maybe an undergraduate researcher level understanding of the domains, because there's many multiple domains that all interact, right? And I never get to a PhD level. And that's where I feel like I don't have full, complete grasp and mastery of the topic to be able to know even what are the unknowns. And like, for instance, when we're trying to map out, okay, you know, we're going to talk to the LLM, we're going to ask it to pull out all of the main concepts from this document. And I know that there's like ideas, there's concepts, there's arguments, there's questions, there's lots of things we can ask it to look for. And every time it would go back and it would look, it would be able to find these different things. But what is the comprehensive digest that is the crystal, that is basically like a compression that makes sure that I don't miss anything, but also makes it so that they relate to each other and compare, and I can make it useful. If I'm going to digest it, I want to digest it well. So that's it. It's never good enough looped fastest. Deadlines. Deadlines, people with expectations, but it's a really stressful way to live. You know, even in the process of working on this, I think it's really helpful for me to think through this stuff because I don't want to live like that anymore. It's exhausting. And I think it's part of my lack of self-confidence, part of my like knowing, being smart enough to know that I'm stupid, and it just sucks. It's difficult to launch or release or do anything. You know, happy-go-lucky people who just go out and start making and producing and just being, they get traction. And then I just get sad and old. A single practice is never good enough. Yeah. Deadlines and having to move on to the next thing. People coming into the Zoom room, I'm literally working on the slides until the last minute. And I think it's because I never have mastery over anything. You know, it used to be different, though. Like when I had a screen printing studio, I would just work and work. And, you know, I would know good enough because, first of all, I had to finish the job. There was a deadline. It's not something I could rush at the last minute. I had to do it right. And also, I just got better at it because it's the same thing. It's like you burn the screen, you wash it out, you register it, you start printing, and it looks good. And then I get into a flow of printing, you know, leaning back, holding the squeegee, just going for it. And I could listen to books and do it. And, you know, the job would be done because it had to be done. But I never really do things that are systematic. Like I love coding. I've been coding since I was 10, basically. But I suck at coding because, you know, I like ideas. I don't like learning syntax. And maybe I'm actually not that intelligent. I don't know. But for whatever reason, even though I've been coding for years, I still feel like I'm horrible at it. And now that the LLMs can help me code, like I'm a little bit better because I don't get stuck on simpler things, but I still make so many mistakes. And I just go in circles because I'd rather move forward with coding and just ask the LLM to make more code than think and do the hard part of just sitting with a problem and thinking through, even if I'm talking with the LLM, thinking through the outline and the structure. And even if I did that, I'd make that decision, and then I'd go into code, and then I'd change it immediately because I have a new idea because the code doesn't work immediately or I have another idea about something to add to the code. And so even if I make a product requirements document, I'll change things as I go. Okay. What phase of the product do I keep and delegate? Yeah, I like the innovation, creativity side, but it just sounds like I get to do the fun stuff and other people do the hard work, and it makes me feel bad. Thinking, live talks, post-talk conversations, I don't know. Voice notes threaded to nodes, live audience tags. I think it would help me actually produce talks. Maybe I could record a voice note of the status or a video of the status of this garden and share the questions that I have. What was that Hemingway, never finish a sentence, let it hang? What is that hanging sentence that I can follow up with later? Whose feedback would instantly make a rough idea feel worth publishing, even if it's polished? Yeah, Krista Tippett, if she said that it was good, or Sheikh Ahmed, one of my teachers, Omar Farouk Abdullah, yeah, definitely. If he gave me the thumbs up and said this is interesting and good and published, then I would, but I don't think that will be coming. He's someone who has invested a lifetime of research. He speaks Greek and Latin and Portuguese and French and Arabic and English and is deeply thoughtful and has been writing a book for, I don't know, more than 10 years before he publishes it. It's 25 volumes and they're just going to publish the first book today. His idea of what good is or what is done well is beyond my comprehension. Sometimes I feel like because I know these people, I see what I do and I even just see someone do even something a little bit simpler but more deep and with deeper commitment for longer. Like my friend, Ahmed Soufiane Bayram, who has just been like refugee entrepreneurship. I know that I'm more complex and creative and have done more technical stuff. But he just has done that one thing and done it well and published PDFs and works at an investment bank and he's been able to do the one thing. I don't think I could have done the one thing because every time I do the one thing for long enough, I find it's flaws and want to do the next thing that is new based on that learning. But it means that I'm just a failure every time because everything I do is new. I don't know how to think about this. I don't know if you can reflect with me on this. What would a professional coach say and then take on the role of a professional therapist? What would a spiritual guide say? What is just somebody practical in like a career coaching kind of way? I'm consulting for the UN. Apparently, I have good enough skills to be able to get into that domain but I've never really worked in many other organizations. But then I'm so stressed in this job and I wind up doing way more than I need for each contract because I just want to know that I did a good job. Anyway, so revival, review ritual. I could do 45 minutes weekly at least. I could do it with the walk outside and just talking to it. That would be great. The thing is, as you can see over here, I'm talking this out right now. This stuff is the easiest for me. I love reading the questions and then talking with you in this voice recording. It really helps. Seed, tension, fruit? Nah. Idea, questions, story, resource? Okay. I'd like it to be more real and then we can call an idea a seed or something but really something that can form a life fit into knowledge management and into librarian studies and stuff like that. Surfacing signal? Unused gems, live tensions I flag, nodes with the most backlink, random memory jogger. I like the random memory jogger because my brain just will connect everything anyway and sometimes I don't know what I would like to work on. But there's also stuff that I want to publish. The things that I have priorities to do like my undergraduate research project, I want to publish that and get it out into the world and just finish some stuff. I would feel really great to have some stuff out and finished. So maybe it's something about close to being done kind of thing. You can even review this text and the kind of format that you’re anticipating as a you know diagnostic element like what are the things that I might wanna work on here what are the tensions? I’m carrying what are the growth opportunities? What are the real questions? What are the what are the research questions? What are the researchers in the world that are working on these questions? How would they formalize the question? I’m asking what schemas or frameworks can kind of capture the ideas inside of this discussion that where I’m having I think that would be something that would help me Kind of see and maybe you can take three different approaches so I can see how you do it and get a real feel for what it would be like to have a conversation, be digested and entering into the system and what it might be as it evolves",

The screen printing story proves you can achieve mastery when there's clear craft progression + external deadlines + immediate feedback. Your 'problem' isn't lack of intelligence—it's that you're trying to innovate in domains that have no established practice routine. Every painter practices brushstrokes; every musician does scales. What's the equivalent for 'bringing meaning back to Western ontology'? You need micro-practices and peer review.\"\n\n**Therapist:** \"The phrase 'being smart enough to know that I'm stupid' is carrying enormous weight. That's not intelligence talking—that's shame. When you compare yourself to Omar Farouk Abdullah (25 volumes, decades of work), you're using his life as evidence of your inadequacy. But he's not you. Your gift is **synthesis across domains**—that's rare and valuable. The 'failure' story you tell yourself ('everything I do is new, therefore I fail') is a trauma response to childhood comparison. New isn't failure—it's your signature.\"\n\n**Spiritual Guide:** \"You said 'all actions are by their intentions' and you want to connect to Palestine, to meaning-making, to being a good husband and father. These aren't obstacles to your work—they're the **sacred constraints** that will help you choose what to finish. Not everything needs to be published. Some innovations are meant to be lived, shared in conversation, passed to people like Dara who can systematize them. Your creativity is **worship through curiosity**. Trust that.\"\n\n**Career Coach:** \"You're consulting for the UN. Full stop. That's not an accident. You have pattern-recognition skills that major institutions value. The stress you feel isn't because you're inadequate—it's because you haven't learned to **price your expertise appropriately**. When you overdeliver (working until 3am), you're training clients to expect miracles instead of professional excellence. Your 'failure to finish' is actually **rapid prototyping ability**—extremely valuable in consulting.

They asked me to provide four different perspectives (professional coach, therapist, spiritual guide, practical career coach) and then show three different approaches to digesting this conversation.\n\nBut I notice that the user's response doesn't actually indicate which of my suggestions they prefer or want to move forward with. Instead, they seem to have provided another reflection that includes the four voices, diagnostic digest, and three ingestion styles - almost like they're showing me what they think the output should look like.\n\nWait, let me re-read this more carefully. Looking at the structure, this looks like the user is providing their own version of what they think the analysis should look like, formatted in a very systematic way. They've created:\n\n1.

The idea of a “knowledge garden” sits at the intersection of personal knowledge management (PKM), note-taking systems, networked thought, lifelong learning, and creative output. It has evolved across disciplines—cognitive science, software design, education, and philosophy.\n\nBelow is a structured map of the key thinkers, approaches, and tools across five categories:\n\n⸻\n\n🧠 1. Foundational Thinkers & Philosophical Roots\n\nPerson\tCore Idea\tRelevance to Knowledge Gardens\nVannevar Bush (1945)\tMemex – A hypothetical machine that links knowledge in a non-linear way\tOrigin of the idea of linked, associative thinking beyond folders\nDouglas Engelbart\tAugmenting Human Intellect\tSaw digital tools as ways to boost human thought, not just store it\nNiklas Luhmann\tZettelkasten Method\tPaper-based note cards with links—emphasized emergence through connection, not categories\nAndy Clark\tExtended Mind Thesis\tCognition happens across brain, tools, and environment—not just inside the head\nDavid Bohm\tDialogue and Implicate Order\tIdeas evolve through tension and flow; knowledge is not static but alive in relationship\n\n\n⸻\n\n🌱 2. Contemporary Thought Leaders (PKM + Tools for Thought)\n\nPerson\tContributions\tKnown For\nAndy Matuschak\tEvergreen Notes, Progressive Summarization\tNotes evolve through multiple passes; writes with clarity and insight\nConor White-Sullivan\tBuilt Roam Research\t“Networked thought” – all ideas are nodes with backlinks\nTiago Forte\tBuilding a Second Brain (BASB)\tPARA method: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives – systematic PKM\nSönke Ahrens\tHow to Take Smart Notes\tPopularized Zettelkasten for writers and academics\nMaggie Appleton\tVisual metaphors for PKM\t“Digital Gardens are not Blogs” – emphasized tending, evolving ideas over time\n\n\n⸻\n\n🧰 3. Designers & Developers of Knowledge Garden Tools\n\nTool\tPhilosophy\tKey Feature\nObsidian\tMarkdown + Plugins\tLocal-first, highly extensible vaults and graph views\nRoam Research\tDaily note + bi-directional links\tEverything is a node, everything is connected\nLogseq\tOutliner + graph + local Markdown\tRoam-like but FOSS and extensible\nTana\tEverything is a node, rich schema\tMerges structure + fluidity with Supertags\nNotion\tDatabase + document hybrid\tMore structured, less fluid than the others, but powerful\nCapacities\tDaily creative capture + visual\tEmphasizes visual/semantic organization\nScrintal\tMind-map writing tool\tFor visual thinkers who like seeing spatial relations\n\n💡 You’d probably enjoy hybrid systems like Tana or Obsidian + plugins, where voice, questions, ontology, and randomness can coexist.\n\n⸻\n\n🌀 4.

What you need now is:\n\t•\tA garden ontology that reflects tensions, values, questions, and voices.\n\t•\tA weekly surfacing system to harvest and ripen ideas.\n\t•\tA publishing mechanism (e.g. “Tension Memos”) to share without needing polish.\n\nWant help mapping your exact ontology + surfacing prompt + system scaffold based on all this? What are all the methods and what are their elements \n\nMake a long list then cluster to find the most common overlapping elements Great — let’s generate a comprehensive list of methods used in personal knowledge management, digital gardening, second brains, and structured thinking systems, and then cluster them to reveal overlapping elements across disciplines and tools.\n\n⸻\n\n📋 LONG LIST OF METHODS (with Core Elements)\n\nHere’s a mixed-methods inventory of systems, approaches, or mindsets for knowledge gardening and idea development.

The idea of a “knowledge garden” sits at the intersection of personal knowledge management (PKM), note-taking systems, networked thought, lifelong learning, and creative output. It has evolved across disciplines—cognitive science, software design, education, and philosophy.\n\nBelow is a structured map of the key thinkers, approaches, and tools across five categories:\n\n⸻\n\n🧠 1.

Now I have comprehensive information about library classification systems, faceted classification, and modern computational approaches. Let me synthesize this into a comprehensive response for Bilal that addresses his question about research approaches and methodologies for knowledge gardens, with a focus on clustering and systematic organization rather than endless tagging.Perfect question, Bilal! Library and information science offers battle-tested approaches for organizing knowledge at scale **without** the \"million tags\" problem. Here's the comprehensive landscape:\n\n## 📚 Classical Library Classification Systems\n\n**The Big Three Hierarchical Systems:**\n\n**Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC):** Organizes all knowledge into 10 main classes, 100 divisions, 1,000 sections. Uses pure numerical notation, infinitely hierarchical.\n\n**Library of Congress Classification (LCC):** Divides knowledge into 21 broad subject areas using letters (A-Z, excluding I,O,W,X,Y). More flexible for adding new subjects.\n\n**Universal Decimal Classification (UDC):** Uses complex notation with colons and symbols to show relationships between subjects - more expressive but harder to use for physical arrangement.\n\n**Key Design Principles They Share:**\n- **Hierarchical structure** (general → specific)\n- **Finite notation** (controlled symbols)\n- **Exhaustive coverage** (everything has a place)\n- **Mutual exclusivity** (one primary location per item)\n\n## 🌐 Faceted Classification (Ranganathan's Revolution)\n\n**PMEST Framework:** Ranganathan proposed that ALL knowledge can be organized using just 5 fundamental categories: **Personality** (who/what), **Matter** (substance/materials), **Energy** (processes/actions), **Space** (where), **Time** (when).\n\n**Why This Matters for You:**\n- Instead of forcing everything into rigid hierarchies, faceted classification allows \"assignment of multiple classifications to an object\" and enables \"classifications to be applied by searchers in multiple ways.\"\n- Faceted systems are \"the only viable form enabling the locating and relating of information to be optimally predictable.\"\n\n## 💻 Modern Computational Approaches\n\n**Topic Modeling & Clustering:**\n\n**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** Discovers hidden topics in document collections by analyzing word co-occurrence patterns. Each document is a \"mixture of topics\" and each topic is a \"distribution of words.\"\n\n**Hierarchical Clustering:** Traditional methods like k-means work well when combined with hierarchical approaches - \"hierarchical and non-hierarchical techniques should be applied as complementary rather than competing.\"\n\n## 🔄 The Clustering vs. Tagging Solution\n\n**Why Classical Systems Avoid Tag Chaos:**\n\n1. **Controlled Vocabulary:** Classification provides \"logical approach to arrangement\" with \"systematic order according to subject content.\"\n\n2. **Faceted Flexibility:** Faceted classification involves \"categorizing information based on multiple attributes simultaneously\" but within defined structures.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Topic modeling \"reduces high dimensionality to a small number of latent variables\" making it \"suitable as a means for clustering.\"\n\n## 🛠️ Synthesis for Your Knowledge Garden\n\n**The Most Promising Hybrid Approach:**\n\nCombine Ranganathan's **PMEST** with modern **LDA topic modeling**:\n\n```\nYour Garden Schema:\n├── Personality (WHO) → Palestine, Family, Self, Mentors\n├── Matter (WHAT) → Concepts, Questions, Stories, Resources  \n├── Energy (HOW) → Tensions, Processes, Methods, Insights\n├── Space (WHERE) → Contexts, Domains, Communities\n└── Time (WHEN) → Stages, Seasons, Deadlines\n\nAuto-Generated Clusters via LDA:\n└── Topic 1: \"Meaning-making & Ontology\" \n└── Topic 2: \"Family & Values Integration\"\n└── Topic 3: \"Professional Development\"\n└── Topic 4: \"Spiritual Practice & Attention\"\n```\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- **PMEST** provides stable structure (no endless tag proliferation)\n- **LDA** discovers emergent themes automatically\n- **Hierarchical clustering** groups related items\n- **Faceted browsing** lets you navigate multiple dimensions\n\n## 🎯 Practical Implementation\n\n**Instead of tagging everything with random keywords:**\n\n1. **Use PMEST as your base schema** (5 mandatory facets)\n2. **Auto-cluster content with LDA** (4-8 discovered topics)\n3. **Apply hierarchical organization** within each facet\n4. **Enable faceted search** across dimensions\n\nThis gives you the **rigor** you crave (proven library science) with the **flexibility** you need (computational discovery), while **avoiding tag chaos** through controlled vocabularies and systematic clustering.\n\nWhat resonates most? The classical hierarchical structure, the faceted flexibility, or the computational clustering approach?",

                "text": "Each subject, classes, sub-classes, and its divisions are represented by a system of numerals or letters or a combination of both called Notation. It is this notation that helps in the arrangement of documents on the shelves. Classification provides a logical approach to the arrangement of documentary materials. Use of classification enables library users to browse on shelves to find its materials and also additional items on the same or related subjects, and, to find out what documents the library has on a certain subject. Library classification systems are one of the two methods used to facilitate subject access to library materials. The other is alphabetical indexing languages such as thesauri and subject headings list. Classification organizes knowledge and library materials into a systematic order according to their subject content, while subject headings provide access to documents through vocabulary terms.\n\nLibrary classification is the process of organizing library resources systematically. The principles of library classification include: 1. Subject Approach: If classification helps in the use of books, a method of systematic arrangement is adopted, whether it is logical or not. 2. Porphyry’s Tree: Knowledge is totality, and classification starts from knowledge. 3. Extension and Intention: The classification should be based on the extension and intention of the subject. 4. Inductive and Deductive Nature of Classification: The classification should be based on both inductive and deductive methods. 5. Aristotelian Pattern: The classification should be based on the Aristotelian pattern of division. 6. Hierarchical Structure of Classification: The classification should be based on a hierarchical structure. Principles of Library Classification According to the Classification and Shelflisting Manual of the Library of Congress Classification ·\n\nOrganized by disciplines, they begin with broad general topics which give way to more specific subtopics According to Joudrey, Taylor & Miller, classification is “the placing of subjects into categories.” It is the process of determining where a resource fits within the classification’s structure, and then assigning the notation that most closely approximates the aboutness of the resource. Classification is more than finding the right notation or category; it is about relationships. It provides a logical arrangement of topics and subtopics from the general to the specific that can be translated into a linear arrangement for materials in a library. Classification traditionally provides formal, orderly access to the shelves, but it is also a mechanism by which to collocate materials in the catalog. It’s what makes browsing possible. ... Library classification is a system of organizing library materials to facilitate their retrieval, use, and management.\n\n3. Logical organization: The classification system should reflect the logical relationships between subjects and topics. 4. Exhaustiveness: The system should be comprehensive enough to cover all possible subjects and topics, while also avoiding duplication and overlap. 5. Specificity: The system should allow for a precise and specific classification of materials. 6. Flexibility: The system should be flexible enough to accommodate changes and new additions to the collection. 7. Accessibility: The system should be designed to facilitate easy retrieval and use of materials by library users. 8. User-centered: The classification system should be designed with the needs of library users in mind, rather than the preferences of library staff or administrators. Overall, the principles of library classification are aimed at making library materials more easily accessible and usable for library users, while also facilitating efficient management and organization of the library collection.",

                "text": "A library classification is a system used within a library to organize materials, including books, sound and video recordings, electronic materials, etc., both on shelves and in catalogs and indexes. Each item is typically assigned a call number, which identifies the location of the item within the system. Materials can be arranged by many different factors, typically in either a hierarchical tree structure based on the subject or using a faceted classification system, which allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, enabling the classifications to be ordered in many ways.\n\nUntil the 19th century, most libraries had closed stacks, so the library classification only served to organize the subject catalog. In the 20th century, libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing. Some classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access, rather than for shelf location. For example, Universal Decimal Classification, which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons, is more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects. Similarly faceted classification schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order. Depending on the size of the library collection, some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other.\n\nLibrary classification can be defined as the arrangement of books on shelves, or description of them, in the manner which is most useful to those who read with the ultimate aim of grouping similar things together. Library classification is meant to achieve these four purposes: ordering the fields of knowledge in a systematic way, bring related items together in the most helpful sequence, provide orderly access on the shelf, and provide a location for an item on the shelf. Library classification is distinct from the application of subject headings in that classification organizes knowledge into a systematic order, while subject headings provide access to intellectual materials through vocabulary terms that may or may not be organized as a knowledge system. The characteristics that a bibliographic classification demands for the sake of reaching these purposes are: a useful sequence of subjects at all levels, a concise memorable notation, and a host of techniques and devices of number syn\n\nIn terms of functionality, classification systems are often described as: ... Subject headings are listed alphabetically, with numbers assigned to each heading in alphabetical order. ... Subjects are divided hierarchically, from most general to most specific. ... Subjects are divided into mutually exclusive orthogonal facets. There are few completely enumerative systems or faceted systems; most systems are a blend but favouring one type or the other. The most common classification systems, LCC and DDC, are essentially enumerative, though with some hierarchical and faceted elements (more so for DDC), especially at the broadest and most general level. The first true faceted system was the colon classification of S. R. Ranganathan. Classification types denote the classification or categorization according to the form or characteristics or qualities of a classification scheme or schemes.\n\nAs a result of differences in notation, history, use of enumeration, hierarchy, and facets, classification systems can differ in the following ways: Type of Notation: Notation can be pure (consisting of only numerals, for example) or mixed (consisting of letters and numerals, or letters, numerals, and other symbols). Expressiveness: This is the degree to which the notation can express relationship between concepts or structure. Whether they support mnemonics: For example, the number 44 in DDC notation often means it concerns some aspect of France. For example, in the Dewey classification 598.0944 concerns \"Birds in France\", the 09 signifies geographic division, and 44 represents France. Hospitality: The degree to which the system is able to accommodate new subjects. Brevity: The length of the notation to express the same concept. Speed of updates and degree of support: The better classification systems are frequently being reviewed.",

The use of categorical analysis in areas other than library and information science is also considered. The suitability of the faceted approach for humanities documentation is explored through a critical description of the FATKS (Facet Analytical Theory in Managing Knowledge Structure for Humanities) project carried out at University College London. This research focused on building a conceptual model for the subject of religion together with a relational database and search-and-browse interfaces that would support some degree of automatic classification. The paper concludes with a discussion of the differences between the conceptual model and the vocabulary used to populate it, and how, in the case of religion, the choice of terminology can create an apparent bias in the system.\n\nOur aim was to highlight the ways in which the information science literature has contributed to advancing these conversations (using a collections/service/user experience or practice lens), but also how the discussions around the sacred, lived religion, contemplation, conversion or techno‐spiritual practices (to name a few) have provided insights into information phenomena and processes. We also discuss the evolution of, and practices associated with, social media and digital practices as well as a discussion of representation (or the lack thereof) of less mainstream religious and spiritual traditions in the literature reviewed. We end with suggestions for future research directions. ...

These systems not only serve the needs of users in physical libraries but also play a critical role in organizing digital libraries and online databases. Knowledge classification and book classification represent distinct yet interconnected facets of organizing information. While both involve the systematic arrangement of content, they differ in scope, purpose, and application. Knowledge classification encompasses a broader spectrum, focusing on categorizing theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and various forms of intellectual content within a specific field of study. This process contributes to a conceptual framework that aids in understanding relationships and hierarchies within a body of knowledge.\n\nIn research databases, knowledge is often classified by fields of study, like engineering, medicine, or social sciences, with further categorization based on sub-disciplines. This allows researchers to quickly access the most relevant information for their work. Ultimately, the purpose of knowledge classification is to create an organized structure that enhances knowledge sharing, learning, and information retrieval. Book Classification is the process of organizing books in libraries or collections according to a specific system or method to ensure efficient retrieval and management. The aim is to group books based on subject, content, or other relevant attributes so that users can easily locate and access the material they need.

Knowledge classification involves systematically arranging information based on inherent relationships, concepts, or domains within a broader field of study. This classification extends beyond the confines of physical items, encompassing diverse forms of knowledge, including theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and empirical findings. On the other hand, book classification specifically pertains to the systematic organization of printed or digital materials within a library setting. Utilizing standardized systems such as the Dewey Decimal Classification or Library of Congress Classification, book classification aims to facilitate efficient storage, retrieval, and accessibility of resources for users. While knowledge classification provides a conceptual framework for understanding diverse subjects, book classification serves as a practical implemen\n\nKnowledge Classification is the systematic organization of information or knowledge into categories based on shared characteristics, themes, or concepts. This process plays a vital role in the field of information science, education, and research, as it provides a structured way to arrange complex information for easier retrieval and understanding. The primary goal of knowledge classification is to group related information together, making it more accessible and manageable for users. For instance, in libraries, knowledge is classified into broad subjects like science, literature, and history, which are further subdivided into more specific areas such as biology, chemistry, or physics. A well-known example of knowledge classification is the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system, commonly used in libraries worldwide. In this system, knowledge is divided into ten main classes, such as 000-099 for general works, 100-199 for philosophy, and 500-599 for natural sciences.",

Ranganathan ... library classification, system of arrangement adopted by a library to enable patrons to find its materials quickly and easily.\n\nGenerally, each system consists of a scheme that arranges knowledge in terms of stated principles into classes, then divisions and subdivisions.\n\nWhile cataloging provides information on the physical and topical nature of the book (or other item), classification, through assignment of a call number (consisting of class designation and author representation), locates the item in its library setting and, ideally, in the realm of knowledge. Arranging similar things in some order according to some principle unites and controls information from various sources. Classification can be distinguished by type: (1) natural, or fundamental—e.g., books by subject, (2) accidental—e.g., chronological or geographic, and (3) artificial—e.g., by alphabet, linguistic base, form, size, or numerical order. Degree of classification (e.g., close, with the most minute subdivisions, or broad, with omission of detailed subdivisions) may also characterize a system. Several systems of classification have been developed to provide the type of access and control that a particular library and its clientele need.",

For example, in an online store, products might be classified not just by category (e.g., electronics, clothing) but also by other attributes such as price, brand, size, and color. This system allows for more flexible and nuanced searches, which is especially useful in e-commerce, library databases, and digital archives. Hybrid Systems: Some knowledge classification systems combine traditional methods with modern technologies to improve the accuracy and scalability of classification. For example, a hybrid system might use a manual classification system (like DDC or LCC) for high-level organization and then incorporate machine learning algorithms to automate categorization within those frameworks. This approach balances the consistency of traditional classification with the efficiency and scalability of modern technology.\n\nKnowledge classification is the process of organizing and categorizing knowledge into distinct groups or systems based on shared characteristics or themes. This vital practice helps transform vast amounts of information into accessible and comprehensible formats, enabling effective retrieval and management. Whether in libraries, academic research, or business environments, knowledge classification plays a central role in ensuring that relevant information is easy to find and utilize. By creating structured systems, such as the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) or the Library of Congress Classification (LCC), knowledge classification allows users to quickly access resources within specific fields of study. In today’s digital age, technological advancements, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, are transforming traditional classification methods, making them more dynamic, efficient, and scalable.\n\nAs the volume and complexity of knowledge continue to grow, effective classification systems are more important than ever, enabling the organization of physical resources and the categorization of digital content, ensuring seamless access across diverse platforms. The evolution of knowledge classification, coupled with its expanding role in knowledge management, highlights its significance as a tool for organizing, preserving, and sharing information in an increasingly complex world. Knowledge classification is the systematic process of organizing information or knowledge into categories or groups based on shared characteristics or common themes. This organization helps to make vast amounts of information more accessible, manageable, and retrievable. By grouping related knowledge together, classification systems enable individuals to locate relevant information quickly and efficiently.\n\nIn libraries, for instance, classification systems like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) or the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) divide knowledge into broad subjects, which are then further broken down into more specific topics. This hierarchical structure allows library users to easily find materials within a particular field of interest. Beyond libraries, knowledge classification is essential in various domains, including research, business, and digital environments. In academic and professional settings, it helps in organizing research papers, articles, and other resources to enhance knowledge discovery. The increasing volume of digital content has led to the development of automated classification systems, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can efficiently categorize vast amounts of data across multiple platforms.",

                "text": "Hierarchical organization of a controlled vocabulary for classification purpose is referred to as faceted classification. Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan, a mathematician and considered by many as the father of modern library science, introduced the concept of faceted vocabularies (Hlava, 2014b).\n\nFacet analysis could be used for building knowledge structures which perform a range of functions when adopted as knowledge organisation system tools such as a classification scheme, thesaurus, etc. Facet analysis has a very vital role in information retrieval. Mills (2004) demonstrated the role of classification in information retrieval and in the design of classificatory structures by the application of logical division to all forms of the content of records, subject and imaginative. The natural product of such division is a faceted classification. The latter is seen not as a particular kind of library classification but the only viable form enabling the locating and relating of information to be optimally predictable. Apart from the above general uses of facet analysis, it has very specific uses too. One of them is its use in developing a task classification.\n\nIn BC all the main classes can be grouped into four main areas: philosophy, science, history, and technologies and arts. Within the main classes facets are carefully identified and listed, and in places their detail exceeds that found in enumerative schemes. To achieve the most helpful listing of subjects Bliss provided alternative locations for some subjects. For example, economic history can be located in either General History or Economics – the classifier decides which location would best suit their library’s needs. Bliss also insisted on brief notation, but classmarks for complex subjects can be very lengthy. Two characteristics of BC are worthy of mention. First, Bliss believed that an effective classification scheme should reflect the educational and scientific consensus – it should be based on the way in which specialists expect their knowledge to be organised.\n\nFor example, physics is based on mathematics and therefore must follow it in the list of main classes. Likewise, we use an understanding of physics in chemistry; astronomy depends upon ideas generated in both physics and chemistry. The listing of the main classes in BC has been much admired, although subordination breaks down in the social sciences. This methodology has merit as a theory, but it is very difficult to sustain in a linear expression of disciplines or subjects. BC may be familiar to readers, as it is used to organise the collections at the University of London’s Senate House Library. ... The above examples demonstrate how BC can achieve brevity of notation. ... Faceted classification schemes designed for use in general libraries (CC and BC) are unlikely to provide a useful classification for specialised collections: they tend to be rather complicated and are not revised frequently enough to keep pace with new areas of knowledge.\n\nMost of the information retrieval tools (classifications, subject heading lists, thesauri, etc.) developed over the latter part of the twentieth and early 21st centuries demonstrate faceted features. This is visible more in the presentation of product information on commercial websites. There is even an independent strand of theory and documentation related to the application of faceted features (Broughton, 2001). Lists of subject headings are one of the knowledge organisation tools. The Library of Congress Subject Headings is one of the famous lists of subject headings but has three main problems: (i) inconsistent syntax rules; (ii) inability to create headings that are coextensive with the topic of a work; and (iii) lack of effective displays for long lists of subdivisions under a single subject heading in OPACs and similar electronic displays. These problems could be overcome by incorporating fully faceted syntax using the facets of a modern faceted library classification (i.e.",

Each main class has ten divisions, and each division has ten sections. Hence the system can be summarized in 10 main classes, 100 divisions and 1,000 sections.\n\nUntil the nineteenth century, most libraries had closed stacks, so the library classification only served to organize the subject catalog. In the twentieth century, libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve the library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing. Some classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access, rather than for shelf location. For example, UDC which uses a complicated notation including plus, colons are more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but are more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects. Similarly faceted classification schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order. Depending on the size of the library collection, some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other.\n\nThe DDC attempts to organize all knowledge into ten main classes. The ten main classes are then further subdivided. Each main class has ten divisions, and each division has ten sections. Hence the system can be summarized in 10 main classes, 100 divisions and 1,000 sections. DDC's advantage in choosing decimals for its categories allows it to be both purely numerical and infinitely hierarchical. It also uses some aspects of a faceted classification scheme, combining elements from different parts of the structure to construct a number representing the subject content (often combining two subject elements with linking numbers and geographical and temporal elements) and form of an item rather than drawing upon a list containing each class and its meaning. Except for general works and fiction, works are classified principally by subject, with extensions for subject relationships, place, time or type of material, producing classification numbers of not less than three digits but otherwise o\n\nA library classification is a system of coding and organizing library materials (books, serials, audiovisual materials, computer files, maps, manuscripts, realia) according to their subject and allocating a call number to that information resource. Similar to classification systems used in biology, bibliographic classification systems group entities that are similar together typically arranged in a hierarchical tree structure (assuming none-faceted system). Library classification forms part of the field of library and information science. It goes hand in hand with library (descriptive) cataloging under the rubric of cataloging and classification, sometimes grouped together as technical services. The library professional who engages in the process of cataloging and classifying library materials is called a cataloger or catalog librarian. Library classification systems are one of the two tools used to facilitate subject access.\n\nDDC and UDC are also more flexible than Library of Congress Classification because of greater use of facets (via auxiliary tables) while Library of Congress Classification is almost totally enumerative. On the flip side, DDC's decimal system means that it is less hospitable to the addition of new subjects, as opposed to Library of Congress Classification which has 21 classes at the top level. Another side effect of this is that DDC notations can be very much longer compared to the equivalent class in other classification systems. Another disadvantage of DDC is that it was developed in the nineteenth century, by essentially one man, and was built on a top down approach to classify all human knowledge which made it difficult to adapt to changing fields of knowledge. In contrast, the Library of Congress Classification system was developed based mainly on the idea of literary warrant; classes were added (by individual experts in each area) only when needed for works owned by the Library of",

In this system, all knowledge is divided into 21 broad subject areas by letters of the alphabet (I, O, W, X, and Y are not used). There is no significance for the letters of the alphabet chosen for each broad subject area.\n\nLibraries house thousands of print materials, not to mention all the information that is accessible online, such as books, magazines, movies, etc. Because there are so many, it would be impossible to find anything if they weren't organized at all. To make everything easy to find and browse too, several different classification systems have been developed that are used all over the world. The SUU Sherratt Library uses both Library of Congress and the Dewey Decimal systems- Library of Congress Classification is used for the main collection and everything else except the Juvenile and Curriculum collections on the 3rd floor, which are better suited to Dewey. Knowing how to find books and materials in the library is important, especially as you start collecting books to use in your ENGL 2010 papers. In the Module 4 assignment, you will be asked to find a book as well as popular and scholarly articles.\n\nIn 1899, the United States Library of Congress created a classification scheme for books. It is called the Library of Congress Classification system (LC for short). In this system, all knowledge is divided into 21 broad subject areas by letters of the alphabet (I, O, W, X, and Y are not used). There is no significance for the letters of the alphabet chosen for each broad subject area. There is no need to memorize this classification system, but it is helpful to know how it works. Here's an outline of the major subject areas in the LC system: A second letter is then used to further subdivide subject areas. For example, the \"G\" subject category is divided into these subdivisions: Each subject subdivision is then further divided into specific topics using numbers. This combination of subject areas (letters) and numbers is called the call number for that book.\n\nTIP: Once you find an item on the shelf, browse items nearby. Books are shelved according to subject, and you may find something else useful.  · If the library catalog indicates that an item is checked in but you cannot find it on the shelf, follow these steps: Double-check the collection and call number. Look on nearby shelves to see if the item has been incorrectly shelved. Look on the red return shelves near the area. Ask someone at the Circulation Desk if the item is on a re-shelving cart. Hint: When you take an item off the shelf, don't put it back yourself. Instead, put it on a red shelf so that a librarian can make sure it is returned to its correct location. As a student at SUU, you can use your SUU ID to borrow books from other academic libraries in Utah.",

Ranganathan said that there are five fundamental categories that can be used to demonstrate the facets of a subject: personality, material, energy, space and time. He called this the PMEST formula: Personality is the most specific or focal subject. Matter is the substance, properties or materials of the subject. Energy includes the processes, operations and activities. Space relates to the geographic location of the subject. Time refers to the dates or seasons of the subject. Another example of a faceted classification scheme is the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), a complex multilingual classification that can be used in all fields of knowledge. The Universal Decimal Classification scheme was created at the end of the nineteenth century by Belgian bibliographers Paul Otlet and Henri la Fontaine.\n\nThere are few purely faceted classifications; the best known of these is the Colon Classification of Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan, a general knowledge classification for libraries. Some other faceted classifications are specific to special topics, such as the Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the faceted classification of occupational safety and health topics created by D. J. Foskett for the International Labour Organization. Many library classifications combine the enumerative and faceted classification techniques. The Dewey Decimal Classification, the Library of Congress Classification, and the Universal Decimal Classification all make use of facets at various points in their enumerated classification schedules. The allowed facets vary based on the subject area of the classification. These facets are recorded as tables that represent recurring types of subdivisions within subject areas.\n\nSearch in systems with faceted classification can enable a user to navigate information along multiple paths corresponding to different orderings of the facets. This contrasts with traditional taxonomies in which the hierarchy of categories is fixed and unchanging. It is also possible to use facets to filter search results to more quickly find desired results. The Colon Classification developed by S. R. Ranganathan is an example of general faceted classification designed to be applied to all library materials. In the Colon Classification system, a book is assigned a set of values from each independent facet. This facet formula uses punctuation marks and symbols placed between the facets to connect them. Colon classification was named after its use of the colon as the primary symbol in its notation. Ranganathan stated that hierarchical classification schemes like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) or the Library of Congress Subject Headings are too limiting and finite to use for mod\n\nWhile not strictly a classification system, the AAT uses facets similar to those of Ranganathan's Colon Classification: ... Hierarchical classification refers to the classification of objects using one single hierarchical taxonomy. Faceted classification may actually employ hierarchy in one or more of its facets, but allows for the use of more than one taxonomy to classify objects. Faceted classification systems allow the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, and enable those classifications to be applied by searchers in multiple ways, rather than in a single, predetermined order. Multiple facets may be used as a first step in a search process. For example, one may start from language or subject. Hierarchical classification systems are developed classes that are subdivided from the most general subjects to the most specific. Faceted classification systems allow for the combination of facets to filter the set of objects rapidly.\n\nA faceted classification is a classification scheme used in organizing knowledge into a systematic order. A faceted classification uses semantic categories, either general or subject-specific, that are combined to create the full classification entry. Many library classification systems use a combination of a fixed, enumerative taxonomy of concepts with subordinate facets that further refine the topic. There are two primary types of classification used for information organization: enumerative and faceted. An enumerative classification contains a full set of entries for all concepts. A faceted classification system uses a set of semantically cohesive categories that are combined as needed to create an expression of a concept. In this way, the faceted classification is not limited to already defined concepts. While this makes the classification quite flexible, it also makes the resulting expression of topics complex.",

In the representation of subjects using ...\n\nOne of the objectives of Ranganathan in developing the Faceted Classification Theory was the attempt to highlight the principles used in the development of the Colon Classification, which is the scheme used to organize the collection of the Library of the University of Madras, India. Another important concept of this theory is the concept of the fundamental categories “PMEST”, which is discussed below. Ranganathan proposed a classification scheme based on fundamental categories. According to him, these categories would allow the classification of any universe of subjects. The fundamental categories are the first part of the classification of a universe of subjects (CAMPOS, 2001). The fundamental categories defined by Ranganathan are: Personality (P), Matter (M), Energy (E), Space (S), and Time (T), also known as PMEST. In the representation of subjects using the facet formula as proposed by him, each fundamental category corresponds to the connecting symbols, according to his book, Pro\n\nThe PMEST also received criticism from Foskett (1973), who pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of this classification proposal: The analysis according to the fundamental categories of Ranganathan is often useful to determine the correct citation order of subjects in other schemes; however, we must be cautious about accepting them without adequate criticism. For example, periodicals fall into the facet Matter in librarianship, but they fall into the facet Personality in bibliography. [...] In fact, PMEST does not solve the problems related to citation order; it simply transfers them to a different stage of the analysis process. [...] However, the fact that it is possible to disagree with the use of PMEST does not mean that the citation orders found in the Colon Classification are incorrect. Most of the times, they are clear and useful, and this is the only scheme in which we can verify this fact.\n\nA disadvantage is the lack of flexibility; it is not possible to select a facet order that suits a certain group of users if it conflicts with PMEST (FOSKETT, 1973, p.267). Based on these considerations, the Classification Research Group (CRG), through cooperative studies initiated in 1952, suggested a new version of the Ranganathan PMEST, including the following categories: Types of final product, Parts, Materials, Property, Process, Operation, Agent, Space, Time, and Form of presentation (PIEDADE, 1977). This group of researchers concluded that there were no a priori categories to classify subjects. They argued that the categories are derived from the subject to be classified, in each specific context. Among the criticisms of PMEST from the CRG identified in the literature are: With regard to the fundamental categories, the CRG stated that they should be based on the nature of the subjects to be classified and that not all subjects have fundamental categories.\n\nThe CRG prefers to identify the fundamental categories by the context of the subject itself, concluding that lists of fundamental categories should not be too long or mechanically imposed on the subjects. Compared to Ranganathan’s PMEST, the fundamental categories proposed by the CRG, are, due to their flexibility, appealing to classifiers, who can shape them to specific subjects thus allowing the formation of more distinct and better defined categories (LIMA, 2004a, p.65). The fundamental categories constitute the basic and preliminary form of information organization, as previously discussed. Ranganathan also considered other relevant issues that influence the organization of knowledge; one of which is the Spiral of Scientific Method, which is discussed below. Ranganathan’s faceted classification theory was developed based on the understanding of the importance of knowledge production and the impact of new generated knowledge on classification schemes.",

Facing the limitations of Dewey’s system, where an item’s essence had to first be identified and then the item assigned to a category based on that essence, Ranganathan believed that all bibliographic resources could be organized around a more abstract variety of aspects. In 1933 Ranganathan proposed that a set of five facets applied to all knowledge: ... The type of thing. ... The constituent material of the thing. ... The action or activity of the thing. ... Where the thing occurs. ... When the thing occurs. This classification system is known as colon classification (or PMEST) because the notation used for resource identifiers uses a colon to separate the values on each facet.\n\nCondorcet and Ranganathan proposed different facets, but both hoped that their five top-level facets would be sufficient for a universal classification system. People have generally rejected the idea of universal facets, but Ranganathan’s proposals continue to influence the development of the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).[5] Faceted classification is most commonly used in narrow domains, each with its own specific facets. This makes intuitive sense because even if resources can be distinguished with a general classification, doing so requires lengthy notations, and it is much harder to add to a general classification than to a classification created specifically for a single subject area. We could probably describe shirts using the PMEST facets, but style, color, and size seem more natural. Elaine Svenonius defines facets as “groupings of terms obtained by the first division of a subject discipline into homogeneous or semantically cohesive categories.”[6] The relationshi\n\n(Ranganathan 1967).

In some respects the process and design concerns overlap with those for describing resources, and much of the advice in “The Process of Describing Resources” is relevant here.[10] We advocate a five step process for designing a faceted classification system. Define the purposes of the classification (“Determining the Purposes”, “Classification Is Purposeful”) and specify the collection of concepts or resources to be classified. For each facet, determine its logical type (“A Classification for Facets”) and possible values. Specify the order of the values for each facet so that they make sense to users; useful orderings are alphabetical, chronological, procedural, size, most popular to least popular, simple to complex, and geographical or topological.",

Conclusion • It is generally agreed that a faceted scheme is superior to an enumerative scheme. Any good faceted scheme formulated these days would clearly state the number of categories used as its basis. If one follows Ranganathan’s approach, then five fundamental categories would prove sufficient for all subjects. Otherwise one would have to determine the number of categories separately for each basic class. There is no doubt that Ranganathan’s solution has proved to be quite successful. Ranganathan’s fundamental categories have been criticized a great deal but many of the critics have not fully understood the basis of these categories. He used the order PMEST to determine the citation order for facets in a class number. This has proved to be helpful in CC as well as in other schemes. He never claimed any philosophical basis for accepting five and only five fundamental categories.\n\nBoSEU24 | Eleanor Gunn | The Top Five Regrets of the Dying · 1. FUNDAMENTAL CATEGORY PRESENTED BY SHUVRA GHOSH Roll – 07 Course: MLIS Department of Library and Information Science GUIDED BY: Prof. Subarna Kumar Das · 2. INTRODUCTION • Different persons have used the word “category” in library classification, but the concept has been used differently. Therefore, one should try to understand this term in the context in which it might have been used. Wildhack regards a category as a synonym of “point of view”, according to which a subject can be divided. Glossary and subject index defines it as “a concept of high generality and wide application which can be used to group other concepts.” D.J. Foskett goes further and regards it as a synonym of the term “faceted”, brought into popular use by Ranganathan. We may generalise that categories are used to group different concepts.\n\n4. J. Kaiser, in 1911, developed the process of systematic indexing. He developed two categories: concretes and processes In 1944, Ranganathan postulated five fundamental Categories to be used in library classification · 5. Background of Fundamental Categories • In 1952, Ranganathan published the 4th edition. This included a major new development, the introduction of the PMEST (Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time) categories. The basic idea of five categories was present in the earlier edition, but was not clearly defined. 6. Some such opinions of library Science disciplines  B.I. Palmer: ‘The concept of PMEST formula has facilitated the teaching of classification to a remarkable degree’. ‘PMEST provides a frame for the initial laying out of a new scheme of classification’.  A.C. Foskett: Analysis into Ranganathan’s Fundamental Categories is often useful in establishing the correct citation order for subjects in other schemes.\n\n8. The Sequence of the Categories  The sequence of five Fundamental Categories is based on the principle of decreasing concreteness  This forms the foundation of Colon Classification.  Ranganathan has expounded the following postulates to determine the consistent order of different facets for all subjects. Postulate of Basic Facet: Every compound subject has a basic facet. Postulate of First Facet: In a compound subject, the basic facet should be the first facet. Postulate of Isolate Facet: Each isolate facet of compound subject can be a manifestation of one and only of the five Fundamental Categories. 9. Postulate of Concreteness: The five Fundamental Categories fall into the following sequence when arranged according to their decreasing concreteness: P, M, E, S, T. Postulate of Facet Sequence within a Round: In any round of facets of a compound subject in which each of any of Fundamental Categories – Personality, Matter and Energy – occur only once, their sequence should be Person",

In the CC Facets exist within Categories. In CRG theory facets are synonymous with categories. Ranganathan emphasises that terms in the phrase “Fundamental Categories” are inseparable for its true meaning. Western theorists believe that in the concept of Rounds and Levels the hypothesis of five and only five fundamental categories is diluted.

However, their use was unsystematic and piecemeal. The DDC in its early life worked with two common categories of place and time, though the concept of categories was alien to it until veryrecently. The UDC is credited by many to be the first faceted classification, howsoever primitive, yet its facets never correspond to categories in the real sense. Work of S.R.

There are five fundamental categories: Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, and Time. These categories are used to group concepts and determine the order of facets in compound subject classifications. Personality indicates who, Matter indicates what, Energy indicates how, Space indicates where, and Time indicates when. The categories are ordered from most concrete to least concrete as Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time.

FUNDAMENTAL CATEGORY PRESENTED BY SHUVRA GHOSH Roll – 07 Course: MLIS Department of Library and Information Science GUIDED BY: Prof. Subarna Kumar Das · 2. INTRODUCTION • Different persons have used the word “category” in library classification, but the concept has been used differently.\n\nGlossary and subject index defines it as “a concept of high generality and wide application which can be used to group other concepts.” D.J. Foskett goes further and regards it as a synonym of the term “faceted”, brought into popular use by Ranganathan. We may generalise that categories are used to group different concepts. • Ranganathan uses the term “Fundamental category”. His basic postulate is concerned with the conception of fundamental categories. “There are five and only five fundamental categories – viz., Time, Space, Energy, Matter and Personality”. Thus fundamental categories are defined by enumeration only. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD  In 1876, Melvil Dewey introduced the principle of division by transferring literature, history and philology  C.A. Cutter was the first to use “common subdivisions” separated from the table of general divisions.  James Duff Brown, in his scheme entitles subject classification, included chronological divisions, as well as division of form, p\n\n4. J. Kaiser, in 1911, developed the process of systematic indexing. He developed two categories: concretes and processes In 1944, Ranganathan postulated five fundamental Categories to be used in library classification · 5. Background of Fundamental Categories • In 1952, Ranganathan published the 4th edition. This included a major new development, the introduction of the PMEST (Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time) categories. The basic idea of five categories was present in the earlier edition, but was not clearly defined. 6. Some such opinions of library Science disciplines  B.I. Palmer: ‘The concept of PMEST formula has facilitated the teaching of classification to a remarkable degree’. ‘PMEST provides a frame for the initial laying out of a new scheme of classification’.  A.C. Foskett: Analysis into Ranganathan’s Fundamental Categories is often useful in establishing the correct citation order for subjects in other schemes.",

It was an early faceted (or analytico-synthetic) classification system. The first edition of colon classification was published in 1933, followed by six more editions. It is especially used in libraries in India. Its name originates from its use of colons to separate facets into classes. Many other classification schemes, some of which are unrelated, also use colons and other punctuation to perform various functions. Originally, CC used only the colon as a separator, but since the second edition, CC has used four other punctuation symbols to identify each facet type. In CC, facets describe \"personality\" (the most specific subject), matter, energy, space, and time (PMEST). These facets are generally associated with every item in a library, and thus form a reasonably universal sorting system.\n\nCC uses five primary categories, or facets, to specify the sorting of a publication. Collectively, they are called PMEST: Other symbols can be used to indicate components of facets called isolates, and to specify complex combinations or relationships between disciplines. The following are the main classes of CC, with some subclasses, the main method used to sort the subclass using the PMEST scheme and examples showing application of PMEST.",

                "text": "For a novice scholar interested ... feature of CC. Ranganathan postulated that there are only five fundamental categories, namely: personality, matter, energy, space and time....\n\nThis may be due, at least in part, to the style of writing used in descriptions and analyses of the scheme, and the fact that Ranganathan himself uses a lot of technical terminology. However, in essence CC (excluding CC7) is elegantly constructed and quite simple to grasp, in many ways easier to grasp and to use than DDC. In any event, the purpose of this section is not to promote expert use of CC, but to further illustrate the concept of faceted classification. Some understanding and study of CC is valuable training in analysing a subject and deciding the sequence in which its constituent elements should be cited in a classmark. CC6 will be used here to devise examples of CC’s use. It is published in one small volume containing lists of common isolates, main classes and their subdivisions and an index. CC uses a mixed notation: Roman letters, Greek letters and Arabic numbers. Citation order is controlled by the facet formula PMEST.\n\nClassifiers familiar with CC can recognise the type of facet making up the notation. That is actually very important because the same symbol (particularly the same number) can mean different things in different facets. For example: ‘:4’ signifies design in the energy facet in engineering, but the number 4 denotes a different concept in the place facet, where ‘.4’ signifies Asia (with the point introducing the place facet and the 4 representing Asia). In CC7 more symbols have been introduced to signify different types of relationships within facets, making it unnecessarily complicated. As mentioned earlier, CC7 contains many errors and it has increased in complexity to a degree that makes it very difficult to use. According to Foskett it does not reflect Ranganathan’s contribution to classification theory5. It is only very rarely that all five facets would be used in classifying a work.\n\nColon Classification is a book classification scheme developed by S.R. Ranganathan. It is used in selected libraries in India and is based on the concept of five fundamental categories: personality, matter, energy, space, and time. Despite its limited growth and lack of updated editions, it continues to be of interest to library and information professionals. AI generated definition based on: Library Classification Trends in the 21st Century, 2012 ... You might find these chapters and articles relevant to this topic. ... Colon Classification (CC) is the brain child of S.R. Ranganathan. It was first published in 1933. It is now in its seventh edition, published in 1987. CC is used in selected libraries in India. Due to the lack of updated editions, newly emerging libraries are not venturing to use it. Nevertheless, LIS professionals have sustained interest in CC.\n\nThe citation analysis of Ranganathan indicates that the CC is one amongst the three most cited books of Ranganathan; the other two are Prolegomena to Library Classification and Five Laws of Library Science (Harinarayana and Raju, 2009). This indicates the continued interest of library and information professionals in the CC. Due to lack of institutional support, very few editions of the CC have been published and it has had a very limited growth. However, its revitalisation is essential and possible (Singh, 1999). For a novice scholar interested in getting primary familiarity with the CC, Singh’s (1999) article is a good starting point. The author discusses history, salient features and limitations of CC. Use of fundamental categories is an important feature of CC. Ranganathan postulated that there are only five fundamental categories, namely: personality, matter, energy, space and time.",

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is the most popular topic modeling method in the field of text mining....\n\nBackground The big data moniker is nowhere better deserved than to describe the ever-increasing prodigiousness and complexity of biological and medical datasets. New methods are needed to generate and test hypotheses, foster biological interpretation, and build validated predictors. Although multivariate techniques such as cluster analysis may allow researchers to identify groups, or clusters, of related variables, the accuracies and effectiveness of traditional clustering methods diminish for large and hyper dimensional datasets. Topic modeling is an active research field in machine learning and has been mainly used as an analytical tool to structure large textual corpora for data mining. Its ability to reduce high dimensionality to a small number of latent variables makes it suitable as a means for clustering or overcoming clustering difficulties in large biological and medical datasets.\n\nData mining has been used as a process that deals with the discovery of hidden knowledge and unexpected patterns, particularly the discovery of optimal clusters and interesting irregularities in large data bases. Topic modeling is an active research field in machine learning and has been widely used as an analytical tool to interpret large datasets in text mining [19–21, 24] and image retrieval [23, 33]. Here we applied topic modeling in a different way to reduce the dimensions of large datasets to yield more effective clustering analysis in various biological and biomedical data. We have proposed three topic model-derived clustering methods and evaluated the efficacies/effectiveness on datasets from three different application fields. It was found that one method yielded better results than the others for each dataset (Table 3 Table S1 and S2 in Additional file 1). The topic model-derived clustering based on highest probable topic assignment used the LDA-derived topics as the clusters\n\nUnlike the hierarchical clustering, the number of clusters in a k-means analysis must be specified a priori. Simulation studies have shown that k-means algorithms and other non-hierarchical clustering algorithms perform poorly when random initial seeds are used; their performance is improved when the results from hierarchical methods are used to form the initial partition [17]. Thus, hierarchical and non-hierarchical techniques should be applied as complementary rather than as competing clustering techniques. Topic modeling algorithms are statistical methods that analyze the words of documents to discover the themes that pervade a large collection of documents [18]. The basic idea of topic modeling is that a document is a mixture of latent topics and each topic is expressed by a distribution of words. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is the most popular topic modeling method in the field of text mining.\n\nIn this method, LDA was utilized as a feature extraction approach for cluster analysis. The LDA-derived topics were considered as the new features of datasets. The sample-topic matrix (Figure 1a) was treated as a new representation of the original dataset. Based on the sample-topic matrix, conventional clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms were used for the clustering analysis. In this method, the topic-word matrix (Figure 1b) was used for feature selection. The words with high probabilities in each LDA-derived topic were selected to express the dataset. Therefore, a reduced dataset with selected words (variables) was generated, based on which the conventional clustering could be conducted. In this study, the top 50 high probability words were chosen in each topic. For each of the 30 clusters, the average of PFGE band presence (value of 1) /absence (value of 0) of all the sample isolates at 60 designated band locations was calculated as the chara",

Topic modeling is a powerful technique for unsupervised analysis of large document collections. Topic models have a wide range of applications including tag recommendation, text categorization, keyword extraction and similarity search in the text mining, information retrieval and statistical language modeling. The research on topic modeling is gain...\n\nTraditional topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), faces limitations in capturing the semantic relationships in the text document although it has been widely applied in text mining. BERTopic, created in 2022, leveraged advances in deep learning and can capture the contextual relationships between words. In this work, we integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) modules to LDA and BERTopic and provided a comprehensive comparison on the analysis of prescription opioid-related cardiovascular risks in women. Opioid use can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems in women such as arrhythmia, hypotension etc. 1,837 abstracts were retrieved and downloaded from PubMed as of April 2024 using three Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) words: “opioid,” “cardiovascular,” and “women.” Machine Learning of Language Toolkit (MALLET) was employed for the implementation of LDA.\n\nHowever, data storage and the complexity in interpreting enormous amounts of data obtained with NGS still remain a computational challenge to researchers, as for each sample, the number of different and very large analysis files are generated directly from the raw sequence read file to the final result file. NGS resultant data is very complex, and its interpretation requires expert bioinformatics assistance, as a large number of mutations are identified from samples, but to differentiate clinically significant mutations among them with appropriate use of validation methods is a challenging task. This review is intended to provide researchers with a complete overview of NGS along with knowledge of how the tools will be employed, and insight into identification and interpretation of cancer mutations for clinical diagnostics.

The results of the t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) plots showed that the clusters created from BERTopic were more compact and well-separated, representing improved coherence and distinctiveness between the topics. Our findings indicated that AI algorithms could augment both traditional and contemporary topic modeling techniques. In addition, BERTopic has the connection port for ChatGPT-4-Turbo or other large language models in its algorithm for automatic interpretation, while with LDA interpretation must be manually, and needs special procedures for data pre-processing and stop words exclusion.",

Join our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.\n\nLatent Dirichlet allocation is a topic modeling technique for uncovering the central topics and their distributions across a set of documents. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)—not to be confused with linear discriminant analysis in machine learning—is a Bayesian approach to topic modeling. Simply put, LDA is a conditional, probabilistic form of topic modeling. Topic modeling is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that applies unsupervised learning on large text datasets in order to produce a summary set of terms derived from those documents. These terms are meant to represent the collection’s overall primary set of topics. In this way, topic models aim to uncover the latent topics or themes characterizing a collection of documents.1 · Users can readily generate LDA topic models using scikit-learn’s (or, sklearn’s) Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and gensim in Python.\n\nLDA’s distinguishing feature is each document’s probabilistic distribution over a shared set of topics. As with other topic modeling approaches, these topics and their distribution in each document is not known. Topic modeling is unsupervised; there is no manually labeled data guiding the analysis. By uncovering hidden topical structures, LDA ultimately annotates documents across a collection. These annotations (that is the uncovered topics) can be used to classify texts. In this way, LDA aids information retrieval systems by automating the annotation and organization of large collections of documents.7 ... Join our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights. ... As with many text mining techniques in data science, text preprocessing vastly improves LDA model results.\n\nMuch like other topic modeling approaches, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), LDA approaches documents across corpora as bag of words. This means LDA ignores word order and context. Instead, it focuses on how often words occur and co-occur within each individual document.3 Word frequency and co-occurrence are modeled in the document-term matrix. Here, documents are rows and individual words are columns, or vice-versa. Each cell’s value indicates the frequency with which a given word appears in each document.4 · Using the document-term matrix, the LDA algorithm generates topic distributions (that is lists of keywords with respective probabilities) according to word frequency and co-occurrences. By tracking frequency of co-occurrence, LDA assumes words that occur together are likely part of similar topics. The algorithm then assigns document-topic distributions based on the clusters of words that appear in the given document.5 ·\n\nIn other words, our hypothetical LDA model assumes these are the topics and proportions of those topics used to generate the model. Of course, polysemous words in particular create problems for such discrete categorizations—for example, alien may refer to a human immigrant or an extra-terrestrial creature. In such cases, how does the LDA algorithm determine to which topic the word (and by extension, the document) belongs? When assigning topics to words, the LDA algorithm uses what is known as Gibbs sampling. The Gibbs sampling formula is: Understanding this equation’s exact operations and hyperparameters requires foundational knowledge in statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques (the latter often employed in reinforcement learning). Nevertheless, we can summarize the equation’s principal components: The first ratio expresses the probability of topic t in document d.",

                "text": "LDA is a generalization of older approach of probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA), The pLSA model is equivalent to LDA under a uniform Dirichlet prior distribution. pLSA relies on only the first two assumptions above and does not care about the remainder. While both methods are similar in principle and require the user to specify the number of topics to be discovered before the start of training (as with K-means clustering) LDA has the following advantages over pLSA: LDA yields better disambiguation of words and a more precise assignment of documents to topics. Computing probabilities\n\nOne application of LDA in machine learning - specifically, topic discovery, a subproblem in natural language processing – is to discover topics in a collection of documents, and then automatically classify any individual document within the collection in terms of how \"relevant\" it is to each of the discovered topics. A topic is considered to be a set of terms (i.e., individual words or phrases) that, taken together, suggest a shared theme. For example, in a document collection related to pet animals, the terms dog, spaniel, beagle, golden retriever, puppy, bark, and woof would suggest a DOG_related theme, while the terms cat, siamese, Maine coon, tabby, manx, meow, purr, and kitten would suggest a CAT_related theme. There may be many more topics in the collection – e.g., related to diet, grooming, healthcare, behavior, etc. that we do not discuss for simplicity's sake.\n\nIf the document collection is sufficiently large, LDA will discover such sets of terms (i.e., topics) based upon the co-occurrence of individual terms, though the task of assigning a meaningful label to an individual topic (i.e., that all the terms are DOG_related) is up to the user, and often requires specialized knowledge (e.g., for collection of technical documents). The LDA approach assumes that: The semantic content of a document is composed by combining one or more terms from one or more topics. Certain terms are ambiguous, belonging to more than one topic, with different probability. (For example, the term training can apply to both dogs and cats, but are more likely to refer to dogs, which are used as work animals or participate in obedience or skill competitions.) However, in a document, the accompanying presence of specific neighboring terms (which belong to only one topic) will disambiguate their usage.\n\nIn natural language processing, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a Bayesian network (and, therefore, a generative statistical model) for modeling automatically extracted topics in textual corpora. The LDA is an example of a Bayesian topic model. In this, observations (e.g., words) are collected into documents, and each word's presence is attributable to one of the document's topics. Each document will contain a small number of topics. In the context of population genetics, LDA was proposed by J. K. Pritchard, M. Stephens and P. Donnelly in 2000. LDA was applied in machine learning by David Blei, Andrew Ng and Michael I. Jordan in 2003. In population genetics, the model is used to detect the presence of structured genetic variation in a group of individuals. The model assumes that alleles carried by individuals under study have origin in various extant or past populations.\n\nThe model and various inference algorithms allow scientists to estimate the allele frequencies in those source populations and the origin of alleles carried by individuals under study. The source populations can be interpreted ex-post in terms of various evolutionary scenarios. In association studies, detecting the presence of genetic structure is considered a necessary preliminary step to avoid confounding. In clinical psychology research, LDA has been used to identify common themes of self-images experienced by young people in social situations. Other social scientists have used LDA to examine large sets of topical data from discussions on social media (e.g., tweets about prescription drugs). Additionally, supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation with covariates (SLDAX) has been specifically developed to combine latent topics identified in texts with other manifest variables.",

In a good topic structure of LDA, every topic is an understandable, meaningful and compact semantic cluster, and is exclusive to each other. The higher layer needs fewer topics, but the topics are abstract and overlap with each other, which results in too many correlations to retain the discriminability; On the other hand, the lower layer · We have validated that the best K of LDA is correlated with the distances between topics in Section 3. In this section, we integrate the idea of clustering based on density [5] into our method, and propose to adaptively select the appropriate number of topics in LDA based on topic density. The aim of clustering based on density is that the similarity will be as large as possible in the intra-cluster, but as small as possible between inter-clusters.\n\nIn the topic model, the number of topics is crucial to the performance, but finding appropriate value for it is very difficult. In this paper, motivated by the limitation that LDA ignores the topic correlation, we further study the connection between the LDA performance and the topic correlation, and demonstrate that the LDA model performs best when the average cosine distance of topics reaches the minimum.

Her research interests focus on multimedia retrieval and machine learning.\n\nAlthough these models can describe the topic correlations flexibly, they all face the same difficulty to determine the number of topics (parameter K). This parameter will determine the topic structure extracted by the topic model. Y. Teh et al. [13] found an application of hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to automatically learn the number of topics in LDA model. Moreover, Li et al. [9] proposed a nonparametric Bayesian prior for PAM based on a variant of the HDP. This work is based on the nonparametric nature of the Bayesian analysis tool known as the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model. But this method needs constructing a HDP model and a LDA model for the same dataset. In this paper, we propose a new method to adaptively select the best LDA model based on topic density, and integrate this task and the model parameter estimation into the same framework.\n\nThis study contains three main contributions: (1) establishing the technological infrastructure (authors, journals & conferences, publications, and organizations) of solar forecasting via the top 1000 papers returned by a Google Scholar search; (2) consolidating the frequently-used abbreviations in solar forecasting by mining the full texts of 249 ScienceDirect publications; and (3) identifying key innovations in recent advances in solar forecasting (e.g., shadow camera, forecast reconciliation). As most of the steps involved in the above analysis are automated via an application programming interface, the presented method can be transferred to other solar engineering topics, or any other scientific domain, by means of changing the search word.

Each document is a \"mixture of topics\" and each topic is a \"distribution of words.\"\n\n**Hierarchical Clustering:** Traditional methods like k-means work well when combined with hierarchical approaches - \"hierarchical and non-hierarchical techniques should be applied as complementary rather than competing.\"\n\n## 🔄 The Clustering vs. Tagging Solution\n\n**Why Classical Systems Avoid Tag Chaos:**\n\n1. **Controlled Vocabulary:** Classification provides \"logical approach to arrangement\" with \"systematic order according to subject content.\"\n\n2. **Faceted Flexibility:** Faceted classification involves \"categorizing information based on multiple attributes simultaneously\" but within defined structures.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Topic modeling \"reduces high dimensionality to a small number of latent variables\" making it \"suitable as a means for clustering.\"\n\n## 🛠️ Synthesis for Your Knowledge Garden\n\n**The Most Promising Hybrid Approach:**\n\nCombine Ranganathan's **PMEST** with modern **LDA topic modeling**:\n\n```\nYour Garden Schema:\n├── Personality (WHO) → Palestine, Family, Self, Mentors\n├── Matter (WHAT) → Concepts, Questions, Stories, Resources  \n├── Energy (HOW) → Tensions, Processes, Methods, Insights\n├── Space (WHERE) → Contexts, Domains, Communities\n└── Time (WHEN) → Stages, Seasons, Deadlines\n\nAuto-Generated Clusters via LDA:\n└── Topic 1: \"Meaning-making & Ontology\" \n└── Topic 2: \"Family & Values Integration\"\n└── Topic 3: \"Professional Development\"\n└── Topic 4: \"Spiritual Practice & Attention\"\n```\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- **PMEST** provides stable structure (no endless tag proliferation)\n- **LDA** discovers emergent themes automatically\n- **Hierarchical clustering** groups related items\n- **Faceted browsing** lets you navigate multiple dimensions\n\n## 🎯 Practical Implementation\n\n**Instead of tagging everything with random keywords:**\n\n1. **Use PMEST as your base schema** (5 mandatory facets)\n2. **Auto-cluster content with LDA** (4-8 discovered topics)\n3. **Apply hierarchical organization** within each facet\n4. **Enable faceted search** across dimensions\n\nThis gives you the **rigor** you crave (proven library science) with the **flexibility** you need (computational discovery), while **avoiding tag chaos** through controlled vocabularies and systematic clustering.\n\nWhat resonates most? The classical hierarchical structure, the faceted flexibility, or the computational clustering approach?",

I've gathered substantial information on all the topics Bilal asked about. Let me synthesize this into a comprehensive response covering:\n\n1. LLM embeddings for clustering/knowledge organization\n2. The \"5 W's + H\" framework for ontology \n3. OWL (Web Ontology Language) approach\n4. The connection to epistemology \n5. Key researchers in the field\n\nThis is rich material that will help him understand the cutting-edge research landscape.Brilliant questions, Bilal! You're hitting the exact intersection where computational semantics meets deep philosophical inquiry. Let me map this landscape for you.\n\n## 🧠 LLM Embeddings for Knowledge Organization\n\n**The Research Breakthrough:** LLM embeddings are revolutionizing clustering because they \"excel at capturing subtleties in structured language\" and provide \"a refined structural understanding of text data compared to traditional methods.\" Studies show \"LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity\" over traditional approaches like TF-IDF.\n\n**Why This Matters for Your Garden:**\nModern LLMs \"provide an unprecedented depth and breadth of knowledge encoded in word and sentence-level embeddings\" trained on \"extensive datasets to capture a broad spectrum of human language variations.\"\n\n**Key Technical Advantage:** LLM embeddings convert text into \"a vector of numbers representing the meaning and context\" which \"quantifies a concept numerically\" - enabling \"semantic document search, classification, and translation.\"\n\n**Your Use Case:** Recent research shows LLM embeddings can \"capture latent information about\" concepts, \"enabling more comprehensive knowledge discovery\" and \"bypassing complex ontology mapping steps.\"\n\n## 🤔 The 5 W's + H: Are They Comprehensive?\n\n**Historical Foundation:** The framework traces back to Aristotle, who identified elements for \"distinguishing voluntary or involuntary action\": \"Who did it, by what aids or instruments he did it (with), what he did, where he did it, why he did it, how and when he did it.\"\n\n**Classical Expansion:** Later scholars like Hermagoras claimed \"all hypotheses are derived from these seven circumstances\" and \"no hypothetical question, or question involving particular persons and actions, can arise without reference to these circumstances.\"\n\n**But Is It Complete?**\n\nThe classical framework may miss crucial dimensions for knowledge work:\n- **How much/How many** (quantity/scale)\n- **What kind** (qualitative distinctions) \n- **What if** (counterfactuals)\n- **What for** (purpose/intention - deeper than \"why\")\n\n**For Your Garden:** The 5 W's + H provide solid **journalism-level completeness** but may need expansion for **philosophical rigor**. Consider adding **quantitative, qualitative, conditional, and purposive dimensions**.\n\n## 🌐 OWL's Ontology Architecture \n\n**Core Structure:** OWL organizes knowledge using \"classes\" (sets of objects), \"properties\" (relationships), and \"individuals\" (instances). It \"consists of a set of axioms which place constraints on sets of individuals and the types of relationships permitted between them.\"\n\n**Three-Tier System:** OWL offers three levels: **OWL Lite** (basic hierarchies), **OWL DL** (maximum expressiveness with computational completeness), and **OWL Full** (maximum flexibility, allowing \"classes to be used as instances\").\n\n**Why It's Powerful:** Unlike programming class hierarchies, ontologies \"are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources\" and \"are expected to be evolving almost constantly.\"\n\n**For Your Use:** OWL's **axiom-based constraints** could enforce the \"rigor\" you seek - it can express complex relationships like \"Palestine-related work gets priority\" or \"Family values must connect to professional decisions.\"\n\n## 🧭 Ontology ↔ Epistemology Connection\n\n**The Fundamental Link:** Ontology \"intersects areas such as metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language, as it considers how knowledge, language, and perception relate to the nature of reality.\" Epistemology \"creates the foundation researchers use when approaching a certain topic\" by asking \"What do you know? or How do you know it?\"\n\n**For Knowledge Gardens:** Your question about \"what is knowable\" touches the heart of epistemology - **how do we validate that our garden captures genuine insights vs. noise?**\n\n## 👥 Five Key Researchers & Their Core Ideas\n\n**1. Tom Gruber (Stanford)** - The Foundational Vision\nDefined ontology as \"a specification of a conceptualization\" - essentially \"a description of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents.\" Established that \"ontologies are design artifacts and should be amenable to engineering methodologies.\"\n\n**2. Barry Smith (University at Buffalo)** - Philosophical Rigor\nChampions **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)** - argues that ontology \"as a branch of philosophy is the science of what is, of the kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes and relations in every area of reality.\" Bridges philosophical and computational ontology.\n\n**3. Nicola Guarino (CNR, Italy)** - Formal Foundations  \nCo-developed the distinction between \"ontological level\" (what exists) and \"epistemological level\" (how we know). Emphasizes \"formal ontological principles in the current practice of knowledge engineering.\"\n\n**4. Shiyali Ranganathan** - Systematic Classification\nCreated the **PMEST framework** (Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time) - claimed these \"five fundamental categories\" are sufficient for organizing all knowledge. Pioneered **faceted classification** as alternative to rigid hierarchies.\n\n**5. John Vervaeke (University of Toronto)** - Relevance & Meaning\nFocuses on **relevance realization** - how we determine what's meaningful to attend to. His work connects attention, wisdom, and meaning-making (directly relevant to your \"attentional policies\").\n\n## 🔄 Synthesis for Your Garden\n\n**The Sweet Spot:** Combine **LLM embeddings** (for semantic discovery) + **PMEST facets** (for systematic organization) + **OWL axioms** (for rigorous constraints) + **epistemological reflection** (for validation).\n\n**Your Comprehensive Framework:**\n```\nOntological Dimensions (What exists in your garden):\n├── WHO (Personality): Palestine, family, mentors, colleagues\n├── WHAT (Matter): concepts, tensions, questions, insights  \n├── HOW (Energy): processes, methods, practices, dialogues\n├── WHERE (Space): contexts, domains, communities, stages\n├── WHEN (Time): seasons, deadlines, development phases\n└── WHY (Purpose): values, intentions, spiritual connections\n\nEpistemological Validation (How you know it's real):\n├── Rigor tests: Does this insight withstand scrutiny?\n├── Usefulness tests: Does this serve Palestine/family/growth?\n├── Integration tests: Does this connect to existing knowledge?\n└── Emergence tests: Does this generate new possibilities?\n```\n\n**Research Domain:** You're exploring **\"Computational Wisdom Systems\"** - the intersection of semantic AI, knowledge organization, spiritual epistemology, and meaningful action. Very few people are working on this exact combination.\n\nThe **5 W's + H** provide a solid foundation, but for your purposes, consider expanding to **7 W's + 2 H's**: Who, What, When, Where, Why, What-if, What-for, How, How-much.\n\nDoes this framework feel both rigorous enough and alive enough for your knowledge garden?",

The embedding captures semantic relationships between words and phrases, providing a dense and continuous representation of text that is well-suited for clustering tasks. However, these methodologies often require tailored fine-tuning to adapt to specific domains or datasets, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Besides, the choice of clustering hyperparameters is greatly influenced by human expertise and can have a significant impact on the final outcomes. Recent state-of-the-art LLMs, such as the GPT series (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023), have showcased remarkable reasoning performance across a wide range of NLP tasks.

It facilitates efficient organization and analysis of information by grouping similar texts based on their representations. However, implementing this approach necessitates fine-tuned embedders for downstream data and sophisticated similarity metrics. To address this issue, this study presents a novel framework for text clustering that effectively leverages the in-context learning capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of fine-tuning embedders, we propose to transform the text clustering into a classification task via LLM. First, we prompt LLM to generate potential labels for a given dataset. Second, after integrating similar labels generated by the LLM, we prompt the LLM to assign the most appropriate label to each sample in the dataset.\n\nThe first metric is Accuracy (ACC), calculated by aligning true labels and predicted clusters using the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) and calculating the percentage of correct assignments. Second metric is Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), which uses mutual information to measure the similarity between the true and predicted clusters and normalize it by the average of the entropy. Lastly, we use Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which takes into account the possibility of random cluster assignments by adjusting the Rand Index for the chance grouping of elements. K-means. We directly apply K-means on embeddings extracted from E5-large (Wang et al., 2022) and Instructor-large (Su et al., 2022). We run the clustering 5 times with different seeds and calculate the average result. IDAS (De Raedt et al., 2023) identifies prototypes that represent the latent intents and independently summarizes them into labels using LLMs.\n\nThen, it encodes the concatenation of sentences and summaries for clustering. PAS (Wang et al., 2023) develops a three-stage algorithm Propose-Assign-Select by prompting LLMs to generate goal-related explanations, determine whether each explanation supports each sample, and use integer linear programming to select clusters such that each sample belongs to one single cluster. Keyphrase Clustering is the best performing clustering model proposed by (Viswanathan et al., 2024), which expands the expression by generating keyphrases using LLM. ClusterLLM (Zhang et al., 2023) prompts LLM for insights on similar data points and fine-tunes small embedders using the LLM’s choice. It also uses GPT-3.5 to guide the clustering granularity by determining whether two data points belong to the same category. For comparison, we select the best performing model ClusterLLM-I-iter reported in the paper.",

Read it now.\n\nCommon techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and word embeddings (like Word2Vec or GloVe) which capture the semantic meaning of words. Embeddings are produced for data sets to provide a dense representation of words in a continuous vector space, enhancing clustering results by facilitating more effective grouping of features. TF-IDF helps in identifying the importance of words in a document relative to a corpus. A clustering algorithm, such as K-Means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN, is applied to the numerical data. The algorithm groups the data points (documents) into clusters based on their similarity. For example, K-Means aims to minimize the distance between points within a cluster and the cluster centroid, while DBSCAN groups points based on density. Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings can enhance traditional text clustering methods by focusing on conceptual relevance, making them more effective for text clustering.\n\nFor example, text clustering can reveal emerging trends in social media conversations or identify common topics in academic research. Improves the organization and retrieval of information by grouping similar documents, thus making search engines more effective. This leads to more relevant search results and a better user experience.

OpenAI API integration is not free, so I purchased $5 worth of tokens. In all my experimentation and testing, I have only used up 10 cents of that amount since the datasets are small. If any cost is prohibitive, LangChain supports different LLMs (both online and local). The first step is taking an input PDF document and splitting it into smaller chunks. This is required since most LLMs have a character limit. Smaller blocks of text also aid in semantic analysis since larger blocks may contain many concepts and clustering will be less accurate. LangChain supports many options and configurations for splitting a document. I experimented with three different splitters and with different chunk sizes.

Each step will share the key pieces of code needed and show examples for executing that functionality in the program so you can explore and iterate as well. The goal of this post is to demonstrate the power of embeddings and help you get started quickly, leveraging it for your own applications. If you speak code and not text, jump right to the GitHub repo. The program is built in Python which has a rich ecosystem for exploring LLMs and machine learning concepts.\n\nBy converting the embeddings into a Numpy array we can use its mean function to calculate the array of averages. For each cluster calculate this average and pass this vector into the vector DB similarity_search_with_score_by_vector method to find the words that best describe that cluster.\n\nUnder the covers, LLMs take the prompted text and turn it into an embedding which is a vector of numbers representing the meaning and context of the tokens processed by the model. In essence (in my non-ML expert view), the embedding represents the model’s conceptual understanding of the input. It then uses this to generate its output.

Among the more lightweight models, BERT demonstrates leading performance.\n\nAbstract:Text clustering is an important method for organising the increasing volume of digital content, aiding in the structuring and discovery of hidden patterns in uncategorised data. The effectiveness of text clustering largely depends on the selection of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. This study argues that recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance this task. The research investigates how different textual embeddings, particularly those utilised in LLMs, and various clustering algorithms influence the clustering of text datasets. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of embeddings on clustering results, the role of dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and the adjustment of model size. The findings indicate that LLM embeddings are superior at capturing subtleties in structured language.\n\nAbstract page for arXiv paper 2403.15112: Text Clustering with Large Language Model Embeddings\n\nMost LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity and provide a more informative silhouette score, reflecting a refined structural understanding of text data compared to traditional methods.

Additionally, it was observed that increasing model dimensionality and employing summarisation techniques do not consistently enhance clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategies require careful consideration for practical application. These results highlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representation and computational feasibility in text clustering applications.

While GPT-based embeddings are powerful, they often require cloud-based operation, which raises privacy concerns, especially when handling sensitive medical data. Traditionally, ontology provides an important knowledge representation platform that classifies the knowledge of entities in a specific domain and the relations among these entities. For example, the VO classifies the list of vaccines and their attributes, such as vaccine types, and attributes, such as live or non-live. Furthermore, ontology can be used to support clustering analysis based on the ontology semantic similarity analysis. However, the development of ontology is time-consuming, and the information recorded in ontology may be incomplete. In this study, we used the FDA vaccine package insert documents to build up LLM embeddings and further used them to perform vaccine clustering\n\nFurthermore, LLM-derived text embeddings were used to develop a Lasso logistic regression model to predict whether a vaccine is “Live” or “Non-Live”. The term “Non-Live” refers to all vaccines that do not contain live organisms, including inactivated and mRNA vaccines. A comparative analysis showed that, despite similar clustering patterns, the nomic-embed-text model outperformed the other. It achieved 80.00% sensitivity, 83.06% specificity, and 81.89% accuracy in a 10-fold cross-validation. Many AE patterns, with examples demonstrated, were identified from our analysis with AE LLM embeddings. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs for automated AE extraction and analysis, and LLM text embeddings capture latent information about AEs, enabling more comprehensive knowledge discovery. Our findings suggest that LLMs demonstrate substantial potential for improving vaccine safety and public health research.\n\nHierarchical clustering was employed to group vaccines based on these embeddings, allowing us to examine the alignment between LLM-derived similarities and established vaccine characteristics. To investigate the characteristics of LLM text-embedding methods, we compared the vaccine similarity patterns generated by LLM with those obtained using traditional ontology-based semantic methods. Moreover, we explored the potential of LLM-generated embeddings for machine learning tasks by training a classifier to predict whether a vaccine was classified as “Live” or “Non-Live”. This approach aimed to evaluate the LLM’s capability to extract latent information from text, highlighting its potential for faster vaccine analysis. By leveraging text embeddings, this method bypasses the complexity of ontology mapping, enabling efficient exploration and knowledge discovery from biomedical annotation texts relevant to our research.\n\nFirstly, we leveraged LLMs to efficiently process and extract itemized adverse events from FDA-approved vaccine package inserts with high accuracy. Secondly, we compared two methods, namely an ontology-based semantic similarity analysis and an LLM text embedding method, for analyzing and classifying the relationships between these vaccines based on their adverse event profiles. Lastly, we explored the potential of LLM text embeddings to classify vaccines based on vaccine attributes, such as live or non-live. Our findings demonstrate that LLM text embeddings can quickly analyze biomedical descriptive texts, bypassing complex ontology mapping steps. The embedding-based methods can also complement ontology-based clustering and classification. This approach helps uncover potential vaccine classifications, encapsulates latent information within the text [29], and may serve as a valuable tool for medical knowledge discovery.",

Metaphysics deals with questions like &quot;what exists?&quot; and &quot;what is the nature of reality?&quot;. One of five traditional branches of philosophy, metaphysics is concerned with exploring existence through properties, entities and relations such as those between particulars and universals, intrinsic and extrinsic properties, or essence and existence. Metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discuss\n\nOntologies are also not limited to conservative definitions, that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world (Enderton, 1972). To specify a conceptualization, one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms. Recent experimental ontology frameworks have also explored resonance-based AI-human co-evolution structures, such as IAMF (Illumination AI Matrix Framework). Though not yet widely adopted in academic discourse, such models propose phased approaches to ethical harmonization and structural emergence. As refinement of Gruber's definition Feilmayr and Wöß (2016) stated: \"An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity.\"\n\nA survey of ontology visualization methods is presented by Katifori et al. An updated survey of ontology visualization methods and tools was published by Dudás et al. The most established ontology visualization methods, namely indented tree and graph visualization are evaluated by Fu et al. A visual language for ontologies represented in OWL is specified by the Visual Notation for OWL Ontologies (VOWL). Ontology engineering (also called ontology building) is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain. It is a subfield of knowledge engineering that studies the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tools and languages that support them. Ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained in software applications, and organizational procedures for a particular domain.\n\nNIFSTD Ontologies from the Neuroscience Information Framework: a modular set of ontologies for the neuroscience domain.

The first occurrence in English of ontology as recorded by the OED (Oxford English Dictionary, online edition, 2008) came in Archeologia Philosophica Nova or New Principles of Philosophy by Gideon Harvey. Since the mid-1970s, researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have recognized that knowledge engineering is the key to building large and powerful AI systems. AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning, which was only marginally successful. In the 1980s, the AI community began to use the term ontology to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge-based systems.\n\nIn information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definitions of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, or entities that pertain to one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of terms and relational expressions that represent the entities in that subject area. The field which studies ontologies so conceived is sometimes referred to as applied ontology. Every academic discipline or field, in creating its terminology, thereby lays the groundwork for an ontology. Each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. Improved ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain, interoperability of data systems, and discoverability of data.",

The framework is commonly employed in journalism, research, and police investigations to establish a structure for comprehensively covering a specific topic. A report must respond to these queries in the form of an interrogative sentence to comply with the Five W’s principle: ... Additionally, some writers include a sixth question, “how,” which can be addressed by “what,” “where,” or “when.” · Each question necessitates a factual answer, and it’s essential to include all relevant information to ensure the report is comprehensive. It’s critical to note that none of the questions can get answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” · Children often use this type of inquiry when beginning a writing project.\n\nBy addressing the Five Ws and one H, we can better comprehend a subject and effectively communicate information. The 5 W’s and H framework is a valuable tool in multiple domains, including journalism, research, police investigations, and project management. Here are some key points about this approach: Initially designed for journalism, the 5 W’s and H method involves answering Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How questions in the lead paragraph of news articles. Today, it remains widely used in journalism to gather all necessary information on a given topic. In project management, the 5 W’s and H technique help teams create a shared vision and focus on critical aspects. The aspects include stakeholders, project scope, purpose, and methodology; by asking questions like Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How, project managers can comprehensively understand the project, anticipate potential challenges, and devise strategies to overcome them.\n\nThe Who question in the 5 W’s and H Framework refers to identifying the person, group, or organization involved in or responsible for the subject or problem. ... Answering the Who question helps you identify the key stakeholders involved in the problem and determine their roles and responsibilities in finding a solution. The What question in the 5 W’s and H Framework identifies the subject or problem. ... Answering the What question is essential for gaining a clear understanding of the subject or problem and defining the scope of the investigation. The When question in the 5 W’s and H Framework refers to identifying the time or period when the subject or problem occurred or will occur. ... Answering When the question is vital for determining the urgency and timeline for solving the problem and identifying any relevant events or factors that may have contributed to the problem.\n\nThe 5 W’s and H framework is a versatile tool in many different contexts, including: Journalism: To gather information and write news articles by answering Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How questions. Project management: To help teams create a shared vision and focus on essential aspects of a project, such as stakeholders, project scope, purpose, and methodology. Case management investigations: Plan, report, and present findings clearly and concisely. Strategy level: To design or improve a market penetration strategy. Management level: To improve organization and processes during brainstorming sessions. Quality level: As a problem-resolution support tool. Innovation level: To boost the emergence of solutions and ideas in the cause of progress.

Ontologies also enrich semantic web mining, mining health records for insights, fraud detection and semantic publishing. In a nutshell, ontologies are frameworks for representing shareable and reusable knowledge across a domain. Their ability to describe relationships and their high interconnectedness make them the bases for modeling high-quality, linked and coherent data.

It ensures a common understanding of information and makes explicit domain assumptions thus allowing organizations to make better sense of their data. ... An ontology is a formal description of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships that hold between them. To enable such a description, we need to formally specify components such as individuals (instances of objects), classes, attributes and relations as well as restrictions, rules and axioms. As a result, ontologies do not only introduce a sharable and reusable knowledge representation but can also add new knowledge about the domain. The ontology data model can be applied to a set of individual facts to create a knowledge graph – a collection of entities, where the types and the relationships between them are expressed by nodes and edges between these nodes, By describing the \n\nAs one of the building blocks of Semantic Technology, ontologies are part of the W3C standards stack for the Semantic Web. They provide users with the necessary structure to link one piece of information to other pieces of information on the Web of Linked Data. Because they are used to specify common modeling representations of data from distributed and heterogeneous systems and databases, ontologies enable database interoperability, cross-database search and smooth knowledge management. Some of the major characteristics of ontologies are that they ensure a common understanding of information and that they make explicit domain assumptions. As a result, the interconnectedness and interoperability of the model make it invaluable for addressing the challenges of accessing and querying data in large organizations. Also, by improving metadata and provenance, and thus allowing organizations to make better sense of their data, ontologies enhance data quality.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an uptake of expressing ontologies using ontology languages such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL is a semantic web computational logic-based language, designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things and the relations between them. It also provides detailed, consistent and meaningful distinctions between classes, properties and relationships. By specifying both object classes and relationship properties as well as their hierarchical order, OWL enriches ontology modeling in semantic graph databases, also known as RDF triplestores. OWL, used together with an OWL reasoner in such triplestores, enables consistency checks (to find any logical inconsistencies) and ensures satisfiability checks (to find whether there are classes that cannot have instances). Also, OWL comes equipped with means for defining equivalence and difference between instances, classes and properties.",

                "text": "In recent years the development of ontologiesexplicit formal specifications of the terms in the domain and relations among them (Gruber 1993)has been moving from the realm of Artificial-Intelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have become common on the World-Wide Web. The ontologies on the Web range from large taxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for sale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is developing the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for encoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching for information. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in conjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by extending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the Web (Hendler and McGuinness 2000).\n\nThe class Wine has too many direct subclasses and, indeed, for the ontology to reflect the different types of wine in a more organized manner, Medoc should be a subclass of Bordeaux and Cotes dOr should be a subclass of Burgundy. Also having such intermediate categories as Red wine and White wine would also reflect the conceptual model of the domain of wines that many people have (Figure 7b). However, if no natural classes exist to group concepts in the long list of siblings, there is no need to create artificial classesjust leave the classes the way they are. After all, the ontology is a reflection of the real world, and if no categorization exists in the real world, then the ontology should reflect that. Figure 7. Categorizing wines. Having all the wines and types of wine versus having several levels of categorization. Most knowledge-representation systems allow multiple inheritance in the class hierarchy: a class can be a subclass of several classes.\n\nFor example, an ontology underlying an electronic medical-record system may include a classification of various diseases. This classification may be just thata hierarchy of terms, without properties (or with the same set of properties). In that case, it is still useful to organize the terms in a hierarchy rather than a flat list because it will (1) allow easier exploration and navigation and (2) enable a doctor to choose easily a level of generality of the term that is appropriate for the situation. Another reason to introduce new classes without any new properties is to model concepts among which domain experts commonly make a distinction even though we may have decided not to model the distinction itself. Since we use ontologies to facilitate communication among domain experts and between domain experts and knowledge-based systems we would like to reflect the experts view of the domain in the ontology.\n\nThat is, if we want to represent details adjacency and location information (which is different for each rib) as well as specific functions that each rib playa and organs it protects, we want the classes. If we are modeling anatomy at a slightly lesser level of generality, and all ribs are very similar as far as our potential applications are concerned (we just talk about which rib is broken on the X-Ray without implications for other parts of the body), we may want to simplify our hierarchy and have just the class Rib, with two slots: lateral position, order. Deciding whether a particular concept is a class in an ontology or an individual instance depends on what the potential applications of the ontology are. Deciding where classes end and individual instances begin starts with deciding what is the lowest level of granularity in the representation. The level of granularity is in turn determined by a potential application of the ontology. In other words, what are the most specific ite",

Companies can then harness this skills ontology framework to prioritize critical skills, update job design, efficiently deploy talent, and match employees to projects and roles based on their capabilities and expertise. While the terms “skills ontology” and “skill taxonomy” might sound similar, the table explains why these phrases cannot be used interchangeably. One of the key differences is that an ontology is a more formal and detailed way of representing skills. While a taxonomy simply lists and organizes skills in a hierarchy, an ontology specifies the relationship between skills and the properties that they possess. Another difference is that a skills ontology is typically designed to be more comprehensive and inclusive than a taxonomy.\n\nThe best skills ontologies are self-evolving, which means that the more information you collect about workforce skills and job needs, the more accurate and updated your ontology will become. There’s no need to manually update these frameworks; instead, leaders can feel confident that the depth of their skills information is going to continue to grow with their organization. Leaders can harness their skills ontology to develop a comprehensive skill-building strategy that equips their entire workforce with in-demand expertise. Here are 4 steps to get started: An employee who has written a few lines of code doesn’t have the same level of expertise as colleagues in software engineering. Rather than solely indicating which skills employees possess, leaders must go the extra mile to determine their competency levels. While many businesses once relied on tests to capture employees’ skill levels, visionary organizations are now harnessing skills intelligence tools to gain in-depth insight into\n\nYet, many executives are running into the same challenge as they embark on their transformation journeys: uncertainty about the skills their workforce currently has and the knowledge they need to acquire. Rather than looking for a quick fix to drive organizational change, the most impactful transformation initiatives start from within a company. They’re rooted in an understanding of the business’s shifting skill needs and the ability to identify how talent can be redeployed to meet emerging challenges. Since both in-demand competencies and internal talent pools are ever-changing, leaders can’t rely on familiar mindsets and static technologies to push their transformation agendas forward. Instead, they must harness a new generation of AI-powered tools that can adapt to shifting skills needs in real-time—which is where skills ontology frameworks come into play.\n\nSkills ontologies give leaders clearer insights into the types of skills they already have, and in turn, the capabilities they will either need to hire or upskill and reskill for. Rather than guessing what skills an organization needs to hire for, skills ontologies help executives clearly define the knowledge a candidate must possess in order to be successful in a given role. A skills ontology creates an internal database for skills sourcing and identification, which allows managers and leaders to quickly pinpoint and call upon the talent that possesses the specific expertise they’re looking for. Once leaders gain insight into the skills their people have and the competencies they need to hone, they can begin devising and implementing skill-building initiatives that align with these priorities. Skills ontologies give visibility into emerging trends, or where gaps sit to inform where to invest in development and upskilling and plan for future-fit roles.",

As far back as 1913, reporters were taught that the lead should answer these questions: ... In modern times, journalism students are still taught that these are the fundamental ...\n\nFor in acts we must take note of who did it, by what aids or instruments he did it (with), what he did, where he did it, why he did it, how and when he did it. For Aristotle, the elements are used to distinguish voluntary or involuntary action, a crucial distinction for him. These elements of circumstances are used by Aristotle as a framework to describe and evaluate moral action in terms of What was or should be done, Who did it, How it was done, Where it happened, and most importantly for what reason (Why), and so on for all the other elements: Therefore it is not a pointless endeavor to divide these circumstances by kind and number; (1) the Who, (2) the What, (3) around what place (Where) or (4) in which time something happens (When), and sometimes (5) with what, such as an instrument (With), (6) for the sake of what (Why), such as saving a life, and (7) the (How), such as gently or violently…And it seems that the most important circumstances are those just listed, including the Why\n\nI mean, for instance (a particular circumstance or movement or action), How could we advise the Athenians whether they should go to war or not, if we did not know their strength (How much), whether it was naval or military or both (What kind), and how great it is (How many), what their revenues amount to (With), Who their friends and enemies are (Who), what wars, too they have waged (What), and with what success; and so on. Essentially, these elements of circumstances provide a theoretical framework that can be used to particularize, explain or predict any given set of circumstances of action. Hermagoras went so far as to claim that all hypotheses are derived from these seven circumstances: In other words, no hypothetical question, or question involving particular persons and actions, can arise without reference to these circumstances, and no demonstration of such a question can be made without using them.\n\nIn the United States in the 19th century, William Cleaver Wilkinson popularized the \"Three Ws\" – What? Why? What of it? – as a method of Bible study in the 1880s, although he did not claim originality. This eventually became the \"Five W's\", but the application was rather different from that in journalism: \"What? Why? What of it?\" is a plan of study of alliterative methods for the teacher emphasized by Professor W.C. Wilkinson not as original with himself but as of venerable authority. \"It is, in fact,\" he says, \"an almost immemorial orator's analysis. First the facts, next the proof of the facts, then the consequences of the facts. This analysis has often been expanded into one known as \"The Five W's\": \"When? Where? Who? What? Why?\" Hereby attention is called, in the study of any lesson: to the date of its incidents; to their place or locality; to the person speaking or spoken to, or to the persons introduced, in the narrative; to the incidents or statements of the text; and, finally, \n\nWikisource has original text related to this article: ... The \"Five W's\" (and one H) were memorialized by Rudyard Kipling in his Just So Stories (1902), in which a poem, accompanying the tale of The Elephant's Child, opens with: I keep six honest serving-men (They taught me all I knew); Their names are What and Why and When And How and Where and Who.",

The 5 Ws and H approach to information-gathering originated as a tool to help journalists write their stories. A common rule among newspaper editors is that reporters should answer all six of these questions in the lead paragraph of their news articles.

(And does either the time or location the crime took place to provide any additional clues or insights into the crime itself?) How did it take place? (What method did the killer use? Where was the murder weapon? What other details do we know about the crime?) Why did the murderer do it? (Did the killer have a rational motive, such as a plan to profit from the crime? Or was it irrational, such as the act of a serial killer?) Who did it? (The answers to the questions above will increase the reporter’s chances of learning this final piece of the story: who was responsible?)

The key challenge was integrating internal survey response data with internal investment documents to answer nuanced competency questions such as, “What are the most frequently cited factors when considering a contraceptive method?” and “Which factors most strongly influence adoption or rejection?” This required a system that could not only ingest and organize heterogeneous data but also enable executives to visualize and act upon insights derived from complex cross-document analyses.

If this is not the case (most of the time), then you will have to question yourself, or even your potential buyers in one way or another. The 5 W’s method helps you identify the needs of your targets, and you will, therefore, be able to offer them an item that is much more relevant to their needs than the competition. At the end of the day, it means more sales and an increase in market share. In marketing, the 5 W’s method is widely used to improve the relevance of actions. It is often implemented when KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) are not up to par. This typically means that the marketing actions and campaigns of the company are not adapted to the audience. Many marketers instinctively begin with questions about what and where, as in 'what' their advertising should say or 'where' it should appear.\n\nSteve McKee , https://www.mckeewallwork.com/insight/the-five-ws-of-marketing/ Today, personalized marketing is a very strong trend driven by the collection of personal data, client demands, and legal and technical constraints to counter abusive marketing actions. Like in marketing, this system makes you familiar with your target. It is frequent in this field to make a table with several columns for each type of target. In this case, it is called a persona (people representative of a customer segment), or a buyer persona. As we saw above, the 5 W’s method has been widely used in journalism since the beginning of the 20th century in the United States. This method makes it possible to create informative content as opposed to literary content that we are used to with novels and historical narratives. This method makes it possible to share technical, exhaustive, objective and verified information that is appreciated by readers who seek relevant information.\n\nAsana and Trello are two very popular project management tools for Agile and collaborative organizations.

These axioms provide semantics by allowing systems to infer additional information based on the data explicitly provided.\n\nOntologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases. The OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF).\n\nA 2006 survey of ontologies available on the web collected 688 OWL ontologies. Of these, 199 were OWL Lite, 149 were OWL DL and 337 OWL Full (by syntax). They found that 19 ontologies had in excess of 2,000 classes, and that 6 had more than 10,000. The same survey collected 587 RDFS vocabularies. An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. — Tom Gruber, A Translation Approach to Portable Ontology Specifications · The data described by an ontology in the OWL family is interpreted as a set of \"individuals\" and a set of \"property assertions\" which relate these individuals to each other. An ontology consists of a set of axioms which place constraints on sets of individuals (called \"classes\") and the types of relationships permitted between them. These axioms provide semantics by allowing systems to infer additional information based on the data explicitly provided.\n\nOWL ontologies can import other ontologies, adding information from the imported ontology to the current ontology. An ontology describing families might include axioms stating that a \"hasMother\" property is only present between two individuals when \"hasParent\" is also present, and that individuals of class \"HasTypeOBlood\" are never related via \"hasParent\" to members of the \"HasTypeABBlood\" class. If it is stated that the individual Harriet is related via \"hasMother\" to the individual Sue, and that Harriet is a member of the \"HasTypeOBlood\" class, then it can be inferred that Sue is not a member of \"HasTypeABBlood\". This is, however, only true if the concepts of \"Parent\" and \"Mother\" only mean biological parent or mother and not social parent or mother. To choose a subset of first-order logic that is decidable, propositional logic was used, increasing its power by adding logics represented by convention with acronyms: The W3C-endorsed OWL specification includes the definition of three v\n\nOWL DL is designed to provide the maximum expressiveness possible while retaining computational completeness (either φ or ¬φ holds), decidability (there is an effective procedure to determine whether φ is derivable or not), and the availability of practical reasoning algorithms. OWL DL includes all OWL language constructs, but they can be used only under certain restrictions (for example, number restrictions may not be placed upon properties which are declared to be transitive; and while a class may be a subclass of many classes, a class cannot be an instance of another class). OWL DL is so named due to its correspondence with description logic, a field of research that has studied the logics that form the formal foundation of OWL. ... OWL Full is based on a different semantics from OWL Lite or OWL DL, and was designed to preserve some compatibility with RDF Schema. For example, in OWL Full a class can be treated simultaneously as a collection of individuals and as an individual in its\n\nThe Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.

See the OWL Semantics and Abstract Syntax document [OWL S&AS] for details. All axioms must be well-formed, with no missing or extra components, and must form a tree-like structure.\n\nThe Web Ontology Language OWL is a semantic markup language for publishing and sharing ontologies on the World Wide Web. OWL is developed as a vocabulary extension of RDF (the Resource Description Framework) and is derived from the DAML+OIL Web Ontology Language. This document contains a structured informal description of the full set of OWL language constructs and is meant to serve as a reference for OWL users who want to construct OWL ontologies. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and other interested parties, and it has been endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web. This is one of six parts of the W3C Recommendation for OWL, the Web Ontology Language.\n\nOWL Full and OWL DL support the same set of OWL language constructs. Their difference lies in restrictions on the use of some of those features and on the use of RDF features. OWL Full allows free mixing of OWL with RDF Schema and, like RDF Schema, does not enforce a strict separation of classes, properties, individuals and data values. OWL DL puts constraints on the mixing with RDF and requires disjointness of classes, properties, individuals and data values. The main reason for having the OWL DL sublanguage is that tool builders have developed powerful reasoning systems which support ontologies constrained by the restrictions required for OWL DL. For the formal definitions of the differences between OWL Full and OWL DL the reader is referred to the Semantics and Abstract Syntax document [OWL S&AS]. Sec. 8.2 \"OWL DL\" summarizes the differences between OWL Full and OWL DL.\n\nNOTE: RDF users upgrading to OWL should be aware that OWL Lite is not simply an extension of RDF Schema. OWL Lite is a light version of OWL DL and puts constraints on the use of the RDF vocabulary (e.g., disjointness of classes, properties, etc.). OWL Full is designed for maximal RDF compatibility and is therefore the natural place to start for RDF users. When opting for either OWL DL or OWL Lite one should consider whether the advantages of OWL DL/Lite (e.g., reasoning support) outweigh the DL/Lite restrictions on the use of OWL and RDF constructs. NOTE: OWL Lite is defined in this document as a number of additional restrictions on OWL DL. This mean that, OWL DL constructs are also part of OWL Lite, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Sec. 8.3.provides a summary of these additional OWL Lite restrictions. An OWL ontology is an RDF graph [RDF Concepts], which is in turn a set of RDF triples.",

OWL is part of the growing stack of W3C recommendations related to the Semantic Web. XML provides a surface syntax for structured documents, but imposes no semantic constraints on the meaning of these documents. XML Schema is a language for restricting the structure of XML documents. RDF is a datamodel for objects (\"resources\") and relations between them, provides a simple semantics for this datamodel, and these datamodels can be represented in an XML syntax. RDF Schema is a vocabulary for describing properties and classes of RDF resources, with a semantics for generalization-hierarchies of such properties and classes. OWL adds more vocabulary for describing properties and classes: among others, relations between classes (e.g. disjointness), cardinality (e.g. \"exactly one\"), equality, richer typing of properties, characteristics of properties (e.g.\n\nOntology developers adopting OWL should consider which sublanguage best suits their needs. The choice between OWL Lite and OWL DL depends on the extent to which users require the more-expressive constructs provided by OWL DL and OWL Full. The choice between OWL DL and OWL Full mainly depends on the extent to which users require the meta-modeling facilities of RDF Schema (e.g. defining classes of classes, or attaching properties to classes). When using OWL Full as compared to OWL DL, reasoning support is less predictable since complete OWL Full implementations do not currently exist.OWL Full can be viewed as an extension of RDF, while OWL Lite and OWL DL can be viewed as extensions of a restricted view of RDF. Every OWL (Lite, DL, Full) document is an RDF document, and every RDF document is an OWL Full document, but only some RDF documents wll be a legal OWL Lite or OWL DL document.\n\nintersectionOf: OWL Lite allows intersections of named classes and restrictions. For example, the class EmployedPerson can be described as the intersectionOf Person and EmployedThings (which could be defined as things that have a minimum cardinality of 1 on the hasEmployer property). From this a reasoner may deduce that any particular EmployedPerson has at least one employer. OWL uses the RDF mechanisms for data values. See the OWL Guide for a more detailed description. OWL Lite supports notions of ontology inclusion and relationships and attaching information to ontologies. See the OWL Reference for details and the OWL Guide for examples. Both OWL DL and OWL Full use the same vocabulary although OWL DL is subject to some restrictions. Roughly, OWL DL requires type separation (a class can not also be an individual or property, a property can not also be an individual or class).\n\ncomplex classes : In many constructs, OWL Lite restricts the syntax to single class names (e.g. in subClassOf or equivalentClass statements). OWL Full extends this restriction to allow arbitrarily complex class descriptions, consisting of enumerated classes, property restrictions, and Boolean combinations. Also, OWL Full allows classes to be used as instances (and OWL DL and OWL Lite do not). For more on this topic, see the \"Design for Use\" section of the Guide document. This document provides an overview of the Web Ontology Language by providing a brief introduction to why one might need a Web ontology language and how OWL fits in with related W3C languages. It also provides a brief description of the three OWL sublanguages: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full along with a feature synopsis for each of the languages.

OWL 2 ontologies provide classes, properties, individuals, and data values and are stored as Semantic Web documents. OWL 2 ontologies can be used along with information written in RDF, and OWL 2 ontologies themselves are primarily exchanged as RDF documents. The OWL 2 Document Overview describes the overall state of OWL 2, and should be read before other OWL 2 documents. The meaningful constructs provided by OWL 2 are defined in terms of their structure. As well, a functional-style syntax is defined for these constructs, with examples and informal descriptions. One can reason with OWL 2 ontologies under either the RDF-Based Semantics [OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics] or the Direct Semantics [OWL 2 Direct Semantics]. If certain restrictions on OWL 2 ontologies are satisfied and the ontology is in OWL 2 DL, reasoning under the Direct Semantics can be implemented using \n\nFinally, this document defines OWL 2 DL — the subset of OWL 2 with favorable computational properties. Each RDF graph obtained by applying the RDF mapping to an OWL 2 DL ontology can be converted back into the conceptual structure defined in this document by means of the reverse RDF mapping as OWL 2 RDF Mapping. An OWL 2 ontology is a formal description of a domain of interest. OWL 2 ontologies consist of the following three different syntactic categories: Entities, such as classes, properties, and individuals, are identified by IRIs. They form the primitive terms of an ontology and constitute the basic elements of an ontology. For example, a class a:Person can be used to represent the set of all people. Similarly, the object property a:parentOf can be used to represent the parent-child relationship. Finally, the individual a:Peter can be used to represent a particular person called “Peter”. Expressions represent complex notions in the domain being described.\n\nThese three syntactic categories are used to express the logical part of OWL 2 ontologies — that is, they are interpreted under a precisely defined semantics that allows useful inferences to be drawn. For example, if an individual a:Peter is an instance of the class a:Student, and a:Student is a subclass of a:Person, then from the OWL 2 semantics one can derive that a:Peter is also an instance of a:Person. In addition, entities, axioms, and ontologies can be annotated in OWL 2. For example, a class can be given a human-readable label that provides a more descriptive name for the class. Annotations have no effect on the logical aspects of an ontology — that is, for the purposes of the OWL 2 semantics, annotations are treated as not being present. Instead, the use of annotations is left to the applications that use OWL 2. For example, a graphical user interface might choose to visualize a class using one of its labels.\n\nThis document defines the OWL 2 language. The core part of this specification — called the structural specification — is independent of the concrete exchange syntaxes for OWL 2 ontologies. The structural specification describes the conceptual structure of OWL 2 ontologies and thus provides a normative abstract representation for all (normative and nonnormative) syntaxes of OWL 2. This allows for a clear separation of the essential features of the language from issues related to any particular syntax. Furthermore, such a structural specification of OWL 2 provides the foundation for the implementation of OWL 2 tools such as APIs and reasoners. Each OWL 2 ontology represented as an instance of this conceptual structure can be converted into an RDF graph OWL 2 RDF Mapping; conversely, most OWL 2 ontologies represented as RDF graphs can be converted into the conceptual structure defined in this document as OWL 2 RDF Mapping.",

An OWL class represents an ontological concept and can have properties and relationships to other classes. A specific project creates instances of these classes to describe entities in their system. Once an ontology for a domain has been authored in OWL, there are a variety of tools available to reason about the instances within that domain. SysML on the other hand is used to describe the structure and the behavior of the system being developed, and drive the development of system components. There is increased interest in leveraging the expressive capability of SysML models with the formalisms and associated reasoning capability provided by OWL models. Some organizations are taking the approach of mapping their ontologies onto SysML profiles.\n\nThe basic assumptions behind the Semantic Web—the AAA, Open World, and Nonunique Naming assumptions—place very specific restrictions on the modeling language. The structure of RDF is in the form of statements with familiar grammatical constructs like subject, predicate, and object. The structure of Web Ontology Language (OWL) includes familiar concepts like class, subClassOf, and property. But the meaning of a model is given by the inference rules of OWL, which incorporate the assumptions of the Semantic Web. One can tell if one has built a useful model, one that conforms to these assumptions, by making sure that the inferences it supports are useful and meaningful. According to the AAA slogan, one cannot say that any of the practices in the chapter are “errors” because Anyone can say Anything about Any topic. All of these models are valid expressions in RDF/OWL.\n\nClasses in OWL ontologies are mapped onto stereotypes in one or more SysML profiles. A SysML model with the ontology stereotypes applied can then be transformed into OWL so that OWL-based tools can reason about the model. Both file-based and API-based exchange can be used to exchange the data between the SysML modeling tool and the OWL reasoning tools. One such example is the effort by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to establish a mapping between SysML and OWL to support flight project development [74]. The basis of the transformation is a mapping from the concepts and properties in the JPL ontologies to SysML modeling concepts. For example, the JPL concept of Component is mapped to a SysML block, and the JPL concept of Work Package is mapped to a SysML package. ...

By offering a well-structured way to model real-world domains, OWL supports interoperability across various systems and platforms, making it ideal for applications in sectors like healthcare, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence. OWL builds on the Resource Description Framework (RDF), a framework for representing information on the web. While RDF allows for simple, triple-based data representation (subject-predicate-object), OWL extends this by enabling more complex relationships, constraints, and class hierarchies. For example, while RDF might represent a simple statement like “John is a Person,” OWL can express more advanced logic, such as “All humans are mortal” or “A Person can only have two biological parents.” OWL works by defining ontologies using a combination of syntaxes.\n\nLearn the essentials of Web Ontology Language (OWL) with this comprehensive guide to semantic data modeling and reasoning for knowledge.\n\nThe Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a powerful tool designed to represent knowledge in a machine-readable way, making it a key enabler for the Semantic Web. It defines ontologies, formal representations of concepts within a domain and the relationships between them. OWL enhances the expressiveness of RDF (Resource Description Framework), allowing for more sophisticated data modelling. At its core, OWL uses ‘classes’, ‘properties’, and ‘individuals’ to describe and organize information. Classes represent sets of objects (e.g., “Person” or “Vehicle”), while properties define relationships between these objects, either linking one object to another (object properties) or to data values (data properties). Individuals are instances of these classes. It comes in two major versions: OWL 1 and 2. The First one introduced foundational capabilities, but 2, released in 2009, provided greater expressiveness and functionality.\n\nThe most common ones are RDF/XML, which integrates well with web technologies; OWL Functional Syntax, designed for human readability; and Manchester Syntax, which strikes a balance between simplicity and expressiveness. These syntaxes allow OWL to define concepts like disjoint classes, cardinality restrictions (e.g., “a person must have at least one parent”), and equivalence between classes. In addition, OWL provides mechanisms for reasoning. Reasoners, software tools that process OWL ontologies, can infer new information that isn’t explicitly stated using defined relationships and constraints. This capability allows OWL to go beyond data description to logical inference, making it ideal for applications like knowledge management, AI, and semantic search systems. OWL offers a higher level of expressiveness and formal semantics compared to simpler frameworks like RDF or RDF Schema (RDFS).",

                "text": "In information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definitions of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, or entities that pertain to one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of terms and relational expressions that represent the entities in that subject area. The field which studies ontologies so conceived is sometimes referred to as applied ontology. Every academic discipline or field, in creating its terminol\n\nWhat ontologies in both information science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, including both objects and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in information science), and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible (e.g., foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy, BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence). Applied ontology is considered by some as a successor to prior work in philosophy. However many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than with philosophical first principles, or with questions such as the mode of existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects (e.g., perdurantism and endurantism) may be ontologically more primary than processes.\n\nOntology is a branch of philosophy and intersects areas such as metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language, as it considers how knowledge, language, and perception relate to the nature of reality. Metaphysics deals with questions like \"what exists?\" and \"what is the nature of reality?\". One of five traditional branches of philosophy, metaphysics is concerned with exploring existence through properties, entities and relations such as those between particulars and universals, intrinsic and extrinsic properties, or essence and existence. Metaphysics has been an ongoing topic of discussion since recorded history. The compound word ontology combines onto-, from the Greek ὄν, on (gen. ὄντος, ontos), i.e. \"being; that which is\", which is the present participle of the verb εἰμί, eimí, i.e. \"to be, I am\", and -λογία, -logia, i.e.\n\nEpistemological assumptions, which in research asks \"What do you know? or \"How do you know it?\", creates the foundation researchers use when approaching a certain topic or area for potential research. As epistemology is directly linked to knowledge and how we come about accepting certain truths, individuals conducting academic research must understand what allows them to begin theory building. Simply, epistemological assumptions force researchers to question how they arrive at the knowledge they have. An ontology language is a formal language used to encode an ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based: Common Algebraic Specification Language is a general logic-based specification language developed within the IFIP working group 1.3 \"Foundations of System Specifications\" and is a de facto standard language for software specifications.\n\nIn 1993, the widely cited web page and paper \"Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing\" by Tom Gruber used ontology as a technical term in computer science closely related to earlier idea of semantic networks and taxonomies. Gruber introduced the term as a specification of a conceptualization: An ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions, but more general. And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy. Attempting to distance ontologies from taxonomies and similar efforts in knowledge modeling that rely on classes and inheritance, Gruber stated (1993): Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes, class definitions, and the subsumption relation, but ontologies need not be limited to these forms.\n\nAs refinement of Gruber's definition Feilmayr and Wöß (2016) stated: \"An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization that is characterized by high semantic expressiveness required for increased complexity.\" Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities, regardless of the language in which they are expressed. Most ontologies describe individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes and relations. A domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology) represents concepts which belong to a realm of the world, such as biology or politics. Each domain ontology typically models domain-specific definitions of terms. For example, the word card has many different meanings. An ontology about the domain of poker would model the \"playing card\" meaning of the word, while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the \"punched card\" and \"video card\" meanings.",

Let me map this landscape for you.\n\n## 🧠 LLM Embeddings for Knowledge Organization\n\n**The Research Breakthrough:** LLM embeddings are revolutionizing clustering because they \"excel at capturing subtleties in structured language\" and provide \"a refined structural understanding of text data compared to traditional methods.\" Studies show \"LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity\" over traditional approaches like TF-IDF.\n\n**Why This Matters for Your Garden:**\nModern LLMs \"provide an unprecedented depth and breadth of knowledge encoded in word and sentence-level embeddings\" trained on \"extensive datasets to capture a broad spectrum of human language variations.\"\n\n**Key Technical Advantage:** LLM embeddings convert text into \"a vector of numbers representing the meaning and context\" which \"quantifies a concept numerically\" - enabling \"semantic document search, classification, and translation.\"\n\n**Your Use Case:** Recent research shows LLM embeddings can \"capture latent information about\" concepts, \"enabling more comprehensive knowledge discovery\" and \"bypassing complex ontology mapping steps.\"\n\n## 🤔 The 5 W's + H: Are They Comprehensive?\n\n**Historical Foundation:** The framework traces back to Aristotle, who identified elements for \"distinguishing voluntary or involuntary action\": \"Who did it, by what aids or instruments he did it (with), what he did, where he did it, why he did it, how and when he did it.\"\n\n**Classical Expansion:** Later scholars like Hermagoras claimed \"all hypotheses are derived from these seven circumstances\" and \"no hypothetical question, or question involving particular persons and actions, can arise without reference to these circumstances.\"\n\n**But Is It Complete?**\n\nThe classical framework may miss crucial dimensions for knowledge work:\n- **How much/How many** (quantity/scale)\n- **What kind** (qualitative distinctions) \n- **What if** (counterfactuals)\n- **What for** (purpose/intention - deeper than \"why\")\n\n**For Your Garden:** The 5 W's + H provide solid **journalism-level completeness** but may need expansion for **philosophical rigor**. Consider adding **quantitative, qualitative, conditional, and purposive dimensions**.\n\n## 🌐 OWL's Ontology Architecture \n\n**Core Structure:** OWL organizes knowledge using \"classes\" (sets of objects), \"properties\" (relationships), and \"individuals\" (instances). It \"consists of a set of axioms which place constraints on sets of individuals and the types of relationships permitted between them.\"\n\n**Three-Tier System:** OWL offers three levels: **OWL Lite** (basic hierarchies), **OWL DL** (maximum expressiveness with computational completeness), and **OWL Full** (maximum flexibility, allowing \"classes to be used as instances\").\n\n**Why It's Powerful:** Unlike programming class hierarchies, ontologies \"are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources\" and \"are expected to be evolving almost constantly.\"\n\n**For Your Use:** OWL's **axiom-based constraints** could enforce the \"rigor\" you seek - it can express complex relationships like \"Palestine-related work gets priority\" or \"Family values must connect to professional decisions.\"\n\n## 🧭 Ontology ↔ Epistemology Connection\n\n**The Fundamental Link:** Ontology \"intersects areas such as metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language, as it considers how knowledge, language, and perception relate to the nature of reality.\" Epistemology \"creates the foundation researchers use when approaching a certain topic\" by asking \"What do you know? or How do you know it?\"\n\n**For Knowledge Gardens:** Your question about \"what is knowable\" touches the heart of epistemology - **how do we validate that our garden captures genuine insights vs. noise?**\n\n## 👥 Five Key Researchers & Their Core Ideas\n\n**1. Tom Gruber (Stanford)** - The Foundational Vision\nDefined ontology as \"a specification of a conceptualization\" - essentially \"a description of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents.\" Established that \"ontologies are design artifacts and should be amenable to engineering methodologies.\"\n\n**2. Barry Smith (University at Buffalo)** - Philosophical Rigor\nChampions **Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)** - argues that ontology \"as a branch of philosophy is the science of what is, of the kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes and relations in every area of reality.\" Bridges philosophical and computational ontology.\n\n**3. Nicola Guarino (CNR, Italy)** - Formal Foundations  \nCo-developed the distinction between \"ontological level\" (what exists) and \"epistemological level\" (how we know). Emphasizes \"formal ontological principles in the current practice of knowledge engineering.\"\n\n**4. Shiyali Ranganathan** - Systematic Classification\nCreated the **PMEST framework** (Personality, Matter, Energy, Space, Time) - claimed these \"five fundamental categories\" are sufficient for organizing all knowledge. Pioneered **faceted classification** as alternative to rigid hierarchies.\n\n**5. John Vervaeke (University of Toronto)** - Relevance & Meaning\nFocuses on **relevance realization** - how we determine what's meaningful to attend to. His work connects attention, wisdom, and meaning-making (directly relevant to your \"attentional policies\").\n\n## 🔄 Synthesis for Your Garden\n\n**The Sweet Spot:** Combine **LLM embeddings** (for semantic discovery) + **PMEST facets** (for systematic organization) + **OWL axioms** (for rigorous constraints) + **epistemological reflection** (for validation).\n\n**Your Comprehensive Framework:**\n```\nOntological Dimensions (What exists in your garden):\n├── WHO (Personality): Palestine, family, mentors, colleagues\n├── WHAT (Matter): concepts, tensions, questions, insights  \n├── HOW (Energy): processes, methods, practices, dialogues\n├── WHERE (Space): contexts, domains, communities, stages\n├── WHEN (Time): seasons, deadlines, development phases\n└── WHY (Purpose): values, intentions, spiritual connections\n\nEpistemological Validation (How you know it's real):\n├── Rigor tests: Does this insight withstand scrutiny?\n├── Usefulness tests: Does this serve Palestine/family/growth?\n├── Integration tests: Does this connect to existing knowledge?\n└── Emergence tests: Does this generate new possibilities?\n```\n\n**Research Domain:** You're exploring **\"Computational Wisdom Systems\"** - the intersection of semantic AI, knowledge organization, spiritual epistemology, and meaningful action. Very few people are working on this exact combination.\n\nThe **5 W's + H** provide a solid foundation, but for your purposes, consider expanding to **7 W's + 2 H's**: Who, What, When, Where, Why, What-if, What-for, How, How-much.\n\nDoes this framework feel both rigorous enough and alive enough for your knowledge garden?",

In \r\nthis blog post, we will provide examples of how to use the new gist model of quantitative data \r\nreleased in gist version 13. After illustrating key concepts, we will look at how all the pieces fit \r\ntogether and provide one concrete end-to-end example.\r\nLet’s examine the following:\r\n1. How is a measurement represented?\r\n2. Which units can be used to measure a given characteristic?\r\n3. How do I convert a value from one unit to another?\r\n4. How are units defined in terms of the International System of Units?\r\nFirst, we want to be able to represent a fact like:\r\n“The patio has an area of 144 square feet.”\r\nThe area of the patio is represented using this pattern:\r\n… where:\r\n• A magnitude is an amount of some measurable characteristic.\r\n• An aspect is a measurable characteristic like cost, area, or mass.\r\n• A unit of measure is a standard amount used to measure or specify things, like US \r\ndollar, meter, or kilogram.\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 2\r\nSecond, we need to be able to identify which units are applicable for measuring a given aspect. \r\nConsider a few simple examples, the aspects distance, energy, and cost:\r\nFor every aspect there is a group of applicable units. For example, there is a group of units that \r\nmeasure energy density:\r\n… where:\r\nA unit group is a collection of units that can be used to measure the same aspect.\r\nA common scenario is that we want to validate the combination of aspect and unit of measure. All \r\nwe need to do is check to see if the unit of measure is a member of the unit group for the aspect:\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 3\r\nNext, we want to be able to convert measurements from one unit to another. A conversion like \r\nthis makes sense only when the two units measure the same aspect. For example, we can convert \r\npounds to kilograms because they both measure mass, but we can’t convert pounds to seconds. \r\nWhen a conversion is possible, the rule is simple:\r\nThere is an exception to the rule above for units of measure that do not have a common zero \r\nvalue. For example, 0 degrees Fahrenheit is not the same temperature as 0 degrees Kelvin.\r\n1. To convert from Kelvin to Fahrenheit, reverse the steps: first divide by the conversion factor \r\nand then subtract the offset.\r\n2. To convert a value from Fahrenheit to Celsius, first use the conversion above to convert to \r\nKelvin, and then convert from Kelvin to Celsius.\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 4\r\nNext, we will look at how units of measure are related to the International System of Units, which \r\ndefines a small set of base units (kilogram, meter, second, Kelvin, etc.) and states:\r\nNotice that every expression on the right side is a multiple of kilogram meter2 per second3\r\n. We can \r\navoid redundancy by “attaching” the exponents of base units to the unit group. That way, when \r\nadding a new unit of measure to the unit group for power there is no need to re-enter the data for \r\nthe exponents.\r\nThe example also illustrates the conversion factors; each conversion factor appears as the initial \r\nnumber on the right-hand side. In other words:\r\nThe conversion factors and exponents allow units of measure to be expressed in terms of the \r\nInternational System of Units, which acts as something of a Rosetta Stone for understanding units \r\nof measure.\r\nOne additional bit of modeling allows calculations of the form:\r\n(45 miles per hour) x 3 hours = 135 miles\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 5\r\nTo enable this type of math, we represent miles per hour directly in terms of miles and hours:\r\nPutting the pieces together:\r\nHere is the standard representation of a magnitude:\r\nEvery aspect has a group of units that can be used to measure it:\r\nEvery member of a unit group can be represented as a multiple of the same product of powers of \r\nbase units of the International System of Units:\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 6\r\nwhere X can be:\r\n• Ampere\r\n• Bit\r\n• Candela\r\n• Kelvin\r\n• Kilogram\r\n• Meter\r\n• Mole\r\n• Number\r\n• Other\r\n• Radian\r\n• Second\r\n• Steradian\r\n• USDollar\r\nEvery unit of measure belongs to one or more unit groups, and if can be defined in terms of other \r\nunits acting as multipliers and divisors:\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 7\r\nWe’ll end with a concrete example, diastolic blood pressure.\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 8\r\nThe unit group for blood pressure is a collection of units that measure blood pressure. The unit \r\ngroup is related to the exponents of base units of the International System of Units:\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 9\r\nFinally, one member of the unit group for blood pressure is millimeter of mercury. The scope note \r\ngives an equation relating the unit of measure to the base units (in this case, kilogram, meter, and \r\nsecond).\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 10\r\nThe diagrams above were generated using a visualization tool. The text version of the diagrams is:\nThe New gist Model for Quantitative Data\r\nCopyright @ semanticarts.com 11\r\nFor more examples and some basic queries, visit the gitHub site gistReferenceData.\r\nIn closing, we would like to acknowledge the re-use of concepts from QUDT, namely:\r\n• every magnitude has an aspect, via the new gist property hasAspect\r\n• aspects are individuals instead of categories or subclasses of Magnitude as in gist 12\r\n• exponents are represented explicitly, enabling calculations"

Now I have comprehensive information about GIST, SKOS, and how LLMs are changing the knowledge organization landscape. Let me synthesize this into a comprehensive response that addresses all of Bilal's questions about how these technologies relate to the broader classification/taxonomy field and how LLMs are transforming things.\n\nKey points to cover:\n1. GIST ontology for quantitative data (from the document)\n2. SKOS as a practical standard\n3. How these fit in the classification/taxonomy landscape \n4. Concept maps, topic maps, knowledge graphs\n5. How LLMs are changing everything\n\nLet me structure this response to show the landscape and then the transformative impact of LLMs.Excellent, Bilal! You've identified the key practical implementations where ontological theory meets real-world systems. Let me map out how these technologies fit together and how LLMs are revolutionizing the entire landscape.\n\n## 🏗️ The Knowledge Organization Technology Stack\n\n**From Your GIST Document:** This is a perfect example of **domain-specific ontology engineering**. The GIST quantitative data model shows how to create rigorous, interoperable standards for specific domains (measurements, units, conversions). It demonstrates the **\"axiom-based constraints\"** approach - every measurement has an aspect, every aspect has applicable units, conversions follow mathematical rules tied to International System of Units.\n\n**SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System):**\nSKOS represents the practical middle ground - it's \"not a language for knowledge representation, but rather a language for knowledge organisation.\" Unlike OWL's formal logic, SKOS focuses on \"terms and how they are organised\" with \"semantically weaker\" relationships.\n\n**The Hierarchy of Formality:**\n```\nFormal Logic (OWL) → \"Strict reasoning, automated inference\"\n    ↓\nSKOS → \"Practical organization, human-interpretable\"  \n    ↓\nFolksonomy/Tags → \"Social, emergent categorization\"\n```\n\n## 🌐 How They Fit the Broader Classification Landscape\n\n**1. Concept Maps** - Visual knowledge representations showing relationships between concepts, typically human-created for learning/communication.\n\n**2. Topic Maps** - ISO standard for representing \"information about the structure of information resources\" - designed as a \"bibliographic meta-language able to represent, extend, and integrate almost all existing Knowledge Organization Systems.\"\n\n**3. Knowledge Graphs** - Machine-readable networks where \"ontologies represent the backbone of the formal semantics\" and \"serve as a formal contract between developers and users regarding the meaning of the data.\"\n\n**The Evolution Pattern:**\n- **Classical**: Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress (rigid hierarchies)\n- **Faceted**: Ranganathan's PMEST (flexible multi-dimensional)  \n- **Semantic Web**: OWL, SKOS (web-scale interoperability)\n- **Graph-based**: Knowledge graphs (relationship-centric)\n- **AI-augmented**: LLM-enhanced discovery and generation\n\n## 🤖 How LLMs Are Transforming Everything\n\n**1. Automated Classification & Taxonomy Generation**\n\nRecent research shows LLMs can automatically complete taxonomies: \"using embedding quantization and a Large Language Model pipeline\" to organize \"25,000 arXiv publications from Computational Linguistics into a novel scheme of classes\" discovering \"35 emerging research topics.\"\n\nThe TAXMAP system \"autonomously expands hierarchical taxonomies using contextual word embeddings and three generative models\" - processing \"over 40,000 digital terms\" and producing \"924 proposed terms, 757 of which were validated by experts.\"\n\n**2. AI-Powered Concept Mapping**\n\nTools like LLMapper can automatically create concept maps from text: \"reads the contents of a web page and spits out a concept map\" by using \"three separate calls\" - summarizing content, extracting concepts/relationships, and rendering as visualizations.\n\nAI concept map generators now provide \"new ways to understand complex ideas\" where \"a simple button click lets the AI create a concept map for you\" and can \"suggest more ideas or connections based on the context.\"\n\n**3. Enhanced Knowledge Graph Construction**\n\nLLMs now assist in multiple KG creation tasks: \"Entity resolution\" (linking related concepts), \"Entity and class extraction\" (building vocabularies from text), and \"Tagging of unstructured data\" (incorporating documents into structured graphs).\n\n**4. Bridging Formal and Informal Knowledge**\n\nSKOS now serves as \"the nucleus of a decentralised enterprise-wide knowledge graph\" where \"any node can be part of the taxonomical (SKOS) and ontological structure at the same time\" - and LLMs can \"produce massive input to make machine learning tasks more precise.\"\n\n## 🔄 The New Synthesis: LLM + Structured Knowledge\n\n**What's Changing:**\n\n1. **From Manual to AI-Assisted Creation**: Instead of hand-crafting ontologies, we can now seed them with LLM-generated structures and refine collaboratively.\n\n2. **From Static to Dynamic**: LLMs connected to knowledge graphs enable real-time querying: \"Show me all individuals who had financial transactions with Thomas Miller\" where \"the LLM uses ontology to understand relationships.\"\n\n3. **From Expert-Only to Democratized**: SKOS and LLM tools make knowledge organization accessible to domain experts, not just information architects.\n\n4. **From Single-Purpose to Multi-Modal**: Systems can now integrate quantitative data (GIST), conceptual relationships (SKOS), visual maps (concept maps), and natural language understanding (LLMs).\n\n## 🎯 For Your Knowledge Garden\n\n**The Sweet Spot Integration:**\n\n```\nYour Garden Architecture:\n├── GIST-style Quantitative Layer\n│   └── Measurements: time spent, impact scores, completion %\n├── SKOS-style Conceptual Layer  \n│   └── Concepts: broader/narrower relationships, preferred terms\n├── OWL-style Logical Layer\n│   └── Axioms: \"Palestine work gets priority\", \"Family connects to everything\"\n├── LLM-Enhanced Discovery Layer\n│   └── Auto-clustering, concept extraction, relationship suggestion\n└── Visual/Interactive Layer\n    └── Dynamic concept maps, faceted browsing, semantic search\n```\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Start with SKOS-style organization** - simpler than OWL, more structured than tags\n2. **Use LLM embeddings for automatic clustering** of your existing conversations  \n3. **Add GIST-style measurement ontology** for tracking progress, time, impact\n4. **Layer in AI-assisted concept mapping** for visual exploration\n5. **Build toward full knowledge graph** with formal reasoning when needed\n\n**The LLM Revolution means:**\n- Your garden can **evolve continuously** rather than requiring manual maintenance\n- **Semantic discovery** replaces keyword search\n- **Automatic relationship detection** surfaces unexpected connections\n- **Multi-modal interfaces** (text, visual, voice) for different thinking modes\n\nThe field is moving from **\"design once, use forever\"** to **\"seed intelligently, evolve continuously\"** - which aligns perfectly with your iterative, dialogue-driven approach to knowledge work.\n\nDoes this integration approach feel like it could support both your need for rigor AND your natural tendency toward creative emergence?",

This is exactly what SKOS does. Taking this approach, the \"concepts\" of a thesaurus or classification scheme are modeled as individuals in the SKOS data model, and the informal descriptions about and links between those \"concepts\" as given by the thesaurus or classification scheme are modeled as facts about those individuals, never as class or property axioms. Note that these are facts about the thesaurus or classification scheme itself, such as \"concept X has preferred label 'Y' and is part of thesaurus Z\"; these are not facts about the way the world is arranged within a particular subject domain, as might be expressed in a formal ontology. SKOS data are then expressed as RDF triples. The RDF graph below (in [TURTLE] as discussed in Section 1.7.3) expresses some facts about a thesaurus.\n\nIntegrity conditions are defined for the SKOS data model in a way that is independent of strategies for their implementation, in so far as that is possible. This is because there are several different ways in which a procedure to find inconsistencies with the SKOS data model could be implemented. Inconsistencies could be found using an OWL reasoner. Alternatively, some inconsistencies could be found by searching for specific patterns within the data, or by a hybrid strategy (e.g., drawing inferences using an RDFS or OWL reasoner, then searching for patterns in the inferred graph). The integrity conditions on the SKOS data model are fewer than might be expected, especially for those used to working within the closed world of database systems. See also the next sub-section, and the notes in sections 3-10 below. This document defines the SKOS data model as an OWL Full ontology.\n\nThis means in practice that, for a data model defined as an OWL Full ontology, some definitions can have a counter-intuitive meaning. No conclusions can be drawn from missing data, and removing something will never make the remaining data inconsistent. This is illustrated, for example, by the definition of skos:semanticRelation in Section 8 below. The property skos:semanticRelation is defined to have domain and range skos:Concept. These domain and range definitions give license to inferences. Consider the graph below. ... In this case, the graph above entails the following graph. <A> rdf:type skos:Concept . <B> rdf:type skos:Concept . Thus, we do not need to explicitly state here that <A> and <B> are instances of skos:Concept, because such statements are entailed by the definition of skos:semanticRelation. In the SKOS data model, most statements of definition are not integrity conditions, but are statements of logical dependency between different elements of the data model, which (unde\n\nBoth of these two graphs are, by themselves, consistent with the SKOS data model. Knowledge organization systems such as thesauri and classification schemes are applied in a wide range of situations, and an individual knowledge organization system can be used in many different information systems. By defining the SKOS data model as an OWL Full ontology, the Semantic Web can then be used as a medium for publishing, exchanging, sharing and linking data involving these knowledge organization systems. For this reason, for the expressiveness of OWL Full as a data modeling language, and for the possibility of using thesauri, classification schemes, etc., side-by-side with formal ontologies, OWL Full has been used to define the SKOS data model. The open world assumption is therefore a fundamental premise of the SKOS data model, and should be borne in mind when reading this document.",

SKOS, on the other hand, is not a language for knowledge representation, but rather a language for knowledge organisation. SKOS focuses on terms and how they are organised, the relationships between concepts are semantically weaker. The difference in the semantics of these relationships makes SKOS a useful alternative to OWL in applications scenarios where a rich expressive logic is unnecessary. Figure X attempts to depict where SKOS lies in terms of ontological formality (point to article on formality), it shows how SKOS fits somewhere in-between simple terms lists and strict formal ontology.\n\nSKOS is well placed to bridge the gap between the social tagging culture that has already gained popularity on the web, and the kind of rich metadata and structured knowledge provided by ontologies, that is needed to realise a Semantic Web.

SKOS is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommended standard for representing and publishings Knowledge Organisation Systems (KOS) on the Web. A KOS encapsulates a wide range of knowledge artefacts, but can generally be categorised as classifications schemes, thesauri, taxonomies and subject heading systems. KOS have classically been used in the library and informations sciences as a way of indexing large volumes of documents in order to facilitate document retrieval and navigation. The advent of SKOS now enables the construction of KOS that can be used to index documents and share terminologies on the web. SKOS has been designed in accordance with existing web technologies, the core SKOS data model is defined using vocabulary from OWL, RDFS and RDF, and can be serialised into any of the RDF syntaxes.",

It's a way of structuring data that allows users to navigate through a complex web of information with ease, making it easier to find the information they need, when they need it. So, what makes SKOS different from other ontologies? First and foremost, SKOS is simple. It's designed to be easy to implement and use, making it accessible to users who may not have a technical background. But that doesn't mean SKOS is any less powerful. In fact, it's quite the opposite. SKOS is an incredibly flexible and extensible ontology that can be used to model a wide range of knowledge organization schemes. Before we dive into the specifics of how SKOS works, let's take a step back and look at some of the key concepts that underlie this ontology.\n\nAnother important feature of SKOS is the ability to map relationships between different knowledge organization schemes. This makes it possible to connect different taxonomies and ontologies together, allowing users to access information from a variety of sources in a unified way. So, how does SKOS work in practice? Let's take a closer look. The first step in using SKOS is to create a SKOS vocabulary. This is essentially a set of terms and concepts that are organized in a specific way. To create a SKOS vocabulary, you'll need to define a set of concepts and terms that are relevant to your domain. You'll then need to organize these concepts into a hierarchical structure, with broader concepts at the top and narrower concepts at the bottom. Once you've defined your concepts and hierarchy, you can then start to associate terms with each concept. For example, you might associate the term \"apple\" with the concept of \"fruit.\"\n\nFrom organizing a sprawling corporate intranet to modeling entire domains of knowledge, SKOS offers a flexible and powerful way to organize and navigate complex information. By leveraging its simple yet powerful ontology, organizations can break down silos and unlock the full potential of their data, making it easier to find the information they need, when they need it. So, why not give SKOS a try and see what it can do for you?",

Companies today have access to huge amounts of data. But the real challenge isn’t collecting it—it's quickly finding answers to important questions. That's exactly what ontologies help you do. An ontology is a clear map of your business domain that defines core concepts, standardizes language, and organizes data clearly. As a result, your teams spend less time trying to figure out data, and more time making informed decisions. In this article, we’ll show how DataWalk leverages ontologies to enable businesses to efficiently query complex data and uncover hidden insights faster · Why do ontologies and knowledge graphs matter? Ontologies create a shared framework for your organization’s data. With clear rules and definitions, you can: Query Data More Efficiently: By unifying key concepts and relationships in your data, you can ask business-oriented\n\nIn Figure 3, you can see an example of ontology in DataWalk—the schema that underpins a knowledge graph. The icons represent different Sets, and the numbers indicate how many objects belong to each. Figure 3: Ontology in DataWalk system. DataWalk uses ontologies to let analysts easily find answers by quickly moving through connections in data. An ontology is only as good as the questions it helps answer. Before defining concepts and relationships, it helps to first identify the Analytical Questions (AQs) that drive decision-making. These questions shape the structure of the ontology, ensuring it is practical, relevant, and aligned with business needs. Analytical Questions—also known as Competency Questions (CQs)—are the specific queries your data must answer to support business decisions. For example, in fraud detection: \"Which high-value transactions in the last 30 days were conducted by individuals flagged for suspicious activity?\"\n\nSuppose you want to identify recent claims involving premium vehicles, but your data is scattered across multiple systems, each with its own definitions and formats.

Learn about ontologies and how they work here.\n\nOntologies can provide a structured way of organising and presenting the entities and relationships in a knowledge graph. An ontology can support faceted search by defining a hierarchy of concepts and properties, allowing users to explore the data by navigating through a series of filters. Standard ontologies are widely used in different domains to ensure interoperability between systems that use the same domain-specific knowledge. By using a standard ontology, systems can exchange data and knowledge more easily and accurately, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of data sharing and analysis. Some common standard ontologies are listed below: SKOS is a standard for representing knowledge organisation systems such as thesauri, taxonomies, and classification schemes. It provides a way to represent concepts and relationships in a hierarchical structure.\n\nUsage monitoring: The usage of the ontology should be monitored over time to evaluate its impact and effectiveness. This can be done using metrics such as query frequency, user feedback, and citation analysis. Community engagement: The ontology should be promoted and supported by a community of users and stakeholders who can provide feedback, use cases, and contributions. This can be done through outreach, training, and collaboration activities. Integration with other systems: The ontology should be integrated with other systems and workflows, such as databases, applications, and decision support systems. This ensures that the ontology is utilised effectively and efficiently, and that the data and knowledge are integrated and interoperable. Ontology governance is integral to enabling semantic application development in an enterprise setting. It involves establishing policies, procedures, and guidelines for ontology development, maintenance, and usage, as well as assigning roles and res\n\nOntologies are typically represented using a graph model, where the nodes represent concepts or classes, and the edges represent relationships between them. For example, in a medical ontology, the nodes might represent diseases, symptoms, and treatments, while the edges represent the relationships between them, such as \"causes,\" \"treats,\" or \"diagnoses.\" One of the main benefits of ontologies is that they provide a standardised way of representing and sharing knowledge, which can improve communication and collaboration across different organisations and systems. By using a common language and set of rules, ontologies can help avoid misunderstandings and improve the accuracy and consistency of information. Ontologies are used in many fields, including healthcare, finance, and engineering. In healthcare, ontologies are used to facilitate interoperability between different electronic health record systems and to support clinical decision-making.\n\nAn ontology is a formally defined representation of knowledge that sets out the concepts and relationships within a particular domain. It typically consists of a set of classes, properties, and relationships, which can be used to describe and organise information about entities in that domain. An ontology is typically represented using the OWL (Web Ontology Language) model, which is written in a format of RDF (Resource description framework). RDF has many written formats including XML, JSON and Turtle. On the other hand, a graph model is a way of representing relationships between entities using nodes and edges. It can be used to visualise and analyse complex networks of relationships, such as social networks, supply chains, or biological systems. While an ontology can be represented using a graph model, and a graph model can be used to represent relationships between entities in an ontology, they serve different purposes.",

They can be seen as the data schema of the graph. They serve as a formal contract between the developers of the knowledge graph and its users regarding the meaning of the data in it. A user could be another human being or a software application that wants to interpret the data in a reliable and precise way. Ontologies ensure a shared understanding of the data and its meanings. When formal semantics are used to express and interpret the data of a knowledge graph, there are a number of representation and modeling instruments: Classes. Most often an entity description contains a classification of the entity with respect to a class hierarchy. For instance, when dealing with business information there could be classes Person, Organization and Location. Persons and organizations can have a common superclass Agent.\n\nDBPedia.

To make data smart, the machines needed to be no longer bound by inflexible data schemas defined ‘a priori’. We needed data repositories that could represent the ‘real world’ and the tangled relationships that are entailed. All this needed to be done in a machine-readable way and have a formal semantics to enable automated reasoning that complemented and facilitated our own.

Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) introduce effective and efficient paths from raw data to decision by involving visualization and data mining technologies. Data mining-based DSS produces potentially interesting patterns from data. The transition from extracted patterns to knowledge is a delicate task. In this context, we propose to adapt a common visual analytics process for creating a path that enables the user (decision-maker) to automatically explore and visually extract insights by interacting with the patterns. This proposal is inspired from integrating traditional visual analytics concepts with the mental model of knowledge visualization. The idea is to combine an automatic and visual analysis of patterns to generate knowledge for the purpose of decision-making.\n\nThis revised second edition includes an additional chapter on information quality in e-government, a new case study on risk information, a new section on communication and knowledge quality, as well as an index to find key topics quickly. ...

This self-directed search and learning is crucial because they allow students to explore topics in depth, personalize their learning experience, and develop the independence and problem-solving skills necessary for both academic success and lifelong learning (Marchionini, 2006). However, as students progress into higher education, they need to invest significantly more time and effort into the search-as-learning process due to the increasing complexity and difficulty of course material. This demand may overwhelm students who struggle to dedicate extra time to learning. In response, with the advancement of large language models (LLMs), students are increasingly shi",

                "text": "Overview of my most recent experiment with AI: a tool for drawing concept maps from Wikipedia pages.\n\nLLMapper uses llm to parse text from a particular section of a web page (i.e., a named DIV) and pass that to GPT-4 in three separate calls, each of which transforms it in particular ways: The first call summarizes the article and extracts its key concepts and relationships. The second call renders those concepts and relationships as an RDF-formatted knowledge graph. The third call transforms the RDF code into DOT code that Graphviz can render as a concept map. There are a few other bells and whistles, but that’s the gist of it. Each “call” is a prompt that instructs GPT-4 to do various things, such as summarizing text, converting it to RDF, and converting it to DOT. Most of my “coding” time on this project has consisted of tweaking these prompts to get them to produce relatively reliable results. I say “relatively” because the tool still has a lot of issues.\n\nWe have only caught small glimpses of these things’ capabilities. LLMs have already forever transformed how many knowledge workers — including me — create value. That said, I have a hard time seeing how they lead to artificial general intelligence. But the main lesson I’ve learned while working with LLMapper is that rather than thinking of an LLM as some kind of omniscient superintelligence, it may be more useful to think of creating discrete ‘intelligences’ (or small agents) that collaborate with each other towards achieving a specific outcome. In this case, the three prompts require three kinds of ‘thinking’: ... These are distinct processes. By breaking them up, I can develop them independently. Like I said, I feel good about step 3, but steps 1 and 2 can clearly be better. The RDF step is particularly primitive. (I’m learning about knowledge graphs as part of this project.)\n\nStarting last year, I’ve been running experiments to see how LLMs might help with my work. The most obvious use case for information architecture is organizing information, so the first couple of experiments leaned in that direction. Here, I’ll share a third experiment that might be useful earlier in the IA process. In particular, I’m looking to aid research. When starting a project, I aim to understand the system’s content, context, and users. Some of this entails interviewing users and stakeholders, but much of it is desk research: learning about the product, its subject matter, competitors, etc. by reading web pages, PDFs, presentation decks, and videos. As a visual thinker, I often reflect on what I learn in concept maps. These visualizations serve as a shorthand to communicate models about the domain. I show maps to subject matter experts, stakeholders, and clients to align our understanding of what we’re working on.\n\nSynthesis is one thing LLMs do well. Ask ChatGPT to summarize an article, and you’ll get a useful couple of paragraphs that get to the gist of whatever you’re wanting to understand. But the output is still text. What if it could do the same but render a diagram instead? So that’s what I’ve been working on: an AI-assisted concept mapping tool. I call it LLMapper. In its current incarnation, it “reads” the contents of a web page and spits out a concept map, like this: This is a concept map of the Wikipedia page of the first Star Wars movie. To get this result, all I needed to do was go to my Mac’s command line and pass the URL for this web page to the correct Wikipedia page, like this: ./llmapper https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_\\(film\\) Currently, the tool has several limitations. For one thing, it’s hardwired to only read Wikipedia pages.",

KGs use semantics to connect datasets via their meaning i.e. the entities they are representing. LLMs use vectors and deep neural networks to predict natural language.\n\nNLP has been used for decades for entity extraction for example, LLM is just a new capability to assist the ontologist/taxonomist. Some of the ways LLMs can help in the KG creation process are: Entity resolution: Entity resolution is the process of aligning records that refer to the same real-world entity. For example, acetaminophen, a common pain reliever used in the US and sold under the brand name Tylenol, is called paracetamol in the UK and sold under the brand name Panadol. These four names are nothing alike, but If you were to embed your KG into a vector database, the vectors would have the semantic understanding to know that these entities are closely related. Tagging of unstructured data: Suppose you want to incorporate some unstructured data into your KG. You have a bunch of PDFs with vague file names but you know there is important information in those documents. You need to tag these documents with file type and topic.\n\nIf your topical taxonomy and document type taxonomy have been embedded, all you need to do is vectorize the documents and the vector database will identify the most relevant entities from each taxonomy. Entity and class extraction: Create or enhance a controlled vocabulary like an ontology or a taxonomy based on a corpus of unstructured data. Entity extraction is similar to tagging but the goal here is about enhancing the ontology rather than incorporating unstructured data into KG. Suppose you have a geographic ontology and you want to populate it with instances of towns, cities, states, etc. You can use an LLM to extract entities from a corpus of text to populate the ontology. Likewise, you can use the LLM to extract classes and relationships between classes from the corpus. Suppose you forgot to include ‘capital’ in your ontology. The LLM might be able to extract this as a new class or a property of a city.\n\nI bring up my cover letter because 1) I think it is a great example of the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, and why KGs are an important part of their implementation and 2) this use case is not that different from what many large enterprises are using LLMs for currently: automated report generation. ChatGPT does a pretty good job of recreating a cover letter by changing the content to be more focused on a specific job description, as long as you explicitly include the existing cover letter and job description in the prompt. Ensuring the LLM has the right content is where a KG comes in. If you simply write, ‘write me a cover letter for a job I want,’ the results are going to be laughable. Additionally, the cover letter example is a great application of an LLM because it is about summarizing and restructuring language. Remember what the second L in LLM stands for?\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are different ways of providing more people access to data. KGs use semantics to connect datasets via their meaning i.e. the entities they are representing. LLMs use vectors and deep neural networks to predict natural language. They are often both aimed at ‘unlocking’ data. For enterprises implementing KGs, the end goal is usually something like a data marketplace, a semantic layer, to FAIR-ify their data or to make their enterprise more data-centric. These are all different solutions with the same end goal: making more data available to the right people faster. For enterprises implementing an LLM or some other similar GenAI solution, the goal is often similar: to provide employees or customers with a ‘digital assistant’ that can get the right information to the right people faster. The potential symbiosis is clear: some of the main weaknesses of LLMs, that they are black-box models and struggle with factual knowledge, are some of",

It considers questions such as the validity of knowledge representations and their effectiveness for the purposes of retrieval and automation. The knowledge representations it considers are derived from three theories of meaning that have dominated twentieth-century philosophy. The discipline of philosophy impacts other knowledge disciplines, particularly in the theoretical constructs they employ. The purpose of this paper is to explore how epistemology, that branch of philosophy concerned with how and what we know, has contributed to the design of knowledge representations embodied in retrieval languages designed for organizing information. Different retrieval languages make different presuppositions about what is meant by knowledge. These differences give rise to questions such as How valid are the knowledge representations embodied in different retrieval languages, i.e.,\n\nEstrada, 2011).

There are two most important trends observed in research on knowledge organization (KO) and in the development of knowledge organization systems (KOS) used in practice, i.e.\n\nThis article comprises a literature review and conceptual analysis of Topic Maps-the ISO standard for representing information about the structure of information resources-according to the principles of Knowledge Organization (KO). Using the main principles from this discipline, the study shows how Topic Maps is proposed as an ontology model independent of technology. Topic Maps constitutes a 'bibliographic' meta-language able to represent, extend, and integrate almost all existing Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) in a standards-based generic model applicable to digital content and to the Web. This report also presents an inventory of the current applications of Topic Maps in Libraries, Archives, and Museums (LAM), as well as in the Digital Humanities. Finally, some directions for further research are suggested, which relate Topic Maps to the main research trends in KO.\n\nEstrada and Melgar (2011) propose the standard general model adapted to the digital content and network through analysing the concept of topic map. Peng et al. (2005) studies the method of selecting excellent features based on the maximum statistical dependency criterion of mutual information, and proposes a two-stage feature selection algorithm, which can significantly improve the accuracy of feature selection and classification. ... Research on product design knowledge organisation model based on granularity principle ...

These are organized within 7 parent classes and 20 subclasses in the field of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). This approach may serve as a baseline for automatically generating hierarchical candidate schemes in high-level arXiv categories and efficiently completing taxonomies, addressing the challenge posed by the increasing volume of academic literature. Taxonomy Completion of Academic Literature with Embedding Quantization and an LLM-Pipeline · Embeddings are numerical representations of real-world objects like text, images, and audio that encapsulate semantic information of the data they represent. They are used by AI models to understand complex knowledge domains in downstream applications such as clustering, information retrieval, and semantic understanding tasks, among others.\n\nThe ever-growing volume of research publications necessitates efficient methods for structuring academic knowledge. This task typically involves developing a supervised underlying scheme of classes and allocating publications to the most relevant class. In this article, we implement an end-to-end automated solution using embedding quantization and a Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline. Our case study starts with a dataset of 25,000 arXiv publications from Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), published before July 2024, which we organize under a novel scheme of classes. Our approach centers on three key tasks: (i) unsupervised clustering of the arXiv dataset into related collections, (ii) discovering the latent thematic structures within each cluster, and (iii) creating a candidate taxonomy scheme based on said thematic structures. At its core, the clustering task requires identifying a sufficient number of similar examples within an unlabeled dataset.\n\nHaving performed the clustering step, we now illustrate how to infer the latent topic of each cluster by combining an LLM such as Mistral-7B-Instruct [5] with Pydantic and LangChain to create an LLM pipeline that generates output in a composable structured format. Pydantic Models are classes that derive from pydantic.BaseModel, defining fields as type-annotated attributes. They are similar to Python dataclasses. However, they have been designed with subtle but significant differences that optimize various operations such as validation, serialization, and JSON schema generation. Our Topic class defines a field named label. This will generate LLM output in a structured format, rather than a free-form text block, facilitating easier processing and analysis. from pydantic import BaseModel, Field class Topic(BaseModel): \"\"\" Pydantic Model to generate an structured Topic Model \"\"\" label: str = Field(..., description=\"Identified topic\") LangChain Prompt Templates are pre-defined recipes for t\n\nThe entire hierarchical scheme is available at cs.CL.taxonomy.

However, maintaining their accuracy requires continuous updates, often demanding expert input. To address this, we propose TAXMAP (TAxonomy eXpansion through Collaborative LLM MAPping), a system that autonomously expands hierarchical taxonomies using contextual word embeddings and three generative models, with a human validation step ensuring relevance. Implemented within an EU initiative to enhance the European Skill taxonomy (ESCO), our framework processed over 40,000 digital terms gathered from the Web, aligning ESCO skills with labor market needs. This effort resulted in 924 proposed terms, 757 of which were validated by experts as correct. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) as encoders, TAXMAP reduces errors, ensures high precision, and minimizes human effort.\n\nTaxonomies represent an arborescence hierarchical structure that establishes relationships among entities to convey knowledge within a specific domain.

Let me map out how these technologies fit together and how LLMs are revolutionizing the entire landscape.\n\n## 🏗️ The Knowledge Organization Technology Stack\n\n**From Your GIST Document:** This is a perfect example of **domain-specific ontology engineering**. The GIST quantitative data model shows how to create rigorous, interoperable standards for specific domains (measurements, units, conversions). It demonstrates the **\"axiom-based constraints\"** approach - every measurement has an aspect, every aspect has applicable units, conversions follow mathematical rules tied to International System of Units.\n\n**SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System):**\nSKOS represents the practical middle ground - it's \"not a language for knowledge representation, but rather a language for knowledge organisation.\" Unlike OWL's formal logic, SKOS focuses on \"terms and how they are organised\" with \"semantically weaker\" relationships.\n\n**The Hierarchy of Formality:**\n```\nFormal Logic (OWL) → \"Strict reasoning, automated inference\"\n    ↓\nSKOS → \"Practical organization, human-interpretable\"  \n    ↓\nFolksonomy/Tags → \"Social, emergent categorization\"\n```\n\n## 🌐 How They Fit the Broader Classification Landscape\n\n**1. Concept Maps** - Visual knowledge representations showing relationships between concepts, typically human-created for learning/communication.\n\n**2. Topic Maps** - ISO standard for representing \"information about the structure of information resources\" - designed as a \"bibliographic meta-language able to represent, extend, and integrate almost all existing Knowledge Organization Systems.\"\n\n**3. Knowledge Graphs** - Machine-readable networks where \"ontologies represent the backbone of the formal semantics\" and \"serve as a formal contract between developers and users regarding the meaning of the data.\"\n\n**The Evolution Pattern:**\n- **Classical**: Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress (rigid hierarchies)\n- **Faceted**: Ranganathan's PMEST (flexible multi-dimensional)  \n- **Semantic Web**: OWL, SKOS (web-scale interoperability)\n- **Graph-based**: Knowledge graphs (relationship-centric)\n- **AI-augmented**: LLM-enhanced discovery and generation\n\n## 🤖 How LLMs Are Transforming Everything\n\n**1. Automated Classification & Taxonomy Generation**\n\nRecent research shows LLMs can automatically complete taxonomies: \"using embedding quantization and a Large Language Model pipeline\" to organize \"25,000 arXiv publications from Computational Linguistics into a novel scheme of classes\" discovering \"35 emerging research topics.\"\n\nThe TAXMAP system \"autonomously expands hierarchical taxonomies using contextual word embeddings and three generative models\" - processing \"over 40,000 digital terms\" and producing \"924 proposed terms, 757 of which were validated by experts.\"\n\n**2. AI-Powered Concept Mapping**\n\nTools like LLMapper can automatically create concept maps from text: \"reads the contents of a web page and spits out a concept map\" by using \"three separate calls\" - summarizing content, extracting concepts/relationships, and rendering as visualizations.\n\nAI concept map generators now provide \"new ways to understand complex ideas\" where \"a simple button click lets the AI create a concept map for you\" and can \"suggest more ideas or connections based on the context.\"\n\n**3. Enhanced Knowledge Graph Construction**\n\nLLMs now assist in multiple KG creation tasks: \"Entity resolution\" (linking related concepts), \"Entity and class extraction\" (building vocabularies from text), and \"Tagging of unstructured data\" (incorporating documents into structured graphs).\n\n**4. Bridging Formal and Informal Knowledge**\n\nSKOS now serves as \"the nucleus of a decentralised enterprise-wide knowledge graph\" where \"any node can be part of the taxonomical (SKOS) and ontological structure at the same time\" - and LLMs can \"produce massive input to make machine learning tasks more precise.\"\n\n## 🔄 The New Synthesis: LLM + Structured Knowledge\n\n**What's Changing:**\n\n1. **From Manual to AI-Assisted Creation**: Instead of hand-crafting ontologies, we can now seed them with LLM-generated structures and refine collaboratively.\n\n2. **From Static to Dynamic**: LLMs connected to knowledge graphs enable real-time querying: \"Show me all individuals who had financial transactions with Thomas Miller\" where \"the LLM uses ontology to understand relationships.\"\n\n3. **From Expert-Only to Democratized**: SKOS and LLM tools make knowledge organization accessible to domain experts, not just information architects.\n\n4. **From Single-Purpose to Multi-Modal**: Systems can now integrate quantitative data (GIST), conceptual relationships (SKOS), visual maps (concept maps), and natural language understanding (LLMs).\n\n## 🎯 For Your Knowledge Garden\n\n**The Sweet Spot Integration:**\n\n```\nYour Garden Architecture:\n├── GIST-style Quantitative Layer\n│   └── Measurements: time spent, impact scores, completion %\n├── SKOS-style Conceptual Layer  \n│   └── Concepts: broader/narrower relationships, preferred terms\n├── OWL-style Logical Layer\n│   └── Axioms: \"Palestine work gets priority\", \"Family connects to everything\"\n├── LLM-Enhanced Discovery Layer\n│   └── Auto-clustering, concept extraction, relationship suggestion\n└── Visual/Interactive Layer\n    └── Dynamic concept maps, faceted browsing, semantic search\n```\n\n**Practical Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Start with SKOS-style organization** - simpler than OWL, more structured than tags\n2. **Use LLM embeddings for automatic clustering** of your existing conversations  \n3. **Add GIST-style measurement ontology** for tracking progress, time, impact\n4. **Layer in AI-assisted concept mapping** for visual exploration\n5. **Build toward full knowledge graph** with formal reasoning when needed\n\n**The LLM Revolution means:**\n- Your garden can **evolve continuously** rather than requiring manual maintenance\n- **Semantic discovery** replaces keyword search\n- **Automatic relationship detection** surfaces unexpected connections\n- **Multi-modal interfaces** (text, visual, voice) for different thinking modes\n\nThe field is moving from **\"design once, use forever\"** to **\"seed intelligently, evolve continuously\"** - which aligns perfectly with your iterative, dialogue-driven approach to knowledge work.\n\nDoes this integration approach feel like it could support both your need for rigor AND your natural tendency toward creative emergence?",

Bilal wants me to use our actual conversation as a case study and apply three different approaches (complex to simpler) to digest it and develop knowledge organization elements that balance rigor and emergence. This is exactly what we've been discussing theoretically - now we get to apply it practically.\n\nLet me think about three approaches:\n\n1. **Complex**: Full knowledge graph approach with OWL-style axioms, GIST-style measurements, formal ontology structure\n2. **Medium**: SKOS-style concept organization with LLM-enhanced clustering and relationships\n3. **Simple**: Basic faceted classification with emergent tags and lightweight structure\n\nI should analyze our actual conversation content and extract:\n- Key concepts\n- Relationships\n- Tensions\n- Questions\n- Resources\n- Insights\n- Actions\n\nOur conversation has covered:\n- LLM embeddings for knowledge clustering\n- Classical library science (DDC, LCC, UDC)\n- Ranganathan's PMEST framework\n- Faceted classification\n- 5 W's + H framework\n- OWL ontology structure\n- Key researchers (Gruber, Smith, Guarino, Ranganathan, Vervaeke)\n- GIST quantitative modeling\n- SKOS practical organization\n- Knowledge graphs\n- Concept maps\n- AI-enhanced classification\n- Bilal's personal tensions around rigor vs usefulness\n- His knowledge garden vision\n- Values integration (Palestine, family, spirituality)\n\nI should show how each approach would handle this same content differently, demonstrating the trade-offs between formality/rigor and emergence/flexibility.Brilliant idea, Bilal! Let's use our actual conversation as a live laboratory. I'll show three approaches to digest and organize the knowledge we've generated, each balancing rigor and emergence differently.\n\n## 🗂️ **APPROACH 1: Complex Knowledge Graph (Maximum Rigor)**\n\n###

experimentation\n**Weaknesses:** Less precise, harder to query systematically, potential tag chaos\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **Synthesis: Which Approach for Bilal?**\n\nBased on our conversation, I'd recommend **starting with Approach 3 (Simple)** for immediate capture, while **building toward Approach 2 (SKOS-style)** for systematic organization. Here's why:\n\n**Phase 1: Start Simple (Months 1-3)**\n- Use faceted tags for immediate capture during conversations\n- Weekly garden reviews using the template\n- Voice-note tagging with \"Seed,\" \"Tension,\" \"Insight\"\n\n**Phase 2: Add Structure (Months 4-6)** \n- Migrate to SKOS-style concept organization\n- Use LLM embedding clustering to discover patterns\n- Add semantic relationships between concepts\n\n**Phase 3: Formalize (Months 6+)**\n- Introduce logical axioms for core values (Palestine priority, family integration)\n- Add quantitative measurements (time investment, impact tracking)\n- Build toward queryable knowledge graph\n\n**The key insight:** Your garden needs to **honor your natural rhythms** (voice-heavy, dialogue-driven, iterative) while **gradually increasing rigor** without killing emergence.\n\nWhich approach feels most aligned with how you actually want to work?This is a comprehensive answer that demonstrates three different approaches to organizing our actual conversation. I've shown:\n\n1. **Complex approach**: Full OWL/GIST formal ontology with axioms, measurements, and semantic reasoning\n2. **Medium approach**: SKOS-style balanced approach with hierarchical concepts and LLM enhancement\n3. **Simple approach**: Basic faceted classification with emergent tags and templates\n\nEach approach handles the same content (our conversation) but with different levels of formality, maintenance requirements, and capabilities. I've tried to show:\n\n- How the content would be represented in each system\n- The trade-offs in terms of rigor vs. emergence\n- Practical implementation considerations\n- A phased approach that starts simple and builds complexity\n\nThe key insight is that Bilal's garden needs to match his natural working style (dialogue-driven, iterative, voice-heavy) while gradually building more structure. Starting with the simple approach allows immediate capture and use, while the roadmap toward more formal approaches gives a growth path.\n\nI've used actual content from our conversation as examples, showing how his core tensions (rigor vs. emergence, isolation vs. dialogue), the frameworks we discussed (PMEST, SKOS, LLM embeddings), and his personal context (Palestine mission, family values, France location) would be represented in each system.\n\nThis demonstrates the practical application of all the theoretical frameworks we've discussed, making it a real case study rather than just abstract discussion.",

**starting with Approach 3 (Simple)** for immediate capture, while **building toward Approach 2 (SKOS-style)** for systematic organization.

Another notation that is often used in the literature to represent a triple (or fact) is \n<\nh\ne\na\nd\n,\nr\ne\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n,\nt\na\ni\nl\n>\n{\\displaystyle <head,relation,tail>}. This notation is called resource description framework (RDF).[1][5] A knowledge graph represents the knowledge related to a specific domain; leveraging this structured representation, it is possible to infer a piece of new knowledge from it after some refinement steps.[6] However, nowadays, people have to deal with the sparsity of data and the computational inefficiency to use them in a real-world application.[3][7]\n\nThe embedding of a knowledge graph is a function that translates each entity and each relation into a vector of a given dimension \nd\n{\\displaystyle d}, called embedding dimension.[7] It is even possible to embed the entities and relations with different dimensions.[7] The embedding vectors can then be used for other tasks.\n\nA knowledge graph embedding is characterized by four aspects:[1]\n\nRepresentation space: The low-dimensional space in which the entities and relations are represented.[1]\nScoring function: A measure of the goodness of a triple embedded representation.[1]\nEncoding models: The modality in which the embedded representation of the entities and relations interact with each other.[1]\nAdditional information: Any additional information coming from the knowledge graph that can enrich the embedded representation.[1] Usually, an ad hoc scoring function is integrated into the general scoring function for each additional information.[5][1][8]\nEmbedding procedure\nAll algorithms for creating a knowledge graph embedding follow the same approach.[7] First, the embedding vectors are initialized to random values.[7] Then, they are iteratively optimized using a training set of triples. In each iteration, a batch of size \nb\n{\\displaystyle b} triples is sampled from the training set, and a triple from it is sampled and corrupted—i.e., a triple that does not represent a true fact in the knowledge graph.[7] The corruption of a triple involves substituting the head or the tail (or both) of the triple with another entity that makes the fact false.[7] The original triple and the corrupted triple are added in the training batch, and then the embeddings are updated, optimizing a scoring function.[5][7] Iteration stops when a stop condition is reached.[7] Usually, the stop condition depends on the overfitting of the training set.[7] At the end, the learned embeddings should have extracted semantic meaning from the training triples and should correctly predict unseen true facts in the knowledge graph.[5]\n\nPseudocode\nThe following is the pseudocode for the general embedding procedure.[9][7]\n\nalgorithm Compute entity and relation embeddings\n    input: The training set \nS\n=\n{\n(\nh\n,\nr\n,\nt\n)\n}\n{\\displaystyle S=\\{(h,r,t)\\}}, \n           entity set \nE\n{\\displaystyle E}, \n           relation set \nR\n{\\displaystyle R},     \n           embedding dimension \nk\n{\\displaystyle k}\n    output: Entity and relation embeddings\n\n    initialization: the entities \ne\n{\\displaystyle e} and relations \nr\n{\\displaystyle r} embeddings (vectors) are randomly initialized\n\n    while stop condition do\n        \nS\nb\na\nt\nc\nh\n←\ns\na\nm\np\nl\ne\n(\nS\n,\nb\n)\n{\\displaystyle S_{batch}\\leftarrow sample(S,b)}  // Sample a batch from the training set\n        for each \n(\nh\n,\nr\n,\nt\n)\n{\\displaystyle (h,r,t)} in \nS\nb\na\nt\nc\nh\n{\\displaystyle S_{batch}} do\n            \n(\nh\n′\n,\nr\n,\nt\n′\n)\n←\ns\na\nm\np\nl\ne\n(\nS\n′\n)\n{\\displaystyle (h',r,t')\\leftarrow sample(S')}  // Sample a corrupted fact \n            \nT\nb\na\nt\nc\nh\n←\nT\nb\na\nt\nc\nh\n∪\n{\n(\n(\nh\n,\nr\n,\nt\n)\n,\n(\nh\n′\n,\nr\n,\nt\n′\n)\n)\n}\n{\\displaystyle T_{batch}\\leftarrow T_{batch}\\cup \\{((h,r,t),(h',r,t'))\\}} \n        end for\n        Update embeddings by minimizing the loss function\n    end while\nPerformance indicators\nThese indexes are often used to measure the embedding quality of a model. The simplicity of the indexes makes them very suitable for evaluating the performance of an embedding algorithm even on a large scale.[10] Given \nQ\n{\\displaystyle {\\ce {Q}}} as the set of all ranked predictions of a model, it is possible to define three different performance indexes: Hits@K, MR, and MRR.[10]\n\nHits@K\nHits@K or in short, H@K, is a performance index that measures the probability to find the correct prediction in the first top K model predictions.[10] Usually, it is used \nk\n=\n10\n{\\displaystyle k=10}.[10] Hits@K reflects the accuracy of an embedding model to predict the relation between two given triples correctly.[10]\n\nHits@K\n=\n|\n{\nq\n∈\nQ\n:\nq\n<\nk\n}\n|\n|\nQ\n|\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n{\\displaystyle ={\\frac {|\\{q\\in Q:q<k\\}|}{|Q|}}\\in [0,1]}\n\nLarger values mean better predictive performances.[10]\n\nMean rank (MR)\nMean rank is the average ranking position of the items predicted by the model among all the possible items.[10]\n\nM\nR\n=\n1\n|\nQ\n|\n∑\nq\n∈\nQ\nq\n{\\displaystyle MR={\\frac {1}{|Q|}}\\sum _{q\\in Q}{q}}\n\nThe smaller the value, the better the model.[10]\n\nMean reciprocal rank (MRR)\nMean reciprocal rank measures the number of triples predicted correctly.[10] If the first predicted triple is correct, then 1 is added, if the second is correct \n1\n2\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{2}}} is summed, and so on.[10]\n\nMean reciprocal rank is generally used to quantify the effect of search algorithms.[10]\n\nM\nR\nR\n=\n1\n|\nQ\n|\n∑\nq\n∈\nQ\n1\nq\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n{\\displaystyle MRR={\\frac {1}{|Q|}}\\sum _{q\\in Q}{\\frac {1}{q}}\\in [0,1]}\n\nThe larger the index, the better the model.[10]\n\nApplications\nMachine learning tasks\nKnowledge graph completion (KGC) is a collection of techniques to infer knowledge from an embedded knowledge graph representation.[11] In particular, this technique completes a triple inferring the missing entity or relation.[11] The corresponding sub-tasks are named link or entity prediction (i.e., guessing an entity from the embedding given the other entity of the triple and the relation), and relation prediction (i.e., forecasting the most plausible relation that connects two entities).[11]\n\nTriple Classification is a binary classification problem.[1] Given a triple, the trained model evaluates the plausibility of the triple using the embedding to determine if a triple is true or false.[11] The decision is made with the model score function and a given threshold.[11] Clustering is another application that leverages the embedded representation of a sparse knowledge graph to condense the representation of similar semantic entities close in a 2D space.[4]\n\nReal world applications\nThe use of knowledge graph embedding is increasingly pervasive in many applications. In the case of recommender systems, the use of knowledge graph embedding can overcome the limitations of the usual reinforcement learning,[12][13] as well as limitations of the conventional collaborative filtering method.[14] Training this kind of recommender system requires a huge amount of information from the users; however, knowledge graph techniques can address this issue by using a graph already constructed over a prior knowledge of the item correlation and using the embedding to infer from it the recommendation.[12] Drug repurposing is the use of an already approved drug, but for a therapeutic purpose different from the one for which it was initially designed.[15] It is possible to use the task of link prediction to infer a new connection between an already existing drug and a disease by using a biomedical knowledge graph built leveraging the availability of massive literature and biomedical databases.[15] Knowledge graph embedding can also be used in the domain of social politics.[4]\n\nModels\n\nPublication timeline of some knowledge graph embedding models. In red the tensor decomposition models, in blue the geometric models, and in green the deep learning models. RESCAL[16] (2011) was the first modern KGE approach. In[17] it was applied to the YAGO knowledge graph. This was the first application of KGE to a large scale knowledge graph.\nGiven a collection of triples (or facts) \nF\n=\n{\n<\nh\ne\na\nd\n,\nr\ne\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n,\nt\na\ni\nl\n>\n}\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {F}}=\\{<head,relation,tail>\\}}, the knowledge graph embedding model produces, for each entity and relation present in the knowledge graph a continuous vector representation.[7] \n(\nh\n,\nr\n,\nt\n)\n{\\displaystyle (h,r,t)} is the corresponding embedding of a triple with \nh\n,\nt\n∈\nI\nR\nd\n{\\displaystyle h,t\\in {\\rm {I\\!R}}^{d}} and \nr\n∈\nI\nR\nk\n{\\displaystyle r\\in {\\rm {I\\!R}}^{k}} , where \nd\n{\\displaystyle d} is the embedding dimension for the entities, and \nk\n{\\displaystyle k} for the relations.[7] The score function of a given model is denoted by \nf\nr\n(\nh\n,\nt\n)\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {f}}_{r}(h,t)} and measures the distance of the embedding of the head from the embedding of tail given the embedding of the relation. In other words, it quantifies the plausibility of the embedded representation of a given fact.[5]\n\nRossi et al. propose a taxonomy of the embedding models and identifies three main families of models: tensor decomposition models, geometric models, and deep learning models.[5]\n\nTensor decomposition model\nThe tensor decomposition is a family of knowledge graph embedding models that use a multi-dimensional matrix to represent a knowledge graph,[1][5][18] that is partially knowable due to gaps of the graph describing a particular domain thoroughly.[5] In particular, these models use a third-order (3D) tensor, which is then factorized into low-dimensional vectors that are the embeddings.[5][18] A third-order tensor is suitable for representing a knowledge graph because it records only the existence or absence of a relation between entities,[18] and so is simple, and there is no need to know a priori the network structure,[16] making this class of embedding models light, and easy to train even if they suffer from high-dimensionality and sparsity of data.[5][18]\n\nBilinear models\nThis family of models uses a linear equation to embed the connection between the entities through a relation.[1] In particular, the embedded representation of the relations is a bidimensional matrix.[5] These models, during the embedding procedure, only use the single facts to compute the embedded representation and ignore the other associations to the same entity or relation.[19]\n\nDistMult[20]: Since the embedding matrix of the relation is a diagonal matrix,[5] the scoring function can not distinguish asymmetric facts.[5][19]\nComplEx[21]: As DistMult uses a diagonal matrix to represent the relations embedding but adds a representation in the complex vector space and the hermitian product, it can distinguish symmetric and asymmetric facts.[5][18] This approach is scalable to a large knowledge graph in terms of time and space cost.[21]\nANALOGY[22]: This model encodes in the embedding the analogical structure of the knowledge graph to simulate inductive reasoning.[22][5][1] Using a differentiable objective function, ANALOGY has good theoretical generality and computational scalability.[22] It is proven that the embedding produced by ANALOGY fully recovers the embedding of DistMult, ComplEx, and HolE.[22]\nSimplE[23]: This model is the improvement of canonical polyadic decomposition (CP), in which an embedding vector for the relation and two independent embedding vectors for each entity are learned, depending on whether it is a head or a tail in the knowledge graph fact.[23] SimplE resolves the problem of independent learning of the two entity embeddings using an inverse relation and average the CP score of \n(\nh\n,\nr\n,\nt\n)\n{\\displaystyle (h,r,t)} and \n(\nt\n,\nr\n−\n1\n,\nh\n)\n{\\displaystyle (t,r^{-1},h)}.[7][18] In this way, SimplE collects the relation between entities while they appear in the role of subject or object inside a fact, and it is able to embed asymmetric relations.[5]\nNon-bilinear models\nHolE:[24] HolE uses circular correlation to create an embedded representation of the knowledge graph,[24] which can be seen as a compression of the matrix product, but is more computationally efficient and scalable while keeping the capabilities to express asymmetric relation since the circular correlation is not commutative.[19] HolE links holographic and complex embeddings since, if used together with Fourier, can be seen as a special case of ComplEx.[1]\nTuckER:[25] TuckER sees the knowledge graph as a tensor that could be decomposed using the Tucker decomposition in a collection of vectors—i.e., the embeddings of entities and relations—with a shared core.[25][5] The weights of the core tensor are learned together with the embeddings and represent the level of interaction of the entries.[26] Each entity and relation has its own embedding dimension, and the size of the core tensor is determined by the shape of the entities and relations that interact.[5] The embedding of the subject and object of a fact are summed in the same way, making TuckER fully expressive, and other embedding models such as RESCAL, DistMult, ComplEx, and SimplE can be expressed as a special formulation of TuckER.[25]\nMEI:[27] MEI introduces the multi-partition embedding interaction technique with the block term tensor format, which is a generalization of CP decomposition and Tucker decomposition. It divides the embedding vector into multiple partitions and learns the local interaction patterns from data instead of using fixed special patterns as in ComplEx or SimplE models. This enables MEI to achieve optimal efficiency—expressiveness trade-off, not just being fully expressive.[27] Previous models such as TuckER, RESCAL, DistMult, ComplEx, and SimplE are suboptimal restricted special cases of MEI.\nMEIM:[28] MEIM goes beyond the block term tensor format to introduce the independent core tensor for ensemble boosting effects and the soft orthogonality for max-rank relational mapping, in addition to multi-partition embedding interaction. MEIM generalizes several previous models such as MEI and its subsumed models, RotaE, and QuatE.[28] MEIM improves expressiveness while still being highly efficient in practice, helping it achieve good results using fairly small model sizes.\nGeometric models\nThe geometric space defined by this family of models encodes the relation as a geometric transformation between the head and tail of a fact.[5] For this reason, to compute the embedding of the tail, it is necessary to apply a transformation \nτ\n{\\displaystyle \\tau } to the head embedding, and a distance function \nδ\n{\\displaystyle \\delta } is used to measure the goodness of the embedding or to score the reliability of a fact.[5]\n\nf\nr\n(\nh\n,\nt\n)\n=\nδ\n(\nτ\n(\nh\n,\nr\n)\n,\nt\n)\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {f}}_{r}(h,t)=\\delta (\\tau (h,r),t)}\n\nGeometric models are similar to the tensor decomposition model, but the main difference between the two is that they have to preserve the applicability of the transformation \nτ\n{\\displaystyle \\tau } in the geometric space in which it is defined.[5]\n\nPure translational models\nThis class of models is inspired by the idea of translation invariance introduced in word2vec.[7] A pure translational model relies on the fact that the embedding vector of the entities are close to each other after applying a proper relational translation in the geometric space in which they are defined.[19] In other words, given a fact, the embedding of the head plus the embedding of the relation should equal the embedding of the tail.[5] The closeness of the entities embedding is given by some distance measure and quantifies the reliability of a fact.[18]\n\n\nTransE embedding model. The vector representation (embedding) of the head plus the vector representation of the relation should be equal to the vector representation of the tail entity.\nTransE[9]: Uses a scoring function that forces the embeddings to satisfy a simple vector sum equation in each fact in which they appear: \nh\n+\nr\n=\nt\n{\\displaystyle h+r=t}.[7] The embedding will be exact if each entity and relation appears in only one fact, and so in practice is poor at representing one-to-many, many-to-one, and asymmetric relations.[5][7]\nTransH[29]: A modification of TransE for representing types of relations, by using a hyperplane as a geometric space.[29] In TransH, the relation embedding is on a different hyperplane depending on the entities it interacts with.[7] So, to compute, for example, the score function of a fact, the embedded representation of the head and tail need to be projected using a relational projection matrix on the correct hyperplane of the relation.[1][7]\nTransR[30]: A modification of TransH that uses different spaces embedding entities versus relations,[1][19] thus separating the semantic spaces of entities and relations.[7] TransR also uses a relational projection matrix to translate the embedding of the entities to the relation space.[7]\nTransD:[31] In TransR, the head and the tail of a given fact could belong to two different types of entities. For example, in the fact\n(\nO\nb\na\nm\na\n,\np\nr\ne\ns\ni\nd\ne\nn\nt\n_\no\nf\n,\nU\nS\nA\n)\n{\\displaystyle (Obama,president\\_of,USA)}, Obama is a person and USA is a country.[31][7] Matrix multiplication is an expensive procedure in TransR to compute the projection.[7][31] In this context, TransD uses two vectors for each entity-relation pair to compute a dynamic mapping that substitutes the projection matrix while reducing the dimensional complexity.[1][7][31] The first vector is used to represent the semantic meaning of the entities and relations, the second to compute the mapping matrix.[31]\nTransA:[32] All the translational models define a score function in their representation space, but they oversimplify this metric loss.[32] Since the vector representation of the entities and relations is not perfect, a pure translation of \nh\n+\nr\n{\\displaystyle h+r} could be distant from \nt\n{\\displaystyle t}, and a spherical equipotential Euclidean distance makes it hard to distinguish which is the closest entity.[32] TransA, instead, introduces an adaptive Mahalanobis distance to weights the embedding dimensions, together with elliptical surfaces to remove the ambiguity.[1][7][32]\nTranslational models with additional embeddings\nIt is possible to associate additional information to each element in the knowledge graph and their common representation facts.[1] Each entity and relation can be enriched with text descriptions, weights, constraints, and others in order to improve the overall description of the domain with a knowledge graph.[1] During the embedding of the knowledge graph, this information can be used to learn specialized embeddings for these characteristics together with the usual embedded representation of entities and relations, with the cost of learning a more significant number of vectors.[5]\n\nSTransE:[33] This model is the result of the combination of TransE and of the structure embedding[33] in such a way it is able to better represent the one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations.[5] To do so, the model involves two additional independent matrix \nW\nr\nh\n{\\displaystyle W_{r}^{h}} and \nW\nr\nt\n{\\displaystyle W_{r}^{t}} for each embedded relation \nr\n{\\displaystyle r} in the KG.[33] Each additional matrix is used based on the fact the specific relation interact with the head or the tail of the fact.[33] In other words, given a fact \n(\nh\n,\nr\n,\nt\n)\n{\\displaystyle (h,r,t)}, before applying the vector translation, the head \nh\n{\\displaystyle h} is multiplied by \nW\nr\nh\n{\\displaystyle W_{r}^{h}} and the tail is multiplied by \nW\nr\nt\n{\\displaystyle W_{r}^{t}}.[7]\nCrossE:[34] Crossover interactions can be used for related information selection, and could be very useful for the embedding procedure.[34] Crossover interactions provide two distinct contributions in the information selection: interactions from relations to entities and interactions from entities to relations.[34] This means that a relation, e.g.'president_of' automatically selects the types of entities that are connecting the subject to the object of a fact.[34] In a similar way, the entity of a fact inderectly determine which is inference path that has to be choose to predict the object of a related triple.[34] CrossE, to do so, learns an additional interaction matrix \nC\n{\\displaystyle C}, uses the element-wise product to compute the interaction between \nh\n{\\displaystyle h} and \nr\n{\\displaystyle r}.[5][34] Even if, CrossE, does not rely on a neural network architecture, it is shown that this methodology can be encoded in such architecture.[1]\nRoto-translational models\nThis family of models, in addition or in substitution of a translation they employ a rotation-like transformation.[5]\n\nTorusE:[35] The regularization term of TransE makes the entity embedding to build a spheric space, and consequently loses the translation properties of the geometric space.[35] To address this problem, TorusE leverages the use of a compact Lie group that in this specific case is n-dimensional torus space, and avoid the use of regularization.[1][35] TorusE defines the distance functions to substitute the L1 and L2 norm of TransE.[5]\nRotatE:[36] RotatE is inspired by the Euler's identity and involves the use of Hadamard product to represent a relation \nr\n{\\displaystyle r} as a rotation from the head \nh\n{\\displaystyle h} to the tail \nt\n{\\displaystyle t} in the complex space.[36] For each element of the triple, the complex part of the embedding describes a counterclockwise rotation respect to an axis, that can be describe with the Euler's identity, whereas the modulus of the relation vector is 1.[36] It is shown that the model is capable of embedding symmetric, asymmetric, inversion, and composition relations from the knowledge graph.[36]\nDeep learning models\nThis group of embedding models uses deep neural network to learn patterns from the knowledge graph that are the input data.[5] These models have the generality to distinguish the type of entity and relation, temporal information, path information, underlay structured information,[19] and resolve the limitations of distance-based and semantic-matching-based models in representing all the features of a knowledge graph.[1] The use of deep learning for knowledge graph embedding has shown good predictive performance even if they are more expensive in the training phase, data-hungry, and often required a pre-trained embedding representation of knowledge graph coming from a different embedding model.[1][5]\n\nConvolutional neural networks\nThis family of models, instead of using fully connected layers, employs one or more convolutional layers that convolve the input data applying a low-dimensional filter capable of embedding complex structures with few parameters by learning nonlinear features.[1][5][19]\n\nConvE:[37] ConvE is an embedding model that represents a good tradeoff expressiveness of deep learning models and computational expensiveness,[18] in fact it is shown that it used 8x less parameters, when compared to DistMult.[37] ConvE uses a one-dimensional \nd\n{\\displaystyle d}-sized embedding to represent the entities and relations of a knowledge graph.[5][37] To compute the score function of a triple, ConvE apply a simple procedure: first concatenes and merge the embeddings of the head of the triple and the relation in a single data \n[\nh\n;\nr\n]\n{\\displaystyle {\\ce {[h;{\\mathcal {r}}]}}}, then this matrix is used as input for the 2D convolutional layer.[5][18] The result is then passed through a dense layer that apply a linear transformation parameterized by the matrix \nW\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {W}}} and at the end, with the inner product is linked to the tail triple.[5][19] ConvE is also particularly efficient in the evaluation procedure: using a 1-N scoring, the model matches, given a head and a relation, all the tails at the same time, saving a lot of evaluation time when compared to the 1-1 evaluation program of the other models.[19]\nConvR:[38] ConvR is an adaptive convolutional network aimed to deeply represent all the possible interactions between the entities and the relations.[38] For this task, ConvR, computes convolutional filter for each relation, and, when required, applies these filters to the entity of interest to extract convoluted features.[38] The procedure to compute the score of triple is the same as ConvE.[5]\nConvKB:[39] ConvKB, to compute score function of a given triple \n(\nh\n,\nr\n,\nt\n)\n{\\displaystyle (h,r,t)}, it produces an input \n[\nh\n;\nr\n;\nt\n]\n{\\displaystyle {\\ce {[h;{\\mathcal {r}};t]}}}of dimension \nd\n×\n3\n{\\displaystyle d\\times 3} without reshaping and passes it to series of convolutional filter of size \n1\n×\n3\n{\\displaystyle 1\\times 3}.[39] This result feeds a dense layer with only one neuron that produces the final score.[39] The single final neuron makes this architecture as a binary classifier in which the fact could be true or false.[5] A difference with ConvE is that the dimensionality of the entities is not changed.[18]\nCapsule neural networks\nThis family of models uses capsule neural networks to create a more stable representation that is able to recognize a feature in the input without losing spatial information.[5] The network is composed of convolutional layers, but they are organized in capsules, and the overall result of a capsule is sent to a higher-capsule decided by a dynamic process routine.[5]\n\nCapsE:[40] CapsE implements a capsule network to model a fact \n(\nh\n,\nr\n,\nt\n)\n{\\displaystyle (h,r,t)}.[40] As in ConvKB, each triple element is concatenated to build a matrix \n[\nh\n;\nr\n;\nt\n]\n{\\displaystyle {\\ce {[h;{\\mathcal {r}};t]}}}and is used to feed to a convolutional layer to extract the convolutional features.[5][40] These features are then redirected to a capsule to produce a continuous vector, more the vector is long, more the fact is true.[40]\nRecurrent neural networks\nThis class of models leverages the use of recurrent neural network.[5] The advantage of this architecture is to memorize a sequence of fact, rather than just elaborate single events.[41]\n\nRSN:[41] During the embedding procedure is commonly assumed that, similar entities has similar relations.[41] In practice, this type of information is not leveraged, because the embedding is computed just on the undergoing fact rather than a history of facts.[41] Recurrent skipping networks (RSN) uses a recurrent neural network to learn relational path using a random walk sampling.[5][41]\nModel performance\nThe machine learning task for knowledge graph embedding that is more often used to evaluate the embedding accuracy of the models is the link prediction.[1][3][5][6][7][19] Rossi et al.[5] produced an extensive benchmark of the models, but also other surveys produces similar results.[3][7][19][26] The benchmark involves five datasets FB15k,[9] WN18,[9] FB15k-237,[42] WN18RR,[37] and YAGO3-10.[43] More recently, it has been discussed that these datasets are far away from real-world applications, and other datasets should be integrated as a standard benchmark.[44]\n\nTable summary of the

This task typically involves developing a supervised underlying scheme of classes and allocating publications to the most relevant class. In this article, we implement an end-to-end automated solution using embedding quantization and a Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline. Our case study starts with a dataset of 25,000 arXiv publications from Computational Linguistics (cs.CL), published before July 2024, which we organize under a novel scheme of classes.\n\nMethodology\nOur approach centers on three key tasks: (i) unsupervised clustering of the arXiv dataset into related collections, (ii) discovering the latent thematic structures within each cluster, and (iii) creating a candidate taxonomy scheme based on said thematic structures.\n\nAt its core, the clustering task requires identifying a sufficient number of similar examples within an unlabeled dataset. This is a natural task for embeddings, as they capture semantic relationships in a corpus and can be provided as input features to a clustering algorithm for establishing similarity links among examples. We begin by transforming the (title:abstract) pairs of our dataset into an embeddings representation using Jina-Embeddings-v2, a BERT-ALiBi based attention model. And applying scalar quantization using both Sentence Transformers and a custom implementation.\n\nFor clustering, we run HDBSCAN in a reduced dimensional space, comparing the results using eom and leaf clustering methods. Additionally, we examine whether applying (u)int8 embeddings quantization instead of float32 representations affects this process.\n\nTo uncover latent topics within each cluster of arXiv publications, we combine LangChain and Pydantic with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (and GPT-4o, included for comparison) into an LLM-pipeline. The output is then incorporated into a refined prompt template that guides Claude Sonnet 3.5 in generating a hierarchical taxonomy.\n\nThe results hint at 35 emerging research topics, wherein each topic comprises at least 100 publications. These are organized within 7 parent classes and 20 subclasses in the field of Computational Linguistics (cs.CL). This approach may serve as a baseline for automatically generating hierarchical candidate schemes in high-level arXiv categories and efficiently completing taxonomies, addressing the challenge posed by the increasing volume of academic literature.\n\n\nTaxonomy Completion of Academic Literature with Embedding Quantization and an LLM-Pipeline\n1. Embedding Transformation\nEmbeddings are numerical representations of real-world objects like text, images, and audio that encapsulate semantic information of the data they represent. They are used by AI models to understand complex knowledge domains in downstream applications such as clustering, information retrieval, and semantic understanding tasks, among others.\n\nSupporting Large Sequences\nWe will map (title:abstract) pairs from arXiv publications to a 768-dimensional space using Jina-Embeddings-v2 [1], an open-source text embedding model capable of accommodating up to 8192 tokens. This provides a sufficiently large sequence length for titles, abstracts, and other document sections that might be relevant. To overcome the conventional 512-token limit present in other models, Jina-Embeddings-v2 incorporates bidirectional ALiBi [2] into the BERT framework. ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) enables input length extrapolation (i.e., sequences exceeding 2048 tokens) by encoding positional information directly within the self-attention layer, instead of introducing positional embeddings. In practice, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance, favoring stronger mutual attention between proximate tokens.\n\nEncoding with Sentence Transformers\nThe first step to using the Jina-Embeddings-v2 model is to load it through Sentence Transformers, a framework for accessing state-of-the-art models that is available at the Hugging Face Hub:\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-en', trust_remote_code=True)\n\nWe now encode (title:abstract) pairs of our dataset using batch_size = 64. This allows for parallel computation on hardware accelerators like GPUs (albeit at the cost of requiring more memory):\n\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nds = load_dataset(\"dcarpintero/arxiv.cs.CL.25k\", split=\"train\")\n\ncorpus = [title + ':' + abstract for title, abstract in zip(ds['title'], ds['abstract'])]\nf32_embeddings = model.encode(corpus,\n                              batch_size=64,\n                              show_progress_bar=True)\n\nComputing Semantic Similarity\nThe semantic similarity between corpora can now be trivially computed as the inner product of embeddings. In the following heat map, each entry [x, y] is colored based on said embeddings product for exemplary 'title' sentences [x] and [y].\n\n\nSemantic Similary in cs.CL arXiv-titles using Embeddings\n2. Embedding Quantization for Memory Saving\nScaling up embeddings can be challenging. Currently, state-of-the-art models represent each embedding as float32, which requires 4 bytes of memory. Given that Jina-Embeddings-v2 maps text to a 768-dimensional space, the memory requirements for our dataset would be around 73 MB, without indexes and other metadata related to the publication records:\n\n25,000 embeddings * 768 dimensions/embedding * 4 bytes/dimension = 76,800,000 bytes\n76,800,000 bytes / (1024^2) ≈ 73.24 MB\n\nHowever, working with a larger dataset might increase significantly the memory requirements and associated costs:\n\nEmbedding\nDimension\tEmbedding\nModel\t2.5M\nArXiv Abstracts\t60.9M\nWikipedia Pages\t100M\nEmbeddings\n384\tall-MiniLM-L12-v2\t3.57 GB\t85.26 GB\t142.88 GB\n768\tall-mpnet-base-v2\t7.15 GB\t170.52 GB\t285.76 GB\n768\tjina-embeddings-v2\t7.15 GB\t170.52 GB\t285.76 GB\n1536\topenai-text-embedding-3-small\t14.31 GB\t341.04 GB\t571.53 GB\n3072\topenai-text-embedding-3-large\t28.61 GB\t682.08 GB\t1.143 TB\nA technique used to achieve memory saving is Quantization. The intuition behind this approach is that we can discretize floating-point values by mapping their range [f_max, f_min] into a smaller range of fixed-point numbers [q_max, q_min], and linearly distributing all values between these ranges. In practice, this typically reduces the precision of a 32-bit floating-point to lower bit widths like 8-bits (scalar quantization) or 1-bit values (binary quantization).\n\n\nScalar Embedding Quantization - from float32 to (u)int8\nBy plotting the frequency distribution of the Jina-generated embeddings, we observe that the values are indeed concentrated around a relatively narrow range [-2.0, +2.0]. This means we can effectively map float32 values to 256 (u)int8 buckets without significant loss of information:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.hist(f32_embeddings.flatten(), bins=250, edgecolor='C0')\nplt.xlabel('float-32 jina-embeddings-v2')\nplt.title('distribution')\nplt.show()\n\n\nOriginal float32 jina-embeddings-v2 distribution\nWe can calculate the exact [min, max] values of the distribution:\n\nnp.min(f32_embeddings), np.max(f32_embeddings)\n(-2.0162134, 2.074683)\n\nThe first step to implementing scalar quantization is to define a calibration set of embeddings. A typical starting point is a subset of 10k embeddings, which in our case would cover nearly 99.98% of the original float32 embedding values. The use of calibration is intended to obtain representative f_min and f_max values along each dimension to reduce the computational overhead and potential issues caused by outliers that might appear in larger datasets.\n\ndef calibration_accuracy(embeddings: np.ndarray, k: int = 10000) -> float:\n  calibration_embeddings = embeddings[:k]\n  f_min = np.min(calibration_embeddings, axis=0)\n  f_max = np.max(calibration_embeddings, axis=0)\n\n  # Calculate percentage in range for each dimension\n  size = embeddings.shape[0]\n  avg = []\n  for i in range(embeddings.shape[1]):\n      in_range = np.sum((embeddings[:, i] >= f_min[i]) & (embeddings[:, i] <= f_max[i]))\n      dim_percentage = (in_range / size) * 100\n      avg.append(dim_percentage)\n\n  return np.mean(avg)\n\nacc = calibration_accuracy(f32_embeddings, k=10000)\nprint(f\"Average percentage of embeddings within [f_min, f_max] calibration: {acc:.5f}%\")\nAverage percentage of embeddings within [f_min, f_max] calibration: 99.98636%\n\nThe second and third steps of scalar quantization — computing scales and zero point, and encoding — can be easily applied with Sentence Transformers, resulting in a 4x memory saving compared to the original float32 representation. Moreover, we will also benefit from faster arithmetic operations since matrix multiplication can be performed more quickly with integer arithmetic.\n\nfrom sentence_transformers.quantization import quantize_embeddings\n\n# quantization is applied in a post-processing step\nint8_embeddings = quantize_embeddings(\n    np.array(f32_embeddings),\n    precision=\"int8\",\n    calibration_embeddings=np.array(f32_embeddings[:10000]),\n)\n\nf32_embeddings.dtype, f32_embeddings.shape, f32_embeddings.nbytes\n(dtype('float32'), (25107, 768), 77128704) # 73.5 MB\n\nint8_embeddings.dtype, int8_embeddings.shape, int8_embeddings.nbytes\n(dtype('int8'), (25107, 768), 19282176)    # 18.3 MB\n\n# calculate compression\n(f32_embeddings.nbytes - int8_embeddings.nbytes) / f32_embeddings.nbytes * 100\n75.0\n\nFor completeness, we implement a scalar quantization method to illustrate those three steps:\n\ndef scalar_quantize_embeddings(embeddings: np.ndarray,\n                               calibration_embeddings: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate [f_min, f_max] per dimension from the calibration set \n    f_min = np.min(calibration_embeddings, axis=0)\n    f_max = np.max(calibration_embeddings, axis=0)\n\n    # Step 2: Map [f_min, f_max] to [q_min, q_max] => (scaling factors, zero point)\n    q_min = 0\n    q_max = 255\n    scales = (f_max - f_min) / (q_max - q_min)\n    zero_point = 0 # uint8 quantization maps inherently min_values to zero\n\n    # Step 3: encode (scale, round)\n    quantized_embeddings = ((embeddings - f_min) / scales).astype(np.uint8)\n\n    return quantized_embeddings\n\ncalibration_embeddings = f32_embeddings[:10000]\nbeta_uint8_embeddings = scalar_quantize_embeddings(f32_embeddings, calibration_embeddings)\n\nbeta_uint8_embeddings[5000][64:128].reshape(8, 8)\n\narray([[187, 111,  96, 128, 116, 129, 130, 122],\n       [132, 153,  72, 136,  94, 120, 112,  93],\n       [143, 121, 137, 143, 195, 159,  90,  93],\n       [178, 189, 143,  99,  99, 151,  93, 102],\n       [179, 104, 146, 150, 176,  94, 148, 118],\n       [161, 138,  90, 122,  93, 146, 140, 129],\n       [121, 115, 153, 118, 107,  45,  70, 171],\n       [207,  53,  67, 115, 223, 105, 124, 158]], dtype=uint8)\n\nWe will continue with the version of the embeddings that have been quantized using Sentence Transformers (our custom implementation is also included in the results analysis):\n\n# `f32_embeddings` => if you prefer to not use quantization\n# `beta_uint8_embeddings` => to check our custom implemention\nembeddings = int8_embeddings \n\n3. Projecting Embeddings for Dimensionality Reduction\nIn this section, we perform a two-stage projection of (title:abstract) embedding pairs from their original high-dimensional space (768) to lower dimensions, namely:\n\n5 dimensions for reducing computational complexity during clustering, and\n2 dimensions for enabling visual representation in (x, y) coordinates.\nFor both projections, we employ UMAP [3], a popular dimensionality reduction technique known for its effectiveness in preserving both the local and global data structures. In practice, this makes it a preferred choice for handling complex datasets with high-dimensional embeddings:\n\nimport umap\n\nembedding_5d = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=100, # consider 100 nearest neighbors for each point\n                         n_components=5,  # reduce embedding space from 768 to 5 dimensions\n                         min_dist=0.1,    # maintain local and global balance\n                         metric='cosine').fit_transform(embeddings)\n\nembedding_2d = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=100,\n                         n_components=2,\n                         min_dist=0.1,\n                         metric='cosine').fit_transform(embeddings)\n\nNote that when we apply HDBSCAN clustering in the next step, the clusters found will be influenced by how UMAP preserved the local structures. A smaller n_neighbors value means UMAP will focus more on local structures, whereas a larger value allows capturing more global representations, which might be beneficial for understanding overall patterns in the data.\n\n4. Semantic Clustering\nThe reduced (title:abstract) embeddings can now be used as input features of a clustering algorithm, enabling the identification of related categories based on embedding distances.\n\nWe have opted for HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) [4], an advanced clustering algorithm that extends DBSCAN by adapting to varying density clusters. Unlike K-Means which requires pre-specifying the number of clusters, HDBSCAN has only one important hyperparameter, n, which establishes the minimum number of examples to include in a cluster.\n\nHDBSCAN works by first transforming the data space according to the density of the data points, making denser regions (areas where data points are close together in high numbers) more attractive for cluster formation. The algorithm then builds a hierarchy of clusters based on the minimum cluster size established by the hyperparameter n. This allows it to distinguish between noise (sparse areas) and dense regions (potential clusters). Finally, HDBSCAN condenses this hierarchy to derive the most persistent clusters, identifying clusters of different densities and shapes. As a density-based method, it can also detect outliers.\n\nimport hdbscan\n\nhdbs = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=100,            # conservative clusters' size\n                       metric='euclidean',              # points distance metric\n                       cluster_selection_method='leaf') # favour fine grained clustering\nclusters = hdbs.fit_predict(embedding_5d)               # apply HDBSCAN on reduced UMAP\n\nThe cluster_selection_method determines how HDBSCAN selects flat clusters from the tree hierarchy. In our case, using eom (Excess of Mass) cluster selection method in combination with embedding quantization tended to create a few larger, less specific clusters. These clusters would have required a further reclustering process to extract meaningful latent topics. Instead, by switching to the leaf selection method, we guided the algorithm to select leaf nodes from the cluster hierarchy, which produced a more fine-grained clustering compared to the Excess of Mass method:\n\n\nHDBSCAN eom & leaf clustering method comparison using int8-embedding-quantization\n5. Uncovering Latent Topics with an LLM-Pipeline\nHaving performed the clustering step, we now illustrate how to infer the latent topic of each cluster by combining an LLM such as Mistral-7B-Instruct [5] with Pydantic and LangChain to create an LLM pipeline that generates output in a composable structured format.\n\n5.1 Pydantic Model\nPydantic Models are classes that derive from pydantic.BaseModel, defining fields as type-annotated attributes. They are similar to Python dataclasses. However, they have been designed with subtle but significant differences that optimize various operations such as validation, serialization, and JSON schema generation. Our Topic class defines a field named label. This will generate LLM output in a structured format, rather than a free-form text block, facilitating easier processing and analysis.\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass Topic(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Pydantic Model to generate an structured Topic Model\n    \"\"\"\n    label: str = Field(..., description=\"Identified topic\")\n\n5.2 Langchain Prompt Template\nLangChain Prompt Templates are pre-defined recipes for translating user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. We define here the prompt for our intended task:\n\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\ntopic_prompt = \"\"\"\n  You are a helpful research assistant. Your task is to analyze a set of research paper\n  titles related to Natural Language Processing, and determine the overarching topic. \n            \n  INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n  1. Based on the titles provided, identify the most relevant topic:\n    - Ensure the topic is concise and clear.\n            \n  2. Format Respose:\n    - Ensure the title response is in JSON as in the 'OUTPUT OUTPUT' section below.\n    - No follow up questions are needed.\n\n  OUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n  {{\"label\": \"Topic Name\"}}\n\n  TITLES:\n  {titles}\n  \"\"\"\n\n5.3 Inference Chain using LangChain Expression Language\nLet's now compose a topic modeling pipeline using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to render our prompt template into LLM input, and parse the inference output as JSON:\n\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nfrom langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEndpoint\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser\n\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef TopicModeling(titles: List[str]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Infer the common topic of the given titles w/ LangChain, Pydantic, OpenAI\n    \"\"\"\n    repo_id = \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\"\n    llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(\n        repo_id=repo_id,\n        temperature=0.2,\n        huggingfacehub_api_token=os.environ[\"HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN\"]\n    )\n    prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(topic_prompt)\n    parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Topic)\n\n    topic_chain = prompt | llm | parser\n    return topic_chain.invoke({\"titles\": titles})\n\nTo enable the model to infer the topic of each cluster, we include a subset of 25 paper titles from each cluster as part of the LLM input:\n\ntopics = []\nfor i, cluster in df.groupby('cluster'):\n    titles = cluster['title'].sample(25).tolist()\n    topic = TopicModeling(titles)\n    topics.append(topic.label)\n\nLet's assign each arXiv publication to its corresponding cluster:\n\nn_clusters = len(df['cluster'].unique())\n\ntopic_map = dict(zip(range(n_clusters), topics))\ndf['topic'] = df['cluster'].map(topic_map)\n\n6. Generating a Taxonomy\nTo create a hierarchical taxonomy, we craft a prompt to guide Claude Sonnet 3.5 in organizing the identified research topics corresponding to each cluster into a hierarchical scheme:\n\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate\n\ntaxonomy_prompt = \"\"\"\n    Create a comprehensive and well-structured taxonomy\n    for the ArXiv cs.CL (Computational Linguistics) category.\n    This taxonomy should organize subtopics in a logical manner.\n\n    INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n    1. Review and Refine Subtopics:\n      - Examine the provided list of subtopics in computational linguistics.\n      - Ensure each subtopic is clearly defined and distinct from others.\n\n    2. Create Definitions:\n      - For each subtopic, provide a concise definition (1-2 sentences).\n\n    3. Develop a Hierarchical Structure:\n      - Group related subtopics into broader categories.\n      - Create a multi-level hierarchy, with top-level categories and nested subcategories.\n      - Ensure that the structure is logical and intuitive for researchers in the field.\n\n    4. Validate and Refine:\n      - Review the entire taxonomy for consistency, completeness, and clarity.\n\n    OUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n    - Present the final taxonomy in a clear, hierarchical format, with:\n\n      . Main categories\n        .. Subcategories\n          ... Individual topics with their definitions\n\n    SUBTOPICS:\n    {taxonomy_subtopics}\n    \"\"\"\n\n7. Results\n7.1 Clustering Analysis\nLet's create an interactive scatter plot:\n\nchart = alt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=5).encode(\n    x='x',\n    y='y',\n    color='topic:N',\n    tooltip=['title', 'topic']\n).interactive().properties(\n    title='Clustering and Topic Modeling | 25k arXiv cs.CL publications)',\n    width=600,\n    height=400,\n)\nchart.display()\n\nAnd compare the clustering results using float32 embedding representations and int8 Sentence Transformers quantization:\n\n\nHDBSCAN leaf-clustering using float32 & quantized-int8 embeddings (sentence-transformers-quantization)\nWe now perform the same comparison with our custom quantization implementation:\n\n\nHDBSCAN leaf-clustering using float32 & quantized-uint8 embeddings (self-quantization-implementation)\nThe clustering results using float32 and (u)int8 quantized embeddings show a similar general layout of well-defined clusters, indicating that (i) the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm was effective in both cases, and (ii) the core relationships in the data were maintained after quantization (using sentence transformers and our custom implementation).\n\nNotably, it can be observed that using embedding quantization resulted in both cases in slightly more granular clustering (35 clusters versus 31) that appears to be semantically coherent. Our tentative hypothesis for this difference is that scalar quantization might paradoxically guide the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to separate points that were previously grouped together.\n\nThis could be due to (i) noise (quantization can create small noisy variations in the data, which might have a sort of regularization effect and lead to more sensitive clustering decisions), or due to (ii) the difference in numerical precision and alteration of distance calculations (this could amplify certain differences between points that were less pronounced in the float32 representation). Further investigation would be necessary to fully understand the implications of quantization on clustering.\n\n7.2 Taxonomy Scheme\nThe entire hierarchical scheme is available at cs.CL.taxonomy.

He's pointing out that the paper gives us the clustering/taxonomy piece, but we discussed much more than that - we talked about ontological knowledge graphs, different approaches (OWL, SKOS, GIST, BFO), and how to integrate his values-driven approach. He wants to know:\n\n1. How to go beyond just copying the paper's clustering approach\n2. How to build the ontological knowledge graph layer  \n3. Which specific technology/framework to choose for the knowledge graph\n\nLet me think through this systematically:\n\n**What we discussed beyond the paper:**\n- Ontological frameworks (OWL, SKOS, BFO, GIST)\n- Values-driven constraints (Palestine priority, family integration)\n- PMEST classification structure\n- Faceted browsing and semantic relationships\n- Personal epistemology and validation frameworks\n- The three approaches (complex→simple) for different maturity levels\n\n**For the knowledge graph component:**\n- Need to choose between different tech stacks\n- RDF/OWL with something like Apache Jena or GraphDB\n- Property graphs with Neo4j\n- Lighter-weight options like simple JSON-LD or even structured markdown\n- Consider hybrid approaches\n\n**Integration challenge:**\n- The paper gives us automatic clustering → topics → taxonomy\n- But we also want formal ontological relationships, axioms, constraints\n- Need to bridge between statistical clustering and logical relationships\n- Plus Bilal's personal values and epistemological framework\n\nLet me recommend a pragmatic approach that builds on the paper but adds the ontological layer.Excellent point, Bilal! The paper gives us **automatic taxonomy discovery**, but we need to go way beyond that to build the **ontological knowledge graph layer** with your values-driven constraints. Let me map out the full architecture.\n\n## 🏗️ **Beyond the Paper: Complete Architecture**\n\nThe paper gets us **statistical clustering → topics → flat taxonomy**.

Which specific technology/framework to choose for the knowledge graph\n\nLet me think through this systematically:\n\n**What we discussed beyond the paper:**\n- Ontological frameworks (OWL, SKOS, BFO, GIST)\n- Values-driven constraints (Palestine priority, family integration)\n- PMEST classification structure\n- Faceted browsing and semantic relationships\n- Personal epistemology and validation frameworks\n- The three approaches (complex→simple) for different maturity levels\n\n**For the knowledge graph component:**\n- Need to choose between different tech stacks\n- RDF/OWL with something like Apache Jena or GraphDB\n- Property graphs with Neo4j\n- Lighter-weight options like simple JSON-LD or even structured markdown\n- Consider hybrid approaches\n\n**Integration challenge:**\n- The paper gives us automatic clustering → topics → taxonomy\n- But we also want formal ontological relationships, axioms, constraints\n- Need to bridge between statistical clustering and logical relationships\n- Plus Bilal's personal values and epistemological framework\n\nLet me recommend a pragmatic approach that builds on the paper but adds the ontological layer.",
