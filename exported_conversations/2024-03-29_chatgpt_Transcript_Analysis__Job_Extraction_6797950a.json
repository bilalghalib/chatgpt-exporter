Based on your answers, I will focus on:\n\n1. **Identifying the two job positions:** I'll look for information related to a Project Management role for a long-term wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) construction project, and a more dynamic, short-term role that involves Project Management with additional responsibilities in data analysis and coordination for a prototype project.\n\n2. **Navigating the complexity of the transcript:** I'll concentrate on extracting relevant information while accounting for potential inconsistencies or garbled text, especially considering the partial use of Arabic.\n\n3. **General approach:** Without specific jargon or acronyms to look out for, I'll rely on standard project management and construction terminology to guide the extraction of job descriptions and key concepts.\n\nPlease feel free to share the transcript when you're ready, and I'll begin the analysis.",

25th.\n30:38 Of April So let us plan a trip.\n30:42 All right, and we're gonna Do you not see that?\n31:13 We have seen already?\n31:14 You have got more.\n31:15 Yeah, I didn't see it first.\n31:17 And you here if we don't have any more baguette, right?\n33:41 Hmm.\n33:45 Yeah.\n33:47 It did you still want you want to be careful when I eat?\n34:28 Oh, yeah, I can work upstairs.\n34:29 Sorry.\n36:09 if I don't mind saying I like the sun.\n37:42 It here it Good day so far.\n44:40 Here you if Did you see the bridge of Baltimore collapse?\n59:43 Crazy But the cars were on it.\n59:48 Yeah, no way.\n59:50 It hmm you Where would you like to stay when we're both?\n74:29 Close the Farah.\n74:32 On the 15th Okay.\n74:35 Something Told me I will be going in.\n75:42 You so emilam.\n82:27 Okay.\n82:27 So I just downloaded these two this one and you can see they are slightly different font sizes.\n82:36 You see that?\n82:39 Nope.\n82:40 Yeah, so they're slightly different font sizes.\n82:41 And so let us try to keep them and then also the Stars shouldn't move at all because they should be just exactly the same these two this one and that one you see.\n82:55 I am not sure why that is different.\n82:57 Maybe one of them was from me and one of them is from you.\n83:00 So let us look at a third one.\n83:02 Taking in a shot and taking initiative this mobile and not mobilizing others.\n83:07 Let us look at the first one.\n83:09 This one's from me.\n83:09 So let us see what this one looks like.\n83:11 Let us click it and then download it.\n83:14 And then open it.\n83:17 And so this is what it looks like.\n83:19 Oh, wait, why is it full screen?\n83:21 Oh, yeah, that's because it's How it's supposed to be?\n83:27 Okay, but with one is it most like oh looks like it's also a different font?\n83:32 So this is how vedica knew.\n83:35 Even though this is strange.\n83:39 Look, I can't I can highlight the text over here.\n83:43 Can't highlight in this one.\n83:45 Hmm interesting that's also open on the computer and see what it looks like.\n83:49 Okay, so they seem to be slightly different.\n83:52 So this one looks like that looks like see they're different and that one looks like that.\n83:58 Yeah, it is a different font.\n84:05 I am also they're kind of close.\n84:10 Yeah, it looks very different.\n84:14 Alright, I am gonna see how it looks like on the web.\n84:19 But right now just let us try to make sure that it remember how I was trying to fix the canvas.\n84:25 The canvas should be exactly like this.\n84:28 Like it's the size of the badge itself.\n84:30 It shouldn't be bigger or smaller.\n84:32 So you see how you can make it exactly the right size.\n84:35 That means that there's no extra space around it.\n84:38 That's good.\n84:39 We need that.\n84:39 This one these have empty space that was trying to figure out what you see all this like white stuff.\n84:45 And then also the font is slightly different.\n84:48 So I know the font is going to be slightly different on here.\n84:52 That's fine.\n84:53 It should actually look like this because this is the standard no font when you export it.\n84:59 I think you have to say like don't make outlines.\n85:03 I think that might be the difference.\n85:04 Okay, so I think you actually exploring it with outline.\n85:07 So you see how I can make this text.\n85:08 This is actually text this thanks you made them outlines.\n85:12 Yeah.\n85:13 Okay, so that's just updates.\n85:16 Why I asked like, you know double check with me because I just want to make sure we got it right and some details here to fix.\n85:22 Does that make sense?\n85:23 Have you bro wasn't all clear.\n86:39 Like if you can hear it.\n86:41 There's nothing to hear.\n86:41 But yeah, I got the last part of it and like it's about the people to like just as they want and this is like, you know, this is something that they shouldn't worry about like will treat them.\n86:55 So well, you know and all of them like people that I know, you know, so I considered them friends family, whatever neighbor see this is so it's not like they're far people random people the people that are hungry are fewer friends.\n87:09 Really?\n87:11 Yeah.\n87:12 He's like beautiful.\n87:14 Why are you gonna feed all these people?\n87:16 I know people that are hungry.\n87:17 So good.\n87:19 That's great.\n87:24 Okay.\n87:28 Oh.\n87:36 I will do this meaning first and then I will pray more.\n87:40 Mishmila This is so cool.\n87:48 I will see that I know.\n87:58 Helena and Sonic without you virtual background Hey, well, I wish I was at some day Yanni and this all right.\n88:23 Okay.\n88:29 It's just my only astrology we are Miriam, and I am in China biryanizers safash China and then there's total animacharya what has been here like so when yeah, I talked about Glacier Lee they're going to be here.\n88:58 We made a 3D printed version or hotlanta shape of I technology and Hadith ever since Sean Tyler Cost like well here domain.\n89:18 And that's about and then so you are Manchester powerment startup was a child why the mistake holders Mariam wouldn't I follow up?\n89:33 I thought I she was part of the it's been practically how the domain oh, yeah, the Cleveland that's roughly who was tomorrow?\n89:53 Below and already went we can hear.\n90:09 You and I But in the summer then here, but I had this Masters Bill Henderson Medina and Structural Engineering Malaysia.\n90:43 Jamaica that I love you.\n90:56 60 68 coverages money here can start drama not a Buccaneer for some 8% of the metric still 82 Ah, okay.\n91:29 I imagine that I just learn best, you know, please.\n92:04 Yeah, let us look.\n92:06 I know you very coincide Dual Purpose quality Dual Purpose the Indonesia, and yes.\n92:13 I will engineer or in an element here like he's better to try like a Shia anime kids later.\n92:31 But yeah, hello.\n92:34 Let me know.\n92:35 Illegal and had them in photography or having fun here sure in a wastewater treatment plants.\n92:50 Or Australians a few months after college.\n92:58 The other Technologies might take the they can't build anything there except.\n93:14 A technology America 50 website This level about hey, this is what side the background technology for primary treatment has it on topograph for secondary treatment Valera and fear low cost and low foot protection.\n93:41 I need to even 20% of the regular wastewater treatment plant and in addition it controls all Jeff Mark order and a Wasatch and other control mediation research understand.\n94:03 Job, it's okay.\n94:14 They are waiting.\n94:18 We are waiting for the approval from was just a prime minister office.\n94:27 You know, they want emergency funds.\n94:31 They know how that I priority project that I had a she in the meantime, we're going to do pilot study.\n94:38 So in miniature treatment plants, but in makan we should know I still government and Design.\n94:49 The second two steps seclus is funding is available.\n94:54 And we passed the pilot study like nibdi design.\n95:00 It designed a high configure negative.\n95:04 In America, you know and my iPhone she said here.\n95:27 And fikra and water engineering technology wet Sherry kumarate name rotational design and the answer is that Home where they do the plans and facts about they what will their individuals they do cure aqc.\n95:49 And they look at the plans.\n95:52 They look at this text, and they compare things to the actual conditioner.\n96:00 And read it could in the presence of turkey or Valera and oversee the design a cartoonil and your role.\n96:11 It's just an Ina a raw matter.\n96:13 He could oversee the construction also and so on what kind of person he will be whether he's Familiar of construction to the degree where he could oversee the construction contractor.\n96:28 This is something we will determine later but I don't expect the same person who do both jobs in what specialized each one is very specialized the first project first person that he need to have a lot of communication a lot of knowledge about how to deal with issues how to deal with the Turkish designer.\n96:55 He doesn't need to speak Turkish.\n96:57 They speak a little bit English, but we have You on our team?\n97:01 He's influence in Turkey.\n97:04 If we need help where the partners are three myself Dr. Phila was a civil engineer.\n97:13 As well.\n97:13 Yeah, the long company and a contractor.\n97:16 An error the contact is only in Iran felaf lives in turkey, and he's the marketing guy.\n97:26 The guy who was in contact with everybody.\n97:29 So what is independent company in order to, but we have partnership, and we will possible for design?\n97:39 It's our call how to design it.\n97:41 Who's the company that we hire?\n97:43 How do the qaqc communicate the person to be in charge he has to be very well in communication know that when to evolve other specialty people, and he doesn't need to know everything because this is a monthly disciplinary?\n98:05 Project includes mechanical and electrical structural geotechnical Hydraulics process.\n98:14 So we don't expect somebody who knows everything what we biological which is a which is process biological and process are the same.\n98:26 Parmental also Landscaping politics everything So the person that need to really on that position, he should really manipulate a lot of moving parts.\n98:44 So now we want to know.\n98:47 What's your qualifications and Milan is here is similar to your that's why I asked allowed to join us because you similar type of work in the past?\n99:03 You did this kind of entrepreneurial project.\n99:07 And also she told me that you're in the Innovation process right you do Innovation management, is that correct?\n99:21 And master the sunny who were Innovation and Entrepreneurship and yeah Innovation and Technology.\n99:29 I am not familiar with this degree, but I get attracted to the word Innovation because the what we are doing is innovative.\n99:41 We have a patent.\n99:43 We applied an error, and we have several patterns everywhere and Europe, Japan Korea and America.\n99:52 Some of them expired some of them we didn't follow because it's too far but Iraqi patent is recent.\n00:00 We just apply it in last July.\n00:02 So we assume that after we get this project we not assume we're hoping that we will get more projects.\n00:13 So because the need is there, and we are creating something very good.\n00:23 It's small first print.\n00:25 It's covered.\n00:26 No noise.\n00:27 No, no other so this is innovation in the things that we are trying to do is to prove that this is great to work by a pilot which is going to be done in a month.\n00:44 Once we finish the pilot City we could use this final study everywhere.\n00:49 We could apply it moves it, you know project doesn't come through it will be evidence for the Yeah, of course and one of our partners is going today to Dubai to figure out if there are ways that we could get investors because we are after project an RV.\n01:15 So these things are we can promise it?\n01:19 We I have so many disappointments in my life.\n01:22 So I am used to it but so but because these are large projects a lot of politics even in the US we have a lot of politics.\n01:33 So that's what we learned that there's a need which it's incentives to the people enough to Really seek this kind of Technology because of the limited area and I think the Prime Minister has some emphasis on water and wastewater treatments and because it's a public issue.\n02:00 Of I don't have the public has any concern or any say but it looks like it has something.\n02:07 So, it's your now, it's your call.\n02:10 That I am drastic.\n02:16 Unethical character in the whole a couple politics Collision here?\n02:22 I have been a couple of school makan.\n02:25 Was it politics Will aratellite?\n02:27 What they had the art and I mean Yeah, I know.\n02:34 Who and I think will Mark here at school big sharks more sharks.\n02:42 Only Marathon Saratan, and so what I mean we are complet.\n02:56 Ely was that I can hear wonderful projects really who is an icon very interested be you know what that I just The plant will definitely part of it.\n03:28 Aren't any a link in any add value and even be here mainly charged chocolate who I bought a project management coordination?\n03:40 So he But it's the same thing.\n03:45 I mean they have different actors different stakeholders.\n03:47 Yeah, I mean, that's our community for our communication realizing, and she And the external background sound of supply chain availability Innovation entrepreneurship the husband construction and in two different academic degrees.\n04:08 It's a quite structural engineering and go ahead Innovation or what you addictor in MBA who Accra she Alina he will be able and an innovation entrepreneurship was similar to MBA.\n04:22 That's all she practical movie Theory and behavior.\n04:28 Yeah another year.\n04:29 And all how to establish your startups who grow your startup I had actually here marketing and communication and leadership and management sales Etc.\n04:43 So what are the current?\n04:45 And yeah, is that here which is the background music technology degree?\n05:00 Yes.\n05:01 Actually civil engine and the bachelor degree.\n05:07 My first Master's structural engineering and endlessly.\n05:12 I am enjoyed match, but that's montage.\n05:15 Now, come on.\n05:18 We will Master helium.\n05:20 I am at work.\n05:26 Barakanya.\n05:25 Bimano has a distribute mental healthier new Ashley, I think.\n05:36 I have to check my piano.\n05:39 Actually, I think so.\n05:40 High definition because social and if he Entirely is he but yet Supply chains that I had nahuel daratil barramid.\n06:08 Although weary and going to send here development and afraid that mustard children's.\n06:18 And have that Charlotte hendama public sector actor of public sector stakeholder, which is it being has a consultant.\n06:38 That's how the female.\n06:39 Animal he was Here in a nutshell.\n06:58 I am not like we are actually MSC Amadeus America.\n07:04 And the dog and yeah, I am at least here the America Middle East.\n07:12 Oh, I am a beast Amity.\n07:14 Hey.\n07:15 You can no Greek.\n07:18 It's American Energy established many 1950s.\n07:24 Not enough coffee will Academy.\n07:31 Yeah, I mean follow bright metal and what happened in here always and Vera welcome here.\n07:49 Are not been immortal area here woman in technology install and yeah.\n07:56 What is the biggest project Johnny you have managed?\n08:06 Size of team or size of budget I didn't know what had we AG is that?\n08:21 Can it must have providers and China dream?\n08:26 These about that in Germany.\n08:29 I have come here that I love.\n08:31 Can just focal point my gisetta project advisor who contacted two Services providers and implementer will Logistics how the service provider will hear social media.\n08:46 Company will Canada main counterpart will be?\n08:53 For 200 year coordination.\n08:57 Wow doesn't matter I will coordination will be MC to Madonna our animal.\n09:02 On G.\n09:03 Is that little money?\n09:05 But until focal point will manage my little cooler in terms of communication decision-making well actually.\n09:13 Montana projectile and the idea who were blocked in Holly who are recently that I believe and Technology.\n09:25 Oh he attacked.\n09:26 He Key Tech and here technology.\n09:38 And but that any local quarter is the technical aspect Eli who were methylene software development programming it after he sent him.\n09:58 Oh and English component soft skills component.\n10:03 For everyone proposal in the last time now.\n10:08 Oh, that's so coordination real US Embassy and US Embassy Homan.\n10:13 Oh bad, that's how we could implementation below.\n10:18 Okay?\n10:23 Or framework.\n10:30 Wallahid power supply companion And he wants to take the lead, but he or she they don't have the quality of leading but start them talk to him had a sense.\n11:03 I will ask us a normal day are leading our chocolate.\n11:07 And in a way into you inject them with what you want.\n11:12 What has a system here.\n11:20 Right, we will have some limb is Communications in malayer email a lot Natalie de harmonizukala.\n11:37 What's up how to follow up proactively could not understand Monday to start middle.\n11:44 Click up.\n11:44 Just yeah like oh, yeah.\n11:47 I have been technical one which in the allowed known as Stephanie.\n12:07 I need tools have gi said the John mainly Excel and it's the Microsoft teams Outlook this kind of aspects and here confined with secured at the we organize everything but I still external stakehold does methyl and then you still Google sweets, for example Calendar will tool my letter again.\n12:31 As the media Asia, but here in the front tools were smarter anyone.\n12:45 After the tool, I will back a yellow and I want effectively communication emotic communication.\n12:53 The Fire tour having Milestones goals tasks Microsoft projects.\n13:00 Oh my God the way yeah, and he mentioned them excel in the system with timeline where he Microsoft project, and he a kid Microsoft Project who was specialized Bill project Bill Mahal at the hustles Christmas and more and that's the head and Excel in her more any conveniently yet, but he sure, so we had to take them to him and my floor here.\n13:38 So I am like, what would you do?\n13:50 Someone that I told here meetings had enough of what she knows steps.\n14:00 My old face is my project.\n14:01 We need to identify stakeholders.\n14:03 We need to have set a meeting with young Michelle.\n14:07 I am at the national communication methods a little my father.\n14:10 We need to have a project Charter or something else in will be died.\n14:14 I had an afternoon.\n14:15 Holy option expected deliverables through a timeline.\n14:18 She knows what responsibility small ahead Las AmeriCU follow up meetings going on a regular basis weekly by weekly and I said, but if I think communication but it hasn't approval, and she doesn't buy email and listen for something handwritten and aspects having fun, and we are all online communication definitely but now taking this communication that I Just trout why?\n15:08 It timeline management to tasks and tasks or whatever.\n15:15 You know about your skills.\n15:25 It will communication.\n15:26 We will Innovation skills.\n15:28 We had some engineering Lee you just sadness is time to refine it didn't but it's kind of interesting, you know other but sure you stop at home relationally into women now we have for the Shiva.\n15:41 Robotic Asylum And get chart a total Turkish company, they will do their own gun charge or whatever they use software to do on schedules.\n15:56 So you may have to either use theirs or we could ask them to use yours, whatever you prefer and the idea is that we don't want to impose on the designer our system because they have their own system.\n16:13 Maybe they work with other people the same way.\n16:16 Maybe they are more comfortable.\n16:17 So we need to adapt to their system.\n16:20 And in addition.\n16:22 We need to incorporate any new system or our system which could be the same or different, so they should be integrating these two things that we could communicate within the team and within and the designer is in Istanbul.\n16:41 You may have to travel to Istanbul once a while or maybe stay at least when it's really heated design where there's a lot of discussion.\n16:51 The only thing Pilot program or you're talking about longer turn, right?\n16:57 The pilot program is not going to be unless we are still working on it.\n17:06 We are not going to involve the design team.\n17:09 We're not involving this we get it ourself, and we build it, and we monitor it.\n17:17 And we're going to hire somebody locally in Era to do the monitoring and guy who's going to monitor it he need to know a little bit more about the technology about the process itself.\n17:31 You need to know their biological treatment how it works.\n17:35 You need to know how to collect the samples how to analyze the data.\n17:39 So this is beyond the scope of work management for design.\n17:44 And because I don't think you will Yanni, it could up to speed on this technical skills in very short period of time this requires a lot of efforts.\n17:59 I have been working on it for a long time, and I am still not I have somebody he worked here with me in the US as a process engineer.\n18:11 I am a civil engineer.\n18:12 I am not process engineer.\n18:14 So we need this kind of people.\n18:17 When they communicate with the process engineer, they know the language.\n18:21 They know the terms they know what is the beer MBR.\n18:28 What is bbr?\n18:29 What is the air flotation device?\n18:33 Our screenings work how to collect samples of the biological process is started and ended so this is very critical for the pilot.\n18:44 So we are looking for somebody this only once We finish it.\n18:52 We could hire the full-time person because at this time we don't have the funding for the project.\n18:59 We are waiting for the funding to be released and also the test to be completed.\n19:04 So the city say, yes, we looked at the test.\n19:07 We like the results and this is a funding we find the contract, and then we could hire a full-time manager on design for time being where the team is paying for from their own expenses on the pilot.\n19:24 So this is a short term employment for one person was very familiar with the process.\n19:29 So this is two things two separate things.\n19:33 We're talking about the design.\n19:36 Once we start the design the manager will be hired, and he will be probably traveling most of the design terms time to Turkey because you may need weekly meeting with them.\n19:53 You need to know that technical issues.\n19:55 You need to learn a little bit about what they're doing what things are changing and your communication will be with a design team from the Turkish company and with the qaqc our team like myself.\n20:13 I have the process engineer here in the US.\n20:16 His name is Steve Williams, and we have also the contractor in Era we need to communicate with them because the design team made required information from Iraq about the site the survey the soul investigation.\n20:30 So the contractor I have those guys and submit them information to the design team.\n20:39 The design pool makes sense somebody there to look at the site to make sure that they understand the limitations on the side the topography also, and they learn a little bit about the politics and who is the Who are they working for?\n20:58 So all this has to be tied in together as a one unit.\n21:04 All these parts in two different countries.\n21:08 No actually three because we have people that begin to do the key if you see from here.\n21:14 So communication is important documentation is important because it happened.\n21:21 We know what happened.\n21:22 I would happen and who is responsible for it?\n21:26 And we need to talk about also legal issues.\n21:30 We need to hire a lawyer to write the contracts we need to hire people we need to have contracts with those individuals.\n21:40 It's an accurate you see or whoever is going to be working with that.\n21:47 Maybe we may need people in enough to pull up on things.\n21:52 We may hire them.\n21:53 So all of this is the project manager.\n21:56 My role is what was my role?\n22:00 Do you remember what we call myself?\n22:02 Because I used to be like this.\n22:05 I was the project manager for major projects in the US.\n22:08 And I know what it takes.\n22:11 But because I am now different position, and we may try to Market this somewhere else.\n22:18 It's more in the business part and also on the overseeing the overall picture not in the details as the project manager will be involved.\n22:29 And for example, I am not going to be involved in the Nitty Gritty communication and filing the files and making a log of all the design drawings that draft.\n22:46 Who's changing words where when it's going to be changed and who's going to be responsible for it?\n22:53 This is not my job.\n22:55 The person who is Going to be hired as project manager?\n23:01 He will coordinate all this work.\n23:03 Of course.\n23:03 We will help him.\n23:04 I have a lot of experience Steve Williams actually Steve Williams as his own company he retired, so he's a retired business guy, but he's very good in the process, and he's a resource that we can't overload them.\n23:22 He is retired.\n23:23 He just want to us on life.\n23:26 We don't want to destroy his life.\n23:27 I am retired, too.\n23:28 Well, this is how it works.\n23:31 We need to build up a team that are young, and they may take this kind of responsibility and move on and hopefully we will get to expand somewhere and then don't area or in Iraq.\n23:45 This has to be also part of the responsible of the person for example, if we want him to participate in a meeting with a new client to tell him what we are doing on for this project that will be a plus so presentation.\n24:04 We may hire many them to do the 3D modeling or something.\n24:09 These are the things that we need a project manager to use responsible for.\n24:16 You No, it's a lot.\n24:24 Not only that it's a big responsibility because it's 150 million dollar project and if fails we as the partners will fail big because financially you will be responsible for operating and because we are operating it for five years also after that so it's a design build operate and for during the operation what does not have much to contribute but the contractor was operated, but he may need the Turkish design team just in case if he has questions about the question stuff like that.\n25:09 So think about It hamar.\n25:15 It's a the only thing I could see we think is that you don't have.\n25:21 the you know the structural mostly also you have some geotechnical courses, right?\n25:28 You know, but, so I don't know how it works.\n25:30 However, Have water flow from one location to the other?\n25:35 Yeah, this is important.\n25:37 But the main part of this especially the new technology is the biological.\n25:44 So we may need Steve Williams will help us.\n25:49 But we need somebody a young person to Shadow him to take the loads from him.\n25:58 He answered this silly questions, but not the heavy left that question.\n26:04 We will refer to Steve.\n26:06 He's the expert, but we need somebody maybe you could find to help you in the process and part-time basis on process.\n26:14 Actually.\n26:15 We're going to talk somebody maybe talk somebody, you know, Miriam said just for the pilots study.\n26:28 So he knows about the process.\n26:31 So maybe he's the person that we are looking for to help.\n26:36 You in the process elements, I mean, and we're going to test him during the pilot and maybe if we decided that you are the person maybe you could be not working.\n26:52 But at least oversee or look at the pilots study because this is very important test, and we will give you some insight about how things will work.\n27:01 Okay.\n27:02 Anything below basically, I want to make sure that enough whom Elma wore Lindo we talk about two different distinct phases and different roles many different roles including like additional roles of the somebody with more experience with the biological and the process engineering and I in case I am not has any questions about anything you really know.\n27:37 I just want to make sure there's very clearly that sweet Robert.\n27:41 It's cool coolish precise with the player Beloved the way that I see a potential collaboration is between this day and this day for this part of the project and this day in the state for this part of the project that may lead into you know what I mean at the corner here design will take about six months to a year.\n28:01 That's the bulk of the design construction will take another two years.\n28:06 So the whole project is fears.\n28:09 Three years and depends on your capability as field engineer.\n28:16 You may be if you finished the design it's better to have somebody also in the field overseeing the contractor.\n28:27 Overseeing the contractor required a lot of documentation also Communications between the person the field engineer the contractor us what and the design because most of likely they will ask questions change orders changing equipments.\n28:48 (Dimensions) doesn't fit.\n28:50 So it's a lot of communication.\n28:52 We don't do the construction.\n28:55 Was just oversee the construction inform the contractor if there's any violation violations if the contractor want to change order or change something he has to go through the designer, which is the design manager and also oversight engineer.\n29:13 So it is a three years assignment if the person is willing to do both of these design management and then field oversight construction, but that's the pilot is different from first because it required a little bit more involved in terms of process engineering.\n29:38 And this is very critical tests.\n29:42 When we do want somebody who's the structural engineer or manager to manage something that he doesn't know the details about so it requires the pilot requires a management because we are involving genetic technology here.\n30:01 And they have students that they could work on the pilot study, but we need somebody to manage it and if we feel comfortable with the students that they know what they're doing they could pick up on the technology and their Steve Williams election.\n30:24 We may need just manager to manage them manage data manage it 8 construction that communicate with us and then instead of we be there, or we always look and the mind of details you could take care of the Minor Details because we are building this we are building three units one called the column test, which is a column very long large count like 20 meters up there.\n30:55 That we inject the waste in it and we monitor.\n31:00 Removal of total suspended solids and biological oxygen demand tssmvod and the other one is Aviation where we inject air to see how the bacteria reacts to the air injection.\n31:17 The third one is a device that will bring from overseas.\n31:25 It's a secondary clarifier using is called dissolved air flotation.\n31:31 It's a device that you build it to scale one scale and put it in line.\n31:37 So these are three tests will go one after the other to simulate a full toward treatment plan, and then we will monitor each stage between import and output.\n31:49 So it requires some knowledge about the biological process because it has to do with bacteria.\n31:55 It requires some information some mechanical things the country.\n32:02 Mechanical engineer which is very good.\n32:04 You will cover the mechanical process not process Mechanicals, but for the biological we need somebody if we could find a student that could help us from the University.\n32:17 We need only the management of the pilot.\n32:21 And depends on your availability, of course, you have full-time jobbed right now.\n32:28 So we don't want you to lose your full-time job for a three-month assignment on the pilots.\n32:35 And then the city says well we didn't get the funding.\n32:38 And thank you very much.\n32:41 We got what we want.\n32:42 We will wait till next year or something.\n32:45 So that's important also because we are we're paying this ourselves and the city is not going to pay for it because contract but it is conditions.\n32:59 Contact this condition on passing the test.\n33:02 So this is where we are.\n33:05 So think about it and then give us a call later see how you react to this what you think right now.\n33:22 I don't understand right now is Or American, and he is helping me for last two months mainly on Research part research contracts issue with my team.\n33:52 And so he's what's your background computer science and mostly entrepreneurship, I guess in similar to you wind up meeting to learn project management, you know kind of General.\n34:12 Project design implementation grant writing proposal writing hiring firing National everything Okay, this is out of that.\n34:24 I experience neither such is technical but I didn't, so I believe it did rough minute technical illegadreb, then I will get a degree Lawrence either a struggle technical that's in my area health is working in recycling for robots.\n34:40 I was building robotics for recycling because I didn't get it either when we talked about Arabia when she yella Helena, and it's okay.\n34:50 Yeah and he can hear but what I thought I was in the whole people with either one hadidiani issufair Island in nashobita Rim home.\n35:17 We should get home win home.\n35:19 Yes this holiday home.\n35:21 Apple had enough they moved soon.\n35:24 Will I am actually with inside?\n35:28 Yeah muscular career.\n35:33 Lemon Baba.\n35:34 Garlic.\n35:35 No one that she wanted.\n35:36 Let us see how can always talk like exercise the Medina played regarding Android.\n35:47 We will get it only for Johnson that I should know who is a Baba.\n35:53 I know I am a shark a little Hawaii how they said the boy.\n35:56 Oh, I didn't hit you really look inside the box topology that I didn't know friendly Baba or in someoneita.\n36:12 We need tea.\n36:13 That's why I had any animal in feet and in us when my own in nearby.\n36:20 Oh, it's confirm any feed.\n36:25 Oh, then he can be it.\n36:30 Oh, man.\n36:32 Asana then shook mature baby had a bill at home grants in Japan to build their wastewater treatment plant Phantom the ground who are still alive planning the planet will continue the heterogrands are less than the expense of the project and in projects are grown up so much and it's they can't afford it anymore.\n36:59 So actually here Japanese very conventional design.\n37:08 If I didn't know who employment home is so expensive they want to do the whole city new sewer system for the whole city.\n37:19 Which is ridiculous.\n37:21 It is ridiculously cost costly because they have to dig every three every connection to every house.\n37:29 So my experience for America and know who we don't treat a Wastewater with the storm.\n37:38 They have combined storm and wait for us.\n37:40 So they say okay.\n37:42 Let us solve it conventionally.\n37:44 We separate the storm and the wait for and have just the stone will go to whatever it is.\n37:53 Now.\n37:53 It's a creek like a river and with war is going to be treated outside the city 14 kilometers.\n38:01 They have minds and kilometers of jacking and buildings open cut excavations Pavements house connection.\n38:15 So what we are going to propose to them is that we keep the system as it is, and we treat the whole thing because our system treat both, so we don't need to build a new system.\n38:28 So this is a major stuff.\n38:31 This is Multi-million dollars change and since they don't have the money they could build these outfalls and at that fall they could build these units that we created that we designed for mediter public has going to divide to see if we could because we have a small company.\n38:53 We don't have the power to handle this kind of project.\n38:56 So we are trying to find a Partners but even the Turkish company, I don't think it's enough.\n39:04 So my partners to do marketing to do we need funding, so he's going there to look into and that's investors.\n39:14 He already talked to them.\n39:15 They are actually after us they want us to work with them if you want to formalize it now because now it's getting real well after something which is Big we don't know whether we are succeeded or not, but the Study is very important because that will show everybody that this system works.\n39:39 And this is an icon of the whole thing, and we could use this final study because usually we could this is analytic it to another plant location and do the product study again to confirm presence of contaminants.\n39:55 It's will treat that contaminants.\n39:57 It's a specific.\n39:59 That's why I am retired and I don't want to be in this business.\n40:05 This is too big for me.\n40:07 So we need somebody like you and Below to really pick up this and move on.\n40:15 So maybe there will be some business decisions and Business Partnership decisions.\n40:25 I don't know if you are familiar with these kind of stuff from our probably the president manager who is experience with this kind of stuff?\n40:35 He should be also part of that new team where we have Partners to work with because you will be working not for me only but other partners so the selecting of the partners, how can you negotiate with them that's important, too.\n40:54 So, I don't know if you have that experience and this kind of business type?\n40:59 So it's a multifacet thing.\n41:02 You can stay in the project management part, but eventually we are hopefully we are growing.\n41:08 So that's where we're the count of the technology here Japan International cooperation agency well, the marathon Indian reports does it take the standard element jic a shot of you know, it's the development of Japan like usaid for Japan.\n41:59 Correct.\n42:01 Farmers history standards research documentation The people that did that so well with the Japanese.\n42:18 Yeah, any era how many hunsina to follow our up and leave the idea the water standards documentation about how they gave their they did a really good.\n42:31 Now are we talking about the Japan International cooperation agency?\n42:37 Necessary and there's njs Consultants.\n42:47 Yeah, true.\n42:49 Yeah.\n42:50 Yeah.\n42:50 She you engineer.\n42:53 And Water Agency in Canada and the partners.\n43:00 Oh, Japan International Court Operation although they look like what like a non-profit version of the USA was the Japanese version.\n43:14 Only is non-profit.\n43:21 Yes.\n43:22 Oh don't religious.\n43:23 It basically the thing that funds nonprofit is like a more than an IM really.\n43:29 It's a Development Corporation.\n43:33 Hey, are you familiar with them?\n43:37 I just Randy people underst Hey.\n43:47 Come on.\n43:51 Yeah, I just want you too many things.\n43:59 You know, it's so such a big project Jordan hair.\n44:07 We had like Allah, but have the left side.\n44:09 Yeah mobile Yanni in a big picture.\n44:12 He doesn't know this for 10 being there's only project management.\n44:24 Limit and even if the pilot, but he should know what's going on with the whole effect.\n44:34 Finally, that I can.\n44:36 And Qatar thoughts that's machine.\n44:46 Below this machine.\n44:48 I just engineer the Revenant ashena today's favorite card General card Maisto because I am sure you know how to show you how Caravan got that.\n45:16 Yeah my message.\n45:23 Feet sorry internet.\n46:03 This is you.\n46:04 One page or document at least in the whole specified as occasional roll shouldn't expect Manhattan roll in duration and responsibility in a very generic way outline.\n46:31 We don't have to go into details headset.\n46:33 But after this had taken more Yanni Okay.\n46:38 I teach English.\n46:52 Yeah, no technical background.\n47:12 Yeah for a Time.\n47:19 Communication and what that she will outline Buffet of the United text documents makes a little shinya time expectation start date requirements who have been attackers were important while Hain with a cool, so I will give you our family, but just a lot of eating man.\n47:51 Imagine how it will not be why I faces?\n47:57 That's at least and a big picture now and Mama lacking can good baby steps first step in the world.\n48:06 In position starting date and date responsibility is expected outcome and behind, you know, yeah in a very draft.\n48:19 Outline and we'd have to be specific headset at the message is only clearer than Israeli, honey, and I thought I would He got the first of his sons the first son and my home what?\n48:38 Are you oh my God, and it's really easy?\n48:57 So we have discussed my example.\n49:04 Double check it.\n49:06 It will just laying farmer.\n49:11 I didn't even matter.\n49:12 I don't know if I do.\n49:13 I cash out.\n49:15 I said exactly email.\n49:16 What is a dictator side and Madam.\n49:19 I thought I said I would have what's up.\n49:21 I mind the musical level.\n49:23 Could you the idea is that I wanted to delicate right away instead of waiting for your email send it because this so much coming up?\n49:36 A fair and figurative We're not considering a mod for the pilot but not on the edge then pilot, but you know, what is the role that we're looking for?\n50:01 Maybe we can have a lot because I just yeah the pilot requires somebody who's available anymore.\n50:08 A contractor he's building the unit himself.\n50:16 The structure is a mechanical engineer, but the contractor he just Know how to build things Steve Williams in the process engineer he will put the work plan and the design it will Design them and contractor will build it on site where the pump station is, and he will import the third piece of the test which is called death dissolved air flotation, and he will install them all in line.\n50:48 And then we will start the testing.\n50:50 By injecting from one end and test it at several interments intermitted position location and test at the end, and we take the samples to the lab for TSS and build testing.\n51:07 So the guy who is going to be there he need to manage and as construction managing testing manages sapling and hopefully he could do some analysis of he knows how to do it.\n51:21 Yes smog removal rate, and we may need some adjustments on the test as we go depends on the data.\n51:31 So this will test it takes about three months.\n51:36 And this is the first test.\n51:38 Before even get a contract.\n51:41 So we will pay him but it's not from the contract to start a current long term contract.\n51:48 It's a short term contract between he himself and the contractor, you know, because Let me know I am okay again.\n52:03 Oh by then this little models open like an email a lot.\n52:09 We will be there.\n52:10 We can follow us.\n52:11 Okay.\n52:13 And that's what I will do.\n52:18 Oh, yeah, I mean that for the permission mileage coming up.\n52:21 I shall have a document we a much more admined the scenery out of home, you know and off but someone can ask phones.\n52:29 That to avoid.\n52:31 Yeah that I will refer back to you both.\n52:37 Yeah, and the patent or any communication has to defer to the patent and eventually they need to sign non-disclosure agreement the test.\n52:48 It has nothing to do with the pattern.\n52:50 It's a regular testing.\n52:54 It's a job.\n52:55 Yeah criteria list jump description.\n52:58 Yeah, we don't need an NDA for a job description.\n53:01 Okay now Mr. Oh yeah work plan already the world could hear it.\n53:08 Huh?\n53:09 Hey, you work fine, but that's like I can be the second step but I will keep up this job just time and first pass is you have the time that okay passive.\n53:21 I don't follow us.\n53:22 We don't need any more emails, but we don't need to sign ndas with everyone that doesn't have the time.\n53:26 I think that's the second pass issue.\n53:28 Yeah emphasis on the biological treatment process knowledge.\n53:32 I will make a draft name Baba by then.\n53:36 Yeah.\n53:34 It will be very basic.\n53:38 And yeah, and that's all I know.\n53:44 And that's another documents in any style.\n53:48 So I will let you know definitely.\n53:49 And actually before he that's a partner.\n54:06 Just because it's a human issue that how we work together.\n54:12 Just ask you to.\n54:15 Maybe just have a coffee with him and talk to him because and also the reason why I want to let him know that you he here just in case if things move forward he has prior knowledge about you and what you do.\n54:35 I will tell him that you're going there because you know something about a Japanese organization so it would be interested.\n54:47 How can I mean I am interested in one pager?\n54:54 If he had Moon convert I will try to find other countries and many little position left side probably a design and I will support you either, and I am with you, or I am not with you.\n55:15 Let me know.\n55:39 At the Tijuana I would selectable.\n55:44 Yeah.\n55:47 Yeah.\n55:49 Salama.",
