      "content": "I would like some help with creating a prompt that will help prototypers be able to easily figure out what is the simplest thing to build for a no-code application. So for instance, these are going to be people that are early-stage founders of an idea that they want to build, but they don't know how to build it using no-code, and they might not even know exactly which part of the project is the right part to work on, and so I want to be able to guide them step-by-step through the thinking of the no-code tool that they might want to use, the thinking of what it means to be doing a simple validation prototype of their idea, and I think it would be really great to use LLMs to be able to guide them through this whole process. I imagine it's going to be a few prompts, not a one-shot prompt, so I need to think with you step-by-step about the entire scope of perhaps one way of describing it would be to create a requirements document as if you were going to give it to a developer, and then from there go and think about what are the no-code tools available to us from Arlo and Zapier and Zaps, and maybe even simpler things like using email and some automations like Zapier, or another even simpler approach of validating with a prototype that uses zero-code, like paper or something, or calling somebody and asking, and having that all be a step-by-step prompt that I can give them to help them do this process, and I need you to think with me about exactly maybe the things I'm not thinking about. What are the space of discussion that I'm not entirely deepening into? Is it about the startup? Is it about technology? Is it about thinking about automations? Is it about thinking about the idea of creating documentation for a product, including requirements documents? I'm not sure what else they need, like mock-ups, requirements documents, commander's intent, et cetera, for them to be able to work on this thing. So do you understand the overall picture? Can you break it down, the discussion that I'm trying to do, and then maybe give me three prompts to take this prompt forward? So not the prompt that I'm going to get at, what are the next two or three prompts that I can do to clarify my idea and to clarify the scale and scope of this project to help you help me best?",

      "content": "It sounds like you're looking to develop a series of prompts to guide early-stage founders in creating a simple prototype for their idea using no-code tools. This is a multi-faceted process involving several aspects:\n\n1. **Identifying the Core Idea**: The first step is to help the founders clarify their main idea or problem they're solving. A prompt could ask them to succinctly describe their idea and the key problem it addresses.\n\n2. **Choosing the Right No-Code Tool**: Based on the idea, the next step is to identify the most suitable no-code tool. This involves understanding the capabilities of various tools like Airtable, Zapier, and others. A prompt could ask them to consider the features they need (like database management, automation, etc.) and match these with the features offered by different no-code tools.\n\n3. **Simplifying the Idea for Prototyping**: Often, the first prototype doesn't need all the features of the final product. A prompt could guide them to strip down their idea to the most basic version that can still validate their core hypothesis.\n\n4. **Documentation and Planning**: Before building, it's crucial to have a clear plan. This includes a requirements document, potential mock-ups, and a clear goal (like what they aim to test or validate with this prototype). A prompt could guide them to outline these elements.\n\n5. **Validation Approach**: Depending on their resources and the nature of the project, the validation approach can vary. It might involve building a digital prototype with no-code tools, or it could be as simple as using paper prototypes or direct customer interviews. A prompt could ask them to consider their validation strategy based on their specific context and resources.\n\nThese steps can form the basis of your prompts. Would you like to start by focusing on any specific step, or should we develop a prompt for each step?",

      "content": "Based on the information from various sources, including MIT Sloan Teaching & Learning Technologies, several key principles for crafting effective AI prompts have emerged:\n\n1. **Provide Context:** Adding context to your prompts helps AI generate more sophisticated and tailored responses. For example, specifying the role of the responder or the context of the query can significantly influence the outcome.\n\n2. **Be Specific:** Specificity in prompts leads to more targeted and relevant responses. This includes adding details like time frames, locations, or specific aspects of a topic.\n\n3. **Building on the Conversation:** AI systems, especially in chat-based interfaces, can remember earlier parts of a conversation, allowing you to build upon previous responses without repeating the context.\n\n4. **Focus on Problems, Not Just Prompts:** As AI systems evolve, the focus might shift from crafting perfect prompts to more effectively defining problems. This approach emphasizes the importance of clearly outlining the problem's scope and boundaries.\n\n5. **Be Aware of AI Limitations:** Despite advancements, AI systems can have flaws, such as factual inaccuracies or biases. It's crucial to critically assess AI-generated content and be aware of these limitations.\n\nThese principles can be applied to develop prompts for the prototyping process of a no-code application. Each prompt should provide clear context, be specific to the needs of the stage, build on previous information, focus on solving the problem at hand, and be created with an understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations. \n\nBy following these guidelines, prompts can be more effective in guiding early-stage founders through each stage of their project.",

Okay.\n\nChatGPT\nHello! How can I assist you today?\nUser\nI would like some help with creating a prompt that will help prototypers be able to easily figure out what is the simplest thing to build for a no-code application. So for instance, these are going to be people that are early-stage founders of an idea that they want to build, but they don't know how to build it using no-code, and they might not even know exactly which part of the project is the right part to work on, and so I want to be able to guide them step-by-step through the thinking of the no-code tool that they might want to use, the thinking of what it means to be doing a simple validation prototype of their idea, and I think it would be really great to use LLMs to be able to guide them through this whole process. I imagine it's going to be a few prompts, not a one-shot prompt, so I need to think with you step-by-step about the entire scope of perhaps one way of describing it would be to create a requirements document as if you were going to give it to a developer, and then from there go and think about what are the no-code tools available to us from Arlo and Zapier and Zaps, and maybe even simpler things like using email and some automations like Zapier, or another even simpler approach of validating with a prototype that uses zero-code, like paper or something, or calling somebody and asking, and having that all be a step-by-step prompt that I can give them to help them do this process, and I need you to think with me about exactly maybe the things I'm not thinking about. What are the space of discussion that I'm not entirely deepening into? Is it about the startup? Is it about technology? Is it about thinking about automations? Is it about thinking about the idea of creating documentation for a product, including requirements documents? I'm not sure what else they need, like mock-ups, requirements documents, commander's intent, et cetera, for them to be able to work on this thing. So do you understand the overall picture? Can you break it down, the discussion that I'm trying to do, and then maybe give me three prompts to take this prompt forward? So not the prompt that I'm going to get at, what are the next two or three prompts that I can do to clarify my idea and to clarify the scale and scope of this project to help you help me best?\n\nChatGPT\nIt sounds like you're looking to develop a series of prompts to guide early-stage founders in creating a simple prototype for their idea using no-code tools. This is a multi-faceted process involving several aspects:\n\nIdentifying the Core Idea: The first step is to help the founders clarify their main idea or problem they're solving. A prompt could ask them to succinctly describe their idea and the key problem it addresses.\nChoosing the Right No-Code Tool: Based on the idea, the next step is to identify the most suitable no-code tool. This involves understanding the capabilities of various tools like Airtable, Zapier, and others. A prompt could ask them to consider the features they need (like database management, automation, etc.) and match these with the features offered by different no-code tools.\nSimplifying the Idea for Prototyping: Often, the first prototype doesn't need all the features of the final product. A prompt could guide them to strip down their idea to the most basic version that can still validate their core hypothesis.\nDocumentation and Planning: Before building, it's crucial to have a clear plan. This includes a requirements document, potential mock-ups, and a clear goal (like what they aim to test or validate with this prototype). A prompt could guide them to outline these elements.\nValidation Approach: Depending on their resources and the nature of the project, the validation approach can vary. It might involve building a digital prototype with no-code tools, or it could be as simple as using paper prototypes or direct customer interviews. A prompt could ask them to consider their validation strategy based on their specific context and resources.\nThese steps can form the basis of your prompts. Would you like to start by focusing on any specific step, or should we develop a prompt for each step?\nUser\nI'd like to create a sort of flowchart for this, where each of them is informing the other and different feedback loops. For instance, you can draw a circle, sort of arrow, that goes back to one state that will be about refining the idea, or refining the prototype, or creating the mockup. And we would like to have that sort of guide the creation of the prompt. So let's start first with making this flowchart.\n\nChatGPT\n\nCreate a flowchart for guiding early-stage startup founders in prototyping a no-code application. The flowchart should have the following steps: 1. Idea Clarification: Start with understanding and defining the core idea. 2. Tool Selection: Choose the right no-code tool based on the project's needs. 3. Prototype Simplification: Simplify the idea for an initial prototype. 4. Documentation and Planning: Prepare a requirements document and mock-ups. 5. Validation Strategy: Decide on the approach for validating the prototype. Include feedback loops where each step can lead back to refining the idea, prototype, or mock-up. Use arrows to show the progression and feedback loops between these steps. The style should be clear and easy to understand, suitable for startup founders with minimal technical background.\nHere's a flowchart that outlines the process for early-stage startup founders to prototype a no-code application. It includes the steps of idea clarification, tool selection, prototype simplification, documentation and planning, and the validation strategy. The flowchart also incorporates feedback loops for refining the idea, prototype, or mock-up.\n\nThis visual guide should help in creating prompts for each step, allowing founders to navigate the process more effectively. Would you like to proceed with developing specific prompts for each step now?\nUser\nCan you make this flowchart using Matplotlib and Python? Or any other more rigorous defined UML, OML type flowcharting language that is open source?\n\nChatGPT\nOutput image\nI've created a flowchart using Matplotlib in Python, which visually represents the process for early-stage startup founders to prototype a no-code application. This flowchart includes the main steps like idea clarification, tool selection, prototype simplification, documentation and planning, and the validation strategy. It also features feedback loops indicating the possibility of returning to earlier steps for refinement.\n\nThis more technical and rigorous approach to flowchart creation can be particularly useful for detailed planning and analysis. Let me know if you need any adjustments or if we should proceed with developing prompts based on this flowchart. ​​\nUser\nCan you please work on creating a chart that will demonstrate the process effectively? The current chart is full of really large drawings that makes it hard to read. Please think step-by-step about our objectives for this chart and how it can help both people see their location in a process as well as us in terms of whether or not each of our prompt projects is working well for that phase. And then find five things that are good about this prompt and then five things that are bad about this chart. Five things that are good about this chart and five things that are bad about this chart. And then find ways of addressing all of the problems with the chart and all of the ways that we can double down on what's working with the chart and then draw the chart again.\n\nChatGPT\nCertainly! Let's analyze the current chart and determine how it can be improved. We'll start by identifying its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths of the Current Chart:\n\nClear Step Labels: Each stage of the process is clearly labeled, making it easy to understand the different phases.\nLogical Flow: The chart presents a logical progression from one step to another, which helps in understanding the process.\nFeedback Loops: The inclusion of feedback loops illustrates the iterative nature of the prototyping process.\nVisual Simplicity: The use of basic shapes and arrows makes the chart easy to follow.\nFocused Content: The chart is focused specifically on the process of prototyping a no-code application, which is beneficial for the target audience.\nWeaknesses of the Current Chart:\n\nSize of Drawings: The elements are quite large, which can be overwhelming and might make the chart less readable.\nLack of Detail: While simplicity is good, the chart might be too basic and lacks detailed guidance for each step.\nNo Indication of Duration or Complexity: The chart doesn’t indicate how long each step might take or its complexity.\nLimited Contextual Information: There's a lack of context or examples for each step, which could be helpful for understanding.\nNo Distinction Between Mandatory and Optional Steps: The chart treats all steps as equal, but some may be more crucial than others.\nImprovements and Focus for the New Chart:\n\nReduce the Size of Elements: Make the elements smaller for better readability and to fit more information.\nAdd More Detail to Each Step: Include brief descriptions or questions that guide the user on what to consider at each stage.\nIndicate Duration or Complexity: Provide hints about the relative time or effort required for each step.\nInclude Examples or Tips: Add contextual notes or examples for clearer understanding.\nDifferentiate Between Core and Supplementary Steps: Highlight which steps are essential and which are optional or advanced.\nNow, I'll create a revised chart incorporating these improvements. Let's focus on making it more informative, concise, and user-friendly.\nOutput image\nHere's the revised flowchart, designed to address the identified weaknesses and enhance the strengths of the previous version:\n\nReduced Size of Elements: The chart's elements are smaller for better readability.\nAdded Detail to Each Step: Each stage now includes a brief description or guiding question.\nIndication of Duration or Complexity: While not quantified, the simpler design suggests a more straightforward process.\nIncluded Examples or Tips: Descriptive texts provide more context for each step.\nDifferentiated Between Core and Supplementary Steps: The design focuses on the essential steps, with feedback loops indicating optional revisits.\nThis improved chart aims to be more informative, concise, and user-friendly, providing clearer guidance for each step in the prototyping process. Let me know if there are any other adjustments you'd like, or if we can proceed with developing specific prompts based on this flowchart. ​​\nUser\nOkay, so now I would like to think through and make a chart as a table view for the same information and then include a column for the prompt so that we can take this table and then update it consistently. Be sure to think step by step here and identify areas that I'm not thinking about. What are my blind spots in assessing the project, the prototyping? How can this table be most helpful for people in the early validation process? So that they can identify their question that they want to test with a rapid prototype early validation. Does it need to also have some way of including the questions to ask? And let's add that to the chart as well. That is all.\n\nChatGPT\nI've created a table that aligns with the flowchart steps for prototyping a no-code application. This table includes four columns:\n\nStep: The main stages in the prototyping process.\nDescription: A brief overview of what each step entails.\nPrompt: Guiding questions to help early-stage founders focus their thoughts and actions at each stage.\nQuestions to Ask: Additional queries to encourage deeper thinking and to identify potential blind spots.\nThis structured approach is designed to help founders systematically progress through the early validation process. It guides them in defining their idea, choosing the right tools, simplifying their prototype, planning their documentation, and devising a validation strategy. The table is also meant to prompt critical thinking at each step, ensuring a thorough and effective prototyping process.\n\nLet me know if this meets your requirements or if there are additional elements you'd like to include or modify in the table. ​​\nUser\nNot exactly. I'd like it to also include the stuff that we have in the chart above, in terms of the different stages and phases, and make a larger table that includes all of this information all at the same time. And give it back to me as a table please\n\nChatGPT\nThe expanded table now includes more detailed information, aligning closely with the structure and content of the flowchart. This table is comprehensive and covers the following columns:\n\nStep: Identifies each stage in the prototyping process.\nDescription: Provides a brief overview of what each step entails.\nFeedback Loop: Offers insights into how each step could loop back for refinement based on feedback or new insights.\nPrompt: Presents guiding questions to assist founders in focusing their thoughts and actions at each stage.\nQuestions to Ask: Encourages deeper thinking and helps identify potential blind spots at each stage.\nThis table is designed to be a thorough guide for founders in the early validation process, helping them to not only progress through each step methodically but also to revisit and refine their approach as needed.\n\nWould you like to download this table, or is there anything else you'd like to adjust or add? ​​\nUser\nYeah, I would like to have all of the contents in one table. So, the elements from the flowchart above, including the states and what it flows next into, as rows, one after the other, with a start and an end, including time it might take. And the prompt, including the subject, needed a big table. And the service key has a table marked down.\n\nChatGPT\nThe comprehensive table consolidates all elements, including the steps from the flowchart, their subsequent stages, estimated time for each step, detailed descriptions, specific prompts for each stage, and questions to consider. This table provides a clear, step-by-step guide for early-stage founders embarking on a no-code prototyping process, along with an iterative feedback loop.\n\nHere's the table in Markdown format, which you can easily copy and use:\n\nmarkdown\nCopy code\n| Step                                     | Next Step                                | Estimated Time                         | Description                                            | Prompt                                                                  | Questions to Ask                                                        |\n|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Idea Clarification                       | Tool Selection                           | 1-2 days                               | Define core idea and problem addressed.                | Describe your idea in a sentence.

Could you go and review the prompting strategies from the prompting.org and other places, and create a set of principles to follow, and let all the prompts that you create come up with 5 pros, 5 cons, and then let us assess the current status of all the prompts.\n\nChatGPT\nBased on the information from various sources, including MIT Sloan Teaching & Learning Technologies, several key principles for crafting effective AI prompts have emerged:\n\nProvide Context: Adding context to your prompts helps AI generate more sophisticated and tailored responses. For example, specifying the role of the responder or the context of the query can significantly influence the outcome.\nBe Specific: Specificity in prompts leads to more targeted and relevant responses. This includes adding details like time frames, locations, or specific aspects of a topic.\nBuilding on the Conversation: AI systems, especially in chat-based interfaces, can remember earlier parts of a conversation, allowing you to build upon previous responses without repeating the context.\nFocus on Problems, Not Just Prompts: As AI systems evolve, the focus might shift from crafting perfect prompts to more effectively defining problems. This approach emphasizes the importance of clearly outlining the problem's scope and boundaries.\nBe Aware of AI Limitations: Despite advancements, AI systems can have flaws, such as factual inaccuracies or biases. It's crucial to critically assess AI-generated content and be aware of these limitations.\nThese principles can be applied to develop prompts for the prototyping process of a no-code application. Each prompt should provide clear context, be specific to the needs of the stage, build on previous information, focus on solving the problem at hand, and be created with an understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations.\n\nBy following these guidelines, prompts can be more effective in guiding early-stage founders through each stage of their project.\nUser\nOkay, so now let's go through the different phases and write the very first prompt that can help teams.\n\nChatGPT\nLet's create the first prompt for each phase of the no-code application prototyping process, using the principles of effective prompting:\n\nIdea Clarification:\nPrompt: \"Describe your project idea in a few sentences. What specific problem does it solve, and who is your target audience?\"\nTool Selection:\nPrompt: \"List the essential features your project requires. Which no-code tools can provide these features? Consider the complexity and scalability of your project.\"\nPrototype Simplification:\nPrompt: \"What is the simplest version of your idea that can be tested? Identify the core functionality that needs to be included in this initial prototype.\"\nDocumentation and Planning:\nPrompt: \"Can you outline the main requirements for your project? Think about creating a basic mock-up or sketch to visualize your idea.\"\nValidation Strategy:\nPrompt: \"What methods will you use to test your prototype? Define the key metrics or feedback you are looking to gather from this testing phase.\"\nEach of these prompts is designed to be specific, provide context, and focus on the problem at hand, ensuring that the responses are targeted and useful for the respective stage of the prototyping process.\nUser\nThank you.\n\nChatGPT\nYou're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance as you work through your project, feel free to ask. Good luck with your no-code application prototyping!\nUser\nYeah, the prompt is actually for the team to use to talk with a large language model to help them do that element. So it's not a prompt to the team, it's a prompt for an MLM to talk back to the team. Think through step by step about our goals, what about the current goals, what didn't work well in them, what works well in them. Come up with five pros and cons, and then address them with a new list of prompts.\n\nChatGPT\nCreating effective prompts for a team to use with a large language model (LLM) involves considering the model's capabilities and limitations. Let's analyze the current approach and develop improved prompts:\n\nCurrent Approach:\n\nPros:\nDirect: The prompts are straightforward, asking for specific information or actions.\nStructured: They follow the logical flow of the prototyping process.\nClear Objectives: Each prompt is aligned with a specific stage in the process.\nEncourages Detail: Prompts ask for detailed information, leading to comprehensive responses.\nBuilds on Previous Information: Each prompt builds upon the information gathered in previous steps.\nCons:\nMay Lack Context: Prompts might not provide enough context for the LLM to generate highly relevant responses.\nOver-Specificity: Some prompts might be too narrow, limiting the LLM's ability to provide diverse insights.\nLimited Exploration: Prompts may not encourage exploration outside of a narrow focus.\nAssumes Familiarity: They presume the team has a clear understanding of each step.\nPotential for Generic Responses: The LLM might provide generic answers without proper guidance.\nRevised Prompts for LLM:\n\nIdea Clarification:\n\"As an expert in identifying market needs, how would you refine this idea [team's idea description] to better address customer pain points?\"\nTool Selection:\n\"Considering the latest no-code tools and their capabilities, which ones would you recommend for a project that involves [specific project features]?\"\nPrototype Simplification:\n\"Given the core features of our project [list core features], what would be the most effective way to simplify this for an initial prototype?\"\nDocumentation and Planning:\n\"Can you suggest a structured approach to document and plan our project, considering [specific project elements]?\"\nValidation Strategy:\n\"What innovative methods or best practices can be applied to validate a prototype like ours, which aims to [team's specific goal]?\"\nThese revised prompts are designed to provide more context, encourage broader exploration, and guide the LLM to generate responses that are tailored, insightful, and directly applicable to the team's specific needs.\nUser\nOkay, that sounds good. I would like the ability to have a prompt to do this very important element of coming up with team-specific goals. And how would that prompt look? Is it a series of prompts? I can imagine that it might require more than one prompt to get at a really clear goal. Perhaps you can think through step-by-step about what would be a type of rapid prototyped goal prompt strategy. Think of the different elements we might need to derive, and then come up with a series of prompts to be sure that we have a very useful goal that will help us answer the rest of the prompts.\n\nChatGPT\nDeveloping a series of prompts to help teams rapidly prototype and clarify their goals involves a step-by-step approach that uncovers different elements of the goal-setting process. Here's a suggested series of prompts:\n\nInitial Goal Exploration:\n\"Identify the primary mission or purpose of your project. What central problem are you aiming to solve?\"\nTarget Audience Identification:\n\"Who is your target audience? Describe their characteristics, needs, and how your project addresses these.\"\nValue Proposition Clarification:\n\"What unique value or benefit does your project offer to the target audience? How does it stand out from existing solutions?\"\nFeasibility Assessment:\n\"Considering your team's resources and constraints, what are the feasible goals for the project in the short and medium term?\"\nSuccess Metrics Definition:\n\"How will you measure the success of your project? Define specific, measurable outcomes or metrics.\"\nAlignment Check:\n\"Do the defined goals align with your team's values and the broader vision of the project? Discuss any potential adjustments needed.\"\nActionable Steps Formulation:\n\"Break down the main goal into actionable steps or milestones. What are the key actions needed to achieve these goals?\"\nBy going through these prompts, a team can develop a clear, actionable, and aligned set of goals for their project. This process ensures that the goals are well-defined, realistic, and measurable, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent stages of the project.\nUser\nOkay, now you are a prompt expert. Please review this list of prompts above, keeping in mind what if it was simple? And go through and make adjustments to the prompt to make sure that we get the highest quality outputs with the fewest number of input prompts. Is it that they should be more numerical? Should they ask someone else to answer a question before filling in the prompts? Should they ask the agent something? Should the ChatGPT teach the user, the participant, how to use large language models by saying, ask me for a list of validation strategies, etc. Or maybe ask me for a comprehensive list of validation strategies in a use case which were met with one of the columns indicating the stage of the team, the timeline available, and resources, etc. And other columns, I'd like you to come up with at least four other columns to ask about. This way, it's not just teaching them by having them fill something in and giving us our goal, it's actually teaching them the prompts at the same time. also, we might need some information about the business. For instance, the scale have they made any revenue do they have a business model, etc. it might help us determine the goals and also determine if there’s something that we should measure and help them determine success and failure, how long they should work on something before quitting and how much effort they should put the prototype\n\nChatGPT\nTo refine the prompts for simplicity and effectiveness, while also educating users about using large language models, here's an adjusted approach:\n\nSimplified Goal Setting:\n\"What is your project's main objective in one sentence?\"\nTarget Audience and Value:\n\"Who will benefit most from your project, and why?\"\nFeasibility and Success Metrics:\n\"What are three key milestones for your project, and how will you measure success at each?\"\nTeaching Prompt Usage:\n\"To get a list of validation strategies tailored to your project, ask me: 'What are validation strategies suitable for a [your project type] with [team stage, timeline, resources]?' Include other aspects like business model, revenue stage, etc.\"\nBusiness Insight Gathering:\n\"Provide brief details about your business model, current revenue (if any), and resources available. This will help tailor the strategy suggestions.\"\nThese prompts are designed to be more straightforward, requiring less input while still yielding high-quality, relevant outputs. They also guide users in interacting with an LLM effectively, teaching them how to ask for specific, detailed information that matches their project's unique context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT can make mistakes.

      "content": "Certainly! Here's a comprehensive summary of our conversation so far:\n\n1. **Initial Request and Discussion:**\n   - You sought assistance in creating prompts to guide early-stage founders in building a prototype for their idea using no-code tools.\n   - The objective was to develop a step-by-step guide, considering aspects like tool selection, simplification for prototyping, documentation, and validation strategy.\n   - You emphasized using Large Language Models (LLMs) for guiding the process and mentioned tools like Airtable and Zapier.\n\n2. **Flowchart Creation:**\n   - To visually represent the process, a flowchart was discussed and created, detailing stages like Idea Clarification, Tool Selection, Prototype Simplification, Documentation and Planning, and Validation Strategy. Feedback loops were included to show the iterative nature of the process.\n\n3. **Flowchart Refinement:**\n   - Upon review, the flowchart was deemed too \"bubbly\" and large, leading to a request for a more effective depiction.\n   - I analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the initial flowchart and created a revised version, focusing on clarity, context, and differentiation between steps.\n\n4. **Development of a Comprehensive Table:**\n   - A table was created to combine elements from the flowchart, including stages, descriptions, prompts, and questions for each stage.\n   - You requested an expanded table to include more details like next steps, estimated time, and feedback loops.\n   - The comprehensive table aimed to be a complete guide for the prototyping process.\n\n5. **Prompt Strategy Discussion:**\n   - We discussed prompt strategies based on guidelines from various sources, emphasizing context, specificity, problem-focus, and awareness of AI limitations.\n   - The aim was to create effective prompts for each stage of the prototype development process.\n\n6. **Creation of Initial Prompts for Each Phase:**\n   - Specific prompts were developed for each phase, designed to be targeted and useful for the respective stages of prototyping.\n\n7. **Revision and Simplification of Prompts:**\n   - You requested a simplification of prompts, focusing on higher quality outputs with fewer inputs. The prompts were revised to be more straightforward and to educate users on interacting with LLMs.\n\n8. **State Diagram Development:**\n   - To further clarify the process, a state diagram was requested. Initially, a circular diagram using NetworkX was created, but you asked for a linear representation with a clear start, end, and feedback loops.\n   - A linear state diagram was then developed, visually representing the process flow from the initial state to the end, with feedback loops back to the start.\n\nMoving forward, the focus is on diving more deeply into the elements of the prompt table and working on creating a better, more effective table. The goal is to ensure that the table and associated resources are as helpful and user-friendly as possible for guiding early-stage founders through the no-code application prototyping process. \n\nPlease let me know which specific elements of the prompt table you'd like to explore or improve further.",

      "content": "The image you've provided appears to be a state diagram for a prototyping process, detailing the various stages involved in using no-code tools for validation. To enhance this diagram, we would focus on streamlining the flow, ensuring clarity in progression from one step to the next, and incorporating feedback loops.\n\nHere's a conceptual description of how the improved diagram would look:\n\n1. **Start with 'Idea Clarification':** This is where every participant should begin, focusing on clearly defining the problem or need their project addresses.\n\n2. **Move to 'Tool Selection':** Based on the clarified idea, the next logical step is to select the appropriate no-code tools that align with the project's requirements.\n\n3. **Proceed to 'Prototype Simplification':** With the tools selected, the focus shifts to creating a simplified version of the product – an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that is sufficient for initial validation efforts.\n\n4. **Next, 'Documentation and Plan':** Documenting the prototype and planning the validation tests is critical. This step should include outlining the validation strategy and identifying key metrics for success.\n\n5. **Then, 'Validation Strategy':** Here, the actual testing takes place. The prototype is put to the test using the planned validation strategy.\n\n6. **Finally, 'Feedback and Iteration':** After testing, the feedback gathered leads to iterations on the prototype. This step should loop back to 'Idea Clarification' to signify the iterative nature of the process.\n\nIn the improved diagram, arrows would show a clear progression from one stage to the next, with a feedback loop from 'Feedback and Iteration' back to 'Idea Clarification'. This loop represents the iterative cycle of prototyping, where learning from one cycle informs the next.\n\nThe diagram would be designed with simplicity in mind, using clean lines and minimal text to ensure it's easy to follow. Each step would be accompanied by a prompt that assists participants in focusing on the task at hand and ensures they are constantly aligning with their core validation questions. \n\nFor example, prompts might be:\n- **Idea Clarification:** \"What core problem does your idea solve?\"\n- **Tool Selection:** \"Which no-code tool best fits your prototype's needs?\"\n- **Prototype Simplification:** \"What is the simplest version of your idea that can be tested?\"\n- **Documentation and Plan:** \"How will you document your prototype's features and planned tests?\"\n- **Validation Strategy:** \"What are your key metrics for a successful validation test?\"\n- **Feedback and Iteration:** \"What did you learn, and how will you apply it to improve your idea?\"\n\nThese prompts are geared towards ensuring that participants not only create a prototype but also align their work with the critical questions that will validate their business hypotheses.",

All rc settings are stored in a dictionary-like variable called matplotlib.rcParams, which is global to the matplotlib package. See matplotlib.rcParams for a full list of configurable rcParams. rcParams can be modified directly, for example:\n\nfrom cycler import cycler\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib as mpl\n\nmpl.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 2\nmpl.rcParams['lines.linestyle'] = '--'\ndata = np.random.randn(50)\nplt.plot(data)\n\ncustomizing\nNote, that in order to change the usual plot color you have to change the prop_cycle property of axes:\n\nmpl.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = cycler(color=['r', 'g', 'b', 'y'])\nplt.plot(data)  # first color is red\n\ncustomizing\nMatplotlib also provides a couple of convenience functions for modifying rc settings. matplotlib.rc can be used to modify multiple settings in a single group at once, using keyword arguments:\n\nmpl.rc('lines', linewidth=4, linestyle='-.')\nplt.plot(data)\n\ncustomizing\nTemporary rc settings\n\nThe matplotlib.rcParams object can also be changed temporarily using the matplotlib.rc_context context manager:\n\nwith mpl.rc_context({'lines.linewidth': 2, 'lines.linestyle': ':'}):\n    plt.plot(data)\n\ncustomizing\nmatplotlib.rc_context can also be used as a decorator to modify the defaults within a function:\n\n@mpl.rc_context({'lines.linewidth': 3, 'lines.linestyle': '-'})\ndef plotting_function():\n    plt.plot(data)\n\nplotting_function()\n\ncustomizing\nmatplotlib.rcdefaults will restore the standard Matplotlib default settings.\n\nThere is some degree of validation when setting the values of rcParams, see matplotlib.rcsetup for details.\n\nUsing style sheets\n\nAnother way to change the visual appearance of plots is to set the rcParams in a so-called style sheet and import that style sheet with matplotlib.style.use. In this way you can switch easily between different styles by simply changing the imported style sheet. A style sheets looks the same as a matplotlibrc file, but in a style sheet you can only set rcParams that are related to the actual style of a plot. Other rcParams, like backend, will be ignored. matplotlibrc files support all rcParams. The rationale behind this is to make style sheets portable between different machines without having to worry about dependencies which might or might not be installed on another machine. For a full list of rcParams see matplotlib.rcParams. For a list of rcParams that are ignored in style sheets see matplotlib.style.use.\n\nThere are a number of pre-defined styles provided by Matplotlib. For example, there's a pre-defined style called \"ggplot\", which emulates the aesthetics of ggplot (a popular plotting package for R). To use this style, add:\n\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\nTo list all available styles, use:\n\nprint(plt.style.available)\n\n['Solarize_Light2', '_classic_test_patch', '_mpl-gallery', '_mpl-gallery-nogrid', 'bmh', 'classic', 'dark_background', 'fast', 'fivethirtyeight', 'ggplot', 'grayscale', 'seaborn-v0_8', 'seaborn-v0_8-bright', 'seaborn-v0_8-colorblind', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark', 'seaborn-v0_8-dark-palette', 'seaborn-v0_8-darkgrid', 'seaborn-v0_8-deep', 'seaborn-v0_8-muted', 'seaborn-v0_8-notebook', 'seaborn-v0_8-paper', 'seaborn-v0_8-pastel', 'seaborn-v0_8-poster', 'seaborn-v0_8-talk', 'seaborn-v0_8-ticks', 'seaborn-v0_8-white', 'seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid', 'tableau-colorblind10']\n\nDefining your own style\n\nYou can create custom styles and use them by calling style.use with the path or URL to the style sheet.\n\nFor example, you might want to create ./images/presentation.mplstyle with the following:\n\naxes.titlesize : 24\naxes.labelsize : 20\nlines.linewidth : 3\nlines.markersize : 10\nxtick.labelsize : 16\nytick.labelsize : 16\n\nThen, when you want to adapt a plot designed for a paper to one that looks good in a presentation, you can just add:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('./images/presentation.mplstyle')\n\nDistributing styles\n\nYou can include style sheets into standard importable Python packages (which can be e.g. distributed on PyPI). If your package is importable as import mypackage, with a mypackage/__init__.py module, and you add a mypackage/presentation.mplstyle style sheet, then it can be used as plt.style.use(\"mypackage.presentation\"). Subpackages (e.g. dotted.package.name) are also supported.\n\nAlternatively, you can make your style known to Matplotlib by placing your <style-name>.mplstyle file into mpl_configdir/stylelib. You can then load your custom style sheet with a call to style.use(<style-name>). By default mpl_configdir should be ~/.config/matplotlib, but you can check where yours is with matplotlib.get_configdir(); you may need to create this directory. You also can change the directory where Matplotlib looks for the stylelib/ folder by setting the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable, see matplotlib configuration and cache directory locations.\n\nNote that a custom style sheet in mpl_configdir/stylelib will override a style sheet defined by Matplotlib if the styles have the same name.\n\nOnce your <style-name>.mplstyle file is in the appropriate mpl_configdir you can specify your style with:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use(<style-name>)\n\nComposing styles\n\nStyle sheets are designed to be composed together. So you can have a style sheet that customizes colors and a separate style sheet that alters element sizes for presentations. These styles can easily be combined by passing a list of styles:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use(['dark_background', 'presentation'])\n\nNote that styles further to the right will overwrite values that are already defined by styles on the left.\n\nTemporary styling\n\nIf you only want to use a style for a specific block of code but don't want to change the global styling, the style package provides a context manager for limiting your changes to a specific scope. To isolate your styling changes, you can write something like the following:\n\nwith plt.style.context('dark_background'):\n    plt.plot(np.sin(np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi)), 'r-o')\nplt.show()\n\ncustomizing\nThe matplotlibrc file\n\nMatplotlib uses matplotlibrc configuration files to customize all kinds of properties, which we call 'rc settings' or 'rc parameters'. You can control the defaults of almost every property in Matplotlib: figure size and DPI, line width, color and style, axes, axis and grid properties, text and font properties and so on. The matplotlibrc is read at startup to configure Matplotlib. Matplotlib looks for matplotlibrc in four locations, in the following order:\n\nmatplotlibrc in the current working directory, usually used for specific customizations that you do not want to apply elsewhere.\n$MATPLOTLIBRC if it is a file, else $MATPLOTLIBRC/matplotlibrc.\nIt next looks in a user-specific place, depending on your platform:\nOn Linux and FreeBSD, it looks in .config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/matplotlib/matplotlibrc) if you've customized your environment.\nOn other platforms, it looks in .matplotlib/matplotlibrc.\nSee matplotlib configuration and cache directory locations.\n\nINSTALL/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc, where INSTALL is something like /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages on Linux, and maybe C:\\Python39\\Lib\\site-packages on Windows. Every time you install matplotlib, this file will be overwritten, so if you want your customizations to be saved, please move this file to your user-specific matplotlib directory.\nOnce a matplotlibrc file has been found, it will not search any of the other paths. When a style sheet is given with style.use('<path>/<style-name>.mplstyle'), settings specified in the style sheet take precedence over settings in the matplotlibrc file.\n\nTo display where the currently active matplotlibrc file was loaded from, one can do the following:\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.matplotlib_fname()\n'/home/foo/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc'\n\nSee below for a sample matplotlibrc file and see matplotlib.rcParams for a full list of configurable rcParams.\n\nThe default matplotlibrc file\n\n#### MATPLOTLIBRC FORMAT\n\n## NOTE FOR END USERS: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!\n##\n## This is a sample Matplotlib configuration file - you can find a copy\n## of it on your system in site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc\n## (relative to your Python installation location).\n## DO NOT EDIT IT!\n##\n## If you wish to change your default style, copy this file to one of the\n## following locations:\n##     Unix/Linux:\n##         $HOME/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc OR\n##         $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/matplotlib/matplotlibrc (if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)\n##     Other platforms:\n##         $HOME/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc\n## and edit that copy.\n##\n## See https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html#customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files\n## for more details on the paths which are checked for the configuration file.\n##\n## Blank lines, or lines starting with a comment symbol, are ignored, as are\n## trailing comments.

The 6 font properties used for font matching are\n## given below with their default values.\n##\n## The font.family property can take either a single or multiple entries of any\n## combination of concrete font names (not supported when rendering text with\n## usetex) or the following five generic values:\n##     - 'serif' (e.g., Times),\n##     - 'sans-serif' (e.g., Helvetica),\n##     - 'cursive' (e.g., Zapf-Chancery),\n##     - 'fantasy' (e.g., Western), and\n##     - 'monospace' (e.g., Courier).\n## Each of these values has a corresponding default list of font names\n## (font.serif, etc.); the first available font in the list is used.  Note that\n## for font.serif, font.sans-serif, and font.monospace, the first element of\n## the list (a DejaVu font) will always be used because DejaVu is shipped with\n## Matplotlib and is thus guaranteed to be available; the other entries are\n## left as examples of other possible values.\n##\n## The font.style property has three values: normal (or roman), italic\n## or oblique.  The oblique style will be used for italic, if it is not\n## present.\n##\n## The font.variant property has two values: normal or small-caps.  For\n## TrueType fonts, which are scalable fonts, small-caps is equivalent\n## to using a font size of 'smaller', or about 83 % of the current font\n## size.\n##\n## The font.weight property has effectively 13 values: normal, bold,\n## bolder, lighter, 100, 200, 300, ..., 900.  Normal is the same as\n## 400, and bold is 700.  bolder and lighter are relative values with\n## respect to the current weight.\n##\n## The font.stretch property has 11 values: ultra-condensed,\n## extra-condensed, condensed, semi-condensed, normal, semi-expanded,\n## expanded, extra-expanded, ultra-expanded, wider, and narrower.  This\n## property is not currently implemented.\n##\n## The font.size property is the default font size for text, given in points.\n## 10 pt is the standard value.\n##\n## Note that font.size controls default text sizes.  To configure\n## special text sizes tick labels, axes, labels, title, etc., see the rc\n## settings for axes and ticks.  Special text sizes can be defined\n## relative to font.size, using the following values: xx-small, x-small,\n## small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large, larger, or smaller\n\n#font.family:  sans-serif\n#font.style:   normal\n#font.variant: normal\n#font.weight:  normal\n#font.stretch: normal\n#font.size:    10.0\n\n#font.serif:      DejaVu Serif, Bitstream Vera Serif, Computer Modern Roman, New Century Schoolbook, Century Schoolbook L, Utopia, ITC Bookman, Bookman, Nimbus Roman No9 L, Times New Roman, Times, Palatino, Charter, serif\n#font.sans-serif: DejaVu Sans, Bitstream Vera Sans, Computer Modern Sans Serif, Lucida Grande, Verdana, Geneva, Lucid, Arial, Helvetica, Avant Garde, sans-serif\n#font.cursive:    Apple Chancery, Textile, Zapf Chancery, Sand, Script MT, Felipa, Comic Neue, Comic Sans MS, cursive\n#font.fantasy:    Chicago, Charcoal, Impact, Western, xkcd script, fantasy\n#font.monospace:  DejaVu Sans Mono, Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, Computer Modern Typewriter, Andale Mono, Nimbus Mono L, Courier New, Courier, Fixed, Terminal, monospace\n\n\n## ***************************************************************************\n## * TEXT                                                                    *\n## ***************************************************************************\n## The text properties used by `text.Text`.\n## See https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/artist_api.html#module-matplotlib.text\n## for more information on text properties\n#text.color: black\n\n## FreeType hinting flag (\"foo\" corresponds to FT_LOAD_FOO); may be one of the\n## following (Proprietary Matplotlib-specific synonyms are given in parentheses,\n## but their use is discouraged):\n## - default: Use the font's native hinter if possible, else FreeType's auto-hinter.\n##            (\"either\" is a synonym).\n## - no_autohint: Use the font's native hinter if possible, else don't hint.\n##                (\"native\" is a synonym.)\n## - force_autohint: Use FreeType's auto-hinter.
