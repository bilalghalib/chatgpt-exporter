      "content": "Jad, we need to prepare for the AI for Impact workshop that Bloom is hosting on July 14-16, 2023. We must update our website and make this new offering free for partners and alumni.\n\nThe workshop will combine learning with collective intelligence gathering. It aims to help us benefit from large language models and other AI tools. These can be used by organizations, nonprofits, social enterprise accelerators, and incubators.\n\nFirstly, we'll run it with our internal team alongside partners and alumni from previous training programs. The website should reflect its exclusivity while keeping a price tag of $99 which would be waived off for qualifying individuals using a reference code.\n\nWe're updating the form too: adding fields asking about their role (to tailor benefits) and what problem they hope to address using AI or any challenge they face. This same reference code would also appear at the bottom of the form.\n\nPlease let me know if you can adjust the HubSpot form yourself; otherwise I’ll take care of it myself.\n\nFinally, we’re creating a platform where people share resources/approaches in an organized manner - think an air table structure on a webpage featuring uploadable knowledge forms as well as grid view showcasing all available resources along with filter-and-sort functionality.\n",

Update information about the workshop, make sure it's clear that it's free for partners and alumni, and set the regular price at $99 for others. Implement a system for applying a reference code to waive this fee for qualifying individuals.\n\n3. **Update the registration form**: Add fields to the form asking about the participant's role and the problem they hope to address using AI or any challenge they face. The reference code should also appear at the bottom of the form. \n\n4. **Adjust the HubSpot form**: If Jad has the capability to adjust the form himself, he should do this. If not, he should inform the other party that they need to do it.\n\n5. **Create a knowledge-sharing platform**: This platform will be a part of the website where participants can share resources/approaches. It should have an air table-like structure with uploadable knowledge forms and a grid view showcasing all available resources. It should also feature filter-and-sort functionality. \n\n6. **Communicate updates**: Once all the above tasks are completed, inform the relevant team members and partners about the updates. \n\nThis list is sequenced in a way that it follows a logical progression and ensures all tasks can be done effectively and efficiently.",
