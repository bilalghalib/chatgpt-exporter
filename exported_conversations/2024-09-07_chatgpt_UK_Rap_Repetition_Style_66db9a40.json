      "content": "The style of British rap you're referring to is called **\"Road Rap\"** or sometimes just **\"UK Rap.\"** It often involves a distinct lyrical style where the artist repeats the last word of a bar to emphasize it. This is a common technique in the UK rap scene, particularly among artists associated with street culture. While it's not exclusive to one subgenre, this technique is more prevalent in Road Rap or Drill, which emphasize gritty, real-life storytelling and hard-hitting delivery.\n\nWould you like to explore examples of this style or artists known for it?",
