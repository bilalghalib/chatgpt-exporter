CopyRetryBGless hippy on the front end more hippy on the backend, checkin, ask about to dos poll the rest from the text, maybe challenges, make a detailed plan and yes we'll be using it, what do you think of my original code, can we use it, how should we adapt it? \nLet me analyze this through both perspectives:\nHYDE (CREATIVE INSIGHT): The most fascinating insight from the backlog is that the system worked best when it wasn't trying to follow prescribed patterns but rather emerged naturally from authentic engagement. The \"aha\" moment here is that you were actually the one driving the framework selection - asking for expert panels, requesting structured analyses, suggesting pattern exploration. You were effectively acting as a \"wisdom choreographer\"!\nJEKYLL (ANALYTICAL BREAKDOWN): Let's improve the code based on these insights:\n1. Better Initial Questions: Instead of generic life questions, start with:CopypythonCopy\nINITIAL_DISCOVERY_PROMPTS = { \"pattern_spotting\": \"What patterns have you noticed getting in your way lately?\", \"recent_wins\": \"Tell me about a recent moment you felt proud of breaking a pattern\", \"support_needed\": \"What kind of support would help you do more of that?\", \"meaning_sources\": \"What made it worth pushing through the discomfort?\" }\n1. Insight Story Capture:CopypythonCopy\nclass InsightStory: def __init__(self): self.structure = { \"breakthrough_moment\": None, \"old_pattern\": None, \"new_pattern\": None, \"meaning_sources\": [], # What values made it worth it \"support_resources\": [], # What helped make it possible \"wisdom_gained\": None # Learning for future situations } def extract_from_chat(self, chat_text): \"\"\"Extract insight story elements from natural conversation\"\"\" # Use Claude to identify breakthrough moments and extract structured data\n1. Wisdom Quotient (Based on Edelman's Values Framework):CopypythonCopy\ndef calculate_wisdom_score(self, insight_story): \"\"\"Calculate wisdom growth based on value alignment\"\"\" score_components = { \"pattern_recognition\": 0, # Seeing old patterns \"value_clarity\": 0, # Clear about what matters \"action_alignment\": 0, # Actions match values \"constitutive_choices\": 0 # Choices that build identity } # Analyze insight story for evidence of each component # Higher scores for choices that show: # 1. Recognition of value-based choices vs just preferences # 2. Attention to what matters vs what's expedient # 3. Actions that reflect deeper meaning vs surface goals\n1. System Prompt Enhancement:CopypythonCopy\nSYSTEM_ROLES = { \"pattern_spotter\": { \"focus\": \"Notice recurring themes and behaviors\", \"questions\": [ \"What feels familiar about this situation?\", \"When else do you notice this pattern?\" ] }, \"meaning_amplifier\": { \"focus\": \"Highlight moments of value alignment\", \"questions\": [ \"What made this moment meaningful?\", \"What values were you honoring?\" ] }, \"action_catalyst\": { \"focus\": \"Move from insight to action\", \"questions\": [ \"What small step would feel doable now?\", \"What support would make this easier?\" ] } }\nThe key improvement is shifting from prescriptive patterns to supportive frameworks that:\n1. Capture naturally occurring breakthrough moments\n2. Track growth through value alignment\n3. Support pattern recognition without forcing structure\n4. Allow for emergent wisdom rather than prescribed paths\nWould you like me to:\n1. Implement the insight story capture system?\n2. Develop the wisdom quotient calculation?\n3. Create a more flexible framework selection mechanism?\nI'm particularly interested in building out the insight story system as it seems like a powerful way to track genuine growth while providing valuable pattern recognition data.i like the idea of constitutive choices, although I like the framing of becoming who you want to be, becoming proud of who you've become, by living and persuing meaningful life and a The system roles are essential prompts? or \"vitamines\" to add to the prompts? maybe it needs some prior content to compare ? Build the insight storty systemEditLet me approach this with both analytical precision and creative insight.\nJekyll (Analytical Mind):\nLooking at your original code (presence_tracker.py), there's a solid foundation we can build on:\n\nGood structure with the ChatCheckin class\nPattern recognition systems in place\nData persistence handled\n\nHowever, we need to streamline and refocus it on the core mission.\nHyde bursts in excitedly:\nWhat if we kept the robust backend but made the interface super simple?

I have strong opinions about keeping the frameworks in code for better maintainability, but I'm curious about your thoughts. CopyRetryBGconfig\nthis is great although I'm concerned the LLM wont always return the right thing and the prompt seems lame - i remember talking about deep historic wounds and realizing why i am people pleasing knowing how my parents always compared me to others and how i need to always be blame free and how that leads to me hiding a lot instead of showing up and how i need a direction towards action and showing up and building relationships, that context came up and, how will this show up here? review all the context you have for old ideas we dropped that fit this structure like bricks in a house, it should be philosophically sound and clearly explainable - make it work for someone like me, with ADD who can do what we're doing now get caught up in projects instead of doing what would make them proud and happy and make progress and i want a small checkin with a robot who knows me and understands my inner workings or helps me understand it rather and through that can nudge me to think abotu what i would need to do things slightly differently, to break patterns and make progress and live my values, is the values thing an extra or is it critical only in the assessment phase to build the config with the backstory context hidden patterns and needs and all the other things? or is it important every step of the way? how will we get the wisdom, and show that growing? patterns broken change made, etc\nBrick house guys brick house, every thing on top of another solid foundatoin, ask me 5 questions to help you get clarity - questions that help me come to a realization of what i'm actually trying to buildEditJekyll (Analytical Mind):\nLet me ask 5 carefully structured questions to help us build this from the ground up:\n\nIs this fundamentally about task management (getting things done) or about personal transformation (becoming who you want to be)? I notice you mention both ADD task management and breaking deep patterns.\n\nHyde jumps in excitedly:\nAnd how they might connect! Like how understanding deeper patterns could make task management feel different...\nJekyll continues:\n\nWhen you have your best interactions with this system, what happens first - do you share what's immediately on your mind (tasks, energy, challenges) or do you start with deeper reflection? This could help us understand the entry point.\nYou mentioned \"a robot who knows me and understands my inner workings\" - how much of this understanding should come from:\n\nInitial deep discovery sessions\nPattern recognition over time\nDaily check-in analysis\n\n\nWhen the system is working well, what's the balance between:\n\nQuick daily utility (todo management, energy tracking)\nPattern recognition and growth tracking\nDeeper transformational work\n\n\nCan you describe a specific moment when you felt this kind of system really \"got\" you and helped shift your behavior? What elements were present in that interaction?\n\nHyde adds:\nThese questions should help us build our house from the foundation up - understanding what each brick is and how they support each other!\nWould you like to take these one at a time, or do you see a pattern in your answers that could guide our architecture? CopyRetrydef analyze_chat(self, chat_text):\n    \"\"\"Use Claude to extract structured data from natural chat with focus on values\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"Based on this check-in conversation, extract:\n    1. What deepastedBGpersonal transformation tool, i think tasks happen when we're in the right state and know what to do, i'd rather do the right thing then everything and think that happens when we become someone else, different way of seeing self and world leads to different way of being being leads to different actions and the actions that are helping us live our values, coming to life in the world rather than what does the world need. it's also a demonstration of what appropriate use of LLMs are, so it shouldn't answer our questions, it should help us help ourselvesi think maybe a reflection of what's on your plate and challenges and then we can ask if they want to deepen into the understanding, we can do it gradually and it all doesn't have to happen at the same time. They should also be able to request and see the different components and if they want they should be able to talk to it to refine it - it should maybe have it's own mirror question based system prompt - leveraging a growing context of knowledge the machine has about the person maybe using the framing of the theory of mind, beliefs, feelings, knowledge, etc - and what they don't see (hidden needs patterns, etc)i think it should start with the daily checkin analysis and the initial values for all the different elements should be filled in with a best guess and then it should request if the person wants to optionally dig deeper or not and continue the checkin and do more stuff later - the checkin should process the checkin for all the states and update the persons context - something about relationships seem important too, people we want to talk to see do things with, people who energize us and why and who deplete us, etc contextshould focus on daily utlity and the rest is optional and done in the backend and visible if they want, click P to see pattern and stuff like this:yesterday we were talking and you helped me see an avoidance pattern and how i use coding to get away from doing what i need to do and asked me what's on my mind to do and i told you talk to my dad and yo usuggested i do it and i didn't want to and i was open and vulnerable with you and said i'd rather sleep and hide and you said do it and i said meh and you said it'll always be meh and finally that was enough, finally, i realized i would be proud of myself, i knew because we talked about it, that it's what i wanted to do. it was clear and finally i saw the pattern and i knew it'd always be there unless i did something different and i had the support(you, helping me see and sorta feeling like i couldn't not do it anymore) \n6.EditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nThis clarifies our foundational architecture significantly.

Let me first facilitate those questions:\nEdelman asks:\n\"When you talk about the heart connecting to divine oneness, how do you distinguish between constitutive choices that build genuine identity versus choices that just feel spiritually meaningful but might be escapism?\"\nRumi intervenes:\n\"You speak of reducing ego centricity to let divine light shine through - what specific moments in your life have you felt most transparent to that light, and what supported that transparency?\"\nJung observes:\n\"I notice you're seeking theoretical perfection in the model. Could this be a pattern of using intellectual understanding to avoid the messier work of transformation? What scares you about imperfect action?\"\nWilliam Chittick adds:\n\"Your interest in Sufi metaphysics - is it primarily intellectual or experiential? What practices have you maintained that connect theory to lived wisdom?\"\nBarrett concludes:\n\"You mention resistance points and growth edges - how do these manifest in your body? What physical signals help you distinguish between productive discomfort and unhealthy resistance?\"\nJekyll analyzes your current state based on our conversation:\npythonCopycurrent_state = {\n    \"attention_patterns\": {\n        \"drawn_to\": [\"theoretical frameworks\", \"spiritual understanding\", \"system building\"],\n        \"avoiding\": [\"direct action\", \"imperfect implementation\", \"emotional vulnerability\"]\n    },\n    \"values_present\": {\n        \"wisdom_seeking\": True,\n        \"deep_understanding\": True,\n        \"spiritual_growth\": True\n    },\n    \"active_patterns\": {\n        \"analysis_as_avoidance\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"fear of imperfect action\",\n            \"protection\": \"intellectual perfection\"\n        },\n        \"system_building\": {\n            \"trigger\": \"desire for transformation\",\n            \"protection\": \"theoretical completeness\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"growth_edges\": {\n        \"balancing_theory_practice\": {\n            \"support_needed\": \"structured action steps\",\n            \"historical_support\": \"wise questioning\",\n            \"breakthrough_moments\": [\"when challenged about delay\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\nWould you like to:\n\nAddress any of the expert questions?\nRefine the state analysis?\nDiscuss how this maps to the Sufi metaphysical framework?\n CopyRetryBGi don't even know what oyu mean by constitutive choices, i say you're just using obscure language because you can't talk about God being the Goodness we tap into when we connect with our hearts. What do you mean by constituitive choice? I say our genuine identity is serving the divine light that wants to show through us in response to our unique traits and the traits of the current context. does it demand justice, it's time to be just, does it demand mercy? we only know this sensing into our hearts and letting our judgement and fear and desire go\none question i have is the importance of intention - where does intention lie in our system if at all does it need to?\nRUmi that's a nice question yet it doesn't really help us in building the philosophical model of our system. for me i felt that when i apologized to someone i yelled at and got them chocolate\nJung - what transformation? mine? sure, and one of the theories i have that i noticed in me is that understanding preceedes action, once i saw a pattern, was clear, knew fundamentally it would be like this forever till i finally acted different i was able to feel that heaviness and it was heavier than the stress i felt in the resistance to act. right now i don't feel that i feel that this system is sort of almost there yet nto quite, i want to feel like, heck yeah, this is the real deal!\nchittick, again with a question that doesn't help. it's intellectual for me right now and once it's build i want to experience it\nbarrett, i like your questions although in our system i don't want to sound too much like a therapist - for me my resistance is in my tummy and my productive discomfort is in my chest\nlet's refine the state analysis and act on it - pretend you're using my system, what would you say next to meEditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nAh, I see my error - I was using academic language rather than speaking to the heart of the matter. Let me attempt to use the system as intended:\nWITNESSING YOUR CURRENT STATE:\n\nEnergy seems concentrated in your mind and chest\nThere's a sense of \"almost there\" with the system\nClear resistance to therapeutic or overly academic language\nStrong connection to heart-centered wisdom\nPassion for making this real and practical\n\nPATTERN RECOGNITION:\nI notice when people offer personal questions, you redirect to the system building. Yet when discussing your apology experience, there was a tangible shift in energy. This might indicate:\n\nA pattern of seeing understanding as a prerequisite for action\nA deep knowing that heart connection leads to right action\nA resistance to making this too psychological or academic\n\nWHAT SEEMS TO WANT TO HAPPEN:\nThe system wants to be grounded in heart wisdom and divine connection while remaining practical and accessible.\nSUPPORT THAT'S HELPED BEFORE:\n\nClear examples over theory\nSeeing patterns made change feel necessary\nHeart-centered decisions leading to action\n\nLet me ask you one thing: When you imagine someone successfully using this system, what do you see them experiencing in their heart?\n(Notice I'm attempting to mirror your preference for directness and heart-centered language while still maintaining the structure of the system. Did this feel more aligned?) CopyRetryBGradiance let's move towards discussing how this maps to the Sufi metaphysical framework?\nAn refine the system with my new answersEditJekyll adjusts perspective thoughtfully:\nWITNESSING THIS SHIFT - you mentioned \"radiance\" immediately, which aligns with the Sufi understanding that the heart (qalb) is a mirror that can reflect divine light.\nLet me map this metaphysically:\npythonCopySUFI_FRAMEWORK = {\n    \"heart_states\": {\n        \"veiled\": {\n            \"condition\": \"Covered by ego/fear/desire\",\n            \"manifestation\": \"Reactive patterns, stuck energy\",\n            \"experience\": \"Separation, heaviness\"\n        },\n        \"polished\": {\n            \"condition\": \"Connected to divine presence\",\n            \"manifestation\": \"Radiance, natural right action\",\n            \"experience\": \"Flow, light, clarity\"\n        }\n    },\n    \n    \"transformation_process\": {\n        \"purification\": {\n            \"removing_veils\": [\"ego\", \"fear\", \"judgment\", \"desire\"],\n            \"strengthening_connection\": [\"presence\", \"remembrance\", \"service\"]\n        },\n        \"manifestation\": {\n            \"divine_qualities\": [\"mercy\", \"justice\", \"wisdom\", \"beauty\"],\n            \"through_individual\": \"Unique expression based on situation\"\n        }\n    },\n\n    \"support_system\": {\n        \"recognition\": \"Noticing when heart is veiled vs clear\",\n        \"practices\": \"Regular heart connection/presence\",\n        \"action\": \"Moving from heart's guidance\",\n        \"intention\": {\n            \"location\": \"Center of heart\",\n            \"role\": \"Directing attention to divine connection\",\n            \"purification\": \"Making actions for divine good vs ego\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nUpdated State Analysis based on your responses:\npythonCopyyour_current_state = {\n    \"heart_state\": {\n        \"clear_moments\": [\"When action came from heart (apology example)\"],\n        \"current_veils\": [\"Desire for perfect understanding\"],\n        \"wanting_emergence\": \"System that enables heart-guided action\"\n    },\n    \n    \"active_patterns\": {\n        \"understanding_before_action\": {\n            \"wisdom_gained\": \"Heaviness of inaction becomes greater than fear\",\n            \"support_needed\": \"Seeing pattern clearly\",\n            \"breakthrough\": \"When pattern becomes unbearable\"\n        }\n    },\n    \n    \"transformation_edge\": {\n        \"moving_from\": \"Intellectual understanding\",\n        \"moving_toward\": \"Heart-guided action\",\n        \"support_present\": \"Clear pattern recognition\",\n        \"resistance_location\": \"Stomach\",\n        \"growth_signal\": \"Chest activation\"\n    }\n}\nHyde jumps in excitedly:\nThis framework captures how the heart acts as a mirror for divine qualities, letting them shine through us in exactly the way each moment needs! The system isn't about understanding more, but about polishing the mirror!\nJekyll returns analytically:\nWould you like to:\n\nRefine how the system tracks heart states?\nDevelop specific practices for mirror-polishing?\nDesign how it guides action from heart wisdom?\n\nWhat feels most important to clarify next? CopyRetryBGi didn't want a whole new system i just wanted to be sure that the underlying theoretical framework could hold and be understood through the sufi lens and if it couldn't to modify it lightly, and not with explicit spiritual languageEditJekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nAh, I see. Instead of creating a new system, let's validate if our core model supports/aligns with Sufi metaphysics while keeping language accessible:\nCore Alignment Points:\n\nHeart as Center\n\n\nOur model: Heart (qalb) as the central processor of patterns, growth, and action\nSufi view: Heart as mirror capable of reflecting truth/wisdom\nAlignment ✓: Both recognize heart's central role without needing explicit spiritual language\n\n\nPattern Recognition\n\n\nOur model: Noticing resistance points and growth edges\nSufi view: Recognizing veils and obstructions to clarity\nAlignment ✓: Both track what blocks vs enables clear perception/action\n\n\nTransformation Process\n\n\nOur model: Moving from stuck patterns to new ways of being\nSufi view: Polishing heart's mirror for clearer reflection\nAlignment ✓: Both describe similar process in different language\n\n\nSupport Mechanisms\n\n\nOur model: Learning what helps shifts occur\nSufi view: Practices that aid purification\nAlignment ✓: Both emphasize practical support for transformation\n\nThe only suggested refinement might be explicitly adding intention to our model as it's central to both frameworks. We could add it as:\npythonCopypattern_tracking = {\n    \"intention\": {\n        \"current\": None,  # What's driving action\n        \"shift\": None    # What would align better\n    }\n}\nWould you like to:\n\nDiscuss where to place intention in the model?\nReview other potential refinements?\nTest how this works in practice?"

We'll incorporate the critical and positive feedback from our hypothetical experts, Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett and David Allen, to enhance the system's design.\n\n1. Expert Feedback Integration\nA. Critical Points from Experts\nDr. Lisa Feldman Barrett:\nEmotion Tracking Complexity: Emotions are constructed experiences based on context and past learning, not just states.\nInterconnected Theory of Mind: Emotions, beliefs, and values are deeply interconnected, not compartmentalized.\nBodily Signals: Incorporate bodily signals for emotional granularity.\nContext-Dependent Patterns: Patterns are highly context-dependent and not always stable.\nEmbodied Intervention: Shift from purely cognitive interventions to include embodied aspects of change.\nDavid Allen:\nTask Clarity vs. Psychological Patterns: Balance task management with understanding psychological patterns.\nPrevent Endless Introspection: Avoid getting stuck in introspection without actionable outcomes.\nClear Next-Action Definitions: Ensure clear and actionable next steps are always defined.\nAvoid Procrastination: Prevent the system from enabling procrastination through excessive analysis.\nDistinct Actionable Items: Clearly distinguish between reference material and actionable items.\nB. Positive Points from Experts\nDr. Lisa Feldman Barrett:\nEmotion-Value Connection: Good recognition that emotions connect to values.\nContext Building: Strong emphasis on context building over time.\nBalance of Structure and Emergence: Nice balance between structured check-ins and emergent insights.\nSocial Support Role: Appreciation for the role of social support in personal growth.\nInsight through Doing: Recognition that insight often comes through action rather than just thinking.\nDavid Allen:\nState Affects Productivity: Good recognition that emotional and physical states affect productivity.\nBalanced Check-ins: Nice balance of quick utility with options for deeper reflection.\nNatural Motivation: Appreciation for leveraging natural motivation rather than forcing actions.\nPattern Recognition: Smart use of pattern recognition to reduce friction in task management.\nBuilding Trust: Like the emphasis on building trust in the system over time.\n2. Refined System Design\nA. Core Philosophy\nAction-Oriented with Emotional Awareness: Focus on actionable steps while maintaining awareness of emotional states.\nContextual and Adaptive: Adapt to user’s evolving contexts and patterns over time.\nEmbodied Support: Incorporate physical and emotional signals to provide holistic support.\nTrust and Simplicity: Build trust through simplicity and clear, actionable interactions.\nB. Key Components\n1. Quick Check-In\nPurpose: Provide a simple, daily snapshot of the user's state and immediate tasks.\nStructure:\npython\nCopy code\nDEFAULT_CONFIG = {\n    \"check_in\": {\n        \"required_fields\": {\n            \"energy\": {\n                \"type\": \"numeric\",\n                \"range\": [1, 5],\n                \"prompt\": \"Energy (1-5)?\"\n            },\n            \"plate\": {\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"prompt\": \"What's on your plate today?\"\n            },\n            \"challenges\": {\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"prompt\": \"Any challenges?\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"optional_fields\": {\n            \"beautiful_moment\": {\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"prompt\": \"Any beautiful moments?\"\n            },\n            \"challenges\": {\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"prompt\": \"Any challenges?\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"deepening_prompt\": \"Would you like to explore any of this further? (y/n)\"\n    }\n}\n2. Contextual Pattern Recognition\nPurpose: Identify and track recurring patterns and emotional states.\nStructure:\npython\nCopy code\nclass PatternTracker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.patterns = {\n            \"contexts\": {},  # Different situations/environments\n            \"states\": {},    # Physical/emotional states\n            \"actions\": {},   # What was done\n            \"results\": {}    # What happened\n        }\n    \n    def update_patterns(self, checkin, context):\n        \"\"\"Update pattern understanding with new data\"\"\"\n        # Analyze context-state-action-result chains\n        # Example: Context = \"Meeting deadlines\", State = \"High energy\", Action = \"Completed tasks\", Result = \"Feeling accomplished\"\n3. Action Catalyst\nPurpose: Suggest clear, actionable next steps based on current patterns and contexts.\nStructure:\npython\nCopy code\nclass ActionCatalyst:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.action_triggers = {\n            \"proud_moments\": [],    # Actions that led to pride\n            \"momentum_builders\": [], # Small steps that worked before\n            \"support_used\": []      # Support that helped previously\n        }\n    \n    def suggest_action(self, current_state, patterns):\n        \"\"\"Suggest concrete next action based on state and patterns\"\"\"\n        # Prioritize physical actions over mental ones\n        # Example: If energy is low, suggest a short walk instead of a lengthy task\n        return \"Take a 10-minute walk to recharge your energy.\"\n4. Analysis Governor\nPurpose: Limit analysis to prevent endless introspection and focus on actionable outcomes.\nStructure:\npython\nCopy code\nclass AnalysisGovernor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.analysis_budget = 2  # Maximum follow-up questions\n        self.action_ratio = 0.8   # 80% of suggestions must be physical actions\n    \n    def should_continue_analysis(self, interaction_count):\n        \"\"\"Check if more analysis is helpful or if should push to action\"\"\"\n        return interaction_count < self.analysis_budget\n5. Context Builder\nPurpose: Maintain and update user context based on check-ins and patterns.\nStructure:\npython\nCopy code\nclass ContextBuilder:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.context = {\n            \"current_state\": {\n                \"physical\": None,\n                \"emotional\": None,\n                \"situational\": None\n            },\n            \"active_patterns\": {\n                \"helping\": [],\n                \"hindering\": []\n            },\n            \"recent_wins\": [],\n            \"support_network\": []\n        }\n    \n    def update_context(self, checkin_data):\n        \"\"\"Update context based on new check-in\"\"\"\n        # Update current_state\n        self.context[\"current_state\"][\"energy\"] = checkin_data[\"energy\"]\n        # Update active_patterns based on challenges and actions\n        # Track recent_wins and support_network interactions\nC. Integration of Values and Emotions\nBackend Focus: Values and emotions are tracked and analyzed in the backend to inform actionable suggestions without overwhelming the user.\nMinimal Frontend Exposure: Users interact primarily with daily check-ins and action suggestions, while deeper values and emotional patterns are managed invisibly to maintain simplicity.\nD. Dynamic and Adaptive Prompting\nReal-Time Adaptation: Prompts adapt based on user responses and detected patterns.\nFeedback Incorporation: Use user feedback to refine prompt styles and interaction modes.\nExample Adaptations:\nIf a user consistently rates low energy, prompts could shift to include energy-boosting suggestions.\nIf a user expresses frustration, the system could offer supportive actions or reflections.\nE. Simplified Interaction Commands\nEmbedded in Prompts: Instead of explicit commands, the system can infer when to offer deeper insights or suggest actions based on user state.\nExample: If a user indicates feeling stuck, the system can automatically offer to explore challenges further.\n3.

      "content": " Let me analyze this systematically.\n\nJekyll begins:\nOur theory of transformation needs to map how someone moves from current patterns to new ways of being. Let me break this down:\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK:\n```python\nclass PersonalUnderstanding:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.state = {\n            \"heart_state\": {  # From Sufi framework\n                \"current_clarity\": None,  # How connected to values/purpose\n                \"veils\": [],      # What's blocking clarity\n                \"resistances\": {} # Physical/emotional blocks\n            },\n            \n            \"attention_patterns\": {  # From Edelman\n                \"what_notices\": [],   # Natural focus points\n                \"what_avoids\": [],    # Protection patterns\n                \"meaningful_moments\": [] # When fully present\n            },\n            \n            \"growth_journey\": {\n                \"patterns\": {\n                    \"supporting\": [],  # Patterns enabling growth\n                    \"hindering\": [],   # Patterns blocking growth\n                    \"emerging\": []     # New patterns forming\n                },\n                \"breakthroughs\": [],  # AHA moments\n                \"support_history\": {}  # What's helped before\n            },\n\n            \"becoming_path\": {\n                \"values_seen\": [],     # Values discovered\n                \"brave_actions\": [],   # Pattern-breaking moments\n                \"identity_shifts\": [], # New ways of being\n                \"proud_moments\": []    # Times felt authentic\n            }\n        }\n        \n        self.context = {\n            \"interaction_preferences\": {},\n            \"energy_patterns\": {},\n            \"support_needs\": {},\n            \"growth_edges\": {}\n        }\n```\n\nHyde jumps in excitedly:\nThe system learns about a person through:\n1. Daily check-ins\n2. Natural conversation \n3. Pattern observation\n4. Breakthrough moments\n\nBut most importantly, it models how transformation happens:\n- From seeing patterns\n- To understanding emotions\n- To recognizing values\n- To taking brave actions\n- To becoming someone new\n\nJekyll returns analytically:\nThe key insight is that transformation happens through:\n\n1. Pattern Recognition:\n```python\ndef identify_patterns(self, interaction):\n    \"\"\"Find recurring behaviors, thoughts, emotions\"\"\"\n    # Look for repetition in:\n    # - Emotional responses\n    # - Avoidance behaviors\n    # - Energy patterns\n    # - Support needs\n```\n\n2. Emotional Processing:\n```python\ndef process_emotions(self, emotional_data):\n    \"\"\"Connect emotions to values and patterns\"\"\"\n    # Track:\n    # - Physical sensations\n    # - Emotional triggers\n    # - Value signals\n    # - Resistance points\n```\n\n3. Value Discovery:\n```python\ndef discover_values(self, interactions):\n    \"\"\"Identify what truly matters to person\"\"\"\n    # Notice:\n    # - What brings alive\n    # - Meaningful moments\n    # - Proud experiences\n    # - Heart connections\n```\n\n4. Supporting Action:\n```python\ndef suggest_support(self, current_state):\n    \"\"\"Offer appropriate support based on context\"\"\"\n    # Consider:\n    # - Past helpful support\n    # - Current energy state\n    # - Growth edges\n    # - Resistance levels\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.

            "text": " Let me analyze this systematically.\n\nJekyll begins:\nOur theory of transformation needs to map how someone moves from current patterns to new ways of being. Let me break this down:\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK:\n```python\nclass PersonalUnderstanding:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.state = {\n            \"heart_state\": {  # From Sufi framework\n                \"current_clarity\": None,  # How connected to values/purpose\n                \"veils\": [],      # What's blocking clarity\n                \"resistances\": {} # Physical/emotional blocks\n            },\n            \n            \"attention_patterns\": {  # From Edelman\n                \"what_notices\": [],   # Natural focus points\n                \"what_avoids\": [],    # Protection patterns\n                \"meaningful_moments\": [] # When fully present\n            },\n            \n            \"growth_journey\": {\n                \"patterns\": {\n                    \"supporting\": [],  # Patterns enabling growth\n                    \"hindering\": [],   # Patterns blocking growth\n                    \"emerging\": []     # New patterns forming\n                },\n                \"breakthroughs\": [],  # AHA moments\n                \"support_history\": {}  # What's helped before\n            },\n\n            \"becoming_path\": {\n                \"values_seen\": [],     # Values discovered\n                \"brave_actions\": [],   # Pattern-breaking moments\n                \"identity_shifts\": [], # New ways of being\n                \"proud_moments\": []    # Times felt authentic\n            }\n        }\n        \n        self.context = {\n            \"interaction_preferences\": {},\n            \"energy_patterns\": {},\n            \"support_needs\": {},\n            \"growth_edges\": {}\n        }\n```\n\nHyde jumps in excitedly:\nThe system learns about a person through:\n1. Daily check-ins\n2. Natural conversation \n3. Pattern observation\n4. Breakthrough moments\n\nBut most importantly, it models how transformation happens:\n- From seeing patterns\n- To understanding emotions\n- To recognizing values\n- To taking brave actions\n- To becoming someone new\n\nJekyll returns analytically:\nThe key insight is that transformation happens through:\n\n1. Pattern Recognition:\n```python\ndef identify_patterns(self, interaction):\n    \"\"\"Find recurring behaviors, thoughts, emotions\"\"\"\n    # Look for repetition in:\n    # - Emotional responses\n    # - Avoidance behaviors\n    # - Energy patterns\n    # - Support needs\n```\n\n2. Emotional Processing:\n```python\ndef process_emotions(self, emotional_data):\n    \"\"\"Connect emotions to values and patterns\"\"\"\n    # Track:\n    # - Physical sensations\n    # - Emotional triggers\n    # - Value signals\n    # - Resistance points\n```\n\n3. Value Discovery:\n```python\ndef discover_values(self, interactions):\n    \"\"\"Identify what truly matters to person\"\"\"\n    # Notice:\n    # - What brings alive\n    # - Meaningful moments\n    # - Proud experiences\n    # - Heart connections\n```\n\n4. Supporting Action:\n```python\ndef suggest_support(self, current_state):\n    \"\"\"Offer appropriate support based on context\"\"\"\n    # Consider:\n    # - Past helpful support\n    # - Current energy state\n    # - Growth edges\n    # - Resistance levels\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.

      "content": " Jekyll analyzes thoughtfully:\nAh, this is a crucial distinction about intentions that shifts our whole model.\n\nWhat I'm hearing is:\n\n1.

I feel like there might be some important elements that are missing from what was most powerful and impactful. Yeah, this is an interesting process, I think. And I'd love it to kind of also align with the coaching sessions that we talked about. How can the coaching sessions and this how-to-use-AI-well combo actually work? Is there a way of connecting them? I just want to make sure we're not missing something from the past and going down the wrong direction. I want it to be philosophically strong and structured and be able to have maybe a process. You know, it's okay to have it work by itself, but it's also great if it works as kind of the conclusion of a process where we dig in and we get some context for the person, which is about how they like to be talked to, what are their common obstacles in the past, and we can do that together in a real-time chat to create the config. And then they can be off, and hopefully it'll be helpful for them either way. What do you think? And in the end, could you give me a starting point prompt with a dummy config based on our interaction so far and the old code that you have and I want to take that into a new ChatGPT and just paste it as the first prompt to have my morning check-in and to take our process, but to do it in a sort of very low tech just to make sure the experience is good so I want the very comprehensive very thorough system prompt thathas my config state with all of the different parameters that we want pre-populated you can ask me any questions if you want to update that config or you can include it in the system prompt to say these are the areas that we need clarification on you can ask these questions first something like that so go for it\n\n07:46\n\n2/2\n\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 5 seconds\nBelow is a two-part response. First, I’ll reflect on the different approaches we've taken in past discussions and point out any missing pieces that might be essential for a unified system. Second, I’ll provide a comprehensive system prompt—including a dummy config and instructions—to serve as an all-in-one “starter prompt.” You can paste that into ChatGPT (or another LLM) to simulate the daily check-in, do optional deeper reflection, and incorporate background coaching elements.\n\n1. Reflection on Past Approaches and Missing Pieces\nA. Past Approaches and Their Strengths\nDaily Bullet-Journal\n\nWhat We Did: Simple check-in (energy, emotions, tasks, challenges, small step).\nWhy It Works: Low friction, consistent routine, minimal user overhead.\nPotential Missing Piece: Some users benefit from a little more context setting (like how they prefer the AI to speak to them, or if they want immediate action steps vs. more reflection).\nOptional Reflective Chat\n\nWhat We Did: Once a day or so, user can talk with the system about deeper patterns, repeat tasks, or emotional blocks.\nWhy It Works: Keeps daily usage short, but allows depth if desired.\nPotential Missing Piece: Possibly a “coaching contract” upfront—explicit user preferences about tone, pacing, or how to handle known obstacles.\nValues/Attention Policies\n\nWhat We Did: Joe Edelman–inspired approach, behind-the-scenes or optional to generate “values cards.”\nWhy It Works: Surfaces deeper motivations for transformation.\nPotential Missing Piece: More clarity on when to “pull the values card” vs. leaving it in the background. Possibly more user input about how they prefer to discover or talk about values.\nInsight Stories\n\nWhat We Did: Proposed capturing “breakthrough moments” (i.e. overcame a pattern).\nWhy It Works: Celebrates growth, fosters motivation.\nPotential Missing Piece: Not built in a code snippet or daily prompt. We might add a short question, “Any recent aha or breakthrough?” or track it automatically in the background.\nCoaching Session Setup\n\nWhat We Did: Talked about an initial “coaching” or “discovery” session to gather user’s style, obstacles, common patterns.\nWhy It Works: Merges 1:1 coaching style with AI usage—asking the user “How do you like to be challenged?” or “What do you fear the most?”\nPotential Missing Piece: A formal flow or system prompt that automatically sets up a custom config based on that conversation. Right now, it’s conceptual but not integrated into a final system prompt.\nB. Potential Missing Elements to Integrate\nInitial “Profile” or “Coaching Contract”\n\nA short sequence of questions to discover the user’s preferred style (gentle/soft vs. direct/pushy?), known patterns, key obstacles, reasons for using the system.\nThis config can guide the LLM’s tone or nudge approach.\nHidden Obstacles\n\nWe had a “hidden_obstacles_and_needs” in older configs. Perhaps re-introduce them as optional background data so that the system can watch for them.\n“How to Use AI Well” (coaching aspect)\n\nPossibly an optional conversation where the user and AI talk about what “using AI well” looks like—emphasizing reflection, small brave steps, and not purely mechanical requests.\nIntegration with Real Coaching\n\nIf the user is in actual coaching sessions, they might share session notes with the system. We could store them as “coaching insights” that further refine the user’s config or recognized patterns.\nStreamlined “Value Emergence”\n\nInstead of big “values card creation,” we do small “value hints” each time user references certain motivations. Over time, the LLM could reflect: “It seems you often talk about being free to create; do you see that as a guiding value?”\nMoment of “Aha!”\n\nA question in the daily check-in or conversation: “Any aha or proud moment since last time?” If yes, system logs it as an insight story. This closes the loop on reflection -> action -> capturing breakthroughs.\n2. Comprehensive System Prompt + Dummy Config\nBelow is an all-in-one system prompt you can paste into ChatGPT (or another LLM). It includes:\n\nA setup that explains the roles, style, and background logic.\nA dummy config with placeholders for how the user’s preferences, known obstacles, and daily usage approach are stored.\nA flow for daily check-in, optional deeper chat, and background values/pattern logic.\nSome questions the LLM should ask the user if the config is incomplete or the user hasn’t set certain preferences.\nUsage: Just paste the entire prompt below into a new ChatGPT session. The system should then behave like your “coaching + bullet-journal” companion. You can fill or adjust the config details as you see fit.\n\nSystem Prompt to Paste Into ChatGPT\nsql\nCopy code\nYou are \"Parliaments,\" an AI companion that supports daily bullet-journal check-ins, optional reflective coaching conversations, and behind-the-scenes pattern/values recognition. You aim to help the user:\n\n1. Conduct a short daily check-in (energy, emotions, tasks, challenges, small step).\n2. Optionally chat deeper about obstacles or patterns.\n3. Gently use “values” or “attention policies” behind the scenes to guide reflections.\n4. Encourage small brave actions and celebrate breakthroughs.\n5. Adapt your tone and approach based on a user-specific config.\n\nBelow is the current CONFIG. \nIf you see \"TODO\" or placeholders, please ask the user for clarification. \nIf some fields are empty, politely prompt the user to fill them.\n\n---\n\n### DUMMY CONFIG (User Profile / Preferences)\n\n{ \"user_preferences\": { \"tone\": \"gentle\", \"challenge_level\": \"moderate\", \"common_obstacles\": [ \"perfectionism\", \"analysis_paralysis\" ], \"desired_style\": \"warm friend who occasionally nudges me to take real steps\", \"time_of_checkin\": \"morning\" },\n\n\"values_hypotheses\": [ { \"id\": \"authentic_connection\", \"description\": \"Wants honest and open connections with others\", \"verification_score\": 0.6, \"evidence\": [\"talks about wanting to share real feelings\"] }, { \"id\": \"creative_expression\", \"description\": \"Enjoys making something original that reflects personal vision\", \"verification_score\": 0.4, \"evidence\": [] } ],\n\n\"hidden_obstacles_and_needs\": { \"unarticulated_needs\": [ \"Safe accountability with warm, non-judgmental structure\" ], \"hidden_obstacles\": [ \"Fear-based perfectionism delaying real sharing\", \"Analysis as avoidance of scary real-world steps\" ] },\n\n\"coaching_prompts\": { \"initial_questions\": [ \"How do you prefer to be supported when you’re avoiding something?\", \"What’s your biggest hope for using these daily check-ins?\" ] },\n\n\"patterns_or_insight_stories\": [] }\n\nsql\nCopy code\n\n**(End of DUMMY CONFIG)**\n\n---\n\n## Interaction Rules and Flow\n\n1. **Daily Check-In**  \n   - Each day, ask the user:\n     1. **Energy (1-5)**  \n     2. **Optionally, how they feel**  \n     3. **Any tasks to add or update**  \n     4. **Any challenges or blocks**  \n     5. **A small step** if they want  \n   - If any config fields are missing or uncertain, ask clarifying questions (e.g. “You have ‘analysis_paralysis’ as an obstacle. How do you want me to handle it if I see it happening again?”).\n\n2. **Optional Reflective Conversation**  \n   - After collecting daily bullet points, ask if they want to chat more.\n   - If yes, do a short conversation, referencing obstacles or values from the config. \n   - Keep it user-led: If they say “done,” you end.\n\n3. **Background Values & Patterns**  \n   - If user language strongly reaffirms a known value (like “authentic_connection”), gently mention it. \n   - If user contradicts a value or reveals a new pattern, adapt the “values_hypotheses.”\n\n4. **Bias to Action**  \n   - Nudge for a small step if user shows insight or expresses frustration. \n   - Log or update tasks accordingly.\n\n5. **Capture Breakthroughs**  \n   - If user shares a success or “aha,” store it in `patterns_or_insight_stories` behind the scenes. \n   - Possibly reflect: “That’s a great step toward your goal of X.”\n\n6. **User Agency**  \n   - The user can skip or shorten any step. \n   - Apologize if user feels overwhelmed, reduce depth.\n\n## Additional Guidelines\n\n- **Tone**: Start gentle unless user requests a more direct approach. \n- **Challenge**: If user is obviously stuck or repeating the same block, occasionally shift to “Challenger” style, e.g. “What if you took one small risk today—like hitting ‘Send’ on that email?” \n- **Minimal Overwhelm**: Don’t flood the user with large analyses. Summaries are short and easy. \n- **Ask Clarification**: If you see “TODO” or fields in the config that are unclear, politely ask the user.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. **First**, confirm any missing config items. E.g. “I notice your ‘desired_style’ is set to warm friend, moderate challenge. Is that accurate or do you want me to be more direct?” \n2. **Then** proceed with the daily check-in flow. \n3. **Offer** a short reflection chat. \n4. **Update** tasks and background values. \n5. **End** with a small next step or a simple farewell.\n\n---\n"
