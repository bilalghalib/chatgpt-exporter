This report synthesizes data from various studies, including the impact of untreated wastewater on the Tigris River and regional health, and introduces an advanced treatment shaft technology designed to significantly enhance water quality. It evaluates the environmental implications of the current scenario, the efficacy of the proposed technology, and its compliance with Iraqi environmental laws, including Law No 27 of 2009 for Protection and Improvement of Environment. The report underscores the necessity of this project in mitigating water pollution, safeguarding public health, and contributing to Iraq's sustainable development.\r\nIntroduction\r\nIraq's struggle with water management, particularly in urban areas like Baghdad's Medical City, necessitates an innovative approach to wastewater treatment. The Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project, with a capacity of 150,000 m3/day average to 183,000 m3/day (maximum) is introduced to address these challenges. This report outlines the project’s objectives, detailing the deployment of cutting-edge vertical treatment shaft technology to improve water quality and meet environmental sustainability goals. Emphasizing legal compliance and socio-economic benefits, the report provides an introduction to the current environmental standards, the legislative framework the project will adhere to, the treatment methodology and its expected impact.\r\nEnvironmental, Social & Financial Impact\r\nWastewater mismanagement poses significant environmental, social, and financial threats. By contaminating natural water bodies and reducing arable land, it endangers human health and wildlife while undermining economic activities reliant on clean water. This project's investment in advanced treatment will yield substantial benefits by averting ecological damage and fostering economic prosperity through cleaner water resources.  \r\nThis process of dumping wastewater into the natural water supply poses hazards not only to human health, but can also have a devastating effect on wildlife, especially for fish and other animals in the water. Harmful substances in water can also get into fields and soil, which results in smaller crop yields for farmers. \r\nThe damage to ecosystems due to excessive wastewater discharges has impacts beyond the environment. Economic impacts, such as pumping waste water without treatment into Dijlah river, will cause losses to the population since river water is used for drinking and manufacturing activities and river banks normally are invested for recreation, commercial and employment opportunities. \r\nIn the economic analysis of this investment, the ecological externalities of the project were monetized, starting from the assumption that the wastewater treatment process is a process that has desired output—treated water. Their estimated value, determined by “shadow prices'', actually represents the avoided damage/costs, i.e., the realized benefit/income for the environment as a result of the removal of pollutants during treatment in the WWTP (Waste Water Treatment Plant).\r\nThe difference between the pollution costs for wastewater and the pollution costs for treated water represents the realized savings in the cost of pollution, i.e., environmental benefits. For example, the suspended particles. The final results of the conducted economic cost-benefit analysis unequivocally indicate the full socio-economic justification for the investment. At the same time, the sensitivity analysis proved that the project is resistant to possible changes in input parameters over time.\r\nCurrent Environmental Status\r\nThe water crisis in Iraq sets a critical backdrop for environmental discussions, as highlighted by H.E. Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference referencing that over the last 40 years water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris have decreased by 30 to 40%. With a marked reduction in river flows pollution concerns at the Medical City site become more and more important to address.\r\nThe aggregated contaminated water from Medical City is seen exiting this sewer into the Tigris river in the image below:  \r\nThis pollution is visible on land, as well as from satellite imagery, indicating the severity of the contamination of the river:\r\n \r\nThe environmental status of Medical City outfall has been well researched by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain, see paper reference number ISSN: 1735-3866 \r\n\r\n\r\nPaper reference number ISSN: 2412-0758. \r\nIn these papers is presented water quality data that indicates that key contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates are present at levels that surpass legal levels set by Iraqi Laws, such as Law No 27 of 2009 for Protection and Improvement of Environment.\r\nThe Iraqi Environmental Protection and Enhancement Law No. 27 for 2009 is the main legal document that outlines the environmental considerations for any project or activity to be carried out in the Country. \r\nAs per the requirements of The Iraqi Environmental protection and Enhancement Law no. 27 for year 2009, our team undertake to fulfill all the requirements such as\r\n1. Conduct an EIA (Environment Impact Analysis) study prior to the commencement of any project activities.\r\n2. Get the prior approval of the Ministry of Environment (MoEn) before starting the project as per articles 10 & 11 of the Law no. 27 for 2009.\r\n3. Provide and implement pollution control measures using clean. technologies, this is to be associated to ensure the proper performance of these control measures, as per article 9 of the same law.\r\n4. Provide tools for measuring the levels of pollutants. Records should be kept and made available to MoEn when needed. If such tools cannot be provided by the establishment, the MoEn performs these measurements, as per article 9 of the same law.\r\n5. Build a database for environmental protection and sustainability, as per article 9 of the same law.\r\n6. Reduce pollution through using renewable energy technologies, as per article 9 of the same law.\r\n7. We also undertake to fulfill the requirements of any other legislation and regulations imposed by the relevant Iraqi government organization for the protection of water resources. [a]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the paper “Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the medical city on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City\", Iraq” written by Abdullah M. Ahmed* and Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani we get the following charts indicating these levels:    \r\nNote: S2 is site two, near Medical City\r\nReference: Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the medical city on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq Abdullah M. Ahmed*, Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani DOI: 10.22124/CJES.2024.7447\r\nFrom the paper “Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River” by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi we find the following charts and data:\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe mean value of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is higher than that of permissible limit of Iraqi river standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReference: Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on WaterQuality of Tigris River  https://doi.org/10.30684/etj.34.3B.8 \r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of global trends and local data, it becomes evident that strategic improvements in wastewater treatment are required. Enhanced treatment methods are essential to not only address the immediate concerns related to Medical City's outfall but also to contribute to the larger objective of mitigating Iraq's water challenges.\r\nTechnology Overview\r\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant introduces to Iraq a patented treatment shaft technology, a vertically integrated system designed to occupy much less space (about 20% the size of a conventional Treatment Plant) while delivering high-quality water treatment. Proven effective in reducing pollutants, this technology is a leap forward in meeting and exceeding WHO and Iraqi water discharge standards.  \r\nWET has two technologies for wastewater treatment that provide two levels of treatment, these are:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Treatment Shaft (TS) technology for primary treatment that provides skimming, settling, screening and disinfection for most of the pollutants for safe discharge to surface water (Figure 1).\r\n2. Dual Treatment Shaft (DTS) technology for providing (in addition to primary treatment) secondary and treasury treatment for municipal wastewater and for effluent water reuse for restricted irrigation (Figure 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n C:\\Documents and Settings\\sghalib\\Desktop\\Shaft 3-D\\contract5-rev4a-water.jpg \r\n\r\n 8-NoBG.png \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Figure 1 – Treatment Shaft                    Figure 2 - Double Treatment Shaft        \r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s an innovative and patented design featuring a vertical Treatment Shaft achieves wastewater treatment objectives at a substantially less area for construction, lower cost than traditional alternatives, while controlling odor and simplifying operations.   The technologies has received many patents in the US, Japan, South Korea and more recently in Iraq.   The Treatment Shaft technology has been proven to treat wastewater discharges and eliminate pollution impact on water resources. \r\nThe vertical Treatment Shaft is a United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) award-winning technology (US EPA PISCES 2006 Award) and listed as an Emerging Technology in the “US EPA Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management” Manual in 2013 (see attachment ***).  This award winning technology involves a comprehensive process that includes pre-treatment, primary and secondary treatment phases, and a final disinfection stage. Each phase is designed to efficiently reduce specific pollutants. Modeling the improvements in water markers for the Medical City site we are confident we can meet, and exceed the WHO and Iraqi legal standards for water discharge quality. \r\nSludge Management and Disposal\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vertical Treatment Shaft, when implemented and in operation, will capture almost all the solids (TSS) and organic contaminants (BOD) from going into the river as it is the case currently.  This will be achieved by the primary treatment in the first shaft and secondary treatment using the DAF system in the second shaft.   Skimming and settled primary solids from the first shaft (estimated to be 1.5% dry solids) will be pumped to the sludge storage/thickening tank. The return activated sludge from the DAF’s (expected to be approximately 3% dry solids) will be diverted from the return activated sludge line from each DAF to the sludge storage/thickening tank. Primary sludge and secondary sludge will be thickened in the sludge storage/thickener tank. The combined thickened sludge will pass through dry solids presses, with the dried solids being deposited by conveyor into either a dump body truck or a roll-off container. The remaining effluent discharges will meet the water TSS and BOD limits as stated in the project objectives. The projected amount of solid to be captured and disposed off site is estimated at 17,200 lbs per day which is equivalent to 132,000 gallons per day which will bring huge improvement to water quality in the river.  Dried solids could be treated using dry bed area and could be used as a fertilizer.  \r\nI suggest to add that the drying beds that are available in Al Rustemiya Plant in Baghdad can be used for the drying of the sludge that comes out of the two vertical treatment shafts in Medical city and Al Zuyut Factory. As currently the plant is not fully operational >\r\n\r\n\r\nI am also suggesting and reminding them that we have offered a discount for the case of awarding the second project.

This includes adherence to historical legislations like Regulation No. (25) of 1967, which underscores Iraq's early initiatives in preserving its water resources. \r\nThe project is a testament to Iraq's enduring and progressive environmental governance. It embodies the principles of historical legislations and aligns with contemporary legal obligations, such as Iraq's commitment to the UN Water Convention, ensuring the project's operations remain within the ambit of national and international environmental mandates.  \r\nOur project prioritizes legal compliance throughout its design and operational phases. We ensure that all aspects of wastewater treatment, from pollutant removal to effluent discharge, adhere to the mandated environmental standards. This commitment extends to regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms, ensuring ongoing compliance and adaptation to any legal updates.\r\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project aligns with Iraq's key environmental laws, especially Law No. 27 of 2009. This project not only improves water quality and public health but also follows Iraq's tradition of environmental protection. By using modern technology and practices, it sets an important example of responsible and legal environmental management. It reflects Iraq's ongoing commitment to both its environmental heritage and current goals for sustainable and excellent environmental practices.\r\nSignificance of the Project:\r\nThe Medical City & Al Zuyut Vertical Waste Treatment Plant project not only addresses contemporary environmental challenges but also resonates with Iraq's historical commitment to environmental legislation. Iraq's early initiatives, like the Regulation No. (25) of 1967, laid the foundation for protecting water resources, a commitment further solidified by joining the UN Water Convention. This project continues that legacy, demonstrating Iraq's dedication to sustainable water management and environmental stewardship.\r\nNow Iraq stands at a pivotal moment to reassert its leadership in environmental legislation and implementation. The project is a testament to innovation in wastewater treatment and a crucial step in keeping Iraqi citizens healthy and safe. By reducing healthcare costs and protecting water resources, the project aligns with Iraq's legal structures, and its commitment to environmental excellence.\r\nCOMPARISON STUDY BETWEEN NEWLY AWARDED TRADITIONAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT (AL KHANSA IN BAGHDAD) BY THE MUNICIPALITY OF BAGHDAD, SEWERAGE DEPARTMENT & THE PROPOSED MEDICAL CITY/AL ZUYUT VERTIzCAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT[c]\r\n1.

This decrease has exacerbated pollution concerns, particularly at the Medical City site. Notably, contamination from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, significantly impacts the Tigris River. Research by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants like biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater from Medical City, surpassing legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\n\n## **Current Environmental Status**\n\nThe water crisis in Iraq sets a critical backdrop for environmental discussions, as highlighted by H.E. Abdul Latif Rashid at the UN Water Conference referencing that over the last 40 years water flows in the Euphrates and Tigris have decreased by 30 to 40%. With a marked reduction in river flows pollution concerns at the Medical City site become more and more important to address.\n\nOf particular significance is the contamination originating from Medical City, evident in both on-land observations and satellite imagery, and notably impacting the Tigris River.\n\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/NSCvVGgcS1wTPfDdxp9-WslDn4ohByYZZe67qXiuA93MgIdNbzoiSSm1oEUkIAFwE52uGKwxGcnXhLwA8ClYraWKVMyjKAOdy7ekQID7xCuC-5sc5tTx-bZingmYgBlhse-M-6-DHWzD)\n\n_Aggregated contaminated water from Medical City is seen exiting into the Tigris River_\n\n_Satellite observations of polluted water emanating from Medical City outfall (dark color)._![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/L2iF-6p6680Um-JZxJMTx4_qZ6zHhkclNp5iQA_Oz1siZkSqQWUvwxYpJHIJk6xQoDNqNakvzdYIAOK1b7og3AndzFuktn1eBbqaJ1aAiZfCpBY-F_1vDqe0MM9wiXJJhmvfmTKoWV5i)\n\n\nResearch conducted by the University of Technology Baghdad and the University of Nahrain, as documented in papers with reference numbers ISSN: 1735-3866 and ISSN: 2412-0758\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/97fxt1I6NigE3FdWph-_q87vH9F32_HlThu6JNKoiNxAKEih1XE8YxOosFqC4CRZhc-ckGO2dIdbQZ4rgs4suFMXTq3jqM6LwiiZQl4p4uUEtBZAUDu9PGIOEk4m8s97-rz-5VKTIt2a)\n\n**_(Number ISSN: 1735-3866)_**\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/4JXcKBTOcyGNtlWRsLUclZ5OgSNzzjlbzY_49-_-Se7LVReKM3hMx5bx4ef8tOo-PIO_03U1CkJfKZx5ElBIX13hzCOyD-uhIqrvw4rFkMk2YDEHFNXGtTPR83x6RUP5FJ5VQYhS97qw)\n\n(Number ISSN: 2412-0758)\n\nIn these papers, it provides substantial evidence of elevated levels of key contaminants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids, ammonia, and phosphates in the wastewater discharged from Medical City. These levels surpass legal limits set by Iraqi laws, including Law No. 27 of 2009 for the Protection and Improvement of Environment.\n\nStudies such as \"Monthly accumulative effect of wastewater discharged from the Medical City on the water quality of Tigris River in Baghdad City, Iraq\" by Abdullah M. Ahmed and Jabbar H. Al-Baidhani, and \"Evaluating the Effects of Medical City Wastewater on Water Quality of Tigris River\" by Dr. Sedik A.K. Al-Hiyaly, Warqa'a N. Ma'alah, and Dr. Mohammed N. AL-Azzawi, further corroborate these findings. Notably, the mean value of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exceeds permissible limits, indicating a severe deterioration in water quality.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/IE5FNGjSD5ocwWRp33pOwDx_rUoNJ97wOEn7aYiCM4QWRXqJ-3YVy_h9OB2Vmidi4_dffnGMV4iI1d5qbshxPVY5WnJOrmH9Tkk8-vvnr2M_SU-OaoQxGEXjYjgJtfnLnHQZN0v2c--S)\n\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/siQxd9eweA0G4UVpRZmFmpKIVGJOVcoH4Wc2tiE59Vy2ByGvfcRbRvHnl3IYAApOkS3zNgxQAscYFvT_NoKKe8IXkjHuje3ezCTM8ygcxE2a7vUJ1tfw4gGcpddiRvcWEOvIcVaB1Qqk)\n\n**Note:** _S2 is site two, at the Medical City outfall_"
