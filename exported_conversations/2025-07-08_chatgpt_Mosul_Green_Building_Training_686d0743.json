The program uses a \"Build-Learn-Sell\" methodology that balances technical skills with business acumen, targeting mixed teams of architects and civil engineers.\n\n## Core Design Principles\n\n### 1. **Climate-First Approach**\n- Every solution addresses 49°C reality\n- Power cuts and moisture as co-challenges  \n- Local materials and methods prioritized\n\n### 2. **Heritage-Modern Bridge**\n- Start with traditional wisdom (courtyards, mashrabiya)\n- Layer modern technology thoughtfully\n- Respect cultural privacy norms\n\n### 3. **Market-Ready Graduates**\n- Trust-building skills emphasized\n- Real supplier relationships developed\n- Employer connections facilitated\n- Portfolio development integrated\n\n### 4. **Peer Learning Model**\n- Mixed architect-engineer teams\n- Rotating roles build complete skillset\n- Knowledge gaps become learning opportunities\n\n## Slide Deck Structure (Per Day)\n\n### Opening Slides (5 slides)\n1. Welcome + Energy starter\n2. Day's mission + outcomes  \n3. Schedule with visual blocks\n4. Team roles for the day\n5. Success metrics\n\n### LEARN Block (15 slides max)\n- Hook: Local problem story (2 slides)\n- Core concept with visuals (5 slides)\n- Technical explanation simplified (4 slides)\n- Local case study (2 slides)\n- Quick knowledge check (2 slides)\n\n### APPLY Block (10 slides)\n- Clear instructions per activity (1 slide each)\n- Visual examples of expected outputs\n- Templates and tools referenced\n- Timer/milestone markers\n- Peer review criteria\n\n### SELL Block (10 slides)\n- Psychology insight (2 slides)\n- Objection → Response matrix (3 slides)\n- Practice scenarios (3 slides)\n- Feedback framework (2 slides)\n\n### Closing Slides (5 slides)\n1. Day's achievements recap\n2. Homework clearly listed\n3. Tomorrow's preview  \n4. Reflection prompt\n5. Social media task\n\n### Total: ~45 slides/day (per stakeholder feedback on avoiding overload)\n\n## Key Slide Features\n\n### Visual Design\n- **High contrast** for projector visibility\n- **Arabic-first** with English subtitles\n- **Local photography** not stock images\n- **Simple infographics** over dense text\n- **QR codes** for resources\n\n### Interactive Elements  \n- **Live polls** for engagement\n- **Timer displays** for activities\n- **Calculation templates** embedded\n- **Video clips** under 30 seconds\n- **Sound cues** for transitions\n\n### Cultural Sensitivity\n- **Gender-neutral** examples\n- **Multi-generational** appeal  \n- **Privacy-conscious** imagery\n- **Local success** stories featured\n- **Religious timing** considered\n\n## Content Priorities by Day\n\n### Day 1: Trust Before Tech\n- Site visits drive everything\n- Personal \"why\" development\n- Team chemistry building\n- Problem validation focus\n\n### Day 2: Touch Before Talk  \n- Materials in hand first\n- Supplier calls = reality check\n- Design through constraints\n- Cost consciousness early\n\n### Day 3: Proof Before Promises\n- Numbers tell the story\n- Simulation as validation\n- ROI drives decisions  \n- Phasing enables action\n\n### Day 4: Practice Before Perfect\n- Real presentations filmed\n- Employer feedback live\n- Iteration in public\n- Confidence through reps\n\n### Day 5: Launch Before Ready\n- Imperfect action valued\n- Network activation\n- Commitment public\n- Support system active\n\n## Critical Success Factors\n\n### Must-Have Slides\n1. **\"My name is...\" personal mission**\n2. **49°C reality check with solutions**\n3. **Good/Better/Best material options**\n4. **ROI calculator template**\n5. **Trust-building script**\n6. **Before/after thermal images**\n7. **Courtyard 8°C benefit proof**\n8. **Generator cost comparison**\n9. **Alumni success stories**\n10. **30-day action roadmap**\n\n### Avoid These Pitfalls\n- Theory-heavy engineering lectures\n- Software tutorials without context\n- Generic sustainability content\n- Expensive-only solutions\n- Individual work emphasis\n- Passive learning formats\n\n## Homework Integration\nEach day's slides end with specific, achievable homework that:\n- Requires leaving the classroom\n- Involves family/community\n- Builds toward final project\n- Creates accountability\n- Generates social proof\n\n## Assessment Approach\n- **No formal tests** - reduces anxiety\n- **Peer scoring** - builds community\n- **Client feedback** - real validation  \n- **Social metrics** - public accountability\n- **Job offers** - ultimate success measure\n\n## Technology Flexibility\nBased on pre-assessment, create three tracks:\n1. **Analog track** - Hand calculations, sketches\n2. **Basic digital** - Excel, simple tools\n3. **Advanced** - Rhino, Ladybug, Revit\n\nAll tracks converge on same outcomes.\n\n## Final Recommendations\n\n### For Slide Development\n1. **Collaborate with local trainers** for cultural nuance\n2. **Test with recent graduates** before launch\n3. **Build in flexibility** for participant needs\n4. **Document everything** for iteration\n5. **Create trainer notes** in Arabic\n\n### For Maximum Impact\n- Start each day with energy and end with reflection\n- Make every example Mosul-specific\n- Celebrate small wins publicly\n- Connect learning to earning immediately\n- Build tribe, not just skills\n\nThis approach synthesizes all stakeholder input into a practical, culturally-sensitive, market-oriented training that transforms graduates into confident practitioners ready for Mosul's unique challenges.Looking at all the stakeholder feedback, transcript, and materials, I'll extract the key ideas and create three distinct approaches for the 5-day training program.Based on reviewing all 133 stakeholder insights, the Arabic transcript with Fatima, and the training materials, I've created a comprehensive plan with:\n\n## 1. **Overview Document with 3 Approaches**\n- **Heritage-First**: Starting with traditional wisdom, gradually adding technology\n- **Problem-Solution Sprint**: Rapid iteration through real client challenges  \n- **Future Builders**: Career-focused with embedded technical skills\n- **Recommended Hybrid**: \"Build-Learn-Sell Bootcamp\" combining the best elements\n\n## 2. **Detailed 5-Day Plan**\nStructured with:\n- 8am-1pm schedule (to avoid extreme heat)\n- Learn (60min) → Apply (90min) → Sell (60min) blocks\n- Mixed architect-engineer teams with rotating roles\n- Day 1 site visits to old city and river houses\n- Progressive complexity from basic comfort to complete proposals\n- Daily social media outputs for market awareness\n\n## 3. **Comprehensive Participant Workbook**\nOperationalizes all activities with:\n- Pre-training skills assessment\n- Daily observation sheets and calculation templates\n- Client empathy maps and ROI worksheets\n- Networking tracker and 30-day action plan\n- Reflection prompts and commitment framework\n\n## 4. **Slide Deck Overview**\nBest practices including:\n- Maximum 45 slides/day (per feedback on avoiding overload)\n- Arabic-first with visual emphasis\n- Local stories and examples throughout\n- Interactive elements and practical templates\n- Three technology tracks for different skill levels\n\n## Key Innovations from Stakeholder Feedback:\n- **Moisture/dampness** solutions added (high priority issue)\n- **Trust-building scripts** for market credibility\n- **Supplier speed-dating** for real connections\n- **Micro-courtyard designs** for small 30m² plots  \n- **Project management** basics for architects\n- **Generator cost comparisons** as primary motivator\n- **Alumni WhatsApp** for ongoing support\n\nThe plan addresses all major concerns raised: extreme heat adaptation, heritage preservation, practical skills gaps, market trust barriers, and career development needs. It maintains the 50/50 theory-practice balance while ensuring graduates leave market-ready with real connections and a clear implementation path.",

By walking participants “from **Bill-of-Quantities (BOQ) to Return-on-Investment (ROI)**” they first *size and cost* a green solution, then *prove its value*, and finally *sell it* to clients who care about comfort, culture and cash-flow. Each day follows the same rhythm—**LEARN → APPLY → SELL → HOMEWORK**—so teams leave with real calculations, market contacts, and a 30-day action plan, not just theory.\n\n| Day | Tagline & Core Focus | **LEARN** <br> (Key concepts) | **APPLY** <br> (Hands-on work) | **SELL** <br> (Market / soft-skills) | **HOMEWORK** <br> (Out-of-class deliverable) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **1** | **Trust Before Tech** <br>Problems & Principles, Courtyards & Climate | *49 °C reality check* • Climate-first principles • Courtyard cooling basics • Personal mission (“My name is…”) | Old-city & river-house site walk • Size a 3×3 m courtyard (≥4 °C drop) | Trust-building scripts • Client empathy map | Visit suppliers, collect datasheets + prices, start BOQ sheet |\n| **2** | **Touch Before Talk** <br>Materials & Methods | Local materials vs moisture • Thermal mass vs insulation • Supplier ecosystem | Supplier speed-dating calls • Physical mock-ups • ROI calc for partial façade upgrade | Cost-conscious pitch framers | Complete BOQ (units, sizes, prices) + photos |\n| **3** | **Proof Before Promises** <br>Digital Modeling & Simulation | Ladybug-Rhino intro • Cooling-load targets (-30 %) • Glazing ratio trade-offs | Run before/after simulations • Produce heat-map GIFs • Attach cost layer to BIM | Storytelling for social (TikTok/IG) | Export visuals + data for ROI deck |\n| **4** | **Practice Before Perfect** <br>Costing & Refinement | Comparative BOQ • Generator cost vs efficiency • Project-management basics | Build full comparative BOQ • Refine design • Negotiation role-play | Value-prop deck • Objection-response matrix | Finalise ROI calculator & record 1-min pitch video |\n| **5** | **Launch Before Ready** <br>Design Sprint & Pitch Day | Presentation craft • Network activation • Support systems | 5-hour design sprint • Employer/Jury feedback • Prototype demos | Public commitment • Alumni WhatsApp launch | 30-day action roadmap + first client touchpoint |\n| **+30 d** | **Competition Day** (optional) | — | Teams present built prototypes & measured savings | Judges award seed projects | Submit post-occupancy data for showcase |\n\n**How to use this table**\n\n1. **Share** it ahead of time so partners grasp the day-by-day flow at a glance.  \n2. **Print** it as a one-pager for trainees to track progress and see the BOQ → ROI journey.  \n3. **Adapt** the homework column for local constraints (e.g., supplier availability, site-visit permissions).  \n\nWith this structure, every slide, activity, and metric ladders up to one promise: *graduates can demonstrate and defend the financial, cultural, and climatic value of heritage-informed green design in Mosul*.",

Architecture all. Graduates early in their players\n\n00:11:41 FATIMA EYAD\n.Ok؟ كلش دا يعني الوطن أهم شيء الدمج ما بين مدني بالمعمارية مثل ما قلتلك إنه المدني، هو متخصص بالماتيريا من البناء، أكثر معماري، ما كلش يتدخل، أوكي، عنده معلومات عامة خلينا نقول بس بالتطبيق العملي والإكسبيرينس، لأ، المدني أكثر إم آ، ليش سألتك هذا السؤال؟ لأنه يعني هذا راح تشوفه أكثر، إنتاج من الناس إللي متخرجين من جامعة الموصل وجامعة الموصل، المستهدفين، مو إم طلاب من جامعة الموصل، يعني إي يعني أو حتى إذا\n\n00:12:10 Bilal\nهي بالموصل، فأكثرياتهم راح يكونوا متخرجين من. من؟ من؟\n\n00:12:16 FATIMA EYAD\n.لأنه كقسم عمارة أو أركيتكشر بس

صح؟ هو تعريف عام كمهندس مدني، بس مو كلهم، يعني أنا طبعا ليش غاية هذا السؤال؟ حتى أشرح لك سوري، يعني تخربطت الأفكار، يا ابني ما يخالف بس آ هاهاها لغاية السؤال، لأنه هاي المعلومات عن المدينة القديمة وتفاصيل البيت القديم، إحنا كمعمري دارسينها يعني دارسينها نظري بالكلية إي إنه البيت القديم مت. كورت متكون من إيوان متكون من كذا طريقة بناء كذا. مو أك يعني غالبا مو أك، يعني مو كلنا ااا صادفت إنه رحنا

بعد\n\n00:15:32 Bilal\n.يا. يا إلا. ب ال ال. الفكرة التدريب، إنها تكون م يعني من ثمانية ل12 لو لأ من الثمانية\n\n00:15:39 FATIMA EYAD\n.إي، أوكي؟ يوم الزيارة، مثلا، إذا أنت نازل للقديمة، فيفضل اليوم تكون بيدك تبلش من وقت يعني الساعة 8:00 مثلا ينطلقون من بيت التراث ويروحون ويرجعون قبل العشرة أو الإداعش. إحنا\n\n00:15:55 Bilal\n.نلتقي هناك أول وبعدين نرجع على بيز التراث حتى ما يصير عنا مواصلتين

فالخصوصية عن خصوصية صار مختلف هناك، باعتبار إنه النهر، ومسافة بعيدة، فأوكي فتحوا بالكن، يزعل نهر\n\n00:19:00 Bilal\nفهاي يعني بالنسبة ال آه خصوصية، و يعني ما ما الناس بالموصل آه ما يخالف لإنه هو البع

قبلها نسوي ال ما متأكد، بس دا أشوف ال\n\n00:21:41 FATIMA EYAD\n.تمام، لا لا تسوي قبلها إي آ، لأنه البناء إنه التعبير، التعبير إيش جاي يصير بوجه حتى يعرفون إش لون شنو بوجه يستخدموها إي\n\n00:21:53 Bilal\n.صح، فدا أحس إنه دي ثري أفضل يكون الم ال وبعدين؟ نحركها هيك، وخلي نمسح هذا. زين، فهذا هسه صار زيت وهسه صار، فالفكرة إنه يعرفون الناس والاحتياجات، وبعدين يبدؤون يعرفون إيش لون، يعني يقدرون يتحكمون بالمواد وبال. حتى يعني يحلون هذول المشاكل إللي آ إللي لقوها بأول يوم، وبعدين السيميوليتن هذا حتى يصير ال يعني ال المواد أسعارهم راح يعرفوها هنا، وبعدين راح يعرفون شكد راح يرجع لهم الفلوس، فهذا الفكرة مال وكاستس، الفكرة إنه نحنا راح يبدؤون يعرفون شلون يقدرون يقو يعني يبيعوها، وآخر يوم يتجمعون كل هدول الأشياء يسوون آه يحاولون يعني مثل ما إذا يبيعون بيت لشخص، اللي عند الإحتياج اللي حسوا بيها بأول يوم، فهذا ال ال\n\n00:23:02 FATIMA EYAD\nشنو يعني ما بعد ال بريسينتاشن؟ شو رح يصير؟\n\n00:23:09 Bilal\n.إنقطع شماسك بعد البعد ال البريزنتيشن ال رح يكون عندهم يجوز 30 يوم ما متأكد، بس يعني مدة إلى

ترشيحة، نغير بالتفكير بال بالمجتمع شوي، فكل كل يوم أخوه سوشيال ميديا أو بوت، فالفكرة بالديزاين كومبوسيشن وكلهم عندهم مثل. They did بهذا ال30 يوم\n\n00:24:53 FATIMA EYAD\nيعني ممكن أقول فيه آ تصفية، يعني تصفيتين، راح يصير أول شي بعد الست أيام راح نختار 3 مشاريع، وهذول 3 مشاريع راح تختاروها، راح يتأهلون، بعدين تشوف يعني عدهم شهر زمان، إم آ يشتغلون ويطورونهم مشروعهم أو فكرتهم، شنو راح تصير بعدها؟\n\n00:25:09 Bilal\n.إي؟ بس ما أعرف إذا بس نختار ال3 بس آ ديبنز على إش إش قد ناس و هذا واحد من الأسئلة إم هسة، عندي فكرة إنه أريدهم يصيرون جروبات. ويعني. يعني يجوز أربع أشخاص يشتغلون مع بعض، واحد يكون مثل يركز على. واحد يركز على ال الديزاين، واحد يركز على والكاست و يعني كلهم يشتغلون مع بعض على المشروع، لو تتوقعين كلهم لازم

      "content": "The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.",

      "content": "### Executive Recommendation  \nYour interviews (especially with Wifaq and Fatima) surface a single north-star: **“Build graduates who can prove, price and sell heritage-smart cooling before the next 49 °C summer.”**  \nTo hit that, keep the **BOQ → ROI** concept but tighten the choreography so every hour ladders toward four outcomes:\n\n| # | Outcome | Evidence of success |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | **Comfort science mastered** | teams predict & measure ≥ 4 °C courtyard drop on site |\n| 2 | **Cost & ROI fluency** | complete comparative BOQ + 3-yr pay-back sheet |\n| 3 | **Trust-building pitch** | 90-second video that blends logic + emotion + Iraqi social proof |\n| 4 | **Market connection** | at least one employer or supplier follow-up scheduled by Day 5 |\n\nEverything below reverse-engineers the week to guarantee those four proof-points.\n\n---\n\n## A. Program Architecture (5 days + Day-30 contest)\n\n| Day | Morning **LEARN** (≤ 45 min bursts) | Mid-day **APPLY** (hands-on) | Late **SELL / REFLECT** | Output |\n|-----|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| **1 – Care before Code**<br>Client, site & ladder safety | Courtyard physics, generator cost math | Old-city & river-front walk (8-10 am) → IR-gun scans, empathy maps | Trust-script micro-pitch | Team charter + “pain-price” grid |\n| **2 – Materials That Talk Money** | Moisture + thermal-mass demo, myth-busting big glass | Supplier speed-dating, cardboard courtyard models, ROI sheet | “Status vs Comfort” duel | Supplier quotes + finished BOQ skeleton |\n| **3 – Digital Proof, Analog Options** | Ladybug-Rhino toggle, Good/Better/Best wall sandwich | Run sims, export GIFs & CSV; manual analog track mirrors calc sheet | Social-media storyboard clinic | Heat-map GIF + cost-layered BIM csv |\n| **4 – From Numbers to Negotiation** | Comparative BOQ, generator cost swap, intro to project management | Build full BOQ, refine designs, negotiation role-play (cost vs quality) | Logic-Emotion-Trust video draft, peer 🔥 test | Ready-to-send Client & Boss decks |\n| **5 – Launch Day** | Green-loan snapshot, career pathways, competition brief | 5-hr sprint to polish design & decks; live jury of employers & suppliers | Lightning pitches + speed-interviews | Signed 30-day action plan + WhatsApp alumni launch |\n| **+ 30 d – Design Competition** | — | Teams present built prototypes & measured ΔT / ROI | Judges (city, suppliers, NGOs) award seed funds | Post-occupancy data + media coverage |\n\n*Rationale:* the field visit happens **Day 1 AM** (when energy is highest and heat still tolerable) and feeds straight into empathy and cost math. Digital proof waits until Day 3 so analog-only participants build confidence first.  \n(Reference to the existing Day 1-5 “Learn–Apply–Sell” rhythm in your deck fileciteturn0file1)\n\n---\n\n## B. Structural Enhancements\n\n| Gap from interviews | Fix | Where it slots |\n|----------------------|-----|---------------|\n| No real site visits | 8-10 am Day 1 bus loop (Beit Turath → river front → UNESCO house) | Day 1 Learn & Apply |\n| Trust-building missing | 20-min “Logic-Emotion-Trust” scaffold + role-play each afternoon | Days 2-5 Sell |\n| Industry bridge weak | Employer “challenge briefs” collected pre-week; jurors + speed-interviews Day 5 | Pre-week + Day 5 |\n| Tech inequity | Three parallel tracks: Analog (calc sheet), Basic Digital (Excel), Advanced (Rhino) – converge on same KPIs | Days 3-4 |\n| Cognitive overload | Max 45-min theory; energiser every 90 min; homework capped at 2 tasks/night | All days |\n| Mentorship void | Telegram + WhatsApp alumni group launched Day 5; weekly mentor office-hours (Weeks 1–4) | Post-week |\n| Missing finance/subsidy info | 10-slide mini-deck on Iraqi green-loan schemes; include in Boss deck template | Day 4 Learn |\n\n---\n\n## C. Operating Playbook\n\n### 1. Team Mechanics  \n* Four-person squads (Designer, Calculator, Documenter, Presenter) rotate roles daily – keeps civil & architecture skill-share balanced (per Fatima’s civil-vs-arch note).  \n* First 30 min of Day 1 used for skills scan + team forming.  \n\n### 2. Resource Kit  \n* **Trainer pack:** 40 local datasheets, price lists, subsidy forms, sample BOQs, unit-conversion cheatsheet.  \n* **Demo kit per station:** IR gun, smoke tower, foam/cork/Isocam samples, 4 pre-configured Rhino laptops, courtyard ROI Excel.  \n* **Logistics:** One 25-seat bus on stand-by 7 : 30 am; iced water boxes; hi-vis vests.\n\n### 3. Assessment (no exams)  \n| Day | Success metric | Evidence |\n|-----|----------------|----------|\n| 1 | Pain articulated | Empathy map screenshot |\n| 2 | Supplier engagement | WhatsApp message proof & quote |\n| 3 | ≥ 30 % load cut | Ladybug CSV delta or analog sheet |\n| 4 | Complete BOQ | Peer-checked spreadsheet |\n| 5 | External validation | ≥ 1 employer follow-up / jury score ≥ 70 % |\n\n### 4. Trainer Roles  \nLead technical, lead business (sales), rotating daily guest (alumni, craftsperson, finance, employer). End-of-day 15-min debrief to tweak pacing.\n\n### 5. Cultural & Gender Lens  \n* Arabic-first slides with English subtitles; all math sheets bilingual.  \n* Privacy, prayer-time and gender-neutral imagery checked slide-by-slide.  \n* Women success stories Day 2 opening; female juror compulsory Day 5.\n\n---\n\n## D. Risk & Mitigation\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|------------|\n| 45 °C+ heat drains energy | High | 8 am–1 pm schedule; shaded site tours; re-hydrate breaks |\n| Tech failure (Rhino) | Med | Four demo laptops + cloud-PC; analog sheets always parallel |\n| No-show suppliers | Med | Pre-signed MoU; backup list; virtual calls |\n| Employer apathy | Low-Med | Invite them to set Day 5 judging criteria; promise CV pack |\n\n---\n\n## E. Success Metrics (Program Level)\n\n* 70 % of graduates complete all four proof-points.  \n* ≥ 5 supplier or employer MoUs signed by Day 30.  \n* ΔT and ROI data from at least 3 prototypes published online within 45 days.  \n* 90 % of alumni active in WhatsApp at 3-month check.  \n\n---\n\n### Why this works\n\n1. **Site-first** → empathy + real temperatures anchor the week.  \n2. **BOQ-→-ROI thread** runs daily; money talk never waits for “later”.  \n3. **Trust scripting** turns shy graduates into believable advisors.  \n4. **Industry presence** on Day 5 collapses the training-to-job time-lag.  \n5. **30-day runway** after the bootcamp converts learning into a measurable built prototype before enthusiasm fades.\n\n**Next actions**\n\n1. Lock site-visit permits with Yamama and Ayoub by **T-3 weeks**.  \n2. Finalise supplier + employer guest list; send challenge briefs by **T-2 weeks**.  \n3. Print trainer packs & prepare demo kits by **T-1 week**.  \n4. Dry-run Day 3 Rhino track on all four laptops (or cloud PC) by **T-2 days**.\n\nWith these adjustments the program moves from a rich—but slightly overloaded—slide deck to a **deliverable pipeline** where every lesson pays off in comfort degrees, dinars saved, and recruiter phone calls.",

      "content": "Review this response and make your own \"reverse engineered\" idea - you can extract quotable quotes, case studies with in depth numbers and walk us through them, and training and facilitation methods from the interviews attached here, we will use that to develop the faciltiation guide and speaker notes - think about what we might need in terms of structure, outline of days, learn apply sell homework and find elements to fill it out [[[Below is a deeply reasoned and designed strategy for a 5-day plus 6th-day design competition architecture for the Green Mosul Training Program for junior architects, focusing on Module 3: Green Architecture & Heritage-Inspired Design – From BOQ to ROI. This recommendation integrates the provided information, addresses feedback from interviews and insight summaries, and builds on the current structure’s strengths while closing identified gaps. The strategy is tailored to Mosul’s context, the needs of junior architects (civil and architectural graduates early in their careers), and the goal of preparing them for practical, market-ready solutions.\n\n---\n\n## **Overview of the Recommended Strategy**\n\nThe training program spans five days of intensive learning, hands-on application, and market-focused skill-building, culminating in a design competition on the sixth day (held 30 days later). Each day follows a structured **Learn**, **Apply**, and **Sell** rhythm to balance theory, practice, and communication skills. The program targets 20-25 junior architects, organized into groups of 4-5 with rotating roles (e.g., Designer, Calculator, Documenter, Presenter) to foster collaboration and versatility.\n\n### **Key Objectives**\n- Equip participants with technical skills (e.g., sizing courtyards, calculating U-values, running simulations) and soft skills (e.g., pitching, trust-building, negotiation).\n- Bridge classroom learning to real-world application through site visits, industry connections, and mentorship.\n- Deliver tangible outcomes: a portfolio-ready design, a network of contacts, and confidence to implement green solutions in Mosul.\n\n### **Addressing Current Gaps**\nThe strategy incorporates feedback to enhance the current structure:\n- **Real Site Visits**: Day 2 includes visits to Old Mosul and riverfront homes.\n- **Skill Absorption**: Hands-on practice is spread across days with post-training support.\n- **Industry Connections**: Suppliers and employers are integrated throughout.\n- **Pitch Practice**: Dedicated sessions with role-playing and feedback.\n- **Trust-Building**: A module on client psychology and cultural sensitivity.\n- **Documentation**: Training on drawings, specifications, and BOQs.\n- **Lifecycle Costing**: Tools and examples for total cost analysis.\n- **Financing/Subsidies**: Information on green loans and incentives.\n- **Neighborhood Scale**: Group projects explore community-level design.\n- **Mentorship**: A 30-day post-training plan with online support.\n\n---\n\n## **Revised 5-Day + 6th-Day Structure**\n\n### **Day 1: Understanding Problems & Heritage Basics**\n**Objective**: Ground participants in Mosul’s climate challenges and client needs while building empathy and foundational knowledge.\n\n- **Learn (60 min)**  \n  - **Lecture**: Mosul’s twin pains (49 °C summer heat, winter dampness) and heritage solutions (courtyards, stack-ventilation).  \n  - **Activity**: Analyze photos of traditional homes; calculate generator costs (e.g., 600,000 IQD/month).  \n  - **Guest**: Alumni shares a success story (e.g., Fatima’s rebuild).  \n\n- **Apply (60 min)**  \n  - **Site Visit Prep**: Form teams (4-5 members), assign roles, and distribute IR guns and cameras.  \n  - **Hands-On**: Draft an empathy map for a client profile (e.g., Ahmed’s family) using sample thermal data.  \n  - **Output**: Client pain points documented (e.g., “hot roofs disrupt sleep”).  \n\n- **Sell (45 min)**  \n  - **Workshop**: Introduction to trust-building and client psychology (e.g., addressing skepticism about “new tech”).  \n  - **Activity**: Draft a 1-minute hook video script (Problem → Proof → Ask).  \n  - **Output**: Rough video script and empathy map.  \n\n- **Homework**: Visit a material supplier, collect datasheets/prices, and photograph one heat-pain point (e.g., a sun-baked roof).\n\n---\n\n### **Day 2: Materials & Methods**\n**Objective**: Master material selection and passive design techniques through real-world exposure and modeling.\n\n- **Learn (60 min)**  \n  - **Field Visit (8:00-10:00 AM)**: Tour Old Mosul and riverfront homes (via Beit Turath Al Musul and Yamama Salih’s coordination).

employers attend Day 5 pitches, closing the employment bridge gap.\n- **Mentorship**: A 30-day plan with mentor check-ins via WhatsApp/Telegram ensures ongoing support.\n\n### **Skill Development**\n- **Pitching**: Daily practice (e.g., pitch duels, lightning pitches) with feedback builds confidence and addresses insufficient practice.\n- **Documentation**: BOQs, drawings, and decks are taught and practiced, filling the documentation skills gap.\n- **Lifecycle Costing**: Day 4 introduces tools to compare initial costs (Green: $1,000, Non-Green: $750) with operating costs (Green: $400, Non-Green: $2,000 over 10 years).\n\n### **Market Relevance**\n- **Financing**: Day 4’s guest speaker and handouts cover subsidies and loans, empowering participants to pitch viable solutions.\n- **Neighborhood Focus**: Day 4’s group work encourages urban-scale thinking, moving beyond individual plots.\n- **Trust-Building**: Day 1 and Day 5 emphasize client empathy and cultural sensitivity, tackling a critical market barrier.\n\n---\n\n## **Supporting Elements**\n\n### **Pre-Training**\n- **Preparation**: Share supplier lists, material datasheets, and software tutorials via WhatsApp.\n- **Tech Check**: Test Rhino/Ladybug on 4 demo laptops; offer cloud backups for accessibility.\n\n### **Post-Training**\n- **30-Day Plan**:  \n  - **Week 1**: Audit a house, share heat-pain photos.  \n  - **Week 2**: Run a simulation, post heat-maps.  \n  - **Week 3**: Pitch to a peer, refine hook.  \n  - **Week 4**: Demo to peers, gather ROI questions.  \n- **Support**: Weekly mentor Q&A sessions online; best projects featured on social media.\n\n### **Resources**\n- **Physical**: IR guns, material samples (foam, cork, Isocam), measuring tools.  \n- **Digital**: BOQ templates, ROI spreadsheets, sample decks.  \n\n---\n\n## **Why This Strategy Works**\n\nThis approach transforms junior architects into market-ready professionals by:\n- **Grounding Learning in Mosul’s Reality**: Site visits and local examples ensure relevance.\n- **Balancing Skills**: Technical (design, costing), practical (models, simulations), and soft (pitching, networking) skills are interwoven.\n- **Building a Network**: Connections with suppliers, employers, and peers provide a career launchpad.\n- **Delivering Value**: Participants leave with a portfolio, a competition entry, and actionable next steps.\n\nBy addressing all identified gaps—site visits, industry ties, pitch practice, trust-building, documentation, lifecycle costing, financing, neighborhood focus, and mentorship—this strategy equips participants to tackle Mosul’s heat crisis with heritage-inspired, green solutions while launching their careers.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Recommendation**\n\nImplement this 5-day plus 6th-day structure to create a transformative training experience. It ensures junior architects gain the skills, confidence, and connections needed to design and sell sustainable homes in Mosul, honoring its heritage while meeting modern demands. Start with pre-training outreach to suppliers and employers, secure site visit permits early, and maintain momentum with post-training support to maximize impact.]]]",

      "content": "The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.",
