Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup - Identified Challenges and Opportunities\nThis section outlines the challenges and opportunities that emerged during the Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup. \n6.1 Challenges\nLack of Commitment in Training Programs\nIssue: One of the significant challenges identified during the meetings was the lack of commitment from participants in training programs. Many individuals attend training sessions primarily for financial incentives rather than a genuine interest in learning or applying the skills.\nImpact: This behavior undermines the effectiveness of the training programs and poses a risk to the long-term success of the BEIT project. If participants are not truly engaged, they are less likely to apply the knowledge and skills gained, which could hinder the project’s objectives.\nConsideration: Developing strategies to increase commitment, such as offering certifications, creating pathways to employment, or enhancing the perceived value of the training, will be crucial in addressing this challenge.\nTechnical and Logistical Difficulties\nIssue: The implementation of sustainable energy solutions, such as solar panels and thermal insulation, presents technical and logistical challenges. These include the availability of materials, the need for specialized skills, and the complexity of integrating these solutions into existing structures.\nImpact: Without addressing these technical challenges, the project risks delays, increased costs, and potential failure to meet sustainability goals.\nConsideration: Collaboration with technical experts and suppliers, as well as piloting these solutions on a small scale, could help in identifying and overcoming these obstacles before full-scale implementation.\nExternal Environmental Factors\nIssue: The project must navigate complex external factors, including legislative and cultural challenges, which could impact the implementation of sustainable practices. For example, existing regulations may not fully support the adoption of new technologies or sustainable building practices.\nConsideration: Identify and share environmental policies and the current efforts to incorporate more green and sustainable policies into the construction industry. We also can incorporate policy and mindset awareness into the curriculum.\n6.2 Opportunities\nIntegration of Local Heritage Practices\nOpportunity: The rich cultural heritage of Mosul offers unique opportunities to integrate traditional building practices into modern sustainability efforts. Practices such as using materials that do not absorb much heat and designing structures that promote natural cooling can be adapted and modernized for current reconstruction projects.\nPotential Impact: By leveraging these traditional practices, the BEIT project can create sustainable solutions that are culturally resonant and environmentally sound. This approach also fosters local pride and ownership, which can enhance community engagement and support for the project.\nExpansion of Entrepreneurship and Innovation\nOpportunity: The focus on entrepreneurship and innovation, particularly through partnerships with organizations like 51 Labs and QAF Labs, presents a significant opportunity to foster economic growth and resilience in Mosul. By supporting the development of new businesses and innovative projects related to sustainable reconstruction, the BEIT project can create a lasting impact on the local economy.\nPotential Impact: Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation can lead to the creation of jobs, the development of new industries, and the overall revitalization of Mosul’s economy. This aligns with the BEIT project’s goals of fostering sustainable and inclusive development.\nCommunity Engagement and Ownership\nOpportunity: The project has the potential to engage the local community in meaningful ways, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility for the sustainable reconstruction of Mosul. Initiatives such as the user-generated content strategy discussed with Mosul Space can play a key role in this.\nPotential Impact: When the community is actively involved in the project, they are more likely to support and sustain the efforts beyond the initial implementation phase. This can lead to long-term success and the replication of sustainable practices across the region.\nLeveraging Government and International Partnerships\nOpportunity: The involvement of government bodies and international organizations offers opportunities to secure the necessary regulatory support and resources for the project. These partnerships can also provide access to expertise, funding, and global best practices in sustainable reconstruction.\nPotential Impact: Strong partnerships with government and international organizations can help overcome regulatory challenges, ensure the project aligns with broader development goals, and enhance the overall impact of the BEIT project.\n6.3 Recommendations and Requests\n• Providing further programming for those who want to innovate new ideas\n• Connect learning and entrepreneurial training programs with the 200 model homes to be built as a pilot program. It can provide early funds and a track record of success for new businesses.\n• Deepen the relationship with the University of Mosul to identify final year projects and the students that might benefit from BEIT initiatives\n• Work with Dr. Basim from the University of Mosul to align our training with the locally relevant certification system he is developing and utilize it as part of our pre/post training assessment.\n• Inverted classrooms and using the \"city as a school\" to move youth from desk and rote learning to engagement with the city and a sense of contribution.\n• I recommend considering the training a part of a multi-part campaign starting with awareness, moving into training to identify paths, and sustaining with periodic events/activities across the ecosystem.\n• How can we collaborate with Lafarge, they are launching an online training in sustainable construction at the end of September.\n• Compiling a list of sustainability challenges needing solutions might be a good next step for both the training as well as the entrepreneurship track. We already started a list during the session.\n• Compiling a list of sustainability solutions we can \"import\" from international best practices is a good complement to the challenges. Question: Where can we host this?\n• Collaborate with training partners who can connect teams with internships(Qaf?) and continued technical training(Mosul Space).\n• Add an early “awareness” campaign with partners on social media to start creating awareness of sustainability challenges in Iraq.\n\n\n7. Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup - Summary of Sustainability Practices and Curriculum Insights\nThis section delves into the specific sustainability practices observed and discussed during the mission, emphasizing how these practices can be integrated into the BEIT project to support sustainable reconstruction efforts in Mosul.\n7.1 Integration of Heritage and Modern Sustainability Practices\nTraditional Building Techniques\nObservation: During the meetings with Dr Basim from the University of Mosul, the Mosul Heritage Foundation, and local architects, several traditional building techniques were highlighted. These include the use of shanasheel (traditional window coverings) that allow light in while blocking direct sunlight, and the design of buildings to promote natural ventilation and cooling.\nApplication: These techniques can be used as inspiration for novel innovations modernizing the approaches into local projects that can reduce the reliance on energy-intensive cooling systems. Using these traditional methods as an anchor to compare/contrast the various elements of the sustainability curriculum will ensure that participants understand the value of heritage in sustainable development, helping them find local inspiration in their heritage while learning the fundamentals of sustainable construction.\nUse of Local Materials\nObservation: The use of locally sourced materials, such as those that do not absorb much heat, was a recurring theme in discussions. This practice not only supports the local economy but also aligns with sustainability principles by reducing the carbon footprint associated with transporting materials.\nApplication: The BEIT project can emphasize the use of local materials in its training programs, encouraging participants to source materials from within their communities. This approach will not only promote sustainability but also foster economic resilience in Mosul.\nRecycling and Reuse of Materials\nObservation: The idea of recycling construction rubble and other waste materials into new building components was discussed extensively, particularly during the Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup. This practice is crucial in a post-conflict context where resources may be limited.\n7.2 Energy Solutions and Efficiency\nSolar Energy\nObservation: Solar energy was identified as a focus for sustainable reconstruction in Mosul. The discussions during the mission emphasized both the benefits and challenges of implementing solar energy solutions, such as the need for proper design and maintenance. \nChallenges: Doubts about its cost-effectiveness when considering battery replacement came up, as well as concerns about dust and the cleaning of panels.\nApplication: Incorporating energy audits, including an analysis of solar energy training into its curriculum, will ensure that participants gain the technical skills needed to assess the appropriateness and cost effectiveness of a solar installation. \nThermal Insulation\nObservation: The importance of thermal insulation in reducing energy consumption was highlighted, particularly in the context of Mosul’s hot climate. Proper insulation techniques can significantly reduce the need for air conditioning, thus lowering energy use. The recommendation is to take inspiration from the thick walls of the heritage buildings, incorporating airgaps using ceramic jugs - yet leveraging modern materials and new types of plaster insulation that can have a similar insulating value and remain very thin.\nApplication: Thermal insulation will be a core topic in the BEIT training programs. Participants will learn about various insulation materials and techniques that can be used in the construction of sustainable housing.\n7.3 Community-Led Sustainability Initiatives\nEngagement through User-Generated Content\nObservation: The success of using user-generated content (UGC) to engage the community in sustainability initiatives was discussed with Abdullah from Mosul Space. This approach has proven effective in other projects and could be a powerful tool in promoting sustainable practices in Mosul.\nEducation and Awareness Campaigns\nObservation: Raising awareness about sustainability and educating the community on best practices was a recurring theme throughout the mission. Participants emphasized the need for ongoing education to ensure the long-term success of sustainability initiatives.\nApplication: The BEIT project will develop education and awareness campaigns, including the use of social media, as part of its broader strategy. These campaigns will target different segments of the population, including youth, women, and marginalized groups, to ensure that everyone is informed and involved in the reconstruction efforts.\n7.3 Curriculum Design Insights\nMindset – we repeatedly heard the most important thing to train people on in terms of sustainable reconstruction is to develop a sustainability mindset\nExperience and practical application > route learning\nPart of the problem was the importing of outside standards in construction. Suggesting that a good approach is to find local standards and solutions.\nThere is a large demand for solar installation experience and a low supply of trainings\nDue to the \"lost time\" during the occupation, many young people are excited to learn and grow.\nIt’s best to bring together diverse people into the trainings, not only people who have studied sustainability or engineers. \nChallenges and Solution Recommendations\n\nChallenges: \nPotential lack of commitment to training programs. This was suggested as a result of prior programs paying participants to attend training programs to meet quotas, potentially with poor selection criteria.\n\nSuggested solution:\nNon-paid program. A larger funnel from the awareness campaign to the invitation to selection. Work with highly motivated participants. Conduct an interview-based selection process. Utilizing this process would require a training partner to have the social media reach and competency for rigorous selection processes. \n\nChallenges: \nPeople's time is limited. This concern was brought up during the meetup. \nSuggested solution:\nThe curriculum might benefit from being time-flexible. The curriculum could also operate on “flipped classroom” principles, where the sessions are pre-recorded and participants come to the training center for questions, to work on projects, and to connect with each other. \n\nChallenges: \nMost learning is rote in Iraq, and engagement is low.\nSuggested solution:\nHave the training program be experiential and practical. Allow participants to model the energy flow and costs of their homes, measure heat maps with thermal cameras of heritage buildings in contrast to modern homes, and create thermal charts of their city to identify the impact landscape (water, trees, height, etc) has on temperature.  \n\n7.4 Curriculum Monitoring and Evaluation\nOne of the interviews conducted while in Mosul was with Dr. Basim from the University of Mosul. During the interview and the Sustainability Meetup, Dr. Basim presented the Green Zuggarat Rating System he and his colleagues are developing. \n\nA current proposition is to use this rubric as a template for our curriculum development and to develop an pre/post test assessment for the items below.\n\nGZRS Rating Categories\n\nCategory\nPercentage\nSite sustainability\n10%\nWater efficiency\n28%\nEnergy efficiency\n30%\nMaterials and resources\n12%\nIndoor environmental quality\n12%\nInnovation\n3%\nRegional relevance\n5%\nTotal\n100%\n\n\n\n\n8.

This includes stakeholders such as Rawanga Organization, 51 Labs, Mosul Space, Mosul Heritage Foundation, and QAF Labs.\nPurpose: These follow-up interactions will help solidify partnerships, address any concerns, and identify specific areas where stakeholders can contribute to the project’s success.\n8.2 Curriculum Development and Validation\nAggregation of Insights for Curriculum Development\nAction: Aggregate the insights gathered from stakeholder meetings and the Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup into an initial draft of the curriculum.\nRecommendation: Maryam at Qaf Labs as well as Hardy from the Iraq Green Building Council both could offer valuable insights into developing the curriculum, as well as could be the implementers of the curriculum. My recommendation is to develop the first draft of the curriculum and then to work collaboratively with the implementation partners to refine it and increase ownership of the content, benefitting from their expertise.\nDraft document: Insights Report From Stakeholder Mapping and Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup\nValidation of Curriculum with Stakeholders\nAction: Organize a validation session with key stakeholders to review the proposed curriculum and gather feedback. This session will involve representatives from the organizations and individuals engaged during the mission. This session can be held in person in Iraq, mid-October could be a good date for this session.\nPurpose: The validation session will ensure that the curriculum is relevant, practical, and aligned with the goals of the BEIT project. It will also provide an opportunity to make any necessary adjustments before the curriculum is finalized.\nOpportunity: It is possible to use the days after the validation session as a collaborative design session with partners with relevant skills, such as the Iraq Green Building Council Team, Maryam from Qaf, and others.\n8.3 Planning for the Next Visit\nScheduling the Next Mission\nAction: Plan and schedule the next mission to Mosul, focusing on the implementation and validation of the training curriculum. This visit will include further stakeholder engagement and site visits. \nTimeline: The next mission should be scheduled within 1-2 months, allowing sufficient time for preparation and coordination with stakeholders.\n9.

Import Necessary Libraries**\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\n### **B. Load Data**\n\n```python\n# Load data from CSV files\nstakeholders = pd.read_csv('Stakeholders.csv')\nengagement_methods = pd.read_csv('EngagementMethods.csv')\nstakeholder_types = pd.read_csv('StakeholderTypes.csv')\nkey_themes = pd.read_csv('KeyThemes.csv')\nparticipant_demographics = pd.read_csv('ParticipantDemographics.csv')\ngeographic_distribution = pd.read_csv('GeographicDistribution.csv')\n```\n\n### **C. Generate Visuals**\n\n#### **1. Pie Chart of Stakeholder Types**\n\n```python\n# Pie Chart of Stakeholder Types\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\nplt.pie(stakeholder_types['Count'], labels=stakeholder_types['Type'], autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)\nplt.title('Distribution of Stakeholders by Type')\nplt.axis('equal')\nplt.savefig('stakeholder_types_pie_chart.png')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n#### **2. Bar Graph of Engagement Methods**\n\n```python\n# Bar Graph of Engagement Methods\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\nplt.bar(engagement_methods['EngagementMethod'], engagement_methods['Count'], color='skyblue')\nplt.title('Engagement Methods Used')\nplt.xlabel('Engagement Method')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Times Used')\nplt.savefig('engagement_methods_bar_graph.png')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n#### **3. Bar Graph of Key Themes Frequency**\n\n```python\n# Bar Graph of Key Themes Frequency\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.barh(key_themes['KeyTheme'], key_themes['Frequency'], color='green')\nplt.title('Frequency of Key Themes Mentioned by Stakeholders')\nplt.xlabel('Frequency')\nplt.ylabel('Key Themes')\nplt.savefig('key_themes_bar_graph.png')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n#### **4.

Timeline of Engagement Activities**\n\nSince we don't have exact dates for each engagement, we'll assume hypothetical dates based on the months mentioned.\n\n```python\n# Create a dataframe for engagement activities\nengagement_activities = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Date': ['July', 'August', 'September', 'October'],\n    'Number of Engagements': [5, 10, 4, 3]\n})\n\n# Line Graph of Engagement Activities Over Time\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\nplt.plot(engagement_activities['Date'], engagement_activities['Number of Engagements'], marker='o', linestyle='-')\nplt.title('Timeline of Engagement Activities')\nplt.xlabel('Month')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Engagements')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.savefig('engagement_timeline_line_graph.png')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n#### **7. Network Diagram of Stakeholder Relationships**\n\nCreating a network diagram requires more complex data. For simplicity, let's assume we have data on collaborations between stakeholders.\n\n**Assumed Collaborations:**\n\n- Mosul Space collaborates with University of Mosul and Beit Turath Mosul.\n- Rwanga Foundation collaborates with 51 Labs and Suli Innovation House.\n- Lafarge Iraq collaborates with Iraq Green Building Council and Sika.\n- KESK collaborates with Hayder Alsamarrae and Sika.\n\n**Create Edge List for Network Diagram**\n\n```python\n# Edge list of collaborations\nedge_list = pd.DataFrame({\n    'From': ['Mosul Space', 'Mosul Space', 'Rwanga Foundation', 'Rwanga Foundation', 'Lafarge Iraq', 'Lafarge Iraq', 'KESK', 'KESK'],\n    'To': ['University of Mosul', 'Beit Turath Mosul', '51 Labs', 'Suli Innovation House', 'Iraq Green Building Council', 'Sika', 'Hayder Alsamarrae', 'Sika']\n})\n```\n\n**Generate Network Diagram using NetworkX**\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Create a graph\nG = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(edge_list, 'From', 'To')\n\n# Draw the graph\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.5)\nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=2000, font_size=10, font_weight='bold', edge_color='gray')\nplt.title('Stakeholder Collaboration Network')\nplt.savefig('stakeholder_network.png')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Step 4: Provide Code and Instructions**\n\n**Note:** Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas matplotlib networkx\n```\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Save the CSV files provided into your working directory.\n2. Copy the Python scripts into a `.py` file or Jupyter notebook.\n3. Run the scripts to generate the visuals.\n4. The images will be saved in the working directory with the filenames specified in `plt.savefig()`.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Integrate Visuals into the Report**\n\nAfter generating the visuals, you can include them in the report at appropriate sections.\n\n- **Figure 1: Distribution of Stakeholders by Type** (Pie Chart)\n  - Place in the section discussing stakeholder types.\n  \n- **Figure 2: Engagement Methods Used** (Bar Graph)\n  - Include in the methodology or engagement methods section.\n\n- **Figure 3: Frequency of Key Themes Mentioned by Stakeholders** (Horizontal Bar Graph)\n  - Place in the key insights section.\n\n- **Figure 4: Participant Demographics at Sustainability and Reconstruction Meetup** (Pie Chart)\n  - Include in the section discussing the meetup.\n\n- **Figure 5: Geographic Distribution of Stakeholders** (Bar Graph)\n  - Place in the section on stakeholder distribution.\n\n- **Figure 6: Timeline of Engagement Activities** (Line Graph)\n  - Include in the methodology or engagement approach section.\n\n- **Figure 7: Stakeholder Collaboration Network** (Network Diagram)\n  - Place in the partnership development efforts section.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Remarks**\n\nBy extracting quantitative data from the content, organizing it into tables, and using Python scripts to generate visuals, we can enhance the report's readability and provide clear illustrations of the stakeholder engagement process and outcomes.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance or adjustments!",

      "content": "Certainly! For the **Partner Identification Report**, we can create several charts to visualize the assessment of potential partners based on the evaluation criteria. Here's how we'll proceed:\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Identify Necessary Charts**\n\n### **A. Radar Chart (Spider Chart)**\n\n- **Purpose**: To compare potential partners across multiple evaluation criteria in a single visualization.\n- **Chart**: Radar Chart showing scores for each partner on different criteria.\n\n### **B. Bar Charts**\n\n- **Purpose**: To compare partners on individual criteria or overall scores.\n- **Charts**:\n  - Bar Chart of Overall Scores for each partner.\n  - Bar Charts for each criterion comparing all partners.\n\n### **C. Heatmap**\n\n- **Purpose**: To visualize the assessment scores in a matrix format, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.\n- **Chart**: Heatmap of partners vs. criteria scores.\n\n### **D. Evaluation Matrix Table**\n\n- **Purpose**: A table summarizing the scores and qualitative assessments for each partner.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Prepare Data for Visualizations**\n\n### **A. Define Evaluation Criteria**\n\nBased on the report, the evaluation criteria are:\n\n1. **Organizational Capacity**\n2. **Experience in Similar Projects**\n3. **Alignment with Program Goals**\n4. **Ability to Reach and Engage Target Audience**\n5. **Strengths**\n6. **Weaknesses**\n\nFor quantitative analysis, we'll assign numerical scores to the first four criteria, and provide qualitative notes for strengths and weaknesses.\n\n### **B.

Import Necessary Libraries**\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom math import pi\nimport seaborn as sns\n```\n\n### **B. Load Data**\n\n```python\n# Load data from CSV files\nevaluation = pd.read_csv('PartnerEvaluation.csv')\nstrengths_weaknesses = pd.read_csv('PartnerStrengthsWeaknesses.csv')\n```\n\n### **C. Generate Visuals**\n\n#### **1. Radar Chart (Spider Chart)**\n\nWe'll create a radar chart to compare the partners across the evaluation criteria.\n\n```python\n# Function to create radar chart\ndef create_radar_chart(df, categories, partner_names):\n    N = len(categories)\n    angles = [n / float(N) * 2 * pi for n in range(N)]\n    angles += angles[:1]\n    \n    plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\n    ax = plt.subplot(111, polar=True)\n    \n    for index, row in df.iterrows():\n        values = row[categories].values.flatten().tolist()\n        values += values[:1]\n        ax.plot(angles, values, linewidth=1, linestyle='solid', label=row['Partner'])\n        ax.fill(angles, values, alpha=0.1)\n    \n    # Add labels\n    plt.xticks(angles[:-1], categories)\n    ax.set_rlabel_position(30)\n    plt.yticks([1,2,3,4,5], [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\"], color=\"grey\", size=7)\n    plt.ylim(0,5)\n    \n    plt.legend(loc='upper right', bbox_to_anchor=(1.1, 1.1))\n    plt.title('Partner Evaluation Radar Chart')\n    plt.savefig('partner_evaluation_radar_chart.png')\n    plt.show()\n\n# Prepare data\ncategories = ['OrganizationalCapacity', 'ExperienceInSimilarProjects', 'AlignmentWithProgramGoals', 'AbilityToReachTargetAudience']\npartner_names = evaluation['Partner'].tolist()\n\n# Create radar chart\ncreate_radar_chart(evaluation, categories, partner_names)\n```\n\n#### **2. Bar Chart of Overall Scores**\n\n```python\n# Bar Chart of Overall Scores\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\nplt.bar(evaluation['Partner'], evaluation['OverallScore'], color='skyblue')\nplt.title('Overall Scores of Potential Partners')\nplt.xlabel('Partner')\nplt.ylabel('Overall Score')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.savefig('overall_scores_bar_chart.png')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n#### **3. Bar Charts for Each Criterion**\n\nWe'll create a bar chart for each criterion.\n\n```python\ncriteria = ['OrganizationalCapacity', 'ExperienceInSimilarProjects', 'AlignmentWithProgramGoals', 'AbilityToReachTargetAudience']\n\nfor criterion in criteria:\n    plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\n    plt.bar(evaluation['Partner'], evaluation[criterion], color='green')\n    plt.title(f'Partner Scores on {criterion}')\n    plt.xlabel('Partner')\n    plt.ylabel('Score')\n    plt.xticks(rotation=45)\n    plt.ylim(0,5)\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.savefig(f'{criterion}_bar_chart.png')\n    plt.show()\n```\n\n#### **4.

Save the CSV files (`PartnerEvaluation.csv` and `PartnerStrengthsWeaknesses.csv`) into your working directory.\n2. Copy the Python scripts into a `.py` file or Jupyter notebook.\n3. Run the scripts to generate the visuals.\n4. The images will be saved in the working directory with the filenames specified in `plt.savefig()`.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 5: Integrate Visuals into the Report**\n\nInclude the generated visuals in the appropriate sections of the Partner Identification Report.\n\n### **1. Radar Chart**\n\n- **Figure 1: Partner Evaluation Radar Chart**\n  - Place in the section summarizing the evaluation of potential partners.\n  - **Description**: This chart compares the partners across all evaluation criteria, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n### **2.

This vision is achieved by organizing various activities, cultural events, and festivals, as well as supporting government bodies involved in heritage conservation. Additionally, the foundation focuses on empowering youth and professionals through developmental training, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals to foster sustainable cities and communities. ‏This concept was born in response to a series of wars and conflicts that had taken a toll on Nineveh Province, resulting in the loss of many historic cities and archaeological sites. These conflicts negatively impacted the city’s tangible and intangible heritage, cultural legacy, and led to a rise in youth unemployment, revealing an urgent need for skill development to prepare young people for the labor market and to inspire community-driven projects that benefit Iraqi society. ‏The most significant and damaging event in the city’s modern history was the occupation by ISIS in 2014, followed by the liberation war in 2017. These events saw extremist groups destroy much of the remaining old city of Mosul. In response, a group of young people came together to launch the foundation as a voluntary effort, driven by a commitment to safeguarding Iraq’s identity. The project was launched to highlight archaeological and heritage sites, revive cultural heritage, and promote social cohesion among Nineveh’s diverse ethnicities and religions, aiming to foster peace and coexistence. This effort is seen as a vital step in encouraging displaced residents to return to their homes and to preserve the rich heritage and coexistence that define the city. ‏The significance of establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” lies in preserving the historical character of the city, supporting heritage protection efforts alongside government bodies, and partnering with international organizations and the global community. The foundation also envisions fostering connections among youth through awareness-raising and developmental workshops to promote the heritage and history of Nineveh and Iraq, and implementing activities that develop the skills of professionals in culture, heritage, and development fields.\tThe Foundation is committed to achieving its goals through building partnerships and expanding the fields it works in, especially in development and growth through culture, heritage, or capacity building. In addition to the Foundation’s expertise and extensive network, it has earned significant community trust, with over 100,000 visitors to the Foundation in the past two years, as well as participants in its regular programs. Therefore, our vision is that the program aligns with our shared goals, and together we can achieve the best outcomes.\tWe believe that the Mosul Heritage Foundation and the work team have field experience and a strong network of relationships, whether with government agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, or the local community. Therefore, we are pleased to participate in the project to achieve common goals.\tayoobthanoon1992@gmail.com\t50\"\"\"",

This vision is achieved by organizing various activities, cultural events, and festivals, as well as supporting government bodies involved in heritage conservation. Additionally, the foundation focuses on empowering youth and professionals through developmental training, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals to foster sustainable cities and communities. This concept was born in response to a series of wars and conflicts that had taken a toll on Nineveh Province, resulting in the loss of many historic cities and archaeological sites. These conflicts negatively impacted the city’s tangible and intangible heritage, cultural legacy, and led to a rise in youth unemployment, revealing an urgent need for skill development to prepare young people for the labor market and to inspire community-driven projects that benefit Iraqi society. The most significant and damaging event in the city’s modern history was the occupation by ISIS in 2014, followed by the liberation war in 2017. These events saw extremist groups destroy much of the remaining old city of Mosul. In response, a group of young people came together to launch the foundation as a voluntary effort, driven by a commitment to safeguarding Iraq’s identity. The project was launched to highlight archaeological and heritage sites, revive cultural heritage, and promote social cohesion among Nineveh’s diverse ethnicities and religions, aiming to foster peace and coexistence. This effort is seen as a vital step in encouraging displaced residents to return to their homes and to preserve the rich heritage and coexistence that define the city. The significance of establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” lies in preserving the historical character of the city, supporting heritage protection efforts alongside government bodies, and partnering with international organizations and the global community. The foundation also envisions fostering connections among youth through awareness-raising and developmental workshops to promote the heritage and history of Nineveh and Iraq, and implementing activities that develop the skills of professionals in culture, heritage, and development fields.\", \"The Foundation is committed to achieving its goals through building partnerships and expanding the fields it works in, especially in development and growth through culture, heritage, or capacity building. In addition to the Foundation’s expertise and extensive network, it has earned significant community trust, with over 100,000 visitors to the Foundation in the past two years, as well as participants in its regular programs. Therefore, our vision is that the program aligns with our shared goals, and together we can achieve the best outcomes.\", \"We believe that the Mosul Heritage Foundation and the work team have field experience and a strong network of relationships, whether with government agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, or the local community.

This vision is achieved by organizing various activities, cultural events, and festivals, as well as supporting government bodies involved in heritage conservation. Additionally, the foundation focuses on empowering youth and professionals through developmental training, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals to foster sustainable cities and communities. ‏This concept was born in response to a series of wars and conflicts that had taken a toll on Nineveh Province, resulting in the loss of many historic cities and archaeological sites. These conflicts negatively impacted the city’s tangible and intangible heritage, cultural legacy, and led to a rise in youth unemployment, revealing an urgent need for skill development to prepare young people for the labor market and to inspire community-driven projects that benefit Iraqi society. ‏The most significant and damaging event in the city’s modern history was the occupation by ISIS in 2014, followed by the liberation war in 2017. These events saw extremist groups destroy much of the remaining old city of Mosul. In response, a group of young people came together to launch the foundation as a voluntary effort, driven by a commitment to safeguarding Iraq’s identity. The project was launched to highlight archaeological and heritage sites, revive cultural heritage, and promote social cohesion among Nineveh’s diverse ethnicities and religions, aiming to foster peace and coexistence. This effort is seen as a vital step in encouraging displaced residents to return to their homes and to preserve the rich heritage and coexistence that define the city. ‏The significance of establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” lies in preserving the historical character of the city, supporting heritage protection efforts alongside government bodies, and partnering with international organizations and the global community. The foundation also envisions fostering connections among youth through awareness-raising and developmental workshops to promote the heritage and history of Nineveh and Iraq, and implementing activities that develop the skills of professionals in culture, heritage, and development fields.\tThe Foundation is committed to achieving its goals through building partnerships and expanding the fields it works in, especially in development and growth through culture, heritage, or capacity building. In addition to the Foundation’s expertise and extensive network, it has earned significant community trust, with over 100,000 visitors to the Foundation in the past two years, as well as participants in its regular programs. Therefore, our vision is that the program aligns with our shared goals, and together we can achieve the best outcomes.\tWe believe that the Mosul Heritage Foundation and the work team have field experience and a strong network of relationships, whether with government agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, or the local community. Therefore, we are pleased to participate in the project to achieve common goals.\tayoobthanoon1992@gmail.com\t50\"\"\"",

Parsing the data and focusing on accurate quantitative insights is key.\n\n**Ensuring compliance**\n\nI’m working through OpenAI's guidelines, especially the restriction on violent content, to confirm the suitability of the new generateable graphs data.\n\n**Updating data**\n\nThe assistant needs to refresh CSV files, update charts, and adjust the code to align with the latest data, which is structured in a tab-separated format.\n\nConfirming involvement\n\n**Gathering key details**\n\nI'm collecting information on a key staff member, including their name, position, experience, qualifications, and the organization's alignment with the BEIT project's objectives.\n\n**Considering data structures**\n\nI’m piecing together the table format by analyzing the header to identify column names. This helps in organizing the data effectively for analysis.\n\n**Evaluating potential partners**\n\nI’m thinking through sustainability project partnerships, considering factors like regional operations, travel readiness, and experience in youth outreach and sustainability. Progress involves identifying key staff and their qualifications.\n\n**Confirming training specifics**\n\nI’m piecing together the details of the training programs, mentorship, and resources provided by Five One Labs, particularly their impact on financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and soft skills. The missing field at the end is noted.\n\n**Organizing the data**\n\nI'm working through the \"Email Address\" and \"Estimated number of people reached\" fields, linking them to corresponding entries. Then, I will update the CSV accordingly.\n\n**Extracting and charting data**\n\nI'm pulling together info to update CSV files and charts, detailing steps and incorporating new data. This ensures clarity and precision throughout the process.\n\n**Summarizing stakeholders**\n\nI’m working through a table of stakeholders by merging previous and new data. Also, I’m considering potential graphs to visualize the data effectively.\n\n**Identifying key details**\n\nOK, let me see. This table highlights organizations by name, website, contact info, mission, and areas of expertise. It also shows their experience with sustainability, training programs, and alignment with BEIT project objectives.\n\nThe data might be missing the email address, and the last field, \"Estimated number of people reached through your programs in general in the last year,\" could also be missing for Five One Labs.\n\n**Highlighting organizational expertise**\n\nMakers of Baghdad is a non-profit NGO, established in 2016, led by Managing Director Ali Taher. The organization has a notable track record in sustainable construction training programs, specifically tailored to the environment of Baghdad and Iraq.\n\n**Aligning expertise**\n\nMakers of Baghdad boasts a proven track record in sustainable construction and community development, aligning with the BEIT project's youth training and affordable housing goals. They aim to integrate the BEIT project's resources to enhance their programs, with a notable focus on increasing women's participation in construction.\n\n**Identifying the gap**\n\nI’m thinking through missing elements in the email and last field. This seems to be an email issue, potentially from an API response head.\n\n**Showcasing expertise**\n\nMosul Space Organization for Development exemplifies experience in sustainable construction training, covering an array of areas such as renewable energy, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship, and actively engages in technical and soft skills development.\n\n**Generating fresh insights**\n\nI’m pulling together new data to craft engaging and intriguing graphs. This not only updates the existing CSV but also breathes new life into our insights, making them more vivid and insightful.\n\n**Crafting data visualizations**\n\nI’m outlining potential graphs to show demographics, regions, and impact, like bar and pie charts, and heatmaps, based on detailed datasets.\n\nCHUNK\n\n**Setting up the table**\n\nI’m organizing a database with columns for organizational traits, experience in sustainability training, regions of operation, and demographic reach. This will allow for a comprehensive view of stakeholders and their involvement in sustainability efforts.",
