Claude, with the green hat, is our idea guy. Prunella, in the black hat, spots potential problems. Percy, the yellow-hat duck, highlights the positives. Cyril, wearing the red hat, trusts his gut feelings. And Quackers, in the blue hat, pulls everything together into a plan. How can we help you today?",
