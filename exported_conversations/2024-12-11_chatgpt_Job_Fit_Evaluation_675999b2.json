      "content": "Based on what I know about you, this job could be a good fit for the following reasons:\n\n### Why It Fits:\n1. **Alignment with Your Passion for Impact and Innovation:**\n   - Your interest in social entrepreneurship, post-traumatic growth, and creating environments that foster positive change aligns with the fellowship's mission of empowering young people to address global environmental challenges.\n   - The role's focus on sustainability, innovation, and venture-building ties in well with your work on sustainable housing and entrepreneurship ecosystems.\n\n2. **Experience in Curriculum Design and Training Programs:**\n   - Your experience designing cohort-based learning programs and educational frameworks would be highly applicable to the venture-building strategy and coaching elements of this role.\n   - You've worked on projects integrating modern pedagogies, which could be valuable in tailoring programming for fellows.\n\n3. **Familiarity with Global and Local Challenges:**\n   - Your experience working in diverse and often conflict-impacted regions, such as Mosul and Lebanon, matches the role's emphasis on supporting fellows from various backgrounds.\n\n4. **Network and Expertise:**\n   - Your extensive network in social entrepreneurship, sustainability, and impact-focused initiatives could be an asset in building relationships with investors, partners, and ecosystem contributors.\n   - Your previous work with organizations like the UN and training-of-trainers programs gives you credibility in working with high-profile stakeholders.\n\n5. **Values-Driven Leadership:**\n   - The emphasis on empathy, collaboration, and youth leadership resonates with your belief in humor, agency, and resilience as tools for overcoming challenges.\n\n---\n\n### Why It Might Not Fit:\n1. **Potential Mismatch with Your Current Focus:**\n   - If you're leaning toward writing your book on Islamic economics or focusing on deeply ecological economic perspectives, this role might pull you away from those priorities.\n\n2. **Geographic and Logistical Considerations:**\n   - The position is Berlin-based, which might be a challenge if you're not ready to relocate or prefer remote-first roles. Although there is flexibility, 50% in-office work could be a constraint.\n\n3. **Scope and Management Scale:**\n   - Leading a team of 13-15 people and overseeing multiple aspects of a large program could require significant time and energy, potentially limiting your capacity for personal projects or research.\n\n4. **Fit with Broader Career Goals:**\n   - If you're looking to focus more on high-level consulting or entrepreneurship, this role's operational and execution-heavy demands might not align with your ideal trajectory.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nThis job seems like a strong match for your skills and experience, particularly if you're passionate about youth leadership, environmental impact, and venture-building. However, it’s important to weigh the opportunity against your current priorities and whether the role aligns with your long-term goals. If you're inclined to apply, it could be helpful to reflect on how this position might support your vision for creating systemic change while allowing room for your personal and professional aspirations.",

Identifying this nexus between heritage and the needed transformations to a more sustainable construction sector built bridges and excited people to look into and take pride in their own history to build their own future. \n2. Biggest challenges was getting information and connecting with the right stakeholders. Going on site and creating open contexts for people to share in meetups and working with local organizations like Mosul Space opened doors to a diversity of people from universities, govornent sector, and local entrepreneurs. Moving from requesting digital forms to be filled out to in-person meetings in groups. And then from broad groups to 1-1 meetings proved to create the depth and space to get the most interesting and accurate insights. Lunch meetings are great! ;D\n3. We conducted test runs with the participants to ensure the content was engaging and rich. By demonstrating a willingness to take feedback we shifted perspectives from critique, to collaboration.

With both founders of Bloom becoming fathers while the war in Lebanon/Palestine rages, undermining our efforts, I’m looking for opportunities to find a home for my 15 years of experience in supporting the development of ecosystems of innovation and social entrepreneurship. The potential to work with the DO, to collaborate with a new team, and to find ways to leverage the relationships, networks, and systems we’ve developed at Bloom means that the heart of the work we’ve been doing can grow and reach new people. \n\n \n\nYouth are inheriting a world of great problems and are worried and scared. In a 2021 survey of 10,000 sixteen-to-twenty-five-year-olds from 10 different countries, 75% of the respondents said that “the future is frightening,” and most think “humanity is doomed”. It’s also proven that climate anxiety symptoms are improved when youth actively do something about the challenges they see. Programs like the DO School Fellowship are essential to providing resources, community, and context supporting young people in becoming proactive co-constructors of their future. \n\n \n\nPreviously it was large corporations and governments providing jobs and schools prepared people to fit into, rather than create systems. The work of nurturing agency, purposeful action, community, and contribution can help heal our alienation from each other, the planet, and ourselves. The DO School Fellowship’s efforts to build programs, networks, and sustainable support for young people on the front lines of our transforming world is a beautiful and worthy cause.\n\nPerhaps, one day, my little one year old baby Suleiman will be lucky enough to be a DO Fellow. - what do you think? how can it be improved/ connect with your answer to \"Why are you interested in working with The DO? *:\"",

      "content": "Here’s a revised and refined version of your \"why me\" statement, integrating elements from my earlier response to \"Why are you interested in working with The DO?\" to create a cohesive and compelling narrative:\n\n---\n\nThe DO School’s mission of working with youth to unlock human potential for positive change feels like a natural extension of my life’s work and the work we’ve been doing at Bloom. Over the past 15 years, I’ve dedicated my career to supporting ecosystems of innovation and social entrepreneurship, particularly in post-conflict and underserved regions. As the co-founder of Bloom, I’ve helped build a platform that has empowered nearly a thousand enterprises, working with young innovators to foster agency, community, and resilience. Now, as both founders of Bloom navigate new parenthood against the backdrop of war in Lebanon and Palestine, I’m seeking an opportunity to contribute my experience to a new home where it can continue to grow, adapt, and make an impact.\n\nYouth today are inheriting a world of complex and urgent challenges. In a 2021 global survey of 16-to-25-year-olds, 75% said they found the future “frightening,” and many believe “humanity is doomed.” However, research shows that climate anxiety can improve when young people actively engage with the issues they care about. Programs like the DO School Fellowship play a crucial role in equipping youth with the resources, community, and tools to move from fear to action, enabling them to co-create solutions and take ownership of their futures.\n\nFor centuries, education prepared people to fit into systems designed by corporations or governments. Today, our task is to empower young people to design new systems—ones rooted in agency, purposeful action, and sustainable collaboration. This work is vital not only for addressing external challenges but also for healing our collective alienation from each other, the planet, and ourselves. The DO School Fellowship’s commitment to building programs, networks, and sustainable support for youth on the front lines of global transformation is a cause I believe in deeply.\n\nIt would be a privilege to bring my experience, networks, and passion to The DO, collaborating with your team to help shape the next generation of leaders. And perhaps one day, my one-year-old son, Suleiman, will grow up in a world transformed by the Fellows I’ve had the honor of supporting through this incredible program.\n\n---\n\nThis version weaves in the personal, professional, and emotional connections to The DO’s mission while highlighting your unique qualifications and vision for the role. It also ties back seamlessly to your earlier statement about why you're interested in working with The DO, creating a cohesive narrative. Let me know if you'd like any further refinements!",

Leveraging the availability of vacated factories, the free time of the newly unemployed, and the momentum of the open-source movement, the idea emerged to create the world and jobs we wanted ourselves, and to do it differently. To do it together, sharing resources, ideas, tools, rent, etc. This shift in expecting a future pathway to be determined by external, larger power structures, corporates or govornments, to a grassroots movement creating communities of empowerment and sharing and building a future ourselves was foundational to my future thinking and career. During the Arab Spring I saw young people in the Middle East ask for the power structures to be toppled and changed. I thought this was the ideal time to suggest not a changing of power structures from the top, but the inversion of it by bringing grassroots organizing, community support, innovation and entrepreneurship to the Middle East. I started The Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative first, promoting and supporting the creation of innovation communities and spaces from Egypt to Nigeria and Iraq and beyond. Then in 2016, I realized the necessity for deeper support to leverage the innovation capacities and direct them towards social and ecological challenges, and Bloom was born.\n \nBloom has been innovating on building personal and professional growth pedagogies, supporting social entrepreneurs in building wellbeing and impact simultaneously.

My question was centered around the question: when things get difficult, what are the ways that social entrepreneurs respond and what are the factors that lead to the different responses. I wanted to know who preservered and maintained a sense of balance and how did they keep providing their social/ecological impact given what was happening just after a catastrophy.

During this period, I saw the opportunity to transform vacated factories, the free time of the unemployed, and the momentum of the open-source movement into a grassroots shift—creating the jobs and future we wanted by sharing resources, tools, ideas, and space. This foundational experience shaped my belief in the power of grassroots organizing and community-driven innovation to build resilient systems and transform lives.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring, as young people in the Middle East demanded systemic change, I saw the potential for not just top-down reform, but for an inversion of power—empowering communities to build their own future through grassroots organizing, innovation, and entrepreneurship. This inspired me to launch The Global Entrepreneurship and Maker Space Initiative (GEMSI), promoting and supporting innovation communities and spaces from Egypt to Nigeria and Iraq. In 2016, I founded Bloom to provide deeper support for leveraging these innovation capacities, channeling them toward solving social and ecological challenges.\n\nAt Bloom, we have pioneered personal and professional growth pedagogies, empowering social entrepreneurs to achieve both wellbeing and impact. My Master’s research on post-traumatic growth emerged from my experiences working in Lebanon during the pandemic and the Beirut Port Explosion. I sought to understand what factors helped social entrepreneurs persevere and maintain balance during crises, and how they continued to deliver social and ecological impact. These insights shaped Bloom’s Accelerator pedagogy and emphasized the critical role of self-knowledge and personal growth in creating sustainable change.\n\nProfessionally, my work has connected me with foundations, corporations, and iNGOs, managing teams, building technological prototypes, and developing wellbeing-centered program designs. Personally, I have deepened my commitment to personal growth practices, recognizing that the greatest impact starts with oneself and expands outward—to those around us and through the work we do.\n\nI believe these experiences and skills—rooted in community empowerment, innovative program design, and a holistic approach to sustainability—align closely with The DO’s mission. The opportunity to leverage this expertise in collaboration with The DO’s team would allow me to amplify the impact of my work and contribute meaningfully to supporting young innovators as they create the future they want to see.  \n\n---\n\nThis version ensures a balance between storytelling, impact, and professionalism, while emphasizing how your unique experiences and insights qualify you for the position at The DO.

Since the 2008 economic downturn, I’ve been dedicated to rethinking the way we build futures—not by relying on large corporations or governments, but by empowering grassroots communities to create opportunities themselves. This vision has guided my career, from founding hackerspaces across the Middle East with GEMSI to launching Bloom, a venture development platform that supports enterprises in solving social and ecological challenges.  \n\nWhat excites me most about joining The DO is the potential to work with youth and support them in becoming proactive co-creators of their futures. Programs like *beVisioneers* are critical in a time when young people feel increasingly anxious about the future—helping them channel that fear into meaningful, planet-positive action. This work matters deeply to me, and I’ve seen firsthand how programs like these not only equip participants with practical tools but also foster agency, belonging, and hope.  \n\nAt Bloom, we’ve worked with 933 enterprises across 16 countries, running over 100 accelerator cycles and engaging hundreds of mentors to build communities of innovation and support. I’ve designed pedagogies that integrate wellbeing with impact, informed by my Master’s research on post-traumatic growth, where I explored how social entrepreneurs sustain their efforts during crises. Whether facilitating workshops in Arabic in Mosul, running design-thinking programs with marginalized youth in Lebanon, or managing cross-cultural teams, I’ve always sought to build environments where people can thrive and grow.  \n\nThe DO School feels like a natural next step—a place where I can bring my experience in program design, grassroots organizing, and collaborative leadership to a team equally dedicated to creating lasting impact. I’m eager to leverage the lessons, networks, and systems I’ve developed to help The DO expand its reach and continue building a better future.  \n\nAnd perhaps, one day, my one-year-old son, Suleiman, will have the chance to learn and grow as a DO Fellow.  \n\nThank you for considering my application.
