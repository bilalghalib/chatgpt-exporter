      "content": "The user wants me to extract powerful stories from these transcripts about green building and insulation in Mosul, Iraq. They want:\n1. Robust stories with details, not snippets\n2. Tagged by who said them\n3. Original Arabic pulled out\n4. Short English summaries that are true to reality\n5. Named properly\n\nLet me go through each document and find the compelling stories:\n\nDocument 1 - MUTHANNA AL-MASHHADANI (insulation expert):\n- Story about convincing a customer about insulation by showing before/after examples\n- Story about electricity costs and how people in Mosul don't pay their electricity bills\n- Personal story about his own insulated house using only a cooler instead of AC\n\nDocument 2 - AYA NIZAR BASHEER (engineer):\n- Story about ICF concrete foam construction reducing heat by 17 degrees\n- Story about the company owner building his own house first to test the technology in 2013\n- Story about people abandoning second floors in summer due to heat\n\nDocument 3 - Ghassan (insulation contractor):\n- Story about a house using 400-500 liters of heating oil that was cut in half after insulation\n- Story about working in Baghdad and Erbil for the same client who insisted on full insulation in Erbil\n- Story about measuring temperatures before/after insulation showing dramatic differences\n\nDocument 4 - OMAR LAITH (architect):\n- Story about betting a client that insulation would reduce temperature by 10 degrees or it's free\n- Story about clients being invited to weddings years later because of satisfaction\n- Story about government buildings with no space for visitors, forcing them to wait in the sun\n\nLet me extract these stories properly with the Arabic text and context.Looking through the transcripts, here are the powerful stories with details:\n\n## 1. **The Temperature Bet** - Omar Laith (Architect)\n**Arabic:**\n> قلتلهم المشروع، قلتلهم يابا عزل حراري، ما اقتنعه، قلتلهم زين، أعطيك أعطيكم شي. أنا راح أتفق مع المكتب اللي راح ينفذ لي العزل الحراري، إذا نزل لي 10 درجات مئوية، فرق ما بين الداخل والخارج تدفعون فلوس، إذا أقل من عشرة ما تدفعون فلوس... واضح ما اشتغلنا. إي أنطينا مجال أسبوع إي لحد ما أخذ، خلينا نقول الكفاءة العالية. فحصناها، نزلنا 17 درجة\n\n**Story:** When Omar was trying to convince a skeptical client about thermal insulation 3-4 years ago in Mosul, he made a bold bet. He told them: \"If the insulation reduces the temperature difference between inside and outside by 10 degrees Celsius, you pay. If it's less than 10 degrees, it's free.\" After installation and a week of testing, the temperature dropped by 17 degrees. The client felt like they got double their money's worth - not because it was actually double, but psychologically they felt they had \"beaten\" the contractor. This became a reference case that Omar filmed and used to convince future clients.\n\n## 2. **The Wedding Invitations** - Omar Laith (Architect)\n**Arabic:**\n> لأن لأن ببساطة أنا أحب جميع الزبائن، وللمعلومة والاطلاع البارحة إم كنت في عرس لأحد أصحاب البيوت قبل ثلاث سنوات، مكملنا بيتها، البارحة كنت معزوم في عرس ابنه\n\n**Story:** Omar measures his success not by immediate profit but by long-term relationships. He was invited to the wedding of a client's son - three years after completing their house. This reflects the Mosul tradition where if you truly help someone with their home, you become part of their extended family. He emphasizes that in Mosul's tight-knit community, reputation spreads quickly, and he knows details about other engineers' work without ever meeting them.\n\n## 3. **The Oil Heater Transformation** - Ghassan (Insulation Contractor)\n**Arabic:**\n> يعني عندنا أنا عندي تجربة، مرة اشتغلت بيت. يصرف معدل بالشتاء خلال 34 أشهر، يصرف لها 400 إلى 500 لتر جهاز... بعد ما عتزلنا له، يعني الموسم الثاني، الشتاء اللي بعده إجا قالي والله تقريبا نص القيمة\n\n**Story:** Ghassan insulated a large house that was consuming 400-500 liters of heating oil during the 3-4 month winter season. The following winter, the owner called him saying they only used half that amount. At approximately 200 liters saved at $1/liter, they saved about $200 that winter. The insulation cost around $2,400, meaning the payback period was roughly 2 years just from heating savings alone.\n\n## 4. **The Tale of Two Cities** - Ghassan (Insulation Contractor)\n**Arabic:**\n> نفس الشخص نفذ مؤ عند بناء بيت أربيل. اتصل بيا؟ قالي استاذ غسان ياريت تيجي تيجي تنفذلي برميل، قلت له ايه؟ فلما رحت لأربيل قال لي قالي البيت كله عسل لي ياه داخل خارج سطح، قلي الر العزل رهيب، طلع قلي بغداد، نحنا الجو عندنا ما ينحمل. قال لي أنا سبات. قال لي أنا عندي ببغداد، استفادت تفصل، قال لي هذا الشيء مستحيل\n\n**Story:** The same client built houses in both Baghdad and Erbil. In Baghdad, his air conditioners never stopped running. After experiencing the benefits in Erbil, he called Ghassan desperately wanting full insulation - walls, ceiling, everything. He said it was \"impossible\" to live in Baghdad's heat with constantly running ACs. The contrast between his two houses in different climates made him a true believer. The Erbil house cost $13,000 to fully insulate but transformed his quality of life.\n\n## 5. **The Second Floor Abandonment** - Muthanna Al-Mashhadani & Aya Nizar Basheer\n**Arabic from Muthanna:**\n> إحنا بنانا كله تعرف بيوت من عازلة طوابقية وثلاثة يعني 90% من الطابق الثاني، من يجي الصيف ينزل إلى الطابق الأرضي يعوف ويتركها\n\n**Arabic from Aya:**\n> أكثرية الناس هاهاها تستغني عن الطابق الأول، تنزلي الأرضي في سبيل توفر البرودة\n\n**Story:** Both engineers confirm that 90% of Mosul families abandon their second floors during summer, essentially losing half their house for months. The upper floors become unbearable ovens. This is such a common phenomenon that it's become normalized - families design their lives around this seasonal migration within their own homes.\n\n## 6. **The Cooler vs. AC House** - Muthanna Al-Mashhadani\n**Arabic:**\n> أنا هسه الكهرباء وطنية، أنا ما مشغلة، مشغل وحدة تبريد إللي هي المبردة تعرفها أنت المبردة إي إي ليش؟ المبردات تسحب إثنين إمبير إي. السبليت يسحب 15 أمبير، صح؟ أنا مكتفي بالمباردة، ليش؟ لأنه البيت معزول\n\n**Story:** Muthanna lives in a 300m² house but only uses an evaporative cooler (2 amps) instead of AC units (15 amps each). His house is so well insulated that a simple cooler suffices for the entire space. He jokes that while he's having this conversation and sweating from talking, his house temperature is perfectly comfortable with just one cooler for the whole house.\n\n## 7. **The Free Electricity Mindset** - Muthanna Al-Mashhadani\n**Arabic:**\n> المواطن هنا دا يعتبر الكهرباء مجانا. ما دا يعتبرها إنه هذا الشي من الدولة؟... أنا أعرف زوارين يقول أنا ما أدفع ورقة مال، الكهرباء، الكهرباء أصلا مجانا، المفروض تكون أني ما ملزم أن أدفعها\n\n**Story:** Muthanna explains the biggest obstacle to selling insulation: many Mosul residents don't pay electricity bills. They accumulate bills for months or years, sometimes selling houses with unpaid utilities. His neighbors openly say \"Electricity should be free, I'm not obligated to pay.\" When he pitches insulation as saving electricity costs, they respond \"What costs? Electricity is free!\" This only changes in areas like Erbil where prepaid electricity cards force conservation awareness.\n\n## 8. **The Construction Pioneer** - Aya Nizar Basheer\n**Arabic:**\n> هو من البداية حب إنه شا شاف هاي المادة وشي وجاب الثورة وعمل، وبعدين راسل معمل بال آ بغداد وفر ها المواد... هو أول شي، وجربوا إنه كان حتى كوادر عاملة ما. تشتغله أو تتخوف من العمل عليه\n\n**Story:** The owner of Aswaar Al-Mosul construction company discovered ICF (Insulated Concrete Forms) technology and was so convinced he built his own house with it in 2013 as the first test case. Even his workers were afraid to work with this \"foam\" material, thinking it wouldn't be strong enough. He had to train them step by step, paying them well to overcome their fears. Now they've built over 100 houses with this technology, but other construction firms still spread fear about it to protect their market share.\n\n## 9. **The Sunlight Cure** - Omar Laith\n**Arabic:**\n> أنا أتحدى بيها على على في مكتبي أني وفي البيوت إللي أنفذها، أقول لهم إذا كان المنور إم أو ال ال ال الكورت مالتك الصغير داخل البيت، إذا كان اتجاهه، فوتلك شمس إنت أوتوماتيكليا صيف شتاء ما صربك إنفلونزا\n\n**Story:** Omar makes a bold claim to his clients: if your internal courtyard gets direct sunlight, you won't get the flu - summer or winter. He's tested this with multiple houses he's designed, later asking families to honestly report their illness rates. Those with sun-facing courtyards confirm they get sick less. He uses this health angle to convince clients that green design isn't just about energy - it's about killing airborne viruses naturally.\n\n## 10. **The Government Building Shame** - Omar Laith\n**Arabic:**\n> لو تجي تسوي استبيان، لو تجي تسوي استبيان. بعد ال خلينا نقول بعد ال2003 بعد 2003 بعد دخول الأمريكان للعراق اللي اشتغل في كردستان، الغالبية العظمى مهندسين من الموصل\n\n**Story:** Omar observes that most Iraqi government buildings are designed only for employees, forcing citizens to wait outside in the sun. There's no consideration for the 100+ daily visitors. This represents a fundamental failure in sustainable, human-centered design. He contrasts this with proper planning that would include 125 seats in air-conditioned waiting areas for 100 expected daily visitors.",
