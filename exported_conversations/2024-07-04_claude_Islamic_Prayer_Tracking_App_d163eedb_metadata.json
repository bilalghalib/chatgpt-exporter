I can stay high level and say I missed 50% of all of them or i can go into each one fajir thuhur asr maghrib and isha and say how much I think i missed for that whole time frame. then the home page has a screen with a bar at the top representing total needed to be prayed and total prayed so far and then has five buttons for each prayer. when you click on that button it should fill in the farthest back prayer in the record and slowly fill up a progress bar representing that prayer. you should be able to edit details and get into each year, each month and go down to each prayer and modify the percentage prayed after the initialization screen, otherwise it should mostly focus on the home screen and counting up prayers. the prayers need to be saved on the phone so when you close/open it is preserved, you should be able to \"restart\" and go to the initialization process again.
