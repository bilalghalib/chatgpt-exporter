      "content": "The package in your image contains **Khorasan wheat flour (Kamut® brand)**, a type of **ancient wheat**. Here’s what makes it special and how it’s used:\n\n### **What is Khorasan Wheat (Kamut®)?**\nKhorasan wheat (*Triticum turgidum ssp. turanicum*), often sold under the **Kamut®** brand, is an ancient grain that predates modern wheat. It is believed to have originated in the **Fertile Crescent**, including parts of modern-day Iran and Egypt.\n\n### **What’s Special About It?**\n1. **Higher Nutritional Value** – Compared to modern wheat, it has:\n   - **Higher protein content** (~13-15% per 100g)\n   - More **essential minerals** like selenium, zinc, and magnesium\n   - A higher percentage of **healthy lipids** and amino acids\n   \n2. **Easier to Digest** – Many people find it more **digestible than modern wheat**, though it **still contains gluten**, so it's not suitable for celiacs.\n\n3. **Richer Flavor** – It has a **nutty, buttery taste**, making it popular for artisanal baking.\n\n4. **Organically Grown** – The Kamut® brand guarantees that the wheat is always **organic and never hybridized or genetically modified**.\n\n### **What Is It Used For?**\nKhorasan wheat flour is used in:\n- **Bread baking** (especially sourdough and whole wheat loaves)\n- **Pasta** (it gives a chewy, flavorful texture)\n- **Pastries and cakes** (often mixed with other flours)\n- **Pancakes, waffles, and crepes**\n- **Traditional Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dishes**\n\nBecause of its **high protein and gluten content**, it works well for making **dense, rustic breads** but is less ideal for highly airy baked goods unless mixed with softer wheat flours.\n\nWould you like any recipe ideas using Khorasan wheat flour?",
