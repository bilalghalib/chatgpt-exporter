We\ncreated it to help accelerators and program managers focus on impact and inclusive\nentrepreneurship in developing/emerging ecosystems through skill-based and\ncharacter-based support.\nHow to use this step-by-step guide?\nRunning accelerator programs is a young and evolving field. With limited proven\nresearch into best practices, we do not wish to claim a set formula or one-size-fits-all\napproach. Accelerator models vary significantly depending on their objectives.\nInstead, the guide aims to help program managers understand some of the critical\nchoices and challenges they'll need to consider if they're considering building a\nprogram of their own. It combines lessons from previous practices and patterns we\nidentified over the years to highlight and frame the strategic choices facing\nstakeholders interested in creating and running these programs.\nWe developed this guide into two sections:\n● \nSection 1: The Bloom Framework \n🌻\nThis section will help you understand our framework and assessment suite.\n● \nSection 2: Running an Accelerator Program \n🌟\nThis section covers the critical aspects of creating and running an accelerator in six\nsimple stages. Each stage comes with a series of toolkits to help you think about your\nplans and the context of accelerator design.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 1 of 41\n\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻\nAlso here: \nBloom Framework v0.9 - Two Pillars (draft)\nBloom's Training Framework offers a dynamic, adaptive learning environment for\nindividuals, teams, and organizations through a guided project-based and\ncohort-based learning approach. It focuses on two core pillars:\n1. The Individual: Featuring Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH), Universal\nSkills, Character Strengths, and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\nAssessments.\n2. The Organization: Featuring the Organizational Development Assessment.\nThe framework helps assess core strengths and weaknesses, prioritizing areas for\nlearning and development. Our goal is to simplify the creation of custom learning\njourneys, enabling teams and program managers to identify optimal learning\nopportunities, foster a supportive environment, and positively impact businesses.\nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement\nacross both pillars, ensuring simultaneous development and, for example, improving\nan individual's skill through activities that address core organizational needs.\nEntrepreneurs identify their priority development areas based on assessment results\nand customize their learning journey with program managers, co-creating a tailored\ncurriculum for the cohort.\nOur framework is based on proven cohort-based and project-based learning methods\ncombined with the power of mentorship. Peer learning enhances the experience, while\nproject-based learning aligns objectives with a mission or vision, fostering intrinsic\nmotivation. Using a flipped classroom approach, entrepreneurs first digest relevant\ncontent, reflect on their learnings, and apply them in their enterprises. They then meet\nwith their cohort for peer feedback and mentorship, using what they learn in real-life\nsettings.\nOur programs nurture individual and organizational development, promoting\ncooperation over competition and leveraging collective intelligence to solve pressing\nsocietal problems.\nThe Bloom Training Framework is versatile and can be used in various contexts,\nincluding companies, educational programs (youth, school, university), startup\naccelerators, and short events like startup sprints or hackathons.\nOur Principles\nWe use the following guiding principles to evaluate and prioritize program activities:\n1. Keep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat. (Upside down pyramid) \\/\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the teams in our programs to help them do\nthe right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous,\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 2 of 41\n\nnonaligned activities. We want to keep the teams and participants in the driver's seat\nand help them develop decision-making skills. We can help people develop skills of\neffectiveness by creating an enabling environment.\n2. Transformation > Information. Make available knowledge actionable. (Library\ncontent)\nPrioritizing transformative learning experiences over mere information dissemination\nensures that knowledge is applied in meaningful ways. By providing actionable insights\nand practical tools, we create an environment where learning translates into real-world\nimpact.\n3. Get the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessments)\nOptimizing team composition by aligning individual strengths and roles enhances\noverall team effectiveness. Through comprehensive assessments, we identify key areas\nfor personal and professional growth, enabling targeted interventions that maximize\nindividual and collective potential.\nWhy integrate individual growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team is\ndetermined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal\ndevelopment and well-being are also an end, we ensure that the teams are more\nrobust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps\ncultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth\nmindset and a contributor attitude.\n4. Create an enabling environment in the program and support the broader\necosystem.\nFostering a supportive community within cohort-based programs is essential for\ncreating an enabling environment where entrepreneurs can thrive. By nurturing a\nculture of collaboration and mutual support, we enhance the learning experience and\ncontribute to the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem. We win when we win together.\nPillar 1: The Individual\nBloom recommends the following individual development assessments:\n1. Wellbeing & Engagement: at work & in life (through PERMAH)\n2. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of\nentrepreneurship and leadership\n3. Character Strengths: through VIA, Values in Action\n4. Universal Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life)\n1.1. Wellbeing & Engagement\nOur Wellbeing and Engagement assessment is rooted in the principles of positive\npsychology and aims to measure human flourishing. This assessment evaluates six\ncritical dimensions. These dimensions are essential indicators of a well-lived life, each\ncontributing uniquely to an individual's overall sense of wellbeing.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 3 of 41\n\n1. Positivity: Measures the extent to which an individual experiences positive\nemotions, crucial for enhancing resilience and overall mental health.\n2. Engagement: Assesses the level of involvement and absorption in activities,\nreflecting a flow state where individuals are fully immersed and find deep\nsatisfaction.\n3. Relationships: Evaluates the quality of an individual's connections with others,\nrecognizing that supportive and fulfilling relationships are fundamental to\nwellbeing.\n4. Meaning: Gauges the sense of purpose and direction in life, indicating how\nmuch individuals feel their lives have significance and contribute to something\ngreater.\n5. Achievement: Measures the accomplishment of goals and the sense of mastery,\nhighlighting the importance of setting and achieving personal and professional\nobjectives.\n6. Health: Assesses physical wellbeing, acknowledging that a healthy body is\nessential for overall life satisfaction.\nUsing the PERMAH framework, we ensure our programs focus on professional success\nand personal flourishing. This approach helps individuals and organizations achieve\nsustainable success by aligning personal wellbeing with organizational goals.\n1.2. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\nThe Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessment evaluates proficiency in\nrecognizing opportunities, mobilizing resources, and taking effective action in various\ncontexts. This assessment is based on the EntreComp framework, a comprehensive tool\ndeveloped by the European Commission to promote entrepreneurship education and\ntraining. EntreComp offers a common reference framework that defines the key\ncompetencies necessary for entrepreneurial behavior and mindset.\nWe use the EntrepComp framework to help people build skills along six dimensions:\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 4 of 41\n\n1.3. Character Strengths\nCharacter strengths are invaluable tools that guide us in developing skills and\nenhancing our effectiveness in any endeavor. Leveraging these strengths makes\nlearning new things more accessible and enjoyable. In Bloom programs, we use the\nValues in Action (VIA) Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their\n“Signature Strengths.” These strengths appear naturally and authentically, providing\nenergy rather than requiring effort. Using our Signature Strengths promotes well-being\nand vitality in the workplace, leading to greater engagement and productivity. The VIA\nassessment analyzes virtues and values across cultures, identifying 24 universally\nrecognized character strengths. These strengths are clustered into six core virtues:\n1. Wisdom and Knowledge: Creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of\nlearning, perspective, and innovation. These strengths enable us to gain and use\nknowledge effectively.\n2. Courage: Bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality, and zest. These strengths help us\nface challenges and pursue goals despite obstacles.\n3. Humanity: Love, kindness, and social intelligence. These strengths foster\nmeaningful and supportive relationships with others.\n4. Justice: Citizenship, fairness, and leadership. These strengths contribute to a just\nand equitable community.\n5. Temperance: Forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, and self-control. These\nstrengths help us regulate our behaviors and emotions.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 5 of 41\n\n6. Transcendence: Appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor,\nand spirituality. These strengths connect us to something greater and provide a\nsense of purpose and meaning.\nBy identifying and using our Signature Strengths, we can bring energy and positivity to\nour work, fostering a thriving and productive environment. This approach to personal\ndevelopment ensures that individuals achieve professional success and lead fulfilling\nand meaningful lives.\n1.4. Universal Skills.\nUniversal Skills are competencies that benefit individuals across all organizational\nsectors and roles. These skills are critical to our personal development framework,\nensuring team members can thrive regardless of their specific\npersonal or professional requirements. Our approach to\ndeveloping Universal Skills is guided by the Universal Skills\nFramework from SkillsBuilder.org, which categorizes these skills\ninto four key dimensions:\n1. Communication: Enhancing the ability to convey ideas\nclearly and effectively fostering better understanding and\ncollaboration.\n2. Problem Solving: Equipping individuals to analyze\nsituations, identify challenges, and develop practical\nsolutions, thereby improving decision-making and\ninnovation.\n3. Self-Management: Developing personal discipline, time\nmanagement, and resilience to navigate complex tasks\nand maintain productivity under pressure.\n4. Teamwork: Cultivating the skills necessary for effective\ncollaboration, including empathy, cooperation, and\nworking harmoniously in diverse teams.\nFocusing on these four dimensions ensures that our team\nmembers are equipped with versatile skills applicable in any\ncontext. This development approach enhances individual\nperformance and contributes to our organization's overall\neffectiveness and adaptability. Using the Universal Skills Framework, we provide\nstructured and targeted training that supports continuous personal and professional\ngrowth, ensuring that our teams are well-prepared to meet the demands of the\nmodern workplace.\nHow To Apply the Individual Development Framework:\n1. Request your participants to take the Bloom Individual Development\nassessments on the Bloom Platform, which include Universal Skills, Well-being\nand Engagement, and Character Strengths.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 6 of 41\n\n2. In program cycles, discussions with peers, mentors, and program managers can\nhelp participants identify & improve individual growth priorities and select\nactivities for development from their knowledge, online resources, or the Bloom\nLibrary of Activities.\n3. For Character Strengths:\na. After the individuals take the Character Strengths assessments, you can\nrequest individuals and teams to identify their Signature Strengths.\nb. Once they’ve identified their Signature Strengths, request individuals to\nselect a priority area within their Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship &\nLeadership Skills results on the Bloom Learn tab.\n4. End-of-program assessments help participants and program managers see\ngrowth and chart paths for further improvement.\nKEY POINTS:\n1. The Bloom Personal Framework involves critical skills and values that help you\nbe effective as a person.\n2. It includes Well-being & Engagement, Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills,\nCharacter Strengths and Universal Skills.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates)\n1.

Permah Survey Home - The PERMAH Wellbeing Survey\n3. VIA Character Strengths Survey & Character Reports | VIA Institute\nPillar 2: The Organization\nBloom recommends the following organizational development assessment:\nThe Organizational Development Assessment is a way to assess your enterprise’s\norganizational status and needs quickly. Teams use it as a self-assessment tool, a\nguided collaborative process, or program managers can do third-party assessments.\n2.1. Organizational Development\nOrganizational Capacity is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission while\nanticipating and managing future changes and risks. Our Organizational Capacity\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 7 of 41\n\nAssessment is derived from established methodologies by international consulting\nfirms, tailored specifically for enterprises and accelerators. Bloom’s Organizational\nCapacities assessment helps organizations identify blind spots, providing a 360-degree\nperspective on their current state and guiding them in selecting development areas\nthat will have the most impact. We offer adapted versions of the assessment for\nenterprises, early-stage enterprises, and accelerators.\nThe Organizational Capacity Assessment categories are:\n🎯 \nStrategy\n📲 \nProducts and Services\n💶 \nRevenues, Financial Management &\nSustainability\n󰺘 \nCorporate Social Responsibility\n🤝 \nCommunity Engagement &\nCommunication\n🧑 \nTeam, Leadership, Staff & Volunteers\n󰞹 \nInnovation & Learning\n󰲇 \nLegal & Compliance\n⚠ \nInfrastructure, Risk, Security &\nResilience\nWhy a Self-Assessment?\nSelf-assessments provide rich information about organizational capacity and inform\nperformance monitoring plans. They are primarily tools for capacity strengthening\nrather than performance evaluation. A critical aspect of a participatory assessment is\nfostering a safe space where staff can freely discuss an enterprise’s issues and priorities\nwithout fear of consequences when highlighting organizational weaknesses,\nchallenges, and needs for improvement. In summary, self-assessment is a\nself-diagnosis process where an enterprise reflects on its performance, identifies\npriorities and goals, and sets a path toward achieving benchmarks. An Enterprise\nCapacity Assessment supports organizational decision-making and ownership of the\ncapacity development process.\nResults Debrief and Analysis\nThe purpose of this step is to analyze the results with the assessment group so the\nenterprise can digest and understand the results and compare its current capacity\nagainst its longer-term goals. The presentation and discussion of results should be\nnon-judgmental and positive.\nSuggested Steps:\n1. Open the session and welcome everyone\na. Explain the purpose of this meeting.\nb. Reiterate that all results are indicators rather than performance\nassessments and encourage continued active participation\n2. Discuss and analyze the results\na. Discuss each category with questions such as\ni. What is your reaction to these results? Are there any surprises?\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 8 of 41\n\nii. What are your observations about the enterprise’s overall capacity\nin this category?\niii. Are the scores for each indicator polarized or consistent with each\nother? Why?\niv. What is the enterprise doing well? What can the enterprise learn\nfrom success in this area?\nb. Summarize the discussion by highlighting the most surprising results or\neliciting the most significant difference in opinion.\n3. Reflect on the assessment results\na. Ask the participants to discuss the following questions::\ni. What are our most important issues or weaknesses as an\nenterprise?\nii. What is causing these issues?\niii. Identify key capacity issues revealed during the assessment.\niv. Look for root causes of issues, not just symptoms.\nv. Identify issues common to multiple capacity areas.\nPriority Setting and Action Planning\nThis step helps the enterprise prioritize the issues identified during the assessment for\ninclusion in the Organization's Development Plan.\nSuggested Steps:\n1. Link the problems identified with the objectives\na. Start with a discussion using these prompts\ni. Do you think any of the issues identified are more critical than\nothers? Why?\nii. Which categories or sub-categories would foster the most\nsignificant change in bringing the enterprise closer to its vision and\ngoals?\n2. Ask the participants to vote on which objective they consider priorities over\nthe next cycle and which should be in the Organization's Development Plan.\na. Explain that the number of categories or subcategories to include\ndepends on the time to implement the plan, the complexity of activities,\nand the resources required. Encourage the group to be pragmatic.\n3. Identify key results and significant initiatives for each objective.\na. What relevant milestones would your enterprise expect to achieve within\nthe program timeframe?\nHow To Apply the Organizational Development Framework:\n1. The program manager invites teams and participants to take the relevant\nOrganization Capacities assessment on the Bloom platform (Enterprise\nCapacities or Accelerator Capacities).\n2. After participants take the assessment, they are requested to go over their\nresults and discuss with their team, mentor, and program manager to select\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 9 of 41\n\ntheir priority areas of development and the particular objectives they would like\nto achieve during the program.\n3. The Organization Development Plan is documented using Bloom’s template for\nthe duration of the program and is a shared document between the teams, the\nmentors, and the program manager.\n4. Regular progress check-ins during program cycles help the team, mentors, and\nprogram managers stay on track, adjust where needed, solve problems, and\ntrack progress.\n5. Teams periodically take the assessment (whole or just for their priority\ndevelopment areas) to celebrate growth and improvements!\nKEY POINTS:\n1. The Bloom framework's second pillar is organizational development. It includes\nthe “doing” work of a person, team, or organization and the skills that help a\nteam flourish.\n2. It includes the CAT (Capacity Assessment Tool) system, with specific assessments\nusing categories and questions adapted to the needs of teams and programs.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates)\n1.

It covers the\ncritical aspects of creating and finalizing program basics.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 10 of 41\n\nProgram Design\nWe can adapt our programs to meet the partner's objectives best, whether for\neconomic development, education, impact/CSR purposes, corporate development, staff\ntraining, corporate innovation/intrapreneurship, or others. We refine each approach to\ndesign the best program to deliver the desired results.\nSome program design parameters include\n● \nNumber of Teams: Varies by partner\n○ \nWe aim to have twice as many teams in the sprint phase as a general rule\n● \nTeam Composition: Varies by partner\n○ \nWe generally recommend having at least two team members actively\nworking on the enterprise though it varies depending on enterprise stage.\n● \nEnterprise Stage: From pre-idea, concept/idea stage, startup, or established\nenterprise.\nEnterprise Development Stages\nStages Sub-Stages\n0. LEARNING \n0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1. IDEATION \n1.1. Want to start and looking for/testing ideas\n2. IDEA-STAGE \n2.1. Exploring ideas, conducting market/customer research\n2.2. Have started developing my idea\n3. PROTOTYPE \n3.1. Have an early (low-fidelity/paper) prototype (of product or service)\n3.2. Have a functioning (high-fidelity) prototype with early users / early adopters\n4. EARLY-STAGE \n4.1. Declining revenues and the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.2. Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but the enterprise is not yet\nprofitable/sustainable\n4.3. Revenues are multiplying, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n5. GROWTH-STAGE \n5.1. Profitable/sustainable business\n5.2. Seeking scalability (of impact and profits)\n5.3. Seeking diversification\n5.4. Seeking an exit\n5.5. Established national enterprise\n5.6. Established multinational enterprise\n● \nGeography: Varies by partner\n○ \nWithin an internal accelerator/entrepreneurship program or across the\nUAE, GCC, MENA, or global.\n● \nFunding to Teams: Varies by partner\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 11 of 41\n\n● \nImpact Areas: Varies by partner\n○ \nGenerally aligned with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) or for\nother impact purposes.\n● \nOther criteria: To determine with a partner.\nDefinition of success and program results\nBased on the objectives of the accelerator program, program managers and\naccelerators can get results to measure the program’s success. We list some later in this\nguide, but discussing them while building and designing your program is also helpful.\nThe accelerator program work plan will set the tone for program results. Each objective\nset is measurable and timely and allows for a quantifiable measurement of success.\nAdditionally, impact metrics can be measured depending on the program objectives,\nincluding but not limited to jobs created, revenues generated, new product launches,\nand more.\nProgram Communications\nDeveloping a solid brand is critical in attracting enterprises and other stakeholders.\nChoosing the best enterprises will lead to good results, attract good investors, and\nreliable applications. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the\nprogram’s criteria, what it offers, and to whom is critical. Creating a content strategy\nshould be the first step.\nA content strategy is a plan of action purposely designed to guide content marketing\nactivities and ensure they deliver against a specific objective. It includes content\nplanning, production, publishing, promoting, tracking, and SEO optimization. It also\nconsists of content you produce, such as videos, blog posts, podcasts, and social media\nposts.\nYou can see a sample content plan here: \nHerMeNow Communications Plan (draft)\nSample draft posts for this campaign here: \nHerMeNow posts\nThe idea is to ensure that each piece of content you produce resonates heavily with\nyour target audience and serves to rally people behind your program’s objectives.\nSome questions to consider at this stage:\n1. Which channels or events would be relevant for marketing your particular\nprogram?\n2. Which networks would be most effective for reaching the type of enterprises\nyou’d like to work with?\n3. How could you communicate the criteria for your program?\nTarget Audience\nAccelerator programs must create a compelling offer to attract the most promising\nentrepreneurs.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 12 of 41\n\nAccelerators can engage with multiple organizations, stakeholders, and channels to\nsource and attract startups. These include\n1. Referral from entrepreneurs affiliated with the accelerator\n2. Investors\n3. Entrepreneurial associations\n4. Universities\n5. Industry Association\n6. Sector-specific conferences\n7. Inbound requests from marketing efforts and social media\n8. Outbound direct recruiting by finding and contacting entrepreneurs on the web.\nThe quality of applications is far more critical than quantity. Attracting enterprises\nwithout growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom the accelerator has nothing to\noffer will be useless.\nPlanning, roles, and timeline\nWe train others to run high-impact enterprise development support programs that\nleverage online and in-person engagement. Every program we design has the\nbelow-standard program stages.\nOnce you agree with the partner on the program parameters, you can start designing\nthe program.\nSee the toolkit at the end of this stage for the program design and planning templates.\nMentor Engagement\nMentorship is a cornerstone of growth in entrepreneurship and leadership, offering\ninvaluable guidance, support, and networking opportunities. We do not pay our\nmentors to foster a culture of altruism, shared learning, and community engagement,\nwhich are critical for building resilient entrepreneurial ecosystems.\nResearch shows that intrinsically motivated mentors provide higher-quality guidance\nand derive greater satisfaction from mentoring. Effective mentorship builds social\ncapital, creating networks of trust and reciprocity that benefit both mentors and\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 13 of 41\n\nmentees. Non-financial incentives, such as recognition, personal growth, and the\nopportunity to give back, lead to more committed and impactful mentoring\nrelationships.\nMentors also benefit through reciprocal learning, staying updated with new trends, and\ngaining fresh perspectives, which enhances their leadership skills. By not monetarily\ncompensating mentors, we emphasize the mutual benefits of mentorship grounded in\nintrinsic motivation and community spirit.\nA quality mentoring program is crucial for reducing the risk of enterprise failure and is a\ncritical component of successful accelerators. We attract a diverse range of mentors\nwith domain knowledge and entrepreneurial experience, offering two types of\nmentorship:\n1. Key Mentors: The principal mentor for a team in our programs. Program\nmanagers match you with an enterprise based on your preference and the\nneeds of the business. You will follow the company throughout the program,\nmeeting (online) 1-2 times per month and offering support and guidance when\nneeded.\n2. Topic Mentors: Topic Mentors support teams in specific areas of expertise (e.g.,\nmarketing, HR, etc.).\nOur mentor selection is based on referrals and direct applications, focusing on\nextensive entrepreneurial experience rather than academic credentials. We prioritize\nmentors interested in practical implementation and immediate progress, ensuring that\nmentoring sessions are action-oriented and impactful.\nTeams and mentors can keep track of their meetings and progress using the “mentor\njournal” template: \nMentorship Journal for [Team Name]\nAny program needs to be monitored and assessed. The quality of mentorship can be\nevaluated through feedback surveys that the enterprises complete. This information is\npart of a feedback loop that allows constant improvement in the mentorship process.\nPartner Engagement\nThe partners’ building block consists of the network of suppliers and partners that\nmakes the business model work.\nA successful partnership is most likely to occur when partners lay out clear guidelines\nat the very start. You are working with each other because partners/NGOs bring\nsomething unique and distinctive. So there must be a clear articulation of the end goal\nregarding the impact and the fundamental guiding principles that will keep the\nrelationship together.\nThese include monitoring mechanisms, reporting requirements, expectations\nregarding shared resources and engagement levels, mutually agreed-upon\ncommunication strategies, an exit plan if things go wrong, etc.\nWe usually have the following partnerships:\n1. Outreach partners:\na. Community engagement and outreach\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 14 of 41\n\nb. Engaging your community online and offline (including Facebook,\nInstagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter networks, along with the newsletters and\nwebsite) to help us source enterprises for the program.\n2. Knowledge partners:\na. Help provide mentors, trainers, or experts in relevant sectors or\nstartup/enterprise development areas\nb. Conducting online workshops (ranging from 2 hours to multi-day\nworkshops; preferably recorded sessions), providing mentorship for\nparticipating impact startups, helping make relevant connections, etc.\n3. Ecosystem partners:\na. Support for participating projects during the program or downstream\nb. They provide additional support, resources, perks, or opportunities to the\nparticipating enterprises, whether during or after the program, such as\ninvestment/grants, partnerships/contracts, conference/visibility, services,\netc.\nKEY POINTS:\nTo prepare for launch, program managers need to consider the following:\n1. Target audience and stage of enterprises\n2. Definition of success and program KPIs\n3. Essential program communication\n4. Staffing, roles, and timeline\n5. Mentor engagement\n6. Partner engagement\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates)\n● \nProgram Design Template\n● \nProgram Planning Template v2\n● \nMentorship Journal for [Team Name]\n● \nPartner MOU - All Categories - TEMPLATE\nLEARN MORE: (external resources)\n● \nSTARTUP ACCELERATOR PROGRAMMES A Practice Guide\n● \nThe Mentor Manifesto: The original “Mentor Manifesto,” created by David Cohen\nwith the help of Jon Bradford and Brad Feld, outlines a set of principles\nsupported by years of accelerator work and thousands of mentor interactions.\n● \nDeconstructing the Mentor Manifesto: Brad Feld goes in depth through each\ncomponent of the manifesto.\nStage 1: Outreach & Open House\nThe program starts with an Open House period. It refers to when a team becomes\naware of the existence of an accelerator program. The accelerator’s success in this\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 15 of 41\n\nphase depends on the strength of its brand and how it markets itself. The Open House\nevents are typically virtual and open to the public.\nOur Open Houses are a way to ask questions and get answers. You can join virtually to\nlearn more about learning to grow in our accelerator programs and build connections.\nAs a result, teams leave with a better understanding of our program and if it may be a\ngood fit for them.\nOpen House Events\nDuring these 4-6 weeks, we host online webinars featuring prominent speakers sharing\ntheir experiences with aspiring entrepreneurs. It is also a space for applicants to meet\nand start forming a community. Here are some blog posts recapping previous\nopen-house events.\nThere are four main reasons to run an Open House:\n1. Attract, vet, and prepare applicants\na. Did we attract the quality and quantity of intended teams?\nb. Identify participants that may be appropriate for an online program and\nthis program.\nc. Help people become more familiar with the tools and approaches of the\nprogram.\n2. Bring visibility to the program and the partner.\na. Program managers can record each open house event and transform it\ninto a blog post to share on social media to attract more applicants.\nb. Recorded events become part of a shareable library of content accessible\nto the Bloom community.\n3. Inspire and educate the potential applicants\na. The topics for the open house events are timely and relevant to the\ncurrent situation to help the applicants learn something new about their\ntrade.\nb. The events are an opportunity for the program managers to present the\nprogram and for the applicants to ask questions.\n4. Bring visibility to Bloom and engage/strengthen the Bloom community\n(mentors, broader startups, partners, etc.)\na. Engaging the mentors by asking them to participate as speakers\nb. Engaging the partners by inviting them and asking them to intervene\nc. Showcasing startups that have been in the program previously\nApplication Form\nChoosing which enterprises to select is one of the essential factors in the success of any\naccelerator. While attracting the entrepreneurs to the Open House events, we place\nthem in a marketing funnel to submit to the second stage of the application process.\nThis stage includes demographic information and details about the enterprise.\nDepending on your program, you can select different criteria, such as\n1. Demographic Data\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 16 of 41\n\na. Gender\nb. Age\nc. Location\nd. Nationality\n2. Information about the enterprise/startup:\na. Website and social media links\nb.

Areas of development: Enterprise Capacities dropdown\ng. Traction\nh. Size of team\ni. Investment Raised\nj. Registration Status\nIt is essential to keep in mind that the quality of applications is far more critical than\nquantity. Attracting enterprises without growth potential or entrepreneurs for whom\nthe accelerator has nothing to offer will be useless. Targeted marketing and clear\ncommunication about the program’s criteria, what it provides, and to whom are critical.\nSummarized list of things to prepare:\n1. Brevo Registration Form\n2.

In a nutshell, it’s a way for teams to spend a\nfixed amount of time on core enterprise development using today’s best practices in a\ncoherent, integrated fashion.\nWe also sometimes run longer versions of Sprints that we call Bootcamps, usually\nbetween 4-8 weeks long. The key difference lies in the number of sessions:\n1. A Sprint is two weeks long and include 6 sessions (3 sessions per week) plus a\nDemo Day\n2. A Bootcamp can vary between 4 to 8 weeks:\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 18 of 41\n\na. A 4 week Bootcamp has 3 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo\nDay\nb. An 8 week Bootcamp has 6 sessions (one session per week) plus a Demo\nDay\nIn Bloom’s standard programs, the Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives:\n1. To help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise.\n2. To help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the\nAccelerator.\nWe’ve found that we learn more about the people and projects through a short\nprogram than through an application process and interviews. So here is how we do it:\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp allows us to assess enterprises’ strengths as we look for\nentrepreneurs who can overcome the obstacles necessary to build a great business.\nThis phase helps us get to know and understand why teams have an unfair advantage\nover all the other candidates.\nSelection from Open House to Sprint/Bootcamp\nFirst, we disqualify candidates who do not check all eligibility criteria. Then, a selection\ncommittee will score the selection against the following scoring matrix.\nEligibility Assessing whether the application fits the program's\neligibility criteria.\nYES / NO\nTeam \nAssessing the team’s background, capabilities to execute,\nand ability to gain and contribute to the program. \n/ 10\nImpact &\nInclusion\nDoes the enterprise have a social impact? Can it create jobs?\nDoes it have a positive impact on marginalized and\nvulnerable communities?\n/ 10\nValue\nProposition\nIs the team tackling a real problem and offering a valuable\nsolution? Does it have the ability to grow and be\nsustainable? Is the market potential attractive?\n/ 10\nMilestones &\nTraction\nCan the idea generate revenues? Have they achieved\nsignificant milestones? Has the team demonstrated it can\ncompete?\n/ 5\nStrategy &\nChallenges\nDo they have a clear growth strategy? Is the program able\nto support the team in its current challenges?\n/ 5\nOverall\nPassion\nBased on the team's strength, the project, and the potential\nimpact it can create: how passionate are you about this\napplication?\n/ 10\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 19 of 41\n\nSprint/Bootcamp Session Objectives\nOutlined below are some of the frameworks and tools we use during the Sprint session\nto help the enterprises progress on their goals and improve at least one aspect of their\nenterprise during the Sprint/Bootcamp sessions.\n1. Discovering your Why: How do you talk about what you do?\nThe Golden Circle is a concept developed by Simon Sinek, who says, “people don’t buy\nwhat you do. They buy why you do it.”\nAccording to Sinek, most people communicate by starting with the “what” they do and\neventually work their way back to talk about “how” and “why” they do what they do.\nBut companies universally identified as unique and successful think Apple or Google\ncommunicate with an “inside-out” type of thinking.\nThey start with the why, and only then do they talk about the how and what portions of\nwhat they do.\nTo use the Golden Circle for your enterprise, just help them answer three simple\nquestions:\nWhy – Why are you doing what you are doing? For example, why are you in business,\nand why did you develop your product or service?\nHow – How will this help your readers? For example, what problems are you solving for\nyour readers, and what challenges are you helping them overcome?\nWhat – What are you offering? For example, what is your product or service, and what\nare its features and benefits?\n2. Assessing: What are your priorities for the upcoming period?\nProgram managers invite the teams to take the assessments to reflect on their\nindividual and organizational development. After reflecting on their results in their\nteams, program managers invite them to discuss them with their peers and mentors\nand start thinking about their core priority areas of development.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 20 of 41\n\n3. Goal setting: What are your objectives for the duration of the accelerator?\nWe provide the enterprises with a framework to specify their objectives for the\nupcoming period they spend with us during the accelerator, usually three to four\nmonths. The enterprises must accompany these objectives with measurable key results\nassigned to specific team members for accountability. The enterprise can further break\ndown objectives into particular initiatives and key activities. We recommend that\nenterprises work on at least one objective and up to three objectives for the duration of\nthe accelerator. Each objective must relate to a particular organizational development\ntopic they identified while reflecting on their priorities.\nWe invite teams to develop an Organization Development Plan stating their main\nobjective related to their core area of organizational development. We also consider\ntheir signature character strength and overall well-being for the program duration.\nTeams will also develop this Organization Development Plan with a budget to help the\nBloom team assess the needs accordingly.\n4. Budgeting: How will you use the funds allocated for the accelerator?\nWe provide enterprises with a budgeting tool to help them think about allocating their\nfunds to the accelerator program. It allows them to think strategically about their\nobjectives and goals, given their plans earlier during the week around the objectives\nand key results they aim to achieve. Funds are allocated to specific categories to help us\nalign the overall budgets and work on economies of scale.\n5. Pitching: How will you combine this using the Pitch Deck template?\nA pitch deck is usually a 5-10 slide presentation designed to summarize the company,\nthe business plan, and the vision. The pitch presentation deck also serves different\npurposes, from meeting with a new investor to presenting in front of a stage. Each of\nthem should follow a different structure. A demo day presentation, for example, should\nbe very visual and contain very little text, as the entrepreneur will do all the talking.\nWe provide enterprises with a 5-10 slide deck template to adapt their branding and\ncontent accordingly.\nSelection from Sprint/Bootcamp to Accelerator\nThe program aims to help participants transform personally, professionally, and\nprofessionally.\nTo be fair, we have a 2-step process:\nStep 1: Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges\n● \nFor the Sprint/Bootcamp phase, judges decide whether a team advances based\non the team’s pitches during the online Demo Day.\n● \nWe enlist the services of expert volunteer “Judges” who are independent and\nobjective, with no conflicts of interest.\n● \nThese judges review team pitches and determine each team’s potential for\nlong-term success based on the judge’s experience and the quality of the team’s\npitch during the demo day.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 21 of 41\n\n● \nJudging will take place during the online Demo Day on Zoom.\n● \nProgram managers will share the link to submit scores with all judges before the\nDemo Day event.\n● \nIf too many teams are at the end of the Sprint/Bootcamp (15 or more), it might\nbe difficult to pitch in one group. In this case, we could split the pitch day into\nmultiple simultaneous sessions, with up to 10 teams in a breakout session and a\nseparate judging panel per breakout room. Representatives from each breakout\nsession judging panel will be part of the Accelerator Selection Panel.\n● \nWe also invite the teams to share feedback on all the pitches, though we\ncalculate the scoring separately.\nStep 2: Accelerator Selection Panel\n● \nPrimarily a subset of the Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges\n● \nThe Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day Judges' feedback will be summarized, along\nwith the Sprint/Bootcamp Scoring Template, and shared with the Accelerator\nSelection Panel, which will do a final review and selection in the days following\nthe Sprint/Bootcamp Demo Day.\nAccelerator Selection Criteria\nWe measure the principles for selection with the following assessments:\nEvaluation\nArea\nDescription Weight\nEffort The teams have a significant say in advancing to the next stage\nbased on their effort during the Sprint/Bootcamp. We measure\nthe effort according to attendance, feedback participation, and\ndeliverables.\n1/4\nSupport The teams are also scored based on how supportive they are to\nthe other teams in the Sprint/Bootcamp.\n1/4\nCoachability The team is receptive to receiving constructive criticism and will\nuse that feedback and constructive criticism to improve their\nprofessional and organizational performance.\n1/4\nDemo Day\nScore\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp ends with a Demo Day where the\nenterprises pitch online, and judging will occur between\npresentations. The Judging panel will include mentors and\ntrainers from the program and independent experts from the\necosystem.\n1/4\nThe Judges’ scores (Demo Day Score) and the Bloom team scores (Effort, Support, and\nCoachability) are shared with a selection panel composed of Bloom and External\nExperts for deliberations and donor representatives. The panel will make the final\nselection for acceptance in addition to the validation of support required per team.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 22 of 41\n\nKEY POINTS:\nThe Sprint/Bootcamp has two main objectives:\n1. First, to help teams learn new skills and progress in their enterprise.\n2. To help us learn more about the teams during our selection process for the\nAccelerator.\nThe following frameworks guide the participants during the Sprint/Bootcamp phase:\n1. The elevator pitch using the golden circle framework\n2. Personal, professional, and organizational assessments\n3. Goal Setting\n4. Budgeting\n5. Preparing for the demo day\nThe selection process includes:\n1. Selecting for the Sprint/Bootcamp based on eligibility and scoring for success\nusing metrics defined by program objectives\n2. Selecting for the accelerator, based on the demo day scoring and scores for\neffort, community, and results\nTOOLKIT: (diagnostic assessments, checklists, models, templates)\n1.

Refine their dashboards and align their objectives and initiatives with the\nEnterprise Capacities categories, keeping in mind the below\nrecommendations:\na. The enterprise's objectives should align with its overall objective for the\nprogram.\nb. The objectives are achievable within the timeframe of the program.\nc. Each objective has a key result that should be measurable with a starting\nvalue and a target value that measures progress toward an objective.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 23 of 41\n\nd. Each initiative aligns with the set category and topics.\ne. The “enterprise development topics” for initiatives are valid and aligned\nwith the “enterprise development category” for the related objective.\nf. The enterprise might be unsure how to match its objectives with the\n“enterprise development category.” The program manager can help them\nrefine their dashboard during these one-on-ones\n2. Help the teams add their priorities on the platform\na. Once the dashboards are clear for the team and the program manager,\nthe team will log on to the platform and start adding their priorities:\ni. The team navigates to the Growth page.\nii. The team selects their priority area per their dashboard (the\n“Enterprise Development Category” for their first objective).\niii. In the “add goal details” text box, the team adds their objective, key\nresults, and initiatives\n3. Explain the individual assessments to the teams, help them identify their\nsignature character strength, and select their priority areas for skills\na. The program manager will explain the individual assessments:\ni. The teams can take the Character Strength Assessment on the\nBloom Platform and identify their “Signature Strength.” It is a\nstrength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people\nenergy when used rather than taking effort. Using our Signature\nStrengths can help us bring energy and promote well-being at\nwork. Once they do that, they should add their Signature Strength\non their dashboard so we can support them in leveraging it during\nthe program.\nii. Teams can take the Universal Skills and Entrepreneurship &\nLeadership Skills assessment on the Bloom platform to identify\nareas of improvement. In discussions with peers, mentors, and\nprogram managers, they can identify & improve individual growth\npriorities and select activities for development from online\nresources or the Bloom Library of Activities.\nCustomizing the Curriculum\nWe strive to adapt the curriculum to each new cohort of enterprises that best caters to\ntheir needs. We base this customization on inputs from the Growth Page on the\nplatform:\nOnce we complete the onboarding process, we have a clear view of all the teams’\npriorities and objectives for the duration of the program, allowing us to customize the\ncurriculum accordingly.\n1. The Assessment results of each enterprise: We look at priorities selected\nduring the onboarding and the score trends in each category.\n2. The Team's Organization Development Plans: We look at the specific objective\nand initiatives to understand what they aim to achieve.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 24 of 41\n\nAt this stage, the program manager and the training manager can design the\ncohort-based training activities that the teams will do during the program and prepare\nfor the first session of the accelerator program.\nWhile we aim to find commonalities between all the teams, it is never possible to cater\nto everyone’s needs. Once we set the common needs, we reach out to the teams with\nindividual needs to help them identify training activities they can do at their own pace\nand get feedback from mentors and trainers individually.\nLearning by Doing\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is nothing more important than “doing” and\n“testing” to understand the product, customers, and business model. At Bloom, we\nknow how much theory we introduce to entrepreneurs versus how much time we give\nthem to achieve results. Teaching entrepreneurs theory is inevitable — it is crucial to\nunderstand the context — but we make sure that every idea comes with a framework\nor a tool that entrepreneurs can use and develop over time to achieve their goals. These\ntools make robust theories actionable. Once we introduce them to our program, we\nmake an effort to revisit them during the program over and over again, in the best spirit\nof lean startup methodology, so we make sure we are helping the startups drive\nprogress and results.\nModular Learning\nModular learning, as the word connotes, uses learning modules that facilitate\nentrepreneurs learning by themselves. It is a form of distance learning that uses\nSelf-Learning Modules based on the essential learning competencies developed by the\ntrainers with the aid of the program and training manager.\nWhen there’s teaching, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and show\nthem what they need to know. But GALI found that “the more remote work we allow,\nthe better.” For example, indirect learning, which focuses on the student’s inquiry and\nexploration rather than the teacher’s instruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while\nworking on their business plans and product.\nAccelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do remotely that\nserve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and helping advance the startup. It\nis better to use the time to build relationships and get feedback. Online education with\ne-learning modules allows founders to spend more time building networks and\nproducts.\nOnce the teams complete the training activity, we invite them to share their work in the\ncommunity to get feedback from their peers and program managers. They will then\njoin an online training session to get further feedback from their peers and expert\ntrainers.\nKEY POINTS:\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 25 of 41\n\n1. Curriculums are customized according to teams’ Enterprise Capacities results,\nOrganization Development Plan, surveys, and one-on-one interviews to identify\nthe most present needs\n2. Content is created well before training sessions so entrepreneurs can learn at\ntheir own pace, apply their learning on homework, templates, and tools, and get\nfeedback in sessions with the trainers.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates)\n● \nProgram Planning Template v2\n● \nBloom Digital Library\nStage 4: Accelerator\nBloom Accelerator Programs Principles\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator programs.\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to engaging,\napplying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical thinking that\ncombines reflection and action.\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to record their\ndaily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board.\nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or a group\nrather than the negative ones. This approach builds on the entrepreneurs’ strengths,\nspecifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when in adverse conditions.\nStrengths are integral to our human identity, constituting the intrinsic and inherent\nqualities that define us as individuals. However, few are conscious and appreciative of\nthem or particular about how we can best put them to use to achieve desired\noutcomes.\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute discretionary effort\ntowards attaining their goals. At the same time, it nourishes a feeling of achievement\nbecause they perform the things they are best at doing. Research indicates that when\nindividuals use their strengths, they feel happier, more confident and proud, and more\nengaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense of\nresilience in achieving their goals.\nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal assessments to\nidentify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them through our library of\nactivities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we developed the Enterprise\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 26 of 41\n\nCapacity Assessment to measure the organizational capacity of enterprises. It allows us\nto have the whole picture of the strengths of both the entrepreneur and the enterprise.\nGrowth Mindset: 1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days.\nA growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of\nunintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our existing\nabilities. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work,\ngood strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. As a result, they tend to\nachieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are\ninnate gifts). It is because they worry less about looking bright and put more energy\ninto learning.\nStriving to get 1% better daily is a core tenet of the growth mindset principle. This\nsystem encourages action by breaking down big, overwhelming goals into small,\ndiscrete pieces. The small successes you experience with your baby steps feed on each\nother and start building momentum, leading to more prominent and significant\nmoves.\nWe encourage our entrepreneurs to try to do just 1% better than the day before. Start\nsmall and make your increases gradual. Avoid the temptation to get impatient and\nstart rushing forward and taking more significant leaps. Take it slow, steady, and\nconsistent.\nSimply try to do a little better than you did the day before. Daily, just focus on getting\n1% better in whatever you try to improve. That’s it. Just 1%. It might not seem like much,\nbut those 1% improvements compound each other.\nBloom Tools: Our programs encourage entrepreneurs to look at their weekly power\nmoves. Power Moves are the moves that take us out of our comfort zone and push us\nforward. Those exhilarating first steps allow us to make many more steps. Power Moves\ntake you right out of your regularly scheduled program. They are the key to real change.\nThey’re the most critical task that will take you one step closer to your goal.\nStep by Step: Pick a target, make it tractable, get to it, and review it.\nBreaking projects down into their parts is oft-repeated advice when tackling\nsomething big. Breaking tasks down helps us see large tasks as more approachable\nand doable and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or defer tasks because we\nsimply don’t know where to begin.\nEntrepreneurs should break down the tasks to a point where they can produce a\nreliable estimate. Each key objective should have a clearly defined task or set of tasks.\nTasks should be between 8 and 80 person-hours of labor. It is a manageable amount.\nBloom Tools: We ask our teams to prepare an Organization Development Plan that\nincludes at least one and up to three critical objectives tied into key results and broken\ndown into significant activities or tasks. It allows us to understand what the enterprise\nintends to accomplish during the accelerator period. Additionally, we encourage\nenterprises to use the Bloom Taskboard to record their daily tasks and keep track of\ntheir progress to accomplish what they’ve planned within their set deadlines.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 27 of 41\n\nCommunity: We grow best when we grow together.\nWe rarely grow alone. Being part of an engaging community gives us a sense of\nbelonging. It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual\ngrowth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part of a community can\nmake us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. Providing unique\nopportunities for people to learn from each other and support and encouragement are\ninvaluable in joining forces with our peers.\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises, starting with:\n● \nThe teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other members.\nSupportive of others will help them feel good and better about themselves.\n● \nThe mentors: An open bond with new connections builds valuable relationships\nand gives us a more profound sense of belonging. It helps us to reach our goals\nand brings a sense of security.\n● \nThe module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a unique\nresource, and through its use, it increases in value.\nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of learning\nand feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback from their mentors,\nand then the module leaders give feedback.\nThe general architecture of a cycle\nBloom cycles takes the best from agile and design thinking methodologies used at\nleading innovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint and accelerator\nprograms to help teams develop their startup while learning leading productivity\ntechniques.\nCycle repetitions can include some of the below elements:\nActivities and Reflections\n● \nWeekly activities: Every other Tuesday, the program manager invites the teams\nto start new training activities and share their progress in the community\n● \nEnd-of-month reflections: At the end of each month, we send the teams a\nreflection and feedback form to understand and gauge their progress on several\nKPIs related to the program’s focus.\nLive online events\n● \nTraining sessions: Each cycle will have 2-4 training activities whereby teams will\nreceive resources, including videos, tools, frameworks, and worksheets, to\nprepare them for the training sessions, where the module leader will facilitate an\ninteractive exchange of knowledge and expertise.\n● \nMentor support: We invite mentors to join a speed mentoring session to\nfacilitate mentor matching. Once we match them, we invite the teams and\nmentors to set their meeting frequency throughout the accelerator, where they\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 28 of 41\n\nfollow up on the enterprise’s progress, approve their budget, help them with\ntheir hiring needs, and others as needed.\nTypical Schedule of an Acceleration Program\nCurriculum co-creation and onboarding (1 week, two sessions).\n● \nSession 1: Based on the onboarding sessions, we identify the cohort-based\ntraining activities of the accelerator program and present them with the\nmodules they commit to achieving. We will put them in the driver's seat from\nday one, allowing us to identify standard modules & group them into sessions\ntackling the same topics in cohort-based activities and individual modules they\nare interested in tackling separately according to their enterprise needs. We also\nintroduce them to the grant disbursement process and deep dive into best\npractices to plan their financial journey and ensure they are not delayed.\n● \nSession 2: We invite the teams and mentors to join for a mentor matching\nsession where each team meets at least three mentors. Based on their feedback\nforms filled at the end of the session, we will facilitate the matching for the\nduration of the accelerator.\nWeekly training and support (12-16 weeks, 12-16 group training sessions,\nand two to four individual mentorship sessions per team).\nBased on our program feedback in the last two years, we have adjusted the weekly\nsupport to cater to our teams' needs and rhythms. We build a panel of 4-5 trainers who\ncan give general feedback on several modules in our new approach. A trainer joins in\nevery weekly session with up to five teams at once to have enough time for deep\ndiscussions.\nDuring the weekly sessions, the teams can share what they’ve learned during the\nmodule and discuss their work related to their projects. They will receive feedback from\ntheir peers, trainers, and program managers to improve further (inverted feedback\npyramid).\nIn addition, teams can book up to 4 follow-up one-on-one meetings with the trainers,\nmentors, and coaches to deepen the hands-on feedback further, mentoring and\ncoaching experience at the individual and team levels.\nBased on the teams' assessment results, the curriculum will be co-created during the\nonboarding. After the co-creation sessions, we will select trainers, mentors, and\nbusiness coaches from our Mentors and Trainers databases.\nDepending on each team’s core priorities, the curriculum might include topics that\ntackle questions such as\n● \nBranding\n○ \nDo we build our brand effectively?\n● \nProblem Solving\n○ \nHow strong is our mission?\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 29 of 41\n\n○ \nHave we identified what value we deliver to our customers with\nwell-defined and aligned products and services?\n● \nSolution Definition\n○ \nHave we identified relevant social responsibility factors for our business\nand industry, and are the social responsibility principles integrated into\nthe overall corporate strategy?\n● \nTarget Market\n○ \nHave we clearly defined who we are creating value for and who our most\nimportant customers are?\n○ \nDo we have clear strategies and channels to reach our customers?\n● \nBasic Revenue Model\n○ \nDo we have solid financial plans and clear financial performance\nindicators?\n○ \nAre our revenue streams clearly defined, and how effective is our revenue\ngeneration model?\n● \nMilestones and Next Steps\n○ \nDo we regularly read and stay on top of global business and industry\ntrends?\n○ \nDo we have a coherent organizational strategy, including mission, vision,\nvalues, and operational plan?\n● \nTeam\n○ \nDo we have diverse and highly skilled staff?\n○ \nAre our people (the organization's leadership and staff) satisfied and\nmotivated in their work?\n○ \nDo we have a learning culture?\n○ \nDo we have the right people and resources (e.g., tools, budget) to provide\nour products/services?\nWhile some of those topics might already exist in the Bloom Digital Library, we could\nalso commission trainers to develop additional training content if we find a gap that\nneeds to be filled.\nWe send thank you emails to trainers after they complete the cycle to share gratitude.\nAsync accountability on the Bloom platform\nTeams can schedule mentors' sessions at their convenience, tracked on the community\nof the Bloom platform by posting a reflection on their notes from their mentorship\njournals. Teams also submit assignments to the community to hold each other\nresponsible and accountable for the module they chose to take at the beginning of the\nprogram. Finally, the program manager will encourage the teams to review their peers’\nwork and give constructive and generous feedback. Indeed by looking at the same\nchallenge from a different perspective, they are encouraged to unlearn and relearn.\nGrant Disbursement Process\nThe Grant Disbursement process will vary slightly depending on the enterprise stage\nand the grant amount.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 30 of 41\n\nFor earlier-stage enterprises (not registered), the agreement and invoice are with\nindividuals rather than enterprises.\nWe can apply the same basic steps to all programs:\n1. Enterprises sign the Agreement:\na. Program managers adapt the program agreement template and invite\nthe teams to make a copy.\nb. Teams complete and sign the agreement by adding a digital signature as\nan image in the document.\n2. Enterprises refine the budget:\na. The objectives and key initiatives in the work plan should be related to the\nbudget developed for the grant.\nb. 70-80% of the budget is for capacity building instead of running costs.\n3. Enterprises get the budget approved:\na. Enterprises work on improving it with their mentor and program\nmanager.\nb. Once ready and approved, the Mentor + Program manager adds their\ninitials and the date approved on the budget.\n4. Enterprises get the budget signed:\na. The enterprises sign the budget in the designated cell by uploading a\ndigital signature as an image in the cell.\nb. The Program Manager, Finance Officer, and Program Lead sign the\nbudget.\n5. The enterprises send us an invoice for the amount (from the Enterprise to AltCity\nImpact)\na. Specific account information to include in the invoice varies:\ni. For programs disbursing from the Lebanon bank account, we\ninclude the below:\nAltCity Impact / Bloom\nBeirut, Lebanon\nMOF: 3241751 (Ministry of Finance number)\nEmail: accts@bloom.pm\nDescription: Grant disbursement / Project reference: [Name\nof the program]\nii.

For enterprises not yet registered, we will release the second tranche of the grant\nbased on the progress achieved on the objectives set in the organizational\ndevelopment plan.\n2. For registered enterprises, after receiving the first tranche, the enterprise sends\nall the proof of payments (invoices/bills/photos) and an updated variance report\nthat needs to align with the Approved Budget with the next invoice for the next\ntranche.\nProcurement Process for Registered Enterprises\nThis process applies to registered enterprises receiving grants larger than 2,000 USD.\nPlease watch this video for detailed information: Procurement Process\n1. Quotations:\na. $500 - $1,000: Quotation must be sent to AltCity Impact finance team as\nsupporting document for the coming tranches.\nb. $1,001 and above: 3 quotations must be presented along with a quotation\nanalysis form clearly stating the selection criteria and the selected\nsupplier.\n2.

Main presentation event: Zoom (can be streamed from Zoom onto Facebook\nLive if preferred)\n2. Networking with team tables: Remo, Airmeet\n3. All event slides and slide decks are compiled into one presentation: Google Slides\nTips:\n1. Have each team have their timer on their end, so they track their own time and\nstop on time. Make sure to inform the teams before the session on their pitch\nduration so that they practice accordingly. The goal is to prevent the moderator\nfrom cutting them off publicly, but it is also essential to be strict about keeping\nto the time limit (possibly with a 10-15 second buffer, max).\n2. The presentation order, tables, and list order on any forms should all be\nnumbered and aligned precisely the same way.\n3. Have the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and\n“presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the\naudience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that\nadditional information added.\n4. Have different staff/team members moderating, time-keeping, making\nslides/music, etc. Split up roles so nobody is multitasking too much.\n5. If technical limitations make it challenging to give the presenters the ability to\ncontrol the shared screen, have all the teams presenting snap their fingers, so\nthey don’t have to keep saying “next” out loud.\n6. The person presenting should turn their video off if the sound is glitchy. Most\nimportantly, their voice and the slides, though seeing them speaking would also\nbe lovely if possible.\n7. Everyone turns on their microphones at the end to clap for all the teams. :-)\nMaybe we even do that during the opening “tadaa” to hear everyone’s voice. It is\nnice to do at the closing of the event as well.\n8. Encourage teams to present standing up, not sitting down, so they need to set\nup their laptop (and headphones) in a way that would allow that and not have\nthat be at an awkward angle.\n9. Encourage all teams to use headphones for better sound quality.\n10. Encourage all teams to do some warm-up exercises before the presentation. For\nexample, super-hero pose, jumping jacks, stretching, running in place, dance,\n“coffee breathing,” etc.\n11. Make things easy for people to switch between Zoom and Remo; create\nonboarding videos to share with all attendees ahead of time, and encourage\nthem to join Remo / and sign me.\n12. Encourage teams a week in advance to start inviting their family/friends/future\ninvestors.\n13. All teams put their username/screen name as “Team Name - Full Name.”\n14. Use zoom dual monitors > Show participants screen\n15. Encourage teams to practice, practice, practice!\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 34 of 41\n\n16. Hype up the teams! :-)\nSlide Preparation for an Online Demo Day\n1. Having a smooth flow between presentations is vital. Having all presentations in\none Google Slides presentation can improve the flow substantially.\na. If possible, test ahead of time. You can give participants the ability to\ncontrol the person sharing the screen. It will allow each speaker to control\nthe slides themselves. However, it often doesn’t work as smoothly in\npractice because of technical issues, internet delays, or little comfort with\nthe online tools.\n2. Advanced Google Docs users can have the teams use separate presentations\nlinked to one master presentation. For example, when copy-pasting from a team\npresentation into the main presentation, choose “linked slides.” This way, when\nthe teams update their presentations (just those slides), the master presentation\nis automatically linked.\na. Tip: Once a presentation is in “present mode,” new changes will not show.\nIt may be best to have an organizer “own” the team’s presentations to\nremove the team’s ability to edit by a particular deadline.\n3. Have the team name, presenter’s name, team members' names, and\n“presentation number” of the last team on the slide to stay visible to the\naudience while scoring. Perhaps it could be the team’s title slide with that\nadditional information added.\n4. Make sure all teams send in a recorded pitch video before the session, just in\ncase a team was unable to attend the demo day for any reason (medical,\nemergency..) or even for reasons such as having terrible internet connection and\nbeing unable to connect and join the demo day. Share the folder of “recorded\npitch videos” with all the programs team and facilitators.\nKEY POINTS:\nOnline demo days can be as effective as in-person. There are different ways to facilitate\nthe event online, and plenty of tools are available to help you make the most of it.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates)\nN/A\nLEARN MORE: (external resources)\n● \nPlanning a Virtual Demo Day: a Careful Balance of Two Worlds\n● \nHow to run a successful inclusive online event - our Demo Day lessons\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 35 of 41\n\nStage 6: Program Closing, Continual Assessment, and\nImprovement\nAt the end of the program, we design certificates of completion to the teams and\nmentors to express our gratitude and appreciation for their support.\nA key challenge area for accelerators measures impact. As yet, an agreed framework for\nmeasuring the performance of an accelerator program does not exist, but standard\nmetrics collected and published so far include the following:\n● \nNumber of applications to programs\n● \nNumber of enterprises supported\n● \nFollow-on investment raised by enterprises\n● \nThe survival rate of enterprises\n● \nNumber of employees of enterprises\n● \nNPS of the program\nWe believe that we should pay more attention to defining performance and metrics for\nsuccess. Unfortunately, as startups, accelerators often lack the time and resources for\nsuch measurements, so the impact of accelerator methods is difficult to judge with\nlimited data available.\nHere are some metrics we recommend you track:\n1. Monthly: For each program, data is collected monthly depending on the KPIs\nthe program manager sets. This could include items such as\na. Pre and post-assessment results\nb. Organization Development Plan progress and status update for each\nactivity\nc. Revenues\nd. Expenses\ne. Traction (most relevant metric per enterprise)\nf. Feedback on this month’s accelerator activities\ni. Engagement\nii. Learning\niii. Inspiration\niv. Complexity\nv. Relevance\n2.

But this isn’t the way that accelerators perceive it. On graduating from\nan accelerator program, companies are still extremely young, and potentially not yet\nviable for investment. Everything an accelerator program does is geared toward giving\nits cohorts the best possible chance of survival after graduation. So it makes sense that\nmost offer post-program support to maintain or enhance startups’ investment viability\nfor as long as possible.\nIt can typically include the following:\n● \nPublic relations opportunities\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 37 of 41\n\n● \nConnections with investors\n● \nBoard participation\n● \nHR/recruitment support\n● \nLocal meet-ups\n● \nOnline communities with funding and promotion opportunities\n● \nOffice space\nAlumni Network\nAll accelerators acknowledge their alumni network as a valuable asset of the program:\nmaintaining an alumni database is, therefore, a priority. Some host online communities\nand alumni events to create and develop the alumni network. Others call on the help of\nalumni when selecting a new cohort of potential startups. There is also the\nphenomenon of recycling founders, where startups take in unsuccessful alumni as\nmembers of their team if they consider them valuable.\nFollow-on Investment\nAccelerated startups still struggle with gaps between seed funding and successfully\nraising Series A investment. To help combat this, some accelerators offer to follow–on\ninvestment once the program is finished; they can sometimes go some way towards\nbridging funding gaps. This could be by providing staged investments or an additional\ncapital infusion after graduation.\nMentorship, Perks, and Opportunities\nOnce enterprises are part of an accelerator. They will be part of the community for life.\nThey can expand their business and network with access to a talented group of\nfounders, investors, mentors, and industry leaders. Additionally, the accelerator will\ntypically have onboarded perks partners, providing the enterprises with discounts and\naccess to helpful resources. Finally, keeping in touch with the accelerator community\ncan be beneficial as program managers often share resources, opportunities, and other\nrelevant information.\nAppendix\nRunning Hybrid Programs\nWe can think of the acceleration programs in two models:\n● \nThose that run face-to-face, which allow entrepreneurs to meet in a physical\nspace at the same time, and\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 38 of 41\n\n● \nThose that are carried out regardless of physical barriers, the time zone, the\nthousands of kilometers of distance between people, or even complex situations\n(such as those we have been experiencing in the last years).\nVirtual accelerator programs are growing in popularity and have several advantages for\nfounders and program teams. Virtual programs can also be delivered in a hybrid format,\nblending both online & offline elements. Virtual and Hybrid Accelerator programs allow\n1. Improved Flexibility\nOne of the main benefits of hybrid programs is improved flexibility, which is becoming\nextremely important within the sector. Generally speaking, entrepreneurs want as\nmany options as possible, and the ability to move from in-person to remote can be\ninvaluable. Access to recorded sessions offers a second chance at missed sessions,\nmemory refreshers, and a deeper reflection of session discussions.\n2. Work with a more significant number of enterprises from much broader\ngeographic areas.\nThe most exciting aspect of hybrid programs for many entrepreneurs is their potential\nto open up access to learning. On a basic level, when in-person is the only option\navailable, all entrepreneurs need to be within traveling distance of the accelerator\nthroughout the entire duration of their course. However, It is not necessarily the case\nwith hybrid programs, which can mean more people can participate. This will expose\nthe teams to meet people coming from diverse cultural backgrounds. In turn, this will\nlead to an increased cultural quotient and enhanced collective intelligence exercises.\n3. Support your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\nOne problem we’ve run into in the past is the limited pool of mentors available for any\ngiven in-person workshop. Virtual programming has freed us up to engage world-class\nmentors from anywhere, including mentors that bring enormous technical, business,\nand market knowledge and speak the language of the startups in our cohort –\nculturally and literally.\n4. Leveraging your workshop content to create a reusable library\nE-Learning is no longer a simple byproduct of the information age and Internet access.\nIt’s become an invaluable resource to educators, harnessing a new knowledge-sharing\nmodel wherein learners now possess the tools to learn at their own pace. Some online\ntools allow for quickly creating tests/quizzes, templates, and other resources. Practical\nbenefits include tracking digital assignments’ submissions and reusing or\nreconstructing a course curriculum using new course templates.\nKEY POINTS:\nHybrid programs allow program managers to work with:\n1. Improved Flexibility\n2. A more significant number of enterprises from much broader geographic areas\n3. Supporting your Accelerator community, even during lockdowns\n4.

People also know best when\nthey’re having fun! When they’re engaged and happy.\nCritical Aspects of Facilitation\n● \nThe same care for organizing an offline event should go into managing an online\nevent, whether as small as a meeting with a few people or as big as a major\nconference or demo day.\n● \nThe medium is the message. A well-planned and well-facilitated event can have\nmore engagement and impact than a poorly planned or facilitated event.\nCreate Bridges Between the Physical and the Virtual\n● \nPlay games and pass items back and forth between screens\n● \nShare tea, coffee, or a meal while on a call\n● \nMake a gift box of friendly perks/treats/tools to help them in the accelerator, and\nthings to do fun games/activities with:\n○ \nInspirational items (posters, notebooks, magnets, etc.)\n○ \nShirts, hats, or something to wear\n○ \nClown noses or fun items (in wrapping that disguises what they are until\nuse)\n○ \nTools for activities, such as printouts of frameworks, post-its, pens, activity\ncards, etc.\n○ \nStretching exercises, especially after having been at the laptop for more\nthan half an hour.\n○ \nSharing music: In each session, let a participant choose the session’s\nbackground music\n○ \nWhiteboard: share the whiteboard before the session begins and ask each\nparticipant to share a motivational quote/message.\nSimple Tips for Increasing Engagement Online\n● \nEye contact: Look at the camera (not the screen) when talking, especially when\nrecording something\n● \nThe background: Something nice? Art? Outdoors? Inspiring? A banner with\nlogos?\n● \nSound: Use a better mic if possible, definitely headphones. Make sure nothing is\nrubbing against the microphone or mic cable while talking.\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 40 of 41\n\n● \nAppearance: Try to be as “close to in-person” as possible … What are you\nwearing? Try not to wear big headphones.\n● \nStand up when talking (it changes body language and energy).\n● \nMute yourself whenever you’re not speaking to avoid interrupting the speaker\n● \nMake sure your Zoom name is adjusted and has your team/organization/role in it\nas well\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 41 of 41"

We create positive contexts\nwhere young people form communities, discuss challenges, and\nencourage each other to succeed. We grow best when we grow\ntogether and recognize perspectives\n3) Visualize growth: Support coaches by giving them a quantitative\napproach to identifying growth edges.\n4) Don’t reinvent the wheel. We provide coaches and teams with a library\nof activities tagged to their assessment categories to help each team\nfind their next best growth step.\n5) Keep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat \\/-Upside down pyramid\n\n2\nYouth in the driver’s seat\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the youth in our programs to help\nthem do the right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on\nextraneous, nonaligned activities. It’s essential to keep the participants in the\ndriver's seat and help them develop decision-making skills. We can help\npeople develop skills of effectiveness by creating an enabling environment.\nThis is why we’ve developed our 4 pillar assessment model and library of\nrelated activities. This library provides a “learning by doing” catalog of\nactivities that coaches can use to support young people’s development that\nspans 21st Century Skills, character strengths, and wellbeing focus, alongside\nthe development of practical skills needed for running an enterprise.\nTransformation vs. Information.\nWe help make available knowledge actionable by designing library items\naround a specific action. In our Library of activities, we provide all the\nnecessary worksheets, templates, and supporting videos to enable young\npeople to take immediate action (Library content)\nLet's not reinvent the wheel. More information is available at a\nclick of a button than before. It’s not information that people\nneed. Instead, what people need is an activation that leads to\ntransformation.\nWe can help create an enabling environment for picking data.\nThe question we start with is: What if we could offer young people a compass\nto help guide them from where they are to where we want to be?\nPersonal and professional assessments\nOur coaches are encouraged to help young people find their compass and\nidentify their needs.\nWe help coaches integrate personal development and well-being into\nprofessional development in a seamless way:\nGet the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessment)\n\n3\nWe have dissected various developmental frameworks and identified the\nessential overlapping elements to support holistic, personal, and professional\ngrowth.\nWhy integrate personal growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team\nlimits the effectiveness of an organization. Likewise, the effectiveness of a\nteam is determined by the development of each individual who comprises it.\nSo, while personal development and well-being are also at an end, we ensure\nthat the teams are more robust and the organization is more likely to keep\ngoing. Instilling such resilience helps cultivate values-driven people and a\ncommunity of social change makers with a growth mindset and a contributor\nattitude. Indeed, success comes at every step, even when that step is a failure.\nWe provide assessments to help identify where individuals and teams stand\nalong these dimensions and have a library of activities for the program\nmanagers, the program mentors, and the team to select their subsequent\nbest growth and learning opportunities.\nOur coaches are encouraged to see themselves along with the rest of the\ncoaches, mentors, and other participants in the program as a part of a\nbroader enabling environment.\nCreate an enabling environment for a proactive participation\nThe community element of building cohort-based programs is vital to help\nentrepreneurs flourish. They feel seen and supported in a community of\nlike-minded learners and builders who support each other with constructive\nfeedback and helpful resources. We win when we win together.\nBloom’s Tools to Support Application of the\nPedagogy\nBloom Open Community\nWe aim to create a healthy community for young people. Being part of an\nengaging community gives them a sense of belonging. It enables them to\nshare personal relatedness and support the social and emotional Learning of\neach other.\n\n4\nTo achieve that we leverage the Open Community forum on our platform to\ncreate networking ripples beyond the timeline of any running program.\nPeople from current and previous programs can randomly communicate,\nengage and support each other.\nBeing part of this telecollaboration enables young people to support other\nmembers. Supporting others will help them feel good and better about\nthemselves while strengthening overseas relationships.\nA number of metrics are tracked to be able to understand the level of\nengagement to help program managers intervene to boost and catalyze\nfurther connections.\nHere are a few screenshots of our Open Community:\n1. Here is a screenshot of the main page of the Community Section on our\nplatform including different sections that are relevant to the youth like\navailable Opportunities, Resources, Conferences, etc… Each of these\ncategories is an opportunity for young people to increase their contact\nhours.\n\n5\n2. Here is a screenshot of the engagement dashboard that would help\nprogram managers understand how to better catalyze the community:\n3. Participants get a simplified view:\n\n6\nQuantified Assessments\nBloom’s Training Framework provides a simple, dynamic, and adaptive\nlearning environment for individuals, teams, and organizations through a\nguided approach to project-based and cohort-based learning.\nThe Framework helps people and teams improve along 2 Core Pillars:\n1) The Individual: Universal Skills, Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH) and\nCharacter Strengths\n2) The Organization: Organization Development\nThe Framework helps individuals and teams assess core areas of strengths\nand weaknesses, and then prioritize specific areas for further learning and\ndevelopment.\nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for\nimprovement across both pillars, with an emphasis on supporting\ndevelopment in both pillars simultaneously, such as working on improving a\nspecific individual skill through activities that are helping with a core\norganizational need.\nThe Bloom Training Framework can be used in different contexts: Inside\ncompanies or organizations, in project-based learning programs (youth,\nschool, university, etc), in startup accelerators, for short events such as startup\nsprints or hackathons, or others.\nPillar 1: The Individual\nIncludes: Universal Skills (skills relevant to all roles, and in both personal and\nprofessional contexts, others may call them soft skills and they have a\nsignificant overlap with 21st Century Skills), Wellbeing & Engagement, and\nCharacter Strengths (most commonly used to help people identify their\nSignature Strengths to leverage in their work and personal growth areas).\n1. Universal Skills (Universal Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life):\na. Listening, Speaking, Problem Solving, Creativity, Staying Positive,\nAiming High, Leadership, Teamwork\n2. Wellbeing & Engagement at work and life (through PERMAH):\na. Positive Emotion, Engagement, Positive Relationships, Meaning,\nAccomplishments/Achievements, Vitality & Health\n3. Character Strengths (through VIA, Values in Action)\n\n7\na. Wisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity, judgment, love of\nlearning, perspective\nb. Courage: bravery, perseverance, honesty, zest\nc. Humanity: love, kindness, social intelligence\nd. Justice: teamwork, fairness, leadership\ne. Temperance: forgiveness, humility, prudence, self-regulation\nf. Transcendence: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude,\nhope, humor, spirituality\nUniversal Skills\nhelp people regardless of their sector or role within an organization. These\nrepresent the training component of the personal development framework.\nThe Universal Skills help our teams develop skills that will support them no\nmatter their personal or professional requirements.\nWe use the Universal Skills Framework from SkillsBuilder.org to help people\nbuild skills along four dimensions:\n1. Communication: Listening, Speaking\n2. Creative Problem Solving: Problem Solving, Creativity\n3. Self-Management: Staying Positive, Aiming High\n4. Collaboration: Leadership, Teamwork\nWellbeing and Engagement\nThis assessment comes from the school of positive psychology and is a\nmeasure of human flourishing.\nPositivity, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Achievement, and Health are\nall ends in themselves.\nScoring highly on one or many of these factors is one way to determine a life\nwell-lived.\nWe use this measure to help focus our programs on the idea that the success\nof an organization can, and should, come hand in hand with personal success.\nOur Character Strengths\nOur Character Strengths can be great tools to guide us in developing skills\n\n8\nand being effective at whatever we do. Leveraging them makes learning and\ndoing new things easier and more fun.\nIn Bloom programs, we use the Values in Action Character Strengths\nassessment to help individuals identify their “Signature Strength”. It is a\nstrength that shows up quickly and authentically, giving people energy when\nit’s used rather than taking effort.\nUsing our Signature Strengths can unlock energy and promote wellbeing at\nwork.\nThe assessment represents an analysis of virtues and values held by people\naround the world. Twenty-four Character Strengths are unequivocally known\nto be good. We can cluster these Strengths into seven virtues.\nHow to apply the Individual Development Framework\n1. Request your participants to take the Bloom Individual Development\nassessments on the Bloom Platform, which include Universal Skills,\nWellbeing and Engagement, and Character Strengths.\n2. After the individuals take the assessments, you can request individuals\nand teams to identify their Signature Strengths.\n3. Once they’ve identified their Signature Strengths, request individuals to\nselect a priority area within their Universal Skills results on the Bloom\nLearn tab.\n4. In program cycles, discussions with peers, mentors, and program\nmanagers can help participants identify & improve individual growth\npriorities and select activities for development from their personal\nknowledge, online resources, or from the Bloom Library of Activities.\n5. End of the program assessments helps participants and program\nmanagers see growth and chart paths for further improvement.\nPillar 2: The Organization\nIncludes: Organization Development system with specific assessments\nadapted to the needs of teams and programs.\n\n9\n1. Strategy\n2. Innovation & Learning\n3. Advocacy\n4. Impact Monitoring (M&E) or Corporate Social Responsibility\n5. Programs and Projects or Products and Services\n6. Community Engagement & Communication\n7. Infrastructure\n8. Team, Leadership, Staff & Volunteers\n9. Revenues & Financial Sustainability\n10. Financial Management\n11. Legal & Compliance\n12. Risk, Security & Resilience\nOrganization Capacity is the ability of an organization to achieve its mission\nwhile anticipating and managing future changes and risks.\nWe’ve derived our organization capacity assessment from methodologies\nused by international consulting firms, and adapted it for enterprises and\naccelerators.\nBloom’s Organization Capacities assessment helps organizations identify\nblind spots, giving them a 360-degree perspective on where they stand as an\norganization and helping them pick the areas of organization development\nwhich will help them most. We have adapted versions of the assessment for\nenterprises, early-stage enterprises, and accelerators.\nHow to apply the Organization Development Framework\n1. The program manager invites teams and participants to take the\nrelevant Organization Capacities assessment on the Bloom platform\n(Enterprise Capacities or Accelerator Capacities).\n2. After participants take the assessment, they are invited to go over their\nresults and discuss with their team, mentor, and program manager to\nidentify their priority areas of development and the particular objectives\nthey would like to achieve during the program.\n3. The Organization Development Plan is documented using Bloom’s\n\n10\ntemplate for the duration of the program and shared between the\nteams, the mentors, and the program manager.\n4. Regular progress check-ins during program cycles help the team,\nmentors, and program managers stay on track, adjust where needed,\nsolve problems, and track progress.\n5. Teams periodically take the assessment (whole or just for their priority\ndevelopment areas) to celebrate growth and improvements!\nMore information can be found here:\nBloom Framework v0.8 - Two Pillars (ready-approved)\nBloom Digital Library\nWe are putting forward a collection of reusable training materials and\nlearning resources developed by experts to help young people develop their\nenterprises and personal and professional skills.\nThe Library of Activities is an element of the Bloom Platform where young\npeople can take assessments, evaluate their enterprises and skills, and find\nspecialized training resources with actionable worksheets.\n\n11\nExample score results:\n\n12\nProgram manager views showcasing a summary of youth activity onthe\nplatform:\nYouth can identify their growth areas by selecting the category that’s a\npriority for them and by adding a growth goal as a description. This provides\nprogram managers and coaches a dashboard where they can see overall\nteam needs, matchmake teams based on who has strengths to offer and who\nmay need them, as well as offer suggested activities directly from library to\nthe participants taskboards.\n\n13\nUsing tasks to monitor activities is one way to support learning by doing. After\ntaking an assessment we program managers have the ability to track the\n\n14\nprogress of the activities on a single dashboard for all the participants and are\nable to encourage those who haven’t yet done the activity by sending\nmessages.\nBloom Digital Library:\nThe Bloom Library aims to provide the coaches and teams of our programs\nwith free access to learning content to support their growth. The library is\nmatched to our assessment framework, so each area a team and coach\nidentify as a potential area for development has the resources at hand to\nsupport them. We have curated training modules from local and international\nexpert trainers, which include video lessons and immediately applicable\nworksheets on all categories of our 360-degree enterprise assessment (ECAT).\nOur library also includes free access to digital books, audiobooks, and\nworksheets.\nLibrary members can borrow e-books and audiobooks on different subjects,\nincluding entrepreneurship, organizational development, skills development,\nsocial entrepreneurship, and wellbeing.\nhttps://www.bloom.pm/library/\n\n15\nWe hope the coaches benefit from our SOPs and digital services to provide\nhigh-quality tailored coaching to teams remotely and in person.\nCustomizing the Curriculum\nWe strive to adapt the curriculum to each new cohort of enterprises that best\ncaters to their needs. We base this customization on inputs from\n1. The assessment results of each enterprise: We look at the score trends\nin each category.\n2. The Team's Organization Development Plans: We look at each objective\nand critical result and extract the categories related to the activities\nplanned.\n\n16\n3. A survey of the most common categories of training topics: We ask the\nentrepreneurs to tell us what topics they are most interested in\nlearning.\nLearning by Doing\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is nothing more important than\nthe act of “doing” and “testing” to understand the product, customers, and\nbusiness model. At Bloom, we know how much theory we introduce to\nentrepreneurs versus how much time we give them to achieve results.\nTeaching entrepreneurs theory is inevitable — it is crucial to understand the\ncontext — but we make sure that every idea comes with a framework or a tool\nthat entrepreneurs can use and develop over time to achieve their goals.\nThese tools make robust theories actionable. Once we introduce them to our\nprogram, we make an effort to revisit them during the program over and over\nagain, in the best spirit of lean startup methodology, so we make sure we are\nhelping the startups drive progress and results.\nModular Learning\nModular learning, as the word connotes, uses learning modules that facilitate\nentrepreneurs learning by themselves. Thus, modular learning is a form of\ndistance learning that uses Self-Learning Modules based on the essential\nlearning competencies developed by our team of trainers with the aid of\ncurriculum developers.\nWhen there’s teaching, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and\nshow them what they need to know. But Village Capital claims that “the more\nremote work we allow, the better.” For example, indirect learning, which\nfocuses on the student’s inquiry and exploration rather than the teacher’s\ninstruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while working on their business\nplans and product.\nAccelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do\nremotely that serve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and\nhelping advance the startup. It is better to use the time to build relationships\nand get feedback. Online education with e-learning modules allows founders\nto spend more time building networks and products.\nKEY POINTS:\n\n17\n1. Curriculums are customized according to teams’ Enterprise Capacities\nresults, Organization Development Plan, surveys, and one-on-one\ninterviews to identify the most present needs\n2. Content is created well before training sessions so entrepreneurs can\nlearn at their own pace, apply their learning on homework, templates,\nand tools, and get feedback in sessions with the trainers.\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates)\n● \nProgram Planning Template v2\n● \nBloom Digital Library\nFacilitation Tools\nThe dashboard area on the Bloom platform will allow coaches to see the\npriority category the teams have chosen to develop, the assigned activities\nthey selected together, and a summary of their work plan.\nWe also provide our coaches with a Program Dashboard template which\nhelps them set Objectives and Key Results(OKRs) with their teams and\nprovides a dashboard for them to use during their coaching sessions.\n\n18\nWe include the OKR work plan template below for review.\n\n19\nEnterprise Stage Focus\nBloom has experience working with enterprises and impact initiatives at\ndifferent stages of development. We use the staged assessment to help\ncoaches identify where a team is at and what might be their next steps\ntowards their next stage. We also use stage assessments for program impact\npurposes as one of the measures of team growth.\nStages Sub-Stages\n0. LEARNING 0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1. IDEATION 1.1. Want to start and look for/testing ideas\n2. IDEA-STAGE 2.1. Exploring ideas, conducting market/customer research\n2.2. Have started developing my idea\n3. PROTOTYPE 3.1.

Established multinational enterprise\n\n20\nProgram Stages\nThe Sprint\nOur Sprint, by definition, is a short program that helps young people take a\ngiant leap into thinking about their potential. Lasting anywhere between 3-10\ndays, though they can be as short as one fun and intense day.\nIt’s loosely adapted what’s known as “The Design Sprint, “ a combination of\nDesign Thinking, Lean Startup, and Agile approach, based on a series of steps\nand techniques that help young people solve their product! In a nutshell, it’s a\nway for young people to spend a fixed amount of time on core venture\ndevelopment using today’s best practices in a coherent, integrated fashion.\nIn Bloom’s standard programs, the sprint has two main objectives:\n1. To help young people learn new skills and progress in their projects.\n2. To help us learn more about them during our selection process for the\nAccelerator.\nWe’ve found that we learn more about the people and projects through a\nshort Sprint program than through an application process and interviews.\nWe’ve also found that intense short Sprints are a very efficient approach to\nincrease contact hours and increase the possibility of new relationships.\n\n21\nThe Accelerator\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator\nprograms.\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to\nengaging, applying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical\nthinking that combines reflection and action.\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to\nrecord their daily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board.\nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or\na group rather than the negative ones. This approach builds the entrepreneur\non their strengths, specifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when\nin adverse conditions. Strengths are integral to our human identity,\nconstituting the intrinsic and inherent qualities that define us as individuals.\n\n22\nHowever, few are conscious and appreciative of them or particular about how\nwe can best put them to use to achieve desired outcomes.\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute\ndiscretionary effort towards attaining their goals. At the same time, it\nnourishes a feeling of achievement because they perform the things they are\nbest at doing. Research indicates that when individuals use their strengths,\nthey feel happier, more confident and proud of themselves, and more\nengaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense\nof resilience in achieving their goals.\nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal\nassessments to identify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them\nthrough our library of activities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we\ndeveloped the Enterprise Capacity Assessment to measure the organizational\ncapacity of enterprises. It allows us to have the whole picture of the strengths\nof both the entrepreneur and the enterprise.\nGrowth Mindset: 1% better every day, 200% better in 70 days.\nA growth mindset thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of\nunintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our\nexisting abilities. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed\n(through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth\nmindset. As a result, they tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed\nmindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). It is because they\nworry less about looking bright and put more energy into learning.\nStriving to get 1% better daily is a core tenet of the growth mindset principle.\nThis system encourages action by breaking down big, overwhelming goals\ninto small, discrete pieces. The small successes you experience with your baby\nsteps feed on each other and start building momentum, leading to more\nprominent and significant moves.\nWe encourage our entrepreneurs to try to do just 1% better than the day\nbefore. Start small and make your increases gradual. Avoid the temptation to\nget impatient and start rushing forward and taking more significant leaps.\nTake it slow, steady, and consistent.\nSimply try to do a little better than you did the day before. Daily, just focus on\ngetting 1% better in whatever you try to improve. That’s it. Just 1%. It might not\nseem like much, but those 1% improvements compound each other.\n\n23\nBloom Tools: Our programs encourage entrepreneurs to look at their weekly\npower moves. Power Moves are the moves that take us out of our comfort\nzone and push us forward. Those exhilarating first steps allow us to make\nmany more steps. Power Moves take you right out of your regularly scheduled\nprogram. They are the key to real change. They’re the most critical task that\nwill take you one step closer to your goal.\nStep by Step: Pick a target, make it tractable, get to it, and review it.\nBreaking projects down into their parts is oft-repeated advice when tackling\nsomething big. Breaking tasks down helps us see large tasks as more\napproachable and doable and reduces our propensity to procrastinate or\ndefer tasks because we simply don’t know where to begin.\nEntrepreneurs should break down the tasks to a point where they can\nproduce a reliable estimate. Each key objective should have a clearly defined\ntask or set of tasks. Tasks should be between 8 and 80 person-hours of labor.\nIt is a manageable amount.\nBloom Tools: We ask our teams to prepare an Organization Development Plan\nthat includes at least one and up to three critical objectives tied into key\nresults and broken down into significant activities or tasks. It allows us to\nunderstand what the enterprise intends to accomplish during the accelerator\nperiod. Additionally, we encourage enterprises to use the Bloom Taskboard to\nrecord their daily tasks and keep track of their progress to accomplish what\nthey’ve planned within their set deadlines.\nCommunity: We grow best when we grow together.\nWe rarely grow alone. Being part of an engaging community gives us a sense\nof belonging. It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the\nperpetual growth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part\nof a community can make us feel like we are a part of something greater than\nourselves. Providing unique opportunities for people to learn from each other\nand support and encouragement are invaluable in joining forces with our\npeers.\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises,\nstarting with them:\n● \nThe teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other\nmembers. Supporting others will help them feel good and better about\nthemselves.\n\n24\n● \nThe mentors: An open bond with new connections builds valuable\nrelationships and gives us a more profound sense of belonging. It helps\nus to reach our goals and brings a sense of security.\n● \nThe module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a\nunique resource, and through its use, it increases in value.\nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of\nlearning and feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback\nfrom their mentors, and then the module leaders give feedback.\nThe general architecture of a cycle\nBloom cycles takes the best from agile and design thinking methodologies\nused at leading innovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint\nand accelerator programs to help teams develop their startup while learning\nleading productivity techniques.\nConclusion\nThis provides an overview of our Curriculum and pedagogy. We have further\ndocumentation for training Program Managers on managing their programs\nwhich goes into further detail. We aim to continuously improve our\nmethodology with each program we run and are open to feedback, feel free\nto email bilal@bloom.pm, habib@bloom.pm and dara@bloom.pm with your\nrecommendations!"
