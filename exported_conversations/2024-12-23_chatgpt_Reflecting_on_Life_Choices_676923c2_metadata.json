I'm taking 15 milligrams of Adderall and my qualia from the Neurohacker Collective, just trying to stay positive and upbeat. And maybe it's the end of the year, maybe it's the fact that crypto is zipping and I never know when to sell, because I haven't figured out how to deal with taxes, and I don't really want to sell, and I don't really want to buy, I don't want to even look at it, and I don't really want to think about money, and I need to apply for a job, and I think I have a good prospect at the due school, but I don't want to ever get a job, because I'm not the kind of person that works for other people. I always have my own projects, and I work for myself, and it would be the first time, and I'd like you to sort of come up with 10 questions, work sort of like a mix between a coach and a psychoanalyst, and help me really reflect and think about my life, and the end of the year, it's December 23rd, 2024, and I'm feeling like the whole world is sort of falling apart, this war has kind of been going on, and I just feel a little bit uneasy in all sorts of ways, and I don't really have a job right now, or work, I have a little bit of money, but who even knows what money is, I don't know if I should be buying gold or silver, or what exactly, and I'm walking with my baby, and he's cute, and yesterday was my wife's birthday, and I'm trying to stay positive, but I'm having a hard time. Can you help me think through these things, and other things, you know, like I haven't really worked on my publication for my paper, and there's all these things that I just wish I was better at, but I'm not, and I'm getting old, and I don't really have time for working out, and my family's far away, and I don't know if I'm holding my application well, and my sheikh in Gambia, my teacher, spiritual master, has told me to always have a question of God, or a positive impression of God, and I'm struggling to do that. Can you tell me what to think, can you help me think through these things, go by questions, and try to help me understand, and find a better way forward?"

Yeah, so one, I think the most amount of stress is sort of like just feeling like I'm far from my family, that I don't really know about money and like what to do with my financial situation because the whole world seems topsy-turvy, and I guess I, you know, like, it'll be okay. I have this small business called Noor Creative Studios, it barely makes any money. I spend a lot of money on like ambitious things and hopes and dreams, and like I'll just spend all my money on an assistant to go help me, you know, be more productive and more focused, and then, you know, it doesn't necessarily solve all my problems, and my assistant is, you know, like a young junior person with bad English, and it's just not exactly the best kind of support for me because I can't afford the really expensive assistants and coaches, and I don't even have money coming in right now. I just finished a contract with the UN, they didn't really get me any new jobs, and I don't really like the fact that, you know, a lot of my self-worth and happiness comes from like, oh, I got a new job, yay, or like, oh, look at my bank account, it's got money in it, yay, but also I know that I have some obligations to my baby and my wife, and I want to be a good husband. Basically, I don't know, like, this happens quite regularly, I just feel low and down because I think I have a bit of a maybe depressive attitude or mindset, like it's been very common in my life that I just kind of feel low periodically, maybe even associated with the changing of the seasons and stuff like that, and this is not that uncommon, but I did find some mushrooms, which is nice, okay, I found a bunch of oysters, cool."

They're mostly just like grit your teeth and move forward and kind of, you know, understand that they'll change. But I feel like maybe my mind has just a negative orientation more than normal. It's I see it in my grandfather. I see it in my mom and like, you know, I try to get a little bit of an up boost feeling from my Adderall and from drinking a lot of tea or coffee, just trying to get this, you know, sense of positivity. And then when I have that, I can then have a pretty good day. But it just seems exogenous and I'm wondering if I should just go cold turkey. You know, I also have ADD and so I wonder if these things are related, you know, like ADD and people. I'm curious if you have any statistics and insights as to what happens when people with ADD hit their 40s, which is what's going to be happening with me next year and kind of what's the standard expected feelings and behaviors of wasted potential and all of that. Like I can imagine wasted potential and feeling like what am I doing in my life? And I just don't really understand how to manage my mind and I should be old enough. I should have figured this out by now and all that kind of stuff can be pretty standard. And if that's the standard, how can I be non-standard? What can I do that would be slightly different? And if I know what is supposed to happen because I'm just an average person just like everybody else and I can expect these things, what can I do or feel or say or think or start working on to respond differently to the same sort of conditions that someone with ADHD and potentially mild depression and a lot of potential and travel internationally and a lot of friends and live far away from his family and as parents age, I'm sure there's no doubt that's going to happen to you in this part of your life because parents age, you know what I mean? So what are the things that are standard happenings and what are some of the best responses that someone can do to prepare for and anticipate these things and just have a different response because I just don't want to be the average person who's surprised by the death of his parents or aging or sickness. Like that's kind of obvious. So let's see what we can do in advance and so that we can live a life without regret."

I think this is one of the things that happens to me a lot is I just get in my own way, you know? I overthink things, and my parents say that I'm too complicated, and it could be related to all of the stuff about, you know, I read so much but do so little, and I feel like I have a lot to share based on my life experience and reading and full contemplation, but not a lot of things to show for it, including like feeling like I can explain my career to somebody and have them know how to hire me, for instance. You really have to know me very well, and you have to kind of push me into a situation to say, hey, you could do this. Why don't you do this? We need somebody to run this workshop, which is what happened recently with Nihal when he asked me to run a, you know, Design for and with Marginalized Communities workshop, and I think, you know, there's other things, stuff coming up today, like I'm supposed to be working on this book. I paid a lot of money to take a course on, you know, publishing a book because I know I need the support and the encouragement and the backing and the pushing, but by now, it is like I have a few hours until our biweekly session, and I've done nothing because I was traveling and working on other things, and I had this workshop, and I didn't do any writing, and maybe I should do writing today of any kind just to get this organized and prepared, so maybe that's what I should actually be doing."

I talk, and I write, and I actually produce a lot of text, but it just seems insurmountable and they go really wide, because I'm a really curious and diverse person. My interests just go really wide and become not very practical. It goes from, like, okay, here's how you can create a sustainable business that follows aesthetic principles and how this is a beautiful thing to do, and then at some point I'm talking about epistemology and ontology and the view of Muslims on the world and how we can redefine and reaccess this more psycho-mystical, open, unitarian, oneness perspective and how that will then influence how we start businesses... I'd rather work on the deepest root causes rather than the end results of the fruits, and that makes it so that I get really broad and really, you know, I start talking about all sorts of things rather than, you know, some of the more immediate, at-hand practical stuff... I don't have a problem with writing or producing content, I have a problem with, like, thinking about other people reading it and picking an audience and all of that stuff because I actually don't want to do that. Like, picking an audience and trying to come up with, like, a marketable book and this idea of, like, it's prepackaged, easy to digest something that just feels like it will be inauthentic... I'm, like, poor and confusing and nobody understands me and no one knows how to hire me and I feel like I'm, like, rich with insight and ideas... every time I try to even just do one thing that I can try to create and share, it becomes a huge, like, worldview that people have to get in and involved in... For me, it's like, I don't have a team, I don't have a PhD, I don't have consistency in anything that I've done. I've done robotics, I've done, you know, startup support and, you know, I'm now, like, working on this kind of worldview, mystic kind of interpretation that will define how we look at businesses to make them more sustainable... I have all these ideas, and I've built all these things, and I even thought to myself, like, oh, let's try to talk to ChatGPT differently and all this AI stuff and use our pen and paper and, like, write to them long form so that we can't copy and paste, so that we're more involved with our manual connection, and I made this app, and I just put it online at cursiveGPT.com, and nobody cares, because I don't market it, and I don't share it... Am I, like, a Renaissance man that nobody cares about, that when I die, people are like, oh, yeah, he had some interesting ideas, let's retrospectively write a book and honor this random person, but instead of, during my life, when I actually need work and a job and coherence and meaning and a story"

It's like memory crystal. And when you can see it, you can be like, oh, my God. Like, if I was able to say that I helped 500 people not give up doing the things that matter to them and help them align with their intentions to do good, to share the gifts that they have in the world, like, that could be really inspiring to me... Measuring the right things could be great... I think we need, like, an immune system for AI or, like, an AI vaccine for resolving this unseen conflict that no one is really talking about between employees trying to use artificial intelligence to kind of get away with doing less work and improve their quality without their employers knowing and employers wanting to essentially at some point use AI to replace their employees and reduce the headcount on their businesses... I've been thinking about making a tool based on the frameworks that we've developed for artificial intelligence where when people start asking it questions to do work for them, it can say, hold up, let me ask you some questions to show you the beauty that you have to give... to help you see your blind spots, to help you see your skills and what you should be doing right now and to help you align on that and to encourage you and to coach you... And this way, the work can be something that you're proud of because you came up with it, you did it... I asked it to ask me a bunch of questions to get as much of the writing done by me as possible so that it could just, you know, take the writing, cut the sentences up and organize them and structure them in a way that is coherent and clear..."
