      "content": "For the no-code tools I've used, I've used Softer, which allows you to connect Google Sheets and Airtable to a front-end. I've also used the Airtable front-end builder, which is good for behind-the-scenes work. I've used MiniExtensions, which also allows you to use Airtable to update a database visually. I've used Make.com and Zapier to create automations that run JavaScript in the cloud to allow us to do some processing on forms and give people some updates. One of the earliest versions of the assessment tool for Bloom that helped people identify their growth areas was actually using just a script that would take Airtable data and then populate an email with values in a real-time process, so that people could actually get results immediately, and that was really cool. The first paragraph will focus on my skills and achievements, emphasizing my role at Bloom. Great. Training experience. I am also a trainer. I have been a facilitator and a convener and a community builder for many years, including at gemcee.org, where we were hosting different technical and non-technical workshops. I love hosting and designing and facilitating courses. People seem to like my courses and my talks. I'm a public speaker as well, and all of my talks are highly informative.\nYeah, so I’ve worked in Lebanon since 2016 and my work explore personal development and positive impact in the world and in terms of the positive positive impact I’m not sure we’ve trained 100 and00s of entrepreneurs in Lebanon and in the Middle East",
