      "content": " To help develop your principles for Bloom.pm, I'll first examine the Scout Oath and its relationship to Scout Laws, and then create three different ways to cluster your elements into a similar structure.\n\n## Understanding the Scout Oath and Laws\n\nThe Scout Oath states:\n\"On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.\"\n\nThis oath serves as an overarching commitment, while the 12 Scout Laws (Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent) provide specific principles to live by. The oath establishes the commitment to follow the laws, creating a hierarchical relationship where the oath is the promise and the laws are the guidelines for fulfilling that promise.\n\n## Three Options for Bloom.pm Principles\n\n### Option 1: Development-Centered Framework\n**Bloom Oath**: \"On my journey as an entrepreneur, I commit to developing myself holistically, supporting my enterprise responsibly, and contributing openly to our community.\"\n\n**Bloom Laws**:\n1. **Self-Awareness**: I will identify and leverage my signature strengths.\n2. **Well-Being**: I will prioritize my health as the foundation of my success.\n3. **Leadership**: I will cultivate the skills to guide myself and others effectively.\n4. **Enterprise Growth**: I will address organizational priorities systematically.\n5. **Transparency**: I will share my progress and insights when comfortable.\n6. **Active Engagement**: I will participate fully in the Bloom community.\n\nThis clustering focuses on the developmental aspects of each commitment, emphasizing personal and professional growth.\n\n### Option 2: Value-Based Framework\n**Bloom Oath**: \"I pledge to uphold the values of self-knowledge, resilience, and collaboration as I build my venture and contribute to the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\"\n\n**Bloom Laws**:\n1. **Authenticity**: I will understand and apply my true strengths.\n2. **Sustainability**: I will maintain my well-being to sustain my efforts.\n3. **Capability**: I will continuously develop my entrepreneurial toolkit.\n4. **Responsibility**: I will strengthen my enterprise through deliberate action.\n5. **Vulnerability**: I will share my journey with others appropriately.\n6. **Commitment**: I will engage actively with all program elements.\n\nThis approach emphasizes the underlying values rather than the actions themselves.\n\n### Option 3: Impact-Oriented Framework\n**Bloom Oath**: \"I commit to maximizing my positive impact through personal excellence, organizational effectiveness, and community contribution.\"\n\n**Bloom Laws**:\n1. **Inner Alignment**: I will align my work with my natural strengths.\n2. **Energy Management**: I will optimize my well-being for sustained impact.\n3. **Skill Mastery**: I will develop the competencies needed for success.\n4. **Venture Excellence**: I will build a strong, purposeful enterprise.\n5. **Collective Learning**: I will contribute to our shared knowledge.\n6. **Proactive Growth**: I will take initiative in my development journey.\n\nThis clustering focuses on the impact areas of each commitment, highlighting how they contribute to overall success.\n\n## Questions to Help Select the Right Framework\n\n1. Which framework best aligns with Bloom.pm's core mission? Is your primary focus on development processes, values embodiment, or impact creation?\n\n2. How do you want participants to relate to these principles - as developmental milestones to achieve, values to embody, or impact areas to influence?\n\n3. Which framework would be most memorable and actionable for entrepreneurs at different stages of their journey?",

            "extracted_content": "Program FAQ  \n\nWhat is the ACSI4 Accelerator program?\nBuilding on the first two editions, the third edition of the Asfari Challenge for Social Innovation (ACSI4) program aims to support 13 social enterprises in their ideation or prototype stage based in Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and the Syrian diaspora. The Accelerator program aims to build the enterprises’ capacity with weekly training and mentorship facilitated by Bloom in partnership with the Asfari Foundation. Participating enterprises will develop their ideas and prototypes into functioning business ideas through Bloom’s online platform, training pedagogy, networks of experts, and customized curriculum. \n\nWhat are the key dates:\nPublic Launch and Applications Open on  Feb 3, 2025\nOpen house starts on  Feb 13, 2025\nThe application deadline is Feb 24, 2025\nEnterprises are notified of selection into the Bootcamp by  Mar 3, 2025\nBootcamp begins on  Mar 13, 2025\nBootcamp Demo Day is on  Apr 3, 2025\nEnterprises are notified of selection into Accelerator by April 11, 2025\nAccelerator begins on April 22, 2025\nDemo day is on/around August 12, 2025\n\nWhat benefits do I receive from the program?\nFunding up to $3,830 to support an essential aspect of the business could improve growth and sustainability. \nTraining, mentorship, and other support during the three-month accelerator program \nLifetime access to Bloom’s resources and network of entrepreneurs, including mentors, investors, alums, and staff\nDemo day exposure and other investor connections\n\nHow can we get funded after the program ends?\nWe provide the seed funding to get you going, but you may need more funding to continue your enterprise efforts. Near the end of the accelerator program, we’ll organize a Demo Day to help connect you with investors, funders, and organizations that could help you in the following stages of your enterprise journey. We’ll coach you so you’re as effective as possible and do everything we can to help get you follow-on support and funding. \n\nWhat language is the content delivered for the program?\nThe primary language in verbal and written communications during accelerator activities is English. However, we can also offer support and mentorship in Arabic or French. We may adapt these during the program to respond to enterprises' needs. \n\nWhat is a typical day and week for a team during the program?\nIt’s your enterprise, so you’ll be hard at work on your business, the product, marketing, HR, etc. We’ll have between one and three weekly sessions, from formal workshops to informal discussions with our mentors, trainers, and guests. Some of those are “required,” but many are optional, and we expect enterprises to adapt and join the critical sessions for issues they’re dealing with in their enterprise. We’ll also regularly have required check-ins with each enterprise, usually every month. \nIn general, though, you’ll be working on your enterprise each day, just like all of the other founders in the program. We don’t tell you what to do or when, but we create an environment conducive to helping your enterprise daily. And we’ll ensure you have many experienced mentors around to help you.\n\nWhat kind of enterprises are we looking for?\nSocial enterprises with specific areas of focus in sustainability, good governance, independent media, active citizenship, lifelong learning, innovation, and systems change.\n\nHow do you choose which enterprises to accept into the program?\nThis varies per program.\nWe will use the following criteria to assess eligible applications. These are not all requirements, but preferences and enterprises will be weighed on the different elements:\nImpact: What difference will your idea make, and for whom? How many jobs will you create, what sort of marginalized communities will you impact, and whether you align with the priority impact areas?\nCapacity: What skills, knowledge, and resources do you have to develop and deliver your idea?\nFeasibility: Can you realistically deliver your idea by the end of the program and within budget?\nSustainability: Whether your idea has the potential to become financially sustainable and last beyond the lifetime of the funding we provide.\nStage of Enterprise and Product: Whether the enterprise is already generating revenue and the stage of development of the specific product or branch that this program will support.\nInclusion and user testing: Whether the voices of your target clients have been included in the prototype/solution design and whether your client base includes different demographics, backgrounds, sexes, etc.\nInnovation and growth potential: Whether your idea is new and different, and where or how it can grow.\n\nWhat kind of enterprises are eligible for the program?\nYour enterprise is eligible if it meets the following criteria:\nYour enterprise is in the idea or prototype stage\nMore than one person in the team, with at least two team members working full-time in the enterprise.\nNo restrictions on sociographic or other parameters regarding the applicants.\nFemale-led enterprises and enterprises with higher diversity (age, sex, socio-economic background, refugee/host communities, location around Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, and Syrian diaspora, etc.) are particularly encouraged to apply. \nWe are unable to support\nEnterprises of only one individual. \nEnterprises engaged with other entrepreneurship/innovation programs/accelerators, unless there is a clear distinction between the program offerings, and enterprises can demonstrate that they have time and capacity to join this program in addition to their other program commitments.\n\nWhat stage of enterprises is eligible for the program?\nImagine a spectrum of entrepreneurship running from learning about the concepts and skills to having a mature enterprise changing the world. Those stages are categorized as follows. For the sake of this challenge, we will focus on supporting enterprises as indicated in yellow below:\n\nEnterprise Development Stages\nStages\nSub-Stages\n0. LEARNING\t\n0.1. Learning without the goal of launching an enterprise\n1. IDEATION\n1.1. Want to start and looking for/testing ideas\n2. IDEA-STAGE\n2.1. Exploring ideas, conducting market/customer research \n2.2. Have started developing my idea\n3. PROTOTYPE (has concept, no revenues)\n3.1. Have an early (low-fidelity/paper) prototype (of product or service)\n3.2.  Have a functioning (high-fidelity) prototype with early users / early adopters\n4. EARLY-STAGE (have revenues, but not profitable)\n4.1. Declining revenues and the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n4.2. Revenues are stagnant or growing slowly, but the enterprise is not however profitable/sustainable\n4.3. Revenues are growing quickly, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable\n5.
