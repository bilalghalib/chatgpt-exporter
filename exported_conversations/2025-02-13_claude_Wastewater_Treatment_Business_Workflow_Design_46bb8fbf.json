Like designing the right pipes and channels for water flow, we need to ensure smooth information flow through your business processes.\n\n1. For the sales pipeline: What are the typical stages a lead goes through - from initial contact to signing a contract? Could you outline the key decision points where a potential client might move forward or step away?\n\n2. About the design calculations: What specific calculations are done in that first 30% phase? Understanding this will help determine if we need automation or integration between your calculation sheets and project tracking.\n\n3. Regarding document management: What types of files need to be tracked throughout a project's lifecycle (e.g., permits, engineering drawings, contracts, calculation sheets)? Do these documents need specific approval workflows?\n\n4. For team communication: Besides you and your father, who else needs access to project information (e.g., design consultants, contractors, municipal authorities)? What level of access should each type of stakeholder have?\n\n5. About reporting and analytics: What key metrics would help you track business health? For example, conversion rates from initial contact to contract, typical project timelines, or regional distribution of installations?\n\nWould you like to start with any of these areas first?",

We market and sell a patented design for waste water treatment shafts, handle initial design work (first 30%), and work with partners across UAE, Iraq, and Turkey.\n\nHere's what we need to track:\n\n1. Projects & Sales Pipeline:\n- Project name, location, and client\n- Project stage (Lead, Info Sent, Contract Discussion, Active, Complete)\n- Key dates (First Contact, Last Contact, Contract Date)\n- Project value and payment status\n- Assigned team members and local partners\n- Market region (UAE/Iraq/Turkey)\n- Last contact date and next follow-up\n\n2. Technical Project Details:\n- Link to Excel calculation sheets\n- Design parameters and specifications\n- BOQ details\n- Design review status\n- Document approvals needed\n- Equipment specifications\n\n3. Partners & Team:\n- Internal team members and their roles\n- Local contractors by region\n- Design consultants\n- Equipment manufacturers\n- Contact information for all parties\n\n4. Document Library:\n- Technical specifications\n- Standard calculations\n- Patents documentation\n- Design templates\n- Proposals sent\n\nWe need to track project progress, maintain client relationships, and ensure smooth handoff to design consultants. The system should help us monitor sales pipeline and project status across different regions.\"\n\nWould you like me to modify this in any way before you use it with Airtable's AI?",
