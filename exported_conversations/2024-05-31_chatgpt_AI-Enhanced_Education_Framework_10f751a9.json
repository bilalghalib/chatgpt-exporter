      "content": "Cultivating Artificial Craftsmanship: A Framework for Human-AI Collaboration in Education\nDescription:\nAs AI, especially generative AI, rapidly advances and permeates the education landscape, it is crucial that we develop strategies and competency frameworks to harness its potential in a human-centered, ethical way. Rather than fearing AI will replace human effort and creativity, we must explore how it can enhance and augment our capabilities through thoughtful collaboration.\nThis presentation will introduce an innovative framework called \"Artificial Craftsmanship\" that aims to facilitate meaningful, symbiotic partnerships between educators, learners, and AI systems. Drawing upon insights from cognitive science, educational psychology, and AI ethics, the framework outlines key principles and methodologies for designing AI-enhanced learning experiences that prioritize human agency, growth, and the unique \"imprint\" of each individual.\nKey elements of the Artificial Craftsmanship framework include:\n\nDefining AI competencies and ethical standards for educators and learners that emphasize discernment, critical thinking, and responsible use rather than blind reliance on AI outputs.\nDeveloping pedagogical strategies and tools that leverage AI's capabilities to provide inspiration, feedback and knowledge extension while requiring active human engagement and original contribution. The goal is for humans and AI to evolve and learn together.\nEstablishing methods to capture and encode the subtle, often unconscious elements of an educator's or learner's unique style, perspective and creative process. This \"human imprint\" is then integrated into the AI collaboration, resulting in outputs that reflect individual identity and agency.\nImplementing assessment approaches that evaluate the quality of human-AI collaboration and knowledge artifacts based on criteria such as originality, criticality, and ethical reasoning, rather than just efficiency or surface-level performance.\n\nThe presentation will feature concrete examples and case studies of the Artificial Craftsmanship framework being applied in various educational contexts, from K-12 classrooms to university courses. Empirical data on learning outcomes, engagement levels, and creative self-efficacy will be shared.\nAttendees will gain practical insights and strategies for designing AI-enhanced educational experiences that empower educators and learners to become \"artificial craftsmen\" - harnessing the power of AI as a tool for augmenting and expressing their unique human capabilities. The framework's emphasis on human agency, growth and identity offers a promising path forward for education in an AI-driven world.\nBy facilitating dialogue and knowledge-sharing around human-centered approaches to educational AI, this presentation aims to contribute to UNESCO's mission of promoting ethical, inclusive and transformative digital learning on a global scale. It will equip education stakeholders with conceptual foundations and practical techniques to proactively shape the future of educational AI as a force for human flourishing.\n\nRewrite removing the artificial craftsmanship part and add more details and context from the documents about how we can best address this call for talk proposals:\n\nUNESCO will organize the second edition of Digital Learning Week from 2 to 5 September 2024 at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. The concept note of Digital Learning Week 2024 is available online for your reference. This annual event has been recognized as one of the “UN Intergovernmental and Multi-Stakeholder Digital Cooperation Bodies and Forums” to convene the community of digital education leaders, policy-makers, researchers and practitioners from various organizations, including UN agencies, governments, NGOs and the private sector.\n\nDigital Learning Week 2024 aims to promote multi-stakeholder cooperation towards a human-centred and climate-friendly design and use of AI in education, with a specific focus on exploring the interlinkages between digital transformation and greening education.\n\nTo surface best practices and facilitate knowledge sharing, UNESCO is opening a call for proposals of presentations during Digital Learning Week 2024. Selected presenters will have the unique opportunity to address a global audience comprising policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, private sector partners and development agencies.\n\nPlease note that UNESCO mainly seeks proposals pertaining to practices that have been implemented at scale, which means that conceptual ideas without practical implementation are not preferable.\n\nThe form below requests a narrative description of your presentations while personal information such as email addresses will not be shared. If your presentation is selected for inclusion in the programme, the description you provide will be used directly on the UNESCO website and other communication materials. Please allow yourself sufficient time to complete the required fields and ensure clarity and readability of text. Only proposals in English or French will be considered.\n\nPresentation proposals must be submitted to UNESCO no later than 31 May 2024. Selected proposals will be notified by 28 June 2024.\n\nPlease note that only selected submissions will be notified via email.\n\n",

      "content": "update the doc including some of this information, return a proposal that is only 300 words long focusing on these themes:\n1.1 National or institutional AI competency frameworks or standards for students\n2.3 Design and implementation of innovative methodologies for training and/or assessing teachers’ AI competency development\n3.1 Strategies developed and implemented for addressing challenges that AI, especially generative AI, poses to academic integrity and learning assessment\nTraining programmes implemented and/or guidelines tested to support teaching and research staff to develop AI competencies and make ethical use of AI *\n\nThe concept of using LLMs to enable \"dark talent\" - identifying and empowering extremely talented individuals from marginalized backgrounds anywhere in the world. The author argues LLMs could help level the playing field in terms of access to knowledge and opportunities.\nThe idea that human intelligence and machine intelligence have deep similarities in how they process information through analogies, abstraction and concept clustering. The author proposes that by exposing humans to how machines learn, we can transfer some machine learning advancements to marginalized human learners.\nThe philosophical argument that beauty and elegance are reliable guides to truth and meaning, as seen in fields like mathematics and science. The DNA structure example illustrates how the correct answer was also the most beautiful one.\nThe notion of \"mental complexity\" levels and how machines are increasingly able to handle the \"how\" of tasks while humans must focus on the higher-level \"why\". The author argues education should focus on developing this higher wisdom and sense of purpose.\nThe overall thesis that in the age of AI, the role of humans is to access our \"zone of genius\" - the intersection of all our knowledge plus an element of inspired, indescribable intuition about meaning, purpose and beauty. Education should aim to develop this capacity.\n\nThe document presents a thought-provoking vision for the future of human learning and flourishing in an AI-driven world. The ideas around machine-human knowledge transfer and re-envisioning education around wisdom and beauty are particularly intriguing and novel. The philosophical elements woven throughout add depth to the author's perspective. CopyRetryFor Naeem:\n\nShare what I have given even if it is one word. \n“Convey from me, even a single verse…”\nعَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ عَمْرٍو أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ بَلِّغُوا pastedBGcan you find the most interesting and relevant items in this document?what are the 5 relationships between this new document for naeem and the 5 elements aboveHere are the 5 most interesting and relevant items I found in the document, and how they relate to the 5 elements discussed earlier:\n\nThe importance of inner transformation and personal development:\n\n\nRelates to the idea that personal growth and inner states are the primary means of development. The document emphasizes the critical role of inner work, self-reflection, and cultivation of enduring positive states in authentic change.\n\n\nFocusing on meaningful, value-driven entrepreneurship rather than just scale:\n\n\nConnects to the notion that actions should align with one's deepest values and aspirations. The author argues entrepreneurship should be about pursuing a meaningful \"why\" that resonates with one's authentic self, not just chasing money or impressive scale.\n\n\nAppreciating the beauty and potential in each individual:\n\n\nTies into the foundational belief that humans are fundamentally good and possess a \"divine spark\". The document advocates trusting in people's innate goodness and unique potential, which educators should help them unlock.\n\n\nCultivating a sense of awe, wonder, humility and faith:\n\n\nRelates to embracing uncertainty and a higher power/intelligence. The author shares their spiritual journey of developing faith and humility by being open to surprise, amazement and truths beyond the material world.\n\n\nRedefining success metrics to prioritize transformation and meaning:\n\n\nChallenges the reductive quantification of entrepreneurship programs' impact. Instead, the document proposes focusing on meaningful human interactions, inspiration, and personal transformation as key success indicators.\n\nIn summary, the document builds upon the earlier ideas by advocating for a more holistic, personal growth-oriented and values-driven approach to entrepreneurship education - one that recognizes the fundamental goodness in people, inspires awe and humility, and redefines success in more meaningful terms beyond pure scale or financial outcomes. The common thread is inner transformation as the foundation for positive external impact.\n\ninclude some of this information \nSteps to Produce the Thematic Analysis Framework\nFamiliarization with

document and how do they relate to our framework work?\n\n\nINSPIRE & NAVIGATE\nAligned Pedagogically Sound Frameworks\n  For Transformational Learning\n\nIntroduction - How to Learn What You Don’t Know Without A Teacher\nLearning how to learn is the fundamental skill of learning. It implies we must know about ourselves, our abilities, and our limits and understand the knowledge landscape. It’s been our experience that most people fail to achieve good results with LLMs because they approach them expecting answers, instead of approaching them to produce answers themselves, aided by the tool.  To use LLMs effectively we must understand them deeply, understand learning deeply, and to map between learning needs and the architecture and mechanics LLMs have that open up different affordances. \n\nIntuitively we can do this through a simplified geometric representation of a goal and a knowledge map and some intuitive leaps. We are approaching this practically and comprehensively, although when fudging between technical accuracy and usefulness comes, we will err on the side of useful. It is our hope to refine this approach further till there comes a day we do not have to make any logical compromises.  \n\nWe believe it may be possible to have  a one to one map for the production of data points, which leads to information, which is then refined into knowledge both within the human mind as a learner, as well as within leverageable structures within LLMs. The question of wisdom will likely remain the domain of the human, and this is the essence of our hypothesis. \nWhy does this matter? The automation process continues to reduce work that was meaningful because only a human could do it, once a machine is able to do work, the essence of where we draw meaning from is reduced. So, what is a human for im an age of LLMs and AI? I believe it is our job to access our zone of genius, that place where your unique voice will make a true contribution not present in the embedding space. And I believe that by appropriate LLM use we can develop just in time expertise by learning the gap between where we are and our goals, identify the prior knowledge, map the landscape of a problem space, and identify and address your unknown unknowns till you arrive at your destination. \n\n\nTo get the intuition we will be exploring the idea of vector spaces and goals geometrically and together we’ll be traveling through vector spaces. Once you grasp this idea, you'll be able to learn things that you didn't even know you needed to learn. And then, you will be able to perform tasks you didn't know you needed to do.\n\nSince last December after hundreds of hours of GPT use the following framework has been developed. Finding first the principles that led to better results with Large Language Models (LLMs) and then later formalized through the lense of cognitive science, adult development theories and research into transformative pedagogies for learning. The guiding question has always been to identify the leverage offered by the fundamentals of how LLMs work - embeddings and concept clusters and transformer attention mechanisms, and to identify the opportunity space made by these two new vectors for learning. Of particular interest to the author is how LLMs may offer individuals pushed to the margins due to migration, economic impoverishment, being born in the wrong country, or otherwise - and how they may be able to identify the limits of their understanding in contrast to others who’ve been given every advantage to explore, to experience, to be mentored and through this to develop a vision, build understanding and capacity and finally to be able to act upon their dreams\nBalaji Srinivasan, author of the Network State, describes “dark talent” - the idea that through networking we can find extreme talant anywhere then support and network them into a powerful State beyond borders. This idea superficially sounds possible, yet upon further consideration good ideas do not come simply from numbers of brains alone. Exposure is critical. While there are many definitions for intelligence, the one that appeals to me most is the one proposed by Douglass Hofsteader in his book Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire as the ability to abstract and generalize from specific instances into concepts that become manipulable in an uninterpreted way. For instance the moment you hear something it’s either a noise or a sound, a sound you can say has an isness - an implication, hooked into an idea, a noise is something that must be interpreted. That immediate translation from auditory input into categorization likely develops like our other senses, and it’s for this reason I propose we may be more likely homo-sensorious than homo-sapiens, since thinking is seeing. The process of taking sensory input, conceptual input and deriving a new “one of those” is a process humanity does individually and collectively. Youth are often at the forefront, as GenZ slang demonstrates copious examples. \nLet’s talk about being “Based” - which originated as a way to describe someone who was “freebasing” drugs, which itself is a created concept based on the idea of acids and bases, transforming amines, usually basic, into their neutral counterparts to alter their consumption methods and impacts. Now, for GenZ, being based simply means “not caring” - and it’s very likely the majority of people using the word have no understanding of the chemical processes underpinning the origin of the word. And most chemists likely do not know that the word, base, comes from the greek pedestal due to it bening the structure upon which an acid rests upon when making a salt (The Origin of the Term “Base” by William B. Jense 10.1021/ed083p1130). \n\nWhy did we take this long detour into understanding the origins of ideas? It’s to make it clear that there is more than superficial language connecting human intelligence with machine intelligence, and that by exposing how a machine learns to a human, we can transfer some of the millions of dollars and effort spent running millions of words across the attention mechanisms of LLMs to the most marginalized learners on the planet. Making it more likely that they could be one of the “dark talents” that will come up with the idea that will deeply and positively impact their communities and our world. The network state should seek true diversity for it to make true on its promise, otherwise we will have a silicon valley state with Berlin, Beijing, Paris, Silicon Valley, New York, Porto, Dubai, Bangalore and other cities like these being over-represented, and not due to their population count. \nTo increase the possible surface area of ideas crossing minds that are able to merge and encompass I believe we need to create structures to support what is already common in transformational learning to be the foundational elements of pre-training and fine tuning of our LLMs and then to make them universally available on smartphones, it’s estimated that by the end of 2024 7.1 billion people will have a smart phone totaling nearly 88 percent of the human population(including infants).\nWhile we’re waiting for openAI and Anthropic to integrate machine-human transfer learning into the core of their offering, we have options:\nSupport the development of the ways of being that inspire prompting along the framework described below. \nTechnological supports: Build grammarly-like plugins that highlight non-optimal uses of LLMs and offer suggestions of improvements to increase machine to human intelligence transfer. \nDeveloping customized system prompts that align with the person that will maneuver the LLM to being more transfer and transformational in its dialog. \n\nThese two ideas:\nTransfer and transformation hint at what I believe to be the key insight underneath much of this argument, that we can learn best when we learn in symbiosis with a machine that learns in similar ways (concept clustering). \nSalience is the sense that things are meaningful and make sense, when you write a poem referring to your infant child as the light of your life, she doesn’t become photons, yet you may sense the rightness of this analogy. When taking certain entheogens one might start reducing their critical thinking allowing them to make analogies that are further off from reality. This lamppost reminds me of my highschool history teacher’s handwriting - perhaps. Yet how helpful is it for them, let alone others? Only God(swt) has the highest analogy, truely being able to see the oneness of everything - to hold that in total comprehension. We are reduced to analogies that are “useful” - yet the true geniuses are those that continue to expand and encompass till they are able to hold more things in the light of oneness. This is the process of meta-cognition. The ability to dive into the uniqueness yet zoom out into the unity at will. This in/out process is what enables the building of patterns across truely related concepts that those inside the concept space might not be able to see. \nThis is how pattern recognition is possible. A developer at a certain level of mental complexity may think their job is to provide code that achieves a goal - contrast this to a CEO making a decision where they may need to be able to see the interrelationships between being a father, a ceo, the company in the context of the economy, the economy in the context of global cultural shifts against capitalism, the international climate and how it relates to a decision between stainless steel and aluminum.\nThis level of thinking is more related to a why than a how. \nMachines are more and more able to take over the how, and normally mental complexity and human transformation that leads to it arises after many years of “one of those”ing many situations, building experience throughout life. Is it possible to develop and transform and grow in the true sorts of comprehension that allow someone to see and know the why behind things, the thing that touches the indeterminate gut intuition, the sense of rightness, the value that one knows through their emotions, the feeling of beauty that arises when the right thing emerges. \nThis is a “zone of genius” - this is everything one knows and an element of the ineffable, what exactly is a beautiful idea? How does one make a decision at high levels of abstraction? I believe that it’s similar to the physicist who chooses the more beautiful equation and finds this “trust” is rewarded. Or as G Hardy says: “The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or the words must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics.” Why?\nWhile one may dive into controversial territory speaking of God or Truth. I believe we can stay within the realm of the philosophical and logical. We see that salience is possible to artificially enhance, that moment when someone on a psychoactive substance senses they just found the meaning of everything and they write it down only later to find it’s something like “the stars are beautiful, and I am a star” or some other phrase that doesn’t quite pack the same punch. This is related to the difference between a two dimensional matrix True and false and permanent and transitory. There are moments in our lives when we are able to go a level above our mental complexity and we glimpse the world from above, like a flatlander in 2 dimensions being pulled into the third dimension and can finally understand the topology of 2 dimensional shapes, that all the differences he sees in triangles and squares and octogons, that really, in a sense that is hard to build when you live in 2, they’re all the same, a single line encompassing a space - all essentially circles. \nTo gain an intuitive understanding of the sort of space of inspiration needed to build new knowledge, let’s study this picture carefully:\nWhat does it look like it represents? \nImagine you produced this image through this process:\n\nTry to determine the structure of the material in the place of the green shape in the image above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Would you have guessed a corkscrew?\n\nWe now know what DNA looks like, I can only imagine the AHA moment Rosalind Franklin had when she made the connection between all the data. I also wonder if she also decided to use the frame of a twisted strand because it was beautiful. If only she was alive today to ask.\n\nThis realization that we find throught science and mathematics, that beauty is a trustworthy guide may have evolutionary origins, although there is no reason that of all the ways the world could have worked that it should be this way.\n\nI believe that a good human life is connected to this source of knowledge, the source where we know beauty and align ourselves and our actions with it. It’s not to become a bootcamp developer or whatever is the current trend in education. The how will be automated, craft remains since craft remains tied to purpose and beauty.\n\n2/2\n\n\nChatGPT\nUnique and Novel Insights in the Document\nHuman-LLM Symbiosis and Air Gapping:\n\nInsight: The concept of \"air gapping\" ensures that LLMs inspire human effort rather than replace it.

      "content": "### Talk Title:\n**Unleashing the Zone of Genius: Transforming Learning with LLMs**\n\n### Introduction:\nGood [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. Today, I want to explore an exciting and transformative idea: how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help us identify and cultivate our \"Zone of Genius.\" Rather than focusing merely on results, we will discuss how these powerful AI tools can assist us in becoming the kind of people who produce unique and meaningful work—work that only we can do, work that truly matters.\n\n### The Concept of the Zone of Genius:\nThe \"Zone of Genius\" is a concept that refers to the unique intersection of our innate talents, passions, and skills. It's where we are most effective, creative, and fulfilled. Identifying and nurturing this zone is crucial for personal growth and achieving a sense of pride and satisfaction in our work.\n\n### Current Educational Challenges:\nIn traditional education systems, the focus is often on achieving specific results—grades, test scores, and standardized outcomes. This results-oriented approach can stifle creativity, diminish agency, and overlook individual strengths. Instead, we need to shift towards helping learners discover and thrive in their Zone of Genius.\n\n### How LLMs Can Help:\n#### 1. **Identifying Individual Strengths and Passions:**\n   - **Personalized Feedback:** LLMs can analyze a learner's work, interactions, and interests to provide insights into their unique strengths and passions.\n   - **Skill Mapping:** By mapping out the areas where learners naturally excel, LLMs can help identify potential Zones of Genius.\n\n#### 2. **Encouraging Originality and Creativity:**\n   - **Prompting Unique Responses:** LLMs can provide prompts that encourage learners to think creatively and develop original ideas, fostering a sense of ownership and pride in their work.\n   - **Exploring Diverse Perspectives:** By exposing learners to a wide range of ideas and viewpoints, LLMs can help broaden their understanding and inspire innovative thinking.\n\n#### 3. **Fostering a Growth Mindset:**\n   - **Emphasizing Process Over Results:** LLMs can shift the focus from achieving specific outcomes to valuing the learning process and personal growth.\n   - **Resilience and Adaptation:** Through adaptive learning pathways, LLMs can help learners navigate challenges and setbacks, building resilience and a growth mindset.\n\n### Measuring Success Beyond Results:\n#### 1. **Self-Worth and Pride:**\n   - **Qualitative Feedback:** Collecting feedback on how learners feel about their work and their progress in discovering their Zone of Genius.\n   - **Personal Reflections:** Encouraging learners to reflect on their achievements and the personal significance of their work.\n\n#### 2. **Impact on Agency and Engagement:**\n   - **Increased Engagement:** Monitoring levels of engagement and enthusiasm as learners explore their passions and strengths.\n   - **Autonomy and Initiative:** Observing the degree to which learners take initiative and demonstrate autonomy in their learning.\n\n### Practical Implementation:\n#### 1. **Homework that Matters:**\n   - **Personal Projects:** Assignments tailored to individual interests and strengths, encouraging learners to pursue topics they are passionate about.\n   - **Real-World Relevance:** Tasks that have practical applications and real-world impact, enhancing the sense of purpose and meaning.\n\n#### 2. **Transformative Assessment:**\n   - **Narrative Assessments:** Using narrative feedback to highlight personal growth, creativity, and originality rather than just numerical scores.\n   - **Portfolio-Based Evaluation:** Assessing a body of work that showcases a learner’s journey, achievements, and unique contributions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, the true power of LLMs lies not in the results they can produce but in their potential to help us become the kind of people who produce unique, meaningful work. By focusing on identifying and nurturing our Zone of Genius, we can transform education from a results-oriented system to one that celebrates individuality, fosters creativity, and instills a deep sense of pride and self-worth. Together, let's reimagine learning and embrace the journey of becoming our best selves with the help of AI.\n\nThank you.",
