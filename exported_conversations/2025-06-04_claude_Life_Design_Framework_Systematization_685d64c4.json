They want me to:\n\n1. First list the ideas, processes, and tools from Stanford's life design curriculum\n2. Then think about how to formalize this into a system for parsing LLM-human conversations and notes to extract insights\n3. Extract variables to populate frameworks that can be useful progressively\n4. List the frameworks\n\nThis is a complex query that requires me to draw on my knowledge of the Stanford Life Design methodology. I should be careful not to over-flatten or oversimplify their comprehensive approach.\n\nLooking at their user preferences:\n- They like metaphors when figuring things out (I should incorporate this)\n- They prefer Python for coding (not immediately relevant here but good to know)\n- They like constructive criticism and pushback (I should challenge assumptions where appropriate)\n- They don't like being flattered (avoid saying their idea is \"great\" or \"wonderful\")\n- Only say something is unique/groundbreaking if true\n\nI should approach this systematically and be honest about the complexity and potential limitations of trying to automate life design insights.I'll break this down systematically, starting with Stanford's Life Design tools and then examining how we might systematize them for automated analysis.\n\n## Stanford Life Design Tools & Processes\n\n**Core Tools:**\n- **Odyssey Plans** - Three 5-year life scenarios (current path, alternative if money/image didn't matter, wild card if first plan didn't work)\n- **Good Time Journal** - Daily energy/engagement tracking across activities\n- **Workview & Lifeview** - Written reflections on work's purpose and life philosophy\n- **Mind Mapping** - Visual exploration of interests, values, and possibilities\n- **Prototyping** - Low-risk experiments to test life/career hypotheses\n- **Design Thinking Process** - Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test cycle\n- **Reframing** - Converting problems into actionable design challenges\n- **Ideation without evaluation** - Generating options before judging them\n\n**Assessment Tools:**\n- Values identification exercises\n- Energy audit across life domains\n- Coherence checks between workview/lifeview\n- \"Stuck\" vs \"choice\" problem differentiation\n\n## The Goal (with some pushback)\n\nYour instinct to systematize this is interesting, but here's where I'd push back: Life design's power often lies in its human-centered, reflective process rather than pattern recognition. Think of it like trying to automate therapy - you might extract useful data points, but the transformative work happens in the contemplation and choice-making process.\n\nThat said, if we frame the goal as **creating scaffolding that helps humans do better life design work** rather than replacing the human element, we could build something valuable.\n\n## Potential Frameworks for Progressive Analysis\n\n**Framework 1: Coherence Mapping**\n- Parse conversations for workview/lifeview statements\n- Identify value conflicts or alignments\n- Flag areas where stated values don't match described actions\n\n**Framework 2: Energy Pattern Detection**\n- Extract mentions of activities and associated emotional language\n- Build energy profiles across different life domains\n- Suggest prototype experiments based on energy spikes\n\n**Framework 3: Stuck vs. Choice Classifier**\n- Identify when someone frames something as having \"no options\" \n- Distinguish between gravity problems (unchangeable) and design problems (solvable)\n- Suggest reframing exercises\n\n**Framework 4: Prototype Suggestion Engine**\n- Map stated interests to low-risk experiments\n- Track prototype outcomes and suggest iterations\n- Build a library of \"prototype patterns\" that work for different personality types\n\nThe metaphor here would be like having a really good life design teaching assistant - not making decisions for people, but helping them see patterns they might miss and suggesting tools they haven't tried yet.\n\nWhat specific aspect of this systematization interests you most? Are you thinking about personal use, coaching tools, or something broader?",
