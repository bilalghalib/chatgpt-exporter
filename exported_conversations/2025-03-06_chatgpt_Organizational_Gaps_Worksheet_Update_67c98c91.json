How are you doing today? \nToday will be the first step in a series of leadership sessions that will help you strengthen your business operations. Before bringing in new team members, it’s essential to assess your organizational gaps and explore different ways to fill those gaps. \n\n\nIdentify the skills and knowledge gaps in your business.\n\nLearn how to fill gaps by building strong partnerships.\n\nCreate a plan to build partnerships based on your business needs.\n\n\n\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nIdentify the skills and knowledge gaps in your business.\nLearn how to fill gaps by building strong partnerships.\nCreate a plan to build partnerships based on your business needs.\n\nYOUR BUSINESS MODEL:\nREVENUE STREAMS\nCOST STRUCTURE\nCUSTOMER SEGMENT\nCHANNELS\nCUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS\nVALUE PROPOSITION\nKEY RESOURCES\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nKEY PARTNERS\n*https://strategyzer.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/topics/113454-using-our-tools-canvases-methods\n2 minutes: Lecture\n\nThe trainer should recap where we are on the BMC. \nWe have already talked a lot about the right side of the BMC. We have been developing our products/services to fit the needs of our different customer segments. We have also looked at how those products and services will bring in profits through our revenue and cost structures. Now we are going to look at the left side of our BMC which is the internal part of our business. \n\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nMarketing\nLogistics\nProduct Development\nOperations\nStrategy\n\n5 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nThe first step to identify your business gaps, is to understand all the activities and resources you need to efficiently and effectively deliver your product/service to your customer.\n\nAsk: What are all the key activities (or actions) that we need to do in order to deliver our products/services to our customers? – Write all answers on the whiteboard. Try to get entrepreneurs to be specific.\nPotential answers:\nMarketing\nResearching customers needs\nCreating marketing materials\nPosting ads\nHolding events\nUnderstanding customer values and sustainability preferences\nLogistics\nDelivery\nStorage\nTransportation\nSupply chain monitoring\nResource efficiency management\nProduct development\nApp maintenance\nMarket research\nPrototyping and testing\nMaterial selection and optimization\nDesigning for durability/longevity\nOperations\nProduction\nFinance\nHR\nResource management\nWaste reduction\nEnvironmental compliance\nStrategy\nPlanning\nPartnerships\nFinancing\nRisk assessment\nResilience planning\nWhen listing these, note that activities like resource management and waste reduction not only address environmental concerns but can significantly reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.\n\nIf entrepreneurs are having a hard time thinking about key activities, consider going over the points shown in this Mckinsey model to help entrepreneurs brainstorm some other key activities and resources needed. The seven areas of organization are divided into the ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ areas. Strategy, structure and systems are hard elements that are much easier to identify and manage when compared to soft elements. On the other hand, soft areas, although harder to manage, are the foundation of the organization and are more likely to create the sustained competitive advantage.\nStrategy is a plan developed by a firm to achieve sustained competitive advantage and successfully compete in the market. Someone needs to be focusing on creating a well-aligned strategy that is clearly articulated, long-term, and helps to achieve competitive advantage.\nStructure represents the way business divisions and units are organized and includes the information of who is accountable to whom. Someone needs to organize the company in terms of management and organizational structure and tasks.\nSystems are the processes and procedures of the company, which reveal business’ daily activities and how decisions are made. What are the systems that are in place (or need to be created) that determine how business is done and it should be the main focus for managers during organizational change.\nSkills are the abilities that firm’s employees perform very well. They also include capabilities and competences. During organizational change, the question often arises of what skills the company will really need to reinforce its new strategy or new structure. Each business will need specific skills. Tourism business needs someone knowledgeable about local historical sites and fun places to go. A consulting business needs employees with technical business knowledge. What specific skills do you need?\nStaff element is concerned with what type and how many employees an organization will need and how they will be recruited, trained, motivated and rewarded. Someone needs to train and onboard staff!\nStyle represents the way the company is managed by top-level managers, how they interact, what actions do they take and their symbolic value. In other words, it is the management style of company’s leaders. Setting a company culture could be considered a key activity. How do you make sure that all areas of the business are abiding by your policies and living by the company culture?\nShared Values are at the core of McKinsey 7s model. They are the norms and standards that guide employee behavior and company actions and thus, are the foundation of every organization. Many successful businesses now include people and planetary health among their core values, recognizing that wellbeing and efficiency makes good business sense. \nYou can also use a SWOT analysis to find gaps and identify both efficiency opportunities and potential resource risks.\n\nRecap: Doing this can help you in a few ways including:\nTo help understand the gaps that may appear in the business\nIdentify which areas you should focus on to optimize or boost your business performance\nThink about the results of future changes within your business\n\nGiven my key activities,\nwhat are MY capabilities?\n\nKey Activities – My Capabilities = Business Needs\nWhat am I good at?\nWhat are the roles and responsibilities I can take?\n\nWHAT CAN I DO MYSELF?\n5-10 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nNext, we should take a look at all the things that we can do ourselves. \nAsk: Which of these things (on the board) can we do on our own? What processes could be optimized to improve efficiency? Think about if it was just 1 founder running this business. What can they realistically do?  \nCircle each of the things on the board and identify if you can do them or not: \nPotential answers:\nMarketing\nResearching customers needs - I can do this, and should do it often.\nCreating marketing materials - I can do this, but I am not good at it. \nPosting ads - I can do this.\nHolding eventI can do this, but might need some help.\nLogistics\nDelivery - I don’t have the capacity to do this with the number of orders I am expecting.\nStorage - I have space for a small amount of storage. I can do this now, but need to find another solution as I grow..\nTransportation - I can’t do this. There is too much to deliver to and from cities. \nResource tracking- I can implement basic monitoring, but need help with systems for tracking material and energy use\nProduct development\nApp maintenance - I can’t do this. \nMarket research - I can do this.\nPrototyping and testing - I can do this except for the technical parts (coding).\nMaterial efficiency- I understand basic concepts but may need expertise to identify all optimization opportunities.\nOperations\nProduction - I can do this, but will need help as I grow. \nFinance - I can do this now, but will need help as I grow.\nHR - I can do this, and should be very involved. \nWaste management - I can implement basic waste reduction practices\nStrategy – As the founder, I should be heavily involved in the strategic parts of my business!\nPlanning\nPartnerships\nFinancing\nMarketing\nRisk Assessment\n\nAsk: When thinking about what you can do yourself, what are some things that you should keep in mind?\nWhat you are good at. What skills are you lacking?\nWhat you are excited and happy doing.\nWhat you have time and energy to do.\nWhat you (a founder) should be focusing your energy on, \nand what you can delegate to others. \nYour budget and ability to delegate things to others.\nEtc…\n\nFinally, once you have identified your key activities and what you are currently able to do, you are clearly able to see the gaps! Point out all the areas that aren’t circled on the whiteboard. We need to find a way to get those things done. \n\n5\n\nWHAT’S NEXT?\nDo it yourself!\nHire\nPartner\n3-5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: Once you identified the gaps, what are the three primary ways to fill them?\nDo it yourself: We already talked about things that you can do yourself; however, if you want to grow your business and have it be successful, you need to enroll others to join your team and operations. \nPartner: Another thing you can do is partner with someone to help you do those things. You can outsource another person or company to help you to fill that gap. Maybe you aren’t good at marketing, you can use an advertising agency to help you fill that gap, for example. We will go more into this point today!\nHire: Another way is through hiring someone onto your team to fill the gap. We will go deep in this part in the next lead session!\n\nIDENTIFYING YOUR BUSINESS GAPS!\n\u000b\n\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nCURRENT STATE\nMarketing\n\u000b\nDelivery\n\u000b\nLogistics\n\u000b\nApp Maintenance\n\u000b\nOperations\n\u000b\nFinance\n\u000b\nHR\n\u000b\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nCURRENT STATE\nFUTURE STATE\nMarketing\n\u000b\n\u000b\nDelivery\n\u000b\n\u000b\nLogistics\n\u000b\n\u000b\nApp Maintenance\n\u000b\n\u000b\nOperations\n\u000b\n\u000b\nFinance\n\u000b\n\u000b\nHR\n\u000b\n\u000b\nKEY ACTIVITIES\nCURRENT STATE\nFUTURE STATE\nCHANGE GAP\nCHANGE ACTIVITIES\nMarketing\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nDelivery\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nLogistics\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nApp Maintenance\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nOperations\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nFinance\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\nHR\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n\u000b\n45 minutes: Activity\n\nAfter we explain the process of identifying gaps and the ways to fill those gaps, we will have an activity to apply it in the handouts folder. \nEach entrepreneur will work on identifying their gaps and setting a plan to fill those gaps. \n30 minutes: Individually work on the handout. The trainer will be around to help people fill out the document the right way. \n15 minutes: Group discussion and sharing. What are the biggest gaps entrepreneurs are facing? What are the major challenges entrepreneurs are facing to fill those gaps? Are there ways to work with each other to fill those gaps?\n\nPARTNERSHIP\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nWe will now go deeper into strategic partnerships as one of the ways to fill organizational gaps. We will look at examples of different types of partnerships and the benefits that each one has. \nAsk: Before we give some examples, what do you think are the different types of partnerships you can have? Think of ways that you can work with other people to have mutually beneficial outcomes?\nPotential answers:\nBuyer-supplier partnerships can help you get better deals and manage your workflows better.\nYou can partner with companies and organizations that have similar missions to yours to spread awareness about your business or help each other get customers,\nAn investor is a partner! \nYou can partner with influencers on social media,\nEtc…\n\n\nA partnership is an arrangement where 2 or more individuals or groups agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests.\nWHAT IS A PARTNERSHIP?\n1 minute: Lecture\n\nBasically, a partnership is an arrangement where 2 or more individuals or groups agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. The partners in a partnership may be individuals, businesses, interest-based organizations, schools, governments, or any combination of those things. We will now go over a few examples of common types of partnerships.\n\n\n9\n\nJoint Venture Partner\nA joint venture occurs when two or more businesses join together to pursue a common project.\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS:\n+\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nHere you may join your company with another to create an entirely different entity, which may be more profitable for the both of you than if you were to operate separately.\n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a joint venture (you don’t have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\nUniversal and Warner Bros. are entering a joint venture on sales, marketing and distribution of Blue Ray DVDs in North America. Separately, Universal will handle distribution for WB’s physical media in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan starting in Q3 of 2020 while WB will do the same for Universal’s physical media in the U.K., Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Under the proposed structure, the studios will continue to operate their digital distribution businesses independently and retain content and consumer marketing for both physical and digital.\nYou can have another person join as a partner.  silent investor, they are not decision making people, they don’t have a certain role in the business. Vs of the general partner that has a certain role and they are decision making persons. Here is an example of a limited (silent) partner vs general (active) partner: \nLet’s say, “Shwan” runs a food café business and has “Majd” as his partner. In this business, Shwan is the general partner whereas Majd is a limited partner. “Majd” has given $1 million in the business as a capital investment. The money helps “Shwan”, pay for his staff expenses and purchase raw material. “Majd”, does not participate in running the business but receives monthly share out of the profits.\nBMW Group and Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) are pursuing their successful strategic long-term cooperation in the field of sustainable mobility today by signing binding agreements aimed at long-term collaboration between the two companies for the joint development of a fuel cell system, joint development of architecture and components for a sports vehicle, and joint research and development of lightweight technologies. These agreements follow a memorandum of understanding signed in June 2012.\n\n\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a joint venture?\nTo combine resources. A bigger entity may have more clout in an industry or more resources to ensure the success of a venture. \nJoint ventures have shared investment, expenses, and profits (or losses). \nTo combine expertise. In technical businesses, one company might have expertise in one part of a venture while the second company might have expertise in another part. For example, Company A might be good at creating software, while Company B has experience creating the hardware that's needed for a venture.\nTo save money. Two companies might consider a joint venture to save money on advertising, maybe at a trade show or in a trade publication.\nTo enter a foreign market. In this case, a foreign company forms a joint venture with a U.S. company that is in the market the foreign company wants to enter.\nTo manage rental property. A joint venture may form a partnership to own and rent properties together.\n\n10\n\nStrategic Alliance Partner\n\nAn agreement between two or more parties to pursue a set of agreed upon objectives needed while remaining independent organizations. \nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP:\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nThis means that you and a company that you have no direct competition with, industry wise, will partner together in ways that will benefit the both of you.\n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a strategic alliance (you don’t have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\nLocal example: Mr. Erbil and Lala Candles joined together to create Mr. Erbil branded candles. They used Mr. Erbil’s luxury brand name and Lala candles high quality product to create something new that they can both benefit from. \nSpotify and Uber: Leaping forward to a very recent piece of news, Spotify and Uber have partnered to provide stereo control to Uber customers. Not every Spotify consumer uses Uber, nor does every Uber rider have a Spotify account. The strategic alliance allows each company to pursue prospects from the other’s existing customer base, all while continuing to promote both products. In both cases, it gives the company a leg up over its competition. Spotify is offering something with the Premium package that other streaming services do not yet have. And likewise, Uber can provide the riders with an opportunity to listen to their own playlists as opposed to other ride-share services that cannot match them yet.\nYou can partner with a manufacturer to produce a part of your business product that you yourself may not be able to manufacture. In return, you have a contract to pay for these parts that your partner has made you.\nStarbucks has created several strategic alliances that you can see on the next slide. \nhttps://www.allbound.com/resource-center/successful-strategic-alliances-5-examples-of-companies-doing-it-right/\n\n\n11\n\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP:\nStrategic alliance partnership example:\n\n\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nStarbucks has created several strategic alliances that have helped them increase sales and reduce costs related to production and distribution of their products. \nThey partnered with Barnes and Nobles bookstores in 1993 to provide in-house coffee shops, benefiting both retailers.\nIn 1996, Starbucks partnered with PepsiCo to bottle, distribute, and sell the popular coffee-based drink (Frappuccino). In this situation they benefited off of PepsiCo’s highly efficient manufacturing and distribution channels. \nA Starbucks – United airlines alliance has resulted in their coffee being offered on flights with the Starbucks logo on the cups\n\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a strategic alliance? \nSharing resources and expertise. \nNew-market penetration. In some cases, a strategic alliance gives access to new markets with a solution that wouldn’t have been possible for either company on their own. For instance, companies going global often work with a trusted local partner to get an advantage in an emerging market.\nExpanded production. When it comes to manufacturing and distributing products, strategic alliances allow partners to increase their capabilities and scale quickly to meet demand.\nDrive innovation. With the right alliance, partners can outpace the competition with new solutions that are a complete package for their customers. These alliances are creative and revolutionary and change the market landscape in a dramatic way.\nStrategic alliances allow partners to scale quickly, build innovative solutions for their customers, enter new markets, and pool valuable expertise and resources. And, in a business environment that values speed and innovation, this is a game-changer.\nhttps://www.workspan.com/blog/strategic-alliance-definition/\n\nThis means that you and a company that you have no direct competition with, industry wise, will partner together in ways that will benefit the both of you.\n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a strategic alliance (you don't have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\n\nLocal example: Mr. Erbil and Lala Candles joined together to create Mr. Erbil branded candles. They used Mr. Erbil's luxury brand name and Lala candles high quality product to create something new that they can both benefit from.\n\nSpotify and Uber: Leaping forward to a very recent piece of news, Spotify and Uber have partnered to provide stereo control to Uber customers. Not every Spotify consumer uses Uber, nor does every Uber rider has a Spotify account. The strategic alliance allows each company to pursue prospects from the other's existing customer base, all while continuing to promote both products.\n\nResource-sharing example: A business with excess warehouse space partners with a complementary business needing storage, reducing costs for both while optimizing resource use.\n\nEfficiency partnership: A restaurant partners with a local farm to secure reliable produce while reducing transportation costs and ensuring freshness. The farm gains a steady customer while the restaurant can market its locally-sourced ingredients.\n\nTechnology-sharing example: A clothing manufacturer partners with a tech company that has developed water-efficient dyeing technology. The clothing company reduces production costs through water savings, while the tech company gets to scale its innovation.\n\nYou can partner with a manufacturer to produce a part of your business product that you yourself may not be able to manufacture. This can include suppliers with expertise in resource-efficient materials or processes that help reduce your costs.\n\nStarbucks has created several strategic alliances that you can see on the next slide.\n\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP:\nStrategic alliance partnership example:\n\n\nStrategic Alliance Partner\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\nSchaduf and Agropro Monitor have created a strategic alliance that has helped them increase their market reach and enhance their product offerings:\nThey partnered to combine Schaduf's expertise in precision agriculture and water management with Agropro's advanced crop monitoring technologies.\nThis alliance allows them to jointly develop technologies tailored to the specific agricultural needs of the Middle East and Africa.\nSchaduf will exclusively market Agropro Monitor's services across the region, creating a comprehensive solution that neither company could offer alone.\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a strategic alliance?\nCombining complementary expertise. In this case, water management from Schaduf and pest management from Agropro.\nNew-market penetration. The alliance helps a Brazilian company enter Middle Eastern markets with a trusted local partner.\nExpanded offerings. The partnership creates a more comprehensive solution that addresses multiple farmer needs simultaneously.\nDrive innovation. Together they can develop technologies specifically tailored to regional agricultural challenges.\nhttps://schaduf.com/schaduf-and-agropro-monitor-join-forces-to-revolutionize-middle-east-and-african-agriculture/\n\n\nCompetition Partner\nA group of competing companies come together to develop a solution for a problem that they all share, and none of them would gain a competitive advantage.\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP:\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nIn these relationships, one or both partners views the other partner's success as something to thwart or outdo rather than a joint victory. Such a partnership will help spread the risk both companies may take. \n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a competition partner (you don’t have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\nPfizer + Merck: Another successful example of competitive collaboration is the powerful alliance between Pfizer and Merck (both in pharmaceuticals). These pharma companies entered a strategic partnership to bring new cancer treatments to the market as soon as possible. Although they are competitors, they invested together to save money and find solutions that they can both benefit from faster. \nSamsung and Sony formed an agreement in 2004 to share research and development costs in an effort to both design flat screen LED television. Again, they are both competitors who invested in something they can both benefit from. \nYouTube and Vimeo have a similar relationship. During an innovation panel at the 2019 ForbesWomen Summit, Vimeo CEO Anjali Sud shared that the video platform joined forces with YouTube, one of its main competitors by allowing creators to publish their videos to YouTube, as well as to other video platforms.\nGoogle supported Mozilla (Firefox web-browser), a rival to Google Chrome, in order to limit the expanding influence of Microsoft Internet Explorer and Apple Safari.\n\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a competition partnership?\nOutcompete another competitor\nIt may also help when both partners are trying to do something new and share the risk of investment.\nIt could mean a confirmed supply stream. For example, there is a need for earth metals in mobile phones. So securing the supply of rare earth metals could be the reason for competitors to form a strategic partnership.\n\n14\n\nFinancing & Distribution partnerships help businesses reach more customers by combining a product or service with financing or market access.\nFinancing & Distribution Partnership\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP\nFinancing & Distribution Partnership\n5 minutes: Lecture + Discussion\nKESK and Vitas Iraq have partnered to expand access to solar energy solutions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in Iraq through innovative financing.\nKESK, Iraq’s first greentech company, provides solar-powered cooling and energy solutions to businesses.\nVitas Iraq, a microfinance institution, offers loans to SMEs looking to invest in solar energy but lacking upfront capital.\nThis partnership allows businesses to switch to solar energy affordably, reducing electricity costs by up to 70%, maintaining operations during power outages, and cutting reliance on diesel generators.\nA pilot project provided financing for 100 businesses to adopt KESK solar-powered AC units, proving the viability of the model.\nAsk: Why do businesses form financing & distribution partnerships?\nExpanding market access—KESK can sell more solar systems, reaching customers who otherwise couldn't afford them.\nLowering financial barriers—Vitas Iraq benefits from offering a high-demand financial product while driving sustainable development.\nSupporting economic resilience—By providing a clean, cost-effective alternative to unreliable grid power, businesses can improve productivity.\nEncouraging green energy adoption—Businesses become early adopters of climate-resilient infrastructure with financing support.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/keskco_/p/C6wD2iHOLcP/?img_index=1\n15\n\nBuyer-supplier relationships refer to commercial transactions between organizations for the purchase and supply of goods or services.\nBuyer-Supplier Partner\nTYPES OF PARTNERSHIP\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nHere you may join another company and agree to use each other as the go-to supplier/buyer for a product..\n\nGive a few examples or ask the class for examples of a joint venture (you don’t have to explain all of them below, just enough to get people understanding what it is):\nIntel and Lenovo: Lenovo uses Intel microprocessors in all of their computers. By doing this, they have been able to ensure consistent quality in their products, create a more efficient supply chain, and possibly have saved money through the negotiation process. \nBusinesses in the bazar probably buy all their items from one place. They could be on an automatic schedule with their suppliers or they have built relationships and can easily order whenever they need. They don’t need to research many different suppliers every time they need new products. They know what they are getting each time from the same person/company. \n\nAsk: Why would a business want to form a buyer-supplier partnership? \nCost saving\nTime saving\nIt will make things faster and easier\nYou can get a better deal\nYou will have same suppliers that can lead to consistent quality\nYou can trust each other because of a long term relationship\n\n16\n\nHOW ARE PARTNERS PAID?\n3-5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: How are partners paid?\nPotential answer:\nThere is no specific way that a partner is supposed to get paid. It will all depend on your agreement. \nSome partners are owners, not employees, so they don't get a paycheck. Each partner receives a share of the profits and losses of the business each year. Payments are made based on the partnership agreement.\nPartnerships use a partnership agreement to clarify the relationship between the partners, the roles and responsibilities of the partners, and their respective shares in the profits or losses of the partnership. \nThere are some partnerships that are paid monthly or at the time that a product or service is delivered. Making the partnership might allow for a discount or reliability (consistent on time delivery without having to go through the process of ordering, for example).\nSometimes they don’t get paid. They just share in mutually beneficial activities.\n\n\n17\n\nWHAT PARTNERS SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR?\n15 minutes: Activity\n\n10 minutes: Activity\nBased on the gaps we have identified and the different types of partnerships we have discussed, who should you partner with? Try to be specific and think of people or organizations you might want to reach out to with the hopes of making some type of agreement. \nShare the Partnership Activity from the drive. \nEntrepreneurs should work individually \n\n5 minutes: Share and recap\nAsk them to share and then wrap up with final thoughts including:\nFind a partner that can bring skills and experience to the business. \nFind a partner that shares your values, entrepreneurial spirit, and vision.\nLook for a partner without a lot of personal baggage.\nFind a partner that can offer resources and credibility to your business.\nChoose a partner that is financially stable.\n\n18\n\nOptimization and economies scale.\nReduction of risk.\nAcquisition of needed resources.\n\n\n\nPARTNERSHIP GOALS\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\n\nOptimization and economy of scale: The most basic form of partnership or buyer-supplier relationship is designed to optimize the allocation of resources and activities. It is illogical for a company to own all resources or perform every activity by itself. Optimization and economy of scale partnerships are usually formed to reduce costs, and often involve outsourcing or sharing infrastructure.\nReduction of risk and uncertainty: Partnerships can help reduce risk in a competitive environment characterized by uncertainty. It is not unusual for competitors to form a strategic alliance in one area while competing in another. Blu-ray, for example, is an optical disc format jointly developed by a group of the world’s leading consumer electronics, personal computer, and media manufacturers. The group cooperated to bring Blu-ray technology to market, yet individual members compete in selling their own Blu-ray products.\nAcquisition of particular resources and activities: Few companies own all the resources or perform all the activities described by their business models. Rather, they extend their own capabilities by relying on other firms to furnish particular resources or perform certain activities. Such partnerships can be motivated by needs to acquire knowledge, licenses, or access to customers. A mobile phone manufacturer, for example, may license an operating system for its handsets rather than developing one in-house. An insurer may choose to rely on independent brokers to sell its policies rather than develop its own sales force.\n\n19\n\nComplete the tool to help you identify and fill your business gaps. \n\nIdentify possible key partners to help fill gaps.\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n20\n\n\nTHANK YOU\nANY QUESTIONS?\n21]]]\nRemember our principles here [[[Integrated Business Resilience Framework: Efficiency, Risk & Values\nCore Principles for Module Integration\n\nBusiness-First Approach: Frame sustainability as a strategic business advantage with concrete benefits:\n\nRisk reduction and operational resilience\nCost efficiency and resource optimization\nMarket differentiation and customer loyalty\nLong-term business viability\n\n\nIntegration Method: Weave resilience concepts naturally into existing business modules by:\n\nEnhancing existing examples with efficiency dimensions\nAdding business case studies that demonstrate the alignment between values and profitability\nIncorporating risk assessment into standard business planning frameworks\nUpdating facilitator notes with discussion prompts about long-term business durability\n\n\nPractical Tools: Supplement modules with concrete decision-making tools:\n\nRisk & Resilience Assessment worksheet to identify business vulnerabilities\nBusiness Efficiency Checklist to locate cost-saving opportunities\n\"No-Regrets Path\"  framework for customer journey mapping - meaning finding out customer values and be sure to meet their needs/wants while upholding their values \nValue-Aligned Menu Design for product/service offerings\n\n\n\nModule-Specific Integration Points\nUX/Customer Journey Mapping\n\nIncorporate the \"What's on the menu is what's on the mind\" concept to show how businesses shape customer choices - ux shows a menu that constrain users so we need to be careful\nAdd the \"No-Regrets Path\" concept to prevent customer disappointment\nDemonstrate how transparency about environmental attributes creates value for customers\nUpdate examples to showcase customer satisfaction driven by values alignment\n\nBusiness Model Canvas\n\nEnhance the Value Proposition section to include differentiation through sustainability\nUpdate Key Resources section to address resource efficiency and supply chain resilience\nExpand Cost Structure section to identify efficiency opportunities\nAdd risk assessment to business assumptions testing\n\nCost Model\n\nIncorporate resource efficiency into cost calculations\nDemonstrate long-term ROI of efficiency investments\nAdd scenario planning for resource volatility and supply chain disruptions\nInclude operational efficiency metrics in financial projections\n\nImplementation Framework\n\nFor Each Module:\n\nIdentify 3-4 high-impact slides for enhancement\nUpdate facilitator notes with discussion prompts\nCreate a simple worksheet or tool if needed\nDevelop a business case example showing the business benefit\n\n\nCross-Module Integration:\n\nEnsure concepts build progressively across modules\nReference previous learnings to reinforce connections\nMaintain consistent terminology across all materials\nBuild toward comprehensive business resilience understanding\n\n\nMeasurement Approach:\n\nDevelop metrics that focus on business outcomes\nInclude both short-term efficiency gains and long-term resilience indicators\nConnect environmental improvements to financial performance\nEnable businesses to track progress with simple tools\n\n\n\nThis framework provides a comprehensive approach to integrating sustainability as a core business strategy focused on efficiency, risk management, and values alignment – all driving toward long-term business success and resilience.]]]",

How are you doing today? \nToday, we will talk all about financing alternatives! We are coming to the end of the incubator and you will soon be working towards launching your business. In today’s session, we will look at your business and think through all the ways startups typically secure financing.\n1\n\nUnderstand typical startup financing options.\nIdentify local financing alternatives that you can use.\nCreate an alternate post-incubation go to market strategy.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nUnderstand typical startup financing options.\nIdentify local financing alternatives that you can use.\nCreate an alternate post-incubation go to market strategy.\n\n2\n\nProduct development\nOperational support\nMarketing\nFINANCE WHAT?\n3-5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: Why do startups need to be financed?\nPotential answers:\nHelp them grow faster\nGo to market faster\nHelp with product development \nPay for marketing and operational costs before turning a profit\nEtc…\nRecap: It might seem really obvious, but financing can be really important for startups. Although there are ways to start without being financed, when you have extra cash, you can go to the market much faster helping you to secure your place in the market. \n\nAsk: So how can you pay for these things? \nPotential answers:\nDebt: Borrowing money that will be repaid.\nEquity: Raising money by selling shares or a part of your business equity represents ownership of your business.\nOther funding: There are also other sources of funding such as grants, pitch competitions, etc… \nNo funding: You can grow organically without the use of any funds. Or you can invest your own money into the business. This is also known as bootstrapping. \n\n3\n\nDEBT VS EQUITY\nDEBT\nEQUITY\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nStart a conversation around the 2 primary sources of financing, debt and equity.\nWrite all the answers on the whiteboard with debt on one side and equity on the other side.\nAsk a few questions to get a healthy discussion going: \nAsk: What do you know about debt and equity? Which is better?\nNeither of them are inherently “good” or “bad”. They have their pros and cons and are better or worse for a startup in different situations. Both of them:\nAre ways to finance your business\nProvide cash to start up or grow and scale\nCan pay for salaries, operating costs, startup costs, product development, and more.\n\nAsk: Why is debt good/bad?\nYou keep full ownership of the business- good\nNeed to pay all the money back (with interest)- bad\nIf you face cash flow issues, you can spiral into a worse situation. Banks often take collateral when you take out a loan and if you can’t pay it back they might take your house, car, or something else. - bad\nThere are usually no obligations after you pay the lender back. You can simply move on from them. - good\n\nAsk: Why is equity good/bad?\nBy choosing to finance through equity, you are choosing to share ownership (and profit) of your business\nBy selling a part of your business, you now give someone who might help you to make business decisions. It all depends on the agreement and match between you and the other person, but often times investors might:\nConsult or mentor you, \nBe a part of the decision making process,\nStay silent and just wait for returns,\nShare their network, knowledge, and experience with you,\nEtc…\nYou don’t usually have to pay back funds because investors expect distant returns -good\nThere is no one way that an investment works. It all depends on the agreement you make with the investor. You must agree on terms and find the right partner to support you based on your needs.\n\nTrainer note: Make sure to bring up debt/equity in the context of your location and the current situation (you might need to research this before the session)\n\n4\n\nPartners\nEQUITY\nAngel Investors\nVenture Capital\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nAs we mentioned on the previous slide, one of the most common ways to start a business is to sell a part of your business. Again, business equity represents ownership. When someone invests in your business, you don’t have to repay them directly because they are buying ownership and will likely take a share of the profits. Again it will all depend on the details of your term sheet, but that is typically how it works.  \n\nAsk: What are the most common ways to sell equity? In what situations can you sell equity (also known as “selling ownership” or “selling shares”) of your business in the context we are in here? Go into the pros and cons of each option.\nOpen the conversation to discuss the current situation you are in. Make sure to cover these 3 points as well:\nPartner: One way to get capital or support in the form of resources and support is to find a business partner or co-founder. This person might invest cash, resources, and be involved in the day to day running of the business. They might take a salary, but they might not. This person will be highly involved; therefore, they should be as passionate about the business and invested in its long term success as much as you are. It is common for tech businesses to have a co-founder with a tech/coding background. \nInvestment can range in the amount. Oftentimes there is a degree of sweat equity that is provided by the partner. This is the value you put into the business in other non-financial ways. Maybe you are working for free in your business for example. Your time is valuable and should be calculated.\nYou might be able to find these partners through connections and networking events. Be careful and take your time with this to ensure the right match!\nNetworking is key. You might find these partners through:\n- Connections and networking events.\n- Startup communities.\n\n\nAngel investors:  Angels invest in startups with high growth potential. Angels are usually localized and want to “give back” to the community. Angels typically step in to provide funding for companies that have exhausted any friend and family investments or personal savings they may have been able to access, and before investment from VCs. There are benefits of mentorship, connections, and sector specific knowledge (among other things). They may be more involved than venture capitalists and help startups refine financial strategies. Angels are usually willing to help more than VCs. \nUsually invest between $25-100k. Can be more or less though.\nYou can find angel investors through local angel networks, other entrepreneurs (especially if they have been funded), or other connections.  \nYou should build a relationship with the investor to get them onboard. Make them believe in you as the founder and inspire them with your vision. \n\nVenture capital: Venture capital funds typically finance startups with long term growth potential. These funds usually come from investment banks or venture capital firms. To get venture capital, you need to show real traction and have secured customers. Venture capital firms might focus on something in particular such as an industry or startup stage for example. \nUsually invest $1-5 million, but can be much more ($100 million for example). Sometimes they will do less than $1 million, but this is less common.  \nThis is the hardest type of funding to secure.\nIt is hard to apply to, and it is hard to get approved as well.\nThere is a more formal due diligence process which includes pitches, business plans, interviews, and more. \nSome VC firms focus on startups that have a focus on financial sustainability through supply chain efficiency and or energy use because they see these as lower-risk, higher-return investments and align on values.\n5\n\nSales \nPromotion\nBusiness loans\nMicroloans\nDEBT\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAnother one of the most common ways to raise money is by taking out a loan. We mentioned the pros and cons of this before, but now we will talk about how to actually take out a loan here. \n\nAsk: What are ways that you can take out a loan here?\nBusiness loans: You can take out business loans through banks. The trainer should do research and share some specific examples with the entrepreneurs. \nMicro loans: Some institutions offer microloans (usually $2-6K in Iraq) to new or small businesses. The trainer should do research and share some specific examples with the entrepreneurs.\n\nTransition: You can also borrow from friends, family, and other people. This is usually a smaller amount of money because it is from an unofficial source. This is usually safe, but if you take out loans with people you don’t know well, they might take collateral for what they lend you. \n\n6\n\nFRIENDS, FAMILY, AND FOOLS\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nOne way that entrepreneurs start their business is by asking everyone they know for support. This support can be in the form of advice, resources, money, and more.  As you start, don’t be afraid to ask anyone/everyone for help. Your family and friends are a great starting point. \nAsk: Why do you think that is?\nThey love you and want to support you\nThey are easier to convince because they might not look at the idea like an investor or bank would\nThey have watched you develop your idea over time and really believes in it like you do\nThese people will give you money and resources for all different reasons and motivations.\n\nReturns to Friends, family and fools:\nBecause this group is pretty informal, they can give you money in the form of debt (money to be repaid later), equity (they might want a share of your business), or as a gift (no need to repay in any way). Be careful when giving equity to friends and family! There are cases where this works out fine, but going into business with family can be hard and often has negative parts to it.\nAsk: Can anyone see why going into business with friends and family oftentimes goes bad?\nPotential answers:\nYou are stuck with your family! It is not easy to break ties if something goes wrong. Other members of the family might get involved and make it worse\nMix between personal and business life could get overwhelming (always talking about business)\nIt can be difficult to say hard (but often necessary) things to family members or friends\nIt can become unprofessional at times due to the fact that your relationship comes first\n\n\n \n\n\n7\n\nSales \nPromotion\nBOOTSTRAPPING\n5 minutes: Discussion\n\nAnother one of the most common ways to secure funding from your business is “bootstrapping”. Bootstrapping a startup means starting lean and without the help of outside capital. It means continuing to fuel growth internally from cash produced by revenues from the business. Many large businesses start out bootstrapping. It can be hard, but if you really believe in your business, you can make it happen on your own. As you show the market need and real traction, you might be able to take outside investment. Remember, all the options we mentioned so far will expect to see evidence that this is not just an idea, but rather a good investment. \nAsk: How can you begin to bootstrap? \nUse existing resources to invest in your own business\nUse personal finances/savings to invest in your business\nUse operating revenues to reinvest into your business\nGet another job to pay for it (maybe not the best thing to tell the entrepreneurs, but it is an option)\n\nAsk: What are some of the pros and cons of bootstrapping?\nSlow process and might not be able to generate enough revenues\nYou can keep 100% ownership of the business\nSlow growth\n\n8\n\nOTHER FINANCING\n10-15 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAfter doing some research, share funding opportunities available to entrepreneurs in your region.\n\nDiscussion: Did you know that some organizations provide grants or funding opportunities for businesses that focus on improving their operations and long-term sustainability?\nThese funds may come from:\n Government programs\n Financial institution\n Private organizations or investors\n\nThe trainers in the room will probably have some ideas as well so make sure to give them an opportunity to share!\nGo over points such as:\nOrganization name\nFunding range\nApplication process\nTimeline \nEtc…\nIf there are not funding opportunities that you are aware of, share information of organizations that normally fund startups with their typical funding amount and process. \n\nTrainer note: The trainer should research different business and micro loan options available to entrepreneurs in addition to various funding opportunities. Share information about interest rates, requirements, and what the process usually entails. You can share this information with them as a handout in addition to discussing it in the training.\n\n9\n\nWHAT DO THEY WANT?\nOR\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nRemember, these people/organizations all have a motive. Nobody is just giving out money because they feel like it. Therefore, when speaking to these people/organizations, make sure you think about why they are giving money out. In order to make a good deal (or get accepted for the grant/loan), make sure that you know what the other person wants! If you know what they want, you can negotiate better with them. Make sure that you know what the other person wants. To get them to accept your business, you should communicate in a way that is tailored to their needs. Don’t lie, just know the right points to highlight. You can use some of the skills and techniques we learned in the negotiation session here!\nAsk: What do you remember from last week on how to get them to accept you? What are the things that you should consider? \nHow much money are they able to give?\nHow much involvement do they want?\nDay to day involvement\nMonthly updates\nBroader decision making abilities\nSilent relationship\nEtc…\nWhat do they value?\nFinancial returns\nCreating jobs\nSupporting vulnerable people\nThe environment?\nLooking “good” (people who do things just for their ego)\n10\n\nYour Target\n$0\nNo financial limit\nWhat will you do if you don’t win?\nFINANCING STRATEGY\n0$\n1M$\n55 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\n3-5 minutes: Lecture \nYou should be prepared to go to the market with or without seed funding. You have spent the past few months with us developing your product, you have begun to make strategic partnerships, and many of you have begun to make sales! This is amazing. You all have the capability to leave this incubator and continue to make strides on your business.  \nYour Target: Right now, you should have a very clear strategy on how much money you need and what you would use it for. You are all ready to pitch for this amount and have a detailed plan to actually go to market. \n$0: The reality is that there is a strong possibility that you won’t get seed funding from Five One Labs. On Demo Day, we will announce three winners and the rest of you will leave with nothing (it seems harsh, but they should understand the reality). We are here to support you no matter what and help you find funding; however, if you don’t prove to us, investors, or other organizations that your business is feasible and that you have a high likelihood of success, you might not get funded the amount that you need (or at all). That is very much possible. So, what is your plan if you don’t get any seed funding? I want to see that you believe in your idea. If you truly think it will work, you will make it happen even if you have no money in your pocket. \nNo financial limit: What if there was no limit for you? What if there was someone who could invest $1,000,000 into your business? How would you be prepared to deal with this? Although it is important to consider the realities of getting a smaller amount of seed funding, you should be so confident in your business that you could pitch for $100s of thousands of dollars. Big pitch competitions often start with asks around $250k and can go up much more than that. Money is easy to come by; however, great ideas with great founders to implement the ideas are much harder to find. \n\n50 minutes: Activity:\n30 minutes: Individual work:\nTake 30 minutes to write out your financing strategy for each of these options. \nWhat will you do if you get no money at all? How will you go to market?\nHow will you adapt your strategy if you have the opportunity to pitch for all the money you would need to launch?\n\n10-20 minutes: Share: \nGo around the for and have each person share their $0 and $1M strategies\nAllow the cohort to provide feedback to each person (in addition to the trainers feedback).\nMake sure entrepreneurs are really thinking about how they would start with no money. This will be the case for most of them!\n\n\n\nConsider all of your financing opportunities and formalize your strategy to actually launch your business. \nDefine your $0 and $1,000,000,000 strategies\nContinue working on your pitch and business plans!\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS:\n5 minutes: Wrap up\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\n13]]]",

Some starting points could be:\n\nThe International Solar Alliance (which is mentioned in the Green Business Booklet)\nUNDP Iraq's environmental programs\nRegional sustainable development initiatives\nAny government incentives for energy efficiency or renewable energy adoption\n\nThe Green Business Booklet mentions on page 20 that entrepreneurs should \"find out about these schemes and take advantage of them!\" - so providing concrete local information would be extremely valuable.\nIntegration with Business Efficiency Workbook\nLooking at the Business Efficiency Workbook, I notice it already includes space for \"Potential funding sources? Green grants, Investors, etc?\" in the Business Efficiency Plan tab. This suggests there's already a framework for entrepreneurs to consider green funding as part of their efficiency improvements.\nConsider creating a connection between your financing session and this workbook, perhaps by:\n\nReferencing the workbook during your session\nUsing similar terminology for consistency\nEncouraging entrepreneurs to note potential green financing options directly in their efficiency plans\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific suggestions for any part of this assessment?\n]]]",

I'll also include recommendations on how to integrate it with the existing workbook:\n\n---\n\n## Standalone Worksheet: \"Start-Up Capital & Green Funding Opportunities\"\n\n### Purpose:\nIdentify and map funding sources specifically tailored for your business, with a particular focus on green and sustainability incentives.\n\n| Name of Funding Source / Institution | Type of Funding (Loan, Grant, Equity) | Amount Available | Qualification Criteria | Application Deadline | Contact Information / Website |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                      |                                       |                  |                        |                      |                                |\n|                                      |                                       |                  |                        |                      |                                |\n|                                      |                                       |                  |                        |                      |                                |\n|                                      |                                       |                  |                        |                      |                                |\n|                                      |                                       |                  |                        |                      |                                |\n\n### Questions to Guide Your Research:\n- Are there green business incentives (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, grants) available locally or regionally?\n- What international climate finance programs could my business qualify for?\n- Do my business practices or planned improvements align clearly with sustainability criteria required by funders?\n\n---\n\n## How to Integrate with the Efficiency Workbook:\n  \n1. **Reference within the \"Business Efficiency Plan\" Tab:**  \n   - Add a note in the existing workbook under the \"Potential funding sources?\" column, directing entrepreneurs to fill out the standalone worksheet for detailed funding information.\n   - Example integration in the workbook’s cell:\n     > \"Refer to the standalone **Start-Up Capital & Green Funding Opportunities** worksheet to identify detailed funding options.\"\n\n2. **Integration into the \"Action Plan\" Tab:**  \n   - When creating tasks related to sustainability and efficiency (like adding solar panels), explicitly refer to funding identified in the standalone worksheet.\n\n   **Example Entry:**  \n   - **Task:** Add solar panels  \n   - **Cost:** $2,222  \n   - **Funding source:** \"See **Start-Up Capital & Green Funding Opportunities** worksheet for potential funding.\"\n\n3. **Guidance Notes in Facilitator Materials:**  \n   - In the facilitator notes or training slides, clearly instruct entrepreneurs to complete the standalone worksheet during or after the financing session, and emphasize its connection to actionable tasks within their efficiency plans.\n\n---\n\nThis approach allows entrepreneurs to systematically document financing opportunities while maintaining clear alignment and coherence with existing planning tools. Would you like assistance implementing these integrations or further refining this worksheet?",

      "content": "Here's a detailed set of facilitator notes tailored specifically for integrating the **Business Efficiency Workbook**, the **Green Funding Worksheet**, and the **Risk Assessment Worksheet** into your modules:\n\n---\n\n## **Module 9: Cost Model**\n\n**Slide: \"Strategic Efficiency Investments\"**\n\n**Facilitator Notes:** (Detailed)\n\n- Introduce the idea that not all costs are equal—some investments, especially those related to efficiency and sustainability, can significantly lower long-term expenses, reduce risks, and improve resilience.\n- Emphasize the importance of aligning cost management with sustainability efforts. Clearly explain how resource-efficient practices and sustainability investments can save money by reducing waste, energy consumption, and resource use.\n- Direct participants explicitly to the **Business Efficiency Workbook**. Highlight that efficiency improvements like energy efficiency, water conservation, and sustainable sourcing are strategic investments that can result in significant financial and environmental benefits.\n- Ask participants to refer specifically to the **Business Efficiency Checklist** (Power & Equipment, Materials & Waste, Water & Utilities, Transport & Logistics, Supply Chain) to identify high-impact efficiency measures.\n- Point out that some of these measures may be eligible for external green funding and encourage using the standalone **Green Funding Worksheet** to identify financing sources.\n\n---\n\n**Slide 8: \"Business Efficiency Checklist\"** (existing notes, clarified)\n\n**Facilitator Notes:** (Enhanced)\n\n- Introduce the **Business Efficiency Workbook** as a practical tool to integrate sustainability directly into business operations.\n- Highlight key environmental considerations in each checklist category:\n  - **Power & Equipment:** energy efficiency, renewable energy sources (solar panels, efficient equipment).\n  - **Materials & Waste:** waste reduction practices, recycling, and local sourcing.\n  - **Water & Utilities:** water conservation strategies, renewable sources.\n  - **Transport & Logistics:** optimizing routes, using low-emission vehicles or methods.\n  - **Supply Chain:** choosing sustainable suppliers, considering distance and logistics efficiency.\n- Explain clearly how the workbook helps entrepreneurs systematically identify and prioritize efficiency measures, linking sustainability directly with tangible business benefits such as cost reduction, operational resilience, and market competitiveness.\n\n---\n\n## **Module 23: Business Plan**\n\n**Slide 9: \"Green Angle in Your Business Plan\"**\n\n**Facilitator Notes:** (Enhanced)\n\n- Explain clearly that sustainability or a \"green angle\" in a business plan can differentiate their business from competitors and provide distinct competitive advantages.\n- Highlight specific advantages:\n  - **Cost Savings:** Efficient resource use often directly reduces costs (energy efficiency, waste reduction).\n  - **Market Opportunities:** Attracting environmentally conscious consumers, accessing new markets or segments, and appealing to impact investors.\n  - **Value Alignment:** Demonstrating authenticity in aligning their business with personal or organizational values.\n- Ask participants: “If sustainability is relevant to your business, how can it uniquely position you in the market? Could it directly improve profitability, unlock new market segments, or attract mission-aligned investors?”\n- Direct them to the **Green Ideas Brainstorm** handout, reinforcing the prompts from the Green Business Booklet (e.g., “What environmental problems exist in your community?” and “What resources could you use?”).\n\n---\n\n### **Integration of the Risk Assessment Worksheet (Module 23)**\n\nGiven the alignment between sustainability, efficiency, and risk, integrating the **Risk Assessment Worksheet** here makes sense, especially as a subsection of the business planning process.\n\n**Facilitator Notes: (Risk Worksheet Integration)**\n\n- Clearly introduce the **Risk Assessment Worksheet** as part of strategic business planning, emphasizing that identifying risks early allows businesses to proactively mitigate or leverage these risks as opportunities.\n- Highlight how the worksheet allows for systematic evaluation of various risks, such as resource costs, supplier instability, operational stability, market changes, and competitive positioning.\n- Clearly illustrate how identified risks (e.g., high resource costs or market demands for sustainability) can inform targeted efficiency measures (from the **Business Efficiency Workbook**) and justify investments or applications for green funding (via the standalone **Green Funding Worksheet**).\n- Instruct participants explicitly: \n  - \"Complete the Risk Assessment Worksheet, prioritize your risks, and then link these directly to action items in your Business Efficiency Workbook.\"\n  - \"Cross-reference your identified risk mitigation strategies with available green funding opportunities outlined in your Green Funding Worksheet.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Summary:**\n\nTo summarize clearly:\n\n1. **Module 9 (Cost Model):**  \n   - Introduce **Business Efficiency Workbook** and **Green Funding Worksheet** clearly as tools to inform cost efficiency and strategic investment decisions.\n\n2. **Module 23 (Business Plan):**  \n   - Reinforce sustainability as a strategic differentiator.  \n   - Explicitly use the **Green Ideas Brainstorm** handout.  \n   - Integrate **Risk Assessment Worksheet**, clearly showing how managing risks strategically connects to both sustainability and business efficiency measures.\n\nThis detailed integration ensures that sustainability, efficiency, risk management, and financial planning are coherently connected across your modules, providing entrepreneurs with a robust framework for long-term business resilience and success.",

Go through the plane wreckage to salvage five items from the list below.\nDecide your strategy (either to walk to the nearest village, or wait for help).\n\n20 minutes: Activity:\n3-5 minutes: Part 1\nIndividual work \nEach person should rank the importance of each item and choose their top 4 choices\nChoose your strategy (stay put or walk to find the closest town)\n15 minutes: Part 2\nGroup work, after entrepreneurs do it themselves, break them into groups of about 5 people \nAs a group, make a decision on the 5 items you will choose\nAs a group, decide on your strategy (stay put or walk to find the closest town)\n\nHow to score:\nEach team should list its top 5 choices in order prior to seeing the answer sheet. \nTo award points, look at the ranking numbers on this answer sheet. Award points to each team’s top choices according to the numbers here. For example, the map would earn 12 points, while the steel wool would earn 2 points. \nLowest score wins (and survives).\nIf the team wasn’t able to come to a conclusion, they died!\nTypically, if you choose to leave the plane, you will likely freeze and die! It is easy to track a crashed plane, but not as easy to track people lost in the woods.- Bring this up as a point to consider for those who chose to leave. \nConsider giving a small prize to the survivors! Or if anyone “died” in the game, they have to do something nice for the survivors.\n\n\n\nHOW DO YOU MAKE DECISIONS?\n20 minutes: Discussion\n\nDebrief from the activity. Have a discussion on their experience during this “crisis”. \nPotential questions to ask to get the conversation going include: \nWhat did you learn during the activity? What were the consequences of your choices? \n\nWhat roles did group members adopt? \nWas there a leader, a manager, a timekeeper, a facilitator, a slacker, etc… Which roles were helpful and which were not?\nWhat kinds of behavior helped or hindered the group?\nWho influenced the decisions and how?\nDid people listen to each other? If not why not? \n\nWhat are the main differences from when you did it alone or when you did it within the group?\nAlone: Fast, confident, easy, maybe wrong maybe right (depending on the person)\nGroup: Slow, a lot more voices and discussion, harder to make a decision, more ideas, more variety of ideas, better ideas, \n\nHow did your group’s decision-making process affect what you prioritized?\n(Prompt participants to reflect on whether they focused on immediate needs or long-term survival.)\n\nHow were decisions made? How was conflict managed while deciding on what to do?\nVoting\nA leader told everyone what to do\nRandom choices\nEmotionally based choices\nLogical decisions\nDiscussion and agreement\nLook at the facts\nListen to other opinions\nEvaluate pros and cons\n\nWere there trade-offs in your choices?\nExample: Did you sacrifice one priority for another, such as warmth vs. mobility, or safety vs. speed?\n\nDid anyone notice how different people communicated based on the communication aspects that you ranked yourself during the last leadership class?\n\nWhat prevented good decision making? How could better decisions have been made?\nNot enough information available. It would have been good to do research or find an expert on the matter.\nEmotional attachments to one of the solutions (maybe you or a friend came up with the idea, for example)\nTeam members not heard or considered. Anyone on the team could have had a great idea, but if nobody heard you, it is pointless. Consider this point both if you are the loud person (let others speak) and if you are the quiet one (find a way to be heard by speaking up or influencing others who can speak for you)\nFear can impact decisions. Although this isn’t real, if you were in a real crisis, you wouldn’t be able to think clearly.\n\nRecap: The way that you reacted in this game reflects how you would react in real life. The role you played shows who you are on a team (the one who leads, the one who isn’t heard, the one who sits back and lets others decide, etc…). It also shows how you evaluate risk and make decisions in real life. Were you logical and tried to find the right answer? Did you try to appease the group and just settle on something to move on to avoid conflict? Did you prevent a decision from being made because you were stubborn? There is no good or bad in this; however, it is an opportunity to reflect on your style and pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses as a decision maker. \n\nEvery decision you make as an individual, team, or organization has an element of risk involved that will affect your business. Here, your decisions risked your life. In business, your decisions risk other things. Sometimes you have to make quick decisions that could impact your business, your team, your shareholders (if you have any), and your customers.  \n\nAsk: What are some business decisions that can bring risk to your business? Where can they be rewarding and where can the risk cause harm? \nPotential answers: \nHiring the right right/wrong person \nInvesting in parts of your business\nCertain partnerships can be risky/rewarding\nDecisions have an impact on your brand and how people talk about you\nDoing something illegal or socially unaccepted (possibly for quick financial gain)\nChoosing to implement an emergency action plan or not\nChoosing to launch a new product or not can set you apart from your competitors and be rewarding, or it can make you run out of money if it isn’t developed and launched accurately.\nAll of these decisions could impact:\nBrand reputation\nFinancial security and profitability\nCustomer trust\nEmployee trust and commitment\nLegal ramifications\nEtc…\n\nTransition: On one hand, you have risk, but on the other hand you have reward. When you make decisions, there are both elements of risk and reward. The key is to make decisions that are well thought-out and adaptable, so that you can adjust if things don’t go as planned.  For the rest of the session, we will look at risks and how to make decisions while considering the risk involved at each step. By evaluating these risks, you set yourself up for better decision making in the long run. \n\n4\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\nIdentify Risks\nMeasure, Control and Monitor\nAssess and Analyze the Risk\nPlan Action\nImplement\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nEvery decision you make now has an element of risk to it and will impact your business in one way or another. If you have the time to break down your decisions through a risk perspective, you should. Although you can’t predict the future impact of your decisions, you can at least think through the different risk factors and have a plan to adapt to the unexpected quickly.\n\nAsk: What are some business decisions that can bring risk to your business? Where can they be rewarding and where can the risk cause harm? \nPotential answers: \nHiring the right right/wrong person \nInvesting in parts of your business\nCertain partnerships can be risky/rewarding\nDecisions have an impact on your brand and how people talk about you\nDoing something illegal or socially unaccepted (possibly for quick financial gain)\nChoosing to implement an emergency action plan or not\nChoosing to launch a new product or not can set you apart from your competitors and be rewarding, or it can make you run out of money if it isn’t developed and launched accurately.\nAll of these decisions could impact:\nBrand reputation\nFinancial security and profitability\nCustomer trust\nEmployee trust and commitment\nLegal ramifications\nSupply chain stability\nOperational costs\nEtc…\n\nRecap: Each decision has an opportunity to reward you or hurt you and the future of your business. That depends on the riskiness of the decision you are making. It is your job to be able to evaluate these risks and figure out what the best strategic move to make is.  Each of you should have a plan for risk mitigation and management. Risk management is all about thinking ahead to try to understand what might cause an issue, then take the steps necessary to avoid the problem and reduce losses wherever you can. \n\nRisk management steps to help guide you through the process of creating a risk management plan include:\nIdentify risks: Define the problems and risks that might arise for your business. There are some obvious ones, and some that are less obvious. You should think about your business to see where there are higher opportunities for risk. Each business will face different ones. \nAssess and analyze the risk: Look at each of the risks you have identified. Try to prioritize them and see which ones are the riskiest and could cause the most harm. Evaluate them through factors that you consider to be important. \nPlan action: Make a decision on what to do. Common decisions include:  \nDo nothing. This can be an option and it is totally fine. Make sure you really understand the situation before you choose to “do nothing”.\nWait for the risky event to happen and have a plan to fix it\nMitigate the risk altogether. \nImplement: Implement whatever it is you decided to do. If it is a mitigation strategy start it. If it is just waiting for it to occur, make sure that everyone on the team knows how to respond when/if it does.\nMeasure, control, and monitor: Monitor the situation. Whether you implemented a risk mitigation strategy or chose to ignore the risk (because it wasn’t risky enough to implement something), make sure that you don’t forget about your decision. \nIt is a cycle and you should continue to look ahead to spot future risks so that you can plan accordingly.\n\n\nWhen identifying risks, businesses can categorize them under three main areas:\nPeople: Employee well-being, customer safety, and the impact of business decisions on staff and community.\nProduct: Product quality, demand fluctuations, supply chain reliability, and risks related to sourcing materials.\nPlanet: Resource dependency, operational costs, and external risks like energy prices or environmental regulations.\n\nPotential questions:\nHow does the risk management process tie into decision making? When you have to make a decision, you are presented with a series of alternative actions you can make. Each alternative has a different level of risk and reward. You should assess the risk- reward of each of those options and make a decision. Once you decide on a course of action, make a plan for mitigating some of those risks that you thought of before. Monitor your decision so you know if you need to step in and make a change at any point.\n5\n\nRISK PLANNING\nYou are starting a tourism business, what are the internal and external risks you might face for the first 6 months of operation? \n15-20 minutes: Brainstorm\n\nHave a brainstorm on the board with the class. Give a business situation and determine what the risks a business might face. Go through all of the steps that would be needed to fill out the tool as a discussion on the board.\nAsk: What kind of risks might you find for this example?\nPotential answers:\nMarket risks due to competition\nWell known tourism agencies reduce their prices when I can’t.\nNew competition enters the market making the current marketing plans obsolete.\nPeople follow the trend and go online making my primary sales channel obsolete. \nInexperienced marketing and sales team cause low brand awareness and sales. \n\nTechnical risks related to the technical side of the business\nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one)\nCar breaks down so you can’t go on tours\n\nLegal risks \nUnexpected changes or new regulations on tourism\nDanger of being sued if someone gets injured on your tour\nAn important contract is broken\n\nNatural risks related to climate and natural disasters.\nGlobal pandemics (COVID 19, for example)\nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible\nEarthquakes or fires affecting the team and the office\n\nOperational risks related to delivering your product/service to the customer\nTour guide gets sick and can’t go on tours\nPartner organization (that organizes flights, for example) closes or raise their prices so you can use them anymore\nTerrorism and violence is always a possibility that can have an impact on the market and how you operate within the situation.\nHigh dependency on a single supplier or resource, making operations vulnerable to delays or shortages\n\nFinancial risks: \nRun out of cash\nSomething breaks down and you need to replace it unexpectedly\nCustomer refuses to pay you after you spent money on delivering a tour\nIncreasing costs of raw materials or services that directly impact pricing strategy.\n\n\nAfter you pinpointed several risks for the business, choose a few to focus on and go through the points reflected on the tool described on the next slides. \nWrite all the answers on the board. An example of outcomes from the discussion are shown below.\nAsk the following questions for each risk:\nWhat is the likelihood of it actually happening? \nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one): Very high likelihood due to the early stage of the app\nRun out of cash: High likelihood since it is an early stage startup\nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible: Low likelihood. Temperatures and weather have been stable and predictable the past several years. \nA key supplier stops providing materials, affecting production: Medium likelihood, especially if no backup plan is in place.\n\nWhat is the financial impact on your business if this happens?\nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one): Low impact. We have several sales channels to if the app doesn’t work, the business will be ok. We also have a CTO that can fix bugs free of charge. \nRun out of cash: High impact. I will have to reduce staff and marketing which will lower customers and sales. \nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible: High impact. Outdoor tours are a big part of what we do especially for international clients; however, tours with locals . \nA sudden rise in material costs increases product/service pricing: Medium to high impact, depending on how price-sensitive customers are.\n\nWhen might this risk actually happen? \nThere are technical problems with the application (if you have one): It is an immediate risk because the product hasn’t been tested much. \nRun out of cash. It is a low risk: We have a firm cash management plan and funding secured for the next year and a half.\nInclement weather that makes tourism not possible: Long term risk. Temperatures and weather have been stable; however, there is evidence the climate change will have a big impact in the coming years. \nSupply chain delays due to external disruptions: Medium risk—global trends in logistics and shipping can affect material availability.\n\n\n\nRISK EVALUATION:\n5 minutes: Demonstration\n\nGo onto the excel sheet and demonstrate how to use the risk evaluation document. \nTake 2-3 examples that you did on the board and put them into the matrix to see what the impact score is. \nMake sure to highlight:\nWhat each term means in each category\nHow the score is added up\nHow to change the scoring and categories by changing options on sheet 2. Simple changes on sheet 2 will automatically change on sheet 1 (it is more complicated to add rows or categories. If you do, just follow the formulas in the other categories or ask for help)\nThis is relative, and not 100% accurate. A risk should be evaluated from many perspectives and each perspective has a different weight in terms of importance. Don’t just rely on this. This is a very quantitative view of the process; however, don’t forget about a qualitative reflection as well. Think about all of the other factors that need to be considered before making a plan.\nThis can be adapted in other ways and you don’t always have to use this exact matrix. When you have a decision to make, or you are evaluating risk, think of a few key points that you want to evaluate, weigh their importance, and compare alternatives. You see how we did it on the board together, you can do that again in real life\n\n\nRISK EVALUATION:\n5 minutes: Demonstration\n\nGo onto the excel sheet and demonstrate how to use the risk evaluation document. \nTake 2-3 examples that you did on the board and put them into the matrix to see what the impact score is. \nHow risk categories are structured in your assessment\nExplain how risks are categorized (e.g., Resource Costs, Supply Security, Market Changes).\nIntroduce the 3Ps framework (People, Product, Planet) as a way to analyze risks comprehensively.\nHow risks are scored in your assessment\nShow how to assign scores for Severity, Likelihood, and Priority.\nNew Addition: Introduce Impact Areas as a factor to measure risks tied to waste, supply chain dependencies, and operational inefficiencies.\nHighlight how different risks (e.g., high electricity costs, supplier instability) are evaluated based on their financial, operational, and efficiency impact.\nHow the scoring system informs decision-making\nExplain how high-priority risks should be addressed first.\n\nSET A PLAN!\n35 minutes: Lecture + activity\n\n3-5 minutes: Lecture\nYou can explain this on the board or continue the demonstration from the previous slide.\nNext is all about implementing a strategy and monitoring the risk over time.\nNow you need to make a decision on what to do. For each of your major risks, you should have a plan to deal with the situation.\nThe trainer should go through each category and explain why it is an important aspect of the risk mitigation process:\nAction plan: Don’t just go with the first option you think of. Carefully evaluate your options and alternatives if something were to happen. Write your action plan that will help you mitigate this risk or make a plan for if this were to happen.\nAsk: What are the things you might want to consider when deciding what to do for this situation?\nPotential answers:\nAssociated costs\nImpact on brand and reputation\nTime needed to implement this plan\nPeople needed to be able to implement the plan\nResponsibility: Once you decide what the best course of action is, highlight who would be involved in implementing this if it were to happen. You should actually speak to the team member to get them on board so that they know what their responsibility is ahead of time. \nAction plan status: What steps are you putting in place for this risk (if anything)? If there are steps you are putting into place now, put some dates on when you want it complete. When do you plan on re-evaluating this risk? \n\n30 minutes: Activity\nEntrepreneurs should think about the risks associated with their business and come up with some strategies to mitigate these risks or deal with them if/when they arise. \nThink about immediate risks first, but don’t forget about the risks that might arise down the line as well.\nThe trainer will be around to help entrepreneurs think through risks directly related to their business\n\nCRISIS MANAGEMENT\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nRight now, you all have a very nice plan. You have a clear budget, timeline, strategy, and a framework to evaluate and mitigate risks. As we discussed earlier, you can mitigate many of these risks through careful planning; however, sometimes things happen, and we are put in a challenging position where we can’t meet our targets because something unexpected happens. When you launch your business, you might face a crisis that you just don’t know how to deal with. If you are not prepared to adapt to the situation, this could devastate your business.  \t\n\nAsk: How can you prepare for the unexpected? What would you do in a sudden crisis? (Take Coronavirus or war for example if people can’t think of anything)\nPotential answers:\nChange your strategy\nLearn about your customers main needs during this time\nThink about how your business can have a positive impact on the overall situation\nCut costs where you can\nChange prices/revenue streams\nRenegotiate contracts\nCreate policies and a work environment that is flexible and responsive to change\nCreate a system to communicate information quickly to employees, partners, suppliers, and customers in the event that it is needed\nEtc…\n\nRecap: You need to re-evaluate, re-plan, and take action. You should not quit or take a break, it is time to stand out and make a bigger impact. Adapt your business in every way necessary.\n10\n\nIdentify where you are in the situation \n\nStop the bleeding\n\nAdd value and innovate!\n\nWHAT TO DO WHEN CRISIS HITS\n10-15 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk:  When crisis hits, what are specific things that you can do to protect your business? \nAllow for entrepreneurs to answer freely, but make sure to touch on the points on the slide as well. \nIdentify where you are in the situation: The first thing we have to do is think about where we are. What are all resources we have? What do we do well? Where are opportunities for us to add value. Where are we suffering the most? \nFor example, you might have:\nGreat following on social media\n3 staff members I have to pay but can’t afford\nI have a lot of operational costs I have to keep up\nEmployees are lost and don’t know what to do \nI have a lot of inventory\nClients are reaching out and want to buy, but I can’t deliver my product/service\n\nStop the bleeding: After you identify, where you are suffering, make a plan to stop unnecessary spending and get your situation under control. Basically, cut costs.\nPaid marketing might not be the best idea right now, and is expensive. Switch to organic marketing. It is cheaper and you can use this time to incorporate more content marketing or value added marketing (this could actually help you build a stronger customer base in the end). \nLet go of employees if you must.\nRe-negotiate contracts and deals. Don’t let bills pile up, try to cut costs where you can. \nPartner with competitors if you have to\n\nAdd value and innovate: Entrepreneurs should ask themselves “How could I be a winner in this?”. Add value that can transition into new sales, new customers, new revenue streams, and more.\nManage your community, call your customers, and strengthen relationships\nFollow trends. Where is the crisis forcing you to go? See if you can follow it instead of fight it.\nFor example, during COVID 19, many traditional business had to shut down because nobody could go out. However, there were many successful business that survived COVID because they were able to transition online quickly (that’s where the market went). \nAdapt your products/services to meet the needs of the current situation.\n\nRecap: You need to be adaptable in all areas of your business. You must be able to adapt your marketing, operational, and strategic plan to reflect the current situation. You can always shift back when the situation is back to normal (or maybe you change for the better and keep some innovative changes). \nWhen you are in this type of situation, always think:\nHow should I be marketing right now? \nHow can I be operating right now? \nWhat is my strategy, to get through this situation?\nWhat do my customers really need right now? \n11\n\nCRISIS MANAGEMENT\n“Never let a good crisis go to waste”\n- Winston Churchill\n20 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\nAsk: What do you think of this quote?\nAllow entrepreneurs to share their thoughts on this quote. \nThere is opportunity in every situation. When there is a crisis, people are in need. It is the role of your business to relieve the pain, frustration, and find innovative solutions. Businesses solve problems and make customers’ lives easier. When people are suffering, there is so much opportunity to make things better!\nYou are forced to innovate by finding creative ways to cut costs and add value.\nWhen there is a crisis, innovative companies are the ones who take us out of the situation and make things better. \n\nRecap:\nWhen you are in a crisis, don’t panic or make rushed decisions. Instead:\nFirst, focus on survival: Identify the immediate problems and take action to stabilize the business.\nThen, regroup and reassess: Once things are under control, look at what can be adjusted.\nFinally, explore how you can use the crisis as an opportunity: Businesses that adapt their operations strategically can often come out stronger.\n“A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”  - Winston Churchill\n\n[[original version - Recap: When you are in a crisis, don’t break down and make risky decisions. Think logically and find the opportunity in the situation. First, we have to survive and stop the bleeding. Then you need to get yourself together and regroup. Think about how you can actually grow and take advantage of the situation! “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”  - Winston Churchill ]]]\n\n15 minutes: Activity\n10 minutes: Group discussion\nBreak into groups of 3-5 people\nAsk: How is risk management connected with decision making? (Encourages discussion on how crisis decisions require balancing risk and opportunity.)\nAsk: What decisions need to be made immediately when there is a crisis? (Focus on short-term vs. long-term decision-making.)\nAsk: Who will be in charge of implementing those decisions? (Encourages thinking about leadership and delegation in high-pressure situations.)\n\n5 minutes: Share\nBring everyone back to the room and discuss:\nWhat were some of the key takeaways from your discussion?\n12\n\nTHANK YOU!\nANY QUESTIONS?\nWrap up: 5 minutes!\n13\n]]]",

      "content": "Here's a comprehensive, structured approach on how to cohesively integrate the **Business Efficiency Workbook**, **Risk Assessment Worksheet**, and sustainability/climate resilience themes into the existing **Risk and Crisis Management slides** without explicitly overemphasizing the \"green\" aspects:\n\n---\n\n### **Updated Facilitator Notes and Slide Integration Recommendations:**\n\n## Slide: Settle in (9:00)\n(No significant change required.)\n\n---\n\n## Slide: Begin the session (9:15)\n(No significant change required.)\n\n---\n\n## Slide: Objectives\n(Briefly integrate subtle climate resilience)\n- Reflect on your decision-making style, identify strengths and weaknesses.\n- Develop an initial risk management strategy adaptable to changing circumstances (e.g., climate impacts, market shifts).\n- Learn strategies to adapt swiftly and innovatively during crises.\n\n---\n\n## Slide: Plane Crash Activity\n(No significant change, but consider framing as a metaphor for external disruptions including climate-related risks.)\n\n---\n\n## Slide: HOW DO YOU MAKE DECISIONS?\n(Add subtle prompts on long-term thinking)\n**Facilitator notes addition:**\n- During discussion, gently introduce the importance of balancing short-term survival (immediate decisions) and long-term resilience (climate, market shifts, sustainability).\n- Prompt participants: \"Did your group consider long-term impacts or focus only on immediate survival? How might considering longer-term sustainability have influenced your choices?\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide: RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS (New Integration)\n**Facilitator notes addition:**\n- Clearly explain how sustainability and climate-related factors fit naturally into risk management (without explicitly labeling them as \"green\"):\n  - **Identify Risks:** Mention long-term operational risks including resource scarcity, energy price volatility, regulatory changes, or environmental disruptions.\n  - **Assess and Analyze:** Use the **Risk Assessment Worksheet**. Explain how businesses might evaluate risks related to resources, operations, and supply chains using criteria provided (impact on cost, operations, reputation).\n  - **Plan Action:** Encourage using efficiency measures (reference **Business Efficiency Workbook**) to proactively mitigate resource-related risks like rising costs or disruptions.\n  - **Implement & Monitor:** Reinforce how ongoing monitoring of identified risks helps businesses stay adaptive and resilient, especially against external disruptions.\n\n---\n\n## Slide: RISK PLANNING (Brainstorm Activity)\n**Facilitator notes addition:**\n- Integrate subtle sustainability prompts in the example provided:\n  - Market Risks: Changing consumer preferences towards eco-friendly services/products.\n  - Technical Risks: Technology failures impacting operational efficiency (e.g., energy, water management).\n  - Legal Risks: Introduction of new environmental or sustainability regulations.\n  - Natural Risks: Increasing frequency of climate-related disruptions (storms, floods, heatwaves).\n  - Operational Risks: Dependency on non-local supply chains vulnerable to disruption.\n  - Financial Risks: Rising energy and resource costs impacting profit margins.\n\n**Example added facilitator prompt:**  \n*\"Could some of these risks be reduced or managed by improving business efficiency? For instance, if energy costs or supplier reliability are identified risks, how might efficiency improvements (as detailed in your Business Efficiency Workbook) reduce these risks?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Slide: RISK EVALUATION (Demonstration)\n**Facilitator notes addition (updated clearly):**\n- Demonstrate the **Risk Assessment Worksheet** explicitly:\n  - Categorize risks clearly under **People, Product, Planet**:\n    - **People:** Employee and customer well-being, community acceptance.\n    - **Product:** Supply reliability, cost and quality management.\n    - **Planet:** Risks related to resource availability, energy costs, environmental disruptions.\n- Clearly illustrate how risks impacting business efficiency (such as resource costs and operational inefficiencies) can be quantitatively scored using the provided worksheet.\n- Show how scoring helps prioritize risk management actions, linking directly to efficiency investments outlined in the **Business Efficiency Workbook**.\n\n---\n\n## Slide: SET A PLAN!\n**Facilitator notes addition (updated clearly):**\n- Explicitly link identified risks to concrete actions within the **Business Efficiency Workbook**:\n  - Prompt participants clearly to consider strategic investments that reduce risks (energy efficiency, local sourcing, waste reduction).\n  - Ask explicitly:  \n    *\"Could any identified risk be mitigated through better resource efficiency or operational improvements? If so, record your action plan clearly in your Business Efficiency Workbook.\"*\n- Highlight the potential role of external funding (reference the **Green Funding Worksheet** subtly, mentioning it as \"specialized financing\") to implement risk mitigation actions.\n\n---\n\n## Slide: CRISIS MANAGEMENT\n**Facilitator notes addition:**\n- When discussing adapting to crises, subtly highlight the importance of having flexible, resource-efficient, and resilient business practices:\n  - \"Crisis situations often reveal the vulnerabilities of traditional business practices. Resource-efficient businesses typically find it easier to adapt and recover faster.\"\n- Mention clearly but indirectly that businesses prepared with efficiency measures and contingency plans (as suggested by the Business Efficiency Workbook and Risk Assessment Worksheet) are more resilient.\n\n---\n\n## Slide: WHAT TO DO WHEN CRISIS HITS\n**Facilitator notes addition (enhanced subtly):**\n- Reinforce subtly that efficiency and sustainability measures are naturally advantageous during crises:\n  - \"Reducing waste, using resources efficiently, or partnering locally can help businesses survive tough times by lowering operating costs and dependencies on unstable supply chains.\"\n- Clearly encourage entrepreneurs to innovate by asking themselves:\n  - \"Could improving efficiency or reducing resource use create immediate savings or a stronger market position during the crisis?\"\n\n---\n\n## Slide: CRISIS MANAGEMENT QUOTE DISCUSSION\n**Facilitator notes addition (clearly subtle):**\n- Clearly frame crisis as an opportunity for innovation and resilience-building without explicitly emphasizing sustainability:\n  - \"Every crisis is an opportunity to rethink operations, streamline processes, and position your business to emerge stronger. Consider how efficiency improvements or restructured operations could help you grow through adversity.\"\n\n---\n\n## **Integration and Cohesion Summary:**\n- **Risk Assessment Worksheet:** Explicitly demonstrated within the \"Risk Evaluation\" slide to quantify and prioritize risks.\n- **Business Efficiency Workbook:** Naturally integrated throughout risk and crisis management slides to highlight how efficiency investments proactively reduce operational and financial risks.\n- **Green Funding Worksheet:** Mentioned subtly as \"specialized financing\" to support strategic risk mitigation investments.\n- **Climate Resilience and Sustainability:** Embedded subtly throughout without explicit “green” labeling—framing it as common-sense business resilience and efficiency.\n\nThis clearly structured yet subtly integrated approach aligns with your client’s preferences, effectively embedding sustainability and climate resilience elements within the session in a practical, natural, and non-explicit manner.",

      "content": "Based on your Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW), here's how you could effectively update and align the **Risk and Crisis Management** module (specifically the \"Set a Plan!\" slide) to cohesively integrate with the workbook's existing action planning framework:\n\n---\n\n### Revised \"Set a Plan!\" Slide Content:\n\n#### **35 minutes: Lecture + Activity**\n\n### **Lecture (5 minutes):**\n\nNow that you've identified and evaluated your risks, it’s time to develop clear, actionable plans to manage them effectively. Using your **Business Efficiency Workbook** will help you formalize your risk mitigation strategies alongside other business improvement actions, allowing you to address multiple areas efficiently.\n\nHere’s how to align your risk planning process with your workbook:\n\n- **Action Plan:** Clearly outline the steps you will take if a risk becomes reality. Carefully evaluate multiple alternatives, considering factors such as:\n  - **Associated costs**\n  - **Impact on your brand and reputation**\n  - **Time and resources needed for implementation**\n  - **Alignment with your overall efficiency and sustainability goals**\n\n- **Responsibility:** Assign responsibility clearly. The workbook prompts you to designate who will carry out each action, ensuring accountability and clear communication within your team.\n\n- **Funding Considerations:** Within the BEW, specifically under \"Potential funding sources,\" consider noting if your risk mitigation actions can leverage green funding or sustainability-oriented incentives. Linking your risks and efficiency improvements can open additional financing pathways.\n\n- **Expected Benefits and ROI:** Identify clear outcomes expected from each action (e.g., reduced costs, improved reliability, enhanced customer trust), which you can track within the BEW.\n\n- **Action Plan Status:** The BEW provides a structure to set deadlines, track the status of each action, and monitor progress regularly. Clearly indicate:\n  - What steps you’re putting in place immediately\n  - When you will review or re-evaluate these actions\n\n---\n\n### **Activity (30 minutes):**\n\n- Entrepreneurs should use their BEW to document the risks they've identified today. Specifically, they should:\n  - Add key identified risks into the **Business Efficiency Plan**.\n  - Outline the actions needed to address these risks under the relevant efficiency areas (Power & Equipment, Supply Chain, Transport & Logistics, etc.).\n  - Fill out the \"Priority,\" \"Assigned To,\" \"Cost,\" \"Expected Benefits/ROI,\" and \"Potential Funding Sources\" columns to have a structured overview.\n\n- Guide entrepreneurs to:\n  - Prioritize their risk-mitigation actions using the BEW prioritization matrix to balance urgency, cost, and potential impact.\n  - Discuss with their team (if present) or the trainer to refine these actions, ensuring practical, actionable steps that can realistically be implemented.\n\n- Facilitators should move around the room, assisting entrepreneurs in thinking strategically about how addressing risks can simultaneously enhance business efficiency and sustainability, aligning with their broader business strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Facilitator’s Notes:\n\n- Demonstrate briefly how the **Business Efficiency Workbook** can help visualize risk-related action plans. Show:\n  - How actions are documented clearly in the BEW.\n  - How each task can contribute to greater operational efficiency, cost reduction, or improved sustainability.\n  - Highlight practical examples such as:\n    - Adding solar panels (reducing energy costs and mitigating power outage risks).\n    - Finding local suppliers (reducing supply chain risks while improving sustainability).\n    - Adjusting inventory practices (managing financial risk through better resource management).\n\n- Emphasize the integration of risk management and business efficiency/sustainability goals as a holistic practice—not isolated activities.\n\n---\n\nThis approach ensures a seamless integration between your risk management teaching module and the Business Efficiency Workbook, creating a cohesive, practical, and sustainability-focused strategy for entrepreneurs.",

      "content": "The facilitator notes for \"Risk Evaluation\" align quite well with the next slide, but we can streamline and simplify the transition to clarify the process of transferring actions from the Risk Worksheet into the Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW). Here's how you can seamlessly connect and simplify both slides:\n\n---\n\n### Updated Facilitator Notes for Risk Evaluation Slide:\n(5 minutes: Demonstration)\n\n**Step-by-Step Demonstration**  \n- **Categories:** Explain the risk categories (e.g., Resource Costs, Supply Security, Market Changes), highlighting the \"3Ps\" (People, Product, Planet).\n- **Scoring:** Demonstrate clearly how to score risks using:\n  - **Severity:** (1–3, Low to High)\n  - **Likelihood:** (1–3, Unlikely to Almost certain)\n  - **Timeframe:** (1–3, Long-term to Immediate)\n  - **Priority:** Calculated automatically (Severity x Likelihood x Timeframe).\n\n- **Decision Making:** \n  - Highlight that **high-priority risks (Priority score ≥ 6)** need immediate attention.\n  - Clearly state these risks will be transferred to the **Business Efficiency Workbook** for actionable planning.\n\n**Quick Example**  \n- Risk: \"High electricity costs\"  \n  - Severity: 3, Likelihood: 3, Timeframe: 3  \n  - Priority: 27 (High Priority)  \n  - Action: \"Install solar panels\" (Transferred to BEW)\n\n---\n\n### Streamlined Facilitator Notes for \"Set a Plan!\" Slide:\n(35 minutes: Lecture + Activity)\n\n**3–5 minutes: Lecture - From Risk to Efficiency Action**  \nNow you’ll move from identifying priority risks to actionable improvements. Using the risks identified earlier, transfer these into your **Business Efficiency Workbook (BEW)**.\n\n**Process Overview:**  \n- Identify **top priority risks** from your Risk Worksheet (Priority ≥ 6).\n- Transfer these risks into the BEW's **\"Business Efficiency Checklist\"** tab under \"Challenges.\"\n- Clearly specify actions in the column **\"Business Improvement Actions.\"**\n- Commit to these actions using the BEW’s \"Business Efficiency Plan\" section.\n\n**Key Points to Explain:**  \n- Clearly explain the term alignment:\n  - Risk Worksheet → BEW Checklist  \n  - \"Ideas for Actions Needed\" → \"Business Improvement Actions\"\n- Factors to guide actions:\n  - Cost and expected benefits (ROI)\n  - Timeline and team responsibility\n  - Multi-risk or efficiency benefits (e.g., solar panels addressing both electricity costs and outages)\n\n**30 minutes: Activity – Integrated Planning**  \n- **Step 1 (15 min): Identify & Prioritize**  \n  - Identify **3 top risks** from your Risk Worksheet.  \n  - Decide on clear, actionable steps (e.g., \"Install backup systems\" for outages, \"Find local suppliers\" for supply stability).\n\n- **Step 2 (15 min): Transfer & Commit**  \n  - Move these risks and actions to your BEW:\n    - Checklist tab: Enter risks as **\"Challenges\"** and clearly defined actions under **\"Business Improvement Actions.\"**\n    - Plan tab: Define clearly who will execute the actions (\"Assigned To\"), costs involved, timelines, and potential funding sources (e.g., green grants).\n\n**Trainer Note:**  \nEncourage practical efficiency-driven solutions and guide participants to use Module 29’s funding resources to support their chosen actions.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works:  \n- **Clear terminology alignment** ensures entrepreneurs easily understand where and how to document actions.\n- **Simple, step-by-step instruction** reduces confusion and emphasizes actionable outcomes.\n- Explicitly connecting risk assessment with practical efficiency actions provides a cohesive experience.\n\nThis streamlined and simplified integration provides clarity, reinforcing the connection between risk assessment and efficiency planning, making your session smoother and more practical.",

Although this wont be a heavy session, we will cover very important points that all entrepreneurs should know about in this context we are operating in. \n1\n\nGo over some entrepreneurship and tech trends around the world and in the MENA region, \nIdentify challenges and opportunities in the region and place your business in the current context,\nDiscuss the different key actors in the region and brainstorm ways to work with the current players.\n1 minute: Objectives\n\nGo over some entrepreneurship and tech trends around the world and in the MENA region, \nIdentify challenges and opportunities in the region and place your business in the current context,\nDiscuss the different key actors in the region and brainstorm ways to work with the current players.\n\n\nMENA CONTEXT\n15 minutes: Discussion\n\nUp to this point, you all have been through Ignite, you have done research, you have spoken to business people, and you have been working on your businesses for a while now. \nAsk: How do you see the landscape? Is this business environment conducive to starting a business? What are some of the challenges and opportunities that you see?\nPotential answers might include points that are on the following slides or topics that aren’t mentioned at all. Let the conversation flow even if it will repeat points later on. \n\nCHALLENGES IN IRAQ\nLegal barriers\nOnline Payments\nKnowledge & skills gap\nLack of Funding\nBusiness Operational Challenges\n4\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nRecap from the brainstorm earlier to highlight these points:\nLegal barriers: There is an unclear legal process for startups. Especially tech businesses have a very difficult time registering their businesses because there is no official legal framework that innovative businesses fit into.\nOnline Payments: The challenge is that not many people actually use these systems. Therefore, businesses don’t usually integrate them into their business model. The more frequently that businesses offer the opportunities to use them, the more likely people will use them. \nKnowledge & skills gap: There are some technical skills gaps here. Coding talent for example is rare to find. Either people are recently learning and are a it inexperienced, or they are so expensive because they are the only options available. \nLack of Funding: Most of the funding for startups has been coming from NGOs or outside organizations. Banks offer very high interest rates so it can be unreasonable for a startup to take out a loan and survive under the debt. Investment is rare as well, but there has been an increasing number of local and international investment interest in the past few years!\nBusiness Operational Challenges: Many startups struggle with inefficiencies in supply chains, logistics, and process management, making it harder to scale.\n\n4\n\nOPPORTUNITIES IN IRAQ\n5\nEconomic growth\nMarket gaps\nInternational interest\nIncreasing local investment\nPassionate youth\n3 minutes: Lecture\n\nAlthough there are some obvious challenges and hurdles that you guys have to get through, there are many opportunities as well.\nRecap from the brainstorm earlier to highlight these points:\nEconomic growth: As the economy strengthens, there is more disposable income and more free flowing money. We can see that the economy is starting to bounce back which shows a high probability that we will see faster business growth and even more investments. \nMarket gaps: With visible market gaps, there are clear areas of opportunity. The more challenges that are around is directly correlated with the amount of opportunities. Additionally, because Iraq lags behind some other countries in filling these gaps, there is an opportunity to mimic best practices and apply concepts here.\nIncreasing international interest: As we saw in the previous slides, there has been a clear growth of investment in the region. Although those numbers were regional and not based in Iraq, it is showing that people are interested. These investments are starting to trickle over here as we are starting to see more and more interest from international and local investment deals being made, plus more of an interest from other organizations such as the world bank.\nIncreasing local investment: 2019 was a record year by number of deals in MENA-based startups - The MENA region surpassed 550 deals for the first time ever - The number of deals increased by 31% in the MENA region from 2018 to 2019. 70-75% of these investments are actually from regional investors and not international (this information is from Magnitt, an online resource with lots of regional research and data). It is really great to see the regional investors growing in numbers because you need to have local buy in on startups. Local investors typically have a better understanding of the local context and could be a better source of support for a local business.\nPassionate youth interested in entrepreneurship: A huge opportunity is the fact that there are so many people who are interested in entrepreneurship. You guys (the entrepreneurs sitting in the room) are the ones that are going to bring new and innovative solutions to todays problems. There are s many of you applying to our programs, going through Ignite, joining webinars, working with our partner organizations, etc… You all have so many great ideas. As long as there are passionate people with ideas, there are so many opportunities.\n5\n\nINVESTMENT IN MENA\nGrowing investments\nCOVID impacted investment\nEgypt leads investment\n$251M\n$210M\n$261M\n$140M\n$43M\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nLets take a look at the MENA region and see what investment actually looks like here.\nGive some key highlights of the Magnitt 2020 investment report:\n$277M was invested in 108 startup investment deals in MENA, an increase of 2% in total funding from Q1 '19 to Q1 '20;\nA 22% drop in number of deals from Q1 '19 to Q1 '20;\nMarch saw a significant drop in deal announcements due to the spread of COVID-19.\nA staggering majority (82%) of all investments in the first quarter were at the early stage. The report highlights a gradual increase in later-stage deals since 2015, suggesting that the ecosystem is maturing.\nHowever, there is no doubt that pandemic took its toll on the quarter. March alone saw a 67% decrease in number of deals compared to March 2019, as an early sign of the COVID-19 impact on investments.\nCompared to last year’s H1 report, MAGNiTT has pointed out an increase of 66% in total funding and 28% in number of deals, while, in terms of sectors, fintech maintains its top position as the most active industry with 17% of the deals made, followed by e-commerce at 12%, and delivery and transport at 8%. \n\nAsk: What do you think are the factors that typically affect investment? What about right things happening right now? \nGlobal political factors\nGlobal economy\nCoronavirus: While investors highlighted to MAGNiTT that they are still actively looking to invest, the true ramifications of the crisis are not expected to be seen until several months after the start of the crisis. The fundraising exercise often takes several months for founders and investors, delaying the impact of the current situation. \n\nMost information is from this report: https://magnitt.com/news/51728/magnitt-intelligence-q1-2020-increase-funding-deals-took-hit-march\n\n\n\n6\n\nINVESTMENT IN MENA\n7\nTHE TOP 5 FUNDING ROUNDS ACCOUNTED FOR 61% OF ALL MENA STARTUP FUNDING IN Q1 2020\n5 minutes: Discussion + lecture\n\nRead the text on the slide: “The top 5 funding rounds accounted for 61% of all MENA startup funding in Q1 2020.\nAsk: What does this mean? \nMost of the money is going to a few players. \nThese companies are getting huge deals, but that isn’t the norm\nit can be seen that the majority of the top 5 funding rounds were announced before the crisis forced many countries into lockdown. Kitopi, Vezeeta, and SellAnyCar, who together raised $135M, all raised their funding rounds in February 2020, with only Halan announcing its funding round during the lockdown period.\n\nShare some information about these regional success stories: \nKitopi: Cloud kitchen platform that partners with restaurants to expand their reach based in Dubai\nVezeeta: Healthcare booking platform based in Egypt.\nSellanycar.com: A site to buy and sell cars based in Dubai\nNana: Online grocery platform based in Saudi Arabia\nHalan: Ride hailing app that also does logistics and deliveries for businesses based in Egypt.\n\nAsk: What are the leading factors leading to investment in 2020? What businesses are being invested in now? \nIn a recent report that Magnitt published, figures show that $277 million were invested in the Middle Eastern startup ecosystem in Q1 Y2020. \nThe Egyptian ecosystem enjoyed the biggest chunk of deals, accounting for 37% of deals that occurred during the past three months, followed by the United Arab Emirates that accounted for 25%. Startups based in the UAE raised 51% of total funding in the quarter, followed by those based in Egypt who raised 27%. \nMeanwhile, startups based in the emerging entrepreneurial empire of Saudi Arabia accounted for 10% of overall funding, mainly attributed to Nana’s $18 million deal.\nAccording to the report, the UAE is the most active ecosystem in the region, having secured 26% of the deals made in H1, followed by Egypt at 21%, and Lebanon at 13%. MAGNiTT has earmarked Saudi Arabia as one of the fastest growing ecosystems, having recorded 26 investments for the same period.\nIn the time of coronavirus it comes by no surprise that Fin-tech remains on top of the ecosystem, in its grip 15% of investment deals in the past three months. With almost a tie, Delivery & Transport follows, then comes E-commerce with 13% of the deals and Food & Beverage with 9%.\nSpeaking of which, the Food & Beverage industry witnessed the highest total funding of $74 million, making up 27% of funding in the MENA region – thanks to Kitopi’s $60 million deal.\n\nWhat these startups are saying:\nHalan: He explained that there are no tech-based competitors providing services to their target market, “We’re really competing with the local tuk-tuk drivers and the local stores that sell products. We want to be present in every village in the country.” Halan’s CEO in his Wired interview said that they expect to break even in 2024 with the focus on sustainable growth for now, “Our unit economics have been improving dramatically since the start of 2019. Profitability is a key target in our strategy—it’s just not an immediate one.”\n\nNana: “Scale is the name of the game,” the founder of Nana adds. “Startups will need to learn how to be efficient with their capital, and benefit from government programs to be able to set up in multiple jurisdictions to become interesting for investment rounds at later stages. Hiring talent remains a key issue, especially in the UAE. \n\n\nMost information is from this report: https://magnitt.com/news/51728/magnitt-intelligence-q1-2020-increase-funding-deals-took-hit-march\n\n7\n\nSUCCESS STORIES IN IRAQ\n8\nMiswag\nSandoog\n10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nLocal success stories:\nOver the past few years we have been seeing more and more businesses tackle these challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that are here. There are several startups who have been embraced by the market and are growing rapidly. Some have even received investment. To name just a few successful stories, we can look at Sandoog, Lezzo, and Miswag.\nBriefly discuss these success stories:\nAsk: Do you know these companies? What do they do? How are they perceived in the market? What makes them so successful?\nSandoog is a last mile delivery company. Their business has started from Baghdad and now they are slowly expanding. Although Sandoog is a tech company, the founder (Mustafa) has pointed out how important it is to get the operations of your business running smoothly before you begin to expand (he said this in a CEO talk to our Tech-Incubator participants). There are so many details that you need to control operationally and on the ground. \nLezzoo is a food delivery company. Since they have started they have taken over the market. They were able to look at the gap in the market and do things differently to meet the needs of their customers. The user experience is really easy and intuitive which makes their product great. Since their launch, they have added several new features to better meet customers needs. These features were added slowly and strategically as to not overwhelm their customers or their own operational capabilities. They have been able to expand very quickly to operate in Erbil, Duhok, and Sulaimani.\nMiswag is the first e-commerce service in Iraq. Miswag was developed from scratch by Iraqi entrepreneurs and experts to best fit the young market's requirements. This is another example of a business that started quite small and has been able to expand over time. They are operating their delivery service to all major Iraqi cities. (I got this from their Linked-in page). \n8\n\nKEY ACTORS\n9\nEntrepreneurship\nTech\nDonors & Sponsors\n10 minutes: Discussion \n\nGo over some of the key actors in the region and talk about the role they play in the MENA context and how they help entrepreneurs. \nAsk: How are these businesses helping entrepreneurs navigate the challenges and opportunities we discussed earlier?\nAllow entrepreneurs to discuss the ones they know about. \nBuild off of the conversation by sharing what they do, how they can help entrepreneurs, and how they can get into contact with them (social media, their website, maybe they had someone visit as a judge or CEO talk, etc…)\nYou don’t have to do this for each of them, but pick some of the most important ones and share. \nExplain the link between the organizations focused on entrepreneurship vs tech and how they can work together. \nShare some ideas on ways to work with some of these current players.\nThis can be a brainstorm activity on a Jamboard or the whiteboard.\n9\n\nSPEAKING TO INVESTORS\n5-10 minutes: Discussion\n\nAsk: Has anyone ever spoken to an investor before? Has anyone been granted funding from another organization? What does the process look like? What are things that you should know or prepare ahead of time? \nLet entrepreneurs share their thoughts on this point.\nThey might come up with something like this:\nApply or reach out to someone who is providing funding\nGive some initial information (maybe it is an executive summary, they saw you pitch, a short meeting, etc…)\nIf they are interested, you might have a second meeting or call to give more information. Details of the business, where the business is going, strategy, competitive advantages, etc…\nInvestors will also assess how efficiently your business operates and how well it manages risk.\nInvestors often prioritize businesses that show clear long-term viability.\nMore formal due diligence process (this can take a while to go back and forth to answer questions and provide details and documents)\nAgreement and signing of a contract or term sheet\nImplementation of plan\nFollow up (there could be several follow ups throughout your agreement to make sure you are reaching your milestones and making progress) \nClose. It could be a short term agreement (granting organizations, banks giving out loans, etc…) or it can be longer term (an investor who is looking 10-20 years down the line). Either way, there should be some conclusion or exit for the investor/grantor. \n\nTransition: In the next slides, we will talk about how to understand investors and what they want, go through a due diligence process, and then actually spend some time preparing some key metrics investors might want to see. \n10\n\nSales \nPromotion\nWHAT DO THEY WANT?\nOR\n5 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nRemember, these people/organizations all have a motive. Nobody is just giving out money because they feel like it. Therefore, when speaking to these people/organizations, make sure you think about why they are giving money out. In order to make a good deal (or get accepted for the grant/loan), make sure that you know what the other person wants! If you know what they want, you can negotiate better with them. Make sure that you know what the other person wants. To get them to accept your business, you should communicate in a way that is tailored to their needs. Don’t lie, just know the right points to highlight. \nGet a discussion going on how to tailor your communication with funders to increase the likelihood of them funding your business.\nAsk: To get them to accept you, what should you consider? \nHow much money are they able to give?\nHow much involvement to they want?\nDay to day involvement\nMonthly updates\nBroader decision making abilities\nSilent relationship\nEtc…\nWhat do they value?\nFinancial returns\nCreating jobs\nSupporting vulnerable people\nThe environment?\nLooking “good” (people who do things just for their ego)\n\nBeing clear on what they want/need will help you make a better decision on if you should even work with them or not. Don’t just take anyone's money! Consider the ramifications of your relationship. \nAsk: Before you accept them, what should you consider? \nWhat are they bringing to the table?\nA strong network\nIndustry knowledge\nBusiness experience\nConnections\nLegal support\nEtc…\nWhat do they want from you?\nHow would they like their returns?\nIs there a payback period? What does that look like and how realistic is it?\nAre you required to do certain things? Are you able/willing to do this?\nHiring requirements, for example\nHow often would they like to communicate? What kind of updates do they require? Are you able/willing to do this?\nIs this something you really want/need?\nDoes this person/organization align with your values?\nDo they fit in with your company culture?\nAre there other options available?\n\nTransition: First, you have to know what they want so that you can be prepared to give them what they want in the due diligence process.\n\n\n\n11\n\nDUE DILIGENCE\u000b\n5-10 minutes: Lecture + discussion\n\nAsk: Has anyone heard of due diligence before? What does it consist of? Why is it an important step? Who is involved?\nDue diligence is all the research that goes into making a deal. Before any partnership, you need to make sure that you are a good match, you have common end goals, and that both groups are able to contribute useful and forwarding support. \nInvestor DD: Investors (or grantors) want to make sure they are making a wise investment. They need to see that you are the right person to give money to (compared to other startups)\nAsk: What do you think investors (or granting organizations) would like to see from you and your business? Remember they want to protect themselves from risky decisions while also achieving some goal (financial returns or some type of social impact for example) \nPotential answers:\nFinancial history to show that you have made traction and prove that people are actually interested in buying your product/service\nFuture projections to show where you plan to be in the coming years. How you will use the investment. How is the money tied into your growth and sales objectives? What is your action plan to actually get there? \nOperational efficiency – Investors look at how well you manage costs, optimize resources, and ensure smooth processes.\nRisk mitigation strategies – Investors want to see that you understand potential risks and have plans to address them.\nStrong competitive advantages to ensure that you are not easily copied (IP, exclusivity agreements, strategic partnerships, unique technology, etc…). This can help investors see long term and sustainable growth. \nA tested prototype, MVP, or final product/service\nProven business model\nBig market potential\nA strong team that will help you implement your plan and grow (remember that the one man show can be very scary for investors!)\n\nEntrepreneur DD: In addition to investors doing their research on you, you should also do your research on them as well. \nAsk: What would you want to research about a potential investor before making a deal? What are things you could ask them for? \nPotential answers:\nFrequency of meetings and updates that they expect from you\nLevel of involvement for the day to day business activities. If no involvement there, what about the bigger strategic decisions? \nOther businesses they have invested in\nWork history, expertise, industry knowledge\nValues and mission\nWhat is their risk tolerance?\nWhat else can they offer you other than money?\nMentorship\nAdvisory\nNetwork\nLegal support\nEtc… \n\n12\n\nSales Promotion\nReturn on Investment (ROI)\nJobs Created\nSales Secured\nCustomer Acquisition Cost (CAC)\nNet Profit Margin\nRetention/churn Rates\nMeasurable Impact\nBE PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT\n1 hour and 15 minutes: Discussion + activity\n\nAs you continue to build your network, attend events, and grow your business, you might meet someone who is interested in supporting your business (through investment or otherwise). If that happens, you need to be prepared to impress them from the very start. \nAsk: What are the things that you should be able to talk about right off the bat when meeting a potential investor or grantor? \nWrite all of the ideas on the whiteboard and discuss ways to capture and record them. Highlight the WHY behind these points. Why do investors want to see these numbers and in what situations you might want to use these figures.\nPotential answers:\nGo to market strategy\nValue proposition\nTraction\nSales secured\nMeasurable impact\nEtc… \nMake sure to include how to calculate some/all of the points below as well (if you are uncomfortable explaining exactly how to calculate a particular point, remove it from the slide): \nReturn on Investment (ROI): ROI=(net profit/cost of investment)x100. \nMake sure that you know how an investment would impact the business financially. What returns are expected from this money? This is used to compare different investment opportunities. Investors usually look for high returns on their investments.  \nCustomer Acquisition Cost (CAC): CAC=Marketing expenses/# of customers acquired. \nCAC measures the cost of acquiring a new customer. The easiest way to calculate CAC is to pick a specific time period and then divide your cost of marketing and sales by the number of customers you gained. For example, if you spent $1,000 to get 20 customers, your CAC is $50. CAC=Marketing expenses/# of customers acquired.\nChurn Rate: Churn rate = (users at the beginning of a period-users at the end of a period)/users at the beginning of a period.\nAlso known as churn rate, retention rate evaluates the percentage of customers that stay with you and the percentage that leave over a given time period. (That's why it's particularly relevant for subscription business models.)\nFor example, if you started the month with 10 customers, gained five new ones, and lost two, the calculation is 13 (total customers at the end of the month) minus five (new customers) equals eight, divided by 10 equals .8, or 80 percent. That means your retention rate is 80 percent -- you kept 80 percent of your customers.\nOr, if you prefer, you can calculate churn rate in very simple terms: If you have 100 customers at the start of the month and at the end of the month have 97, that means your churn rate is three percent.\nNet Profit Margin: Net Income/Revenue=Net Profit\nThis shows how much the company made in OVERALL profit for every $1 it generates in sales.  It’s calculated as: Net Income/Revenue=Net Profit\nIf a store earned $9,750 in net profit on $50,000 revenue so the net profit margin is %19.5\n\n1 hour: Activity\n50 minutes: Activity\nWork individually to start calculating some of these key metrics.\nGo to the last tab of the financial modeling template. Entrepreneurs can work on the “interesting metrics” section.\nWhat story are you telling around these points? \nA trainer will be around to help answer questions or clarify calculations.\nEntrepreneurs should feel free to support each other as well and work where they are comfortable.\nMake sure to note that they do not need to calculate all of the financial ratios shown. They are there just as an additional resource for them if they are interested. \n\n10 minutes: Share\nCome back into the room and share any new ideas or insights you have. \nWere there any challenges? Talk through any difficulties the entrepreneurs faced\n\n13\n\nBUILD YOUR BUSINESS\nKeep working on your business plan. Make sure to include the points we discussed about due diligence.\n\nPractice your pitch! – Send Google Slides no later than 5:00 pm on Thursday!\n\n5 minutes: Wrap up!\n14\n\nTHANK YOU!\u000b\nANY QUESTIONS?\n]]]",

Consistency & Alignment with the Incubator:**  \n- The curriculum provides a structured approach, starting with user research and gradually expanding to market validation.  \n- The transition from early ideation (user research) to feasibility analysis and competitive positioning seems logical.  \n- However, there may be room to better integrate sustainability and \"green\" entrepreneurship principles throughout.\n\n**2. Areas for Smoother Flow:**  \n- The structure appears robust but could benefit from **clearer linkages** between modules. For example, market research (macro and micro trends) could be introduced earlier to inform user research better.  \n- **More real-world case studies** could bridge the gap between conceptual learning and application.  \n- Emphasizing **feedback loops** in user research (how findings refine product development) could improve coherence.\n\n**3. Enhancing the \"Greening\" of the Curriculum:**  \n- Currently, sustainability is not strongly embedded. A possible solution:  \n  - Introduce **eco-conscious personas** in user research.  \n  - Incorporate **sustainability trends** into market analysis (e.g., tracking consumer preference shifts).  \n  - Include **green innovation frameworks** in prototyping and testing.  \n  - Add a **\"circular economy\" lens** in business model development.\n\nWould you like me to **suggest specific edits** for stronger alignment with your greening goals?",

Although it's still ok to say some - just keep it more integrated and referenced as options that have additional benefits ",

      "content": "To integrate sustainability principles while keeping the curriculum focused on general business strategy, I’ve adjusted the updates to make them more practical, business-oriented, and aligned with market trends rather than purely sustainability-driven. Here's how we can refine each module update:\n\n---\n\n## **1. Introduce Eco-Conscious Personas in User Research**  \n**Module:** 2. User Research  \n**Slide:** 4 (Persona Development)  \n\n### **Slide Update (bullet points):**  \n- Clearly outline your persona’s demographics, interests, pain points, and behaviors.  \n- **New:** Consider diverse customer preferences, including **cost-conscious buyers, tech enthusiasts, and customers who prioritize efficiency, durability, or sustainability.**  \n\n### **Facilitator Notes:**  \n> “Consumer behavior is shifting, and businesses that anticipate emerging customer trends can gain a competitive edge. For example, some customers prioritize price, others want convenience, and a growing number actively seek sustainability in their purchasing decisions. **By including a persona that values resource efficiency or environmental impact, you may uncover new market opportunities or partnerships that could differentiate your business.** It’s not about making a ‘green’ business—it’s about considering how your model resonates with evolving customer values.”  \n\n---\n\n## **2. Incorporate Sustainability Trends into Market Analysis**  \n**Module:** 4. Market Research (Macro)  \n**Slide:** 6 (Identifying Trends & Opportunities)  \n\n### **Slide Update (bullet points):**  \n- Identify current macro trends shaping your market.  \n- **New:** Explore shifts in consumer preferences, emerging regulations, and efficiency-driven innovations (e.g., automation, digital transformation, sustainability).  \n\n### **Facilitator Notes:**  \n> “Markets are constantly evolving, and one of the key drivers of change is shifting consumer demand. We’ve seen trends like the rise of online shopping, the digital economy, and **an increasing preference for cost-effective and efficiency-driven products. Many funders are also prioritizing businesses that align with sustainability goals—so considering ways to reduce waste, improve resource use, or make your business more energy-efficient could create funding or investment opportunities.** You don’t have to be a ‘green’ business, but if efficiency and cost savings overlap with sustainability, it can be an added advantage.”  \n\n---\n\n## **3. Include Green Innovation Frameworks in Prototyping and Testing**  \n**Module:** 5. Prototyping  \n**Slide:** 3 (Introduction to Prototyping Methods)  \n\n### **Slide Update (bullet points):**  \n- Overview of prototyping methods: low-fidelity vs. high-fidelity prototypes.  \n- **New:** Consider efficiency, cost savings, and durability in prototyping. **Bonus: Some materials and methods also improve long-term resource efficiency and reduce costs.**  \n\n### **Facilitator Notes:**  \n> “Good prototyping isn’t just about building a quick version of your product—it’s about testing for cost-effectiveness, usability, and market fit. **Choosing the right materials and production methods can reduce costs and improve long-term efficiency.** For example, digital prototyping can save money over physical models, and certain durable materials can prevent redesign costs later. If sustainability also aligns with business goals (such as reducing waste or using local resources), it’s an added benefit, but the priority is to create something viable and cost-effective.”  \n\n---\n\n## **4. Add a \"Circular Economy\" Lens in Business Model Development**  \n**Module:** 7. Competitive Positioning and Differentiation  \n**Slide:** 5 (Your Competitive Edge)  \n\n### **Slide Update (bullet points):**  \n- Clearly state your competitive advantage.  \n- **New:** Consider efficiency-driven business models (e.g., service-based, cost-saving innovations, and models that leverage reuse, repair, or shared resources).  \n\n### **Facilitator Notes:**  \n> “Businesses that focus on smart resource management often see cost savings, customer loyalty, and operational efficiency. **The circular economy is one example—it’s not just about sustainability, but about creating long-term value, reducing unnecessary expenses, and maximizing the use of materials or products.** This could mean offering repair services, repurposing excess inventory, or optimizing production to minimize waste. While sustainability is one aspect, the real win is improved efficiency, customer retention, and potential cost savings.”  \n\n---\n\n### **General Summary of the Approach:**  \n✅ **Keep sustainability as an optional lens, not a requirement.**  \n✅ **Emphasize business benefits first (cost savings, efficiency, investment opportunities).**  \n✅ **Show how sustainability overlaps with profitability rather than presenting it as a standalone goal.**  \n✅ **Frame sustainability as a way to differentiate in a competitive market, not as the primary reason for business success.**  \n\nThis revised approach ensures the program remains **business-focused and pragmatic**, while still making space for sustainability where it **naturally aligns with business growth, efficiency, and funding opportunities**.
