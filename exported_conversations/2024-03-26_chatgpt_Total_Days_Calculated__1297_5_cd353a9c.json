Since the total number of days in a year is either 365 (common year) or 366 (leap year), you need to know which years are leap years. In your example, the year 2000 is a leap year (as it is divisible by 4 and also by 400), but the rest (2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004) are common years.\n\nThe formula to calculate the number of days for each year is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Days} = \\text{Total Days in Year} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Percentage}}{100} \\right) \\]\n\nThen you sum up the days for each year to get the aggregate number of days.\n\nLet's calculate it for the years you provided:\n\n- 2000: Leap year, 366 days\n- 2001: Common year, 365 days\n- 2002: Common year, 365 days\n- 2003: Common year, 365 days\n- 2004: Leap year, 366 days\n\nNow, apply the percentages:\n\n- 2000: \\( 366 \\times \\frac{80}{100} \\)\n- 2001: \\( 365 \\times \\frac{80}{100} \\)\n- 2002: \\( 365 \\times \\frac{50}{100} \\)\n- 2003: \\( 365 \\times \\frac{50}{100} \\)\n- 2004: \\( 366 \\times \\frac{95}{100} \\)\n\nI'll calculate this now.",

Convert each percentage to a fraction (since 80% = 0.80, 60% = 0.60, etc.).\n2. Multiply each fractional percentage by the number of days in a year (365) to get the total days for each year.\n3. Sum all these values to get the aggregate total days for all 21 years.\n\nHere's the expanded code:",
