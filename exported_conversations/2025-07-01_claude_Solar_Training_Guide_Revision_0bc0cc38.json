  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user is developing a comprehensive solar training program for Iraqi trainers and requested Claude's help to restructure and consolidate their training materials. They provided extensive existing content including facilitation guides, slide presentations, and a proposed 5-day training schedule focused on transforming electrical engineers into solar entrepreneurs. The user emphasized they are Iraqi working with Iraqi trainers, so cultural sensitivity content was unnecessary. They specifically wanted to align the facilitation guide with speaker notes, create a better introduction, consolidate the overview guide, and focus initially on Day 1 before proceeding to Days 2-5.\n\nThe user requested HTML slide mockups to visualize layouts, particularly liking a homework slide concept they mentioned. They emphasized maximizing value, clarity, and usefulness while creating a \"Trainers of Trainers\" program. The training follows a 3-block daily rhythm of Learn-Apply-Sell with 70% hands-on practice, 20% business application, and 10% technical concepts. Key elements include Excel integration moments throughout the training, real story integration, component station rotations, and practical assessments rather than written tests.\n\nClaude provided a comprehensive strategic plan including a unified facilitator guide structure, consolidated introduction emphasizing practical application, detailed Day 1 facilitator guide sample with slide-by-slide speaker notes, and four HTML slide mockups covering homework assignments, Excel integration callouts, station rotation maps, and daily success metrics. The plan addressed the user's concerns about disconnected materials by creating unified speaker notes, integrating 17 specific Excel moments, embedding real stories into relevant slides, and maintaining clear day-by-day skill progression. Claude proposed a three-week implementation timeline and offered to complete additional components like the full Day 1 guide, more HTML templates, or Excel workbook integration guides based on the user's priorities.",

This is a 6-day, 70 % hands-on solar training. We start right now by meeting each other.”\n\nIce Breakers - What brings you here?\nFacilitator notes:\nFacilitator:\u000b “Alright, everyone—let’s learn each other’s names and why we’re here today. We’re doing a sticky-note mingle.”\nStep 1: Write (30 s)\u000b “I’m going to pass out one coloured sticky-note and a pen to each of you. On your sticky, write one single word that best answers ‘Why I joined this solar training.’\nIt could be ‘energy’, ‘income’, ‘safety’, ‘future’, anything!\nKeep it short—just one word.”\n(Trainer walks around handing out sticky-notes and pens.)\n“Ready? Go—30 seconds!”\n(After ~30 s, trainer raises hand.)\u000b “Time!”\nStep 2: Mingle & Introduce (1 min 30 s)\u000b “Now, stand up, and find someone you don’t know. Swap sticky-notes: read their word and introduce your partner to your table in a quick 10-second popcorn burst.”\nPopcorn rule: when you’re ready, just call out someone’s name and toss them the “popcorn” to speak.\nExample pop: “Pop! John, tell us your word and why.”\n“Go! Mingle for 90 seconds.”\n(Trainer circulates, encourages quick popcorn calls at tables: “Pop! Aisha?” “Pop! Mahmoud?”)\nStep 3: Share & Sit (30 s)\u000b (After ~1 min 30 s, trainer claps hands.)\u000b “Awesome—have a seat! Let’s do quick popcorn on one word per table.”\nTrainer points to Table 1: “Pop! Table 1, who’s first?”\nA participant shares: “My word is………..”\nTrainer thanks them, then moves on: “Pop! Table 2?”\n“Great—now we know names and why we’re here. Let’s move on to our financial check-in.”\n\nGenerator Frustration → Solar Solution\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n✅ صباح الخير everyone! Before we start, let me ask - who here pays more than 150,000 IQD monthly for generator fuel? [Count hands]\n\nNow, who wants to cut that by 80%? That's why we're here!\n\n30-second introductions:\nName + neighborhood\nCurrent job/business  \nGenerator horror story\n\nENERGY: Maximum enthusiasm!\nTIME: 15 minutes\n\nFinancial Literacy Pre-Quiz\nScan QR here\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nhttps://shorturl.at/GeLdB\nFacilitator notes:\n“Welcome!\u000b “Before we dive into solar design, let’s see where everyone stands on core business and money skills. This is our Pre-Training Financial-Literacy Assessment, and it’s diagnostic only—no grades, no pressure.”\u000b\nExplain purpose (30 s):\u000b “The questions cover payback calculations, cost comparisons, cash-flow timing, and basic profit metrics. Your honest answers help me tailor the week to your needs.”\u000b\nHow to complete (30 s):\u000b “Please open your phone’s camera or scanning app and point it at the big QR code. If you can’t scan, type the URL shown below into your browser. Once the form loads, tap the Pre-Test box at the top.”\u000b\nTiming & support (20 s):\u000b “You have 15 minutes to finish. I’ll walk around to help with any tech issues or provide a paper copy if your internet is unstable.”\u000b\nEncouragement & confidentiality (20 s):\u000b “Remember, this is just for you and for me to understand where we start. No one sees your individual scores—only aggregate results guide our sessions. Ready? Let’s begin.”\n\nDaily Agenda (3-Block Rhythm)\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nWhatsapp QR\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nBefore we dive into today’s content, I want to show you the heartbeat of our entire training: the 3-Block Rhythm.\n📘 LEARN (First Block)\nWhat it is: A focused theory segment where we introduce concepts, review real data, and demo key techniques.\nWhy it matters: This gives you the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind every tool and calculation you’ll use.\nHow long: Roughly 45–60 minutes each morning.\n“In this block, feel free to ask questions—that’s exactly what it’s for.”\u000b\n🛠️ APPLY (Second Block)\nWhat it is: Hands-on practice. You’ll work in small teams at stations or on rigs, putting theory into action.\nWhy it matters: Muscle memory and real-world troubleshooting live here.\nHow long: 60–90 minutes, with a built-in rotation so you touch every station.\n“Here’s where mistakes are your best teachers—don’t be shy to try, fail fast, and ask for help.”\u000b\n💼 SELL (Third Block)\nWhat it is: A quick pitch, reflection, or mini-task where you frame what you’ve learned in a customer context: ROI pitches, service designs, troubleshooting reports.\nWhy it matters: Our end users—and many of your future clients—care about the numbers and the story.\nHow long: 30–45 minutes, wrapping up each day on a high-energy note.\n“This final block trains you to translate skills into value—and gives us a fun way to celebrate progress each day!”\u000b\nTransition Script:\u000b “Every day, we’ll follow this rhythm: Learn new theory, Apply it in the field, then Sell it back as a solution. By Day 6, you’ll own this cycle—and you’ll use it in your design-competition finale. Ready to see it in action? Let’s switch to all of each day block rhythm”\n\n\n[EXCEL CALLOUT]\n📊 EXCEL MOMENT #1:\nOpen Tab 1: Ahmed's Cafe\nEnter load data in cells B5-B12\nWatch monthly cost auto-calculate!\n\n5\n\nDay 1-5 and Day 6 The Design Competition\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nLearn\nApply\nSell\nDay 1\nIntro to PV fundamentals \nComponent stations tour\nPanel & inverter hands-on\nLoad-audit workshop\n1-min ROI pitch video\nDay 2\nDeep dive: fuses & BMS\nDatasheet scavenger hunt\nWire-bench & breaker test\nBattery temp-log\nWarranty red-flag exercise\nDay 3\nCable sizing & torque logic\nFrame & wind loads\n4-panel roof-rig build\nDust-loss demo\nCleaning service pricing\nDay 4\nPVsyst simulation basics\nGrowth & shade analysis\nRoof plan editing\nCash-flow builder\nExpansion & service pitch\nDay 5\nTroubleshoot common faults\nFinal design sprint\nFault-hunt on mini-rig\nROI & margin wrap-up\nFinal 5-min pitch\nOptional Day 6\nDesign competition preparation\nDesign competition build-out\nWinner announcements\nFacilitator notes:\n“This is your roadmap for the week. Each day you’ll learn core theory, apply it hands-on, then sell your solution back to the class. Notice how the rhythm repeats—by Day 6 you’ll have integrated everything into a final design competition.”\n\nDay 1 Learning Objectives\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nLearn\nIdentify & handle real PV components\nRead key datasheet specs (Voc, Isc, temp-coef)\nApply\nCalculate household load in amps → kWh\nApply safety lock-out & DC rules\nSell\nCompare cost: generator vs solar (ROI)\nReflect & improve with daily feedback wall\nFacilitator notes:\n“Here are the six objectives for Day 1. The first two are Learn: by mid-morning you’ll be able to identify every PV component on the table and interpret Voc, Isc, and temperature coefficients from a datasheet.\nThen in Apply, you’ll calculate a real family’s load in amps and kilowatt-hours—and practice our zero-injury lock-out pledge on actual panels.\nFinally, in Sell, you’ll use those numbers to compare generator vs solar ROI and record a quick 1-minute pitch.\nFeel free to refer back to these as we go—each objective aligns to our Learn-Apply-Sell rhythm.”\n\nSafety First\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nGoal: 0 accidents all week\n(Share Ali’s story) \n⚠️ Isolate circuit — lock-out tag & padlock\n⚠️ Verify zero volts (DC first) with multimeter\n⚠️ Wear gloves & safety glasses\n⚠️ When work in electricity combine another person with you.\n⚠️ Use isolated tools while working in electricity.\n⚠️ One person shouts \"CLEAR!\" before reconnect\n⚠️ Never touch a live DC string\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nOpening Hook (30 s):\n“Before we jump in, I want to remind everyone why safety is non-negotiable. Last month, our colleague Ali got an accident with electricity because [the detailed story to be confirmed].”\n[Show a brief photo if available]\nLesson from Ali’s Story (45 s):\n“Ali admitted later that he needs to pay attention to [the detailed mistake to be confirmed].”\n“We don’t want ‘it always works’—we want zero incidents.”\nStep-by-Step Safety Ritual (1 min):\nIsolate: “First, open the breaker and hang the lock-out tag and padlock. That tag must read your name and time.”\nTest for Zero Volts: “Always grab your multimeter, set it to DC volts, and verify zero at both panel junction and inverter input.”\nPPE On: “Gloves and safety glasses stay on from start to finish—no exceptions.”\nBuddy System: “Never work alone. Your partner watches your back, hands you tools, and calls out if they see anything unsafe.”\nInsulated Tools: “Only use insulated screwdrivers, pliers, and cutters. Ordinary tools can turn into conductors.”\n“CLEAR!” Confirmation: “Before reconnecting, one person must shout ‘CLEAR!’ and everyone else must acknowledge. Only then do you switch the breaker back on.”\nHands Off Live DC: “Under no circumstances touch a live DC conductor. If you find voltage present, repeat steps 1–3.”\u000b\nReinforce & Model (45 s):\n“Let’s demo right now. Volunteer with me: please come lock out this breaker.”\n[Walk through the lock-out/tag-out procedure slowly, narrating each step: writing tag, locking padlock, testing multimeter, buddy confirmation, shout ‘CLEAR!’]\n“See how deliberate we are? This ritual is your daily habit—every single morning, before any hands-on work.”\u000b\nTransition to Next Topic (15 s): “Okay, with zero-injury top of mind, we’re ready to explore why Iraq’s energy mix drives us to solar. Let’s move on to how generators, grid, and sunshine fit into our story.”\n\n\n[EXCEL CALLOUT]\n📊 EXCEL MOMENT #2:\nOpen Tab 2: Cost Comparison\nAdjust system size in C3\nSee 10-year savings graph update!\n\n\nGrid 8-12 h, 100-160 IQD/kWh  \nGenerator 380-450 IQD/kWh  \nSolar ≈150 IQD/kWh)\nIraq Energy Reality\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n“Before we talk components, let’s ground ourselves in why we’re here: energy in Iraq.”\nDiesel Generators (30 s)\n“Right now, most homes and shops run on diesel generators.”\n“They cost 380 to 450 IQD per kilowatt-hour—that’s money straight out of your pocket. And they fill our air with smoke we all breathe.”\nQuick check-in: “By show of hands, who here has heard their generator run for more than 12 hours in one day?” (Pause for a few raised hands.)\nNational Grid (20 s)\n“The grid is cheaper—100 to 160 IQD/kWh—but only delivers power 8–12 hours a day, and the voltage wobbles so lights flicker and devices burn out. Not exactly reliable.”\nSunshine Potential (20 s)\n“Contrast that with 3 000 hours of sun every year in Mosul—more than 8 hours of sun daily on average. The sun is free, constant, and our best untapped resource.”\nSolar Cost Comparison (20 s)\nSolar Adoption (≈ 25 s)\nPoint to “< 5%”\n“Today solar makes up less than 5 percent of our energy mix.”\n“Yet with 3 000 sun-hours per year, the sun is our most reliable and pollution-free source.”\n“Yet each year, more people in Mosul are installing solar panels—adoption is rising fast”\n“And when you calculate all costs—hardware, installation, and maintenance—solar can already compete with grid rates, especially if you factor in the value of clean air.”\nTransition to Next Slide (15 s)\n“Now that we see why solar makes sense here, let’s look at the three main ways to set up a system—off-grid, on-grid, and hybrid.”\nClick to reveal “Three Solar Set-ups” slide.\n\nThree Solar Set-Ups\nOff Grid System\nDay 1\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nFacilitator notes:\nIntroduction (10 s)\n“Now that we’ve seen why solar makes sense in Mosul, let’s tour the three main system types.”\u000b\nOff-Grid Systems (25 s)\nPoint to OFF-GRID photo.\n“Off-grid systems run completely independent of the grid—panels, charge controller, inverter, battery all stand alone.\nUse case: Remote villages or telecom towers.\nPro: True energy independence, no grid fees.\nCon: Batteries cost a lot and need replacement.”\u000b\nOn-Grid Systems (25 s)\nPoint to ON-GRID photo.\n“On-grid systems hook directly to the utility—no batteries.\nUse case: Stable grid areas (e.g., government compounds in Baghdad).\nPro: Lowest upfront cost, you export surplus to the grid.\nCon: If the grid goes down, your solar shuts off too (anti-islanding), so no backup power.”\u000b\nHybrid Systems (25 s)\nPoint to HYBRID photo.\n“Hybrid systems blend the two: you stay tied to the grid and have battery backup.\nPro: You use solar when it’s available, draw from batteries during outages, and still export excess.\nCon: More complex equipment and higher cost—but this is the sweet spot for most Mosul homes, where outages are common but grid connection exists.”\u000b\nTransition (5 s)\n“In this training we’ll focus on hybrid designs, since they give the best reliability and ROI in our context.”\n\nWall of Challenges • 49 °C \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\n1️⃣ Unveil the slide.\n\n2️⃣ Ask quick show-of-hands poll:\n   “Who here has measured rooftop heat over 45 °C?”  (Count.)\n   “Whose family paid > 15 k IQD per amp last month?” (Count.)\n\n3️⃣ Invite TWO learners (≤ 30 s each) to tell a short story:\n   • One about generator cost\n   • One about roof heat or dust\n\n4️⃣ React:\n   “These four pains are the market opportunity we’re tackling this week.”\n\n5️⃣ Segue:\n   “To solve them we first need to understand how light becomes electricity…”\n   → click Next (slide ‘Solar = Light → Electricity’).\n\nTiming: 3 minutes total.\n\n\n[CREATE NEW SLIDE AFTER THIS]\nTitle: Component Station Map\nContent:\nSTATION LAYOUT:\n\nStation 1: Panel Quality Check ⚡\n- Compare premium vs standard\n- Find manufacturer date\n- Test junction box seal\n\nStation 2: Inverter Examination 🔌  \n- Identify terminals\n- Check cooling design\n- Calculate string sizing\n\nStation 3: Battery Reality 🔋\n- Spot fake vs genuine\n- Check BMS presence\n- Calculate capacity\n\nStation 4: MC4 Mastery 🔧\n- Strip cable properly\n- Crimp correctly\n- Test connection\n\n⏱️ 20 minutes per station\n👥 4-5 people per group\n📋 Quality checklist at each\n\n\nSolar Energy = Light → Electricity\nPhoton hits → electron flows ⇢ DC current  \nFactory flashes 1 ms to verify panel power\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes (≈2 min):\nOrient to the diagram\u000b “Here’s our stylized solar cell. See the junction in the middle between the P-type layer (on the right) and the N-type layer (on the left)? That’s where the magic happens.”\u000b\nExplain the photoelectric effect\u000b “When a photon—one packet of light—strikes that PN-junction, it gives an electron enough energy to jump from the P-side into the N-side. That movement of electrons is a direct current (DC) we can harness.”\u000b\nLocal context tie-in\u000b “Because rooftops in Mosul can hit 49 °C, real panels lose up to 14 % of their power compared to lab conditions. So, in the factory they flash each panel for just 1 ms under a xenon lamp to confirm it really meets its rated output before it ever sees our heat.”\u000b\nPop-corn Q1\u000b “Who can point out where the P-layer sits? … Yes, the right side—exactly.”\u000b Follow-up: “Why does knowing that orientation matter when we connect many cells in series for high voltage?”\u000b (Take one quick answer, then affirm.)\u000b\nSegue to the demo\u000b “It might look a lot like an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor)—both respond to light. But an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) only controls current; a solar cell actually creates it.

In broad daylight it converts sunlight directly into DC electricity. Its job is to capture as much sun as possible.\n[Move pointer to inverter]\nHybrid inverter, 5 kW capacity. It takes that DC electricity from the panels and any battery, then turns it into AC for your home—or sends excess back to the grid. On Day 2 you’ll tear one open and spot the differences between a cheap knock-off and a premium unit.\n[Finally, indicate the battery]\nLi-ion battery, 5 kWh BYD pack. It stores surplus energy so you’ve got power when the sun sets or the grid fails. We’ll test its health, measure temperature limits, and learn why a proper BMS is non-negotiable.\nWrap-up: “Between them—the panel, inverter, and battery—they handle 90 % of system performance. Over the next five days you’ll not only install each component but also become fluent explaining their specs and selling their value to customers.”\nTransition: “With these in mind, let’s check how they must interconnect… On the next slide, you’ll see the Compatibility Mind-Map that ties them all together.”\n\nCompatibility Mind-Map\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes (≈1 minute):\n“Here’s our Compatibility Mind-Map—think of it as the rulebook for assembling a safe, reliable solar system.\n[Point at central blue node]\u000b At the center is ’System Integration’—everything ties back to making these parts work as one.\nYellow branches: Panel ↔ Inverter\nVoltage range: Your panel’s Voc and Vmp must sit within the inverter’s maximum DC input (e.g., 500 V max).\nPower matching: Don’t oversize panels so much that you waste energy in clipping—or undersize and starve your loads.\u000b\nGreen branches: Inverter ↔ Battery\nBattery voltage: The inverter expects a specific battery bus (e.g., 48 V). Mismatches here will prevent charging or even damage the inverter.\nC-rate & current limits: Ensure the battery can safely deliver and receive the inverter’s power without overheating or undue stress.\nPurple branches: System-Wide Rules\nCable sizing & fusing: Always apply the 1.25× safety factor, choose the right conductor, and install DC-rated fuses close to the battery.\nEnvironmental protection: Dust, heat, and moisture can degrade performance—select IP ratings, derate for temperature, and plan for regular cleaning.\n\nAhmed – Coffee-Shop Owner \nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nFact\nDetail\nCritical appliance \nItalian coffee machine – 1 800 W\nCurrent supply\n15 A diesel generator @ 12 000 IQD/A\nPain point\nPower cuts ruin coffee & sales\nGoal \nWants reliable solar but fears up-front cost\nDay 1\nFacilitator notes:\nHook (10s)\u000b “Now let me introduce you to someone just like your future customers: Ahmed runs a small street-side coffee shop here in Mosul.”\u000b\nWalk through the data (40s)\n“Fact: He uses a 1 800 W Italian espresso machine every day.”\n“Current Supply: He powers it with a 15 A diesel generator at 12 000 IQD per amp – that’s 180 000 IQD each month just to keep coffee flowing.”\n“Pain Points: When the grid cuts out or the generator fails, he loses sales. He pays sky-high fuel costs, and on his dusty, scorching rooftop, panel cleaning is a nightmare.”\n“Goal: He’s desperate for reliable solar—but the upfront cost makes him hesitate.”\u000b\nTeam activity (3 min)\u000b “In your table teams, write down one additional data point you’d need to design Ahmed’s system. Maybe it’s his shop’s daily hours of operation, roof dimensions, or peak customer load. You have three minutes—go!”\u000b\nClose & tie-in (10s)\u000b “Fantastic—thank you! We’ll pin your notes up here, and at 15:30, you’ll plug Ahmed’s numbers into your Baseline ROI worksheet to see if solar makes sense for him.”\n\n🕚 APPLY\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\nKey Definitions\nDay 1\nTerm\nDefinition\nFunction / Why It Matters\nVoc\nOpen-circuit voltage\nMaximum voltage a panel can produce; must stay below inverter input limits\nIsc\nShort-circuit current\nMaximum current when panel leads are shorted; guides fuse sizing and cable ampacity\nTemp-coef\nTemperature coefficient (e.g. –0.35 %/°C)\nRate at which panel power changes with cell temperature; critical for hot climates like Mosul to predict real output\nAzimuth\nEast-/West offset (° from true south)\nOrientation of array relative to south; affects seasonal yield\nTilt (β)\nAngle between panel surface and horizontal plane\nControls how directly sunlight strikes panel; optimized per latitude to maximize annual energy\nPeak-Sun-Hour\nEquivalent full-sun hours per day (kWh/m²/day)\nSimplifies irradiation into a single daily value; multiply by system kWp to estimate daily kWh production\nkWh ↔ Amp\nEnergy (kWh) = (Amps × Volts × Hours) ÷ 1000\nQuick conversion to size loads and calculate cost: if you know a device’s current draw, you can turn it into daily energy consumption\nFacilitator note: \n“Before we touch any hardware, let’s lock down seven key terms you’ll see on datasheets and in calculations today. Think of these as your solar-survival kit.”\nVoc (Open-circuit voltage):\u000b “This is the maximum voltage your panel can spit out when nothing’s hooked up. It’s critical because your inverter has a voltage ceiling—stay below it or you risk damage.”\nIsc (Short-circuit current):\u000b “This is the peak current if you directly short the panel leads. We never actually do that—except in testing—but it tells us how big of a fuse and cable we need to keep everything safe.”\nTemp-coef (Temperature coefficient):\u000b “Panels lose power as they heat up. A typical value is –0.35 % per °C, so on a 60 °C roof you might be 7 % down just from heat. In Mosul, that adds up fast—always factor it in.”\nAzimuth (East/West offset):\u000b “Azimuth tells us which way the panels face: 0° is true south, –90° is east, +90° is west. Even a 15° error can cost you a few percent of annual energy.”\nTilt (β):\u000b “That’s the angle from horizontal—think of it like tilting your panel to chase the sun. At our latitude we use around 30°, but small tweaks bump up winter versus summer yield.”\nPeak-Sun-Hour:\u000b “This compresses sun intensity into ‘hours of full sun per day.’ If Mosul averages 5 kWh/m²/day, one kWp of panels makes about 5 kWh each day.”\nkWh ↔ Amp conversion:\u000b “To turn a device’s current draw into energy: Amps × Volts × Hours ÷ 1000 = kWh. You’ll use this to fill in our workbook and calculate real-world costs.”\n“Write to your note—or even snap a photo—because you’ll refer to these definitions every time we read datasheets or run numbers.”\n\nDatasheet Quick-Read\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSpec\nValue\nWhy It Matters\nVoc\n____ V\nPanel < inverter max to be compatible with the inverter\nIsc\n____ A\nfuse + cable sizing\nTemp-coef\n____ % / °C\nChanges in efficiency based on heat\nDay 1\nFind and note:\nMaterials to print & prep (before class): one copy of each panel’s datasheet (Longi vs cheap), A4 size. (If this activity is not possible, we can remove it)\n\nFacilitator notes (≈ 3 min total):\n1. Setup reminder (30 s):\n“Okay everyone, please take the printed datasheet at your table—one for the premium Longi panel, one for the low-quality panel. You’ll need pens.”\n\n2. Explain the task (30 s):\n“On each sheet you’ll find a sea of numbers. Our goal in the field is to spot three key specs in under a minute. Today those are:\n  • Voc: the panel’s open-circuit voltage (think of it as the “pressure” it can build when nothing’s attached).\n  • Isc: the short-circuit current (the maximum “flow” if you directly connect the leads).\n  • Temp-coef: how much power changes with temperature (for example, –0.35 % per °C, so panels lose a bit of output when they get hot).”\n\n3. Analogy (30 s):\n“Imagine Voc is like the highest pressure in a water hose when the nozzle is closed. Isc is the flood of water if you remove the nozzle completely. Temp-coef is how much that water flow drops when the hose gets hot in the sun.”\n\n4. Countdown & roam (30 s + 1 min):\n“Ready? I’ll set a timer for 2 minutes—find Voc, Isc, and Temp-coef on both sheets, write them down in the margin. Go!”\n\n5. Wrap-up (30 s):\nAfter timer → “Stop! Great job. This quick-scan skill lets you compare two panels in seconds—crucial when you’re on someone’s roof and they’re waiting.”\n\nPreview Workbook Tab 1: Ahmed's Cafe Load & Baseline ROI\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\n\nComponent Stations — Setup\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 1\nComponent Stations - Pre-Setup Checklist\n📋 Trainer Preparation\nStation 1: Panel Comparison\nEquipment Needed:\n1 premium solar panel\n1 low-quality solar panel\nStation folder with:\n✅ Panel datasheets (premium vs cheap) - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Comparison checklist (EN + AR) - printed\nStation 2: Inverter Teardown\nEquipment Needed:\n1 genuine inverter\n1 refurbished inverter\nStation folder with:\n✅ Inverter datasheets (both units) - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Teardown checklist - printed\n✅ Safety glasses for each participant\nStation 3: Battery Health Check\nEquipment Needed:\nReal battery sample\nFake/refurbished battery sample\n1 clamp meter\nStation folder with:\n✅ Battery specification sheets - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Health check procedure (AR/EN) - printed\nStation 4: MC4 Crimp & Test\nEquipment Needed:\nMC4 crimp tools\nMC4 connector pairs\n1 multimeter (polarity test)\nSafety gloves\nStation folder with:\n✅ MC4 connector specifications - printed\n✅ Pass/Fail assessment sheet - printed\n✅ Crimp procedure checklist - printed\n✅ Polarity test instructions - printed\n⚠️ Trainer Note: Each station must have complete printed materials before participants arrive.

Time’s up!\u000b We’re going to close the loop between what we just did and our Compatibility Mind-Map theory.\nHere’s how it works: I’d like one volunteer from each team to come up and choose a single measurement you recorded at your station—maybe Voc = 38 V or I<sub>SC</sub> = 9.2 A. Write that number in the Your Number column on the board.\nAs soon as it’s up, I’ll circle it and point out which Mind-Map Rule it matches.

Solar panels work best when sunlight hits them directly. Optimal tilt depends on location and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is 32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best orientation.\nFacilitator notes:\u000b “Okay, team—let’s talk about tilt and azimuth.\n‘Tilt’ is just how much you tip your panel up from flat ground. If it’s too flat, you miss low-angle winter sun; too steep, you lose high summer sun. In Mosul we aim for 32 to 36 degrees—that balance gives us the most energy year-round.\n‘Azimuth’ means the compass direction the panel faces. 0 degrees is true south, which gets the highest sun all day. A few degrees east or west are okay, but aim as close to south as you can.\n\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other structures can block sunlight from reaching solar panels. Even partial shading significantly reduces power output, as the entire string performance drops to that of the shaded panel. To maximize energy production year-round, it's important to avoid shaded spots when installing solar panels.\nFacilitator notes:\u000b “Next up: shading. This is a solar killer.\nAny time a bit of your panel is shaded, the whole string of panels drops in power—like a traffic jam on your roof.\nSee that tree branch on the right? That tiny stripe of shade can cost you 20 to 30 percent of your daily energy.\n\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\nWhat is the peak load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average load? (in Amps)\nWhat is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\nWhat is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\nWhat is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\nHow many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries without other input sources?)\nIs there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\nWhat is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar installation.\nWhat is the direction of true south?\nWhat are the building’s operating hours?\nHow many days per week is the building operational?\nWhat type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\nAre there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\nAny additional information?\nFacilitator notes: \n\u000b “Here’s your Field Survey Checklist—twelve key questions you always ask on any new rooftop. Today, we’ll practice using it.\nActivity Instructions:\nI need you in your teams to choose one nearby roof—your house, or the building next door.\nTake five minutes to answer the first six questions on the left in jot-form on a sticky note:\nPeak and average amps, future growth, grid availability, system type, and battery autonomy.\nAlso note any shading obstacles you spot—trees, pipes, walls.\u000b\nGo!

Next to it, the ‘Dusty’ bar falls to roughly 85 percent—a tangible loss that erodes your ROI faster every month.”\u000b\nMaintenance Solution (30 s)\u000b “The good news?

Under-torque and the next big gust will loosen your rails, risking misalignment and damage.\nHands-on tip: When you hear that “click,” stop turning—over-torque can strip threads.

A drilled hole and raw bolt aren’t enough in concrete—dust, heat, and vibration degrade simple expansion anchors. Instead, follow these four steps:\nDrill a 12 mm hole and blow out any dust.\nInject epoxy-based chemical anchor, filling the hole.\nInsert the threaded rod and leave it to cure for 24 hours.\nTighten the nut to 25 Nm—this torque drives resin into every crevice.\u000b\nFinally: Extra Wind-Load Notes.\nApply sealant tape along the rail slots to protect against dust infiltration and corrosion.\nOn the windward edge, use edge clamps or anti-uplift brackets to boost your pull-out resistance by an additional 20 %.\nNow, look at these real-world failure examples:\nPhoto A: anchor cured in dusty hole—notice the crack around the mount where the bond failed.\nPhoto B: panels bowed outwards because no expansion gap let them press against each other under heat.\nPhoto C: rusty slot-clips—dust trapped moisture and ate through the aluminum.\u000b\nActivity prompt (30 s):\u000b “Before we move on, turn to your neighbor and name one step of the chemical anchor process you’ve never done before. Go!”\n[After 30 s pair-share]\n“Great—let’s carry these mounting best practices into Station 1 of our Apply block, where you’ll assemble and torque the rails on a mock roof section with proper gaps and anchors.”\n\nDC Connection Perfection\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nStep 1\nStrip Cable\n(8 mm insulation)\nStep 2\nInsert Pin\n(fully home)\n*Photo A: cleanly stripped PV cable\n*Photo B: pin inserted to shoulder\nStep 3\nCrimp\n(18 Nm torque)\nStep 4\nPull-Test\n(≥ 150 N retention)\n*Photo C: crimper on pin, listen for “click”\n*Photo D: pull-tester reading ≥ 150 N\nFacilitator notes:\n[After reviewing mounting, trainer transitions:]\u000b “Before you head to the MC4 crimp stations, let’s lock down the perfect DC-connection ritual—because a bad crimp is more than a loose wire, it’s a fire hazard. In fact, up to 80 percent of rooftop fires start right here at the connectors.\nStep 1: Strip Cable\nGoal: expose exactly 8 mm of bare conductor. Too little and your pin won’t seat; too much and strands get nicked.\nTip: use the dedicated PV cable stripper’s stop gauge. You should see every strand intact.\u000b\nStep 2: Insert Pin\nGoal: slide the MC4 pin fully onto the exposed conductor until it locks at the shoulder.\nCheck: the gold-plated shoulder should be flush with the insulation’s edge. No copper should peek out.\u000b\nStep 3: Crimp\nGoal: use your ratchet crimper set to 18 Nm.\nListen: the “click” tells you you’ve hit the target torque—stop immediately to avoid over-crimping.\u000b\nStep 4: Pull-Test\nGoal: verify a retention force of at least 150 Newtons (about 15 kgf).\nProcedure: clamp the connector in the pull-tester jaws and steadily pull until you see the reading. Anything under 150 N means re-crimp.\u000b\nMini Activity (1 min):\u000b “Turn to your neighbor and quiz them: ‘What’s the one audible cue you listen for during crimping?’\u000b Go!”\n[30 s pair-share]\n“Exactly—the ratchet click.

The kit is fastest on site; the welded frame can be stronger but costs more in labour.”\u000b\nTorque Spec (30 s)\u000b “Every M8 bolt must be tightened to 18 Nm—just like on your MC4 and rail-mount tasks. Under-torque risks loosening; over-torque can strip threads.”\u000b\nWind-Load Calculation (60 s)\u000b “Mosul’s design wind pressure is 1.5 kN/m², which translates to about 150 kgf per m² of panel area: \nF = Pressure × Area  \nF = 1 500 N/m² × 1 m² ≈ 1 500 N ≈ 150 kgf  \nThat’s why we limit rail spans to 1.5 m—to keep bending loads within safe limits—and why in Tab 3 of your workbook you’ll price extra brackets or gussets so your kit stays solid in a storm.”\u000b\nTransition to Apply (30 s)\u000b “Now let’s head to our framing station, where you’ll practice bolting the kit rails to a mock roof section, torque them to 18 Nm, and sketch where extra brackets go. Grab your torque wrench and Workbook Tab 3—let’s go!”\n\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nRooftop Hazards & PPE\n🪜 Ladder at 75°: “Set ladder at a 75° angle for stability.”\n\n🪢 Harness & Anchor: “Always wear a fall-arrest harness clipped to a certified anchor.”\n\n🥽🧤 Gloves & Goggles: “Insulated gloves and safety glasses on at all times.”\nFacilitator notes:\n“Okay team, before we climb any more roofs, let’s run through our rooftop safety essentials.”\n1. Ladder Angle (30 s)\u000b “First, the ladder. You see the 75° icon—why 75°? Too shallow and it slips out; too steep and it tips backward. To find 75°, stand with your toes at the ladder base, reach your arms straight out: your palms should just touch a rung. Practice that every time you set up.”\n2. Harness & Anchor (45 s)\u000b “Next, fall protection. Every one of you must wear a harness clipped to a certified anchor point. No exceptions. If you’re more than one step onto the roof, hook in before moving. The anchor must be rated for at least 5 kN—always inspect the hardware before use.”\n3. Insulated Gloves & Safety Glasses (30 s)\u000b “Finally, PPE. Even if you’re just tightening a bolt, insulated gloves protect you from unexpected live wires or sharp edges. Safety glasses shield your eyes from dust, flying debris, or cable snap-backs. Keep them on from the moment you step onto the roof.”\nQuick Check (15 s)\u000b “Popcorn style—shout out one rooftop hazard we haven’t covered yet!”\u000b (Wait for a response, e.g., hot surfaces, sun exposure.)\nTransition (10 s)\u000b “Great—keep these rules top of mind all day. Next up, we’ll move into our wind-load and torque block, where we’ll practice safe bolt-torquing on a mock frame.”\n\nFuse & Ground Rules\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFuse on positive DC as close to battery as possible\nUse DC-rated breakers for combiner if > 4 strings\nGrounding and lightning rod ≥ 2 m, copper-clad 16 mm Ø. Target ≤ 5 Ω earth resistance (demo showed 12 Ω acceptable only for class)\nTest resistance ≤ 5 Ω (goal)\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s cover two non-negotiables in every hybrid PV system: DC fusing and earthing.”\n1) Battery-Positive Fuse (45 s):\u000b “Always install the first fuse on the positive DC cable right at the battery’s terminal. Why? If a short happens anywhere in the wiring, that fuse blows instantly and protects every meter of cable, every combiner box, and your inverter. No fuse here means your cable could catch fire or your battery pack could go into thermal runaway.”\n2) DC-Rated Breakers at Combiners (30 s):\u000b “When you have more than four panel strings feeding a combiner, swap the standard fuse for a DC-rated miniature breaker. DC arcs don’t self-extinguish as fast as AC arcs—so you need a breaker designed for DC interruption. Always check the label: it should say ‘DC’ or ‘PV use.’”\n3) Ground Rod Specs (30 s):\u000b “For your earth electrode, drive at least 2 meters of 16 mm-diameter copper-clad steel into the ground, as shown here. Copper-clad offers corrosion resistance, so your rod stays conductive for years.”\n4) Earth Resistance Target (30 s):\u000b “After driving the rod, measure ground-to-rod resistance. In class we saw 12 Ω, which is fine for a demo. But on a real rooftop or field installation, we aim for ≤ 5 Ω. Why?

Pour the entire 0.5 kg pack around the rod.\u000b\nStep 3: Backfill & Hydrate\nRefill the hole with original soil, then pour in 2 L of clean water. The water activates the clay’s swelling and forms a low-resistance zone around the rod.\u000b\nStep 4: Measure & Verify\nAfter waiting 30 minutes for settling, clamp your earth tester and measure. If you’re still above 5 Ω, hydrate again or add a second sachet. We also re-hydrate every 3 – 6 months to maintain performance.\u000b\nMini Q&A (30 s):\u000b “Why do we use both clay and salts instead of just pouring water?”\u000b – Expected answer: “Clay holds moisture; salts improve conductivity.”\n“Exactly—that combo keeps the soil conductive, even in our hottest summers.\nTransition to Demo:\u000b “Next, we’ll drive our demonstration rod, pack a sachet, hydrate, and see how we drop from 12 Ω down to under 5 Ω live.

Check that no one is standing within the hammer’s arc.”\n2) Hammering the Rod (30 s):\u000b “Trainee, please drive that 1 m rod straight down until only about 10 cm protrudes. Keep it vertical—any tilt reduces contact area with the earth.”\n3) Connecting the Meter (30 s):\u000b “Now, clip one multimeter lead to the top of the rod clamp and the other to our reference stake. Set the meter to the ohms range.”\n4) Reading & Context (30 s):\u000b “We’re seeing 12 Ω. Remember, for a real rooftop you want ≤ 5 Ω—so you’d add water to the soil or drive a second rod nearby to lower the resistance.”\n5) Quick Q&A (15 s):\u000b “Why do you think soil moisture matters? … Exactly: water improves conductivity between the rod and surrounding earth.”\n6) Wrap-up & Transition (15 s):\u000b “Great work—now that you’ve seen how to measure earth resistance.”\n\nPreview → Workbook Tab 3 Mounting BOM & Cleaning ROI\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nFacilitator notes:\n“Next, you’ll see exactly how those torque specs and wind-load limits feed into our cost models.

This shows in numbers how much shaded hours cost in energy and helps you recommend simple fixes like pruning or panel repositioning.”\n\nSELL — Market, Cash-Flow & Pitch\n“Finally, in Sell, you’ll use our Workbook Tab 5 to build a ten-year cash-flow model—factoring in system cost, O&M, and any supplier financing. Once you see the cumulative savings curve rising, it’s time to craft a short pitch: propose a bundle (e.g. expansion kit plus performance monitoring), highlight trust factors (real warranty, local support), and close with a question: ‘Shall we schedule your upgrade today?’ This wraps up Day 4’s cycle from theory to practice to customer value.”\n\n🕘 LEARN\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 4\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) - PVWatts Calculator\n(https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/index.php)\nAssists with:\nIrradiation modeling\nHouse orientation analysis\nSolar energy output estimation\nFacilitator notes:\nPurpose of PVWatts (20 s)\n“PVWatts is a free, web-based tool that lets you estimate a solar array’s annual and monthly energy production in just a few clicks. It handles three key tasks for you:\nIrradiation modeling – it uses NASA satellite data to calculate average sun hours for your location.\nOrientation analysis – you can adjust tilt and azimuth and instantly see how those choices affect yield.\nOutput estimation – it converts panel wattage into expected kWh/day and kWh/year.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nTool Overview – Why PVWatts?\nDay 4\nFacilitator notes:\nIntro & Context (15 s): “On this slide you see screen captures from the NREL PVWatts Calculator. We’ll be using PVWatts today to quickly simulate system output before moving into more complex tools.”\nWalk-through the Interface (30 s): “Let’s look at the main sections:\nLocation input: enter Mosul, Iraq here to load local climate data.\nSystem info: set your DC system size (e.g. 3 kW), module type, and array type.\nAdjustments: panel tilt, azimuth, system losses (dirt, wiring).\nResults: scroll down to see the monthly production graph and annual kWh.”\nWhy PVWatts for Day 4 (20 s): “We choose PVWatts because it’s fast, reliable, and gives you a consistent baseline. Today you’ll:\nRun simulations for different panel tilts and sizes.\nCompare your clean-sheet estimates with the real-world data you collected yesterday.\nLearn how small changes—like rotating your array 10° east—can gain or lose hundreds of kWh per year.”\nTransition to Demo (15 s): “Next up, I’ll demo a live PVWatts run: we’ll input our Mosul coordinates, set a 4 kW array with a 30° tilt, and review the output curve. Then, you’ll pair up and simulate your own scenarios.”\nTrainer Tips\n“Encourage participants to note the “Effective Sun Hours” value—it’s the core driver of kWh.\nRemind them that PVWatts assumes “clean” modules; compare against yesterday’s dust-loss data in your lab.\nIf someone’s connection is slow, show them the desktop screenshot you projected.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nSystem Sizing & Design Assumptions\nDay 4\nAssumption\nValue\nBaseline system size\n1 kW ⇒ ~1 200 kWh / yr\nPanel tilt\n32–36 °\nAzimuth\n0 ° (true south)\nTemp coefficient\n–0.35 % / °C (≈10 % loss @ 50 °C)\nPerformance ratio target\n≥ 75 %\nIrradiation\n~ 5 kWh / m² / day\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s pause and lock in our ‘standard recipe’ before we design any system.”\nBaseline energy yield (10 s):\n“We assume 1 kW of panels will deliver roughly 1 200 kWh per year in Mosul. That’s our rule of thumb for initial sizing.”\u000b\nOptimal tilt & azimuth (15 s):\n“Tilting panels between 32 and 36 degrees and facing them due south (0 ° azimuth) captures the most sun over the year. Small deviations cost you a few percent of output.”\u000b\nTemperature coefficient (20 s):\n“Every degree above STC reduces power by 0.35 %. At 50 °C on a hot roof, you lose about 10 % of nameplate capacity—so pick panels with a good temp-coef or size up accordingly.”\u000b\nPerformance ratio target (15 s):\n“Our Performance Ratio (PR)—the real-world efficiency after losses—should be 75 % or higher. This accounts for wiring, inverter conversion, soiling, and temperature.”\u000b\nIrradiation (10 s):\n“Mosul averages around 5 kWh/m² per day of sun. Multiply that by your array’s kWp and PR to forecast daily kWh.”\n“With these numbers, you can jump into PVWatts, run your first ‘clean-sheet’ simulation, and then compare to our real-world data from Day 3’s roof-rig.

Cost-Plus vs Value-Based\u000b “Most sellers quote ‘cost plus 10 % profit.’ That traps you in a race to the bottom: cheap gear, tiny margins, endless price haggling.\u000b Instead, value-based pricing charges according to the customer’s financial gain—their reduced diesel bills, avoided downtime, and warranty peace of mind.”\n2. Why Solar Fits Value-Based\u000b “A hybrid system isn’t just hardware; it’s a money-machine. You save IQD X per month—that X is your true price anchor. When you lead with ROI, customers stop arguing over IQD 50 000 here or there.”\n3. Introducing the Trust Pyramid\u000b “But numbers alone aren’t enough. Trust is your ladder to premium price points.\u000b • Product Quality: Start by showing them real panels and inverters you’ve vetted—Level 1.\u000b • Reliability: Then highlight safety measures—DC fuses, proper torque specs, dust-proof frames—Level 2.\u000b • ROI Guarantee: Offer a simple promise: ‘Your system pays for itself in Y years or I’ll discount service fees.’ That moves you to Level 3.\u000b • Partnership: Finally, seal the deal by positioning yourself as their ongoing service partner—monitoring, maintenance, future add-ons—Level 4.”\n4. Bundle Anchor\u000b “When you propose your expansion or cleaning plans, bundle them under this pyramid:\u000b ‘You get German-grade panels we guarantee for 25 years, we install with DC-rated fuses and 18 Nm torque checks, we promise a 3-year payback, and we’ll handle all your maintenance for 12 months.’\u000b That’s a value-packed offer, not just ‘cost + X.’”\nTransition to Next\u000b “With pricing & trust frameworks in hand, let’s pick two premium services to bundle into your Day 4 expansion pitch.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nBundle Brainstorm: Pick 2 Premium Add-Ons\nDay 4\nOption\nWhy It Adds Value\nTilt-Angle Audit\nOptimizes yearly yield by 3–5 %\nTorque Recheck Visit\nEnsures safety & warranty compliance\nWhatsApp Performance Alerts\nReal-time fault detection & remote support\nSeasonal Dust Cleaning\nMaintains ≥ 95 % output & extends panel life\nBattery Health Scan\nEarly fault warning → fewer replacements\nGrid-Export Monitoring\nShows extra revenue via feed-in tariffs\nIn your team, choose any two that best fit Ahmed’s expansion plan.

For grid power at 500 IQD/kWh, 52.8 kWh costs 26 400 IQD. If you’re comparing to a diesel generator, remember it’s charged per amp-month (200 000 IQD/A-mo)—you can break that down to a daily or hourly rate as needed.\nPay-back estimate (15 s)\u000b To see how fast solar covers its own cost, divide total system cost by annual savings. E.g., a 2.4 M IQD system that saves 0.8 M IQD/year pays back in 3 years.\nTariff reminders (10 s)\u000b We always build in a 20 % safety buffer—to cover losses, extra loads or small calculation errors—and account for your battery’s ~90 % round-trip efficiency.

No extra fee—just bring your best game!”\n“Alright—let’s get those final pitches underway!”\n\nPortfolio Excellence: Before → After\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 5\n*Case Study B\n\nBefore: Installation with undersized wires and no fusing\nAfter: Rewired system showing 6 mm² DC cabling, labeled DC fuses at combiner, and latching connectors\nCaption: “From unsafe cabling → full DC-rated protection and correct wire sizing”\n*Case Study A\n\nBefore: Grainy photo of a dusty, mis-wired rooftop array\nAfter: Crisp shot of the same roof with neat panel alignment, correctly torqued bolts, clear cable runs, and clean modules\nCaption: “From unkempt and under-torqued → standardized torque, neat cables, 95 % peak output”\nFacilitator notes:\n“Let’s celebrate real examples of excellence—where the right design choices turned a so-so install into a client’s dream setup.”\nIntroduce the Slide (10 s):\u000b “Here are two snapshots from our recent projects: dusty, disorganized arrays turned into high-performance, professional systems.”\u000b\nWalk Through Case Study A (20 s):\u000b “On the left you see the ‘Before’—panels misaligned, dusty, loose bolts, and tangled cables cutting into performance. On the right, the ‘After’: every panel is clean and correctly pitched, all M8 bolts torqued to 18 Nm, cables neatly clipped and labeled. That simple rework boosted output by 10 % and dropped maintenance calls almost overnight.”\u000b\nWalk Through Case Study B (20 s):\u000b “In Case B, the install used undersized 4 mm² cable without any DC fuses—that’s a fire hazard and guaranteed voltage drop. We rewired it with 6 mm² conductors, installed DC-rated fuses at the combiner box, and used proper latching MC4 connectors. The result? Zero faults in six months and a happy customer who refers us repeatedly.”\u000b\nKey Takeaway (10 s):\u000b “These ‘Before → After’ stories prove that attention to torque, wiring standards, and protective devices not only keeps people safe but also makes you the go-to pro in Mosul’s booming solar market.”\n“Keep these examples in mind as you prepare your final presentations—your portfolio is your strongest sales tool.”\n\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nPortfolio Excellence\nDay 5\nTeam B\nTeam A\nTeam C\nTop 3 Final Pitches\nFacilitator notes:\nCelebrate Excellence:\u000b “Congratulations, everyone! You’ve reached the final lap of Day 5. Let’s revisit our Portfolio Excellence by spotlighting the Top 3 final pitches.”\nHighlight Winners:\u000b “Here are the teams whose pitches combined clear hooks, robust designs, and rock-solid ROI numbers. Notice how each told a compelling story and closed with confidence.”\nCertificates:\u000b “Now that you’ve completed the core training, please come up to collect your Certificate of Completion for Days 1–5—proof of your new solar-engineering skills.”\nOptional Day 6:\u000b “If you’re eager to push further, don’t forget to sign up for our Day 6 Design Competition. You’ll tackle a real-world site under the clock and compete for top prizes.”\nStay Connected:\u000b “Finally, we’re adding you to our Solar Alumni WhatsApp group—an active community where you can ask questions, share wins, and access job leads.”\nClose:\u000b “That wraps our Module 1 training.

Optimal tilt depends on\nlocation and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is\n32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best\norientation.\n\n76\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other\nstructures can block sunlight from reaching\nsolar panels. Even partial shading\nsignificantly reduces power output, as the\nentire string performance drops to that of\nthe shaded panel. To maximize energy\nproduction year-round, it's important to\navoid shaded spots when installing solar\npanels.\n\n77\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\n1. What is the peak load? (in Amps)\n2. What is the average load? (in Amps)\n3. What is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\n4. What is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\n5. What is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\n6. How many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries\nwithout other input sources?)\n7. Is there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\n8. What is the layout of the roof?

Optimal tilt depends on\nlocation and season. In Iraq, the ideal tilt is\n32–36°, with a 0° azimuth for best\norientation.\n\n76\nShading Hazards\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nShading: Trees, buildings, and other\nstructures can block sunlight from reaching\nsolar panels. Even partial shading\nsignificantly reduces power output, as the\nentire string performance drops to that of\nthe shaded panel. To maximize energy\nproduction year-round, it's important to\navoid shaded spots when installing solar\npanels.\n\n77\nField Survey Checklist & Activity\nTowards decent and affordable housing in Iraq\nDay 3\nField Survey Checklist: Use the following questions to guide your on-site PV system assessment:\n1. What is the peak load? (in Amps)\n2. What is the average load? (in Amps)\n3. What is the expected future load growth? (in Amps)\n4. What is the average national grid availability? (approximate hours/day)\n5. What is the system topology? (Single-phase or three-phase)\n6. How many autonomy hours are needed? (i.e., how long should the system run on batteries\nwithout other input sources?)\n7. Is there a backup generator onsite? If yes, what is its size? (in kVA)\n8. What is the layout of the roof? Include equipment, shading obstacles, or barriers affecting solar\ninstallation.\n9. What is the direction of true south?\n10. What are the building’s operating hours?\n11. How many days per week is the building operational?\n12. What type of building is it? (Residential, commercial, or industrial)\n13. Are there any shading risks? (e.g., trees or nearby buildings)\n14.

      "content": "Looking at all the provided materials, I need to:\n\n1. Review the existing structure and content\n2. Create a clear, consistent structure between the facilitation guide and speaker notes\n3. Make a better introduction and consolidated guide aligned with the presentation\n4. Focus on Day 1 first before moving to Days 2-5\n5. Remove cultural sensitivity content (they're Iraqi trainers for Iraqi students)\n6. Create HTML slides for key elements like homework\n7. Maximize value, clarity, and usefulness for Trainers of Trainers (ToT) in Iraq\n\nKey observations from the materials:\n- The existing facilitator guide is comprehensive but needs better alignment with the slides\n- The slides have good content but need Excel integration points and story integration\n- The 3-block rhythm (Learn-Apply-Sell) is strong and should be maintained\n- Real case studies and practical examples are essential\n- Assessment should be practical, not paper-based\n\nStrategy:\n1. Create a unified introduction that sets the tone and explains the methodology\n2. Consolidate the overview to be cleaner and more actionable\n3. Align Day 1 facilitator guide with the slides, ensuring every slide has clear speaker notes\n4. Add Excel integration points throughout\n5. Create HTML mockups for new slides needed\n6.

Maximize value, clarity, and usefulness for Trainers of Trainers (ToT) in Iraq\n\nKey observations from the materials:\n- The existing facilitator guide is comprehensive but needs better alignment with the slides\n- The slides have good content but need Excel integration points and story integration\n- The 3-block rhythm (Learn-Apply-Sell) is strong and should be maintained\n- Real case studies and practical examples are essential\n- Assessment should be practical, not paper-based\n\nStrategy:\n1. Create a unified introduction that sets the tone and explains the methodology\n2. Consolidate the overview to be cleaner and more actionable\n3. Align Day 1 facilitator guide with the slides, ensuring every slide has clear speaker notes\n4. Add Excel integration points throughout\n5. Create HTML mockups for new slides needed\n6.
