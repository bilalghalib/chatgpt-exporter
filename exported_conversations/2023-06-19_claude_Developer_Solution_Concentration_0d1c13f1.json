Since the ratio is 1:14, we need to divide that into 1 part developer and 14 parts water.\n* 500ml / 15 parts total = 33.33ml per part\n* 1 part is developer, so 33.33ml of developer\n* 14 parts are water, so 14 * 33.33ml = 466.67ml of water\n* So to make a 500ml solution with a 1:14 developer to water ratio:\n* Developer: 33.33ml \n* Water: 466.67ml\n* Total: 500ml\n\nSo in summary, to make 500ml of solution with a 1:14 developer:water ratio, you would add:\n* 33.33ml of developer\n* 466.67ml of water\n\nLet me know if this makes sense!
