The daily average temperature was 27 °C. At fan OFF condition, the highest temperature recorded at normal attic was 47.7 °C. At fan ON condition, the highest temperature recorded at attic with SPAVF was 39.3 °C. This proves the effectiveness of fan usage at attic, by reducing the highest temperature by 8.1 °C.\nFigure 2.4: The Recorded Temperature (Yu and Moore, 2015).\n\nhttp://eprints.utar.edu.my/5308/1/1606413_fyp_report_%2D_MUN_LING_HO.pdf\nSo cool: https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1651&context=fsec \n\nTools and Materials for Training Program\nItem\nCategory\nType\nMinimum Required\nRecommended\nPrice\nSolar Panels\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInverter\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCharge Controller\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nBattery (Lead-acid or Lithium)\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCable (DC/AC)\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nMC4 Connectors\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nRoof Mounting Kit\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nMultimeter\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nClamp Meter (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nSolar Installation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nDrill with Bits\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nWrench Set\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nScrewdrivers (Flat & Philips)\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nSafety Gloves\nTool\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInsulation Tape\nMaterial\nSolar Installation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nPolystyrene Panels\nMaterial\nInsulation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCool Roof Coating\nMaterial\nInsulation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nReflective Foil\nMaterial\nInsulation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nSealing Foam\nMaterial\nInsulation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nCaulking Gun\nTool\nInsulation\nYes\nYes\n\n\nInsulation Board Cutter\nTool\nInsulation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nThermal Camera (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nInsulation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nBlower Door Test Kit (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nInsulation\nNo\nYes\n\n\nExhaust Fan\nMaterial\nArchitecture\nYes\nYes\n\n\nFlexible Ducting\nMaterial\nArchitecture\nYes\nYes\n\n\nMesh Grills\nMaterial\nArchitecture\nYes\nYes\n\n\nTemperature/Humidity Logger (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nArchitecture\nNo\nYes\n\n\nAirflow Meter (optional for advanced diagnostics)\nTool\nArchitecture\nNo\nYes\n\n\nMeasuring Tape\nTool\nGeneral\nYes\nYes\n\n\nSpirit Level\nTool\nGeneral\nYes\nYes\n\n\nUtility Knife\nTool\nGeneral\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\n\nHands-on kits: confirm 4 complete mini-systems so each team of 4 gets time on the tools.\nthink deeply and help me design it well given the interview insights and the interviews and return with a thought out and refined and practical and simple training - materials list, learning objectives that we can use for junior architects to upskill and learn sustainable/green concepts and to connect it to the broader mission/project of the international trade centers role in creating green jobs and greener homes in mosul iraq ",

      "content": "The file contents provided above are truncated/partial snippets. The complete content for these files IS accessible via querying.\n\nIf the user asks a question related to these files, and the provided snippets do not clearly answer it, you **MUST** use the `file_search` tool to search the full document contents before responding.\n\n## How to invoke the file_search tool\nIf the user's query isn't sufficiently answered by the provided snippets, parsed text, or images, you should invoke `file_search.msearch`.\nTo search the full content of the available files, you **must** send one message with recipient `to=file_search.msearch` in the analysis channel. Your message should be structured exactly as follows:\n```\n{\n  'queries': ['Example query 1', 'Example query 2']  // List of up to five queries to search for.\n}\n```\n\nCarefully balance the number of `file_search` calls and the quality of your response with the latency incurred by `file_search` calls.\n\nImportant guidelines for query formatting:\n- Your message must be a valid JSON object. Do not include any extraneous text, backticks, markdown formatting, or comments beyond what is shown.\n- The `queries` field must be a list of strings.\n- One of the queries **MUST** exactly match the user's original question, but stripped of any extraneous details, and with ambiguous references clearly resolved using context from the conversation. It **MUST** be a complete sentence.\n- Even if you suspect the user meant something else, one query **MUST** still be their original question.\n\n## How to handle results from file_search\nThe file search tool will respond with the relevant search results from the full files. After you receive these results:\n- Carefully evaluate each result to determine its relevance and quality.\n- Use the high-quality and relevant results to inform your answer to the user's question.\n- When possible, reuse information from prior file_search results and avoid repeating identical queries.\n\n## Tool usage instructions and ordering\nWhen the user asks a question, carefully consider whether the provided snippets sufficiently answer the query, whether you need to invoke `file_search.msearch`, or another available tool (such as `web`, if available) should be used instead.\n\nTool-ordering Guidelines:\n1. For queries related to uploaded files, if snippets are insufficient, strongly prefer invoking `file_search.msearch` over other tools.\n    - Avoid using `web.run`, `python` analysis, or any other tools until you have either:\n        - Confirmed with high confidence the answer is not in the files, or\n        - Have high confidence `file_search_tool` queries are not sufficient to answer the query.\n2. Avoid usage of `web_search/web.run` for queries related to uploaded files\n    - Carefully consider whether the user's query is better answered by web search results rather than available snippets or results from `file_search_tool`.\n    - Unless the user's query is clearly unrelated to the uploaded files, prefer using `file_search.msearch`. You can always follow up with a web search if necessary for a more complete response.\n3. Avoid using `python` unless necessary or requested by user.\n    - If the user's query is answerable from the parsed text and images from the uploaded files, or from `file_search_tool`, do not invoke `python`.\n\nAlways keep this instruction in mind for the rest of the conversation, as the user may reference these files or ask related questions later on.",

For instance, in an Indian city, cooling products provided savings of up to 34.8%, with roof cooling loads falling from 73% to 90% after PV installation. citeturn0search3\n\n- **Urban Heat Island Mitigation**: Large-scale deployment of rooftop PV panels can influence local microclimates.
