welcome all of you on on the\n0:12\nworkshop on sustainable approaches to post disaster reconstruction um thank you very much especially for\n0:19\ncoming on a weekday some of you may be really busy of course and we really appreciate you coming to attend the\n0:26\nworkshop so I hope you have your breakfast ready um coffee ready\n0:31\num and you're ready to start the day with us so this event is jointly organized by adbi and my colleagues\n0:38\nprofessor piyush and also Dr chioti Shukla from the University of Melbourne so um we'll start the day at uh 10 AM\n0:47\nthis morning so I'm going to run through some of the some of the agenda and also the housekeeping rules so before we\n0:54\nstart I'm sure all of us are quite familiar with the arrangement of Zoom\n0:59\nbecause we're probably quite used to it but I just want to quickly go through the usual Arrangement here uh first of\n1:06\nall please turn on your video or put a profile picture on Zoom uh mute your mic\n1:12\nwhile other speaking also do not forget to turn on your video while you're speaking if you want to ask a question\n1:18\nyou can either type it in the chat box or click the raise your hand button uh\n1:24\nwe would also like to inform that the whole session will be recorded um\n1:30\nso um this is for our Intel now internal procedure as well so\n1:36\num now I will briefly explain the agenda we will start at 10 AM\n1:41\num with the welcoming remarks from Dr Dale rahu a vice chair of research and\n1:47\nSenior research fellow of adbi then we will go into the first session that will be led by Professor Pierce Diwali of the\n1:54\nUniversity of Melbourne to talk about the identification of post-disaster losses of affected person as our\n2:00\noverview of the old day session and then after that it goes to 1 pm then we will\n2:07\nhave a one hour break after that we will start with assassin 2 that will be led by Dr Jyoti Shukla to discuss the\n2:15\ncapability approach as a method for normative evaluation of inequality and\n2:20\nalso social justice development policies we will also discuss some case studies in the session for\n2:27\num now I guess I will go to Dr deal who will give the opening remarks so Dr DIA\n2:34\nLaura stairs thank you thank you thank you so much dookie for\n2:40\nyour kind introductions I'd like to welcome all of you to this conference on\n2:47\non sustainability approaches to post-disaster Rex management\n2:52\nbasically first I would like to start by thanking Professor Pius for making time\n2:58\nfor us you know like we are very honored to have such a distinguished\n3:03\nuh Professor with us to share your experience and share your your knowledge\n3:09\nuh with with with young researchers from developing countries so thank you very much uh Professor bios and I would also\n3:15\nlike to thank Dr Jyoti sukla for being with us thank you very much you bring in so much of experience and I think it\n3:22\nwill be a very interesting experience for all of us and also I would like to thank uh Dr sitaram for organizing this\n3:30\nvery interesting workshop and I shouldn't forget to thank dookie for for\n3:36\nputting everything together I I would also like to thank uh saksi sakshi we\n3:42\nshare with us and and so akiko-san for providing all the supports we are very\n3:48\ngrateful to you without your support and without your contributions we wouldn't have had this very interesting and\n3:54\ntimely conference so I would also like to give a very brief thoughts about\n4:00\nabout the the disasters like until now the way we look at\n4:07\ndisaster has been like you know like a fire fighting kind of events you know whenever there is a disaster we go\n4:12\naround and try to put up the fire however like you know uh the the disasters uh in has been increasing and\n4:20\nit has been very chaotic the frequency of disaster has increased the intensity of disaster has increased therefore it's\n4:27\nvery important for us to be prepared so that when disaster happens we are not in\n4:32\npanic we are able to handle it uh in it very well and and this this webinar will\n4:38\nbring about uh several he says and also uh theoretical\n4:44\nbackgrounds behind a disaster risk management uh particularly like uh in\n4:50\nthe in the face of climate change the the disasters biotic disaster is\n4:56\ngoing to be even more serious therefore therefore all of us need to be prepared uh before we actually face disaster for\n5:03\nexample we had a disaster in Pakistan the the flood the severe flood it you\n5:09\nknow as a result of which uh like there was loss of poverty there were there was lots of uh infrastructures but also loss\n5:17\nof life therefore like we really need to prepare ourselves so that before anything happens we are able to we we we\n5:24\nwe create a society which is very resilient to to the disaster that's one and second thing is that whenever\n5:31\ndisaster happened little negative effect that we have we are able to manage it well so so that's very very important\n5:38\nand and and and and and and these challenges is has been rising particularly we had been discussing with\n5:45\nProfessor Pious if you look at the coastal areas particularly like you know areas like sundarbans we can see lots of\n5:52\nuh disaster the the rise of sea levels salinations Gene Nations and and and\n5:57\nthis poor small uh you know households living along the coastal areas has not\n6:03\nbeen able to cope with those socks therefore we really need to build a resilience you know resilience at an\n6:10\nindividual level resilience at the at the at the societal level and Regional uh National level and also Global level\n6:17\nso that's one thing that we really need to need to look at and and this uh this\n6:23\ninteresting Workshop will bring out several cases and and discuss those\n6:29\ncases as to how different countries different communities manage those\n6:34\nshocks uh I wish like you know I could I could I could be be with uh with\n6:40\nProfessor Pious and and Dr Jyoti and the team for the entire day to to listen to\n6:45\nthis very interesting discussions that's going to take place unfortunately I have to travel so I have to take leap but but\n6:51\nthen like I would definitely like you know get back to uh to Professor Pious\n6:57\nand also Dr choti to to know more about it because this is this is very crucial\n7:02\nand this is very important for all of us because we have we we have not realized\n7:09\nthe the challenges that we are facing as a Humanity so so this this webinar will\n7:16\ndefinitely bring out those uh those uh those challenges that we are facing and and how do we actually manage those\n7:23\nchallenges so as to minimize the loss of life and loss of poverty poverty so so\n7:30\nwith this I would like to thank once again or the organizer and also I'd like\n7:36\nto thank Professor Pious and and Dr Jyoti sukla for for being with us and\n7:42\nand for taking time to share your valuable experiences valuable research\n7:48\nthat you have done and also I'd like to thank all the participants for being with us and I would like to request all\n7:54\nthe participants to to actively participate post questions and also like you know share your cases so that like\n8:01\nyou know like we also could learn from your experience with this and with with\n8:07\nthanking note I would like to and my opening remarks and give back the floor to the UK\n8:14\nthank you very much that the deal for the opening remarks um now uh we would like to just go\n8:20\nstraight to the session that will be led by Rosa piyush uh brother\n8:26\nthank you very much um the floor is just thank you very much Ricky thanks a lot\n8:33\nand thanks Dr Del Rio and Dr Sita Randi it has been wonderful to work with you\n8:40\nover the last year or so or maybe more than a year on this whole project of\n8:46\ndisaster post disaster reconstruction and we have been exchanging ideas and\n8:52\nthoughts about how the disaster is being viewed and how it is being addressed given that the frequency and intensity\n9:00\nas Dr Dell was mentioning of disasters has increased I would also like to thank adbi for\n9:07\nputting together this wonderful event where it has brought participants from\n9:12\n20 countries can you believe it 20 countries uh participants are\n9:18\nparticipating in today's that shows the importance of this issue and particularly in Asia which is one of the\n9:24\nmost disaster prone area in in the world uh Vicky and sakshi have been the\n9:30\nbackbone of this whole event and it has been great to work with them and receive\n9:35\ntheir support so what I'm going to do is that very briefly\n9:40\num let me share the slide first\n9:46\nvery briefly uh take you through the day's agenda and also introduce\n9:52\nmy colleague and me so my name is piyush tiwari I'm professor\n9:58\nand property at the University of Melbourne I've been working on the issue of\n10:04\ndisaster for a few years now mainly starting as the role that the\n10:10\nproperty can play in disaster reconstruction the question arose from the concerns\n10:19\nabout well-being welfare and inequities and how these are addressed within the\n10:25\ndisaster context and the well-being plays a very important role particularly when we are looking at post-disaster\n10:32\nreconstruction of those who are affected by disasters so we thought that it may be a great\n10:38\nidea to put together the knowledge that is already there on the experiences of\n10:45\npost-disaster reconstruction and what are the good approaches going forward so\n10:51\nthat is broadly where I am coming from uh from the perspective of my research\n10:56\nand in the past I have worked on infrastructure policy and infrastructure Finance in um in India and also have\n11:04\nbeen teaching uh property for more than 25 years now so that's very brief\n11:11\nintroduction but would be most uh welcome uh any kind of questions that you may\n11:18\nhave or anything else that you would want me to share I would be more than happy to share before I uh ask Dr Jyoti Shukla to\n11:26\nintroduce herself one request I have is that in today's Workshop\n11:34\nwe are co-creating the knowledge so all of you are participating are equally uh\n11:40\nresponsible for contribution so please feel free to share your thoughts your questions participate anytime you like\n11:48\nand let's co-create the knowledge of post-disaster reconstruction that's the\n11:54\nagenda that I would set for all of us today Dr Jyoti Shukla um would you like to introduce yourself\n12:02\nthank you push and uh thank you everyone else for participating and organizing this important session my name is Jyoti\n12:09\nand uh my association with the issue of disaster was through my doctoral\n12:15\nresearch where I started looking at the concept of well-being and what property\n12:22\ncontributes to the well-being of those who own it and when taken away\n12:29\nhow does it impact upon their well-being and all these were very uh theoretical\n12:35\nyet empirical studies and starting from looking at property we have slowly\n12:41\nexpanded to look at various ways in which property is lost and then how can it be restituted both\n12:48\nin terms of the physical laws the financial loss as well as those dimensions of well-being which property\n12:56\nbuilds together along with other assets and other uh infrastructure and resources in the\n13:03\nform of social networks and also in the form of familial networks that people have because property is not just one\n13:10\nphysical entity it is created together with the help of these uh software associations with people around it the\n13:18\nsense of identity Place territory Nation Etc so those Concepts when expanded uh\n13:26\nto look at broader definition of disasters be it man-made disaster or be\n13:32\nit natural disaster is what constitutes the core area of my research and today I\n13:37\nwill share insights from Theory as well as its application in the\n13:44\ncase of tsunami disaster in the Indian context and I look forward to those\n13:49\ndiscussions with with your participation of course as you rightly mentioned so\n13:55\nlooking forward to it over to you piyush thank you very much Jyoti\n14:04\nright so what we set ourselves are some of the learning objectives what are we going to get out of this whole day\n14:11\nworkshop uh first of all let's set our expectations at the outset very clear\n14:19\nour focus is on post-disaster reconstruction we are not looking at the\n14:26\ndisaster mitigation part which is also an important but in this Workshop we are not debating or discussing that part the\n14:34\nsecond thing is that our focus is more on the policy in the program the\n14:40\norganizational structure the institutions and the mechanisms that are used in post disaster reconstruction we\n14:47\nare not going to look into the engineering or technical aspect of how the post disaster construction should\n14:53\nhappen or what how the shelter should be constructed and so on but what we would\n14:59\nbe looking at is what is to be reconstructed that's the first question\n15:05\nis it the shelter is it the livelihood are these the important issue or is it\n15:12\nsomething else that we are trying to reconstruct before that the question that arises is\n15:19\nwhat is lost is it the loss of house is it the loss of income is it the loss of other assets\n15:26\nis it the loss of infrastructure or is it something that Prime so here what we\n15:33\nposition as a proposition is that while these resources these assets are\n15:40\nimportant but they all contribute to the broader goal of well-being and that is that is what is lost during uh during\n15:49\nany disaster now then the question is that if we were to reconstruct well-being what do we\n15:56\nmean by that how do we identify the components of well-being that are lost and how do we\n16:03\nreconstruct well-being so then in that reconstruction what are the challenges\n16:09\nthat we face so there are few learning outcomes that we set for ourselves the first is to\n16:14\nidentify normative and conceptual issues that arise during post disaster\n16:20\nreconstruction these are important issues\n16:25\num the post-disaster Reconstruction is\n16:31\nno matter each disaster is different each context is different\n16:38\nthe different approaches then that are used to reconstruct would also have\n16:45\nthese specific dimensions so need to understand or identify\n16:50\nwhat are those issues that arise during a post-disaster reconstruction\n16:55\nthe second learning outcome is to familiarize the emerging discourses on\n17:00\npost-disaster reconstruction so again emphasizing on the point that we are\n17:06\nstepping away from the technical or engineering discussion into the philosophical into the policy or the\n17:14\nprogram how do they take it to those uh philosophical uh issues that arise and\n17:20\nwhat challenges that poses so we need to understand what are those emerging discourses on post-disastery\n17:27\nconstruction the third learning outcome that we would have is to apply a theoretical approach\n17:33\nwhich is based on capability approach or the sense capability approach of looking\n17:39\nat welfare slightly differently to understand and measure the losses that need to be\n17:46\nreconstructed after disaster and also the link that we have between\n17:55\nthe current practices and the build back better framework\n18:00\nit also the whole Workshop or the whole discussion will also erase the question\n18:06\nthat we need to understand and discuss and answer for ourselves what do we mean\n18:11\nby build back better is it building a shelter is it building an infrastructure\n18:16\nor is it rebuilding the well-being of those who have been affected by disaster\n18:23\nnow if the if the spotlight is on well-being then we need to understand\n18:29\nhow do we understand well-being and what are those Dimensions that we need to reconstruct in a buildback better\n18:37\nparticularly from the point of view of um reinstituting well-being of a\n18:42\nhousehold or affected person the structure of the workshop is that\n18:50\nvery briefly I'll talk about based on the literature what are the key issues\n18:56\nthat have that have been discussed in the post-disaster\n19:01\nReconstruction what are the challenges associated with that and um what kind of issues arise there\n19:08\nthen we'll have a break uh for about 10 minutes where and we will stay back both\n19:15\nDr Shukla and I would be here if you would want to discuss any question that\n19:21\nmay arise from the previous session please do that then after that I'll uh in the session\n19:27\ntoo I'll take you through some of the select case studies from the asean countries\n19:32\nand we'll look at the key issues that were there and those disaster\n19:38\nreconstruction practices here we'll look at what has been reported researched and\n19:45\ndiscussed in the literature and also I will present some very brief insights\n19:51\nfrom the workers or the field field staff\n19:58\nwho were participating in those reconstruction efforts\n20:03\nthen we'll have a lunch break between one and two post that lunch break Dr Shukla will take you through the\n20:09\ncapability approach which is the overarching framework through which uh\n20:14\nwe would look at the well-being of disaster affected person\n20:19\nand then in session four uh Dr Shukla will um work with you in applying capability\n20:27\napproach to a context and see what kind of results and outcome does that lead to\n20:35\nso without further Ado let me start with the first session on the post disaster\n20:42\nreconstruction the approaches advantages and limitations now one request I have is that\n20:50\nplease don't hesitate to ask questions this is a great opportunity and all of us are here to learn from each other so\n20:58\nplease don't uh hesitate to ask questions you can unmute yourself ask\n21:03\nquestion or you can um you can write your question in the chat box\n21:08\nwe will take those questions as we go and it will be also great learning\n21:14\nexperience that way and will be participative process through which we'll try to\n21:21\num gain something out of it today so the first the structure of my talk in\n21:28\nthis session um is as follows the first issue that I would place\n21:35\nbefore you is the challenge that the Asia and the Pacific faces with regard to disaster\n21:42\nAsia and the Pacific is the most vulnerable um region of the war and it Witnesses\n21:49\nnumerous disasters which have significant negative impact on life's livelihoods\n21:57\nand the assets of household we'll also talk about some of the\n22:03\napproaches to disaster management the Frameworks that have evolved over a\n22:08\nperiod of time very briefly and see what are the key components of those framework\n22:15\nthen based on literature around numerous disasters without going into the details\n22:20\nof the disaster specifically what are the key lessons that have emerged in the\n22:27\npost-disaster management and what do we see as the way forward now this particular chart here\n22:34\nshows uh the population in Asia and Pacific as you can see here that a\n22:42\nsignificant share of the world's or the global population\n22:48\nlives in Asia and Pacific and within Asia and Pacific the South\n22:54\nAsia has the largest share of population this\n22:59\nincludes countries like India Pakistan uh which have a significantly\n23:05\ngreat population share the next region which is important here\n23:10\nis the East Asia which includes China and that again is one of the largest\n23:17\nmost populated countries in in the world and China is also one of the most vulnerable countries in terms of\n23:24\ndisasters Southeast southeast Asia as the third largest\n23:31\nregion with with regard to population in Asia and the Pacific\n23:37\nso you can see here is that uh the population that resides in this part of\n23:44\nthe world is quite a large share of the global population not only that\n23:51\nin terms of density this is also one of the most dense areas in the world\n23:58\nsupport this in the context of disaster what it means is that the impact of any\n24:04\ndisaster on this region would be quite significant and negative\n24:16\nthis chart shows the old age dependency ratio so what we see here is that over a\n24:23\nperiod of time the ratio of population which is older in in\n24:31\nthe total population that has increased no South Asia is\n24:38\ndominated by uh largely the young population in 2020 but as we go in the future the\n24:48\nshare of older population is increasing the Eastern Asia has the largest\n24:55\nuh share of old population in in the region now why this is\n25:01\nimportant this is important because disasters affect different people differently\n25:08\nthe most vulnerable are those with disability those who are in the older\n25:15\nage and those who are younger or children they are the ones who suffer\n25:20\nfrom disasters the most it affects their um\n25:26\nlivelihood it affects the ability to cope with disasters and it takes quite a\n25:32\nlong time to rebuild the losses which they suffer\n25:39\nthe other important aspect of the region is that it's urbanizing very fast\n25:44\nso you can see here the East Asia which had 30 percent of their population in uh\n25:53\n1990 living in cities the share well is projected to go up to as high as 70\n25:59\npercent the situation in South Asia is also very similar from somewhere around 25 percent\n26:05\nthe share of urban population is increasing again this\n26:11\nthis is important because what it means is that the impact on\n26:17\ncities would also be quite substantial of any\n26:23\ndisasters that would occur and as we have seen in many countries that\n26:28\nin cities such as Chennai and India the impact of uh repeated typhoons\n26:36\nhave been significant in terms of their impact on lives and livelihood\n26:43\nnow this particular picture here shows the region Asia and the Pacific and what\n26:51\nI'm going to show you is that the disasters are not concentrated in\n26:57\none region but rather the whole of the region and many countries are affected and disasters are\n27:03\nnot any particular time there are different kind of disasters that have affected the\n27:08\nregion starting with let's say I'm looking at last 30 years data here\n27:15\nand you can see that in 1990 Philippines was affected by earthquake 93 India\n27:23\non Japan um Pakistan Afghanistan\n27:29\nIndonesia China and New Zealand was one of the recent\n27:36\nexamples which were affected by earthquake and you can see the\n27:41\ntool it had on the lives both in terms of deaths and those who\n27:47\nwere displaced or affected by earthquake then there were other kind of disaster\n27:54\nlike in 1991 Philippines saw a cyclone which affected more than 6 000 people\n28:00\nthey perished in that disaster Bangladesh had cyclone India had cyclone\n28:07\nin 1998. odisa in India Bangladesh\n28:13\nMyanmar Philippines and Tonga in the Pacific\n28:19\nthen there are floods which also have significant impact on human lives China\n28:26\nhad a major flood in 1996. um India had flood in 2013 and India\n28:34\nfaces the challenges with regard to flood almost every year during the month so\n28:41\nAustralia has the disasters related to Bushfire then there are uh disasters which\n28:49\nwhich occurred together like for example in PNG there was earthquake and tsunami\n28:54\nJapan witnessed earthquake and tsunami one of the most disaster prone areas in\n29:00\nthe world Indonesia in 2018\n29:05\nso what this particular picture shows here is that the disasters the the nature of\n29:13\ndisaster are different the regions which are affected are\n29:19\nquite vast and the impact is\n29:25\nquite significant so this is a\n29:30\nimportant picture that illustrates the impact or the effect of disaster\n29:36\nthe undrr they put together a report which\n29:43\ntells us about the damage or destroyed buildings and disrupted or just\n29:48\ndestroyed livelihood in different regions due to disaster you can see here that in the Asia and\n29:55\nPacific in 2018\n30:00\nthere were 5.3 million properties that were damaged\n30:09\nthe lives and livelihood that were destroyed in 2018 was for 18 million\n30:17\npeople which is which are big number going forward the challenge of climate\n30:24\nchange is becoming important and climate change is causing uh\n30:30\nsea level rise or is predicted to cause sea level rise and also changes in the\n30:36\npattern of precipitation so what this chart shows us is that there are three scenarios here the\n30:43\ncentral the optimistic and the pessimistic scenario but what you can see is that\n30:50\nthese scenarios are related to the temperature rise\n30:56\ndue to climate change and what it says here is that pretty much most of\n31:04\nthe regions in the world which is Coastal would face inundation of some sort\n31:12\nthe one which are shown in red they indicate that even with a rise in\n31:18\ntemperature about two degrees in the next um 70 80 years would cause\n31:25\ninundation of those areas the ones in blue the temperature would rise to uh\n31:31\nmaybe more than five or six degrees in order to cause indentation what it shows\n31:37\nis that in Asia a large part of East Asia\n31:44\nsignificant part of South Asia and australasia would be what what faces the\n31:51\nchallenge of indentation foreign\n31:57\n[Music] and the disaster management cycle so the framework which is used in order\n32:04\nto understand the disaster management cycle comprised of four stages here\n32:10\nnow one is before the event and the second is after the event before the event is very much like\n32:17\nputting together the mitigation strategy or preparing oneself should a disaster\n32:22\nwould occur so here countries invest in the\n32:28\ninfrastructure countries invest in early warning systems\n32:33\ncountries invest in uh different kind of efforts that prepares them\n32:40\nagainst any kind of disaster that may occur then the second phase or the left\n32:48\nside of this particular a picture here or the third and fourth\n32:54\nquadrant here is about after the event so after the events there are two things\n32:59\nbecome important how do you respond to a disaster and the second thing is that after\n33:07\nyou've responded to the disaster in the initial phase then there is a recovery phase\n33:12\nwhich is much longer and it takes a lot of effort and resources\n33:18\nthe question that arises here is that when we look at the response phase or\n33:23\nthe recovery phase what is to be responded to and what is to be recovered\n33:29\nso what is to be responded to in the initial phase is is is is important because here people\n33:37\nare affected who are affected by the disaster they who have lost their livelihood and place to live they would\n33:44\nneed assistance fairly quickly and fairly soon recovery takes a long time\n33:49\nbecause the human lives are built over a long time and here the importance is\n33:54\nwhat are we trying to recover what are what are we trying to rebuild here and\n34:00\nthat question of what then leads to how we should rebuild and what uh should be\n34:06\nthe approach that we should take here foreign number of Frameworks that guide us in\n34:13\nsome way Japan has been at the Forefront of the\n34:18\ndevelopment of these framework or these strategies as we call them now one of the early ones was the 1994\n34:25\nthe Yokohama strategy which focused on natural disaster prevention preparedness\n34:31\nand mitigation so here the question of how do we prevent disaster how do we prepare\n34:39\nourselves should the disaster occur and how do we mitigate the incidences was\n34:45\nthe issue that was debated and discussed and put forward before the countries to take on board\n34:52\nin 2000 .45 the review of Yokohama strategy happened\n34:58\nand there was um discussion around\n35:04\ndo we have enough framework to deal with the prevention preparedness and mitigation\n35:10\nuh the Hugo framework that followed and it brought the attention to the\n35:17\npre-disaster action programs and also strengthen the capacity to respond to\n35:24\npost-disaster period so here the importance of post disaster\n35:31\nalso was underscored now there were three proposals that were\n35:36\nput forward in the yoga framework that caught attention of policy maker in Asian\n35:43\ncountries one of them was to establish New National institutions that would deal\n35:50\nwith the disasters and they will prepare the disaster management plans the other important aspect or other\n35:58\nimportant proposal of yoga framework was to mainstream disaster reduction policy\n36:04\nso it should be mainstreamed in the in the various policies and programs of\n36:10\ndifferent countries it should be mainstream in the budgetary allocations it should remain strained and um\n36:17\nthe way the disaster reconstruction happens not as a reactor but more in a plant and\n36:25\nphased manner the third important proposal was to establish a national network of local disaster reduction\n36:32\norganization so that the response to disaster\n36:39\nbefore and after is well planned and well thought not in a reactive manner\n36:49\nanother major development that happened was with the\n36:55\nSendai framework for disaster risk reduction which\n37:01\nproposed concrete steps for developing policies and programs and also for\n37:07\nmonitoring and this now became the overarching\n37:12\nframework within which the disaster management is being viewed in different countries\n37:18\nso the expected outcome of the Sendai framework is to substantially reduce disaster risk\n37:27\nand losses in life livelihood and Health Energy in the economic physical social culture\n37:35\nand environmental assets of person businesses communities and countries\n37:40\nso this is an important part how do we reduce the disaster risk\n37:47\nand loss of lives livelihood and economic activities of a country\n37:54\nso this is the expected outcome that the Sendai framework proposes what are the targets that they set for\n38:01\nthemselves one is to reduce mortality how do we reduce the the number of\n38:07\ndeaths that occur due to a disaster What policies and programs would then constitute\n38:15\nthe reduction in mortality reduce people affected as I said to you\n38:22\na number of um people who are vulnerable they are the ones who are affected the most be it\n38:29\nolder people children migrants women are disabled so they are the ones\n38:36\nwho who are affected severely in any disaster now the question or the target uh that\n38:43\nthe Sendai framework said set to the countries is to reduce the people who will be affected by\n38:49\ndisaster so again the question will arise what kind of policies and program would be put together\n38:56\nin order to achieve this target the third thing is to reduce the direct economic losses the loss of livelihoods\n39:06\nthe loss of loss which arises due to loss of economic activity in the region\n39:13\nthat is affected by disaster reduce damage to critical infrastructure like Transportation power water and\n39:22\nsanitation these are the ones which get affected by a disaster immediately after\n39:27\ndisaster and they take huge amount of time to build so how do we reduce the damage to\n39:34\ncritical infrastructure this is the target which is put forward to the countries the developed disaster risk reduction\n39:41\nframework um it's important for countries to have\n39:47\ntheir framework so that the disaster management is more of a core business\n39:54\nrather than an afterthought early warning system\n39:59\na lot of lives and livelihoods could be saved through early warning system\n40:04\nso what kind of mechanisms could assist in developing the early warning\n40:11\nsystem International cooperation the shared knowledge of different countries also\n40:17\nanother important element of the Sendai framework\n40:23\nthere are some priorities for action one is to\n40:29\nthat the country should understand the disaster risk\n40:34\nnow I I would say here and possibly many of you would agree with that the risk of\n40:41\nclimate change is still not well understood by different countries\n40:46\nthough we all know that um the climate\n40:52\nhas changed over a period of time and it's projected to\n40:57\nchange in coming future as well but the risk that it would pose either through\n41:04\nsea level rise or flooding or inundation that it will cause is not fully understood\n41:12\nso it's important uh within the Sendai framework for countries to understand\n41:17\nthe disaster risk second priority for Action is to\n41:23\nstrengthen the disaster risk governance the third important priority for Action\n41:30\nis to invest in disaster risk reduction through the mitigation strategies\n41:36\nthrough in investing in um infrastructure that can prevent the\n41:41\ndisaster risk these um could also be natural solution\n41:48\nlike for example growing mind groups in order to prevent the\n41:54\nuh negative impact of sea level rise the fourth priority for Action that the\n42:02\nSendai framework suggests is to enhance disaster preparedness for better response and bear back better in\n42:08\nrecovery Rehabilitation and reconstruction phase\n42:14\nnow this particular picture here this particular chart here shows how the disaster management is\n42:21\napproached in different countries in South Asia there are few things which come out very\n42:26\nclearly that there is no one strategy or no one\n42:33\napproach that countries have taken in terms of institutions\n42:39\nthere are differences across different countries institutional structure requires\n42:47\norganization institutional structure requires plans and different countries have very\n42:54\ndifferent um structure towards that the next important\n43:01\ndifference that arises is what what are the different infrastructure elements\n43:06\nthat are being proposed or that are being um designed in order to mitigate and\n43:13\nmitigate disaster risk now again you can see here that there\n43:18\nare different kind of um Technical Solutions that different\n43:24\ncountries are approaching in case of India the fraud control\n43:29\ninfrastructure has become quite an important one and the countries are and\n43:35\nIndia is looking at as one of the major investment in case of Nepal the mapping and early\n43:43\nwarning system have become important in case of Bhutan the drainage infrastructures slope stabilization\n43:50\nbecomes important given that the country is hilly and the risk of flooding\n43:55\nis quite significant there so it's important to appreciate and\n44:00\nunderstand that the mitigation strategy would be contextual and they would differ from one country to another so\n44:07\neach country would have to have their own plans uh in terms of\n44:13\npost-disaster there are here there are big gaps you can see that\n44:20\nthere are different approaches that countries have taken but largely the\n44:25\npost disaster reconstruction focuses on shelters and damage\n44:30\ninfrastructure reconstruction now what would ask is that the only laws\n44:36\nthat people face and to what use or to what contribution\n44:42\ndo these shelter make to a life of an individual\n44:48\nand how is that restored how is that life restored\n44:55\num different countries have put together different mechanisms to finance [Music]\n45:01\ndisaster mitigation and adaptation these range from public and private\n45:09\nsources in the sense that budgetary allocation or special funds to the\n45:14\nprivate sources such as insurance which in case of Asia the penetration of insurance is quite low compared to rest\n45:21\nof the world which makes this little difficult to use insurance as an instrument\n45:29\nand then finally um there are other issues related to what is restored and what uh capacity both\n45:38\nTechnical and resource that different countries have in order to manage disaster again the experience differs\n45:47\nthere are some issues that emerge from Global disaster risk reduction progress monitoring this\n45:55\nmonitoring is done uh post Sendai framework countries are required to report how\n46:02\nthey are doing on the Sendai framework and then undrr compiles that they\n46:10\npublish report on the progress of different countries so there are some issues which become important here\n46:18\nnow the first issue that comes up is that most disaster\n46:24\npost-disaster reconstruction focuses on the financial compensation\n46:31\nso since the focus is on financial compensation the\n46:37\nlosses that different stakeholders different individuals face\n46:44\nis not recorded to the extent it should be\n46:50\nso they in most countries the disaggregated human loss indicators are missing\n46:56\nnow the consequence of that is it makes it difficult to plan\n47:02\nthere is no disaggregated data on human laws by sex by age or other criteria\n47:10\nsuch as disability or migrants versus non-migrant those kind of disaggregated\n47:16\ndata is not available so it becomes difficult to strategize\n47:23\nfor an individual or for a particular segment of society as a focus\n47:32\nthe exposure to a disaster and its consequences for human is long-lasting\n47:38\nthat is one of the issue that comes out very clearly from the gdr progress\n47:43\nmonitoring report now what that means is that what should be the duration of\n47:50\npost-disaster reconstruction if it's long how is it going to be\n47:57\nfinanced who will be involved so these are some of the questions which become important\n48:03\nexposure to disaster and vulnerability is higher for low income household and those living in low and medium income\n48:10\ncountries the problem here is that while the vulnerability is higher\n48:15\nthese countries may not have the capacity to uh\n48:22\naddress those reconstruction related issues that arise\n48:29\nbecause the lack finances the lack technical capacity they also lack\n48:35\nresources the report also found that the illegal\n48:40\nimmigrants are left out most are disaster reconstruction\n48:47\nthat focuses on uh it focuses on\n48:52\nthose who have formal titles former Land Titles it focuses on those who can prove\n48:58\ntheir residency the ones who are illegal immigrants are generally left out\n49:04\nwhich is a problem from the humanity point of view because each human being\n49:11\nis equally important irrespective of their tag whether\n49:17\nthey're legal or illegal and the challenge here is that if that\n49:22\ntag becomes important in any kind of disaster reconstruction work that will leave some people out of that\n49:30\nnet informal settlements are inadequately reported most countries\n49:38\ndon't have adequate data on\n49:45\na population that lives in the informal settlements and the kind of infrastructure losses that they face so\n49:52\nwhich makes it difficult for any post disaster reconstruction work because they are inadequately\n49:58\nreported losses and productivity and well-being are not covered\n50:08\none important point that I want to make here is about the financing instrument\n50:15\nnow in case of disaster\n50:21\ndifferent sources of finances have to be pulled together however\n50:27\nthe disasters have very different timeline in the sense\n50:34\nthat there is an initial phase which is a relief phase and then there is a reconstruction phase which is much\n50:40\nlonger so the finances that are\n50:46\nthat can be used or that are used during relief phase are very different than the\n50:52\nsource of finances that are used during the Reconstruction phase so in this lovely chart that guest\n51:00\nsquare and Mahal prepare on the vertical axis they have the severity of disaster on the horizontal\n51:07\naxis they have the frequency of disaster now the disasters which are\n51:13\ncatastrophic in the sense that which have high severity they are less frequent while there are\n51:20\nlots of those disasters which are high frequency but their\n51:25\nseverity is lower like for example uh every monsoon\n51:30\num some part of India pays flooding so this is a frequently occurring disaster\n51:36\nand given the climate change it will be extenuated further so those are\n51:43\nlow severity but high frequency event now the risk associated with\n51:52\nthese different types of disasters are different and hence the financing instrument\n51:57\nthat would be required to to finance so the\n52:04\npost it is also reconstruction would also differ um what\n52:10\nthese authors propose is that the disaster which are low severity and high\n52:16\nfrequency that can be financed largely by the resources\n52:22\nthat a country has their own reserves or budgetary allocation\n52:28\nthey can layer it with the credit which is\n52:34\num which is for the specific purpose as the severity and\n52:41\nseverity of disaster increases because it would require much larger fund to\n52:47\nmitigated to address the Reconstruction phase\n52:52\nas the severity increases so does the cost the results would not be sufficient the\n53:00\ncredit would not be able to supplement the whole cost\n53:05\nprivate Market or insurance would have to play a role and the insurance could take a part of that\n53:12\nthen what they say is that as the severity increases the cost of reconstruction would also rise here the\n53:19\nrole of um much broader Market Finance and also of international\n53:27\ndonor assistance would be necessary so as you would see in the disaster which\n53:33\nare quite major like for example Asian tsunami which happened in 2004 or\n53:38\nPhilippines typhoon there was a significant role that the International Community played because the the sources\n53:46\nthat were available within a country that were not sufficient to meet the cost of post-disaster reconstruction\n53:53\nit is important for us to understand the limits that each of these different\n54:00\nsources of Finance has here this chart is\n54:06\nuh to very quickly show you the limits that the markets have\n54:12\nin case of Asia the non-life insurance penetration is very low\n54:17\nso Asia non-life Insurance penetration has roughly about 1.5 percent of GDP\n54:28\nso developing this Market would take\n54:33\nquite a lot of time and this as a source though important\n54:39\nit's efficacy and efficiency and post disaster reconstruction in Asia\n54:45\nbecomes questionable based on the experiences different uh\n54:53\ninstitutions are put together framework or guidelines\n54:58\nso World Bank has put together some guiding principles for\n55:03\nreconstruction now these are important what they are saying here is that the\n55:10\nReconstruction Begins the day of disaster it's not that there's a phasing where\n55:16\nrelief has to finish first and then the Reconstruction begins people lose their lives and livelihood on the day one\n55:23\nand it takes a while before they can resume their work\n55:31\nand hence it is important that the reconstruction also Begins the day the disaster happens\n55:39\na good reconstruction policy helps reactivate community and empowers people\n55:44\nto rebuild their housing lives livelihoods in a better and safer way\n55:49\ncommunity plays a very important role the social network plays a very important role in\n55:56\nthe Reconstruction process The Social Network\n56:03\nis lost due to disaster however that also helps in rebuilding\n56:12\nlives and livelihoods for people reconstruction has to be sustainable to\n56:18\ncontribute to a long-term development the community members should be partner\n56:23\nin policy making and leaders of local implementation as we would see in some\n56:29\nof our case studies this point has been highlighted however many of the post-disaster reconstruction\n56:37\num Community Viewpoint is usually ignored\n56:43\nthe technical assistance that is provided the Reconstruction worker work\n56:49\nthat happens usually doesn't take account of\n56:54\ncommunity views or the shared view in reconstruction which causes problem\n56:59\nand acceptability of any other solutions that are being designed or planned\n57:05\ncivil society and the private sector plays a vital role they should play a vital role\n57:11\nreconstruction policy and plans should be financially realistic but ambitious\n57:17\nwith respect to disaster risk reduction institutions of matter and the\n57:23\ncoordination among them improves outcome institutions are formal and informal\n57:30\nrules institutions are policy and programs and institutions are also the\n57:36\nmechanism through which these rules regulations are enforced\n57:41\nthey are important they are important in the Reconstruction process\n57:49\ncoordination is one of the key issue and many of the\n57:55\ncases that we see is there are issues of coordination failure among agencies that\n58:02\nare involved there which then results in some optimal outcome\n58:07\nreconstruction is an opportunity to plan for the future and carry lesson learns from the past\n58:15\nrelocation disrupts lives and should be minimized\n58:20\nnow this is in the context of uh post-disaster reconstruction\n58:26\nthe question of Institute versus relocation becomes an important one\n58:32\nassessment and monitoring can improve reconstruction outcomes\n58:37\nevery reconstruction project is unique now this is an important one so you cannot have\n58:44\none suit fit all solution it has to respond to the context it has to respond\n58:52\nto the effect that the disaster has had so these are some of the principles\n58:58\nwhich seem quite easy to understand they\n59:04\nof very clearly articulated however in\n59:10\nprinciple when you try and Implement these they become quite challenging\n59:18\nthere is an interesting paper which Safa poor and his colleague they put together\n59:24\nwhere they were looking at what are the barriers to reconstruction now they put this in\n59:32\nfive buckets one related to the management and coordination resources\n59:39\nsocial and cultural physical and Territorial and legal\n59:44\nwhat becomes most important many of the respondents who were there who they were interviewing they said that the\n59:50\nmanagement and coordination is one issue which comes out very high as barrier for\n59:58\nreconstruction management and coordination between government agencies\n1:00:04\nmanagement coordination between non-governmental organization management and coordination between government and\n1:00:11\nngos and Community organization management and coordination issues between multilateral institution or\n1:00:17\nInternational donors private public governments ngos cbo's and so on so\n1:00:24\nthere are lots of agencies who are involved here and this becomes one of the major challenge\n1:00:31\nthat the Reconstruction works for your face resources are important\n1:00:38\nnot only the resources but timely flow of resources are also important\n1:00:45\nboth technical material as well as human resources\n1:00:52\nsocial and cultural context is important when a large disaster occurs many of the\n1:00:59\ninternational agencies and Aid workers are involved there\n1:01:05\nwho are new to the context and sometimes it becomes challenging for them to understand the social and cultural\n1:01:11\nissues the physical and territorial issues Philippines the hyana\n1:01:19\ntyphoon the context was very difficult the road infrastructure was destroyed\n1:01:26\nand what it meant was that at many times the material was the way transported\n1:01:31\nthrough sea the physical and territorial challenges are also quite significant\n1:01:39\nand the legal issues the the whole uh question about land titling\n1:01:46\ncomes up repeatedly again and again in the Reconstruction work\n1:01:54\nI'll very briefly talk about some of the lessons from the research that has been\n1:02:01\nconducted around post disaster reconstruction and what kind of key messages that\n1:02:07\nemerge from the the first is about vulnerability\n1:02:13\nnow we have to understand this as I said earlier in the initial part of my talk\n1:02:19\nin this session is that disaster affects different people differently\n1:02:26\nwomen are much more severely affected\n1:02:31\nthan men that disasters for women on the verge of\n1:02:37\nlosing livelihood and asset because in general what we see here that\n1:02:42\nthe land and property rights of women are not acknowledged uniformly and what happens then is that their\n1:02:50\nclaims during the post disaster reconstruction become very weak\n1:02:56\nthe loss of job and livelihood opportunity leads to migration there are lots of\n1:03:03\npeople who are displaced one of my earlier slides showed that that disaster due to disaster a number of people get\n1:03:09\ndisplaced so there is a problem with the migration or the migrant worker because they don't\n1:03:17\nhave access to the Securities uh Social Security schemes\n1:03:22\nit's very difficult for migrant workers to earn a living\n1:03:29\nand contribute to\n1:03:35\num the resources of the family platform who depend on their remittances\n1:03:43\nthe second lesson what we have in the post disaster reconstruction is on the community participation\n1:03:52\nfirst of all let me say this to you is that the notion of community\n1:03:58\ndetached from a particular locale is not the same\n1:04:04\nas the community in the first place so when a community is dislocated\n1:04:12\nit disrupts the notion of community itself however During the Reconstruction\n1:04:18\nto the extent possible the effort should be to establish\n1:04:25\nrelationship between people and between people and the land\n1:04:33\nin the post-wars setting like for example a number of disaster uh have\n1:04:38\nhappened where the conflict is also an important issue\n1:04:44\nin case of bundash in Indonesia\n1:04:50\nthe conflict the political conflict it was an important issue in case of Sri\n1:04:56\nLanka when the Asian tsunami happened the local conflict\n1:05:02\nwas a persisting issue which also affected the Reconstruction world so the\n1:05:07\nissue here what what the lesson suggest here is that\n1:05:16\nin the post-wars setting affected communities are often conceived\n1:05:23\nas being disabled they are they are not considered as someone who would be able\n1:05:29\nto contribute in terms of knowledge or ideas during the recovery process\n1:05:35\nand are hardly ever consulted During the Reconstruction so what it does then it builds up\n1:05:43\ntension between the people who who are affected whose\n1:05:49\nlives are being rebuilt and those who rebuild that life\n1:06:00\nit's also important um that the responses to disaster or\n1:06:05\nconflict should not be seen as purely technical or political nor should their field of action be\n1:06:12\nviewed as clean slate that here it is on no context exists and hence we have to\n1:06:19\nstart from the beginning it should be important to take\n1:06:24\nthe full cognizance of the social relations the political context that\n1:06:31\nwere there before during and after the emergency\n1:06:36\nparticipatory processes are important involving people as important wherever people have been\n1:06:42\ninvolved and design and reconstruction the satisfaction and success rate have\n1:06:48\nbeen higher\n1:06:53\nthe community participation is also able to rebuild other aspects of infrastructure and economy not just the\n1:07:01\nimmediate needs of the people but the broader economic infrastructure as well\n1:07:09\nusually it is stated that people the lay people may not have the\n1:07:15\nknowledge so involving them doesn't necessarily do any good but however it must be understood that\n1:07:21\neven though they may not have the technical expertise but they\n1:07:27\ntheir involvement would assist in the\n1:07:32\nrecovery time management because the buy buying of some of those initiatives will\n1:07:37\nbe much larger people are involved there are also lessons related to\n1:07:44\nprivate Finance the low local government revenue and insufficient Insurance are huge barriers\n1:07:51\nso the immediate relief after a disaster is very local\n1:07:57\nand as some of the cases that we would discuss later illustrate that the\n1:08:02\ninitial responses were largely private individual people themselves were trying to\n1:08:07\nbuild their lives out of their own saving and resources the local government revenues or local\n1:08:17\ngovernment contribution before the national or International funding comes in plays an important role\n1:08:25\nbut many of these governments have very strained budgetary position\n1:08:30\nthe insufficient insurance as I said earlier in Asia the\n1:08:36\npenetration of insurance is very low so that makes it again challenging\n1:08:42\nin some countries like in Australia um\n1:08:47\nthe insurers have also played an important role in promoting the\n1:08:53\nmitigation measures so here Insurance require that\n1:09:00\nthe insurance insurer should have sufficient mitigation measures related\n1:09:07\nto floods and so on when they are buying a house insurance for example\n1:09:15\nin case of Housing and livelihood generally people are satisfied with the\n1:09:23\nhousing that is provided\n1:09:28\nand if the housing that is provided in situ the satisfaction is much larger\n1:09:35\nrelocation poses challenges and people are usually not happy because it not only disrupts\n1:09:42\ntheir social ties but it also affects their livelihood so it is important lesson there that as\n1:09:48\nfar as possible the Reconstruction should be um nc2\n1:09:58\nthe other important aspect is that it is important that the recovery funds are\n1:10:04\nthat are designed to restore livelihood are distributed effectively many times\n1:10:10\nwe have seen that the challenges arise because they are inequities in the\n1:10:15\ndistribution of funds\n1:10:21\nreconstruction settlement should be linked to formally existing livelihood and promote gender\n1:10:28\nequity through improving their situation\n1:10:36\nand post-disaster circumstances people need job for rebuilding their lives\n1:10:41\nso after disaster the jobs are usually lost and it's important that\n1:10:47\nin order to survive people need income they need quick re-establishing of their jobs\n1:10:55\nso the unemployment could put a major obstacle to the path of future recovery\n1:11:01\nand this is an important area that must be addressed immediately\n1:11:08\nHigh rate of unemployment also results in other social health like for example\n1:11:14\nincrease in crime or trafficking and so on so it's important that the question of\n1:11:21\nlivelihood becomes the Paramount in the reconstruction\n1:11:29\none of the lessons that were highlighted after the tohoku 2011 disaster\n1:11:35\nwhich was a major disaster and um\n1:11:40\nfor the tsunami affected fishing Village who had shifted on a higher grounds in\n1:11:48\norder to uh take safer uh safer space for themselves\n1:11:59\nthat what would happen to those areas those locations that were vacated\n1:12:06\nit was important it happens that after the disaster some\n1:12:11\npeople who are who relocate themselves may never return back to their original location\n1:12:17\nso how the land that has been vacated\n1:12:23\ncould be utilized what if functions for those vacated low-lying land\n1:12:31\ncould be designed becomes a question During the Reconstruction process\n1:12:47\nthe the 2011 disaster in Japan\n1:12:54\nalso provided an important lesson about planning\n1:13:01\nso During the Reconstruction process the\n1:13:08\nplanning of the area that was affected\n1:13:13\nwas facing the challenge because many of the\n1:13:19\npeople who had left the village they were not going to return back\n1:13:25\nso in that case the planning similar to the similar to the situation\n1:13:33\nbefore the disaster would not be a great solution\n1:13:38\nnow this must be acknowledged and it is important to develop and\n1:13:45\nalternative Revival plan with inputs from the community\n1:13:53\nand prepare for some strategies\n1:13:58\nthat would be more suitable rather than trying to replicate what was originally originally there\n1:14:09\nthere are some lessons from the social and cultural aspects also\n1:14:14\nnow it's important to understand that the people who have better education who are educated\n1:14:21\nthey are more likely to survive extreme events and cope better during the recovery period\n1:14:29\nhaving a large number of disabled and elderly individual is a social barrier\n1:14:34\nso it's important that the recovery teams or the support team take into consideration\n1:14:41\nof these individuals in terms of their accommodation in terms of facility for\n1:14:47\ntheir relocation and services during immediately after the relief time\n1:14:54\nthe women and children are the most vulnerable particularly in temporary shelters so how their Safety and\n1:15:00\nSecurity are ensured becomes an important concern\n1:15:06\nuh it's important that the debris that the disaster lay behind\n1:15:12\nis cleared as soon as possible because these have significant psychological and negative impact otherwise\n1:15:22\nCommunity play a very important role the women have significant\n1:15:31\nshare to contribute in the reconstruction their demands and the way of living\n1:15:38\nplays a very important role so it's it's necessary that their views are taken\n1:15:45\ninto consideration During the Reconstruction now one other lesson that comes out from\n1:15:54\ndifferent cases is that the majority of disaster affected communities were not satisfied with the resettlement\n1:16:01\nbecause of various cultural issues we need ethnic religious social environment and so on\n1:16:08\nso participation of indigenous communities is important\n1:16:13\nand one from the knowledge point of view and the second is also from the effect\n1:16:21\nthat it has on them which is very different in case of Indonesia one of the\n1:16:27\ncommunity uh um which use the indigenous knowledge to\n1:16:32\ncommunicate about disaster they had less losses in terms of deaths\n1:16:38\nand displacement compared to the others institutions play a very important role\n1:16:45\nthere are some great lessons uh particularly from countries like Australia\n1:16:53\nand New Zealand after a number of disasters\n1:17:00\nwhich Australia has faced over time which provide great examples of what\n1:17:07\nkind of institutions should um should be developed in order to look at\n1:17:15\nthe disaster management as a whole yeah\n1:17:21\nthe building Act is another important area so which\n1:17:27\nwhich then um suggests that what should be the disaster resilience strategies\n1:17:34\nshould be looked at in the design and construction of building\n1:17:41\nso what happens is that when there is a disaster the buildings have to be constructed\n1:17:48\nfairly quickly and at times what happens is that if we stick to the building\n1:17:53\nregulations of building guidelines or bylaws it takes time\n1:17:59\nand by that time the community is become\n1:18:04\ntired and frustrated and the dissatisfaction bells in so it's\n1:18:09\nimportant that the building codes the Norms the take into account\n1:18:15\nthat the recovery has to be fairly quick\n1:18:20\nand how that can be made quick without being uh\n1:18:27\nobstructive so these are some of the lessons which we have learned and I guess as we go\n1:18:35\nalong in this Workshop and look into the cases\n1:18:40\nor we will try and see some of the key issues that have emerged in those\n1:18:46\nso I'll stop here and if there are questions at this stage would be more\n1:18:51\nthan happy to take on board if there any observation please do share\n1:18:56\nbecause this session we broadly looked at the context of post-disaster\n1:19:01\nreconstruction and also looked at what literature is suggesting to us\n1:19:11\nthank you very much Professor piyush um if anyone have any questions we still have yeah sakshi let's go ahead thank\n1:19:18\nyou yeah so uh thank you professor piyush and uh so I I was really uh for\n1:19:25\nme this was first time I'm listening to so constructively on what post disaster\n1:19:31\nconstruction means and so I have a question like in Bihar state of India\n1:19:37\nyou see like North Bihar and South yeah not Bihar is is flood prone every season every season comes and there is a flood\n1:19:43\nand when the flood goes the monsoon season goes away and people they just come back so I always like feel that\n1:19:52\num there should be something done but uh nobody knows how like government is just\n1:19:57\nused to of like this is seasonal every every year it will come and it will go and so as you like there are so many\n1:20:03\nNorms like building uh building norms and this should be done but in a place\n1:20:09\nlike Bihar in India it's it's very difficult to like follow all the um the\n1:20:15\nnorms and regulations and everything so in such cases what what should be the approach and I think it's the same\n1:20:20\nsituation in many of the developing countries as well so thank you very much I think that's a\n1:20:27\nvery uh important question for us to ponder upon today um\n1:20:33\nthe issue that probably this brings to is that what is lost in the whole\n1:20:39\nprocess so the shelter the infrastructure they are all material thing they're all\n1:20:45\nresources they all contribute to something so what is lost so whenever there's a flood people are displaced it\n1:20:51\naffects their lives it affects everything it affects children's education their health and so on and so\n1:20:57\nforth right so when we are looking at disaster reconstruction what could then contribute to ensuring\n1:21:05\nthat some of these well-being Things Are reconstructed and fairly quick manner\n1:21:12\nbuildings building bylaws they are all important but what is also important is\n1:21:19\nthat like if people are displaced how can we ensure that this shelter security is there\n1:21:25\nhow can we ensure that their children have the education access to education or they will have access to the\n1:21:33\nlivelihood that's not that for the immediate period after the monsoons that\n1:21:39\nthey would have no income to live on and they would be living on some kind of support so how can we rebuild some of\n1:21:45\nthese things quickly there's no straight answer to that I have not given you any straight answer\n1:21:50\nto that but these are some of the issues that we need to think upon that's what we intend to do in our workshops today\n1:21:58\nif there are any I would also like to say that look uh sakshi has raised an\n1:22:03\nimportant point if anyone from the participants or Dr shitla or anyone else would want\n1:22:10\nto um contribute to this discussion please do that because we are trying to\n1:22:16\nco-create knowledge here\n1:22:23\nI think as you were mentioning in your presentation piyush that there are disasters which are high frequency but\n1:22:30\nlow impact there could be more emphasis on social insurance systems in place to\n1:22:36\nhelp people uh come back to normal and this is also a category of disaster where mitigation\n1:22:45\nwill play some important role because as a society we are\n1:22:50\nacknowledging more and more with each experience of disaster that these are social constructs as opposed to Natural\n1:22:58\nconstructs because what nature does is in place but what impact it has on human\n1:23:04\nsettlements is is more of a social construct and more so within that\n1:23:10\nSociety who is the most vulnerable and how can we protect them the more in the most uh\n1:23:18\nappropriate manner is a social construct so having social insurance for the most\n1:23:24\nvulnerable probably could be a strategy to uh bring them back to life sooner\n1:23:31\nthan later and how can we mitigate is something that as push that is definitely beyond\n1:23:38\nthe scope of this Workshop but definitely an important question when it comes to high frequency low impact\n1:23:45\ndisasters thank you\n1:23:50\nthat's a great one um thank you very much Judy and Rosa Bush and also sakshi\n1:23:56\num so now we're going to go into 10 minutes break um no it's 11 22 Tokyo time so we'll be\n1:24:04\nback on in like 10 minutes time uh so please feel free to grab your drink and\n1:24:10\nthen we will be back here in 10 minutes thank you very much yeah see you soon\n1:24:34\nwe can probably start the second session\n1:24:44\ngood afternoon Ricky yes we can start the second session yeah please feel free to start recipe and you can share the\n1:24:52\nscreen again thank you very much\n1:25:10\nthank you very much and warm welcome to the session two So the plan for session\n1:25:15\ntwo is to look at the post disaster reconstruction practices\n1:25:21\nfrom select case studies so we have taken a few of the case studies in order\n1:25:28\nto understand what are the key stages of the Reconstruction what are\n1:25:34\nthe institutions involved and what are the key challenges that emerge out of that now\n1:25:39\nhere I would request the participants to also put on their hands as let's say post\n1:25:47\ndisaster reconstruction uh worker or planner\n1:25:53\nand maybe put forward some of your ideas that you think would be important when\n1:26:01\nwe are looking at now another thing what I would like to say is that\n1:26:07\nin order to um\n1:26:12\nstart with understanding the scale and magnitude of the disaster we'll look at\n1:26:19\nsome of the videos now these videos have graphic details of\n1:26:25\ndisasters that had occurred in the cases and could be disturbing for some if you\n1:26:32\nthink that these are disturbing for you then please uh\n1:26:39\num stay away for maybe five or ten minutes\n1:26:45\nwhen the video is being shown and joined later I know that there are people who are\n1:26:51\nfrom Indonesia and Philippines so joined us today and since the case studies are based on\n1:26:59\nthese countries so uh if you feel Disturbed please do\n1:27:04\nlet me know in the chat box and um maybe I would\n1:27:10\nuh try and suggest to you that possibly you can\n1:27:16\navoid watching the video for a while and then you can come back\n1:27:22\nso let me start with the first two case studies these relate to Asian tsunami\n1:27:28\nand we would be examining the disaster that occur at\n1:27:34\nthat time the impact that it had in two countries in particular in Indonesia and the Sri Lanka\n1:27:42\nI will show the YouTube just to\n1:27:47\nshow you what kind of what was the disaster and what impact it had before\n1:27:53\ngetting to the post-disaster Reconstruction that followed This Disaster\n1:28:07\nplease let me know if you're able to um hear the sound it will take a couple of\n1:28:14\nminutes thank you\n1:28:54\nno sorry we cannot hear it prose abuse okay\n1:29:09\nno still not um do you want me to share it um you can\n1:29:16\nshare the link um let me\n1:29:22\ntry to share this let me try and show you this yeah when you share the screen just make\n1:29:28\nsure to the box of shares sound um okay\n1:29:34\non the left corner [Music]\n1:29:44\nare you able to hear no it's breaking up but um we can see the\n1:29:53\npicture but not the audio so do we keep would it be possible to share this YouTube uh from your end sure\n1:30:00\nuh would you meant to share the link with me you can share it on the chat box yeah okay\n1:30:31\nforeign\n1:30:39\nagain one second\n1:30:50\num drink if you can share that and avoid the first minute\n1:30:56\nokay sounds good I will play from uh the second minute\n1:31:18\nlet me share it one second foreign\n1:31:41\nit spread in the deep ocean as an inconspicuous wave Crest with a height\n1:31:47\nof a few meters at a speed of around 800 kilometers per hour approximately 40\n1:31:54\nkilometers offshore the coastal shell began to rise and the wave began to rub\n1:32:00\nmore strongly against the everizing bottom this caused its considerable slowdown\n1:32:08\nbut also its hate gain gradually a wall of water approximately 30 meters high\n1:32:16\nand 200 kilometers wide was formed as it continued to approach the shore\n1:32:24\nthe wave reached the shores of Asic approximately 20 minutes after the\n1:32:29\ntremor the most devastating impact was on the town of mulabo a town of 50 000 which\n1:32:38\nstood directly across the epicenter and protected by any natural barrier such as\n1:32:44\nan island or coral reef according to surviving Witnesses a few\n1:32:50\nminutes after the Tremor the Sea receded ominously by 500 meters exposing the\n1:32:56\nseabed people had no idea that this was a warning sign of approaching wave in a\n1:33:03\nfew minutes the seabed was again flooded with rapidly advancing one meter high\n1:33:09\nfoamy water moments later a wall of water approximately 25 meters high\n1:33:15\nappeared on the horizon Witnesses said that it made sounds like\n1:33:21\nan approaching heavy storm\n1:33:39\nalthough people made a forensic Escape within minutes the wave swept into the\n1:33:44\ncity destroying 80 percent of the buildings in an instant killing about 10\n1:33:51\n000 people and reaching a distance of five kilometers from the coast\n1:33:57\nthe wave continued to devastate entire areas to the north towns Villages forests and Fields\n1:34:06\ndisappeared in a blink of an eye longer is a small Coastal Community\n1:34:13\nabout 13 kilometers Southwest of panda Asic located on a flat coaster plain\n1:34:20\nbetween two rainforest covered Hills overlooking a large Bay and known for\n1:34:26\nits large white sandy beach and surf Witnesses described the arrival of the\n1:34:33\nwave as follows as the Earth shook the sea immediately\n1:34:39\nreceded temporarily revealing massive coral reefs\n1:34:44\napproximately 20 minutes later huge black waves about 35 meters high\n1:34:50\nappeared on the distant Horizon the first wave came very quickly a\n1:34:56\nfrothing mass of water about two and a half meter high the second and third waves were between\n1:35:04\n20 and 35 meters high and by the time they reached the shore they looked like\n1:35:11\ngigantic waves suitable for surfing but to quote taller than coconut palms the\n1:35:17\nsize of a small Mountain the tsunami washed ashore large ships\n1:35:23\nand destroyed a cement Mining facility near the lampuk coast where the tsunami\n1:35:29\nreached the fourth floor of a building all infrastructure in the area was\n1:35:34\ndestroyed and approximately 6 000 people died\n1:35:43\nthe wave then reached the very Northern tip of Asic where the provincial capital\n1:35:49\nband where the population of 250 000 is\n1:35:54\nlocated here an interesting phenomenon which we'll encounter in later episode as well\n1:36:01\noccurred and that is diffraction even though these islands were in the\n1:36:08\npath of the tsunami and absorbed much of its energy from the West the wave thanks\n1:36:14\nto diffraction encircled the islands intensified its effect and hit the city from this\n1:36:21\nnorthwesterly direction the inhabitants were caught completely unprepared most of them trying to get\n1:36:29\ntheir loved ones out of the aftershocks unaware of the destruction that was\n1:36:35\ncoming foreign\n1:36:44\nlocal eyewitnesses described the arrival of three large waves with the first wave\n1:36:51\nslightly inundating the sea and rising to the foundations of coastal buildings\n1:36:57\nfollowed a few minutes later by a sudden and massive Retreat of the sea at the\n1:37:03\nPort of Yuli Louis a few minutes later two large black\n1:37:09\ncolored steep waves appeared eyewitnesses described the tsunami as a\n1:37:16\nblack giant a mountain and a wall of water the height of the Waves when they\n1:37:24\nreached the shore is estimated at 20 meters and it's therefore clear that the\n1:37:30\ncoastal District was Swept Away With Enormous Force video footage taken by an eyewitness\n1:37:37\nshows torrents of black water rushing through the windows of a two-story\n1:37:43\nresidential neighborhood located a whopping 3.2 kilometers inland\n1:37:50\namateur footage shot in the middle of the city additionally captured water\n1:37:55\ngushing through the city streets the depth of the water current in the\n1:38:02\ncity was at the second floor level witness footage also showed the Asic\n1:38:08\nriver flowing back in a strong current carrying large amounts of debris and\n1:38:15\npeople from destroyed villages on the coast this debris was found up to 40\n1:38:21\nkilometers inland especially in the Northwestern part of the city the level of Destruction was\n1:38:28\nExtreme as these photos show the tsunami claimed approximately 60 000\n1:38:36\nlives in the city in total the tsunami in Indonesia\n1:38:42\nclaimed 168 000 lives and caused enormous damage to\n1:38:47\nproperty and the economy of the entire region most of the damage has now been repaired\n1:38:54\nand the City of Banda Asic has undergone significant modernization\n1:39:00\nunfortunately however it is ill prepared for the next tsunami Warning Systems\n1:39:07\nhave been installed but passive protection in the form of massive breakwaters such as those in Japan for\n1:39:14\nexample is still lacking the horrors of the 2004 tsunami are\n1:39:21\ncommemorated by several memorials that remind of this worst disaster in\n1:39:27\nIndonesian history\n1:39:36\nuh right so I'm going to share my slides\n1:39:51\nso tsunami 2004 that occurred in Asia\n1:39:58\nit was a major disaster as you can see from that uh nine minute video that we\n1:40:03\njust saw one choice to look at the impact of that disaster\n1:40:09\nit was tremendous the cities were destroyed the lives and livelihoods were\n1:40:15\ndestroyed and it did not only impact Indonesia Indonesia was the largest impacted\n1:40:22\ncountry but it also impacted many other countries in the region like Sri Lanka\n1:40:28\nIndia Thailand and so on the total loss of life was 227 000 and\n1:40:38\nin addition to the loss of life almost 2 million people were displaced because of\n1:40:44\ndisaster now this scale\n1:40:49\nof impact is significant\n1:40:56\nand substantial and also when one is looking at it\n1:41:01\nhappened over a very short period of time so the kind of losses that one would\n1:41:06\nlike to assess becomes very difficult in these situations and many of the\n1:41:12\ndisaster organizations and disaster Aid workers they face this challenge\n1:41:18\none is to kind of restore or start the relief work as early as possible given\n1:41:24\nthe number of people who have been affected here and also to reasonably accurately assess the losses\n1:41:32\nthat people might have faced so let's start with our first case which\n1:41:38\nis Indonesia now let's start with what was the\n1:41:43\neconomy at that time now as you saw that everything was destroyed the economy was\n1:41:49\nimpacted severely but they were other issues that the region was also facing\n1:41:54\nwhich could have an impact on disaster post-disaster reconstruction process\n1:42:01\nso the main economic activity in uh in the region was agriculture oil and gas industry\n1:42:10\nnow agriculture a large part of the population depended on agriculture and one of the impact that the disaster\n1:42:18\nhad that many of the Agricultural activity just could not happen\n1:42:23\nafter the sea level um the the water percolated inlands the\n1:42:31\nland became um difficult to be cultivated because there was salinity and all those other\n1:42:36\nissues that emerged with that oil and gas industry was largely unaffected\n1:42:43\nbut however the contribution of oil and gas industry while important\n1:42:49\nfrom the people's point of view it was not as much as the agriculture of\n1:42:55\nfishing there was another issue that the region was facing there was a socio-political\n1:43:00\nconflict between free us a moment and the Indonesian government\n1:43:06\nso the Free as a movement was um uh armed Rebellion movement which\n1:43:13\nwanted also to be free from the country and that also\n1:43:20\nhad um its history in making\n1:43:25\nbut from the post-disaster Reconstruction point of view the trust between the local people there and the\n1:43:33\ngovernment was already quite weak which then as you would understand would have\n1:43:38\nan impact on the post-disaster Reconstruction process and work\n1:43:44\nin terms of the impact in case of two major regions or seniors\n1:43:51\nthe total number of houses that were destroyed you know or damaged in aseva 390 000\n1:43:59\nIndia's 538 so it's quite a significant uh scale that we were looking at in\n1:44:06\num I'll say 10 percent of the population was affected in years almost 76 percent of population was reflected\n1:44:14\nthe loss of primary source of income for\n1:44:20\nsignificant population in both these areas number of horses houses were destroyed\n1:44:27\nand um there were a number of household members who lost their lives\n1:44:35\nmental illness was a significant challenge so in this case\n1:44:41\nthe numbers that we have here are have been compiled it shows quite small two\n1:44:47\nor three percent but I'm sure that these are Under report\n1:44:55\nso who wore the burden again coming to the question that the\n1:45:01\nburden is not born by all all the people in equal way\n1:45:13\nso in in case of um the Asian tsunami in in Indonesia the\n1:45:19\ndisproportionate burden of loss was private as the people who lost lives people who\n1:45:26\nlost houses and other assets that they had economic assets as well\n1:45:32\namong the economy the economic sectors like Agriculture and Fisheries they suffered major losses\n1:45:38\nso where the dependency on agriculture and Fisheries was large\n1:45:45\nthey had a significant impact on people who were dependent on that as you would\n1:45:51\nunderstand that Agriculture and Fisheries are much more disaggregated and individual level\n1:45:58\nactivities rather than a firm or a company based activities so the impact\n1:46:03\nof the disaster was far more disaggregated\n1:46:09\n30 percent of people who live below the poverty line in 2004 it was estimated\n1:46:14\nthat the numbers um increased to almost 50 percent by\n1:46:19\n2005. there was significant loss of income the loss of boundaries because part of\n1:46:26\nthe land went under sea it caused significant land right issues and the\n1:46:33\nburden of which was again largely borne by the vulnerable communities\n1:46:39\nso if we look at the relief reconstruction and Redevelopment uh\n1:46:45\nstages of of the post-disaster Reconstruction there are some activities which were\n1:46:53\nrequired to be conducted immediately some in medium terms and some in long\n1:46:59\nterm the medium term and long term is essentially the Reconstruction and the Redevelopment stages\n1:47:06\nso in the immediate it was important that the people who have been affected\n1:47:11\nthe food supply the Clean Water the basic health services and temporary shelter are provided on priority basis\n1:47:18\nthe question of funding came up now the scale of disaster was such that\n1:47:25\nthe whole world was um ready to help\n1:47:31\nso this was one of the major Aid effort that happened after the disaster\n1:47:38\nbut then um since it was disaggregated or distributed across many different\n1:47:43\nagencies and organizations that pose its own problems so the floor funding initially in the\n1:47:50\nimmediate aftermath of after the disaster\n1:47:56\nthe first source of funding was people's own saving their own funding they were trying to recoup their lives\n1:48:03\nthrough their own saving again you would understand that those who had less resources would\n1:48:10\nsuffer in this situation then the next the central government was fairly quick\n1:48:15\nto respond and allocate budgets to for Relief work\n1:48:20\ndomestic and international organizations also stepped them overall and the immediate relief there\n1:48:28\nwere 250 domestic and international agencies were involved now the question\n1:48:33\nthat this will raise is how the activities of so many agencies who\n1:48:40\nsuddenly landed up in um asked the region was coordinated it was challenging and\n1:48:49\nquite [Music] um problematic\n1:48:54\nto coordinate so many individuals so many Aid workers and so\n1:49:00\nmany agencies however despite all that the relief work\n1:49:07\nuh progressed to reasonable satisfaction and some of the agencies\n1:49:15\nthey claimed success though that's a questionable thing but it did\n1:49:21\nreach a stage that initial relief was fairly responded to in a very quick\n1:49:27\nManner and also it could um it could affect\n1:49:35\na significant number of people in positive way then they came the second stage which\n1:49:41\nwas the next one to two year which was the reconstruction stage now a number of\n1:49:49\num activities were to be conducted there the economy was affected the shelter were destroyed and so on and so forth\n1:49:56\nso the sectoral approach the sectors that were looked at were agriculture\n1:50:02\nFisheries Enterprises health education water supply infrastructure everything had to be\n1:50:08\nbuilt the question that it poses to us that\n1:50:17\nhow what should be the way in which these activities should have been built\n1:50:25\nthe approach was very sexual in the sense that they were agencies and\n1:50:31\norganizations who were involved in rebuilding the agriculture officially or so on and so forth\n1:50:39\nin terms of flow of funding again the funding came from number of sources from International the grand\n1:50:46\nmany uh the debt moratorium for Indonesia on loan repayment there was a debate there\n1:50:53\nwhether the loan should be waived off or um should they be a moratorium\n1:51:00\nso the international agencies they took the stand that moratorium would be better in order to avoid any kind of\n1:51:06\nmoral hazard problem in the future there were country donors many countries\n1:51:14\num were contributing funding for the Reconstruction the loss of organization\n1:51:21\nand private donations as well so there was 78 countries which were involved 30\n1:51:26\norganizations and many norms again if you think about it in a\n1:51:33\nsituation where the mechanisms are not there to coordinate\n1:51:38\nthe activities in a cohesive and coordinated way with so many countries so many\n1:51:46\npersonnels involved it could cause problems in the long term\n1:51:53\nmore than two years the new projects were initiated\n1:51:59\nthe new components to the existing projects were added added the assistance\n1:52:05\nfor government programs was also provided a multi-donor fund was set up\n1:52:10\nto coordinate activities of International International donors and Grant agencies\n1:52:20\nso the institutional approach how did how did Indonesia approach\n1:52:26\nwhat kind of institutions were involved the planning agency open us they were\n1:52:32\ntasked to prepare a master plan for reconstruction\n1:52:38\nhowever the problem with the master plan initially was that they did not it was a central agency\n1:52:45\nwhen I was a central agency they did not consult the local government and the ngos non-governmental\n1:52:52\norganizations who were involved they were also not consulted so they were not\n1:52:57\nfully brought in the discussion in the preparation of master plan and hence\n1:53:02\nthey were unsatisfied so local government felt that they were being ignored their voices were being ignored\n1:53:09\nthat became a problem in the initial master plan development\n1:53:15\nthe second was restoring livelihood\n1:53:20\nand strengthening communities for this\n1:53:26\nan agency called um badon reconstructing then\n1:53:31\nrehabilities was formed whose task was to restore\n1:53:36\nlivelihood in its strengthened community the third important work was the peace\n1:53:41\nagreement between free assay movement and the Indonesian government now this was important for\n1:53:49\nthe Reconstruction work to progress because the trust in the past has been\n1:53:55\nweak between these two it could have had significant negative\n1:54:02\nimpact on any progress with regard to reconstruction and hence in a region\n1:54:08\nwhich was already conflict Zone the peace agreement was necessary\n1:54:14\nnow this is an interesting slide which tells us the complexity\n1:54:22\nand the multiplicity of the organizations who were involved in funding the reconstruction\n1:54:29\nso there are donors there are intermediate agencies through\n1:54:35\nwhich the funding was channeled and then they were recipient or implementers the\n1:54:41\nagencies who were implementing the projects so you could see here that there was\n1:54:47\nfunding from government of Indonesia foreign governments multilateral organizations ngos companies and\n1:54:54\ncommunities while the scale was large but\n1:55:00\nit was a complex web through which money flew\n1:55:06\nanother interesting challenge that this post is that\n1:55:11\num it became very difficult to assess the scale of funding that was offered number\n1:55:19\none and also the accountability was a question and how the funding\n1:55:26\nwas coordinated to different projects that wanted taken for reconstruction\n1:55:34\nso the sequencing of emergency and Recovery it took many\n1:55:43\nyears as one would one would understand so in the initial phase immediately\n1:55:49\nafter the disaster the first stage was the emergency response the relief work\n1:55:55\nso you could see here that the level of activity that involved in first one one and a half year was emergency of relief\n1:56:04\nonce that was addressed that required temporary shelters to be constructed the\n1:56:09\nwater supply to be restored the health and sanitation\n1:56:14\num addressed and so on the Reconstruction\n1:56:19\nwork started and one of the priority there was the housing\n1:56:25\nthen once housing progressed the physical and social\n1:56:30\ninfrastructure was with the roads the power lines the telecommunication and so\n1:56:36\non livelihood and business to the very long\n1:56:41\ntime to rebuild and the process still continuing\n1:56:50\none of the issue that\n1:56:55\nRises here and that concerns me is if you look at many of these activities\n1:57:01\nseem this connector disjointed here\n1:57:08\nlike the housing was separated from livelihood\n1:57:14\nwhich was separated from physical and social infrastructure in their reconstruction\n1:57:20\nso the agencies involved were different the funding was different so the plans\n1:57:26\nwere different they were all separately designed which was causing significant\n1:57:32\nissues there the multiplicity of agencies who were\n1:57:37\ninvolved for establishing land rights given that as I said to you earlier us a part of\n1:57:44\nthe coast was inundated because of which uh people who owned\n1:57:50\nland along the coast they were left with a very weak or poor land rights so\n1:57:57\nestablishing land Rights was an important nature During the Reconstruction and this was\n1:58:05\ndone by land Administration agency bpn\n1:58:11\nhousing was provided by numerous agencies both domestic and international\n1:58:17\nmany of the aid agencies were involved in housing either shelter repairs\n1:58:24\nor shelter reconstruction or provision of new housing\n1:58:29\nlivelihood again the livelihood different agencies had different approach towards\n1:58:36\nlivelihood which again caused problem schools there were other agencies then\n1:58:41\npublic infrastructure largely the international agencies like jaika usaid\n1:58:47\ntogether with the government their Ministry of public worlds and the funding was provided by ADB and the\n1:58:55\nplanning was done by brr so you can see here the multiplicity of agencies that\n1:59:01\nwere in war in the whole reconstruction process the challenge that it poses if\n1:59:08\nis if there is no framework for the coordination and each of these agencies will have\n1:59:15\ntheir own objective their own goals like many of the ngos they had their own objectives their own goals and their own\n1:59:23\nreporting structure word post problem\n1:59:30\nnow here I will pause for learning before I go into Sri Lanka and\n1:59:37\nask you to identify\n1:59:43\nkey issues that you see in the way the reconstruction\n1:59:51\nlosses were identified and also in the way the Reconstruction happen you can write\n1:59:58\nyour response in the chat box\n2:00:54\nokay um maybe we can park this question for a little later yeah I think there's\n2:01:00\none comment here Anna is writing here for the housing how was the beneficiaries identified\n2:01:06\nin the higher reconstruction beneficiary identification was a huge issue yep\n2:01:11\nreconstruction is delayed all laws are used to yeah absolutely\n2:01:19\nso I think what you can see here this is a question which is an important one\n2:01:26\nhow the beneficiaries were identified how the old laws impact the\n2:01:35\nReconstruction process so this again uh if you remember in the\n2:01:40\nfirst session I was mentioning that uh the building laws the planning norms and so on and so forth\n2:01:46\nthey become a hindrance rather than a support particularly when we are trying\n2:01:51\nto reconstruct in Fairly shorter manner so how do those laws accommodate so these are important questions these are\n2:01:57\nvery important questions that you have raised here and this would form the basis when we\n2:02:02\nwere trying and identify the losses and the mechanism to restore that in our data section\n2:02:15\nthank you\n2:02:21\nso let me go to the next case which is Sri Lanka again Sri Lanka was affected as I said earlier with a 2004 Asian\n2:02:30\ntsunami but Sri Lanka was facing other problems as well at that time\n2:02:36\nsince 2001 the crisis happened in 2000 the tsunami happened in 2004 but Sri\n2:02:41\nLanka already had a weak economy following 2001. they their economic\n2:02:47\ngrowth had slowed down inflation was a problem and they were also facing the balance of payment crisis\n2:02:54\nthere was also the political um conflict that the country was facing\n2:03:00\nwith LTT so when the disaster struck\n2:03:05\nit affected a large proportion of the country\n2:03:11\nthere were numerous deaths about 30 000 people lost their life number half a\n2:03:16\nmillion people were displaced and roughly about hundred thousand houses were destroyed and you can see here the\n2:03:23\nsouthern western eastern and Northern Province they were all affected\n2:03:28\nso one of the issue here was that these regions are very different\n2:03:34\npolitically as well so um when the Reconstruction progress not\n2:03:41\nall the region had a very similar kind of condition in\n2:03:47\nwhich reconstruction could happen which meant that in some regions some\n2:03:52\nprovinces the Reconstruction progressed fairly quickly compared to others\n2:03:59\nso again in the same frame if we try and see what are the kind of activities that\n2:04:06\nare involved in the Reconstruction process and how they were funded so the activities in the immediate they\n2:04:13\nwere largely relief activities they're related to food water funeral expenses the basic health\n2:04:20\nservices and temporary shelter now generally this was as was done in\n2:04:25\nIndonesia largely done through own funding of people and through Sri Lankan\n2:04:31\ngovernment contribution yeah the international agencies and other\n2:04:37\nsources of Finance started coming in for the medium to long term rebuilding\n2:04:44\nso again like Indonesia Sri Lanka also took a sectoral approach\n2:04:50\nthey were not looking at the whole reconstruction as in a holistic way rather it was in a sector of fragmented\n2:04:58\nway which again is an issue particularly when you are trying to rebuild the whole\n2:05:03\neconomy and whole society the funding came from International\n2:05:09\nsources the government of Sri Lanka private donation and also the microfinance played a very important\n2:05:16\nrole in Sri Lanka there was already a basis for that and that was leveraged during uh the post disaster\n2:05:24\nreconstruction the challenges also are not very different\n2:05:29\nthere was policy confusion related to the buffer zone the buffer zone was a no\n2:05:35\nbuilt Zone was a declared around the coastal area\n2:05:42\nso that the future losses could be avoided but there was a confusion because that was an arbitrary buffer\n2:05:48\nzone the problem was that the people Lively heard dependent on fishing\n2:05:54\nthey needed excess and housing around in those so this became an issue\n2:06:01\num then the housing there were two types of housing that was that was\n2:06:07\nhousing reconstruction that happened one was owner built in the sense that the owners were provided with the Grant and\n2:06:14\nthey built their own houses or the second was donor build lots of these Aid agencies who are on\n2:06:20\nthe ground they built houses the progress on owner built was far better than the donor belt donor face\n2:06:28\ntheir own challenges one in terms of they had their own design their own preferences or material there was a lack\n2:06:35\nof consultation with community and so on the coordination problem among donors\n2:06:40\nwas also a major thing given that different donors have their own priorities their own objectives and the\n2:06:48\ncoordination issue is a significant one they were inequities in housing Provisions in some region the housing\n2:06:56\nhouses that were that were constructed were far greater than that were damaged\n2:07:02\nin other regions they were short form so they were inequities and this largely\n2:07:07\nwas the result or consequence of the political conflict that the country was facing\n2:07:14\nuh Sri Lanka has faced number of disaster both natural and non-natural man-made due to political\n2:07:21\nconflict generally people are quite resilient so the evidence of trauman's trusts were\n2:07:28\nlow though this is something uh to be\n2:07:34\nrecognized that trauma and stress are important losses\n2:07:45\nin terms of institutional in the immediate um the country appointed at the national\n2:07:52\nlevel a commissioner general of essential services to coordinate activities of various Ministries various\n2:07:58\ndepartments and responding to the\n2:08:04\nto the disaster there were three task forces that were set up one was\n2:08:10\nto rescue and relieve second was Law and Order and third was rebuilding the nation\n2:08:16\nagain the problem here is that um these are three silos that were created\n2:08:24\nwhile the activity of reconstruction should involve all three\n2:08:30\nthey were created as silos so the coordination and collaboration\n2:08:36\nbetween these activities and task forces became an issue\n2:08:42\nso in medium to long term these three task forces were combined together in a\n2:08:48\nnew constituted agency called reconstruction and development agencies so the Reconstruction and development\n2:08:55\nagency was responsible for planning and coordinating the Reconstruction efforts in addition there were a number of donor\n2:09:02\nagencies and international ngos who were involved there so when we look at the response the\n2:09:10\ntsunami uh response and how it was\n2:09:16\nmanaged there are a number of reports there is huge amount of evaluation work that has happened and let me say this\n2:09:23\nthat the purpose of this Workshop is not to evaluate if any effort or any thing\n2:09:29\nbut just to learn some of the lessons and that will help us in\n2:09:35\nidentifying key issues and post disaster reconstruction and design it\n2:09:40\nforeign\n2:09:48\n[Music] they raise a very important issue here\n2:09:56\nwhat they say that some International agencies they managed well but many did\n2:10:01\nnot the local context institutions and contributions were frequently neglected\n2:10:08\naffected people's will and capacity to move from Reliance on handouts so rebuilding their lives were inadequately\n2:10:15\nexploited people were marginalized even undermined by an overwhelming flood of\n2:10:22\ninternational agencies controlling immense resources now while on paper it looks good that's\n2:10:29\nso much of Aid money came into the rebuilding process but the problem here\n2:10:36\nis that people had very less agency affected\n2:10:43\npeople had very less agency in the whole reconstruction process which\n2:10:49\nsignificantly affected their\n2:10:55\nesteem as well as marginalize them in case of Sri Lanka there is an\n2:11:02\nimportant study by Institute of policy studies and they they write that many ngos lack\n2:11:09\nexperience and local knowledge because many of the Personnel that was deployed\n2:11:15\nwere coming from another context another country who had very little experience\n2:11:20\nof local knowledge and in their haste to spend money they disregarded local circumstances and\n2:11:26\nCommunity needs so this again is an important issue here that how the local circumstances a\n2:11:33\ncommunity needs are understood and taken on board in any reconstruction process\n2:11:39\ncost blowouts will almost certainly create funding gaps make reconstruction tasks difficult and impose further\n2:11:47\nstrain on government fiscal expenditure the budgets were all short by a big\n2:11:54\nmargin one of the challenge that the disaster\n2:11:59\nreconstruction workfaces that happened in Sri Lanka that happened in Indonesia is the inflation that uh purses but that\n2:12:08\npossessed after the disaster this increases the cost of Labor this\n2:12:15\nincreases the cost of materials which then means that the initial\n2:12:24\nuh estimates of cost become irrelevant\n2:12:31\nthe U.S government accountability offers they in their report they quoted that\n2:12:37\nalthough both of its signature project won in Indonesia and the other in Sri Lanka underway\n2:12:43\nusaid has increased initial cost estimates reduced or canceled some\n2:12:49\nproject activities and may extend completion dates so what happened was because of rise in cost\n2:12:56\nsome of the projects have to be canceled but think from the people's point of view who initially were to\n2:13:04\nreceive say their houses or whatsoever and um some of them were scaled down or some\n2:13:11\nof the projects were canceled that could have significant impact on their well-being\n2:13:19\nthe World Bank tsunami report on Sri Lanka said that at completion there are still about 15\n2:13:26\n000 families in need of permanent housing so the progress was slow and not everybody\n2:13:32\nuh could get covered within a reasonable time frame\n2:13:37\nand thus we are looking at three year after the disaster so even after three years fifteen thousand families they\n2:13:44\ndidn't have did not have permanent housing they were still living in temporary shelters and generally who these are these are\n2:13:51\nlandless families and due to this increase in housing need with only about\n2:13:56\n8 million remaining additional fund would be required so\n2:14:01\nthe problem is quite significant here\n2:14:15\ncan I before we go to the next case which is um Philippines\n2:14:22\ncan I ask you again to write some of the observation based on\n2:14:29\nthe Sri Lanka case as well as the final report outcomes that we saw from\n2:14:36\ndifferent countries\n2:14:41\nthe idea of writing these observation at this stage is that when we start our\n2:14:48\nsession second phase where we try to identify losses these questions will\n2:14:54\nbecome an important guidance for you to ask again how should the Reconstruction\n2:14:59\nhappen\n2:15:47\noh\n2:16:01\nif there are any challenges that you think are there that you would want to write\n2:16:06\nin the chat box\n2:16:12\nokay maybe what we should do let's park it for the moment and um as we go along if you think that\n2:16:19\nthere are some key issues that you want to highlight please do that uh Ricky can I request you that there is\n2:16:26\nanother uh YouTube link this is regarding typhoon I am just to look at\n2:16:33\nthe scale and the Damage that it caused might be worth looking at this YouTube sure if\n2:16:40\nyou can um just share the link again via chat box and then I can\n2:16:45\nyep um you can actually click on that and then\n2:16:51\nand then copy it yeah and then copy it\n2:17:01\nthank you\n2:17:35\nforeign\n2:17:41\none second\n2:18:09\nAnderson Cooper can you hear this town left completely flattened by this yes we\n2:18:14\ncan okay so that's good Anderson we hear the mayor is urging people there to get out of town as\n2:18:22\nquickly as possible and people are certainly heeding that\n2:18:29\nwarning they are they've been trying to get out frankly for five now moving into the sixth day uh since the storm I mean\n2:18:35\nI can tell you about 300 feet 400 feet from where I'm standing there is already a line of people and they have been\n2:18:41\nstanding all night many of them standing all day yesterday just waiting uh residents here just waiting for\n2:18:48\nPhilippine military aircraft to to come they could come about once or twice a day uh and and off get some people on\n2:18:54\nthose C-130 planes get them to Manila get them to Cebu or just basically get them anywhere but here people just are\n2:19:01\ndesperate to get out there is really in the Direction all behind me Jake there there is really nothing I mean the\n2:19:07\nhouses are gone the Shacks are gone people are still looking for food still desperate for water even the people\n2:19:15\nstanding in line here at the airport will come up to you with an empty water bottle and and you know ask you if you\n2:19:20\nhave any water supplies are running low for everybody and you talked about the the the the the the aid come in it is\n2:19:27\ncoming in uh in the last 24 hours the last 12 hours in particular uh there has\n2:19:32\nbeen a big uptick on it a brigadier general uh Kennedy the the Marine uh General uh in charge of this uh of this\n2:19:39\noperation here at the airport promised to get the airport up and running on a 24-hour basis he has done that planes\n2:19:45\nhave been coming in during the night there is AIDS stacked up I just walked by pallets and pallets of it from usaid\n2:19:51\nuh tarps thousands of tarps that could be used for people to shelter under these the the brutal heat under the rain\n2:19:58\nthat comes in intermittently but the problem as you say is getting it out from this Airfield now to the\n2:20:04\ncommunities even to communities you know a mile away from here half a mile away from here there aren't trucks\n2:20:10\nthere aren't there's not fuel we're we're running out of fuel to even broadcast uh it is a very very dicey\n2:20:16\nsituation here and the bottom line is more needs to come more Logistics more trucks uh more fuel in order to actually\n2:20:24\nget this Aid to the people who need it most Anderson is there any indication\n2:20:29\nthat the Philippines government knows that the problem is getting all the aid\n2:20:34\nand the tarps that that you are talking about that that are right near you that they know that they need to be able to\n2:20:40\nprovide soldiers or police or whomever to provide that to the survivors who need it and that those reinforcements\n2:20:48\nare coming to do that job or is everybody just sitting around waiting and wondering when help like that will\n2:20:54\narrive you all you know there are there are hundreds of Philippine police and and\n2:21:00\nMilitary here at the airport and and elsewhere at roadblocks and such but you don't see them out uh going block by\n2:21:08\nblock searching for bodies searching you know there I haven't seen any search and rescue operations even in the the\n2:21:14\nimmediate days after the storm you know you think back to the the tsunami in Japan back two years ago or three years\n2:21:20\nago within a day there were Japanese Defense Forces out with they didn't have heavy Earth moving equipment they were\n2:21:27\njust out on foot uh walking block by block you know they divided up communities that has not happened here\n2:21:33\npeople are left to their own devices I was with a mother who was searching for her six dead children yesterday she'd\n2:21:39\nfound three of them she'd have to carry their bodies place them under some sacks but she was still looking for for her\n2:21:44\nthree other children her husband she'd already found his body and there's just no one to help these people\n2:21:51\num you know people here are very resilient they're used to being abandoned by their government for generations for decades certainly and\n2:21:58\nyou know there's not a high expectation on the part of a lot of people here of of outside help or governmental help and\n2:22:05\nthat is certainly their expectations have certainly been met um I think you know the government must\n2:22:10\nknow what's going on it's just a question of uh ability and and Logistics they just they don't they are not the\n2:22:16\ntrucks available uh to to get Aid out here that's something certainly the Marines are hoping to work on in the\n2:22:22\nnext couple days but it's uh it's still a very desperate situation it's so heartbreaking Anderson I know you did an\n2:22:27\naerial tour of the damage today you'll be showing that on your show later this evening what did you see out there give\n2:22:33\nus some perspective of just how bad things are in some of these towns\n2:22:39\nyeah you know we went out with the Marines in their uh their Osprey Aircraft which have now started to fly which really allowed them to get into\n2:22:44\nsome places that they others have not been able to get into so we went to a nearby Island about a 30-minute flight\n2:22:50\nfrom here called Samar um you know again it's Devastation it's one Island after another all along the\n2:22:56\nSouth uh that's that's just destroyed you know we landed with a member a a a\n2:23:02\ncaptain from the the Philippine special forces from the the from the Navy um and you know he was talking to people\n2:23:08\nhe was trying to get an assessment of of the damage and the bottom line the message is more supplies we need food we\n2:23:14\nneed water and in these small communities there there's only about according to this Captain only about 15 or 20 percent of these communities that\n2:23:21\nhave actually been assessed so there's still a lot we don't know about what's going on in some of these outlying places all right Anderson Cooper and\n2:23:26\ntoclobin thank you so much stay safe my friend thank you very much um Vicky so\n2:23:35\nlet me share the slides again\n2:23:46\nso trichon ion was a major gust of wind\n2:23:52\nthat swept across different Islands in Philippines and you can see here in\n\nI have these transcript, can you make summary for this?",

      "content": "Certainly! Here's a summary of the transcript:\n\n---\n\nThe workshop, hosted by ADBI, focuses on sustainable approaches to post-disaster reconstruction. Dr. Dale Rahu and Professor Piyush Tiwari provided opening remarks, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and resilience in disaster-prone regions like Asia and the Pacific. The workshop aims to explore post-disaster reconstruction from a policy and institutional perspective, rather than a technical one.\n\nThe agenda includes sessions on identifying post-disaster losses, theoretical approaches to reconstruction, and case studies from countries like Indonesia and Sri Lanka, focusing on the 2004 Asian Tsunami. Key challenges include coordinating multiple aid agencies, addressing the needs of vulnerable populations, and ensuring community involvement in the reconstruction process.\n\nThe workshop highlights the importance of understanding the broader context of well-being in post-disaster settings and the need for integrated approaches that consider economic, social, and cultural dimensions. The session also addresses the issues of funding, policy confusion, and the impact of political conflicts on reconstruction efforts.\n\nThe speakers stress the necessity of improving institutional frameworks and coordination among various stakeholders, including international agencies, local governments, and community organizations, to enhance the effectiveness of post-disaster reconstruction and build resilient communities.",

which\n2:24:18\nwas unparalleled as you can see here and it happened in such a quick manner again the similar\n2:24:25\nkind of issues the supplies were cut off the infrastructure were destroyed so the aid could not reach that fairly quickly\n2:24:33\nand obviously uh the coordination and other issues which became a problem so\n2:24:38\none would say that like look this these are the preparedness challenges but\n2:24:44\nthese are also the Reconstruction challenges because what it means is that\n2:24:49\nhow do we reconstruct given that uh such a kind of issues are persistent and\n2:24:57\nprevalent so we'll look at some of those things that were done but before that this is\n2:25:03\nthe scale of damage so you can see here this is the chakraman city uh\n2:25:09\nthe ones in red where the buildings were destroyed and the ones which are in\n2:25:15\nlight brown that's where the buildings those were the areas which were highly\n2:25:21\naffected the pictures on right or some of the picture at the bottom is the airport\n2:25:27\nthe City was destroyed completely in the sense that most of the buildings were gone\n2:25:34\nthe impact there was 6 300 deaths\n2:25:40\n28 000 people who were injured four million people were displaced\n2:25:45\nthe house is destroyed or damaged were about 1.1 million so total economic estimated economic estimate of the\n2:25:52\nlosses was about 12.9 billion thank you again we go with the same length so\n2:25:58\nrelief reconstruction and Redevelopment what kind of activities are in so in the immediate\n2:26:08\nfood water basic health and temporary shelter were the key largely done my own funding and the\n2:26:16\nresources or the funding that was allocated by the government and that took time but that also was an\n2:26:22\nimportant contributor here in the medium to long term\n2:26:27\num the housing and infrastructure same kind of sources of funding\n2:26:32\nInternational donor private donation and government agencies\n2:26:38\nthey were servant there were 78 organizations who were involved in the\n2:26:43\nhumanitarian shelter resistance so just imagine the the number of organizations that get\n2:26:50\ninvolved in any disaster the department of social welfare and development provided emergency shelter\n2:26:57\nassistance so emergency shelter assistance was the contribution in cash\n2:27:03\nor material watches that were provided to\n2:27:08\nto affected households um who had low income or who were below\n2:27:15\npoverty line and met certain other criteria in order to provide them with\n2:27:20\nsome initial relief now the challenge here is that you know\n2:27:26\nemergency shelter resistance let's say if it was ten thousand\n2:27:32\nnow that cash was not cash so people used a process of\n2:27:38\ndiscounting them in the sense that they provided those vouchers to the material providers\n2:27:47\nwho gave them material worth 8 000 and once the cash came in 10 000 they paid\n2:27:54\nthem ten thousand so there was those kind of issues that emerged during the emergency shelter resistance as well\n2:28:02\nso here what we will do in this case we'll look at the progress or shelter programs\n2:28:08\nbecause they were 78 organizations in Pokemon and many of them were doing the\n2:28:13\nshelter reconstruction shelter construction so they had a very different approach\n2:28:19\nthey they bring very different kind of challenges\n2:28:24\nthat one could see there so the total shelter need was about a\n2:28:30\nmillion and you can see here um they were almost half a million houses\n2:28:35\nwhich were completely destroyed and some half were partially destroyed\n2:28:41\nand on the right we have a chart here which which which shows the progress\n2:28:47\nfour years after the disaster so to the right or the government programs and the\n2:28:53\nhumanitarian assistance program so among the government programs only the progress was very slow only four\n2:29:00\npercent of the houses were constructed there was a gap the government had\n2:29:07\ntaken up to do 20 of the shelter needs but there were 16 percent Gap the\n2:29:13\nprogress was very slow in case of humanitarian assistance which was pretty\n2:29:18\nmuch largely led by the ngos or paid agencies the progress\n2:29:25\nwas relatively better 34 of the houses were complete there was a gap of 16\n2:29:31\npercent what is important here is that for about 30 percent of household there\n2:29:38\nwas no assistance provided now that raises a significant question here in the sense that if there are so\n2:29:46\nmany people who are still struggling what would that do to to their\n2:29:51\nwell-being so the response was quite slow\n2:29:58\nthe shelter programs there were two types of shelter programs\n2:30:04\nthat were undertaken by different agencies one was short term these were temporary shelter assistants of two here\n2:30:11\nso there were three types of things done there one was transitional shutter second was rental assistance and here\n2:30:19\nthe affected persons were provided with some kind of rental assistance so that\n2:30:24\nthey are able to access rental housing in the market and the third is the hosting in the\n2:30:29\nsense that they could live with a family who can host them and the cost was met\n2:30:35\nthrough um through funding that was provided to The Host\n2:30:43\nthen they were permanent shelter assistants which were programmed for\n2:30:48\nrepair and retrofitting construction of core shelter which could be expanded\n2:30:54\nas the households in need increased and the third is resettlement and relocation\n2:31:01\nfrom those vulnerable areas to another areas\n2:31:07\nso what I'll do is very quickly look through uh some examples of\n2:31:15\nthe shelter programs and pause at each of them for to see\n2:31:22\nwhat you think about the responses that were there let's start with the transitioner these\n2:31:30\nare the temporary shelter and chocolate um Jack bro so that you can see in the\n2:31:38\npicture here picture to the left top is the kind of\n2:31:44\nre uh transitional or homes that were built temporary shelters that were built\n2:31:51\non the far end you can see that those are the houses which are already existing so this was\n2:31:58\non a land next to those houses which were there where the temporary shelter was provided the\n2:32:06\ntoilets the right picture here or the toilets\n2:32:11\nwhich are Community toilets at the bottom the water was an issue\n2:32:18\nso the water was supplied through tankers and you can see the queues so let me pause here and\n2:32:26\nask you to reflect on the temporary\n2:32:31\nshelter provisioning approach\n2:32:36\nand from the two perspective one what is the gap here\n2:32:42\nand what could be done\n2:32:50\nplease unmute yourself and you can talk\n2:32:56\nwith a broader audience here\n2:33:09\nhello yes good morning I'm uh from Tacloban City and uh I was here in in\n2:33:18\nTacloban when high and devastated us uh let me tell you that uh I have I am\n2:33:25\nnot really I know what's this uh comfortable with the so-called transitional shelter because uh for me\n2:33:30\nit's a double ex expense uh people would uh would would\n2:33:36\nrather daughters spend on this transitional shelter and after two\n2:33:44\nmonths the survivors were uh transferred to the so-called permanent\n2:33:51\nsites unfortunately because I think of the absence of an accurate data uh\n2:33:59\nhousing whether transitional and permanent were constructed in excess that's all right right and what do you\n2:34:07\nthink were the challenges that people faced during\n2:34:13\nthe period that they lived in transitional shelters were there any kind of concerns\n2:34:20\num I think I I I I know I observed and wrote this in one of my uh paper that\n2:34:27\nfor women it was quite difficult because uh uh of the location of the Comfort\n2:34:34\nrooms most transitional shelters did not have an attached Comfort rooms and there\n2:34:41\nwas a problem of water uh they also of you know uh\n2:34:46\nsomewhat because it's made of light materials security was also a problem\n2:34:53\nsecurity of a solves a problem there were instances of a break but especially the younger ones\n2:35:00\nyeah thank you very much and may I also ask you if you were to reflect on this\n2:35:06\ncould this have been done in any different way uh I wish we were prepared because uh\n2:35:15\nthe the construction of the transitional shelter could have been avoided but\n2:35:21\nrather if we have good buildings I started once people could have been\n2:35:28\nsafer safer unfortunately because these unforeseen and we didn't expect this we\n2:35:35\nwere not prepared maybe at that point uh it was the only option left especially\n2:35:42\nthat this was given uh from the donors people outside the city uh came here to\n2:35:51\nhelp us materially and physically I think at that moment that was the best\n2:35:58\nthank you very much thanks a lot so let me go to the next one\n2:36:04\num this is the um another one from chuckleman repair\n2:36:10\nand retrofit so here are the houses that were partially damaged they the\n2:36:15\nhouseholds were provided with some kind of training and also assistance to\n2:36:20\nrepair and retrofit now here the\n2:36:26\nmaterial that was used was local however the skills and with skill and training\n2:36:32\npeople were able to partially retrofit their homes\n2:36:37\nare there any observations on what could have been done differently or\n2:36:43\nwhat were the challenges with repair and retrofit\n2:36:50\nuh okay let me share with you that on repair and retrofit as far as the\n2:36:58\nstructure is concerned this this quite an unstable this quite durable but there\n2:37:03\nwere no there were other forms of repair and the retrofit where uh survivors were\n2:37:10\ngiven uh materials such as copper Lumbers and because of the fear of the\n2:37:16\nstorm surge uh some of them would repair by putting up a second floor without\n2:37:22\nconsidering the materials that they're going to use whether it would withstand\n2:37:29\na strong wave or not they were just so you know uh enamored with the so-called\n2:37:36\nsecond floor they they panic because uh of the threat of the storm surge so\n2:37:42\npractically after high end people wanted a second floor to their housing units\n2:37:49\nright thank you very much thanks for sharing this can I ask one question to\n2:37:55\nothers as well that it was fairly reasonable expectation\n2:38:00\nfrom people to um build a safer place for themselves and\n2:38:07\npossibly go another level should there be another search and see\n2:38:13\nwhat could have been a response that could have helped them and\n2:38:20\nproperly designing and building their homes rather than letting it to be more like a\n2:38:28\nself-driven activity\n2:38:37\num personally uh being in in the in the Indiana in the in ground zero in\n2:38:43\nTacloban City uh people could that could that think well at that time and uh\n2:38:49\nsince most of the people who were affected were poor and they lack uh\n2:38:55\nresources both materially and and knowledge they would just uh proceed\n2:39:01\nwith what they have with what they know so the idea of or the terms such as\n2:39:08\nbuildback better and Brazilians when high-end hit us it was new to us so we\n2:39:16\ndidn't know what the resilience is what build back better uh others would take\n2:39:22\nit literally like just uh uh going back to their old situation or bearing uh\n2:39:28\nestablishing themselves after the disaster what was uh important was there\n2:39:34\nwas a roof over our head and the people would have something to eat people was\n2:39:39\nmore concerned and livelihood in fact if we would ask them which one\n2:39:46\nwould they like to uh have first a house or a livelihood they would readily\n2:39:52\nrespond that they would prefer to have a livelihood yep I think that's a very important\n2:39:59\npoint so um the livelihood so that that brings the another important discussion which\n2:40:05\nwill take forward in our later sessions is that these uh recovery components are\n2:40:13\nnot isolated they are all linked so you cannot isolate livelihood from housing\n2:40:19\nyou cannot isolate safety from housing and livelihood and so on so while reconstructing it is important\n2:40:27\nthat they are also seen in the same way as leadland mentioned that livelihood is a\n2:40:35\npriority because people have to feed themselves first before they can do anything else so\n2:40:40\nuh and usually when the recovery or reconstruction process happens some of\n2:40:46\nthese components are um not considered as a kind of working\n2:40:53\ntogether rather they they are seen as a separate pieces which becomes a problem\n2:40:58\nokay let me go to the next project so first was the transitional then was\n2:41:04\nthe repair and retrofit the third element of shelter which was relatively\n2:41:11\nlong term was the course shelter so core shelter was again provided by uh with\n2:41:17\nthe help of many of the aid organizations and their technical staff so they try to build a core shell which\n2:41:24\nhouseholds could expand uh as their needs and resources allow them to so the\n2:41:29\npicture on the right here is that the kosher was built and you can see that household has expanded their house on\n2:41:36\nthe right they also um the the toilet facilities and so on\n2:41:42\nthey become important and sometimes they were depending on the needs and requirements they were either added to\n2:41:49\nthe house or separate from house as the household desired now do you see okay uh the other issue is\n2:41:57\nthat the materiality so what kind of material should be used for the construction should be local or\n2:42:03\nprefab and in many cases that became an issue because many of the material were foreign\n2:42:09\ndo you think that there are any concerns and issues with this one or shelter\n2:42:14\nnow you would like to share okay uh this is a good this is in Cebu\n2:42:21\nuh what I saw here about the horse shelter was not as durable as this one\n2:42:29\nbecause when we speak here of course shelter it was a housing unit that was\n2:42:34\nconstructed again of light materials and is sponsored by the the uh national\n2:42:41\ngovernment agency particularly the department of social welfare and development so I saw the coral shelter\n2:42:47\nin in G1 Eastern somewhere when I I went there so uh part of it was I know uh\n2:42:57\nmost of the the materials were really still uh light uh except for the roofing\n2:43:06\nthat they also they use now the GI sheets not the the native one and uh the\n2:43:13\nposts part of the post were concrete but again the walls were still the lighter\n2:43:20\nmaterials the one that we we you showed are about the transitional shelter\n2:43:27\nthat was the material uh being used of course there was uh a small comfort room\n2:43:34\nbehind that was the core shelter here in given Eastern summer but this one is uh\n2:43:40\ngood this is already durable right so do you think that there were any uh challenges with that particularly\n2:43:47\nwhen the material were all light material\n2:43:52\num I I'm not sure about the light materials the supply because at that\n2:43:57\ntime they were saying there was this stories uh stories were going around that contractors were having difficulty\n2:44:07\nin securing supplies and not only the supplies but also the Manpower\n2:44:12\nyeah all right okay so the technical and resource issues uh become important one\n2:44:19\nhere let me go to the next one so there was another project which was in Murray\n2:44:25\ncommand this was a resettlement project so here the households were resettled\n2:44:30\ninto purpose-built resettlement colonies a case which my colleague Jyoti will\n2:44:36\ntalk about later in case of Chennai you know and she will examine with you so here uh the houses were constructed you\n2:44:43\ncan see their concrete blocks construction and so on and pretty\n2:44:48\nmuch like a similar kind of houses being constructed at another location so what\n2:44:55\ndo you think would be challenges or concern with these kind of\n2:45:01\ndevelopments this we have this kind of structures\n2:45:07\nhere in Tacloban City some of them are have Provisions for second floor\n2:45:13\nactually so this is really the housing unit for the so-called resettlement so\n2:45:19\nthat's the common I know that's the common material made of concrete but and\n2:45:27\nluckily we have issues here about the durability\n2:45:33\nbecause we observe and this has been written\n2:45:38\nthat it was constructed substandardly substandard and also while uh\n2:45:48\nuh survivors were given this kind of Housing and in fact they expressed\n2:45:54\ngratitude because uh some of them didn't own their house and it's only with uh\n2:46:00\nyou know with uh Typhoon Haiyan that they have this new house including a\n2:46:06\nbetter structure while they were still in in the coast the problem now is access to uh the basic services and and\n2:46:13\nlivelihood uh the resettlement sites are quite far\n2:46:19\nfrom the city and since most of the high-end relocaties were uh fishermen or whose\n2:46:27\nlivelihood were uh connected to the Sea they find it hard now to get the income\n2:46:34\nto have a good income but slowly uh today there are no they're adjusting but\n2:46:39\nwe still have this kind of problem right thank you very much I think that's a very important point one is the while\n2:46:47\nland rights were important the design and quality was an issue and some of the\n2:46:53\ncomplaints about the rooms being too dark and all these are there livelihood is an important issue many of these\n2:46:59\nhouseholds have still maintained their houses close to the Sea\n2:47:04\num because this is too far from the city so these are some of the issues which become important while designing a\n2:47:11\nresettlement now then there was another project which was done this was a course shelter and\n2:47:17\nresettlement project in Cebu now again here done with an international Aid\n2:47:24\nagency you can see that the community center was built Community toilets were also built but the community toilets\n2:47:31\nbecome their functionality becomes problematic as over a period of time who\n2:47:36\nwill maintain and who will use becomes a question now while from the planning point of\n2:47:43\nview it looks good to have a community center and all that but uh in a\n2:47:48\ncommunity it may or may not necessarily\n2:47:54\num meet the expectation of the communities so\n2:47:59\nthe livelihood shift or lifestyle shift\n2:48:05\nmay not always be acceptable to the communities so while this this looks like a good\n2:48:11\nproject whether it's good or not from the community point of view is something which has missed so do you have any\n2:48:17\nviews on this one Redlin uh actually this is uh the com\n2:48:25\nset up a shelter here in the city uh you have a row house and then a separate uh kitchen\n2:48:32\nand and uh what's this uh toilet facilities of course uh I observed that\n2:48:40\nuh sometimes the doors were I know were were destroyed nobody maintains\n2:48:47\nespecially its cleanliness or sanitation that's really the problem uh let me\n2:48:52\nshare you something about about the resettlement and livelihood I would just\n2:48:58\nwant to emphasize this uh the other day no not two weeks ago I went back to uh\n2:49:06\nlater and talked to women who are into uh fish drying and I didn't know that\n2:49:13\nthey actually were awarded with uh housing units in a particular\n2:49:19\nresettlement site they're still living in the in the shore and so I asked them uh why aren't you why are you not uh\n2:49:27\nliving uh the the sea village and they said it's because\n2:49:33\nof our livelihood and they said that if only government would provide housing\n2:49:39\nwith special provision where they can place their dried fish specially during\n2:49:44\nan emergency they would not be staying in in the coast they wanted a place for\n2:49:50\nuh there you know their dried fish but the permanent units are small and could\n2:49:58\nthat uh accommodate uh there are no their their fish and other materials and\n2:50:05\nof course the smell if they're going to bring it to their house so that's one thing that I realized and I hope a\n2:50:12\ngovernment should really look into uh uh not simply building houses for for the\n2:50:20\nso-called vulnerable but consider the kind of livelihood recipients have\n2:50:26\nthank you very much I think that's a very important Point here and as we were\n2:50:32\ndiscussing that we cannot separate the two things a livelihood from the housing\n2:50:37\nI'm going to take maybe five minutes more just to wind up the session\n2:50:43\num before we take a break for lunch hope that's okay with all of you so there were a number of issues that\n2:50:51\nhave emerged from the Philippines case the there was there were problems with\n2:50:56\nthe emergency shelter assistance coordination among agencies Land Title is an issue or livelihood support and\n2:51:03\nresettlement colonies as Linden was also highlighting a material selection is an\n2:51:09\nissue some of the material were not local not contextual but they were\n2:51:14\nused uh and sell the material that were used later had the termite problems and so on\n2:51:22\na good thing in this case was that the wash and shelter was combined together\n2:51:27\nthe community involvement was always a challenge and has been a challenge and\n2:51:33\nmany of the post-disaster Reconstruction world now let me give you some of the view\n2:51:38\nfrom the field uh like what do some of the aid workers and who are working in\n2:51:43\nthe field in different countries have highlighted so a need worker from Philippines she\n2:51:50\nmentioned that we are Guided by the question is that\n2:51:56\nhow suitable are the framework for disaster reconstruction that are used so\n2:52:01\nher opinion was that we are Guided by buildback framework generally but since\n2:52:07\nNGO share their knowledge and information a framework develops and we have internal Frameworks so you can see\n2:52:12\nthat there are number of different framework through which an aid worker has to work in a disaster reconstruction\n2:52:19\nwhich poses a problem because often these Frameworks are have very different\n2:52:26\nobjectives they need not necessarily align with each other then uh another comment from\n2:52:35\na worker within the disaster relief in Australia is that there is a national platform called damage assessment and\n2:52:42\nall organizations operating in recovery process have the capability for damage assessment\n2:52:48\nand these are conducted and distributed equally among organizations so what happens is that after disaster a damage\n2:52:55\nassessment is done and which is then shared with other organizations to respond to so that's a framework which\n2:53:01\nAustralia uses in its Disaster Response an aid worker from Japan side that\n2:53:10\ndisaster management is under the Office of Prime Minister which is very high level top priority concern and they have\n2:53:17\nguidelines supporting the post disaster reconstruction however there is a section about child\n2:53:23\nfriendly spaces that every shelter shelter means shelter development needs to provide but this is not mandatory if\n2:53:31\nit is not mandatory it is not adhered to and in any reconstruction children of\n2:53:37\nwomen are the ones who are affected uh in terms of planning and resources\n2:53:43\nthe Philippines one of the main challenge that the shelter delivery faced was around Noble zone so Nobel was\n2:53:52\num designated along the coast now other issue was that the relocation\n2:53:59\nwas difficult to handle as it connected to people's livelihood as Linden was\n2:54:04\nalso saying that livelihood plays a very important role and unless that is after us it cannot be satisfactorily resettled\n2:54:13\nso in coastal areas or informal settlements you're not supposed to put people back but then where do you\n2:54:19\nrelocate them during a relocation phase where do they stay so these are the\n2:54:24\nquestions which are important but are usually uh not addressed\n2:54:30\nuh in the Reconstruction process the rising cost getting Personnel in\n2:54:35\ncountry and shortage of technical reasons for some of the issues that Philippines felt but that's not only the\n2:54:40\nPhilippines but that's in any after any disaster these are the key issues\n2:54:47\nso in Japan I think that location for a factor we will learning of their life will be quite\n2:54:56\ndifferent like where to go to school what kind of jobs on their choices will\n2:55:02\nbe very different or whether to have permanent housing the new location whether to come back to original house\n2:55:07\nor not the emotional issues where to store the good during the transitional phase so\n2:55:14\num it's important that during the Reconstruction uh there is some sort of\n2:55:20\nadvisory which can ameliorate or which can address these concerns which are real concerns\n2:55:26\nin terms of government response the the aid worker from Philippine said that the\n2:55:34\nresource of government was trained hyana affected many regions and connectivity was poor utilities took a lot of time to\n2:55:42\nestablish Transportation was disrupted so since roads were affected some of the\n2:55:48\naid agencies had to buy boats and use sea route to transport building material\n2:55:53\nso all these are challenges that become quite important logistically to\n2:55:59\nundertake any reconstruction world from funding point of view uh funding is\n2:56:06\na problem most running that the eight eight agencies face is\n2:56:11\ngoing South Pacific so Philippines was having Challenge and attracting funding even now so we are looking for funding\n2:56:19\nnot only Us by the governance too funding is needed to support day-to-day basic necessity of Effective People\n2:56:26\nnow in case of Australia the disaster relief worker said that I think one of the things that is not well recognized\n2:56:32\nis the delay in providing financial support now this is an important one or re-housing of survives because it has\n2:56:40\nterrible impact on their mental health and well-being welfare and personal well-being red tape bureaucracy\n2:56:48\ndifferent tiers of government has not helped in resilience\n2:56:55\nthe bureaucracy delays and response is another important issue\n2:57:02\num so bureaucracy is a problem\n2:57:09\nthat has been identified the other is the fatigue because the\n2:57:14\nworkers are involved one field they are they are also human being they get fatigued over time\n2:57:21\nand there are no resources for them to\n2:57:27\ntake care of their mental health well well-being so these are some of the observation\n2:57:33\nwhich we have from the field well-being is an important concern\n2:57:38\nso mental health is becoming an important issue\n2:57:43\nso this is important in Japan and other countries as well\n2:57:50\nright so I won't read all this but the core message here was that the mental\n2:57:55\nhealth and Recovery in disaster is very important so what I'll do I'll stop here I know\n2:58:03\nthat I am standing between you and your lunch and will resume after uh after\n2:58:09\nsome time is that a 50 minute break no are we looking at\n2:58:15\nit's a one hour break um but we can cut it to like 50 minutes 55 minutes if that's okay so um yeah but\n2:58:23\nbefore we go into lunch I just want to ask for a quick favor from uh each of\n2:58:28\nthe audience I've already promoted uh all of you to being the panelists so\n2:58:34\nthat you can turn on your cam and then if it is okay for you for us to take a quick picture\n2:58:41\num to turn on the cam um so\n2:58:46\num yeah just to commemorate the day and then I can take the screenshot and then we\n2:58:53\ncan go to lunch and go back to this um I can take a quick one now\n2:59:00\nprobably something like this are still ready um yes so uni so\n2:59:08\nsakshi and other so some but then\n2:59:13\nit's okay I can take a screenshot now one two one two three\n2:59:20\none two three\n2:59:25\noh one more okay one more time one two\n2:59:31\nthree okay great um thank you very much so um I'll see you again in\n2:59:38\n2PM Tokyo time at 2PM Tokyo time so I hope you have a good lunch and I'll see\n2:59:44\nyou soon thank you very much and the second half of the program will be run by Dr Shukla\n2:59:51\nand she would take you through the well-being framework thank you thank you very much thank you all see\n2:59:57\nyou then\n3:00:47\nso maybe we will start yes thank you thank you okay thank you push for giving\n3:00:53\nus great insights into uh the disaster situation around across the globe and the case studies\n3:00:59\nso we now understand what are the challenges with the existing approach to\n3:01:04\npost disaster reconstruction especially with the case studies that uh piyush has\n3:01:10\ndiscussed in the previous session so welcome to session three\n3:01:16\nin which we will try to look into a new theoretical approach uh and why do we\n3:01:22\nneed a new theoretical approach is clearly because of the problems that we are experiencing in the Practical World\n3:01:30\nwhich are actually rooted in the ories that inform our political ideologies as\n3:01:37\nwell as our approach to post disaster restitution and I'll take you through\n3:01:44\nmore detailed discussions during this session given that this is a post lunch\n3:01:50\nsession I'll try not to make it boring and put you to sleep so we will keep interacting in between and please feel\n3:01:57\nfree to unmute yourself and ask any question at any stage you feel like and otherwise we\n3:02:05\nwill have a q a session too it's the end of the session in this session I focus on capability\n3:02:12\napproach as a method which is a theory\n3:02:17\nwhich will give us new insights into the definitions of\n3:02:23\nequality well-being and justice\n3:02:30\nbefore I start I want to quote un RR for acknowledging that we are trapped in a\n3:02:37\nwishes and self-fulfilling cycle of disaster respond recover and repeat\n3:02:45\nthe people hit hardest are those who have done the least to cause these significant changes in terms of disaster\n3:02:55\npeople who are hit the hardest are those who lack resources the most and at the\n3:03:03\nend of disaster they are left with even less and strategies that focus on\n3:03:10\ngiving back or or addressing losses that are\n3:03:15\nasset-based losses in in if they are approaching if we are approaching uh post-disaster\n3:03:22\nreconstruction and compensation based on our understanding of asset-based losses\n3:03:28\nthen clearly we are disadvantaging those who already had less\n3:03:34\nso what is the problem with the theories uh what theories underpin our approach to post-disaster\n3:03:41\nrestitution how do we Define disaster how do we Define restitution and how do\n3:03:48\nwe Define compensation in a theoretical perspective is what we will discuss\n3:03:53\nso the traditional theories of distributive and corrective Justice\n3:03:59\nusually underpin our traditional contemporary approach to disaster management\n3:04:06\nthe most obvious problems which\n3:04:11\nthese approaches experience is that we inherit systematic and institutional\n3:04:19\nproblems consequential to which inequalities and\n3:04:24\nvulnerabilities of the disadvantaged members are also inherited\n3:04:29\nthese inequalities or vulnerabilities can be in the\n3:04:34\ncontext physical context physical vulnerabilities for example\n3:04:40\nin case of tsunami and floods people who are affected the most are those living in low-lying areas or\n3:04:46\nflood-prone areas which are otherwise either not available for development or\n3:04:53\nor cheaply available for occupation like property values and flood-grown areas\n3:04:59\nwill definitely be less in terms of social vulnerability people who are disadvantaged low in the\n3:05:06\nhierarchy and are vulnerable in terms of their income status or caste status in\n3:05:12\nuh here are in in stratified societies are the ones who are disadvantaged as I\n3:05:18\nsaid they are the ones who already have less resources and post-disaster we in they inherit the resource\n3:05:27\ndeprivation because of the approach we adopt to compensation in restitution\n3:05:33\nthis leads to the second problem which means concentration of investment in\n3:05:40\nwealthier households and geographical areas because if our approaches is to\n3:05:46\ncompensate the region or to compensate the household for the assets they have\n3:05:51\nlost then we it means that we will compensate wealthier households and wealthier\n3:05:57\ngeographies better as opposed to poor households and poor riches\n3:06:03\nthis is happening because we are not really focusing on economic contribution to human well-being\n3:06:10\nthis is not to say that economic contribution or monetary contribution to human well-being is any less\n3:06:17\nbut at the same time we can't Overlook other aspects or other dimensions of\n3:06:24\nwell-being such as social capital and health I have used the term distributive and\n3:06:31\ncorrective Justice here and I'll get to that in a little bit but\n3:06:36\nbroadly speaking uh given that we are borrowing our\n3:06:42\ntheoretical ideologies from these theories it is not the problem with the theory\n3:06:47\nitself it is the problem with which we are interpreting these theories that have led to these problems\n3:06:54\nand therefore there is a need for a more robust theoretical framework that can\n3:07:00\ninform the design of a comprehensive and resilient restitution and compensation\n3:07:07\nmechanism now there are three jargons here first the distributive and corrective Justice\n3:07:13\nthe theory of distributive and corrective Justice itself as well as how\n3:07:18\ndo what do we mean by comprehensive and resilient restitution and compensation mechanism so I'll address each of these\n3:07:27\nConcepts as we move forward first things first\n3:07:33\nhow do distributive justice theories and corrective Justice theories inform our\n3:07:39\napproach to post-disaster reconstruction and compensation\n3:07:45\nit will be it is interesting let's first discuss about corrective Justice which\n3:07:51\nmeans losses and benefits are caused by a wrongful Act of a private Doer\n3:07:58\nlet's take an example of some disasters which were caused by private tours the September 11 attack on the World\n3:08:05\nTrade Center we know it was a human agency that caused that\n3:08:11\ndisaster corrective Justice requires compensation\n3:08:16\nto be paid by the Doer now in that case\n3:08:22\nthe agency even though is a human agency can't be held\n3:08:29\nuh risk I mean we cannot get hold of that human agency to fix the problem\n3:08:36\nbecause the intention was to cause the problem and it's hard to get hold of that agency to fix the problem\n3:08:43\nso what do we do then if we are relying on corrective Justice another example a more optimistic\n3:08:49\nexample is probably the triple disaster in Japan in which the nuclear meltdown tsunami\n3:08:57\nand earthquake were the three causes of the disaster to a great extent tepco was penalized\n3:09:05\nfor for the wrongdoing of the nuclear meltdown and corrective Justice could be applied\n3:09:13\nin that case where a private doer was responsible for the for the losses to a\n3:09:22\ncertain extent now what do we do when a natural agency is responsible\n3:09:28\nrather than a human agency let's flag post that question and\n3:09:35\nfirst understand what is distributive justice\n3:09:40\nnow let's say instead of a private tour the entire Society is responsible for\n3:09:46\nthat disaster for example a dam breaking off or or\n3:09:55\na building uh faulty construction because of faulty construction a\n3:10:00\nbuilding coming down so if the society is responsible for those and not just a\n3:10:07\nprivate group or a private agency then how do we distribute the losses and\n3:10:14\nbenefits so distributive justice broadly speaking would mean losses and benefits caused by\n3:10:22\nsocial risk or those to be born by the society\n3:10:27\nnow these definitions are important in defining\n3:10:33\ndisaster itself and I'll take you through how how the\n3:10:38\ndefinition of disaster has changed over time to shift the focus from agent being\n3:10:46\na natural agent to the society as a whole as the agent for causing the\n3:10:54\ndisasters\n3:10:59\nso the classical approach to the definition of disaster\n3:11:04\nhas been based on two things first the agency that causes\n3:11:10\nthe disaster and second what is the impact of that\n3:11:16\naction in the classical approach or back in time we as a society\n3:11:24\nconcluded that disaster is an event Beyond human control\n3:11:30\nwhich has an impact on social functionings which leads to failure of\n3:11:35\nthe social system to deliver responsible conditions of life\n3:11:40\nnow as we have progressed further to be a more modern and more thoughtful\n3:11:46\nSociety we have realized that uh\n3:11:53\nit's all disaster is actually caused by human agency even though it is rooted in\n3:12:00\nthe nature but the impact of disaster on the society happens only because of the\n3:12:08\nactions and lack of actions of the human agency or the society\n3:12:15\nthe disruption and vulnerability are the characteristics of the social system and\n3:12:20\nnot the natural system as uh sakshi was asking earlier what can\n3:12:26\nwe do to remove to to overcome the problem of frequent flooding so frequent\n3:12:31\nflooding is a natural phenomena but being vulnerable to it\n3:12:37\nis is something that humans can get over with\n3:12:42\nby adopting mitigation strategies by choosing locations that are less blood\n3:12:48\nprone or occasional seasonal evacuations uh proactive evacuations Etc so whether\n3:12:56\nas a group as a society we are vulnerable to it and whether we let natural causes\n3:13:02\ncause disruption to the social system is a matter of our human actions as a group\n3:13:08\nas a society as a collective and therefore the modern approach has shifted the definition of disaster\n3:13:17\nfocused on natural agent to the focus on human as the agency of disaster\n3:13:26\nanyone has any thoughts about it\n3:13:33\nor are we all agreeing to it\n3:13:43\nso I assume that we understand and we are agreeing to the modern approach\n3:13:50\nwhich holds human agencies as responsible for disaster and therefore\n3:13:57\nthe onus of compensation and restitution also lies on the society as a group\n3:14:05\nand we are not doing enough to take that responsibility on board\n3:14:11\nbecause it is only recently that theoretically we have started acknowledging the society as the agency\n3:14:19\nof disaster and if we are not if we were not acknowledging that and we were rather uh\n3:14:26\nassuming it to be a natural agency as the responsible Agency for\n3:14:32\ncausing disaster then we were in a way not holding ourselves responsible as a\n3:14:39\ngroup to compensate and restitute for natural disasters and therefore whatever was\n3:14:45\ndone uh to compensate disaster-affected segment of the society was seen as a\n3:14:51\nwelfare contribution rather than as a rightful compensation so when the affected members of the\n3:14:59\nsociety are more rightful about regaining the normal normalcy or the\n3:15:07\nstate of being normal as before disaster the more rightful we\n3:15:12\nwill consider them and we will acknowledge them as rightful members of the society for compensation and\n3:15:19\nrestitution the more will be done to to make it happen\n3:15:26\nthe definition of disaster I take the discussion forward to First quote uh uni\n3:15:33\nSDS definition and then acknowledge the role of capability approach in\n3:15:40\nredefining disaster so uni isdr says that a serious\n3:15:46\ndisruption to the functioning of a community or a society involving\n3:15:52\nwidespread human material economic or environmental losses and impacts which\n3:15:58\nexceed the ability of the affected Community or Society to cope using its\n3:16:04\nown resources there are quite a few things to notice here first the use of the term functioning\n3:16:12\nalthough it is not used in the context of capability\n3:16:17\napproach rather in a more General meaning of functioning of a society or a\n3:16:22\ncommunity and yet we can actually translate this definition to relate it\n3:16:27\nto the capability Theory and I'll come to that in a while second thing to notice here is that the\n3:16:36\nacknowledgment of the damage to be wide enough or big enough to exceed beyond\n3:16:43\nthe ability of the affected community to cope with it which means that uh\n3:16:50\nhealth and assistance from external agencies will be required as we as we\n3:16:56\noften observe in the capab in the context of capability approach or capability Theory\n3:17:04\nwe can redefine disaster as a process through which deprivation of\n3:17:12\nElementary functionings happens for a large group of people to the extent that\n3:17:19\nsocietal support is needed to reinstate or improve the situation post-disaster\n3:17:27\nhere I'm using the word functioning in the as defined by Professor Ahmad\n3:17:32\nHussein and I'll explain what capability Theory means what functioning means and\n3:17:39\nthen we will come back to look into this definition more closely\n3:17:45\nI also use the term comprehensive and resilient restitution\n3:17:51\nand compensation mechanism I will again Define what it means in the\n3:17:57\ncontext of capability Theory and then again we will come back to this to understand it better once we have\n3:18:04\ndiscussed what capability theory is and what functionings mean\n3:18:09\nSo based on the capability Theory we can say that a comprehensive approach to\n3:18:15\npost-disaster restitution and compensation would entail two things at\n3:18:21\nleast firstly as per the principle of equivalence of compensation which means why should we\n3:18:29\ncompensated well enough to be put back to the same situation as before disaster\n3:18:35\nas per this principle of equivalence the affected people are put back in the same\n3:18:42\nstate or a better State as before disaster\n3:18:47\nand how do we do this is through a satisfactory reconstruction of all\n3:18:54\noriginal functionings which people had access to or by replacing those\n3:18:59\nfunctionings were equally valuable or better functionings and the second thing a comprehensive and\n3:19:06\nresilient mechanism would entail and as per the build back better concept\n3:19:15\nis to overcome free disaster functioning deprivation and harness functionings\n3:19:22\nwhich improve the resilience towards disaster and overall well-being\n3:19:28\nlots of jargons here and we will decipher H as we move forward in today's\n3:19:33\ndiscussion this is to uh\n3:19:39\nbasically in induce some curiosity in you to understand and ask questions about\n3:19:47\ncapability Theory these are the obvious questions coming to your mind\n3:19:53\nwhat is capability Theory what is functioning what are Elementary functionings we are\n3:19:59\ntalking about to be reinstalled post disaster\n3:20:05\nlet's try to clear our mind and go back in time when we were still\n3:20:11\nevolving as a society and there were lots of great minds\n3:20:16\nphilosophers and theoreticians who were designing the principles for the social\n3:20:22\nlegal political institutions which we today experience in their most\n3:20:29\nrefined form although constantly evolving so most of these\n3:20:36\ninstitutions were resting on the principles that were Guided by four\n3:20:43\ncardinal virtues the virtue of Justice courage Temperance\n3:20:49\nand prudence now courage Temperance and prudence\n3:20:57\ncan be inculcated in an individual as a person as a human being\n3:21:04\nif I am more courageous if I'm more courageous\n3:21:10\nit's not coming at the cost of anyone else's courage I can be as courageous as\n3:21:15\nI want to be without compromising on Courage of anyone else if I want to be prudent\n3:21:22\nsame way I'm not compromising anyone else's prudence but when it comes to Justice\n3:21:29\nbeing more just to one can mean being less just to others\n3:21:35\nand therefore the distribution of Justice is very important\n3:21:41\nprinciple for all our institutions the political\n3:21:46\nlegal social moral institutions to operate the virtue of justice has therefore\n3:21:53\ngained a lot of attention from all the theoreticians and philosophers and in in\n3:21:59\nhis book on a theory of Justice John Ross says that Justice is the first\n3:22:04\nvirtue of social institutions we want Justice to be distributed\n3:22:10\nequally and therefore many theories of Justice explain\n3:22:16\nhow Justice should be distributed equally within the broader theoretical Paradigm\n3:22:23\nof theories of distributive justice lies economic Justice which essentially\n3:22:30\nfocuses on just distribution of resources such as land\n3:22:36\nassets and other form of resources now where does the capability Theory fit\n3:22:43\nin and why are we talking about all this get coming back to the discussion on\n3:22:50\nJustice and how Justice should be distributed there are three at least\n3:22:58\nmainstream theories of distributive justice that have been debated and discussed a lot of which the theory of\n3:23:05\nutilitarian distributive justice is most popularly accepted in the contemporary\n3:23:13\nsociety and most of the work that we uh\n3:23:19\nC and most of our policies are Guided by the utilitarian Theory if there is a problem with the\n3:23:25\nutilitarian theory that means there is problem with all the policies plans regulations laws that we are following\n3:23:33\nso let's understand what is utilitarian Theory and how is capability theory\n3:23:38\ndifferent and whether there is any currency in questioning the utilitarian\n3:23:44\nTheory and adopting from other theories of distributive justice so that we can\n3:23:50\nbe a little bit more holistic in our approach to post the disaster\n3:23:55\nrestitution and compensation so as a theory of Justice\n3:24:00\nutilitarianism says that we should try\n3:24:07\nto distribute happiness equally across all members of the\n3:24:13\nsociety fair enough utility here means\n3:24:19\nhappiness now the bigger question is how do we define happiness\n3:24:25\nI'll flag that question and we'll come to that we will answer that question in a while but let's broadly try to\n3:24:31\nunderstand other parallel theories of justice and what were their\n3:24:38\narguments what kind of equality were they trying to achieve or and what how are they aiming\n3:24:47\nto achieve distributive justice for example libertarianisms and egalitarianisms\n3:24:55\ndebated that equality of Liberty is important\n3:25:03\nequality in some other dimensions are also important and how capability theory is different\n3:25:10\nfrom utilitarianism libertarianism and other such theories is that it argues\n3:25:17\nfor equality of capability and functionings Professor amartisan argues that all\n3:25:26\nthese theories of distributive justice argue for equality although in different\n3:25:32\ndimensions for example utility utilitarianism argues for equality of\n3:25:38\nutility and libertarianism argues for equality of Liberty of each individual\n3:25:45\nand sane argues slightly differently for equality of capability and functionings\n3:25:51\nend objective is same to be just to all members of the society\n3:25:56\nnow what is the problem with utilitarianism there are obviously\n3:26:02\nextensive literature available on uh the theory of utilitarianism\n3:26:08\nlibertarianism and egalitarianism and uh Cross or counter argument for each so\n3:26:15\nI'll not get into the details of it but we are broadly touching on utilitarianism given that it informs\n3:26:21\nmost of our uh policies and practices in the Contemporary Society\n3:26:28\nnow if we are trying to achieve Equal justice and equal well-being for every\n3:26:33\nindividual then utilitarian utilitarian approach\n3:26:39\nhas its own limitations we will try to look into how utilitarianism\n3:26:45\napproaches Justice and well-being what is its limitation then we will progress\n3:26:51\ninto looking at capability approach and to well-being and we will then talk about\n3:26:58\nwhat kind of capabilities are crucial to a decent quality of human life\n3:27:05\nas argued by Martha's mom and how do we achieve that\n3:27:13\nfocusing on the utilitarian approach to well-being it says that human well-being\n3:27:20\nis equal to happiness and utility so everyone having equal\n3:27:25\nlevel of happiness guarantees that everyone has equal well-being\n3:27:31\nand therefore we meet the objective of being a just Society\n3:27:37\nnow to simplify utilitarian theory has been oversimplified in some ways to equate\n3:27:45\nhappiness and pleasure to income and resources it's kind of logical because if we\n3:27:53\nassume that income and research having access to income and resources means we\n3:28:01\ncan translate the income and resources to to any useful thing that we want to\n3:28:10\nachieve but then what is the problem to that\n3:28:17\nequating happiness to\n3:28:23\nincome means we are omitting the happiness generated by non-income or non-resource\n3:28:31\nbased uh mechanisms for example\n3:28:38\nhaving a family it's not a resource it's not income but living alone as opposed to living with a\n3:28:45\nfamily is not doesn't make anyone happy and it has been proven in in the psychology\n3:28:51\nresearch it does impact upon one's psychological well-being living with family and friends has a good impact on\n3:28:58\nsomeone's happiness but as per the utilitarian Theory if we equate happiness to income and\n3:29:05\nresources then we are ignoring and overlooking those non-in non-income generating utilities\n3:29:14\nthere is another example here this is more related to the kind of\n3:29:21\ndiscussions we are having which is on losses losses caused by disasters\n3:29:27\nlet's say there is Mr X who is a big farmer and the square here represents 16\n3:29:35\nhectare of land that is owned by Mr X on the other hand there is Mr y who is a\n3:29:42\nvery small farmer he owns only one hectare of land let's say for some government purpose\n3:29:49\nsay for example building a hospital one hectare of land is required or\n3:29:56\nrather two hectare land is required the government acquires one hectare of\n3:30:01\nland from Mr X and one hectare land of Mr y\n3:30:06\nnow as per the utilitarian approach both of them have\n3:30:11\nlost same amount of resource which is one hectare of land\n3:30:17\nand therefore both of them should receive same level of compensation which is the monetary value of one hectare of\n3:30:24\nland do you agree that this will be a fair compensation\n3:30:29\nfor Mr X and Mr y\n3:30:35\nanyone would like to comment on this\n3:30:41\nthe question is that if we acquire one hectare of land from a big farmer who owns 16 hectare\n3:30:49\nas opposed to acquiring one hectare of land from a small farmer who only owns one hectare\n3:30:57\ndo both of them have same set of losses and if we pay\n3:31:04\nthe same amount for the value of land to both of them does it compensate both of them fairly\n3:31:10\nfor all the losses\n3:31:18\nhow many of you may be just by typing yes or no in the chat window\n3:31:23\nhow many of you agree that payment of market value of land\n3:31:29\nsay hundred dollars to each is fair compensation for each\n3:31:34\nhow many of you agree you can type yes or no\n3:31:55\nokay I'm receiving responses\n3:32:05\nlet's see well most of us think\n3:32:10\nit's not fair that we pay same amount of money to both would anyone like to expand why\n3:32:22\nwhy do you think it is not fair\n3:32:29\nmaybe I'll try to help you here\n3:32:34\nMr X in case of Mr X Mr X is losing definitely the income he was generating\n3:32:40\nfrom using or cropping on that land but Mr y who owns only one hectare of\n3:32:47\nland was probably also losing the security of food and employment security of that one\n3:32:53\nhectare of land is taken away there might be many other things for which Mr y was dependent on this land let's say\n3:33:00\nhe was residing on this land then he may also be losing shelter security Etc\n3:33:06\nso that means utilitarian approach\n3:33:12\ndoesn't allow us to explain the difference between losses of Mr X and Y\n3:33:18\nbecause as per the utilitarian approach both of them have lost equal amount of resource which is one hectare of land\n3:33:26\nand therefore both of them should be paid the same amount of compensation and that is what we are doing as a modern\n3:33:32\nsociety we are paying everyone as per the resource they lose and we don't look\n3:33:38\nat the other functions which people extract from those resources\n3:33:44\nso we need a theory that can explain logically and rationally\n3:33:49\nwhat is the nature of loss that people undergo when disastrous happen\n3:33:56\nit's not just resource so what is it and how do we compensate them fairly\n3:34:01\nbecause to be able to compensate them fairly we need to understand first the\n3:34:06\ncomprehensive definition of loss and that's what why we need theories\n3:34:13\nthat can comprehensively explain it and utilitarian approach is not proving\n3:34:18\nadequate in US let's take another example now we are trying to understand\n3:34:24\nhow people use resources what do they extract from them again taking example of Mr X who has\n3:34:33\ndone farming and wants to return home so on the first day Mr X returns home\n3:34:39\nwalking and after reaching home he generates happiness of say one emoji\n3:34:47\nwe we are measuring here happiness using emojis because irrespective of how and how much Advance\n3:34:54\nwe have become we still can't measure happiness on the second day\n3:35:02\nMr X thought he will buy a bicycle which is a resource\n3:35:07\nand after finishing his work in the fields he decides to ride back home he\n3:35:14\nsaves time he enjoyed the weather while riding back home and in doing so his happiness doubled\n3:35:23\nfair enough here having a resource which is a bicycle added or doubled the happiness\n3:35:29\nof Mr X on the contrary Mr wise physically disabled\n3:35:36\nif we give the same resource to Mr y his happiness remains unchanged because\n3:35:42\nMr y cannot convert this resource any into any useful function for himself\n3:35:50\nso what does this mean this means that the ability to convert\n3:35:55\nthe characteristics of a commodity into Personal Achievement in this case\n3:36:03\nbicycling being the Personal Achievement it depends on a variety of factors\n3:36:09\nincluding the personal characteristics of the person as well as the social\n3:36:15\nArrangements in which they operate\n3:36:20\nthis is a very uh deep meaning statement it tells us\n3:36:26\nthe importance of three things at the same time which are necessary\n3:36:31\nfor happiness of an individual first access to resource\n3:36:38\nfor access to Resource One does need income and\n3:36:43\nwe are not undermining the importance of income and resources as\n3:36:50\nuh has been emphasized by the utilitarian theory\n3:36:55\nthat importance remains in place what we are saying is that is only one of the\n3:37:01\nelements necessary for in happiness generation the other two are the\n3:37:06\npersonal characteristics of an individual to be able to use that resource and to put it in into some\n3:37:13\nmeaningful use for himself or herself so the personal characteristic to\n3:37:19\nconvert that resource into usefulness is important I want to emphasize on the social\n3:37:26\nArrangements in which a person operates or the institutional environment around\n3:37:32\nthem in which they operate which is also necessary together with the personal\n3:37:38\ncharacteristic and resource for the conversion of resource into anything useful\n3:37:44\nI'll take another interesting example to explain the importance of the social Arrangement or institutions\n\nThis is the continue parts from previous. Can you summarize it too?",

      "content": "The discussion continues to address challenges in post-disaster reconstruction, particularly focusing on the Philippines and Japan. The key issues include:\n\n1. **Preparedness and Reconstruction Challenges**: There's a need for better infrastructure and coordinated aid to address the slow and inefficient response in disaster situations. For instance, the Philippines faced significant challenges during Typhoon Haiyan, with many families left without sufficient aid or proper housing due to a lack of coordination among the numerous involved organizations.\n\n2. **Issues with Transitional Shelters**: Transitional shelters were often criticized for being an unnecessary expense and for creating additional hardships, especially for women, due to inadequate facilities like bathrooms and water supply.\n\n3. **Housing Reconstruction**: Different approaches, such as repair and retrofitting, core shelter construction, and resettlement, were discussed. Issues included the use of inadequate materials, lack of livelihood opportunities in resettlement areas, and cultural mismatches in provided housing solutions.\n\n4. **Livelihood Considerations**: The importance of considering livelihoods in reconstruction efforts was emphasized. For example, some fishermen preferred staying in flood-prone areas due to livelihood necessities despite being offered safer housing elsewhere.\n\n5. **Coordination and Resources**: The lack of a unified approach and the need for better coordination among aid organizations were highlighted, along with the challenges of securing funding and resources.\n\n6. **Theoretical Frameworks**: The need for a new theoretical framework for post-disaster reconstruction was proposed, one that goes beyond traditional distributive and corrective justice theories. This framework should consider the broader aspects of well-being and capabilities, as discussed in the capability approach.\n\n7. **Capability Approach**: This theory, proposed by Amartya Sen, emphasizes the importance of not only economic resources but also the ability of individuals to convert these resources into valuable functionings. The approach suggests that policies should focus on enhancing people's capabilities to live the lives they value, rather than merely compensating for economic losses.\n\n8. **Utilitarianism Critique**: The limitations of utilitarianism, which focuses on maximizing overall happiness often measured in terms of economic gains, were discussed. It was argued that this approach does not adequately address the complexities of individual well-being, particularly the non-economic aspects.\n\n9. **Comprehensive and Resilient Mechanisms**: The need for reconstruction policies that not only restore the previous state of well-being but also improve resilience and overall well-being post-disaster was emphasized.\n\n10. **Practical Implementation**: The discussion included practical examples and challenges in implementing these theoretical approaches in real-world disaster recovery scenarios, highlighting the gaps between theory and practice.\n\nOverall, the session stressed the importance of considering a broader range of factors in post-disaster reconstruction, including social, economic, and cultural aspects, to create more resilient and equitable recovery processes.",

      "content": "\n3:37:53\nthis is the poster of a Bollywood movie called dangal dangal means wrestling\n3:38:01\nthis movie was based on the personal life story of India's first female\n3:38:07\nfreestyle wrestler who brought gold in the Commonwealth Games in India uh in\n3:38:16\n2010 for the first time so a female wrestler from India was winning a gold\n3:38:21\nmedal in the Commonwealth Games in 2010 for the first time she is called Gita phogat\n3:38:28\na forgot was the elder daughter of another wrestler mahavir fogart\n3:38:36\nmahavir forgot comes from a very patriarchal society in the state of haryana\n3:38:43\nwhere women are not seen as equal let alone in wrestling\n3:38:49\nmahavir fogart had the Sleep urge that he wants his child to be a wrestler and\n3:38:56\nfor many years he regretted for having a girl child both of his kids were girl\n3:39:02\nchildren One Fine Day mahavir realized that irrespective of the fact that he has\n3:39:09\ngirl children he wants to make them into good wrestlers because he was a very good wrestler himself and he wanted to pass\n3:39:17\non that skill and he was trusting the the genes he was carrying as a wrestler\n3:39:23\nso he started training his daughter as a wrestler in a male dominating Society there was\n3:39:30\nno no arrangement for a female to either\n3:39:35\nlearn wrestling or to practice wrestling so it happens so that Gita forgot was\n3:39:41\nwrestling against men and that made her a very strong solid\n3:39:47\ncontestant however it also meant for both Kita\n3:39:52\nphogat and her father mahavir to to fight against society and social\n3:39:58\nstereotype and Norms where women were not seen and not encouraged as wrestlers\n3:40:05\nthey they found success by overcoming these social barriers institutional barriers and\n3:40:12\nsocial norms and and made their way to a gold medal for India the first code gold\n3:40:19\nmedal won by a female wrestler so that is where in this case Gita forgot had the personal characteristics\n3:40:26\nshe had resources although limited but still she had resources probably uh same\n3:40:33\nto what other contestants or other wrestlers in haryana had however the social Arrangements in which\n3:40:40\nshe was operating were very different for a male wrestler as opposed to a female wrestler but they overcame that\n3:40:48\nand achieved success in wrestling so this is what\n3:40:54\nthese three things the personal characteristic resources and the so the institutional environment and social\n3:41:00\nenvironment put together leads to conversion of resources into\n3:41:05\nhappiness and these elements these three elements are\n3:41:11\ndifferent for each individual and therefore same resource can translate\n3:41:16\ninto different level of achievements for different individuals\n3:41:25\nnow how do we Define functioning and capability after hearing all this\n3:41:31\nto give a simple example of functioning being able to Bicycle being able to\n3:41:36\nwrestle are the states of being being able to do or to be being able to be a\n3:41:44\nwrestler being able to do bicycling these are these states of being or doing\n3:41:51\nis what is saying calls as functionings we all want to achieve certain\n3:41:58\nfunctionings by putting resources to use it's not the bicycle itself that one\n3:42:05\nwants to acquire it's the state of being able to Bicycle that one pleasure takes pleasure in\n3:42:13\nso functioning is this state of being or doing for example some of the very Elementary functionings necessary for\n3:42:21\nhuman survival is being adequately nourished or being in good health\n3:42:28\nsome of the more complex functionings can be achieving self-respect\n3:42:36\nbeing socially integrated\n3:42:41\nbeing a wrestler for Gita for God was a\n3:42:46\ncomplex functioning to achieve now what amartisan says is that\n3:42:54\nthe set of functionings that an individual has access to should\n3:42:59\nbe wide as wide as possible The Wider the set of functionings\n3:43:06\nthe more is your well-being because a wide set of functionings means one has\n3:43:13\naccess to resources one has excess or one is operating in an Institutional\n3:43:19\nenvironment that allows the conversion of those resources into those functionings and second thirdly\n3:43:26\none has the personal characteristic to convert those resources into functionings so why do the set of\n3:43:33\nfunctionings bigger is your well-being because\n3:43:38\nThe Wider the set of functioning the more is your ability or capability to\n3:43:43\nchoose from a wide range of options that then contribute to your well-being for\n3:43:50\nexample if I'm a monk\n3:43:55\nas opposed to a poor person both me and a poor person have the\n3:44:02\nX's to food but very minimalistic food the difference between the two is that\n3:44:09\nas a monk one has the choice to eat more or eat less\n3:44:15\nbut as a poor person one doesn't have that second option of eating adequate\n3:44:21\nand therefore choosing to starve or not having adequate food or not in taking\n3:44:27\nadequate food is a matter of choice for the Monk but\n3:44:33\nthe monk had a wider excess or had it has access to a wider set of functioning\n3:44:38\nswitches to stuff or to eat adequate but the poor person has only one functioning\n3:44:43\noption available which is to starve and therefore the set of functionings\n3:44:49\nThe Wider the set of functionings to choose from translate into our happiness\n3:44:56\nand this requires accessory resources having personal characteristics that allow the conversion of resources into\n3:45:02\nfunctioning and operating in institutional environment that allows conversion of those resources into and\n3:45:08\nachievements so capability is the chosen set of functioning in the case of Monk\n3:45:14\nand the poor person if both of them choose to stop then that defines their\n3:45:20\ncapability if the monk chooses to be well nourished that defines his capability as opposed to staff which is\n3:45:27\nthe which is the only option for the poor person so being well or having a larger\n3:45:34\nor bigger well-being means having large set of functionings too choose from\n3:45:44\nnow what happens is that there can't can be no limit to the extent of\n3:45:50\nfunctionings one wants X's to as an individual I can be very greedy\n3:45:55\nand I want exes too every functioning that I can list fair enough but does it mean\n3:46:02\nthe society is responsible to provide access to all the functionings where do we draw the line between social\n3:46:09\nresponsibility to provide functionings and individuals\n3:46:15\nresponsibility to access those functionings when it comes to some of the elementary\n3:46:20\nfunctionings or let's compare it with human rights basic human rights for example food\n3:46:27\nsecurity shelter security security against physical harm Etc these could be some of those\n3:46:33\nElementary functionings to which everyone should have access to so while sane does not employ an\n3:46:41\nelementary list of functionings necessary for a decent quality of life marthana's bomb does propose 10 Central\n3:46:49\ncapabilities which she argues are required for a decent Quality of Life by each\n3:46:57\nindividual and she argues that the government has the job of making people able to pursue\n3:47:03\na dignified and minimally flourishing life and they should uh be granted access to\n3:47:12\nat least these 10 Central human capabilities as she calls it\n3:47:19\nwhat are these 10 Central human capabilities the first one is\n3:47:27\nlife which means being able to live to the end of a human life of normal length\n3:47:36\nnot dying prematurely or before once life is so reduced as to be not worth\n3:47:44\nliving for example\n3:47:52\nfemale feticide is a is a death of a child in the womb before\n3:47:58\nshe is born and as for matana's bombs argument that\n3:48:05\nis something to which everyone should have that is something that should not\n3:48:10\nhappen because everyone should have access to a normal length of Life once they have the life they should have\n3:48:16\naccess to a normal length of life bodily Health being able to have good\n3:48:22\nhealth including reproductive health to be adequately nourished to have\n3:48:28\nadequate shelter for Health it is important that we have adequate nutrition and for Health it is\n3:48:35\nalso important that we have adequate shelter we are also noticing that in\n3:48:41\nsaying so we are acknowledging some necessary resources for example food and\n3:48:48\nshelter are resources which are necessary to generate the capability of bodily Health these resources may also\n3:48:55\nbe required to generate other capabilities listed here so\n3:49:00\none resource can contribute to a to different set of capabilities and there\n3:49:07\ncan be overlaps for example bodily Integrity which means\n3:49:12\nbeing able to move freely from place to place to be secure against violent assault including sexual assault and\n3:49:19\ndomestic violence having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice\n3:49:24\nin matters of reproduction for for this sense of physical safety\n3:49:31\nwhile a crime-free environment is necessary around every individual at the same time\n3:49:38\nhaving access to a secure shelter is also important for physical safety\n3:49:44\nagainst violence Etc so the the access to adequate shelter can also be a\n3:49:50\nprerequisite to bodily Integrity in some cases having senseless imagination and thought\n3:49:58\nwhich means being able to use the human senses being able to imagine think and\n3:50:04\nreason and to do these things in a truly human way a way informed and cultivated by an\n3:50:13\nadequate education including but by no means limited to literacy and basic\n3:50:19\nmathematical and scientific training here in saying so martana's bomb is\n3:50:25\nacknowledging the importance of education but at the same time she is also emphasizing that being able to\n3:50:31\nimagine and think doesn't necessarily only depend on education and literacy it\n3:50:36\nneeds more than that having senseless imagination and thought also means being able to use imagination\n3:50:43\nand thought in connection with experiencing and producing works and events of one's own\n3:50:51\nchoice religious literally Musical and so forth\n3:50:57\nthose who are aware of Maslow's uh Theory May relate it to the\n3:51:03\nself-actualization needs of individuals we all want to actualize ourselves by\n3:51:09\nexploring those those reproductive sorry productive and\n3:51:14\nInnovative side of us where we enjoy some religious discussions discussions\n3:51:20\nor pursue music and art pursue poetry Etc so being able to imagine and think\n3:51:27\ninnovatively is also crucial to a decent quality of life\n3:51:32\nemotions which is being able to have attachment to things and people\n3:51:38\noutside of ourselves to love those who love and care for us\n3:51:44\nto grieve at their absence broadly speaking generally to be able to\n3:51:50\nlove to grieve to experience longing gratitude and Justified anger\n3:51:57\nnot having one's emotional development blighted by fear and anxiety\n3:52:03\nso this also means having an emotional support system around us this emotional support system\n3:52:10\nwhich allows us to express our emotions freely and without fear and anxiety\n3:52:16\nthis can come from a protective safe environment within the family within the\n3:52:22\nneighborhood and at a city and Country level as well\n3:52:28\npractical reason is another Central capability that nurse bomb has identified which means being able to\n3:52:34\nform a conception of the good and to engage in critical reflection\n3:52:41\nabout the planning of one's life affiliation needs these are again I'm\n3:52:48\nrelating it to Maslow's hierarchy whereas affiliation has been acknowledged as one of the uh\n3:52:57\nhuman needs here affiliation by affiliation nurse bomb means two things\n3:53:02\none being able to live with and towards others to recognize and show concern for other\n3:53:10\nhuman beings to engage in various forms of social interactions and to be able to imagine\n3:53:17\nthe situation of another during covet all of us were isolating at\n3:53:24\nsome stage and we understand how important it was for us to to have those\n3:53:29\nsocial interactions that was probably the first time when most in Social person would have also\n3:53:36\nrealized the need for social interaction and these are our affiliation needs which nasbaum acknowledges as one of the\n3:53:44\ncentral human capability another interpretation of affiliation is having\n3:53:50\nsocial basis for self-respect and non-humilation\n3:53:55\nbeing able to be treated as a dignified being whose worth is equal to that of others this indirectly also condemns\n3:54:04\ndiscrimination based on gender caste income Etc because it deprives the other\n3:54:11\nperson of many other things include including their self-affiliation needs\n3:54:18\nanother Central human capability identified by nurse bomb is other species which means being able to\n3:54:26\nlive with concern for and in relation to animals plants and the World of Nature\n3:54:33\nthe more we are damaging the environment natural environment around us the more\n3:54:39\nwe are realizing the importance of it not only for our own well-being but also\n3:54:44\nfor the well-being of the ecosystem as a whole and other species as well\n3:54:50\nso our association and relationship with animals plants and the world of nature\n3:54:55\nis not dead yet we are still natural creatures and it is important for our\n3:55:01\noverall well-being that we stay in touch with nature and we protect it for our\n3:55:07\nown well-being as well play being able to laugh to play and to\n3:55:12\nenjoy recreational activities is very crucial for our own well-being and not not not uh confusing it with play of\n3:55:22\nchildren that is important to them for sure but play doesn't only mean playing\n3:55:27\nin the field with kids but regular healthy Sports and being able to laugh\n3:55:33\nin in a normal way and being able to play and to enjoy recreational activities is crucial to to the overall\n3:55:40\nwell-being having control over one's environment again there are two broad interpretation\n3:55:47\nof these capabilities and I'll why I'm explaining all these is\n3:55:52\nin the session after this I mean as an exercise I would like to discuss with\n3:55:58\nyou what kind of indicators can be used to actually\n3:56:05\nmeasure these capabilities if if at all so control over one's environment\n3:56:11\nmeaning political control and also control over property so\n3:56:16\npolitical control would mean being able to participate effectively in political choices that govern one's life and\n3:56:24\nhaving the right of political participation protections of free speech\n3:56:30\nand Association the second aspect to control over one's\n3:56:35\nenvironment entails being able to hold property and having property rights on\n3:56:40\nan equal basis with others having the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others having the freedom\n3:56:48\nfrom unwarranted search and Caesar in work being able to work as a human being\n3:56:54\nexercising practical reason and entering into meaningful relationship of mutual\n3:56:59\nrecognition with other co-workers\n3:57:06\nnow how does how do these capabilities uh fit in the overall discussion on\n3:57:14\ndisaster is uh sorry apologies about the haziness of this image but what we are trying to\n3:57:21\nmap here is on the left in the Blue Table we have listed the Social Development course or the\n3:57:28\nsdgs and on the right we have the central human capabilities of martana's\n3:57:34\nbomb and we have tried to map the SGD it's sdgs against these Central human\n3:57:41\ncapabilities so in a way we can say that a more comprehensive approach to\n3:57:49\ndevelopment goals would be to look at the central human\n3:57:55\ncapabilities that are necessary for release in quality of life and another way to understand sustain\n3:58:03\nsustainable development goals is that they are a more simplified version of\n3:58:10\nwhat central capabilities are for example if we look at food as a\n3:58:18\nsocial sustainable development goal then food ensures life bodily health\n3:58:24\nso while life and bodily Health are more abstract\n3:58:32\nforms of saying okay we need access to food the sustainable development goals put it\n3:58:39\nsimply for us so that it becomes easy to achieve the the central human capabilities in a way\n3:58:47\nnow as promised I'm coming back to the definition of disaster\n3:58:54\nand I will also come back to the definition of\n3:58:59\ncompensation now since we have understood what capability theory is and what\n3:59:05\nfunctionings mean so again to recapture functioning's main the states of being\n3:59:10\nand doing which are valuable to an individual for example being well nourished being able to Bicycle Etc\n3:59:19\nso defining disaster through capability approach would mean disaster is a\n3:59:24\nphenomena in which the the deprivation of Elementary functionings happens for a\n3:59:32\nlarge group of people to the extent that societal support is needed to reinstate\n3:59:39\nor improve the situation post-disaster why I'm using the term reinstate or\n3:59:46\nimprove here is because at times before disaster people might be deprived of those\n3:59:53\nElementary functionings for example someone who is not having access to adequate food is deprived of Elementary\n4:00:00\nfunctionings of bodily health and nourishment so if before disaster they have the\n4:00:07\ndeprivation already existing then post-disaster we should try to improve it rather than reinstate them to the\n4:00:14\nsame state which is a state of not having adequate food\n4:00:23\nas per the definition of comprehensive approach to restitution and compensation\n4:00:31\nwe discussed two things first to build back better which means\n4:00:37\ngiving back or increasing the capability of people to make them disaster\n4:00:43\nresilient and the first was to put them in the same state as they were before disaster\n4:00:50\nor in a better State than they were before disaster in terms of the\n4:00:55\nfunctionings they had so compensation or Fair compensation and\n4:01:01\nrestitution would mean having access to same or better set of functionings as before disaster\n4:01:08\nthat can come from the same set of resources or different set of resources\n4:01:14\nbut what is important it is to have access to all the Elementary functionings at the least and to have\n4:01:21\naccess to functionings which they had exist before disaster\n4:01:28\nput simply a comprehensive and resilient mechanism of post-disaster restitution\n4:01:35\nand compensation would either reconstruct or replace or\n4:01:43\nadd to the original set of functionings of the affected people in a way that\n4:01:48\ntheir well-being and resilience post-disaster is better\n4:01:57\nthese are some of the references that I have used for for your understanding now\n4:02:03\ndo you have any questions on this session and once I take your questions I\n4:02:10\nhave a access a small exercise that we can do together\n4:02:17\nwhich is to identify indicators for these Central human\n4:02:23\ncapabilities I would request you to uh\n4:02:30\nunmute yourself and if you like also please uh turn on your camera so that we can have\n4:02:38\na little bit of a discussion on how do we measure these capabilities let's say if we want to go ahead with the\n4:02:45\ncapability approach and we want to ensure that after\n4:02:50\ndisaster everyone has access to these Central human capabilities\n4:02:56\nthen what do we do about it how do we measure it in in the short run and long\n4:03:04\nterm I have given some examples here and would also like to invite your critical\n4:03:11\nfeedback on it and to start the discussion maybe let's focus on the capability of\n4:03:20\nlife which means being able to live a normal length of life\n4:03:25\ndo you think uh life expectancy can be a good indicator of of whether this\n4:03:33\nfunctioning or capability is accessible to people\n4:03:39\nwhat is the vulnerability to natural disasters frequency and intensity in that region\n4:03:46\nfidelities any thoughts any views\n4:04:00\num examples of indicators like life\n4:04:06\nexpectancy as a major indicator for life is a great thing\n4:04:11\nso in the disaster context if we have to address life expectancy\n4:04:19\nwhat kind of resources what kind of mechanism that would be required and how contextual it\n4:04:26\nwill be for an individual's characteristics because each individual\n4:04:31\ncharacteristics and ability to convert those resources is different so maybe we can have some discussion\n4:04:38\naround like if we were to restore this as a capability what kind of resources do\n4:04:45\nthey think or what kind of programs do they think would be helpful\n4:04:50\nso you mean like uh life insurance should as an example that\n4:04:57\ncovers disaster related deaths as well yeah I\n4:05:03\nthink it is but the question is that life insurance if it's private then poor can't afford\n4:05:09\nit that's true so that's where we we want to understand uh\n4:05:18\nin that there are two two big questions here I think one\n4:05:24\nwhich of these things can be will require individual level intervention\n4:05:30\nlike putting back together the ability\n4:05:36\nto being able to express emotions\n4:05:42\nEtc will be very individualistic one-on-one discussions will be required there but for example for bodily health\n4:05:52\nit will be it can be a mass Approach at a mass level unless some someone has\n4:05:57\nvery specific nutritional requirements so\n4:06:03\nespecially in a post-disaster situation so where do we draw the line on\n4:06:12\napproaching individ at an individual level and generalizing\n4:06:17\nhow this can be addressed at a societal level\n4:06:31\nwhat do you think about uh please like\n4:06:37\ndo you think we will be yeah Jyoti I think let me uh take those two\n4:06:43\nissues which you mentioned life and bodily health and possibly ask a little in or some other people who have\n4:06:50\nexperience of Philippines particularly in the context of Hainan\n4:06:55\num now if they were to restore these things if they were to ensure\n4:07:02\nthat the bodily health through the nutritional level is an\n4:07:07\nimportant component to restore how would their food program look like\n4:07:15\nand also if they were to look at say life expectancy how would their health\n4:07:21\nprogram look like and the post disaster reconstruction situation\n4:07:40\nokay let me uh probably expand that little more so when we are\n4:07:46\nlooking at nutritional level and let's stay let's take child as a focus\n4:07:51\nso one would expect that between zero to six months a child would be uh dependent\n4:07:58\non mother's breastfeeding from 6 to 23 years old they would have\n4:08:05\nother kind of nutritional food like cereals and protein and all other things and beyond\n4:08:11\nthat they will have much more now the question then arises that in a disaster context where\n4:08:18\nthe food is scarce the challenges of meeting nutritional\n4:08:24\nlevel and and we all know that if a child let's say the Haina the impact of\n4:08:30\nthat was a few years and for the children who are in that age\n4:08:35\nbracket they suffered a lot it would cause stunting it would cause wasting\n4:08:40\nthat would have impact on their later life the question is that\n4:08:46\ndo you think that um programs that were designed they were\n4:08:51\nadequately addressing these issues and if not what could have been done\n4:09:02\nso are you uh maybe we posed this question to uh\n4:09:08\nLegoland I yeah little and would you like to respond to this\n4:09:24\nor maybe uni or Unis from Indonesia and she has the experience of Asian 2004\n4:09:32\ntsunami or maybe Anna anyone would like to\n4:09:38\nrespond please jump in and we'll make this session more lively in that way\n4:09:44\nhello good afternoon at all um my name is Judy um well actually\n4:09:50\nI did not experience by myself uh during the 2004 in rjf the disaster at the time\n4:09:59\nso but but then again uh uh I have questions but actually my\n4:10:04\nfirst question is to Professor tiwari um but then uh but because we still at\n4:10:12\nthis session with uh Dr chioti we need to I'm quite confused actually by the\n4:10:21\num the capability um the one that you mentioned uh I think uh professor tiwari already mentioned\n4:10:28\nearlier with the bodily healthy and with the life expectancy expectancy\n4:10:34\num my question is is is is this two capability is already I mean\n4:10:40\nare prepared by the um my question is actually uh whether\n4:10:48\nthis capability for the nutrition level is already uh\n4:10:55\ncompiled the data before so we don't know whether because during the disaster is actually\n4:11:01\num well professori mentioned that um the the food scars over there so it is\n4:11:11\nthe access to the foods the water and all the basic necessity is very uh hard\n4:11:18\nto find so um the nutrition level it might be during uh after the disaster or post\n4:11:26\ndisaster um there is a the nutrition level for the affected people might be lower than\n4:11:32\nthat but my question is actually uh how do we uh classify the bodily help\n4:11:41\ncompared to the before the disaster happened I mean uh uh what if the\n4:11:50\naffected area is actually based on the nutritional level especially for those uh area that are quite uh far from the\n4:11:59\ncities let's say they're on a village or something like that well it's actually an additional level before the disaster\n4:12:04\nis already uh low and how do we calculate the bodily health\n4:12:11\nand Machine level or the capability after the uh postal disaster so I'm\n4:12:16\nconfused over there\n4:12:27\nresponding okay um I can start with that and I would request you also to chip in so I think\n4:12:33\nuni it's a very good observation so let's say that what do we mean by\n4:12:39\nthese capabilities so by bodily health we mean that whether somebody is able to\n4:12:47\nlive a healthy life now here my observation is is the comparison necessary\n4:12:54\nto uh between before and after disaster or is it that we should be looking at\n4:13:01\nsince we are reconstructing and we are reconstructing support build back better so we should be focusing on that since\n4:13:08\nwe are building back better we should be looking at what should be our approach\n4:13:14\nto building this are we able to um do things that will allow\n4:13:21\nsomeone to uh to be able to have a good health I\n4:13:26\nthink that's the question now you're absolutely right the resources are stressed and resources are\n4:13:33\ndifficult during the disaster time and probably what happens is that the\n4:13:39\ndisaster prolongs for such a long time the effect and impact is not just\n4:13:44\nimmediate when the tsunami is there or when the typhoon is there not for that period but it's prolonged it's for many\n4:13:51\nmany years to come in that many many years some of the stakeholders like children\n4:13:57\nwho would be in that age they would be permanently damaged unless we have a\n4:14:04\ncredible way of focusing on them and Recon constructing\n4:14:09\ntheir this capability so that like they're they're able to be in good health and live a good life\n4:14:15\nso the focus here is not to immediately feed them\n4:14:20\nnot to immediately feed them with rice or cereal or something of that kind the programming should be such that it is\n4:14:27\nholistic and keeps that in perspective that while we are doing this we do it in a way that addresses some of these\n4:14:35\nlonger term well-being gifts capabilities that contribute to the\n4:14:40\nwell-being over to you yeah I think uh uni asked\n4:14:47\nquite a few things in that question uh one was how do we measure these\n4:14:55\nbe it before disaster or after disaster so uni you are very right that while we\n4:15:01\nhave measurable indicators for a few things like for example nutrition can be measured with the among children and\n4:15:08\namong adults nutrition level can be measured and we do have historical data\n4:15:14\non that for many countries we may not be able to measure or we need\n4:15:21\nto find ways to understand whether people have been able to express their\n4:15:26\nemotions and what kind of emotional support they have before disaster after disaster\n4:15:32\nirrespective so what is on how what kind of\n4:15:38\nindicators can be used to ensure that everyone has access to these\n4:15:44\nminimalistic Central capabilities second some of these are are in\n4:15:52\nespecially in a post-disaster situation some of these are to be addressed\n4:15:57\nimmediately and on an urgent basis for example shelter security food security and\n4:16:03\nensuring that people are protected against violence and crime Etc these are to be ensured on an immediate basis\n4:16:10\nsome of these have to be built over time in the short or the long term\n4:16:17\nso post-disaster is an opportunity to build back better but what dimensions\n4:16:23\nneed to be built back better are not only the physical infrastructure and housing the dimensions which are\n4:16:29\nimportant for a decent quality of life also include people's interaction to other species their ability to to have\n4:16:36\nRecreation and not being overworked their ability to to express emotions so\n4:16:42\nhow do we ensure that all these things are in place in the long and short term\n4:16:49\nand not just the fulfilling the immediate needs and building back better\n4:16:54\nin terms of physical infrastructure only so does it make sense\n4:17:03\num so you mean the one that you present uh represented\n4:17:08\nis actually for more like um like a midterm yeah a midterm Target\n4:17:15\nor um this is that we need to achieve um maybe it's not on the short term but\n4:17:21\nthere's more like a long term something like that right\n4:17:27\nyes yeah we can say that this is our\n4:17:34\nobjective as a society we want to achieve this for everyone\n4:17:39\nnow in a post-disaster situation some of these become very endangered and we want\n4:17:45\nto address it very quickly but uh in in rebuilding back better we\n4:17:51\nwant to still achieve all of this and not just physical infrastructure and housing we don't want to stop there we\n4:17:58\nwant to achieve all of this at least yes so the the list exact checklist of\n4:18:07\ntasks in the immediate medium and long term can be created in a way that it\n4:18:14\naddresses all this depending on what timelines are appropriate for each of these\n4:18:24\nokay thank you does it make sense\n4:18:30\nyeah yeah it does make sense thank you so much\n4:18:35\nit will also addresses your other question uni where you said that should there be a framework which everyone else\n4:18:42\nshould follow so I think framework should be based on the end objective\n4:18:48\nuh like for example what what is the end objective that we are aiming to achieve\n4:18:53\nnot the means through which that end objective is achieved means could be different but the end objective is to\n4:19:01\nbuild the well-being of individual then you would have to look at how different\n4:19:06\nways can you achieve that and that flexibility should be there in the program yeah very well said appears very well\n4:19:14\nput together so with this maybe we will uh\n4:19:20\nI'll hand over to twiki I think we are scheduled for a short break I'll stop sharing\n4:19:28\nyes uh thank you very much Jyoti for the session um I believe we will have a 10 minutes\n4:19:36\nbreak and then we can go to the fourth session after this sure thanks to Ricky So then see see you\n4:19:43\nall every in 10 minutes okay cool thank you very much\n4:20:16\nhi Jody um I think we can start now if you don't mind\n4:20:24\nyeah sure um let me share screen again\n4:20:31\nokay so in this fourth session we will see\n4:20:38\nthe application of capability approach and try to understand the case of\n4:20:43\ntsunami disaster uh in Chennai as piyush mentioned\n4:20:48\nearlier about tsunami it was a actually the worst tsunami recorded in\n4:20:55\nhuman history was this one and with a huge uh destruction and fit and it is\n4:21:02\nresulting in many fatalities so we will look at the case of Chennai in India\n4:21:09\nmore specifically we will look at the case of vulnerable population in Chennai\n4:21:16\nwhich was living across the coast mostly in informal settlements\n4:21:21\nto give a brief view of the disaster which happened on 26 December often\n4:21:27\nknown as The Boxing Day Disaster or Boxing Day tsunami\n4:21:32\nit happened local time in 7 59 a.m and with a magnitude of 9.1 inside the sea\n4:21:40\nwhich is like a huge magnitude and it moved the seabed to the extent that very\n4:21:46\nhigh tides were created and in this map on the right we see the water height\n4:21:54\nand above 10 meters was a danger what is the danger level and we see how at the\n4:22:01\nepicenter in Indonesia and along the coast in the eastern coast of India\n4:22:07\nincluding where Chennai is and around Sri Lanka these were the three most affected regions of and alongs and it\n4:22:15\nwent to the extent of the eastern coast in Africa so as Prius already mentioned in total\n4:22:22\naround 228 000 lives were lost in this uh unfortunate incidents and uh the largest\n4:22:31\nfatalities happened in Indonesia followed by Sri Lanka and in India some\n4:22:36\n16 270 of lives were lost as per the official record and other unnoticed\n4:22:43\nunrecorded number could be much higher and the extent was of Devastation was\n4:22:50\nhuge to in the across the Indian Ocean region amounting to around 10 billion dollars\n4:22:59\nnow focusing on Chennai which is Chennai is the fourth largest\n4:23:05\nmetropolitan city in India India itself being a populated uh country and then\n4:23:10\nwithin the country this is the fourth largest metropolitan city so we can imagine that it's a big city with around\n4:23:17\n8.9 million population as per census 2011. and at least 26 percent of the\n4:23:25\npopulation lives in slums or informal settlements now on the in the left hand picture\n4:23:33\nwe have the location or geographical distribution of these slumps as per\n4:23:38\ntheir size in terms of population the darker the color the greater is the\n4:23:44\npopulation and we can see that there are large number of slums along water bodies and also along the coast\n4:23:51\nwhich means that uh many of the people who were affected by a tsunami disaster\n4:23:57\nwere living in informal settlements before the disaster\n4:24:04\nnow the problem why we are studying Chennai case is this that when disaster\n4:24:10\nhappened it resulted in relocation of households living in the informal settlements into purpose-built\n4:24:18\nresettlement colonies while these colonies were better housing\n4:24:24\nand they also ensured Better Built environment for the people\n4:24:30\nbut through our study we found that 58 households perceive that their condition\n4:24:37\nwas no different to what it was when they were in the informal settlement so overall their housing satisfaction was\n4:24:44\nnot met but it wasn't mostly and only because of the physical\n4:24:51\ninfrastructure of housing itself but because of the impact of housing on\n4:24:57\nother dimensions of their capabilities as we discussed in the previous session\n4:25:02\nso what we did is we tried to design an extensive survey where we asked questions through\n4:25:11\nwhich we can understand those different dimensions of capability of human well-being\n4:25:18\nso overall we found these problems\n4:25:25\nwith post-disaster reconstruction and Rehabilitation approach that was adopted in Chennai firstly it was a top-down\n4:25:32\napproach based on housing and infrastructure development as we see is a typical case with many reconstruction\n4:25:38\nstrategies across the globe it was an ad hoc and reactive approach again usually\n4:25:44\nthis is the the approach we see oh involved involved resettling households\n4:25:52\nliving along riverbeds to purpose-built resettlement colonies away from the coast\n4:25:59\nthis means that they were having a sense of loss of belongingness to the Sea as\n4:26:06\nwell as they were experiencing loss of livelihood and uh far distance from\n4:26:13\ntheir original site which was also their work site meant changing their uh course\n4:26:19\nof livelihood Etc so resettlement overall was also detrimental to their\n4:26:25\nlivelihood as we will discuss a little later more in detail and overall micro environment of these\n4:26:32\nresettlement sites was not taking account that this was a fishing community and their work was related to\n4:26:39\nfishing and therefore it was not conducive to the jobs they were doing\n4:26:46\nin our research our aim was to examine the key challenges with post-disaster\n4:26:51\nreconstruction practices by using the example of experience of\n4:26:57\nresettled colonies in Chennai and the bigger purpose of this kind of research\n4:27:03\nis to propose a framework based on capability approach to understand the detriments of\n4:27:09\nwell-being these are this is one of the examples of\n4:27:16\nthe resettlement colony and as we can see these were multi-story tenant apartments and uh\n4:27:25\noverall the quality looks better to what we see\n4:27:31\nhere in this in the informal settlement we definitely can say that the physical\n4:27:38\nquality of these buildings is better but what did it do to their what the\n4:27:44\ncombination of this physical infrastructure together with its location\n4:27:50\nit didn't make much of a difference to the overall well-being of people\n4:27:55\nso we try to understand the other dimensions to give a broad view of the\n4:28:01\nsites that we were studying these were all resettlement Sites\n4:28:09\nthe picture here is of perambakkam resettlement Colony similar structures\n4:28:15\nwere built in kanagi nagar and Israel nagar\n4:28:20\nso the data we collected were from across these three locations and we\n4:28:26\nlooked into self-reported housing satisfaction but at the same time we\n4:28:32\nalso looked at many other dimensions of well-being that influence upon this\n4:28:39\nhousing satisfaction to give you a broad understanding of the\n4:28:45\nhousehold's characteristic these were mostly low-income households with\n4:28:50\nmonthly income of the main earner between 5000 to 10 000 Indian rupees\n4:28:58\nwhich is around uh 100 to 200 Australian dollars so most people were within this range\n4:29:08\nand the income of secondary earner like if there is a second member of the family who is earning sorry\n4:29:15\nif there is a second member in the family who is earning their income was\n4:29:21\nmajorly less than hundred dollars per month\n4:29:27\nso they were essentially to this is essentially to say that they are low income poor households the household\n4:29:35\nsize was uh for majority households it was around uh three to four\n4:29:41\nmembers and most of them were having four members and\n4:29:47\nnot very large households but I mean not very large in the Indian\n4:29:52\ncontext employment wise it was good to compare\n4:29:59\ntheir current employment status with their previous employment status and uh\n4:30:05\npiyusha I'll be happy for you to share your views on on this if I'm missing on\n4:30:11\nanything so as per the current employment status\n4:30:16\n71 percent people were employed and 29 percent were not employed this was a\n4:30:24\nbetter situation in terms of whether they were employed or not\n4:30:29\nemployed but this did not look very good when we compare the nature of employment that is\n4:30:37\nwhether they were self-employed or whether they were a staff so as we can see that the people who\n4:30:46\nwere self-employed is 17 percent\n4:30:51\nas opposed to 83 percent who were staff but then at the same time we need to\n4:30:58\nnotice that 87 percent of them were unskilled so if imagine your your\n4:31:04\nyourself in the shoes of a society where there are majority unskilled people who are not self-employed or rather staff so\n4:31:12\nthat means they will be employed in very low profile jobs and very low paying\n4:31:17\njobs which are not necessarily guaranteeing uh Employment Security as\n4:31:23\nwell no yeah this yeah\n4:31:29\nadd one more thing but yeah that's a very important Point here because as Jyoti was mentioning earlier\n4:31:35\nmany of these households were engaged in fishing related activities now when they\n4:31:41\nwere relocated this was 30 or 40 kilometers away from their previous location\n4:31:46\nthat source of income and economic activity suffered quite a lot they\n4:31:52\ncouldn't go fishing so they had to adopt to others so their skills at which they had developed they were of no use at\n4:32:00\nthis new location so what what as a consequence so where we see that while\n4:32:06\nthe um staff type of employment has\n4:32:11\nincreased but these are largely as security guards or maybe some of those kind of lowly jobs\n4:32:17\nthe issue is that relocation did not support their way of living and\n4:32:24\nlivelihood yeah and the shift from being uh\n4:32:31\nself-employed to employed wasn't necessarily a good thing here because self-employment there meaning they were\n4:32:37\nable to use their phishing skill and they were self-employed but having lost that many of them had to shift to pity\n4:32:43\njobs now this is another interesting finding we have\n4:32:49\nthe causes of relocation so the share of households who were\n4:32:55\naffected by natural disaster was 56 percent\n4:33:01\nand the share of households who were affected by man-made disaster was 32\n4:33:07\npercent which means that due to master plans and other things which these call these\n4:33:15\ninformal settlers were pushed out of the city towards The Fringe so many authors\n4:33:23\nalso Express the that in their findings with uh they\n4:33:29\nthey they they argue that many a times this relocation post disaster is used as\n4:33:35\nan excuse to evacuate otherwise valuable sites close to the\n4:33:41\ncity centers so uh relocation at Urban Fringe and at a\n4:33:47\ndistance from their original location is is not very ideal but this happened\n4:33:52\nin this case as well so I think here one point which becomes\n4:33:59\nvery important which led Lin was also mentioning earlier this morning that the relocation site\n4:34:05\nin Philippines were also quite far off and given that when we had the no build\n4:34:11\nzones and other kind of similar regulations which came in which prevented people from uh living in\n4:34:19\nthose areas which which were coastal areas so here\n4:34:26\nthat becomes a big problem because many a Time the formal planning for the city\n4:34:31\nuses disasters as an opportunity to pursue their development agenda\n4:34:38\nauthors have called this as disaster capitalism which was seen not only in India but in other countries as well\n4:34:45\nyeah absolutely so how far can we buy the concept of\n4:34:50\nrelocation is questionable resettlement colonies and location and\n4:34:57\nmicro environment now satisfaction and fear reported by people\n4:35:02\nwe asked if the dwelling unit had uh that suffered partial or full\n4:35:09\ndamage at previous location so 62 percent people did not suffer any\n4:35:15\nkind of damage at the previous location and yet had to be relocated\n4:35:23\nnow the satisfaction with the house at their new location which means the resettlement colony\n4:35:30\naround 58 percent people were indifferent they were neutral to before\n4:35:35\ndisaster after disaster housing whereas uh 17 percent people were\n4:35:43\ndissatisfied so put together\n4:35:48\nfor majority it either didn't make any difference to relocate or it made it worse from where they were\n4:35:58\nin terms of distance from where they were before disaster 32 percent were relocated\n4:36:06\nup to 10 kilometer and majority were relocated from beyond that\n4:36:14\nso this we can understand that how difficult would have would it have been\n4:36:19\nfor people especially this disadvantaged segment who has less accessibility to\n4:36:24\ntransport and commute given that India is not a country where public transport is very uh frequent and very easy so\n4:36:33\nmany people rely on private commute and not having access to cars or private not having a private vehicle or scooter\n4:36:40\nor bike Etc or even if they have it the fuel expenses and other things to move\n4:36:46\nto to travel back and forth from their original place of work uh meant a lot of additional expenses\n4:36:53\nand loss of time now the motivation for This research was coming from this very reason where\n4:36:59\npeople were spending a lot of time in commuting as opposed to what they were in the past I mean before disaster\n4:37:06\nand especially looking at families with young children for them it meant leaving children alone\n4:37:13\nat home given that child care system in India is\n4:37:18\nnot Advanced at all especially for those who can't afford it and we are talking about the the low income and poorest of\n4:37:26\nthe poor income segment in the country so this meant that many people were leaving their children alone at home\n4:37:33\nin a new Society in a new community where there was there were fewer friends and Families and this led to a lot of uh\n4:37:42\ndetriment to the well-being of children to the extent that many children were\n4:37:49\nslowly shifting towards drug addiction and were experiencing different kind of\n4:37:55\nbullying violence and assaults given that their parents were not able to spend much time at home and take care\n4:38:01\nof the children and also given that the social network around them was\n4:38:07\nnot existing anymore because they were all of a sudden in a new location where there was increased sense of insecurity\n4:38:16\nas opposed to the sense of peer security that they had in their previous location\n4:38:21\nthat was built over time now satisfaction with income of main\n4:38:26\nearner uh was also not that great and this satisfaction was\n4:38:36\nactually reported to be neutral for 44 which means they were uh neither very\n4:38:42\nhappy nor very dissatisfied with it but for 30 percent they were dissatisfied\n4:38:48\nwith the income of the main earner and worse was the situation for income of the uh secondary earner\n4:38:57\nsatisfaction with employment the current employment that they had uh 21 were not satisfied while 40\n4:39:06\npercent were indifferent which means at least 60 percent were either not indifferent or not satisfied with the\n4:39:14\nemployment as as compared to previously when 13\n4:39:19\nonly as compared to 21 only 13 percent were not satisfied and 47 percent were\n4:39:27\nneutral so this also tells us that uh they were probably more happy fishing\n4:39:33\nthan as opposed to doing uh other pity jobs and\n4:39:38\nif at all some skill training or other such initiatives\n4:39:44\nwould have improved their ability to settle themselves at a new location and\n4:39:50\nfind a new job as opposed to just being relocated without having any consideration to their association with\n4:39:59\nthe Sea and the job it was creating for them satisfaction with health status around\n4:40:06\nnine eighteen percent people were not satisfied with their health status and 32 percent were neutral\n4:40:14\nnow as mentioned earlier the social environment in a new community in a new\n4:40:21\nhousing community was the biggest challenge because many people from\n4:40:26\ndifferent informal settlements were brought together and the uh uh heterogeneity in the group was hard\n4:40:35\nto settle and to to harmonize so as opposed to the previous location\n4:40:41\nwhere not many new people all of a sudden come together at the same time and therefore the reception of uh one\n4:40:49\nindividual or one group of family is is better in an already established informal settlement\n4:40:56\nso the presence of family and friends in the neighborhood is very crucial to low-income earners because it either\n4:41:02\nprovides peer security to them or it takes away that so\n4:41:07\nin this case uh presence of family and friends people around 16 percent people\n4:41:15\nwere not satisfied with the the presence of family and friends which was missing\n4:41:21\nand 55 percent who are neutral\n4:41:26\nhouseholds now what we want to do is we have created indicators which then over\n4:41:32\ntime tells us whether this neighborhood is uh helping people meet their\n4:41:39\naffiliation needs or not or something that should be done to to improve their\n4:41:46\na sense of belonging with the place and building relationships so we have\n4:41:52\ncreated these indicators but we we are now trying to build a panel data over time so that we can we can uh look into\n4:41:59\nthese again so we have nothing nothing to compare but the system gives us some\n4:42:05\nidea of the indicators that we can use for design to understand the capabilities necessary for people like\n4:42:12\nhouseholds participation in social events can tell us their affiliation whether their affiliation needs are\n4:42:19\ngetting fulfilled or not instead of directly asking people are you satisfied with the neighborhood\n4:42:28\nwe want to ask questions which are informing us that rather than just the\n4:42:34\nsubjective perception of the individual so around\n4:42:40\n21 people were not satisfied or were not participating in the so in social events\n4:42:48\nneighborhood interaction level was not satisfactory for 20 people and also\n4:42:56\nhouseholds willingness to help neighbors during disaster uh at least 23 percent people were not\n4:43:04\nsatisfied with how their neighbors were behaving with them or how they were behaving with their\n4:43:10\nneighbors now whether people were having satisfaction with employment related\n4:43:17\ncontacts around 21 percent people were not satisfied and 58 people were uh\n4:43:24\nneutral so these are the kind of indicators we have created we also want to monitor the\n4:43:30\nsocial environment for children particularly so presence of friends for children at\n4:43:36\nleast 22 percent people were not satisfied and majority which is 59\n4:43:42\npercent were neutral support system for children has similar statistics around\n4:43:48\n19 families who are not satisfied and 62 percent were neutral\n4:43:56\nnow again as mentioned by uh in in the earlier session in the list of\n4:44:01\ncapabilities by nurse form that being able to express one's emotions without\n4:44:07\nfear is crucial and especially after having experienced\n4:44:14\na disaster there were many kind of fears and anxieties that have developed among\n4:44:19\npeople and children especially so we asked people if they do fear disasters\n4:44:25\nand we found that majority people like good 43 percent fear disaster\n4:44:33\neither are extremely fearful or very fearful of disaster\n4:44:39\nthe again a similar number for fear of loss of life around 43 percent people\n4:44:46\nwere extremely fearful or fearful of loss of life having seen or experienced disaster from\n4:44:54\na closed distance these fears were important to overcome and it is important for us to to understand\n4:45:01\nwhat kind of mechanism post disaster restitution mechanism should be put in place to help people overcome these fear\n4:45:10\nnow fear of loss of house or asset remained among 44 people which means and\n4:45:17\nand it is ironic that many of these resettlement colonies were flooded in\n4:45:22\nseasonal flooding in Chennai so this means that the location of these resettlement colonies was not risk-free\n4:45:30\nso whether it was worth relocating or not as questionable and that has also\n4:45:35\nled to fear of loss of house innocent A continuing fear of loss of housing is it\n4:45:40\namong 44 people now fear due to lack of food security was existing in 50 people which means\n4:45:50\nthat this is not only indicative of lack of social security systems in in place\n4:45:57\nbut this is also indicative of the loss of opportunities for employment\n4:46:03\nas compared to before disaster because as we mentioned this as well as the fishing community and now they are\n4:46:09\ndepending on very low paying jobs for food and food security\n4:46:17\nnow the fear of social disorder also existed among 44 people\n4:46:24\nwhich means that uh the the new settlement or the New Colony is not\n4:46:30\npeople are not receiving it as or perceiving it as a place of social harmony\n4:46:36\nfear of loss of Education even though we are talking about the least educated uh\n4:46:42\nand least earning population for them education is the only instrument to\n4:46:47\nbreak that poverty trap and therefore they fear the loss of Education the most and at least uh 61 51 person people were\n4:46:57\nwere extremely fearful of the loss of Education after the change of location and resettlement\n4:47:02\nthank you fear of loss of income and employment\n4:47:07\nalso prevailed among many people around at least 52 percent people feared that\n4:47:14\nthey will they will lose income and employment this also tells us that the shift or an after relocation uh their\n4:47:21\nemployment situation wasn't very good and therefore the the sustainability of that Community is questionable\n4:47:30\nfear of injuries caused by a disaster existed among 44 person people who are\n4:47:35\nextremely fearful of getting injured or in disaster\n4:47:40\nlooking at the neighborhood and incidences of physical violence in\n4:47:45\nthe neighborhood 19 people reported that they have either experienced or\n4:47:51\nwitnessed incidences of violence in the neighborhood this is a higher number and\n4:47:57\nuh this this is the major concern in these resettlement colonies nowadays\n4:48:05\nthis brings us to the questions on safety of women and children especially\n4:48:10\ngiven that they are the most vulnerable and uh most or most easy victims to violence so\n4:48:19\naround 13 people were very dissatisfied with the level of safety within house\n4:48:25\nwhich means that there must be high number cases of domestic violence or\n4:48:31\nassault and 34 were neutral they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with it\n4:48:37\nabout safety at the next level of built environment just outside the house which\n4:48:44\nis in the current neighborhood the numbers are not very different uh\n4:48:50\naround 15 percent people were very dissatisfied with the level of safety they experienced in the neighborhood\n4:48:57\nand this number is comparable to what was in their\n4:49:03\nprevious location around 14 people were very dissatisfied with safety in their previous location however\n4:49:10\nthe level or the number of people who were satisfied was higher in the previous\n4:49:18\nlocation as far as safety and bus\n4:49:23\nin buses or roads on in public transport is concerned that's also questionable\n4:49:28\nbecause at least 13 people were very dissatisfied with it and that also meant\n4:49:34\nuh as we were talking about it earlier that it is not only the resource but\n4:49:39\nalso the environment uh here the environment of safety at a\n4:49:45\nsocietal level that either allows or curtails people's use of resources so in\n4:49:51\nthis case public transport can be less useful to women who have who are\n4:49:57\ndissatisfied with the level of safety in those mode of commutes\n4:50:07\nabout children their safety within the house was concerned for 14 households\n4:50:13\nwho are not very satisfied or rather who are very dissatisfied with safety of\n4:50:18\nchildren inside the house and similar number or rather a higher number of people were dissatisfied with\n4:50:25\nthe safety in the current neighborhood and this definitely when compared to the\n4:50:32\nprevious neighborhood was lower and relatively only 15 percent people were\n4:50:39\ndissatisfied with safety of children in the previous neighborhood this tells this tells us some or this gives us some\n4:50:46\nidea of the peer Security in the neighborhood that develops over time with mutual Harmony and respect for for\n4:50:53\nthe residents towards each other as opposed to a New resettlement Colony\n4:50:58\nwhere the society is very heterogeneous and po security is not existing\n4:51:06\nso our key findings uh based on This research\n4:51:12\nsuggests that opportunities for household income are usually not equally\n4:51:17\ndistributed in in such resettlement colonies or in post-disaster approaches\n4:51:23\ngenerally importance of neighborhood security and social capital is underscored and this\n4:51:31\nis particularly important for communities or which depend on each\n4:51:36\nother and on the social groups for physical security and Capital Security\n4:51:45\nsafety level in neighborhood and access to an informal or social system for\n4:51:50\nchildren are important to these communities and when relocating or when\n4:51:56\ncreating a Housing Society for them we need to be thoughtful of these requirements\n4:52:03\nthe cultural inappropriateness of housing constructed for post-disaster\n4:52:08\nresettlement is also an issue flooding and consequential fear of\n4:52:14\nlosing asset house or house still persist and this fear was also existing\n4:52:20\nfor the loss of life and uh security Etc\n4:52:26\nsatisfactory level of protection from disaster adds to the well-being of the households\n4:52:32\nnow this satisfaction and and overcoming with fear and anxiety also requires\n4:52:39\nadditional efforts in terms of psychological counseling and other\n4:52:45\nmechanisms that can help people come out of the trauma social equity and empowerment of female\n4:52:52\nis necessary for well-being overall and even housing well-being\n4:52:59\nsorry safety and well-being of children and women needs to be addressed when we\n4:53:04\nare considering relocation and resettlement\n4:53:09\nbased on This research some recommendations that we made for uh\n4:53:16\npost-disaster reconstruction was to set the focus on nc2 development of housing\n4:53:21\nwhere housing was destroyed and it's possible to rebuild\n4:53:27\ncarefully crafted insurance policies for income and property land and housing\n4:53:32\nloss although as piyush mentioned earlier the penetration rate of insurance in Asians countries is very\n4:53:40\nlittle and therefore this may take a long time to to show any good results\n4:53:47\nnevertheless this this is a good way forward and we\n4:53:52\ndo encourage such policies that improve the penetration rate of insurance also\n4:53:59\ninsurance policies for the loss of life disaster May speed up the recovery\n4:54:05\nprocess as we have observed in the case of Japan and immediately after disaster\n4:54:11\nmitigating the negative effect of loss of income would require approaches like\n4:54:17\nDirect Cash transfers if the need be long-term plans for guaranteeing income\n4:54:23\nsecurity would require substitution of jobs and employment this is crucial to\n4:54:29\noverall satisfaction and well-being of people\n4:54:34\nfurther we recommend connectivity of resettlement colonies through public transport to places of employment and\n4:54:42\nalso accessibility to health and other services are of what mode utmost importance\n4:54:49\ncore design and quality of Housing and neighborhood environment that does not meet cultural and social expectations\n4:54:55\ncan aggregate aggravate post-disaster trauma among people\n4:55:01\nit may be worth exploring the opportunity for people LED planning and development that is\n4:55:07\nincremental and inclusionary in nature the spiritual also discussed earlier in\n4:55:12\nthe case of Indonesia Indonesia it is important to take design and\n4:55:20\nnon-design steps to create positive social perception about settlement colonies\n4:55:25\nwhich are currently viewed as ghosts of Empower impoverished\n4:55:30\nit is interesting that uh how we create new ghettos uh and we just relocate the\n4:55:38\nold ghettos rather than trying to mix it with the overall uh and and integrate\n4:55:43\nthe society and the in in physical sense and therefore encourage social\n4:55:50\nintegration through these physical intervention we usually don't take these opportunities as as uh and to to\n4:55:57\nencourage that social and economic infrastructure should precede resettlement this is\n4:56:05\noften missing not just in case of India but in case of other countries as well\n4:56:11\nSo based on this experience the broad level generalizable principles that we\n4:56:17\nsuggest for post-disaster reconstruction is that relocation should be should not\n4:56:24\nbe detrimental to households in securing income opportunities\n4:56:29\nhousing should respond to the requirements of the household although sounds like an obvious thing but we\n4:56:36\noften uh recreate housing plans and layouts\n4:56:42\nwithout considering the specific requirements of the community which is\n4:56:47\ngoing to use them avoiding disrupting social systems which\n4:56:52\nare based on trust and care for each other and particularly for children is\n4:56:59\ncrucial to the overall well-being of the vulnerable communities we should take\n4:57:04\ncare of that we should ensure social equity and empowerment of women\n4:57:11\nwe should devise mechanism for protection of asset and houses and income of low-income households through\n4:57:18\npublic Insurance systems we should try to resettle households which does not disadvantage them through\n4:57:25\nsocial stratification or affect their self-identity\n4:57:33\nthese are some of the references that we have used in these discussions now as a\n4:57:39\nuh your questions uh and feedback are invited of course\n4:57:44\nand at the same time I want to you to take you back to the\n4:57:51\nearlier discussion on the list of capabilities and\n4:57:56\nprobably this is an opportunity where we want to discuss with you\n4:58:01\nthe ways to build back better across these 10 dimensions of central\n4:58:09\nhuman capability again uh fuchsia I will request you to\n4:58:15\ncontribute to the discussions and also seek your views or feedback or if I have\n4:58:21\nmissed anything in the presentation in the previous slides I think geothers was a very\n4:58:27\ncomprehensive presentation and it ties together a lot\n4:58:33\nof discussions that we had and we can use this as a framework so when uh\n4:58:38\nearlier we were discussing about Philippines or Indonesia where relocation is an uh is an issue livelihood is a question\n4:58:45\nwhat kind of shelter does it appropriately address\n4:58:50\num the requirements of household how do you ensure that during initial phase of\n4:58:57\ndisaster uh the income flow continues as people are trying to rebuild their lives\n4:59:04\nand also as the cash transfer better compared to and this was shown in case of Philippines where people were given\n4:59:11\nemergency shelter assistance in the form of material vouchers and so on which they\n4:59:17\nwere not able to use it immediately to procure things but rather by using uh\n4:59:22\nwas selling it at a discount to others who can lend them money so these are the\n4:59:28\nkey questions that we need to ask and understand that what kind of disaster\n4:59:33\nreconstruction program that we are designing so again uh maybe worthwhile\n4:59:39\nopening it up for everyone and seek their views on\n4:59:46\nsome of these look like they are very difficult to reinstall\n4:59:53\nfor example control over one's environment this is\n5:00:00\nnot a short-term thing this is more of an Institutional overhauling that will\n5:00:05\nbe required to establish control of people over their built environment and\n5:00:10\nI think in the case of post-disaster reconstruction\n5:00:15\nuh people the only instrument that people have to raise their opinion and voice is\n5:00:22\nby voting out the local Council of the local government but uh\n5:00:29\nis is that vulnerable segment aware of it and uh I mean in the context of India\n5:00:36\nmany times very small promises can buy their votes for example just installing\n5:00:43\na working drainage system in an informal settlement can buy the votes good enough to incentivize people to to\n5:00:50\nsway their votes towards certain body so what kind of control are we\n5:00:56\ntalking about here and how do we improve people's control on their built environment on their own environment\n5:01:03\nforeign again I would probably uh bring back the\n5:01:11\nearlier observation that Led Led Len was making where she said that in the\n5:01:17\nrelocation communities the people were not happy because there was uh they were fishing communities who\n5:01:25\nneeded a place to dry their fish and it was not there so that has an impact on\n5:01:32\ntheir ability to control their environment so it's very important that while designing program or designing\n5:01:38\nshelter we are not just too overly concerned about the physicality of the\n5:01:45\nshelter but rather we look at the functionality of a shelter and what kind\n5:01:50\nof things that it was doing for people and are we able to reconstruct those\n5:01:56\nthat's a very important uh push that you brought it up again like uh we don't\n5:02:03\nunderstand like this like it was actually surprising for me as well because uh we have we don't\n5:02:11\nreceive or understand things from the Viewpoint of the residents what was surprising for\n5:02:17\nme was how well established the peer system in informal settlements is to\n5:02:23\ntake care of children so it was very very uh eye-opening for me\n5:02:30\nto know how that has been lost just at the blink of eye by relocation\n5:02:35\nand what it means is the safety not just physical safety but also the safety of\n5:02:41\ntheir future is risked suppose because because if they are not physically safe\n5:02:49\nthey are in trauma and they are not having they then there are many\n5:02:54\nfunctionings of children is compromised that their ability to express emotions because they are experiencing bully\n5:03:01\ntheir ability to play and uh enjoy their life as children and Recreation and then\n5:03:06\nthis will have an impact on their education their performance their\n5:03:12\nemotional development and therefore their future yeah\n5:03:17\nludlin has asked one question um she is wondering how control over\n5:03:24\nenvironment can be translated to voting and be consistent\n5:03:29\nso there are a couple of points here to make a learning recently there were elections in Delhi the local government\n5:03:36\nelection and it was an eye-opener because\n5:03:42\nthe localities which were poor which were informal the percentage of people\n5:03:48\nwho voted were significantly larger like 62 percent of\n5:03:54\npeople who voted were from there while the localities which were well\n5:03:59\nestablished and their medium middle income classes or the high income classes lived which are formal planned\n5:04:07\nthe voting of voting percentage was lower so for people who are living in\n5:04:15\nvulnerable situation like informal settlements or in unplanned areas\n5:04:22\nit's negotiation through these political means that\n5:04:28\nensures their survival and access to the services which are not available to them\n5:04:33\nuh in the formal planning situation so\n5:04:39\nthe people use their voting right to assert number one their citizenship and\n5:04:45\nnumber two to negotiate their uh requirements with the establishment so\n5:04:54\nfrom that point of view it becomes important that um control over one's environment\n5:04:59\nthrough voting is an important channel here\n5:05:08\num let me say something yes please uh\n5:05:15\nI would be happy if that was how things turned out here because for instance uh\n5:05:22\nif people have control over one's environment they should have removed political leaders who were responsible\n5:05:29\nfor bad housing for the delay in the Reconstruction Etc the lack of services apparently\n5:05:36\nthey meaning this and these survivors uh\n5:05:42\nJustin put them back into office that's why I was asking how do we uh uh\n5:05:48\nmake certain alignments that the truly uh control over one's environment will\n5:05:54\nalso Translate into an uh a good uh electoral Choice\n5:06:01\nmeaning uh political leaders who will be protecting them who will be giving them\n5:06:08\na good environment so that's one of the I know my my concern the other thing\n5:06:15\nthat I'd like to share with you is if there's one thing that was quite a\n5:06:20\npositive a thing that happened in the resettlement side was that mothers expressed that the prior to\n5:06:28\nYolanda families with the children with special disabilities uh would not know each\n5:06:35\nother they would tend to hide their children but when they were relocated they discovered that they're quite a\n5:06:43\ngood number of survivors meaning families with special children and that\n5:06:49\nnow they freely roamed around they can bring their children those with special\n5:06:55\nneeds outside of their homes so that was something that really caught my\n5:07:00\nattention because even myself I was surprised that there were several\n5:07:06\nfamilies with children with special needs so and I'm I'm also curious as to\n5:07:12\nuh what factors led uh to this Mother's uh courage to bring their children out\n5:07:20\nto the open that's all thank you thank you very much I think that's a wonderful point but may\n5:07:27\nI ask one question um whether the design of program\n5:07:34\nensured um more uh what do you call it inclusivity\n5:07:41\nor was it just a kind of by chance it happened\n5:07:48\nbecause people were brought together and it just happened that many of them were\n5:07:56\nsuffering from disabilities or some other kind of\n5:08:02\nconcern they just got together by accident or was it a positive thing in the program\n5:08:08\nI think that's inclusivity as I said earlier because different people have different requirements should be the\n5:08:14\npart of the program by Design yeah okay um so far the housing design here did\n5:08:22\nthat really follow according to uh one's needs like a structure for the elderly a\n5:08:27\nfamily with the uh children with special needs uh we didn't follow that it's the\n5:08:34\nsame structure for for everyone whether uh for the normal ones and those with the special needs I think it's uh I this\n5:08:43\nis the only way observation I really do I'm not sure if it's the environment uh\n5:08:49\nbecause uh they're now uh what's this close to to one another\n5:08:55\nbecause they are living in raw houses unlike when they were still in in the coast uh uh they were uh they were uh\n5:09:03\nliving far from each other and uh and they didn't know who was uh with having\n5:09:08\nuh whose family uh were I know having uh special uh children so it it was uh\n5:09:17\nthere are no relocation since since uh the relocation\n5:09:23\num brought them to become neighbors that they realized that they're quite a good\n5:09:31\nnumber of families with those children plus the fact that I think it's the\n5:09:38\nroads because uh in in GMA for instance GMA kapuso uh Village that the roads are\n5:09:44\npaved and so they can easily bring the the small kids uh outside unlike uh in\n5:09:51\nthe coast where they find the difficulty there was not really uh much space\n5:09:56\nas to the programs uh I don't think there was this program for uh family\n5:10:02\nfamilies with special needs because they were actually uh looking forward to\n5:10:07\nhumanitarian organization to prove to provide them because they feel that government cannot provide uh assistance\n5:10:14\nuh for families with special children with special needs yeah I think that's a very important\n5:10:21\nPoint here which you are making earlier because in Indian case where Jyoti was presenting those four-story buildings\n5:10:29\nthat you see there is no elevator so think of a family which is someone who\n5:10:34\nis disabled and they have to go up and down uh even once in a day it will be a\n5:10:40\nmajor task so the question is that while the disaster reconstruction is becoming\n5:10:46\nbetter as the lessons are being learned but if we look at the if we had the\n5:10:52\noutcome as the starting point that what do we want to achieve then we would work\n5:10:58\nbackwards and design programs that would reach those outcomes if we would have said that like look\n5:11:03\num the safety of bodily Integrity or safety is\n5:11:08\nis something that we have to achieve then we'll say that okay for women what needs to be done when we are designing\n5:11:15\nour common areas Parks or recreational areas how do we design in such a way\n5:11:21\nthat it's inclusive and at the same time safe so that no one is under the\n5:11:27\npressure or under the threat how do we design our bus stops that the women are not harassed there it's it's possible to\n5:11:35\ndo that right so the question is that like where do we start should we start\n5:11:40\nfrom the point that we have lost these things so it has to be built or should we start from the point that these are\n5:11:46\nthe things which we want to achieve because they are important for well-being and then work backwards and design our programs so that's the\n5:11:52\nquestion which we are trying to address here Jyoti what do you like to add yeah\n5:11:58\num uh as uh Anna is acknowledging that perhaps it was a positive externality of\n5:12:04\na coping mechanism due to being resettled very rightly he put Anna I I\n5:12:11\nthink uh probably there is a lesson to be taken that when we are combining or when we are resettling if at all we need\n5:12:18\nto do that there should be some sense of responsibility to be inclusive of course and then uh\n5:12:29\nbenefit from the commonalities that people who are resettled may have and in\n5:12:36\nthis case the commonality is their vulnerability to physical disability or their their the need for special\n5:12:42\nrequirements the commonality could be the old age requiring some uh put some\n5:12:51\nsome assistance Etc so while mixing people is a good\n5:12:57\nthing but we can be more sensible when we are putting new communities together now one of the question about uh\n5:13:05\nthe voting the power to vote how it can be\n5:13:11\nused to give more control to people over their environment is also related to\n5:13:16\nwhat uni is asking very rightly uh understood by uni that\n5:13:24\nuh these settlements were not formal settlements they were informal settlements before disaster which means\n5:13:31\nthat people did not have legal rights on the land that they were\n5:13:38\nresiding on now this means they were not entitled\n5:13:44\nfor any formal Services be it Water Sanitation electricity\n5:13:50\nor gas LPG Etc so this meant they were very much in\n5:13:58\nneed of those basic services even though their citizenship rights and\n5:14:03\ntheir right to vote is independent of whether they are entitled to the land\n5:14:09\nthat they are acquiring but then they become very interrelated\n5:14:14\nbecause to be entitled to uh not to be entitled rather to be having access to\n5:14:20\nthe basic services like water and sanitation and electricity and LPG\n5:14:26\npeople then uh don't have their rights and if some rights are given to them in\n5:14:34\nthe they then then those are more like obligations or favors and not rights\n5:14:42\nbecause the access to water standardization Etc is linked to a legal property right\n5:14:49\nso does this mean how is India coping up with this problem is by formalizing\n5:14:56\nslumps which means that uh without relocating slums\n5:15:02\nthose slums which are which have survived long enough and where people have been residing for certain number of\n5:15:09\nyears those slumps uh then acknowledge the residents to be the legal residence\n5:15:16\nand having the right to shelter security while being at the same location where\n5:15:23\nthey are and then their rights to other services like water and sanitation and\n5:15:29\nelectricity are de facto uh provided but\n5:15:34\nfor informal slums which was the case with the Chennai uh you know residents\n5:15:40\nthat we were studying for informal slums uh those basic rights or access to what\n5:15:46\nis annotation is also difficult and that is where uh political parties try to offer them\n5:15:54\nthose basic requirements and that becomes a favor against which\n5:16:03\nthey see quotes now if people have the entitlement\n5:16:08\nof property or legal right on property then uh they will be able to use their\n5:16:15\nvoting rights more properly without under without any influence because then\n5:16:22\nthey will be entitled to all other exes to services so I think this broadly uh\n5:16:29\nuh puts into light Uni's question that how should we address the challenge of\n5:16:37\nillegal property occupancy and how can we overcome that\n5:16:43\nwhat do you think piyush I think absolutely so\n5:16:51\num the legal right which has been the land rights have been one of the key component of any of the post-disaster\n5:16:57\nprogram and um they are important as\n5:17:04\nthey provide the control over their own environment through voting rights and through the ability to\n5:17:11\nmodify the places where they live the one question which bothers me and\n5:17:18\nthis is my personal opinion here is that that we observed in case of Chennai also\n5:17:23\nwhen people were living in informal settlements they were living in for many\n5:17:29\nmany years even before the city of Chennai was formed so if they had a historical reasons why they were living\n5:17:35\nin those locations and when they were placed into formal resettlement colonies\n5:17:42\nthere was a requirement of payment for the maintenance uh so the properties\n5:17:49\nsince it was all multi-family buildings they had to be maintained so this they were required to\n5:17:55\npay now in the informal settlements they were not accustomed to paying this and\n5:18:02\nlow income household they felt that it's a substantial burden which is being imposed on them in the name of formality\n5:18:10\nthey said that de facto right to land they already had in the previous location as well so that's very\n5:18:17\nimportant then when when the land rights are granted there has to be a visible\n5:18:23\ndistinctive benefits that the household should see otherwise they will see that\n5:18:29\nit's an imposition on additional burden on them rather than a benefit\n5:18:37\nyes now uh I was also wondering that uh how\n5:18:43\ngood or bad are we doing as a society when it comes to having data on these softer aspects\n5:18:52\nwhich are not assist based for example the\n5:18:58\nneed to express emotions is very related to mental health status\n5:19:03\nof people now what can we do and how should this be addressed whether\n5:19:10\nI mean of course it is uh an important element of well-being\n5:19:16\nirrespective of whether it's post-disaster or pre-disaster but this is particularly important post-disaster\n5:19:24\nmore so among younger age groups or children like the need to express their\n5:19:30\nfear and anxiety and to address it is crucial to their overall well-being\n5:19:35\nnow what can be done and what should be done and what are societies doing are is is any country proactively looking into\n5:19:44\nit I would like to benefit from the experience of everyone who is participating here if they have\n5:19:50\nsomething to share on this dimension of well-being or any other dimension which we can learn\n5:20:13\nmaybe I will add one observation which I have seen in the context of Australia\n5:20:20\nwhere um the disaster relief operation strike\n5:20:25\nteams they have one or two psychological Council counselors uh as part of that\n5:20:32\nteam because they realize that mental trauma that the households face after disasters are quite significant and\n5:20:39\ndetrimental for the future of their own reconstruction so uh they have started in including the\n5:20:48\npsychologist within their their their their strike teams uh post-disaster\n5:20:57\nthat's a very formalized system yeah but I would like to hear from what is\n5:21:04\nhappening in Philippines or Indonesia or any other countries\n5:21:09\nuh may share uh immediately after Yolanda\n5:21:15\nwe saw we observed a lot of people appearing to have a mental distress but\n5:21:23\nuh uh some of my friends especially those who were working in the church to\n5:21:29\nuh believe that if people would be\n5:21:34\nprovided immediately livelihood packages the so-called mental anguish anxiety\n5:21:40\nwould be lessened uh if uh based on our experience this mental issues becomes\n5:21:48\nmore prominent if people do not have livelihood if people do not have something to eat so if there's food\n5:21:55\nthere's livelihood the tendency for uh mental issues would be reduced that is\n5:22:01\nas far as our observation is concerned yeah I think that's absolutely right the\n5:22:08\nfirst thing is that during the initial phases it's important that the flow of\n5:22:15\nincome is there and because without that it could cause significant damage to\n5:22:22\ntheir mental well-being so income has to support their day-to-day requirements otherwise that will be a problem so\n5:22:29\nsometimes it is argued that probably cash transfer in the initial period is\n5:22:34\nmuch better as an instrument rather than trying to solve their problem through other mechanisms\n5:22:41\nyeah because cash transfer will probably at least meet the uh requirement of\n5:22:47\nincome loss in the short term while people are trying to install back their\n5:22:52\njobs and uh security job security and in this case in the case of Chennai\n5:22:59\nit isn't easy in uh in India to find employment for a graduate or\n5:23:06\npostgraduate let alone an uneducated person who is not skilled so the transition from being a fisherman\n5:23:13\nto being unemployed was very quick and the transition from being unemployed to\n5:23:19\nemployed again would probably not happen so in that case how long do you think\n5:23:26\nthe cash transfers can support people\n5:23:31\nor should support people that's a good question so it's a it's not that easy answer there\n5:23:40\nbecause the Reconstruction of livelihood takes a lot of time\n5:23:45\nand it's always better to uh reinstate the original\n5:23:52\nlivelihood that the people were engaged in rather than trying to create a new one because that would require\n5:24:00\ntraining that would require lots of other things which which is very difficult which is not easy\n5:24:08\nso I guess maybe it brings us back to the question of um\n5:24:13\nwhen we are looking at some of these capabilities that in order to ensure that what what\n5:24:19\npath should we take there could be numerous different paths and that's where the flexibility should be that\n5:24:26\nthat's where the individual characteristic and requirement should be\n5:24:31\ntaken into account rather than trying to impose the very similar kind of formula on all those who are affected\n5:24:38\nyeah yeah definitely I agree with you there and uh I mean there are so many things\n5:24:46\nto be thought about uh when we open this list of capabilities firstly we we have\n5:24:54\nso much thinking to do in terms of the indicators that can inform us\n5:25:01\nabout the appropriateness of the actions that we may plan to improve these uh\n5:25:08\ncapabilities for example if we are trying to improve one's control over one's environment\n5:25:14\nwhat is how are we going to measure whether we are doing the right thing or the wrong things\n5:25:19\nit's not necessarily to measure by uh having a measurable quantifiable\n5:25:25\nindicator like voting rate but also people's own perception and we shy away\n5:25:32\nfrom adopting any personalized approach to development because it involves talking\n5:25:38\nto people and we we often give the justification that it will be time consuming\n5:25:45\nbut does it have to come otherwise at the cost of people's well-being probably\n5:25:51\nnot it can be time consuming but it will be worth it so some of these uh\n5:25:58\nactions post disaster definitely require immediate attention and may not give us\n5:26:04\nallow ample time to consult people or involve them in the discussion but\n5:26:11\nmost of the short to medium term plans will give us the opportunity to talk to people and involve them in the process\n5:26:19\nso uh although I feel uh where to draw the line for example after\n5:26:26\ndisaster people are usually not in their best physical health State and if let's\n5:26:33\nsay we want to involve them in so many discussions and uh policies\n5:26:41\npeople get tired they want outcome so again where to draw the line\n5:26:52\nso I think with that uh if anyone has any other\n5:26:57\nviews I will invite that now and otherwise I'll pass it back to twiki\n5:27:12\nhey Jyoti um great thanks very much so um are there any further questions for\n5:27:19\nthis session foreign\n5:27:30\nI believe this would be the end of the workshop unless perseveration do you\n5:27:35\nwant to add anything before I close this session with the closing remarks recorded closing remarks from Dr sitaru\n5:27:43\nthank you very much Ricky the only thing which I wanted to say here is that the idea of this Workshop was more to uh\n5:27:52\nthink together in the direction of what should be the framework\n5:27:58\nwhich could help us in determining what a post-disaster construction look like\n5:28:04\nwe were not give uh we the idea is not to have a\n5:28:12\nkind of developed framework or something which is like a solution here but it's\n5:28:18\nmore important to start thinking in the direction of what could be that uh common framework\n5:28:24\nwhich could then bring together different parties of different\n5:28:29\nstakeholders get over those coordination and management issues all the funding\n5:28:34\nissues that we spoke about in our earlier sessions and think\n5:28:40\nwhat a unified solution or framework would look like while the solution could be many\n5:28:47\nfor each individual or each society and for each disaster\n5:28:55\ngreat thanks very much um did you want to add anything else before a person to the recorded\n5:29:02\num closing remarks yeah definitely uh very briefly I would like to uh first\n5:29:07\nthank all the participants and uh I would like to leave you with the thought\n5:29:13\nuh that we are not doing enough and\n5:29:18\nhere is a framework just the exception of Thinking Beyond what we are doing and\n5:29:24\nhow can we do it better and capability theory is just one of the ways to think\n5:29:30\nforward and it will be good to question the end objectives that we are trying to\n5:29:37\nachieve and whether they are adequate and what can be done better so I'll leave leave at that note great\n5:29:43\nthanks uh so uh we have this closing remark from Dr sitaram on a senior\n5:29:49\nConsulting specialist from the adbi I will share uh his closing remarks here\n5:30:04\nare you able to hear the um good afternoon\n5:30:09\nthank you for joining today's workshop on sustainable approaches to post-disaster reconstruction\n5:30:16\nI'm delighted that we had a full day workshop with intense discussions on the challenges and opportunities for\n5:30:22\nsustainable post-disaster reconstruction I hope all participants appreciate the\n5:30:28\nneed to move away from traditional Quick Fix approaches towards a more sustainable and resilient\n5:30:36\nsolution in this regard it is necessary to consider not only the physical needs of\n5:30:42\na community but also the social economic and psychological needs of the people\n5:30:47\nwho are affected more importantly stakeholders must come\n5:30:52\ntogether and collaborate for the long-term development of the affected community\n5:30:58\nmy sincere gratitude to our distinguished experts professor piyush tiwari and Dr Jyoti\n5:31:04\nShukla who jointly led the workshop very well I would like to also thank our\n5:31:10\ncolleagues from the Asian development Bank in the headquarters and the asean Secretariat for their kind support and\n5:31:18\nguidance for the workshop we will incorporate the learnings from\n5:31:23\nthis Workshop when we finalize the edited volume\n5:31:28\nto which several of you have contributed and Professor tiwari is one of the co-editors\n5:31:34\nfinally my sincere appreciation to my colleagues at ADB Institute Wiki sakshi\n5:31:39\nand Aki savanaka for their support to successfully deliver today's Workshop have a good evening thank you\n5:31:49\nyes sir yes that closest today's um quite a long day so I really\n5:31:55\nappreciate you for coming um really early in in

Key points include:\n\n1. **Challenges in Reconstruction**: The discussion highlights issues such as inadequate housing, loss of livelihoods, and lack of social support in resettlement areas. There's a focus on how disaster responses often fail to consider the unique needs and cultural contexts of affected communities.\n\n2. **Capability Approach**: The presentation explores using the capability approach to assess and improve the well-being of disaster-affected individuals. This includes addressing not just physical needs but also emotional, social, and economic aspects.\n\n3. **Data Collection and Indicators**: The importance of collecting data on various well-being indicators, such as mental health, social integration, and access to resources, is emphasized. This data can inform better policy and program design.\n\n4. **Inclusive Planning**: The need for inclusive planning that involves affected communities in decision-making processes is stressed. This helps ensure that reconstruction efforts meet the real needs of the people and improve their overall quality of life.\n\n5. **Livelihood Restoration**: The discussion underlines the critical role of livelihood restoration in post-disaster recovery. Without addressing economic stability, other aspects of well-being cannot be fully realized.\n\n6. **Future Directions**: The participants discuss the need for a comprehensive and adaptable framework for post-disaster reconstruction that can be tailored to specific contexts and challenges.\n\nThe workshop aims to encourage new thinking and practical solutions to enhance post-disaster resilience and quality of life for affected populations.",

The session included:\n\n1. **Challenges in Post-Disaster Reconstruction**: The conversation highlighted common issues such as inadequate housing, loss of livelihoods, and lack of social support, particularly in resettlement areas. These challenges often stem from top-down approaches that fail to consider the unique cultural and social contexts of affected communities.\n\n2. **Capability Approach**: The use of the capability approach was discussed as a framework for assessing and enhancing the well-being of individuals in disaster-affected areas. This approach emphasizes the importance of not just physical infrastructure but also emotional, social, and economic well-being.\n\n3. **Data Collection and Indicators**: The session stressed the importance of collecting data on various well-being indicators, including mental health, social integration, and access to resources. This data can help design policies and programs that more effectively address the needs of disaster-affected populations.\n\n4. **Inclusive Planning and Community Involvement**: Participants underscored the necessity of involving affected communities in the planning and decision-making processes. This inclusion helps ensure that reconstruction efforts are responsive to the actual needs of the people, leading to better outcomes.\n\n5. **Livelihood Restoration**: A significant focus was on the importance of restoring livelihoods as a critical component of recovery. Ensuring that people have access to stable and adequate sources of income is essential for overall well-being and resilience.\n\n6. **Future Directions and Framework Development**: The workshop called for the development of a comprehensive, flexible framework for post-disaster reconstruction. This framework should be adaptable to different contexts and challenges, ensuring that it can address the diverse needs of affected communities effectively.\n\nThe workshop aimed to foster new thinking and practical solutions to improve post-disaster resilience and the quality of life for those affected by disasters.",
