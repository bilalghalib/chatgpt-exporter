      "content": "I have a friend who is not wanting to go to military service and is a refugee living in lebanon for a long time. he got sent back to syria and now is facing sentencing mandating him to go to military service. i want to help him pay the exception fine which is 7000 dollars and want to help him stay with his daughter and mom in a village he knows instead of living as a stranger - illiterate, without skills, and struggling in countries that don't want him like lebanon which did not allow him to work or establish himself because they wanted him to go back to syria. and even if he does go through smugglers to get to the EU he will not integrate well and will be away from his family. Which is why we are chosing to spend the 7000 dollars to get him to stay with his family in syria. Can you help me come up with a gofundme pitch that uses their best practices. I have this as a title:\nKeep Ahmed With His Family and Out of Military Service\n\nFirst summarize the story, i got to know him as my neighbor when he was polishing shoes as as treet kid. we sent him to school and it didn't work, got him equipment to sell thigns and the police took them, we tried so many times and it doesn't work. he has a super green thumb and is so generous with the nothing he has. he brought rotten tomatoes and pulled the seeds from them and made for us a tomato garden on the roof. One day during ramadan he calls me and comes by my house with a sack of potatoes to make iftar to break our fast and i'm sure he didn't have much. He wrote me a beautiful letter by speaking it word for word to a friend of ours so I would have a thank you and goo dbye when i left beirut, he's a sweet heart and his daughter is hadeel and she's so cute. he should stay with his wife, his mom and daughter in dar'ah syria where he can finally rest at peace with his family heritage of being farmers. his father was killed by the assad regiem and he's in charge of bringing resources to his family.\n\nthis is my title:\nKeep Ahmed With His Family and Out of Military Service\n\nAnything better? summarize the story and give me best practices for a gofundme or launchgood project and then write a first draft",

      "content": "Your title \"Keep Ahmed With His Family and Out of Military Service\" is strong and to the point. It clearly states the purpose of the campaign and evokes empathy. However, to make it even more impactful, you might consider a title that emphasizes the emotional aspect of Ahmed's situation. For instance:\n\n\"Help Ahmed Stay Home with His Family, Avoiding Forced Military Service\"\n\nNow, let's move on to summarizing the story and incorporating best practices for a GoFundMe or LaunchGood campaign. \n\n### Best Practices for Crowdfunding Campaigns:\n\n1. **Tell a Compelling Story**: Share Ahmed's journey in a way that connects emotionally with the audience. Highlight his struggles, resilience, and dreams.\n\n2. **Be Transparent and Specific**: Clearly explain how the funds will be used (e.g., paying the exemption fine) and the impact this will have (Ahmed staying with his family).\n\n3. **Use Engaging Visuals**: If possible, include photos of Ahmed, his daughter, and the tomato garden. Visual elements make the story more relatable.\n\n4. **Keep it Concise but Impactful**: While details are important, keep the story concise. Aim to capture attention quickly.\n\n5. **Express Gratitude**: Show appreciation for any support, big or small.\n\n6. **Update Regularly**: Keep donors updated on the progress of the campaign and Ahmed's situation.\n\n### Draft for Crowdfunding Campaign:\n\n#### Title:\n\"Help Ahmed Stay Home with His Family, Avoiding Forced Military Service\"\n\n#### Story:\n\"Meet Ahmed, a heartwarming soul with a green thumb and a heart of gold, whose life has been a testament to resilience and kindness against all odds. I first met Ahmed in Beirut as my neighbor. He was a street kid, shining shoes to make ends meet. Despite the challenges, his spirit never faltered.\n\nWe tried to uplift Ahmed's life in many ways. School didn't work out for him, and when we provided equipment for a small business, the police confiscated them. Through every setback, Ahmed's unwavering spirit shone through.\n\nHis generosity knows no bounds. With just some rotten tomatoes, Ahmed created a beautiful tomato garden on our rooftop. During Ramadan, despite his limited means, he surprised me with a sack of potatoes to prepare iftar - a gesture that touched my heart profoundly.\n\nAhmed's ability to give, even when he has so little, is astonishing. Before I left Beirut, he presented me with a heartfelt letter, dictated word by word to a friend, as a token of gratitude.\n\nNow, Ahmed faces a dire situation. Forced to return to Syria, he risks being conscripted into military service. But there's hope - a $7,000 exemption fine can allow him to stay in Dar'a, Syria, with his wife, adorable daughter Hadeel, and mother. He dreams of living a peaceful life, continuing his family's farming heritage, far from the turmoil he has known all his life.\n\nYour support can make this dream a reality. Help us raise $7,000 to keep Ahmed safe at home with his family, away from the horrors of forced military service. Every contribution, no matter the size, brings Ahmed closer to a life of peace and togetherness.\n\nThank you for your kindness and support. We will provide regular updates on Ahmed's journey and the impact of your generosity. Together, we can make a difference in Ahmed's life.\"\n\n---\n\nThis draft incorporates the key elements of your story and follows crowdfunding best practices. Feel free to modify it to better fit Ahmed's story and your campaign's needs.",

      "content": "Here are some tips for the writing, read them, compare what we have, and respond with a better copy:\nSTART A CAMPAIGN\nBilal’s Avatar\nGUIDELINE\nGuideline to an Awesome\nLaunchGood Campaign\nWant to have an awesome and successful campaign on LaunchGood? We want you to as well!\nAMOUNT\nTYPE\nDURATION\nPITCH\nVIDEO\nGIVING LEVELS\nThe following are the fundamental components of a crowdfunding campaign. If your team is interested in launching a campaign, don’t feel overwhelmed by the list. Need be, our team will coach you through all the components to set you up for the best chances of success.\n\nAmount\n\nIdentify the amount of money that you need to raise. Be realistic of your network and what you can accomplish - it's not a question of how much LaunchGood can raise for you but how much you can raise on LaunchGood.\n\nPerception is very important. If you set your goal at $20,000 and raise $10,000, you could look like a failure even though you raised a lot of money. However if your goal is $7,000 and you raise $10,000 you look like an incredible success! In both cases you raised the same amount, but the perception is very different.\n\nAlso don't forget to anticipate expenses. At a minimum you'll need to add ~3% to cover credit card fees. On top of that you may be giving out perks, for example shipping out t-shirts, that cost money to produce and mail. Do your best to estimate all of those expenses and add it to your goal. On average, we find campaigns should aim for 20% more than they need. So if you need $5,000, set your goal at $6,000.\n\nType of Fundraising\n\nNext you want to identify what type of campaign you want to run, for which there are two options:\n\nPartial Funding: You keep whatever you raise, even if you fall short of your goal\nAll-or-Nothing: You only get money if you hit your goal or surpass it. Otherwise nobody's credit cards are charged and you (and we) don't get anything.\nWe know what you're thinking - why would anyone want to do All-or-Nothing? Sounds stressful, right?\n\nWell, because it's stressful that's why. Campaigns that choose the All-or-Nothing route tend to be 8x more successful in reaching their goal because the stakes are so high it forces you and your supporters to work harder, which means more money.\n\nUltimately, you should choose what's best for your campaign type. For example, if you're raising money to feed the homeless do Partial Funding, because even if you only reach 50% of your goal you can still feed a lot of people. But if you're raising money to make a movie do All-or-Nothing Funding, because if you only get 50% there you aren't stuck with not having enough money but still having a responsibility to supporters.\n\nCampaign Duration\n\nCampaigns around 30 days tend to perform best, but what really matters is when you start and finish your campaign by. 80% of funds are received in the first and last 3 days, so you want to start and finish your campaign strategically.\n\nStart\nBeginning of the week is best, between Monday and Wednesday. Choose a week where you have a lot of free time and can pound the virtual pavement, sending lots of emails, posting to Facebook and Twitter, making phone calls and sending texts.\n\nFinish\nFinishing on Friday tends to work best but again it depends on your schedule. If you work fulltime during the week and the weekend is when you have free time, end on a Sunday night, because you'll need to spend those last 2-3 days working really hard to get people to support.\n\nPitch\n\n\"We relate to you, [O Muhammad], the best of stories in what We have revealed to you of this Qur'an although you were, before it, among the unaware.\" Surat Yusuf, Verse 3\n\nThe pitch is critical - it's your chance to tell everyone what you're doing and why it matters. A great pitch doesn't guarantee success but without it you're guaranteed failure.\n\nThere are 3 keys to a successful pitch:\n\nEmotion\nYour pitch isn't about \"making sense\" and being logical, it's about making an emotional connection. People give from their heart, not their brain. Really focus on why should someone care about your campaign, make them feel excited, intrigued, and inspired. Make it irresistible to support!\n\nLegitimacy\nPeople give money to those they trust. How do you establish legitimacy in your campaign? Be transparent! Get personal and talk about who you and your team are, include pictures, share links to social media pages - remove any doubt that you are a legitimate person, organization or business.\n\nImages & Headers\nPeople have very short attention spans, and most will just scan your pitch looking at the headers and images you use. Make sure to include a picture for every 1 to 2 paragraphs of text and those images should be unique and emotionally appealing (like people). Wherever you can convey thoughts in graphs and images instead of text. For headers, use catchy headers that again are unique and emotional, for example if you are from Detroit and trying to raise money to study Arabic in Doha, instead of \"My Story\" you can say \"From Detroit to Doha\".\n\nVideo\n\nCampaigns with videos tend to raise twice as much as campaigns without videos. Research shows that the most effective videos are under 1 minute, and the first 10 seconds are the most critical - they need to reel in the viewer!\n\nWhat makes for an amazing crowdfunding video pitch?\n\nBe Yourself\nIf you're a funny person, make a funny video. If you're very thoughtful, be thoughtful. Every video is as unique as a fingerprint, so don't worry about trying to copy someone else's. Leave complicated details for your pitch (for example, specific perks for each giving level) and instead focus on building that emotional connection.\n\nIntroduction\nWhat is the purpose of your campaign? Better yet, who are you? The introduction should be brief, but it should answer these fundamental questions. It is recommended that you or your team appear in the video itself as well. Faceless organizations and professionals are sometimes hard to relate to — or even trust. For this reason, if you really want to tell a convincing story, show them who you are.\n\nThe Big Idea\nDon’t stall getting to this point. What do you wish to achieve with your product/idea? Is there a problem that you’ve identified and wish to solve using this product/service? What is special about your campaign? There are many different ways one can take this, but regardless of the approach, be specific and to-the-point. Mysteriousness is a hindrance in most cases.\n\nGiving Levels\nLet your supporters know what their support counts for. If you’ve focused on a problem that your product/service solves, then really drill that point home. Similarly, if you are offering a perk, explain to your supporters what it is.\n\nCall-to-Action\nIf you’ve incorporated all of the other basic components, it’s time to ask something of your audience. If you have been abundantly clear and transparent up until this point, this part will come naturally. Simply, what is it you want your supporters to now do? (hint: SUPPORT & SHARE!)\n\nGiving Levels\n\nGiving levels provide options for supporters to choose from when contributing to your campaign. These can also take your campaign to the next level. There is no ‘ideal’ giving level; each campaign has something different to offer its supporters. Here are some points to consider:\n\nOffer a Full Range\n80% of supporters will give less than $50, but more than half your money will come from big contributions. So you need a full range of small and big giving levels to get everyone involved. For example, you can have $10, $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, $1000, $2500, etc.\n\nPerks vs. Impact\nIf you're making a product, like a music album, it's easy to offer perks that are structured around that product (e.g. $25 gets you a CD). But what if you're part of a non-profit building a mosque? In this case, focus on the impact of the contribution. So for $25 you don't get something, but you're helping pay for 1 square foot of construction.\n\nCost Effective\nMake sure your perks don’t end up costing you more money and headache than they're worth! LaunchGood is a global platform and you can get supporters from San Francisco to Singapore. Think of cool perks that don't require shipping, like listing someone on your website or the credits of your film or engraving their name into a wall if they ever come visit.\n\nIdeas\nStill need some help coming up with ideas?

      "content": "Based on the LaunchGood guidelines you provided and comparing them with our initial draft, here are some improvements that can be made to enhance Ahmed's campaign:\n\n1. **Amount and Goal Setting**: Our initial goal of $7,000 aligns well with LaunchGood's advice of being realistic and anticipating expenses. Considering the additional 20% for unforeseen costs and credit card fees, we could adjust the goal to around $8,400. This higher target also allows for a buffer in case of additional unforeseen expenses.\n\n2. **Type of Fundraising**: Given the nature of Ahmed's situation, Partial Funding seems more appropriate. It ensures that any amount raised will still contribute significantly to his cause, even if the full goal isn’t met.\n\n3. **Campaign Duration**: Aligning with the recommendation, a 30-day campaign duration would be ideal. Starting early in the week and ending on a Friday or Sunday, depending on when we can dedicate the most time to promoting the campaign in its final days.\n\n4. **Pitch Enhancement**: The emotional aspect of Ahmed's story is already strong in our draft. However, we can improve legitimacy by including more personal details, pictures of Ahmed and his family, and links to social media pages or other forms of personal identification. For headers and images, using emotionally appealing visuals like Ahmed with his family or the rooftop tomato garden he created will enhance the impact.\n\n5. **Video**: Although our initial pitch doesn't include a video, it's clear that a short, compelling video could significantly boost the campaign. The video should introduce Ahmed, show his situation, and make a direct emotional appeal. It could also briefly show the rooftop garden or other aspects of his life to create a personal connection.\n\n6. **Giving Levels**: We need to establish clear giving levels. For lower contributions, we could offer updates and personal thank you messages. For higher levels, perhaps a personal letter or a video message from Ahmed could be offered. We should focus on the impact of each contribution level, explaining how each amount helps towards Ahmed’s exemption fee.\n\n7. **Call to Action**: Our current draft could be more direct in its call to action. We should explicitly ask supporters to contribute and share the campaign, emphasizing the urgency and importance of their support.\n\nWith these improvements, Ahmed's campaign will be more aligned with LaunchGood’s best practices, potentially increasing its effectiveness and reach.",

      "content": "Absolutely, let's personalize the campaign narrative to reflect your close relationship with Ahmed and the journey you've shared. Here's a revised version:\n\n---\n\nI first met Ahmed on my doorstep in Beirut, where he was polishing shoes to make ends meet. Over the years, our bond grew beyond friendship; we became like brothers. His generosity, despite having so little, never ceased to amaze me. I remember vividly when he gave me a ring, urging me to propose to my now-wife, Josephine. That's Ahmed – always caring for others before himself.\n\nToday, Ahmed faces a critical challenge. He's been forced to return to Syria and is at risk of compulsory military service. We're rallying to raise $8,400 to pay for his exemption so he can stay with his family. This isn't just about money; it's about securing a safe and stable life for a man who has been a beacon of kindness in the lives of those around him.\n\nAhmed's story is one of resilience and hope. He turned a few rotten tomatoes into a thriving rooftop garden, sharing the harvest with everyone. During Ramadan, he shared his limited food for iftar, embodying the true spirit of community. Ahmed's actions, transcending language and culture, have touched the hearts of all who know him.\n\nYour support means everything. Here's how it can make a difference:\n- $10: Contributes towards the exemption fee, a step closer to keeping Ahmed safe.\n- $25: Helps cover the fees and ensures Ahmed's smooth transition.\n- $50: A significant push towards our goal, keeping Ahmed with his family.\n- $100: A major contribution to securing Ahmed's safety and peace.\n- $250: A powerful statement of support, greatly impacting Ahmed's future.\n\nEvery dollar counts and brings Ahmed closer to a life of peace with his family in Dar'a. Your contribution isn't just a donation; it's a lifeline to a man who has always put others before himself.\n\nThis campaign is deeply personal to me. Ahmed isn't just a friend; he's family. By donating and sharing this campaign, you're not just helping a man avoid forced military service; you're honoring the spirit of a person who's always given so much despite having so little.\n\nLet's come together to make a tangible, lasting difference in Ahmed's life. It's about more than money; it's about solidarity, compassion, and taking care of one of our own. Donate today and help write a hopeful chapter in Ahmed's life.\n\n--- \n\nThis version captures the personal connection and shared experiences between you and Ahmed, making it a more intimate and compelling narrative for your campaign.",

      "content": "Remove \"our bond\" and make it more like I speak. Here's an example of some copy. Ahmed and I got closer over the years and we tried so many things to find stable solutions and while he lived in Lebanon it was never possible. We tried to set him up with coffee equipment to sell coffee and the police took the tools saying that Syrians were not allowed to work. After all these years he's now stuck in syria and facing military service. I'm reaching out first and formost to all the people who knew him from Beit Al Atlas, all the peopl ehe cooked potatoes for, the people he helped paint murals with, the people he helped dig their gardens to connect and help. If you never met Ahmed, and only know me, then your care can flow through me. \nThe idea of beit al atlas was to follow the principle that those closest to us deserve the most of our generosity and that we can build closeness across difference. I never thought I'd have a friend like ahmed, and through me and beit al atlas and all those who Ahmed met there, you now can connect with him too as so many others have. \nI hope we can collect this amount quickly so he can get the exemption soon. I will see if our mutual Syrian/Lebanese friend Saleh can go help me in Syria to make sure there are no problems iwth the transfer and take every care to document and not waste a cent. \nIf we go above this amount we have a few other Syrian refugee friends who are looking to return home and would benefit, Abed, currently in Turkey, and other work on Beit Al Atlas/the new cafe we're establishing on the ground floor. No money will go to waste, so please donate generously. Thank you ",

Here's a revised version of the campaign message that reflects your personal voice and the unique relationship you have with Ahmed:\n\n---\n\nAhmed and I got closer over the years, trying everything we could to find him stable solutions while he was in Lebanon. I remember when we set him up with coffee equipment to sell coffee, but the police confiscated it, saying Syrians weren't allowed to work. Now, he's back in Syria, facing mandatory military service, and I'm reaching out for help.\n\nThis message goes first to everyone who knew Ahmed from Beit Al Atlas, those he cooked potatoes for, helped paint murals, or assisted in gardening. To those who never met Ahmed but know me, your care can flow through my connection with him.\n\nBeit Al Atlas was built on the principle that those closest to us deserve our generosity and that we can build closeness across differences. I never thought I'd find a friend like Ahmed, but he became part of my world. Through Beit Al Atlas and our interactions, many others have connected with him too.\n\nWe're aiming to quickly raise the required amount for Ahmed's exemption. Our mutual Syrian/Lebanese friend Saleh will help in Syria to ensure there are no issues with the transfer. We will document everything meticulously to ensure not a cent is wasted.\n\nIf we exceed our target, the additional funds will support other friends in similar situations, like Abed in Turkey, and contribute to Beit Al Atlas and the new cafe we're setting up. Rest assured, no contribution will go to waste.\n\nPlease donate generously. Your support means more than just financial aid; it's a gesture of solidarity and community, extending a helping hand to a friend who has always been there for others, even when he had little for himself. Thank you for your kindness and willingness to make a difference.\n\n--- \n\nThis version should more accurately reflect your relationship with Ahmed and the nature of your request, using a direct and personal tone.",

      "content": "Finding blood in your stool and experiencing changes in your bowel habits and smell can be concerning and are symptoms that should not be ignored. They can be indicative of various conditions, ranging from relatively benign to more serious. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. **Hemorrhoids**: These are swollen blood vessels in the rectal area and can cause bright red blood in the stool. They're often associated with pain or discomfort during bowel movements.\n\n2. **Gastrointestinal Infections**: Infections, such as those caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites, can lead to bloody stools and changes in the odor of gas. They are often accompanied by other symptoms like abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea.\n\n3. **Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD)**: Conditions like Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis can cause blood in the stool, along with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gas. These are chronic conditions that cause inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n4. **Anal Fissures**: Small tears in the lining of the anus can cause bleeding, especially during bowel movements.\n\n5. **Diverticulitis**: Inflammation or infection of small pouches that can form in your intestines (diverticula) can lead to bleeding, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits.\n\n6. **Gastrointestinal Cancers**: Though less common, colorectal cancer and other forms of gastrointestinal cancer can cause bloody stool and changes in bowel habits. This is more concerning, especially if there is a family history of such cancers or if you are over the age of 50.\n\n7. **Diet and Food Intolerances**: Certain foods and intolerances, such as lactose intolerance, can cause gas, bloating, and changes in the smell of gas. However, they are less likely to cause bloody stools unless there is associated irritation of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nGiven these possibilities, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They may recommend a physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging studies, or a colonoscopy to determine the cause of your symptoms. It's important to address these symptoms promptly, especially if they persist or worsen.",
