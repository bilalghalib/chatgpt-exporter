      "content": "When contractors and clients are creating an agreement for work, there are several types of contracts they might consider, each with its specific purposes and conditions. Here are some common names and types of contracts used in such scenarios:\n\n1. **Service Agreement or Service Contract** - This is a general contract for services that outlines the scope of work, payment terms, duration, and responsibilities of both parties.\n\n2. **Consulting Agreement** - Used specifically for professional consulting services, this details the nature of the consultancy, terms of service, and compensation.\n\n3. **Independent Contractor Agreement** - Suitable for freelancers or independent contractors, this agreement specifies that the worker is not an employee and covers aspects like scope of work, deadlines, and payment.\n\n4. **Project Contract or Project-Based Contract** - Tailored for specific projects, this contract will outline the project details, milestones, deliverables, timelines, and payment schedules.\n\n5. **Retainer Agreement** - Used when a client wants to retain the services of a contractor over a period of time. It specifies the retainer fee, scope of work available under the retainer, and other terms.\n\n6. **Work-for-Hire Agreement** - Often used in creative fields, this specifies that all outputs of the work will be owned by the employer from the start.\n\n7. **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** - While not a work agreement by itself, it's often included as part of a contract to protect confidential information shared during the work.\n\n8. **Master Service Agreement (MSA)** - This outlines the general terms and conditions between the parties, under which specific work (detailed in subsequent statements of work) will be performed.\n\nEach of these contracts can be customized to fit the specific needs and circumstances of the work being contracted. It's always recommended to have legal advice when drafting or signing such agreements to ensure that all legal requirements are met and the interests of both parties are protected.",

To help refine the agreement format and determine an appropriate role title and description, here are five questions to consider:\n\n1. **What specific duties and responsibilities will this new role include?** Understanding the scope of tasks will help in defining the role more clearly and ensuring that the agreement covers all necessary aspects.\n\n2. **Will the role require decision-making authority over certain areas or personnel?** Knowing whether the role includes managerial responsibilities can influence both the title and the terms of the contract, especially concerning liability and authority.\n\n3. **How will the performance of this role be measured?** Identifying key performance indicators or specific milestones can help in structuring the agreement, particularly in terms of performance reviews and potential bonuses or incentives.\n\n4. **What are your expectations regarding availability and working hours?** Clarifying whether this is a full-time role, part-time, or flexible hours will impact the contract terms and the role's title if it includes terms like \"part-time\" or \"flexible.\"\n\n5. **What growth opportunities or advancements can this role potentially offer?** If the role is intended to evolve or if there's scope for promotion, this might influence the title and make the position more attractive, also impacting how the role is described in the contract.\n\nBased on your answers to these questions, we can better tailor the contract type and craft a role title and description that accurately reflects the nature and expectations of the job.",

Based on the information you provided, here's how we can proceed to shape the role and the contractual agreement:\n\n### Role Title and Description\nGiven the variety of tasks and the potential for advancement, a title that suggests versatility and managerial potential would be fitting.

      "content": "I'd say they can be the assisstant operations manager with the progression towards becoming the operations manager and then the COO\nI I have this content, can you take it and reformat it into an agreement? Q&A - Career Clarity\n\nWill I be considered a permanent employee or a freelancer if work as a full-timer?\nBilal: A contractor working towards a permanent employee once Nur makes enough money consistently so we are sure we can hire you full time long term. For now it’s a 6 month contract. \nNilam: Alright clear\nIs it fine if I’ll create an agreement for this position? Or will you probably make an official agreement letter that we both need to sign?\nBilal: Yes absolutely, that’s an Islamic requirement\t\nNilam: Okay\nIf I work as a full-timer, will I be under the company or an individual on paper?\nBilal: You will be a contractor as an individual, I don’t understand this question\nNilam: Never mind, but I got it\nWhat will be my responsibilities in this role? I have some responsibilities right now, such as assisting Bilal, Nur Creative Studio, Bloom, etc. Do you have an outline for the responsibilities? \nBilal: That will be specified in this contract. Right now The tasks will be centered around making sure to get Nur to becoming profitable. To do this you will become a sort of “operations” person identifying problems and finding solutions. For instance you will probably hire upworkers to help us design things and to have you put them on social media, or even hire a social media expert to design our social media outreach and then your role might be to implement it. You don’t need to know everything, in this job you will either take time to learn things, find a mentor/coach, or hire someone. \nNilam: \nIf in Indonesia, I work Monday to Friday. If we work together, is it flexible or will you allow one or two days off every week? \nBilal: Nilam you don’t need to do everything I say when I say it. We need a system where you can put what I say and then sort/rank them and then ask me which do I think is most important to do right now. \nNilam: I think, that is what I said, Bilal. To put based on priority haha\nYou offered me USD$650, is it included for all or separated as part-timers? As you said much earlier, I work with you as a full-timer but also for Bilal at different hours rate\nBilal: I don’t understand - it’s what I can pay for fulltime for now per month. It would be sent wire transfer from my business account and you would submit a monthly bill as a contractor with your services and I pay for them. \nNilam:\nYou offered me USD$650, since I haven’t been calculated with tax etc. Are you open to negotiating? Plus, is it USD or Euros? :D\nBilal: Yes, negotiating is fine. Except I don’t prefer to think of it like that - I think of it like this, here’s what I can possibly do, what do you need and I can see if I can switch things up to make you feel free and happy. Honestly 700 is probably ok since Nur is now making about 1500ish each month and 1/3rd is profit, although I will also take a salary soon I believe. Also, work with me to turn on a few more sources of income and we can both rest easy, haha!\nNilam: It’s interesting actually. Because I just did a calculation with what I need and I’ll spend.\n- To be honest, as a full-timer right now + part-timer as your assistant, in a month I can get around $710. But, I have some considerations about it.\n- I did calculation of how much money I’ll spend in a month. Included insurances. It costs around $57\n- I want to propose in the first and second months I work, the salary is $700. After that, you can review it with the condition of Nur and else\n- And the rest of the months, 3rd - 6th, I propose for $780. Why? I know you want this business for good and can collaborate with me for longer than 6 months. But since you keep mentioning 6 months first and it’s something uncertain for me, the excess money from my salary in the 3rd - 6th months will become my emergency fund. In case, we can’t do further collaboration (Even though I really hope we can, insha Allah)\nBilal: \nWill there be a need to travel for business, and how is it arranged?\nBilal: Yes! I would like your help in sourcing! If you are excited about that, otherwise I’ll hire someone else. We have some money in NCS’s bank for product research and ordering new oils. I would like to get wood and oil from Indonesia and I think this is an easy one for you. MAYBE WE DO IT TOGETHER?! oOOOh!\nNilam: It sounds freaking good. I’m excited but seems I need a guide when do that for the first time. So better do together\nAre there any compensations or additional facilities available for business travel? Maybe like reimbursement or cash in advance?\nBilal: Yes, I would make a budget for the project and send it in advance. \nNilam:\nWhat is the schedule for salary payments?\nBilal: This is for the contract, I’d say first of the month or first friday of the month?\t\nNilam:\nIs there a direct payroll system or specific payment methods expected? Or do I need to make an invoice for every time paid day?\nBilal: No payroll. It’s just you. ;D! So what we’d do is I’d set up a recurring payment and then you would still send an invoice every month. I think we can decide like this, we keep the recurring payment for the 7th of the month and you send the invoice on the first. \nNilam:\nCan this 6-month contract be extended if my performance is satisfactory?\nBilal: Yes that is absolutely the goal! We may grow at some point and need to switch roles accordingly yet I do hope you become great at operations - unless there’s another role you’d like\nNilam:\nIs there a possibility to extend the contract after the 6 months ends, and what are the requirements or processes?\nBilal: We will have our own one-on-one sessions where I tell you honestly what you’re doing well and where you can grow. You forget I co-founded and am a trainer for entrepreneurs so I will use all the methodologies I use to train and teach people how to run and manage programs with you, get ready? :)?\t\nNilam:\nWill the decision to extend the contract be based on performance or business needs?\nBilal: Decision will be based on performance and the ability for the company to hire you financially\nNilam:\nAs you know I’m concerned about long-term and stability. Are there any long-term plans for this role after the 6-month contract ends?\nBilal: did you write this question with AI, haha! Ok, the long-term plans are for it to continue insha’allah and to have the resources to give you a raise, although it’s not 100% certain. The other potential is to transform the business into a coop and involve you more deeply as a partner int he coop benefitting from potential profit (that’s assuming the business is profitable and doing well) My goal is to use this business for good Nilam\nNilam:\nHow does Bilal plan to develop or modify this role in the future?\nBilal: You totally used AI. That’s why you gave me too many questions, you’re not using the framework I shared with you! Haha, make 20 questions and pick the most important 7 that cover the maximum number of ideas with the minimum number of questions (save this prompt ;D)\nAnswer: the role will change as the business changes, currently the closest role is operations and it’s likely to remain that in 6 months. If you grow and or find yourself leaning towards product development and want to grow in that direction we can consider it. \nNilam: Ok, I’ll save the prompt haha!\nIf suddenly from your side have to terminate the collaboration with me before 6 months, how do you handle it, and what actions do you take?\nBilal: Oh, well I don’t intend to do that at all. I guess I will promise the 6 month payments no matter what, so if Nur is shut down, you can focus on the other assistant role tasks that we are doing.\nNilam:\nJust in case, if I eventually refuse to become a full-timer, what would you do? Will the freelance contract end or do you have other plans?\nBilal: If you don’t want to continue after the 6 month contract you should let me know as soon as you start to feel that way so I can have you help me find and train your replacement, perhaps with a 1 to two month overlap insha’allah\nNilam: No, I mean if I refuse this offer for 6 months. What is your plan to me?\nBilal: oooh I see - I guess I’ll work with you to find someone over the months grow into a full time role and perhaps reduce hours to be more focused on general assistant tasks like tickets and bookings etc - I didn’t actually think about it yet. For me I want a teammmate \n\n\n\n13 April 2024: Bilal sent voice notes that containing:\nBilal discusses his need for assistance in managing the workload and finances, indicating a potential interest in working with Nilam more long-term. Bilal mention receiving an offer of support from a previous virtual assistant and considering taking it. At the end Nilam can take over all\nNeed for deeper assistance in managing workload, finances, and strategic planning.\nDesire to stop overspending on unnecessary freelancers and develop better budgeting habits.\nSeeking coaching and support for prioritization, strategic planning, and time management.\nRecognizing past mistakes in project prioritization and spending decisions.\nConsidering utilizing a $2,000 line of credit from a previous virtual assistant for additional support.\nWillingness to involve the recipient in decision-making regarding support option\n\n\nAnd here are my response:\n\nMy feelings are mixed feelings, to be honest.\nHow many times have you offered me to work full-time? Since I was confused until I believed it would be the right decision for me, for you, after we have been practicing istikhara. I do really want, Bilal. \nYou gave me a lot of knowledge, Masha Allah. But, half of mine sometimes feel insecure, even. I have never been working with someone like you, not about the add things. I mean in general as a personal assistant, and you are my first client. I have so much lack of knowledge here and there since day 1 even until now. I'm a typical person who just do things and barely says something else. \n\nBut, I know, you can't always excuse me for this reason. I just feel so much better at this moment if compared to the day 1 I started to work with you. \n\nOh just remember why do I feel insecure most of the time? One of triggers is every time you delegate a task and I just start to understand more, you say \"Don't take it too long\" or something like that. I just feel you don't believe me. \n\nI know you always keep in rush in everything, but you need to slow down for some parts. I think it's just that we have different ways to work. Where you already have a lot of experience, but me, it's like a newbie. I realized a lot of things I delivered didn't meet your expectations. I just know some tools from you like airtable, softr, how to prompt on chatgpt, and anything else. Obviously, I open the feedback, which part I can improve, which part I'm already good at, or else. Like you did a few weeks ago, and it was like my wake-up call. So, thank you so much. \n\nI'm still excited to start the journey with you, to start new experiences with you, to be involved in many projects and tools, and everything. Still curious how I can help you enough with my maximum limit to organize you. Definitely for my skills and knowledge. I already proposed a way to organize your stuff daily, but I believe you want more than that, to be more organized and clear flow. Idk your previous VA offered you credits of support, I mean how it looks like until you sent the email to me. It's good a sign, but it's not cheap. But, Hi Nilam 😀I think I better see the email first. Okay!\n\n\nAgain, I'm happy to know you, seriously from the deepest of my heart. You are the most kind-hearted person ever I met, wallahi, Bilal. You appreciate my little things as well, which is very rare nowadays. I'm happy to learn a lot from you, you always share your ability and knowledge, and without you realizing it, your rewards continue to pour, Insha Allah. The point is I don't think we need a coach if we have materials to fix our flow from your previous VA, definitely, if it's worth it. If it's not, maybe we can consider finding someone like project management who is more affordable.\n\nOther than that, like I told you, I need to submit my resignation and it's 2 months' notice. Previously you said fine waiting for it, but if you have concerns, just let me know. But, I hope you can understand it :)\n\nOh want to reminder: last week you have ideation about to creating entrepreneur bootcamp for master students. It’s related to your skills and knowledge and also can get extra income for us. The requirement is I need to attend at least 2 hours in every Saturday and this is mandatory\n",
