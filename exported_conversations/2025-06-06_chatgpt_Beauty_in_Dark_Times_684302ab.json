      "content": "Here are several quotes and sayings that reflect the spirit of *holding on to beauty in dark times* or *carrying a candle in your heart* through difficulty. Some are direct, others metaphorical — drawing on the imagery of light, inner resilience, and the role of beauty or goodness amid suffering:\n\n---\n\n### 🌒 **Quotes About Beauty, Light, and Inner Resilience in Darkness**\n\n1. **\"In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.\"**  \n   — *Albert Camus*\n\n2. **\"Even a single candle defies the darkness.\"**  \n   — *Jewish proverb*\n\n3. **\"Ring the bells that still can ring / Forget your perfect offering / There is a crack in everything / That’s how the light gets in.\"**  \n   — *Leonard Cohen*, *Anthem*\n\n4. **\"Be like a candle which burns itself but gives light to others.\"**  \n   — *Rumi*\n\n5. **\"You do not have to be good. You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.\"**  \n   — *Mary Oliver*, from *Wild Geese* (not directly about darkness, but about inner grace)\n\n6. **\"Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness.\"**  \n   — *Desmond Tutu*\n\n7. **\"Beauty will save the world.\"**  \n   — *Fyodor Dostoevsky* (interpreted often from *The Idiot*)\n\n8. **\"Do not lose heart. We were made for these times.\"**  \n   — *Clarissa Pinkola Estés*, from her essay *We Were Made for These Times*:  \n   *“One of the most calming and powerful actions you can do to intervene in a stormy world is to stand up and show your soul. Soul on deck shines like gold in dark times.”*\n\n9. **\"And when the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language... even the phrase each other — doesn’t make any sense.\"**  \n   — *Rumi*, again reminding us of a deeper unity beneath appearances.\n\n10. **\"Carry a candle. Be a light in the darkness. Radiate warmth, not heat. Let your life be a quiet protest of beauty.\"**  \n   — *(Paraphrase/modern spiritual maxim; source unknown)*\n\n---\n\nWould you like these tailored for a poster, talk, or reflective writing? Or paired with Islamic, poetic, or mystic traditions?",
