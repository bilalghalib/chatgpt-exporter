It consists of nine sections: Key Partners, Key Activities, Key Resources, Value Propositions, Customer Relationships, Channels, Customer Segments, Cost Structure, and Revenue Streams.\n\nTo facilitate filling out each section of the BMC, I'll provide you with a series of prompts that you can use. These prompts are designed to guide your thinking and help you extract relevant information. For each section, you can send these prompts to a large language model (LLM) to help generate specific questions or insights.\n\n1. **Key Partners**\n   - Prompt: \"What are the essential partnerships that my business relies on or needs to establish? Consider suppliers, manufacturers, business partners, strategic alliances, and stakeholders.\"\n\n2. **Key Activities**\n   - Prompt: \"What are the most important activities required to deliver my product/service? Think about production, problem-solving, platform/marketplace management, and other core activities.\"\n\n3. **Key Resources**\n   - Prompt: \"Identify the key resources needed to make the business model work. These can include physical assets, intellectual property, human resources, and financial resources.\"\n\n4. **Value Propositions**\n   - Prompt: \"What unique value do I provide to my customers? Consider what problem I'm solving, the needs I'm meeting, and why customers would choose my product/service over competitors.\"\n\n5. **Customer Relationships**\n   - Prompt: \"How do I plan to build and maintain relationships with my customers? Think about personal assistance, automated services, communities, self-service, and co-creation.\"\n\n6. **Channels**\n   - Prompt: \"Through which channels do I reach my customer segments to deliver my value proposition? Consider direct and indirect channels, online and offline channels.\"\n\n7. **Customer Segments**\n   - Prompt: \"Who are my target customers? Identify different segments based on demographics, behaviors, needs, and the value they seek from my product/service.\"\n\n8. **Cost Structure**\n   - Prompt: \"What are the major cost drivers in my business model? Think about fixed costs, variable costs, economies of scale, and economies of scope.\"\n\n9. **Revenue Streams**\n   - Prompt: \"How does the business generate revenue? Explore different revenue models like direct sales, subscription fees, licensing, advertising, and freemium models.\"\n\nYou can use these prompts to guide your thinking and discussions. Remember, the Business Model Canvas is a dynamic tool, so feel free to iterate and update it as your understanding of your business evolves.",

Who are you solving the problem for?\n\n3. **Unique Value Proposition**\n   - Determine your unique value proposition. What is the clear, compelling message that states why you are different and worth buying?\n\n4. **Solution**\n   - Outline the top three features of your product or service that solve the identified problems.\n\n5. **Unfair Advantage**\n   - Consider what gives you an edge that cannot be easily copied or bought by competitors.\n\n6. **Revenue Streams**\n   - Describe your revenue model, lifetime value of a customer, revenue, and gross margin.\n\n7. **Cost Structure**\n   - List your customer acquisition costs, distributing costs, hosting, personnel, and other significant expenses.\n\n8. **Key Metrics**\n   - Decide on the key activities you will measure to assess the performance of your business.\n\n9. **Channels**\n   - Plan your path to customers. How will you reach your customer segments to deliver your value proposition?\n\nApproaching the Business Model Canvas in this order helps to ensure that each section builds on the information and decisions made in the previous sections, leading to a more coherent and effective business model.",
