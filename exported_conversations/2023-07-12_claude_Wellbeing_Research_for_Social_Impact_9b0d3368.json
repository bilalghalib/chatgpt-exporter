      "content": "Here are some key points about wellbeing and avoiding burnout for people working in social impact roles:\n\n- Burnout is common in helping professions like social work and activism. Being exposed to others' trauma and trying to solve large systemic issues can be emotionally exhausting. \n\n- Self-care is essential. Make sure to take time for activities that recharge you, whether that's exercising, spending time in nature, reading, or just relaxing with friends. Don't feel guilty about taking breaks.\n\n- Set boundaries and learn to say no when needed. Be realistic about how much you can take on without becoming overwhelmed.\n\n- Build a support system. Connect regularly with colleagues, mentors, friends and family who understand the nature of your work. Feel free to confide struggles.  \n\n- Monitor yourself for signs of burnout like exhaustion, cynicism, irritability, or lack of productivity. If they persist, you may need a bigger intervention like a vacation or sabbatical.\n\n- Consider joining a support group, or seeking counseling if you are struggling with vicarious trauma from the issues you work on daily.Taking care of yourself benefits your clients too.\n\n- Advocate for organizational change if your workplace culture contributes to burnout. Suggest reasonable workloads, flexibility, and self-care days. A unhealthy work environment affects everyone.\n\nThe key is sustainability - pacing yourself and prioritizing self-care so you can keep doing meaningful work without sacrificing your health. Let me know if you need any other tips for your workshop!",

      "content": "Great, here's some more information:\n\nBonjour, this is Bing. I’m happy to help you with your workshop.😊\n\nWellbeing for social impact is a topic that relates to how people can develop and maintain positive interactions with other people and with local and global communities, and how this can improve their personal wellbeing and social contribution. There are different types of social wellbeing, such as interpersonal, communal, and societal wellbeing, and they can be influenced by various factors, such as social support, social capital, social identity, social justice, and social responsibility12.\n\nOne of the challenges that people who work in NGOs or social enterprises face is the risk of burnout, which is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by chronic stress. Burnout can affect not only the individual’s health and wellbeing, but also their performance and motivation in their work. Therefore, it is important to prevent and cope with burnout by engaging in self-care practices that can enhance resilience and well-being1.\n\nSelf-care practices are activities that people do to take care of their own needs and well-being, such as physical exercise, relaxation, hobbies, socializing, etc. Self-care practices can vary depending on the person’s preferences, resources, and context. However, some general benefits of self-care practices are that they can reduce stress, improve mood, boost energy, increase self-esteem, and enhance coping skills1.\n\nThe statistic that you mentioned about exercise being the top self-care activity reducing emotional exhaustion in social workers comes from a study by Blomberg et al., 20223. The study was conducted in Sweden and involved 1,113 social workers who completed a survey on their burnout levels and self-care activities. The study found that exercise was the most frequently reported self-care activity among the participants, followed by spending time with family or friends, hobbies or interests, relaxation or meditation, and reading or watching TV. The study also found that exercise was negatively associated with emotional exhaustion, meaning that the more exercise the participants did, the lower their emotional exhaustion was. The study concluded that exercise can be an effective self-care strategy to prevent and reduce burnout in social workers.\n\nHowever, exercise is not the only self-care activity that can have positive effects on wellbeing and burnout. Other studies have suggested that different types of self-care activities can have different benefits for different aspects of wellbeing and burnout. For example:\n\n*   Relaxation or meditation can reduce stress and anxiety, improve sleep quality, lower blood pressure, and enhance immune system function45.\n    \n*   Hobbies or interests can provide enjoyment, satisfaction, creativity, learning opportunities, and a sense of identity .\n    \n*   Spending time with family or friends can increase social support, belongingness, trust, empathy, and happiness .\n    \n*   Reading or watching TV can provide entertainment, distraction, information, inspiration, and cognitive stimulation .\n    \n\nTherefore, it is important to encourage people to find self-care activities that suit their needs and preferences, and to make time for them regularly. Some tips to help people develop self-care habits are:\n\n*   Set realistic and specific goals for self-care activities (e.g., I will exercise for 30 minutes three times a week).\n    \n*   Schedule self-care activities in advance and treat them as important appointments.\n    \n*   Find a self-care buddy who can join you in your activities or hold you accountable.\n    \n*   Track your progress and reward yourself for your achievements.\n    \n*   Be flexible and adaptable if your plans change or if you encounter obstacles.\n    \n*   Be kind and compassionate to yourself if you miss a session or if you feel guilty about taking time for yourself.\n    \n\nI hope this information is helpful for your workshop. If you need more information or assistance on this topic or any other topic related to wellbeing for social impact, please let me know. I’m here to help.😊\n\n3: Blomberg et al., 2022.

Preventing it should be a priority. \n\n- Emphasize that self-care is not selfish - it's key to sustainability and impact. Framing it as an ethical obligation.\n\nActivities:\n- Have participants reflect on what self-care means to them. What replenishes their energy? \n\n- Do a values assessment - how much time/priority do they currently give to self-care vs other duties? Is this balance sustainable?\n\n- Have them set 1-3 specific self-care goals for the next month. Get an accountability partner.\n\n- Practice mindfulness or breathing exercises. Discuss benefits for stress.\n\n- If possible, take a group walk outdoors. Discuss benefits of exercise. \n\nDiscussion:\n- Share research on different self-care benefits - social, cognitive, physical, emotional. \n\n- Discuss barriers to self-care and how to overcome them. Normalize occasional struggles.\n\n- Share stories of burnout recovery through sabbaticals, counseling, or lifestyle change.\n\n- Have participants share their biggest self-care lessons and peer advice. \n\nTakeaways:\n- Summarize key statistics again and the multitude of self-care benefits.\n\n- Encourage people to be patient but persistent in making self-care an ongoing habit.\n\n- Appreciate participants for taking steps to protect their wellbeing and capacity for purpose.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to expand on any part of the workshop plan outline! I'm happy to provide more details or customize it further based on your needs. The key is making self-care engaging while emphasizing its critical importance.",

            "text": "Here are some suggestions for incorporating the key information into your workshop on wellbeing for social impact:\n\nIntroduction:\n- Note the high statistics on burnout (75% of social workers, 50% of activists) to highlight the need for greater focus on self-care.\n\n- Explain how burnout harms individuals, organizations, and mission delivery. Preventing it should be a priority. \n\n- Emphasize that self-care is not selfish - it's key to sustainability and impact. Framing it as an ethical obligation.\n\nActivities:\n- Have participants reflect on what self-care means to them. What replenishes their energy? \n\n- Do a values assessment - how much time/priority do they currently give to self-care vs other duties? Is this balance sustainable?\n\n- Have them set 1-3 specific self-care goals for the next month. Get an accountability partner.\n\n- Practice mindfulness or breathing exercises. Discuss benefits for stress.\n\n- If possible, take a group walk outdoors. Discuss benefits of exercise. \n\nDiscussion:\n- Share research on different self-care benefits - social, cognitive, physical, emotional. \n\n- Discuss barriers to self-care and how to overcome them. Normalize occasional struggles.\n\n- Share stories of burnout recovery through sabbaticals, counseling, or lifestyle change.\n\n- Have participants share their biggest self-care lessons and peer advice. \n\nTakeaways:\n- Summarize key statistics again and the multitude of self-care benefits.\n\n- Encourage people to be patient but persistent in making self-care an ongoing habit.\n\n- Appreciate participants for taking steps to protect their wellbeing and capacity for purpose.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to expand on any part of the workshop plan outline! I'm happy to provide more details or customize it further based on your needs. The key is making self-care engaging while emphasizing its critical importance.",

If there’s room for improvement, we are here to help. Adjusting to the virtual landscape can be a doozy if you don’t have the correct tools and processes–especially if remote work is new to your business dynamic. But you can have productive and effective remote meetings with properly executed virtual facilitation. The following five virtual facilitation strategies are high-level ways to encourage remote team engagement, provide optimal support for attendees, and achieve meaningful results.\n\n**1\\. Turn on your camera**\n---------------------------\n\nEncourage all meeting attendees to use their cameras. Collaborating virtually already threatens team connection; it’s simply not the same dynamic as being together in the same physical space. You lose the necessary human connection imperative to having meaningful meetings when your team can’t see each other’s faces. When you do not enforce the use of video, you are inviting participants to multi-task with non-related material and you’ll lose their attention.\n\n> Partial attention does not foster productive meetings, it fuels unproductive ones.\n\nEncourage all participants to turn on their cameras during virtual meetings.\n\n**2\\. Learn by doing**\n----------------------\n\nThe best teacher is experience. Make your meetings interactive. This will not only keep people engaged, but it will also help with retention and a sense of ownership. Use a collaborative virtual space like MURAL–a virtual whiteboard tool–or simply use Google Docs to allow team members to engage and work together in real-time. Sitting and staring at a screen, while someone talks at you, is not nearly as enticing and inspiring as getting your hands dirty. You should do the work in the meeting, not after, to achieve the best outcome. Make meetings productive working sessions by getting the entire team involved. This will help you attain meaningful results. \n\nVirtual whiteboard tools like MURAL allow remote teams to work together in real-time using interactive templates and digital stickie notes.\n\n> Pro tip: Assign a scribe to document important meeting notes, capture room intelligence, and synthesize information during the meeting. It is helpful to have a designated person focused on recording big themes and takeaways. \n\n**3\\. Piecemeal information** \n------------------------------\n\nTo uphold optimum productivity during virtual meetings, be wary of inflicting cognitive overload on attendees. **The virtual landscape is a new frontier.**Therefore, you need a new process of facilitation that best serves team members in a virtual space. Develop a process that makes it easy to instruct attendees and give them what they need to succeed.\n\n> It takes much more intentional prep-work to run successful virtual meetings.\n\nFor example, if you’re giving instructions to the group, provide it verbally on video as well as visually in the video platform’s chatbox. Sometimes information goes over peoples’ heads, especially with the many outside distractions that come with remote work. Provide instructions in various ways incrementally, rather than all at once, to help ensure all attendees retain them and follow them correctly. \n\nUtilize video platforms’ chat boxes to share instructions and important information with meeting attendees.\n\n**4\\. Provide necessary support**\n---------------------------------\n\nA key component of virtual facilitation is helping attendees understand technicalities specific to the tools you are using. Make sure everyone understands how to use the features of the video conference platform you are meeting on and any other tools they will need.\n\n> Pro tip: send all attendees a list of the tools they will need and how to use them along with a meeting agenda before the meeting so they know what to expect. You can also designate some time at the beginning of the meeting to explain the tools, how they work, and answer any questions. When everyone is on the same page, the meeting will run smoothly. \n\nIf you are using breakout rooms in your meeting, it is helpful to have a facilitator in each breakout room to answer any questions that may arise. If this isn’t possible, make sure to give team members instructions on how to use the help button in the breakout room. Just like a flight attendant call light in an airplane, the facilitator will be notified they are needed in the room when the button is pushed.\n\n**5\\. Use the “raise hand” feature**\n------------------------------------\n\nHave you been in a virtual meeting and felt like you couldn’t get a word in? It can be tough to know when to contribute and how to do so respectfully in a virtual space. The “raise hand” feature in Zoom is a great tool to surpass this roadblock. Ask people to use the button when they want to be called on. It is a clear indicator of desired speaking space and it prevents multiple people from talking at once.

Without equal participation across the board, you are not leveraging the collective intellect, i.e. you are failing to capture room intelligence, and therefore capping the potential for optimal productivity. How do you make sure that every team member is participating in a meaningful way, especially when you’re not in the same room? **Incorporating Liberating Structures into remote team collaboration will optimize communication and improves attention management.** Let’s dive into what Liberating Structures are and how to use them for your remote team.\n\n**What They Are**\n-----------------\n\nLiberating Structures is a framework for facilitation created by Henri Lipmanowicz and Keith McCandless. It consists of 33 microstructures designed to build trust and enhance cooperation and communication between teammates. Participation is the name of the game with Liberating Structures; this framework is built around improving coordination by including and unleashing all participants.\n\nEach microstructure is easy to learn, so whether you’re a highly experienced leader in a long-standing executive role or a fresh-faced newbie at a grassroots organization, this framework can work for you (with a little practice).\n\n**How Liberating Structures Optimize Remote Teams Communication**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEven in person, conventional facilitation structures can be creativity’s worst enemy. They frequently result in the exclusion of less out-spoken voices in the room, lack a solid method of organization, and discourage outside-the-box thinking. Who feels included and creatively encouraged during a 25-minute PowerPoint presentationfollowed by an unfacilitated brainstorm in which the two highest-positioned extroverts in the room do all the talking? (Probably the two highest-positioned extroverts doing all of the talking!)\n\n**The pitfalls of conventional facilitation structures only grow deeper when applied to remote meetings.** Throwing old behaviors online without regard to the unique challenges of virtual facilitation and participation will lead to apathy and frustration for both you and your team. Remote participants face more distractions, technical difficulties, and slower communication than in-person participants. Even the best of us can find ourselves disengaging from virtual meetings or workshops. You’ll need to put extra thought into engagement and participation to make the most of remote communication.\n\nThis is why Liberating Structures is such a great framework for remote teams. The framework’s strengths–participation enhancement, creative empowerment, and cooperation improvement–directly combat the challenges of gathering remotely.\n\nWhen everyone in the room is empowered to participate, your meetings will produce more and better-quality work. Your participants are invited because they have something of value to offer; it is therefore crucial to empower them to contribute. Cooperation between teammates will heighten individual creativity by allowing everyone to build off of and inspire each other. The room is smarter than any individual.\n\n> Liberating Structures can help you harness room intelligence by empowering participants to share and fostering cooperation between team members.\n\nThe framework’s focus on participation will make attention management–often a Herculean task in remote gatherings–significantly easier. Liberating Structures operates under the philosophy that every participant has a lot to contribute, which means that every participant is being asked to take an active role. Participants who are actively engaging are much less likely to check out or become distracted.\n\n**Examples of Liberating Structures**\n-------------------------------------\n\nWhile we love all Liberating Structures activities, we understand that jumping headfirst into adapting 33 microstructures for remote work can be overwhelming. Here are a few activities that are easily applicable for remote meetings to get you started.\n\n### **_Troika Consulting_**\n\nThis activity allows an opportunity for two participants to become consultants for a third group member (the “client.”) The first client shares a question or challenge, then the consultant has 1-2 minutes to ask clarifying questions. When time is up or the consultants are finished asking questions, the client will mute their audio and allow the consultants to spend 4-5 minutes generating suggestions and advice. The consultants will then have 1-2 minutes to share their most valuable feedback to the client. Group members will then switch roles and repeat until every group member has had a chance to be the client.\n\nWe love this activity because it simultaneously gives participants a chance to share their respective strengths and domain of knowledge and builds participants’ confidence in asking for help. The Troika Consulting activity builds trust between teammates and helps participants better understand each other’s strengths and areas of expertise.\n\n**Start our Magical Meetings course today!**\n--------------------------------------------\n\nLearn the methods to make your meetings magical.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nGet Started\n\nBecause this activity requires each participant to step into the role of the expert, it leaves little room for participants to take a backseat. This makes it a good activity for remote facilitations. Even if a participant becomes distracted during their client waiting period, it won’t be long before they’re asked to take on the role of consultant and work with their partner to assist the next group member.\n\n### **_Conversation Café_**\n\nThis is a longer activity that will both make group discussion more structured and train participants to strike an appropriate balance between talking and listening. Participants will break into small groups (5-7 participants); one participant from each group will act as The Host, whose responsibility (in addition to participating in the activity) is to step in when another participant isn’t following one of six agreements.\n\nLiberating Structures‘ Conversation Cafe agreements and steps.\n\nWithin these groups, team members will move through four rounds of conversation. During the first round, each small group member will have one straight minute to share their thoughts or feelings regarding the given conversation topic. After everyone has shared, the second round will begin; small group members will each get another straight minute to share their thoughts and feelings after having listened to what others’ had to say. Traditionally a “talking object” is passed around to signify whose turn it is to speak. Since your team is remote, you will have to find another ritual for signifying who is the speaker. Perhaps everyone else mutes their microphones, or each participant is asked (ahead of time!) to bring a common household item to the meeting, such as a mug or a spatula, to hold up in place of one singular talking object.\n\nThe third round is an open conversation in which participants can speak when they wish rather than taking turns. You may choose to continue using your talking object substitutes or to leave them in round two. This is likely where The Host will need to step in the most; ask them to encourage quieter members to talk and over-sharers to leave space for them to do so. After the third round is over (20-40 minutes), the fourth and final round will give each member a moment to share their biggest takeaways from the previous three rounds of conversation (reintroduce the talking object in this round if you removed it for round 3).\n\n> This activity is great for remote teams because it requires listening and reflecting rather than just sharing.\n\nParticipants will be unable to succeed in rounds 2 or 4 if they check out or get distracted during rounds 1 or 3. It also helps the quieter or more camera-shy participants build confidence contributing during virtual conversation.\n\nIf your virtual meeting requires an open discussion section, using Conversation Café rather than jumping straight into an open discussion will produce better conversation. Because the activity moves through four different rounds with clearly defined prompts and expectations, participants’ attention spans will be more solid and better focused on the discussion at hand. The small groups make it harder for a participant to fade into the background and the use of The Hosts within the groups provides peer-to-peer accountability that will keep everyone engaged.\n\n### **_15% Solutions_**\n\nThe 15% Solutions activity gives participants freedom to chisel away at a problem bit-by-bit rather than attack a huge challenge all at once. This activity can help them find a starting point if you have a question or challenge to work through during your meeting that is so large that team members are feeling blocked or powerless.\n\nTraditionally, participants are asked to break into groups of 2-4–however, remote teams can break into groups that are a little bit larger if they utilize a chat storm. Ask your group what their 15% solution is; what contribution can they make with the power and resources already available to them without the pressure of solving the entire problem at hand? Give participants about 5 minutes to think (maybe an extra minute or two for typing) and then have everyone press enter, sharing their 15% solutions at the same time. Once everyone has had time to read through each other’s responses, provide 5-7 minutes per small group member to ask each other questions and offer feedback.\n\nWe love this activity for remote facilitation because it captures the room intelligence in such a direct way. It harnesses the individual strength of each participant and then requires team members to contribute those strengths to the ideas of others to make them stronger, more well-rounded, and more complete. It’s easy for members of a remote team to feel alone when overwhelmed by a large challenge; this activity brings participants together to improve each other’s ideas and face challenges as a team.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about Mastering Virtual Liberating Structures to assist with your remote team collaboration, join our workshop during Mural Imagine on August 19 + 20. \n\n* * *",

If there’s room for improvement, we are here to help. Adjusting to the virtual landscape can be a doozy if you don’t have the correct tools and processes–especially if remote work is new to your business dynamic. But you can have productive and effective remote meetings with properly executed virtual facilitation. The following five virtual facilitation strategies are high-level ways to encourage remote team engagement, provide optimal support for attendees, and achieve meaningful results.\n\n**1\\. Turn on your camera**\n---------------------------\n\nEncourage all meeting attendees to use their cameras. Collaborating virtually already threatens team connection; it’s simply not the same dynamic as being together in the same physical space. You lose the necessary human connection imperative to having meaningful meetings when your team can’t see each other’s faces. When you do not enforce the use of video, you are inviting participants to multi-task with non-related material and you’ll lose their attention.\n\n> Partial attention does not foster productive meetings, it fuels unproductive ones.\n\nEncourage all participants to turn on their cameras during virtual meetings.\n\n**2\\. Learn by doing**\n----------------------\n\nThe best teacher is experience. Make your meetings interactive. This will not only keep people engaged, but it will also help with retention and a sense of ownership. Use a collaborative virtual space like MURAL–a virtual whiteboard tool–or simply use Google Docs to allow team members to engage and work together in real-time. Sitting and staring at a screen, while someone talks at you, is not nearly as enticing and inspiring as getting your hands dirty. You should do the work in the meeting, not after, to achieve the best outcome. Make meetings productive working sessions by getting the entire team involved. This will help you attain meaningful results. \n\nVirtual whiteboard tools like MURAL allow remote teams to work together in real-time using interactive templates and digital stickie notes.\n\n> Pro tip: Assign a scribe to document important meeting notes, capture room intelligence, and synthesize information during the meeting. It is helpful to have a designated person focused on recording big themes and takeaways. \n\n**3\\. Piecemeal information** \n------------------------------\n\nTo uphold optimum productivity during virtual meetings, be wary of inflicting cognitive overload on attendees. **The virtual landscape is a new frontier.**Therefore, you need a new process of facilitation that best serves team members in a virtual space. Develop a process that makes it easy to instruct attendees and give them what they need to succeed.\n\n> It takes much more intentional prep-work to run successful virtual meetings.\n\nFor example, if you’re giving instructions to the group, provide it verbally on video as well as visually in the video platform’s chatbox. Sometimes information goes over peoples’ heads, especially with the many outside distractions that come with remote work. Provide instructions in various ways incrementally, rather than all at once, to help ensure all attendees retain them and follow them correctly. \n\nUtilize video platforms’ chat boxes to share instructions and important information with meeting attendees.\n\n**4\\. Provide necessary support**\n---------------------------------\n\nA key component of virtual facilitation is helping attendees understand technicalities specific to the tools you are using. Make sure everyone understands how to use the features of the video conference platform you are meeting on and any other tools they will need.\n\n> Pro tip: send all attendees a list of the tools they will need and how to use them along with a meeting agenda before the meeting so they know what to expect. You can also designate some time at the beginning of the meeting to explain the tools, how they work, and answer any questions. When everyone is on the same page, the meeting will run smoothly. \n\nIf you are using breakout rooms in your meeting, it is helpful to have a facilitator in each breakout room to answer any questions that may arise. If this isn’t possible, make sure to give team members instructions on how to use the help button in the breakout room. Just like a flight attendant call light in an airplane, the facilitator will be notified they are needed in the room when the button is pushed.\n\n**5\\. Use the “raise hand” feature**\n------------------------------------\n\nHave you been in a virtual meeting and felt like you couldn’t get a word in? It can be tough to know when to contribute and how to do so respectfully in a virtual space. The “raise hand” feature in Zoom is a great tool to surpass this roadblock. Ask people to use the button when they want to be called on. It is a clear indicator of desired speaking space and it prevents multiple people from talking at once. You don’t want anyone to feel overlooked or that their opinion doesn’t matter. **The “raise hand” feature is a simple yet powerful way to ensure voices do not go unheard.**\n\nZoom “raise hand” feature.\n\n* * *\n\nMeetings matter, make each one count.

      "content": "I want to add the statistics into the workshop we had before, here's more information: I’m glad you are interested in wellbeing for impact in the context of social enterprises and people working on the ecosystem in the Middle East, specifically Lebanon. This is a very relevant and important topic, especially given the multiple crises that Lebanon is facing, such as the economic collapse, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Beirut port explosion, and the political deadlock.\n\nUnfortunately, there is not much recent research on this specific topic, as most of the studies on social entrepreneurship in Lebanon focus on the general characteristics, challenges, and opportunities of the sector1. However, I was able to find some information that might be useful for you.\n\nOne study that examined health worries, life satisfaction, and social well-being concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon found that the outbreak had a negative impact on mental health outcomes among the Lebanese population2. The study surveyed 988 Lebanese adults online and measured their levels of health worries, life satisfaction, and social well-being concerns using different scales. The study also assessed their COVID-19 good practices, such as wearing masks, washing hands, and avoiding crowds.\n\nThe study found that:\n\n*   Health worries were high among the respondents, with 71.7% reporting being very worried or extremely worried about their health during the pandemic.\n    \n*   Life satisfaction was low among the respondents, with 43.2% reporting being dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their lives during the pandemic.\n    \n*   Social well-being concerns were moderate among the respondents, with 50.8% reporting being somewhat concerned or very concerned about their social well-being during the pandemic.\n    \n*   COVID-19 good practices were high among the respondents, with 86.6% reporting having good or very good practices to prevent infection.\n    \n\nThe study also found that different sociodemographic factors were associated with different mental health outcomes. For example:\n\n*   Higher education levels were associated with lower health worries.\n    \n*   Having children was associated with higher health worries and higher COVID-19 good practices.\n    \n*   Men were more worried about their health and less satisfied with their lives than women.\n    \n*   Young adults and individuals who live alone were more concerned about their social well-being than older adults and those who live with others.\n    \n\nThe study concluded that the COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on mental health outcomes in Lebanon and that there is a need for a national strategy and increased collaboration with public health professionals to mitigate the pandemic’s adverse effects on mental health in the long-term.\n\nAnother source of information that might be relevant for you is the World Bank’s overview of Lebanon’s development situation3. The World Bank provides data, analysis, and recommendations on various aspects of Lebanon’s economic, social, and environmental challenges and opportunities. Some of the key points from the World Bank’s overview are:\n\n*   Lebanon is facing one of the worst economic crises in its history, with a severe contraction of GDP, hyperinflation, currency depreciation, banking sector distress, fiscal deterioration, and debt unsustainability.\n    \n*   The social impact of the crisis is already dire and could become catastrophic; more than half of the country’s population is likely already below the poverty line. Unemployment increased from 11.4% in 2018-19 to 29.6% in 2022.\n    \n*   Lebanon has witnessed a dramatic collapse in basic services, driven by depleting foreign exchange reserves since the onset of the crisis. This has resulted in shortages of fuel, electricity, water, medicine, and other essential goods and services.\n    \n*   The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the humanitarian situation and overwhelmed the health system. Lebanon has recorded more than 1.3 million cases and more than 16,000 deaths as of December 2022. The vaccination campaign has been slow and uneven due to supply constraints and low demand.\n    \n*   The Beirut port explosion on August 4th 2020 caused massive human losses and physical damages. More than 200 people were killed, over 6,000 injured, and 300,000 displaced. The blast also destroyed critical infrastructure and disrupted trade flows.\n    \n*   The political deadlock has prevented the formation of a new government since October 2020. This has hampered the implementation of urgent reforms and delayed negotiations with international creditors and donors.\n    \n\nThe World Bank recommends that Lebanon urgently needs a comprehensive reform program to restore macroeconomic stability, rebuild trust in institutions, address social needs, and unlock external support. The World Bank also provides various forms of assistance to Lebanon to support its recovery and resilience.\n\nI hope this information is helpful for your workshop.

      "content": "Here are some statistics on practices that can help improve wellbeing for social entrepreneurs, NGO workers, and others in the social impact space:\n\n- In a survey of over 500 people working in nonprofits, 63% said practicing self-care makes them better at their jobs. The top self-care activities reported were exercising, meditating, and taking mental health days off work. (Stanford Social Innovation Review, 2018)\n\n- Nonprofit workers who take regular vacations are 30% less likely to report high levels of burnout than those who do not take vacations.

Here is a summary with a specific focus on wellbeing, stress, and related topics and impact:\n\nThe report is an impact assessment of social enterprises in Lebanon, conducted by the Lebanese Social Enterprises Association (LSE) in collaboration with Oxfam. The report surveyed 59 social enterprises in Lebanon and covered the years 2019-2020. The report aimed to monitor the social impact of the social entrepreneurship sector and to demonstrate the added value of social enterprises in Lebanon.\n\nThe report found that:\n\n*   Social enterprises in Lebanon are diverse in terms of their legal forms, sectors, activities, and beneficiaries. They address various social and environmental challenges in Lebanon, such as poverty, inequality, refugee integration, waste management, and renewable energy.\n    \n*   Social enterprises in Lebanon have a positive impact on their beneficiaries, employees, and communities. They provide essential services and products, create jobs and income, empower marginalized groups, improve living conditions, raise awareness, and advocate for change.\n    \n*   Social enterprises in Lebanon also have a positive impact on themselves as organizations. They improve their financial sustainability, increase their innovation and adaptation capacities, enhance their reputation and visibility, and expand their networks and partnerships.\n    \n*   However, social enterprises in Lebanon also face many challenges and threats that affect their wellbeing and performance. These include the economic crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Beirut port explosion, the political instability, the lack of legal recognition and support, the lack of access to finance and markets, the lack of human resources and skills, and the lack of impact measurement tools.\n    \n*   The report recommends that policymakers should adopt a legal framework that recognizes and supports social enterprises; that donors should provide more tailored and flexible funding and capacity building for social enterprises; and that social enterprises should collaborate and network with each other and with other ecosystem actors to share knowledge and resources.\n    \n\nThe report concludes that social enterprises in Lebanon are a valuable asset for the country’s development and resilience. They have proven their ability to cope with crises and to create positive social change. However, they need more recognition, support, and collaboration to overcome the challenges they face and to increase their impact.",
