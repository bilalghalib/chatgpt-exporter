The momentum is going to fall off quickly unless people know exactly how to proceed, at the very least for the daily check-in\t9\tMore concrete next steps for daily check-in and WIGs\tMunir at Town Hall\t\t\n7/3/2023 13:44:43\t\t8\tI appreciate the continuous development of strategies to engage the team \t\t7\tJust keeping the good vibes and pushing forward towards our goals\tTownHall\t\t\n7/3/2023 13:46:30\t\t7\tI liked the birthday memory sharing part. Music is nice. \t\"More participation from the audience, not sure how to \"\"drum that up\"\" better. Good birthday memory thing, although needed more participation. Details about the project after sharing (a bit more). Letting Omar talk about his frist week after celebrating him welcome.\nMayyyybe letting more space for silence, saying we have 5 mins for QA/Feedback. If there is no feedback/qa we will sit in silence. Something like that?\"\t7\tBreakouts? I think they make people come more alive in our programs we need breakouts here? Not sure to do what...\tMunir sharing time\tWork on secret scrum projects, focus on projects, not doing many different things. Doing few things together... \t\n7/3/2023 13:46:34\t\t7\tThe announcement part. It's great for the team to get updates about new projects\tLess time for the intro or maybe do something at the beginning of the meeting and have something for the end of the meeting.\t8\t\tMunir's intro at the Town Hall\t\t\n7/3/2023 13:46:50\t\t8\tThe vibes and the organized thoughts!\t\t7\t\tMunir's Intro @ Town Hall\tMaybe we can think of assigning different co-hosts every other time? \t\n7/3/2023 13:47:24\t\t8\tThe enthusiasm and involving us more.\tI have nothing on mind rn\t8\tNothing on Top of Mind for now, but i feel very much involved, i will let you know in case i think of something, but it really does look good for now\tMountain Top\t\t\n7/3/2023 13:47:27\t\t7\tI can see how much effort Munir put into this introduction, I really appreciate it, having more time together will help us feel more connected and that would push us to contribute more to the Bloom  mission and mindset \t\t6\t\tMunir in Townhall meeting\t\t\n7/5/2023 10:10:55\t\t10\tI like the bit of inspiration and that the facilitator starts to set the tone.

The quick check-ins and celebrations part was helpful. \tMaybe have people describe their emojis? Either in text or by voice? Also I'm wondering how we can respond better when people say they're down or struggling with something ... to acknowledge that, and see how we can support? \t10\tNo ideas come to mind ... but happy to help if I can! :-) Mostly I feel like I can be most helpful by empowering / supporting the team more in this stuff. \tDaily Check-in\t\"I'd love to help the team be more active as leading these team engagement efforts! You all are so lovely, I feel like we will be most supported by helping the team be more active in co-leading this stuff. We're already partially doing that :-) ... and happy to see how we can do more and be more supportive in that. :-) \n\nThanks all! \n\nDMN\"\t\n7/13/2023 10:19:29\t\t7\tNice and speedy facilitation. Nice to share the screen. Great question about motivation\tmore people?\t9\tI can give feedback on people's tasks while they're presenting. Share my thoughts...\tDaily Check-in\t\t\n7/13/2023 10:23:51\t\t8\tNice question… about sources motivation. \tI’d be curious if those checkins should somehow be actionable. Asking people things to apply? What’s something they can do today? Or help each other with those things? Some way we can help you? I’m not sure, and maybe those are different questions for different days as well. :-) Things to experiment with! :-)\t8\tI was engaged, but on a bus. Not the best, it’s much better to be in a more stable spot, but glad I was able to join. \tDaily Check-in\t\t\n7/17/2023 14:52:46\t\t9\thelpful to have different people in the room go over their objectives. One person \"leading\" sharing screen and going over things. I liked Omar's idea to get 4/5 initiatives linked to other people's 1/2's\trotating across the rooms, maybe doing two breakouts, one with people in their teams. And then maybe a random one.\t9\tmusic interludes?\tMonday special checkin\t\t\n7/17/2023 14:58:47\t\t8\tthe breakout rooms and perspectives from each other\tMore breakouts and team engagement activities were we have the chance to better interact and collaborate\t8\t\tQuarterly WIGs Discussion\t\t\n7/17/2023 15:08:04\t\t8\tIt was so engaging and it brought team members closer. It also gave us the chance to understand more what other team members are doing.\tTo be longer in time, and maybe if we can assign for each one a partner before the meeting so they can review the WIGs and how they're written?\t9\t\tDaily Check-in\t\t\n8/10/2023 10:27:40\tBilal\t10\t\t\t10\t\tDaily Check-in\t\t\n8/15/2023 10:27:13\tMohamad Salem\t10\tI love productivity tips\t\t10\t\tDaily Check-in\t\t\n8/15/2023 10:30:57\tMohamad Salem\t7\tGreat discussions\tMore people, less moving into a coworking session. What if it was digested into a blog?\t10\tTake initiative to make a blog from it?\tDaily Check-in\t\t\n8/15/2023 10:31:38\tMohamad Salem\t9\tI enjoyed it! The question about productivity hack was good ... good reminders and things for us to share and keep improving. \tMaybe more energy? And helping keep things tighter on time? There were only 4 people so it was ok to go slow, but if there were more people it would have likely gone over time. Also, how about a good place to keep notes of that stuff? What could be helpful? In the spreadsheet? Or back in a g-doc, maybe a fresh new one? \t9\tMostly good ... though I did have one moment of distraction as I was reading something from a link that was shared in a call, and missed some words that were shared in the conversation. \tDaily Check-in\tI'm curious how to get more people engaged in these calls more regularly. Thoughts? \t\n8/16/2023 10:20:51\tBilal\t10\tLove the quote and the reflections\t\t9\t\tDaily Check-in\t\t\n8/18/2023 13:27:28\tJad\t7\tGreat side chats in the chat, ideas sharing \t\"making sure that the ideas there don't get lost. For example: I’d love a collection of things that we’ve experienced online that have been transformational\nDavid Munir Nabti:\nGreat idea Bilal … let’s collect those, and think of how we can foster those.\"\t9\t\tDaily Check-in\t\t\n8/18/2023 13:31:32\tJad\t10\t\t\t10\tJust keep cams on for everyone and let's explore the effectiveness of having mics on as well throughout \tDaily Check-in\t\t\n8/22/2023 10:33:31\tOmar Essafty\t10\tThe game was fun and creative\t\t10\t\tDaily Check-in\t\t\n8/22/2023 17:09:54\tOmar Essafty\t7\tGame was fun!\tMore participation from the team \t8\tCamera on earlier\tDaily Check-in\t\t\n8/23/2023 10:27:43\tClaude\t9\tGreat sketching brainstorm on Bloom values! Nice ideas there. :-) \tIt was lovely ... but it took longer than expected with only 5 people. Curious how that same activity could have been quicker? \t10\tBy being a better artist? :-) \tDaily Check-in\tAll good! :-) Though still would love to have more people engaged in these calls. \t",

(camera on, proper location, engaged...)**: This seems to be another numerical rating, possibly indicating the engagement level of the respondent during the meeting.\n6. **How could you help this meeting be more effective?**: Textual feedback on how the respondent could contribute to making the meeting more effective.\n7. **What type of meeting was this?**: Describes the type or nature of the meeting.\n8. **Do you have other feedback or suggestions to help our team be more connected, effective and fun?**: Additional feedback or suggestions from the respondent.\n\nNow, let's derive some insights:\n\n1. **Average Effectiveness**: We can calculate the average rating for the \"How effective is / was this meeting?\" column to get an overall idea of the perceived effectiveness of the meetings.\n2. **Engagement Level**: Similarly, we can calculate the average rating for the \"How engaged / participatory were you in this call?\" column to understand participants' overall engagement level.\n3. **Most Common Meeting Type**: It would be useful to see which types of meetings are most common in this dataset.\n4. **Facilitators**: We can identify who facilitated the most meetings.\n5. **Common Themes**: By analyzing the feedback columns, we can identify common positive points and areas of improvement mentioned by participants.\n\nLet's start with the first three insights.",
