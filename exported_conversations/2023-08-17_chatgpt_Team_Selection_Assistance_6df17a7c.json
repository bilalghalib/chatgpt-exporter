      "content": "Given the criteria and stage description you've provided, let's evaluate the information for the enterprise \"Activ Living\" to determine if it fits the requirements:\n\n1. **Enterprise Stage**:\n   - \"Revenues are growing quickly, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable.\"\n   \n   This matches one of the stages you mentioned: \"Revenues are growing quickly, but the enterprise is not yet profitable/sustainable.\"\n\n2. **Green Challenge & Environmental Issue**:\n   - Their product line, primarily natural peanut butter and other health foods, seems to focus on promoting health and well-being. They aim to provide natural products without harmful chemicals.\n   - The SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) they align with is \"SDG GOAL 3: Good Health and Well-being\". While this goal primarily addresses health and well-being, it does not explicitly address environmental or green challenges.\n\n3. **Tracking of Green Impact KPIs**:\n   - This detail is not mentioned explicitly in the provided information.\n\n4. **Reinvesting Revenues**:\n   - Again, this specific detail isn't mentioned in the data provided.\n\n5. **Potential to Sustain Without Program’s Long-Term Support**:\n   - They are already partnering with several other entities (Seda, The Innovation Hub, etc.) which indicates a proactive approach to growth and sustainability. However, definitive potential without long-term support is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n6. **Team Members**:\n   - They mention \"We are a team of four\" which meets the requirement of more than one person in the team. They do not specify how many members work full-time, but they do mention roles such as Director, market and sales person, and product manager, implying there are at least two full-time roles.\n\n7. **Diversity and Inclusivity**:\n   - It's a female-led enterprise, and the founder expresses a desire to work with women, indicating some level of gender diversity.\n\n8. **Restrictions**:\n   - The enterprise is led by more than one individual.\n   - They mentioned being a part of the \"AWE U.S Embassy program\" and have applied to \"HerMeNow Accelerator 2023\". This could be a potential conflict unless they can demonstrate the ability to be part of both programs without any clashes.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\"Activ Living\" does meet several of the criteria you've listed, particularly in enterprise stage, team composition, and being female-led. However, there are some gaps in meeting the green challenge criteria. Also, there's a potential conflict with participation in multiple accelerator programs.\n\nIf this enterprise's alignment with the green challenge can be further clarified (especially in terms of its environmental impact) and if they can prove they have the capacity to join this program in addition to their other commitments, then it might be a good fit. Otherwise, it might not fully align with the provided criteria.",

This can be considered as solving a green challenge to some extent.\n2. **Alignment with SDGs**: The enterprise aligns with SDG GOAL 3: Good Health and Well-being. However, the direct environmental alignment isn't explicitly mentioned.\n3. **Green Impact KPIs**: Not mentioned directly, but the enterprise emphasizes natural and health-conscious products.\n4. **Reinvesting in Green Initiatives**: Not explicitly mentioned.\n5. **Sustainability without Program's Support**: The enterprise has partnerships and initiatives with other entities and seems to be progressing, indicating potential sustainability.\n6. **Team Size**: The enterprise has a team of four, meeting the criteria.\n7. **Restrictions on Sociographics and Other Parameters**: The enterprise is led by a female and is based in South Africa, encouraging diversity.\n8. **Engagement with Other Programs**: The enterprise is part of other initiatives and programs like the HerMeNow Accelerator 2023, but it's not clear if there's a distinction between program offerings.\n\n**Green Business Criteria (at least 2 out of 3)**\n1. **Environmental/Social Impact**: The enterprise emphasizes health-conscious and natural products, but the primary environmental impact isn't explicitly mentioned.\n2. **Environmentally Friendly Services & Products**: Yes.

However, there are a few areas, such as Green Impact KPIs, reinvesting in green initiatives, and their participation in other programs, where more clarity is needed.\n\nIf \"Activ Living\" is the only enterprise you're considering, they're a potential candidate based on the information provided.

We are working towards achieving this by using hotels and museums as mini-outlets and we are already pilot testing the concept in a luxury hotel called Tamarind Village.\n\nAfter getting into our targeted hotels and museums, we will start using an outsourced tanning and processing facility as we source directly from livestock holders ensuring fair wage and significantly decreasing our production cost thus generating more revenue after doing skill transfer.\n\nThe next step would be going online as we project that we would be able to sustainably produce and sell online to meet our customer needs. This would include e-commerce and social media presence for direct sales.\n\nInternational Expansion would come as we leverage online sales and distribution partnerships. Tailor marketing efforts to resonate with the values and preferences of each target market.\n\nFor diversification, we will introduce complementary products, such as leather care items, accessories, or lifestyle goods reflecting the brand's commitment to quality and sustainability.\n\nOur next step will be collaborations and partnerships with influencers, eco-conscious organizations and relevant bodies to amplify the brand's message and expand its reach and work towards achieving impact\n \nThrough skill transfer and training to 50 women and youth in our first three years in business as well as collaborative projects should focus on educating consumers about sustainable leather practices.\n\nNaturally, we would then be scaling and diversifying as we explore the possibility of physical storefronts in strategic locations. Provide customers with an immersive experience that highlights the craftsmanship and story behind each product.\n\nSustainability reports and community engagement would enable us to demonstrate continuous improvement and accountability as we work towards achieving our primary UN SDGs of climate action, responsible production and consumption and gender equality.\n\nContinuous research and Innovation from techniques, to customer feedback, partnerships and following this growth plan, Sulha Afrika aims to position itself as a leader in sustainable and ethical leather craftsmanship, capturing a significant share of the market while driving positive change in the industry.\"\t\"I strongly believe that you have to put yourself in the positions to make the changes that you want to see.

Have a functioning (high-fidelity) prototype with early users / early adopters) \t10/6/2022\tFemale\tKenya\t\"As Sulha Afrika, our goal is beyond the numbers and our success encompasses environmental impact, ethical practices, community empowerment, and customer engagement. Through measurable impact indicators, the brand would monitor progress and keep making positive contributions to both the environment and society through surveys, research, interviews and experts.\n\nSo far, we have educated at least 50 individuals on responsible consumer behavior in our efforts to combat climate change. We have also engaged with a production facility run by 10+ women and youth in Kajiado county which is economically marginalised. To add on, we are currently in talks with a leather technology school called Amayana Leather in Kajiado as well exploring the possibilities of our partnership. \n\nStarting with the environment, our key impact indicator would be reduction in carbon footprint per product throughout its product lifecycle and we would measure this by calculating carbon emissions for each product. We would then implement strategies to minimize emissions over time such as use of renewable energy, minimal waste production, optimized transportation and more.\n\nAs for ethical sourcing, our key impact indicator would be percentage increase in sourcing from ethical suppliers. We would be measuring the amount of raw hides and skins sourced from regenerative farms and the growth of partnerships with such suppliers over time.\n\nWhen it comes to circularity and durability, our key impact indicator reduction in product returns due to quality issues and track complaints while improving quality thus extending lifespan and providing fixing and restoration services.\n\nOur key impact indicator for community empowerment would be the number of youth and women trained and employed as artisan. We would be keeping track of artisans engaged by the brand, their skill development and job satisfaction.\n\nOur impact would also be through educational initiatives with our key impact indicator being the number of community workshops and outreach programs. We will be able to keep track of this using the frequency and attendance of workshops focused on sustainable practices, ethical consumption, and environmental awareness.\"\tLess than USD 500 of personal investment was made.\tREGION - Sub-Saharan Africa\t\tREGION - Sub-Saharan Africa\tLegally registered\tSDG GOAL 12: Responsible Consumption and Production\tDesign\tUnder development\t\"Africa owns 1/5 of global livestock population? Relatively, Kenya is the 3rd largest livestock holder in Africa but Kenya’s contribution to the annual global USD 100 Billion genuine leather industry is very insignificant according to Kenya Leather Development Council.\n\nMany African countries do livestock-keeping for food, cultural and religious beliefs leaving raw hides and skins as by-products. These results into a lot of wasted skins and hides and increased uses of faux leather products which are plastic based and quickly end up in landfills due to their short lifespan hence causing environmental pollution thus escalating climate change.\n\nIt is a sad sight watching this rich natural capital of raw hides and skins generating greenhouse gases as they decompose. In addition to this, most of the livestock population is in the Arid and semi-arid regions of Kenya which are economically marginalized and low income. With the Arid and semi arid lands making up about 80% of Kenya and nearly 95% of family earnings depending on the livestock industry in one way or another. With the ongoing drought worsening their conditions, employment has never been more crucial for the livestock holders and the women and youth from these low income backgrounds. The leather value chain creates the most employment opportunities in the livestock industry.\"\t\"Sulha Afrika got inspired by our ancestors who utilized their indigenous knowledge to use renewable and natural resources. We are an ethical, sustainable and environmental conscious brand which practices circularity and meticulously work towards achieving 3 SDGs; responsible production and consumption, climate action and gender equality.\n\nAt Sulha Afrika, we do vegetable-tanning which is 100% plant origin and leaves no toxic residue over chromium-based tanning which affects both human health and the environment since the discharge causes eco-system damage, material loss and loss of agricultural lands by polluting our waterways.\n\nWe offer durable and unique products and offer leather fixing and restoration services. In addition, we have also created a unique buy-back model where we buy back some of our leather products from customers in exchange for discounts on the next purchase this gives value to customers and we  repurpose the old products into new products.\n\nIn conclusion, Sulha Afrika adds value on raw hides and skins destined for landfills and subsequently reduce faux leather products (plastic based and are not durable) in the market thus decreasing waste reaching the landfills. We create awareness and provide an alternative promoting behavior change and help the consumer be more eco-conscious.\"\tDue to our creativity, we currently have three outsourced production facilities one in Nairobi county, one in Kajiado and one in Kilifi county with our biggest challenge being demand than supply, built a strong network of opportunities and a running business in less than a year and are projecting to generate revenue of at-least USD 90,000 in our first 3 years in business despite investing less than USD 500.

This was quite noticeable for us during our exhibitions (local markets and wedding fair) where people got to learn about our concept for the first time and were happy to finally find a green solution they can cherish on a personal level.\nOne of our most notable experiences was our last wedding where all of the guests reached out asking to take the decorations with them to plant in their gardens!

Traditionally, vast quantities of cut flowers are used for weddings, only to be discarded shortly after the event, contributing to landfill waste and environmental harm.\nObserving that a significant portion of the flowers, particularly fresh roses, is imported, it becomes evident that they are neither a sustainable choice nor beneficial for the economy. Additionally, It is important to note that the wedding industry is one of the biggest markets in Lebanon with a great impact overall.\nWe have noticed this problem starting with traditional bouquets, as the founder of Echeveria, I personally used to hate getting fresh flowers bouquets as gifts, watching my parents spend money on something that would last a couple of days and end up as waste in the garbage. This idea was carried to a bigger scale when I started attending weddings, noticing the huge number of flowers being thrown away after a one day event. \"\t\"Our value proposition lies in promoting a greener and more socially conscious approach to celebrations, preserving memories in a way that aligns with environmental responsibility.\nOur solution is the creation of exquisite succulent art pieces and dried flower designs that elegantly replace traditional wedding floral arrangements. By offering a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative, we provide couples with the opportunity to adorn their celebrations with timeless beauty while reducing floral waste.

We believe that support groups will help in tackling the stigma around mental health, hence sensitization on the need for joining support groups through our platform will increase user engagement on our platform. We plan on organizing frequent workplace and school training programs so as to market the services offered through our platform, and in turn increase revenue and user engagement. We envision being the preferred platform providing access to mental health services.  We, therefore, plan on onboarding mental health professionals to our platform and engage students pursuing careers in mental health as early as now, by sensitizing them on the role technology plays in making their services accessible to all.\tI am motivated to join the programs so I can gain access to skill development. As a founder with little experience in running a company, I look forward to receiving support from experts and mentors through this program. I would also like to gain access to investors who can help me establish roots in the market.\tOur team is made up of a founder and co-founder. The founder who is the Chief Executive Officer, handles planning and implementation of programs, resource mobilization, social media management and marketing. The co-founder on the other hand, is the Chief Technical Officer whose role is to provide technical support to the company and users.\tSema Nasi Safe Space is a telehealth company that promotes mental health by providing access to affordable programs and services through an online platform. Our platform conveniently connects Kenyans to mental health professionals virtually enabling them to access therapy services and support groups. \tOur priority area is on corporate social responsibility. In order to tackle the stigma around mental health, our company will have to prioritize on awareness campaigns and establishment of community safe spaces. Kenya is experiencing a rapid increase in suicides, mental health conditions, substance use and addictive disorders of an epidemic proportion, indicating social challenges and unmet needs at a societal level. We envision partnering with County Governments in establishing safe spaces at grass root levels to provide communities and especially the Youth, with mental health support through support groups, outreach programs, and awareness campaigns. With Government initiatives such as the National Optic Fibre Backbone Project and the landing of international submarine cables to expand internet coverage, Kenyans will be able to access online mental health services on our platform at these established safe spaces.\t3.2.

With a population of over 53 million and a psychiatrist-population ratio of 0.19 to 100000, most Kenyans cannot easily access mental healthcare services. Being depressed and suicidal at one point, I needed help, and I did not know where to access it without being stigmatized. My experience made me come up with Sema Nasi Safe Space as a solution to making mental health services accessible. Our company helps in saving time, energy, raw materials like paper, plastic and fuel hence lowering carbon footprint of the health industry.\tOur company provides convenience in accessing programs and services. Our online services improve consumer outcome, efficiencies as well as improve revenue. \tWe have not made any sales yet but have onboarded six therapists so far. Our company charges a virtual workspace fee of 25% on every service offered through our platform. A therapy session costs an average of Kenya Shillings 1500 which means our company will make Kenya Shillings 375 per session. If we have at least one thousand therapy sessions in a month, we will make Kenya Shillings 375,000 of passive income.\tPrivate Sector\tsemanasi.or.ke\tApplied to HMN2023\tHerMeNow Accelerator 2023 - Applicants\tbilal@bloom.pm\t\t\tHerstory makers",

By providing online access to mental healthcare services, the company reduces the need for physical travel, thereby reducing the carbon footprint associated with transportation.\n    - The company's operations save on raw materials like paper, plastic, and fuel, highlighting an environmental benefit. \n\n2. **Impact and Scope of Green Practices:** \n    - The impact of their green practices, while indirect, is significant given the rapid adoption of online health services. Reducing the need for physical consultations not only cuts down on travel-related emissions but also on the resources needed to maintain a physical health facility.\n    - The indirect green impact also extends to societal benefits. By ensuring that more Kenyans have access to mental health services online, Sema Nasi helps in reducing the potential strain on public transport and medical facilities. This reduction in physical traffic, both in terms of transport and human influx to physical facilities, indirectly contributes to the environment.\n    - The establishment of community safe spaces in partnership with County Governments might further reduce the need for long-distance travel to seek mental health services.\n\n3. **Innovative and Unique Solutions to Green Challenges:** \n    - Sema Nasi Safe Space's core innovation lies in its telehealth solution to address the mental health challenges in Kenya. While it may not be directly innovating to address green challenges, its digital-first approach inherently promotes eco-friendly practices.\n    - The platform's emphasis on online therapy sessions and support groups minimizes the need for physical infrastructure, materials, and transport, representing a sustainable model for health service delivery.\n\n**Conclusion:** While Sema Nasi Safe Space's primary focus is on mental health accessibility in Kenya, its online platform inherently embodies several green practices. Their model, which emphasizes virtual consultations and support, indirectly contributes to sustainability by reducing travel and the usage of tangible resources. Based on this, they demonstrate some alignment with the green criteria, but their environmental impact is more implicit than explicit.",

      "content": "Given the green criteria you've provided, I will review \"GebRaa\" against the criteria:\n\n**1. Their core business model addresses an environmental or social issue – their main purpose is to make an environmental impact.**\n\n- GebRaa's mission revolves around the revitalization of Egyptian crafts at risk. This implies preserving cultural heritage and supporting traditional artisans. While this is more of a socio-cultural impact than strictly environmental, it does highlight a social purpose. \n- The company mentions that cultural production is essentially a green production since it employs local talents, uses local materials, operates within local communities, and predominantly relies on manual labor with simple tools which conserves energy.\n\n**2. The services and products they offer are environmentally friendly (reusable or made from recycled materials) and replace demand for non-green products and services.**\n\n- GebRaa produces home and fashion accessories made by artisans. There is no explicit mention of the materials being reusable or recycled, but the production is artisanal, which typically involves sustainable practices.\n- GebRaa emphasizes on product innovation with green materials, but the exact nature of these materials isn't detailed.\n- The products they sell likely replace demand for mass-produced items, which can be more resource-intensive and less sustainable.\n\n**3. They are environmentally conscious in their operations (minimal emissions or renewable energy, raw materials) through the greening of their existing production process.**\n\n- The company highlights the green nature of artisanal production: most of the supply chain is within walking distance, and production primarily uses hands and simple tools, which minimizes energy consumption.\n- GebRaa mentions working in local communities, reducing the need for transportation (and associated emissions). \n- There is no mention of renewable energy or specific raw materials used, but their local-focused supply chain and traditional craft production methods inherently support sustainability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile GebRaa does showcase elements that align with the green criteria, it fits more within the social impact dimension rather than a strictly environmental one. They are environmentally conscious in their operations and emphasize the green nature of their production. However, specific details on the use of recycled materials, renewable energy, and exact green practices in their operation are not thoroughly detailed in the given information.",

These chemicals can end up in landfills and water systems, causing environmental harm.\n    - The founder's rationale behind the business emphasizes the importance of knowing the ingredients in skincare products, which implies a dedication to transparency and potentially the reduction of harmful chemicals in the environment.\n    - The company's mission revolves around providing environmentally conscious skincare alternatives. Their products help in avoiding the introduction of toxic substances to landfills.\n\n2. **Products and Services are Environmentally Friendly:**\n    - **Ciwale** focuses on using natural ingredients, which are presumably more environmentally friendly than synthetic counterparts.\n    - The emphasis on eco-friendly packaging is a strong indicator of their commitment to reducing environmental waste and harm.\n    - Their products replace demand for non-green cosmetics, thereby diminishing the market share of products that might harm the environment.\n\n3. **Environmentally Conscious Operations:**\n    - While there's a clear commitment to eco-friendly packaging, there isn't explicit information regarding other operational aspects, such as energy use, emissions, or sourcing of raw materials. \n    - The founder's dedication to explaining the importance of natural skincare on both skin and nature hints at a broader environmental consciousness, but without specifics about operations, it's challenging to fully assess their alignment with this criterion.\n\n**Conclusion:** **Ciwale**'s primary focus revolves around natural skincare and cosmetics with eco-friendly packaging, addressing a key environmental issue associated with the cosmetics industry. They meet the first two green criteria strongly by offering environmentally friendly products that replace demand for non-green alternatives. However, there's limited explicit information on how environmentally conscious their operations are, making it difficult to confirm their full alignment with the third criterion. Nonetheless, based on available information, **Ciwale** appears to lean significantly towards the green criteria.",

      "content": "Let's evaluate both enterprises, **Sema Nasi Safe Space** and **Ciwale**, against these criteria:\n\n### 1. Location Criteria:\n\n- **Sema Nasi Safe Space**: Located in **Kenya**, which falls under the eligible Sub-Saharan East Africa list.\n- **Ciwale**: Based in **Iraq**, which is one of the eligible MENA countries.\n\n### 2. Green Challenge Criteria:\n\n- **Sema Nasi Safe Space**: \n  - Addresses mental health, which aligns with SDG GOAL 3: Good Health and Well-being. While health and well-being are crucial, they are not necessarily \"green\" in the environmental sense. However, the organization does mention helping in saving raw materials and reducing the carbon footprint.\n  - Tracking KPIs related to their impact.\n  - There's no clear mention of reinvesting at least half of revenues into green initiatives.\n\n- **Ciwale**: \n  - Offers eco-friendly products which address environmental issues associated with cosmetics.\n  - No specific mention of reinvesting half of revenues into green initiatives, though the core model is green-oriented.\n  - There isn't a clear mention of aligning with SDGs or tracking of green impact KPIs other than the general emphasis on eco-friendliness.\n\n### 3. Independence and Sustainability:\n\n- **Sema Nasi Safe Space**: No explicit mention of their ability to sustain without long-term support, but their revenue model implies a plan for self-sustainability.\n- **Ciwale**: It's unclear if they can sustain without long-term program support. However, their current progress and future plans hint at a desire for independence and growth.\n\n### 4. Team Size:\n\n- **Sema Nasi Safe Space**: They have a founder and co-founder. Both seem to be working full-time given their roles.\n- **Ciwale**: The enterprise has more than one person, but it's not explicitly mentioned that both are working full-time.\n\n### 5. Sociographic Encouragement:\n\n- **Sema Nasi Safe Space**: It's a female-led enterprise from Kenya, so it has a diversity factor in gender and geographical location.\n- **Ciwale**: Female-led enterprise based in Iraq, indicating diversity in terms of gender and location.\n\n### 6. Restrictions:\n\n- **Sema Nasi Safe Space**: It's not an enterprise of only one individual, and there's no mention of involvement in other accelerator programs.\n- **Ciwale**: Has more than one individual in the team and no mention of simultaneous involvement in other programs.\n\n**Conclusions**:\n\n- **Sema Nasi Safe Space**: Meets the location, team size, and diversity criteria. While it does address a vital societal challenge, its alignment with the green/environmental focus isn't very strong. There's no explicit mention of reinvesting revenues into green initiatives.\n- **Ciwale**: Aligns well with the green challenge, location, and diversity criteria. Uncertainty remains regarding the full-time engagement of team members and reinvesting revenues.\n\nGiven these evaluations, both enterprises have potential alignment with the program's criteria, but further clarification might be needed in specific areas.",

Our strategic initiatives aim to empower farmers, enhance sustainability, and promote gender equality within the industry.\n\nFirstly, our cutting-edge product, the Smart Fish Feeder, stands as a cornerstone of our commitment to innovation. By automating fish feeding processes, this IoT-enabled device addresses labor challenges and feed wastage, resulting in increased efficiency and reduced environmental impact.\n\nSecondly, our digital platform connects fish feed suppliers directly to farmers, revolutionizing the distribution process. This direct B2C model ensures affordable, high-quality feed, while real-time monitoring enhances inventory management and efficiency.\n\nMoreover, we operate a fish shop in Nairobi, providing fair market prices for farmers' produce. This initiative empowers local communities, stimulates income growth, and fosters a thriving market ecosystem.\n\nIn parallel, our focus on gender equality is evident throughout our endeavors. By reducing the labor-intensive aspects of fish farming, we strive to empower women to engage in the sector without compromising their dignity.\nBy aligning these initiatives, we create a holistic solution that addresses labor inefficiencies, supports local economies, and fosters environmental sustainability. Our comprehensive approach ultimately positions us as a catalyst for positive transformation across the aquaculture industry, enabling farmers to maximize their margins and contribute to a thriving and equitable sector.\"\t3.1.

Second, it reduces the workload of fish farmers by automating the feeding process, which allows them to focus on other important aspects of fish farming, such as monitoring fish growth and health. Third, the solution provides a platform for feed manufacturers to sell their products directly to farmers, which promotes transparency and fair pricing in the supply chain. Finally, the solution has the potential to improve the income and livelihoods of smallholder fish farmers, who are an important contributor to food security in the region. By increasing the efficiency and productivity of their operations, they can increase their income and provide more affordable protein to local communities. Our fish shop has supported over 200 farmers with access to better markets.\tIn the past 3 plus years of operation, we have raised over Ksh.5M in equity.

Fish serves as a vital source of livelihood for over 32 million fisher communities in East Africa. The problem came to my attention when I learned about the devastating \"\"sex-for-fish\"\" practice in the Kenyan lake region, which significantly contributed to high HIV prevalence rates in the area. This revelation underscored the urgent need for solutions that empower women to participate in fish production systems rather than solely engaging in fish trading.\nWitnessing the dire consequences of this practice and understanding the vulnerability of women in the fishing industry inspired us to take action. We recognized that a comprehensive solution was needed to not only address gender disparities but also promote sustainable fish farming practices to alleviate the pressures on wild fish populations. This realization marked the beginning of our journey to develop and champion products like the Smart Fish Feeder, which not only reduces labor costs and wastage but also fosters gender equality and climate resilience within the aquaculture sector. Our commitment is to drive positive change in the industry, ensuring that women can participate with dignity and contribute to both their families and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\t\"Our company, Fish Box Africa, offers a comprehensive solution to address the pressing challenges faced by the aquaculture industry. Our flagship product, the Smart Fish Feeder, revolutionizes fish farming by integrating IoT technology to precisely dispense fish feed. This automation significantly reduces labor costs, feed wastage, and environmental impacts, fostering more efficient and sustainable practices.\n\nFurthermore, we provide a unique platform that connects fish feed suppliers directly with farmers through our application. This direct B2C model eliminates middlemen, ensuring farmers access to high-quality feed at affordable prices while enhancing transparency in the supply chain. Our solution also includes a smart system that monitors feed consumption and maintains inventory, enabling farmers to optimize their operations.\n\nIn addition, Fish Box Africa operates a fish shop that provides fair market prices for farmers' produce in Nairobi. By doing so, we empower local communities and enhance income opportunities for small-scale farmers.\nOur value proposition revolves around gender equality, climate resilience, and sustainable practices. We are dedicated to creating a positive impact within the aquaculture industry by empowering women, supporting farmers, and contributing to the preservation of fish stocks and ecosystems.\"\tCurrently, revenue is generated from the sales of fish in our Nairobi shop. We sold over 74,000 pieces of fish last year making Ksh.2.4M last year and we are expecting to double that number this year.

We also need infrastructure and resources, financial resources to cater for office and hardware appliances,  STEM equipment and materials. As a registered company, we seek to comply with the regulations authority of Kenya in yearly payment of taxes.\nThe team of trainers require resources and financial stability to help move to the different schools across Kenya and this requires funding as this will greatly secure the company to continue running for years. \"\t2.2.

I first identified this while serving as a high school teacher at Kihuru Ini Secondary school,  a rural school and there were very few (2 percent) of girls enrolling in STEAM courses after high school. Due to this worrying trend I decided to sensitise girls to embrace STEM subjects because I realised the more I talked to these girls about the career pathways and the many opportunities open for girls in STEAM and STEM,  the more the girls improved in the STEM subjects in high school.  This was the driving force towards my starting an organization that gives girls a voice in STEAM. \tOur value proposition is to instill creativity,  innovation and a passion for STEM and STEAM from primary school to university through secondary school maintaining engagement and enthusiasm throughout the lives of girls. This will then help in Unleashing an innovation culture and also teach the girls how to tale risks, to be creative and problem solvers.

The main goal is to enhance the representation of women in STEAM fields and reduce digital illiteracy.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Focused Mission**: Targeting to sensitize 1,000,000 girls about the importance of STEAM and STEM is ambitious and crucial for a 21st-century workforce.\n2. **Experienced Team**: The team consists of experts from various STEAM backgrounds, ensuring diverse and comprehensive training.\n3. **Results-Oriented**: An increase in girls enrolling in STEM careers in Kiambu County from 67 in 2021 to 267 in 2022 showcases the tangible impact of their efforts.\n4. **Holistic Approach**: By combining STEAM, STEM, and Digital literacy skills, they are providing an all-encompassing education.\n\n**Areas of Concern:**\n\n1. **Financial Challenges**: The primary source of funding is from personal savings, and their revenue model (Ksh 3000 per school visit) might not sustain long-term growth and expansion.\n2. **Resource Limitation**: The company is in dire need of infrastructural resources, including desktop computers and STEM equipment.\n\n**Opportunities for Growth:**\n\n1. **Digital Expansion**: The current number of monthly active users (300) for virtual training indicates a potential to expand and reach more girls online.\n2. **Diversify Funding Streams**: Explore partnerships, grants, or sponsorships that align with their mission.\n3. **Extend Outreach**: While their current focus seems to be on Kiambu County, expanding to other counties can enhance their impact.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nThe Women in STEAM initiative is a commendable endeavor, especially considering the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields. While they have showcased substantial results, there's a need for sustainable funding, strategic partnerships, and expansion of resources to enhance their reach and impact.\n\nFor an accelerator program, they would benefit immensely from mentorship in sustainable business models, strategic partnerships, and digital marketing. Given their mission and results, they could attract significant interest from potential partners and sponsors.\n\n**Green Characteristics Coverage:**\n\n1. **Core Business Model**: Yes, they address a social issue aiming to increase the representation of women in STEAM fields.\n2. **Environmentally Friendly Services/Products**: Not explicitly mentioned. While their services are geared towards education, it's not clear if they use or promote environmentally friendly materials.\n3. **Environmentally Conscious Operations**: Again, not explicitly mentioned. While their main focus is education, there’s no mention of their operations being environmentally conscious in terms of emissions, energy, or raw materials.\n\n**Total Green Characteristics Covered**: 1 out of 3.",
