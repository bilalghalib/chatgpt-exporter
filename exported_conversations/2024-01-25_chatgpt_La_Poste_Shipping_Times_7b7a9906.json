Others are made rigid, like containers or lids, through different manufacturing processes or by adding reinforcing materials. So, it's a combination of thickness, type of polypropylene, manufacturing process, and additives that determines how flexible or rigid a polypropylene item is.",

The reason is that the bottom of the pressure cooker can be hotter than the steam, potentially causing the bag to melt or stick. To prevent this, you can place a rack or a trivet at the bottom of the cooker. This creates a barrier, ensuring the bags are exposed only to the steam and not the direct heat from the cooker's base. This way, you'll protect the bags while still effectively sterilizing them.",

      "content": "For sterilizing items in a pressure cooker, whether it's mushroom grow bags or jars of liquid culture, the general principle is similar. You don't want the items to directly touch the bottom of the cooker because of the risk of overheating and damage. However, the approach can vary slightly:\n\n1. **For Jars of Liquid Culture**: You usually fill the pressure cooker with enough water so it's just below the level of the jars. The jars should be placed on a rack or trivet, not directly on the bottom. The idea is to use steam for sterilization, not direct boiling water.\n\n2. **For Mushroom Grow Bags**: Similarly, place them on a rack or trivet. The bags should not sit directly on the bottom. The water level should be lower than the bags. The steam generated in the cooker will do the sterilization.\n\nSo, in both cases, the rack or trivet serves to protect the items from direct heat, while the steam generated provides the sterilization. Make sure to follow specific instructions for your pressure cooker and the items you're sterilizing for the best results.",
