Shows Bilal using his own values clarification tool (built day before) for personal reflection. Very different tone from technical conversations - poetic, vulnerable, contemplative. Reveals family context: married with baby boy, studies with a sheikh. The value 'Love in Still Connection' elegantly integrates fatherhood, marriage, and spiritual practice through theme of presence over action."
