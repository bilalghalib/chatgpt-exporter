ITC’s mandate covers all developing countries and transition economies with special emphasis on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDs) Fragile States and Sub-Saharan Africa. To support a more inclusive distribution of development gains, ITC works with women, youth, and marginalized groups in developing countries to empower them through entrepreneurship and skills that provide gateways to jobs and enterprise creation. \n\n \n\nThe Building Equitable and Inclusive Transformation (BEIT) project in Iraq, implemented by UN-Habitat, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Trade Centre (ITC), aims to foster decent work and affordable housing. This multi-faceted initiative encompasses integrating employment-intensive investment and local resource-based approaches into Iraq's National Public Works Programme, enhancing capacity for sustainable and affordable housing, promoting trade-led private sector engagement in climatesmart construction, and empowering social partners for better labour market outcomes. Through these components, BEIT focuses on gender and sustainable financing, developing sustainable financial tools and legislative frameworks, forming SME cluster alliances, and fostering social dialogue and capacity building among social partners, all to address housing challenges, create jobs, and support SMEs while mitigating climate change impacts in the housing sector. \n\n \n\nMain objectives: \n\nThis mission corresponds to the following Outputs and Activities under Bilal’s Terms of Reference. \n\nOutput 1.

Through these sessions we can identify stakeholder engagement, competency, and skills opening doors for future focus groups and expert consultations.  \n\nMission agenda: \n\nThe development of the agenda below is in progress and some last-minute changes might occur.
