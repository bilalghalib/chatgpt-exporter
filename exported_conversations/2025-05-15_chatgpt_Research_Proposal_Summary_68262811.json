The study will investigate how humans directly perceive qualities and meaning through their attentional practices, how these perceptions can be formalized without reduction to quantitative measures, and how they transform developmentally through generative tensions. Using a multi-method approach combining phenomenological inquiry, intersubjective validation, and formal modeling, we aim to establish an empirically grounded framework for understanding quality perception as a real phenomenon with ontological significance. The project seeks to bridge Western philosophical traditions with indigenous relational epistemologies to create a more comprehensive understanding of how humans perceive meaning and quality in their lived experience.\n\n## 1. Background and Significance\n\n### 1.1 The Crisis of Meaning in Contemporary Society\nContemporary society faces a crisis of meaning characterized by fragmentation, polarization, and a diminished capacity for shared understanding. This crisis stems partly from dominant epistemological frameworks that prioritize quantitative measurement over qualitative understanding, and that struggle to account for the lived experience of meaning and value. The Cartesian split between subject and object has created a worldview where qualities are viewed as merely subjective projections rather than real aspects of our relationship with the world.\n\n### 1.2 Theoretical Foundations\nSeveral theoretical traditions have attempted to address this crisis:\n\n**Phenomenology** (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) has explored the structures of direct experience, highlighting the primacy of perception over cognition.\n\n**Enactivism** (Varela, Thompson, Di Paolo) has demonstrated how cognition emerges through the dynamic coupling between organisms and their environments.\n\n**Value Philosophy** (Taylor, Chang, Edelman) has investigated how values function in human choice-making, introducing concepts like \"constitutive attentional policies\" to describe what we attend to when making meaningful choices.\n\n**Indigenous Knowledge Systems** maintain relational epistemologies where knowing occurs through participation rather than detached observation, offering alternatives to Cartesian dualism.\n\n### 1.3 Research Gap\nDespite these advances, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of how to formalize meaning perception without reducing it to something less than it is. Current approaches either:\n1. Reduce qualities to quantitative measures\n2. Leave qualities as purely subjective phenomena without intersubjective validity\n3. Fail to account for how quality perception develops and transforms\n\nThis research aims to address these gaps by developing an integrative framework that respects the phenomenological reality of quality perception while establishing its intersubjective validity.\n\n## 2. Research Objectives\n\n### 2.1 Primary Research Question\nHow can we develop a formal model of relational meaning perception that accounts for both first-person phenomenological experience and third-person observation, enables tracking of developmental transformations, and provides a foundation for technologies and practices that enhance rather than diminish human capacity for quality perception?\n\n### 2.2 Specific Objectives\n1. **Phenomenological Characterization**: Develop a refined phenomenological account of how qualities are directly perceived through attention\n2. **Formal Modeling**: Create multiple formal models of meaning perception beyond Edelman's Constitutive Attentional Policies\n3. **Intersubjective Validation**: Establish methodologies for validating quality perception across observers\n4. **Developmental Mapping**: Identify patterns in how quality perception transforms through generative tensions\n5. **Practical Applications**: Design interventions and technologies that enhance capacity for quality perception\n6. **Cross-Cultural Integration**: Bridge Western and indigenous approaches to meaning and relationship\n\n## 3. Theoretical Framework\n\n### 3.1 Quality Perception as Relational\nThis research adopts a relational ontology where qualities are neither purely subjective nor purely objective, but emerge in the relationship between perceiver and perceived. Quality perception is not constructed but discovered within this relationship.\n\n### 3.2 Field Theory of Attention\nWe propose a field theory of attention where:\n- Attention functions as a field with attractors and repulsors\n- \"Draw\" and \"repulse\" forces are real features of this attentional field\n- These forces reveal something about both the perceiver and the perceived\n\n### 3.3 Developmental Model\nWe hypothesize that quality perception develops through:\n- Encounter with generative tensions between competing qualities\n- Resolution through the discovery of more comprehensive qualities\n- Integration of previously competing qualities into more complex attentional patterns\n\n### 3.4 Multiple Formalizations\nWe will develop five formal models of meaning perception:\n\n1. **Topological Model**: Representing meaning as landscapes with basins of attraction\n2. **Vector Field Model**: Mapping draw/repulse forces as vectors in attentional space\n3. **Dynamic Systems Model**: Formalizing how attentional patterns stabilize and transform\n4. **Participatory Sense-Making Model**: Capturing how meaning emerges in interaction\n5. **Metastable Dynamics Model**: Representing meaning as emerging from the balance between integration and differentiation\n\n## 4.

      "content": "# Formalizing Relational Meaning Perception: An Integrative Analysis\n\n## Introduction  \nUnderstanding how humans perceive **meaning and quality** in relationships and experiences is a profound challenge cutting across disciplines. The research question asks how we might develop a **formal model of “relational meaning perception”** – one that **bridges first-person phenomenological experience with third-person observation**, tracks **developmental transformations** in meaning-making, and lays a foundation for **technologies or practices to enhance quality perception**. This analysis will critically examine the theoretical foundations of the proposal – ranging from classical **phenomenology** to **indigenous relational epistemologies** – and evaluate the proposed multi-method approach and formal models. We will also explore alternative frameworks (like **ecological psychology** and **systems theory**), highlight the tension between subjective experience and intersubjective validation, and consider how this work could resonate across diverse worldviews (Western academic, indigenous, spiritual, and systems-thinking communities). Finally, we identify potential collaborators across domains and suggest funding sources, before offering a synthesis of promising integrative pathways to answer the core question.\n\n## Theoretical Underpinnings of Relational Meaning Perception  \nDeveloping a model of relational meaning perception requires a firm grounding in several theoretical traditions. The proposal draws on a rich palette of ideas – **phenomenology, enactivism, field theory of attention, value philosophy,** and **indigenous relational epistemologies** – each of which offers unique insights into how meaning and quality are experienced.\n\n- **Phenomenology:** As a philosophy and method, phenomenology is the study of conscious experience from the first-person perspective【34†L41-L48】. It investigates the *structures of experience* and how things appear to us in our awareness【34†L43-L48】. A key concept is **intentionality** – the idea that consciousness is always *about* or directed toward something, and that objects of experience carry “meaning” or significance as they appear to the subject【34†L43-L48】. In the context of quality perception, phenomenology provides tools to rigorously describe what the *experience* of meaning feels like (the subtle feeling of significance in a conversation, the sense of harmony in a landscape, etc.). A strength of classical phenomenology (from Husserl to Merleau-Ponty) is its insistence on **bracketing assumptions** and describing experience in its own terms, which guards against reducing subjective meaning to mere physical data. However, a limitation is that pure phenomenological descriptions can be **highly subjective and difficult to verify** externally. Phenomenology alone does not easily produce formal models – it yields rich qualitative insights but not quantitative frameworks. Thus, while phenomenology is crucial for **honoring first-person experience**, it must be complemented by other approaches to satisfy the “third-person” or formal modeling aims.\n\n- **Enactivism:** Enactive cognitive science builds a bridge between subjective experience and embodied interaction. **Enactivism argues that cognition (and meaning) arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment**【39†L1-L4】. In this view, organisms “enact” or bring forth a world of meaning through their sensorimotor activity【39†L1-L4】, rather than passively receiving information. Enactivism is rooted in the work of Varela, Thompson, and Rosch (1991) and others who drew on phenomenology and biology (e.g. the concept of **autopoiesis**) to propose that **sense-making** is an active, relational process – the organism’s adaptive engagement with the world is what *creates* meaning. The **participatory nature** of meaning is further emphasized by enactive accounts of social cognition (we will discuss “participatory sense-making” in detail later). The enactivist stance strengthens the theoretical underpinning by providing a **non-dualistic framework**: meaning is neither solely “in the head” nor solely “in the world,” but emerges in the **relationship** between them【32†L31-L39】【32†L49-L57】. A potential limitation is that enactivism, while conceptually rich, can be challenging to formalize – it often relies on metaphors of dynamical systems and network interactions without a single agreed mathematical formulation. Nonetheless, enactivism’s emphasis on embodiment and interaction offers a valuable antidote to abstract, disembodied views of meaning. It aligns well with the notion of *relational* meaning perception, suggesting that **quality is perceived through doing and being with, not just through detached observation**.\n\n- **Field Theory of Attention:** The proposal references a “field theory of attention,” pointing to the idea that attention and awareness operate not just as a narrow spotlight but as a **field-like phenomenon**. This resonates with the **Gestalt psychology** and early field theorists. For instance, Kurt Lewin’s psychological **field theory** examined how an individual’s behavior and perceptions are shaped by the total **“life space”** of person plus environment【42†L142-L150】. Lewin even used **topological maps and vector diagrams** to represent a person’s goals, tensions, and the valences (attractive or repulsive forces) of environmental objects【42†L142-L150】. In Lewin’s formula *B = f(P, E)*, behavior is a function of the person and environment together【42†L147-L154】 – a clear acknowledgement that meaning and action arise in a relational field. Applied to attention, a field theory would suggest that what we notice (figure) and what we ignore (ground) are part of a **unified field of awareness**. Our **attention “field” can expand or contract**, and multiple elements can be present in the fringe of awareness at once. This view finds some support in William James’ notion of the “fringe” of consciousness (the felt background of meaning around the focal object)【30†L31-L39】. It also aligns with contemplative descriptions of open awareness (attention as an all-encompassing field). The strength here is an emphasis on **holistic perception**: meaning is not isolated in discrete bits, but arises from patterns and **wholeness** in the attentional field. A challenge, however, is that “field of attention” is somewhat metaphorical – translating it into a formal model might require borrowing constructs from physics (fields, forces) or mathematics (topologies) and ensuring they map onto psychological reality. There is precedent: Lewin’s work was literally a *topological and vector-field psychology*【42†L142-L150】, an intriguing early attempt to formalize psychological meanings as geometric relationships. The current proposal’s consideration of a topological model and vector-field model (discussed later) indeed echoes these ideas. In summary, a field theory of attention contributes the idea that **meaning is distributed in a contextual field** – for example, the *quality* of an experience depends on the whole context (environment, background feelings, etc.) that our attention is embracing, not just a single focal object.\n\n- **Value Philosophy (Quality and Axiology):** The term “quality perception” hints at philosophical discussions of *value* and *quality*. One notable influence here could be Robert **Pirsig’s Metaphysics of Quality**, which attempted to place “Quality” (with a capital Q) as a fundamental reality beyond subject and object. Pirsig distinguished between **Dynamic Quality** – the immediate, unanalysable sense of value in the moment – and **static quality** – the fixed concepts and judgments we derive afterwards【26†L167-L175】【26†L169-L177】. *Dynamic Quality is “the continually changing flux of immediately-experienced reality,” which cannot be fully defined and “can only be given directly in experience”*【26†L167-L175】. This notion underscores that the *essence* of quality or meaning is something directly **felt before it is thought**. In more academic terms, **axiology** (the philosophy of values) provides insight into how humans perceive something as good, meaningful, or valuable. Phenomenologists like Max Scheler argued that we have an intuitive *value perception* – for example, we *feel* the worth of a kind act or the beauty of a painting through a kind of emotional intuition, prior to intellectual analysis. The **strength** of including value philosophy is that it explicitly targets the **qualitative, normative aspect** of meaning – not just how meaning is formed, but how we recognize *better vs worse*, *more meaningful vs less meaningful*. This is crucial if the goal is to enhance human capacity for quality perception; it’s not only about understanding meaning in a neutral sense but also about perceiving **“goodness” or “aesthetic depth”** in our relations. A potential limitation is that value and quality are often seen as *subjective* or culturally relative, which makes formal modeling tricky. Philosophers of value differ on whether values are objective (real qualities in the world) or wholly subjective. The integrative framework likely leans on a middle path: that quality is **relational** – not merely subjective preference, but not a fixed object property either. It arises in the **relationship between observer and observed**, much like how Gibson’s affordances (to segue into the next point) describe meaning as an emergent property of relation【32†L31-L39】【32†L49-L57】.\n\n- **Indigenous Relational Epistemologies:** Indigenous ways of knowing around the world (from First Nations in the Americas to Māori, to many others) are often cited as *relational* or *holistic*. An **indigenous relational epistemology** is one that sees knowledge as fundamentally born from relationships – between people, communities, land, spirits, and all living things【43†L25-L33】. A succinct definition: *“An epistemology that sees knowing as a process of developing insights by people in relation with one another and with all that exists.”*【43†L25-L33】 In many indigenous traditions, the sharp Western separation between subject and object, or between mind and matter, is not present. Instead, humans are part of an extended family of beings; meaning is understood **communally and ecologically**. For example, a story or ritual may encode layers of relational meaning connecting the tribe with ancestors, animals, and the landscape – perception of meaning here is not an isolated individual event but a **collective, ongoing act, steeped in context**. The **strength** of including this perspective is that it broadens the framework beyond Western assumptions. It brings in concepts like **“all my relations”** (a phrase in many indigenous cultures conveying interconnectedness) and emphasizes qualities like respect, reciprocity, and harmony as central to perceiving meaning. Indeed, an indigenous thinker might say that **meaning *is* the web of relationships** – *“relationships do not merely shape reality, they **are** reality.”*【33†L252-L260】【33†L260-L268】 This resonates strongly with the idea of *relational meaning perception*. It could also enrich the concept of developmental transformations – many indigenous cultures recognize stages of life and rites of passage where one’s *relationship* to the world and sense of meaning transforms (e.g. vision quests, initiation ceremonies leading to a new perception of one’s role in the community and cosmos). A possible challenge or limitation is translating these holistic, narrative, and lived ways of knowing into the language of formal models or scientific validation. There is a risk of **reductionism or misrepresentation** if indigenous knowledge is not engaged respectfully and collaboratively. However, the proposal’s intent to integrate such epistemologies suggests a commitment to **intercultural dialogue** – potentially making the research richer and more inclusive. Indigenous epistemologies also often include a spiritual dimension (e.g. perceiving meaning in dreams, or communication with the land), which might push the comfort zone of conventional science. Yet, this could be precisely where innovation arises – by expanding what counts as relevant data or valid experience.\n\nIn summary, the theoretical underpinnings cover a wide spectrum. **Phenomenology and enactivism** ground the work in **first-person lived experience and interaction**. **Field theory and systems thinking** introduce a **holistic, relational view** of attention and meaning. **Value philosophy** centers the discussion on **quality and goodness**, while **indigenous epistemologies** ensure that **relationality and context** remain front and center, preventing the model from becoming too abstract or culturally narrow. This pluralistic foundation is a major strength of the proposal – it recognizes that understanding something as rich as meaning perception demands multiple lenses. Of course, it also means the theoretical background is quite complex. There may be **tensions among these views** (for instance, a phenomenologist might bristle at certain interpretations of neuroscience; an indigenous elder might have different priorities than a value philosopher). The next sections will examine how the proposal plans to navigate these tensions and what the multi-method approach contributes.\n\n## A Multi-Method Approach: Strengths and Limitations  \nTo tackle such a multifaceted problem, the proposal advocates a **multi-method approach** combining **phenomenological inquiry, intersubjective validation, and formal modeling**. Each of these methodological strands complements the others, but integrating them is an ambitious task. Let’s unpack the strengths and potential limitations of this approach:\n\n- **First-Person Phenomenological Inquiry:** This involves collecting and analyzing data about the *subjective experience* of meaning. Practically, it could mean conducting in-depth interviews or guided introspections where individuals describe how they perceive “quality” or relational meaning in various situations. It might also involve participants keeping reflective journals about shifts in their sense of meaning, especially if developmental transformations are being tracked. The **strengths** of phenomenological inquiry are its **depth and fidelity to lived experience**. It can reveal subtle distinctions – for example, the difference between *merely noticing* something versus *truly sensing its significance*, or how one’s felt sense of a relationship changes after a personal breakthrough. Such nuances might be missed by purely behavioral or quantitative measures. Additionally, phenomenological methods like the **Micro-phenomenology interview technique** (developed by Claire Petitmengin and others) provide rigorous ways to help people articulate their experience, increasing the reliability of first-person reports. However, the limitations are notable: subjective reports are **variable and sometimes unreliable** due to memory biases or interpretation. Two individuals might use the same words to describe different internal events. Moreover, phenomenological data is difficult to generalize – it’s rich but small in sample size. This approach also demands skill – both on the part of participants (who may need training to introspect effectively) and researchers (who must bracket their own biases while analyzing reports). In short, phenomenological inquiry is indispensable for *understanding what needs to be modeled* (the phenomena), but on its own it cannot provide validation that those phenomena are more than idiosyncratic impressions.\n\n- **Intersubjective Validation:** To address the above concerns, the proposal suggests intersubjective or **third-person validation** – essentially, methods to verify that certain experiences or meanings are *shared or reproducible* across individuals. One way to do this is **intersubjective phenomenology**: comparing first-person reports from multiple people to find common structures or themes. If many individuals independently report a similar pattern (say, describing a “field-like” attention in group dialogues, or a “gut feeling” that signals quality in a decision), that lends credence that the phenomenon is real and significant. Another aspect of intersubjective validation is bringing in **external observers or measurements**. For example, while someone describes their experience of deep meaningful engagement, an external measure might track their body language, facial expressions, or even physiological data like heart rate variability (often associated with states of flow or social connectedness). If multiple observers can *observe correlates* of the claimed experience, it bolsters confidence in its reality. The **strength** of intersubjective methods, then, is in providing a bridge between private experience and public science. They enforce a kind of **“social objectivity”**: if a community of inquiry can reach consensus that X experience tends to correspond with Y condition, that finding gains status as knowledge. This is very important for a project that aims to be taken seriously in academic and possibly technological contexts – it cannot rest on one person’s revelations. Intersubjective validation also opens the door to **cross-cultural comparison**: engaging people from different backgrounds to see if certain relational meaning experiences are universal or vary culturally, thus ensuring the model isn’t culture-bound. However, there are tensions here: overly strict validation criteria might **filter out the very subjective richness** we seek to understand. In other words, if we only accept what many people agree on, we might end up focusing on relatively surface phenomena and ignoring deeper but subtler experiences that only some highly trained or sensitive people report. There’s also the risk of **groupthink or suggestibility** – for instance, if participants discuss their experiences together, they might influence each other and converge on descriptions that feel socially acceptable (even in good faith, not consciously). The proposal likely will mitigate this by careful experimental design (perhaps initial independent descriptions, followed by group dialogue for refinement). Another limitation is that some transformative experiences are by nature rare or individual (think of a mystic’s insight or a creative epiphany). Validating those intersubjectively is tricky – it might require *training* others to have similar experiences (as in meditation research, where novices are trained and then their reports compared to expert meditators). In summary, intersubjective validation is crucial for building a *shared framework of meaning*, but it must be handled carefully so as not to prematurely dismiss what only a few can see.\n\n- **Formal Modeling:** This is the third strand – translating insights from the above into **formal models** (mathematical, computational, or at least diagrammatic) that can simulate or represent aspects of meaning perception. The proposal notably suggests developing *five* formal models (topological, vector-field, dynamical systems, participatory, and metastable – analyzed in the next section). The general strengths of formal modeling are **precision, consistency, and generativity**. A formal model forces clarity: one has to specify assumptions and relationships explicitly (e.g. “quality of experience Q increases with factor A up to a threshold, then chaotic behavior ensues” – just as a hypothetical rule). This helps avoid vague theorizing. Models can be **simulated** to see if they produce patterns akin to observed phenomena. For instance, a dynamic systems model might simulate a “sense-making process” between two agents and see if it yields emergent new meanings similar to what humans report in cooperative dialogues【17†L8463-L8471】【17†L8505-L8512】. Formal models can also integrate multi-scale data – one could, say, model how moment-to-moment emotional fluctuations (micro level) accumulate into a stable sense of trust or meaning in a relationship (macro level). Importantly, a formal model allows **predictions**: it might predict what conditions foster deeper quality perception, which can then be empirically tested, thus creating a feedback loop between theory and experiment. The **limitations** of formal modeling in such a human-centered domain are evident as well. Human meaning is complex and context-dependent; any model will be a drastic simplification. There is a danger of **over-formalizing**, where the model starts to dictate what counts as meaning (because it can only capture certain aspects) rather than the phenomena dictating the model. Additionally, developing formal models requires interdisciplinary skills – mathematics, computer simulation, etc. – and the results can become **opaque to non-specialists**. If the goal is accessibility to public audiences (as stated), the model needs intuitive interpretation, not just equations. Another challenge: Which aspects of the phenomenon to formalize? The proposal mentions five different modeling approaches, indicating exploratory breadth. It may be that not all aspects of relational meaning perception are amenable to one type of model – hence trying multiple. This is a strength (flexibility) but also means extra work ensuring these models eventually relate to each other and to the empirical data.\n\n**Synergies and Integration:** The true power of the multi-method approach lies in **combining these methods**. Phenomenological inquiry can generate insights and hypotheses (e.g. “people describe feeling a ‘pull’ towards certain choices that feel high-quality – perhaps a gradient or vector concept”). Intersubjective methods can then test how general that is (“do others also feel this ‘pull’, can they recognize it in each other’s behavior?”). Formal modeling can take that idea of a “pull” and maybe represent it as a vector field in a decision-space, for example, to see if it explains patterns of decision-making. Conversely, the models might highlight gaps – perhaps a model predicts a certain phenomenon that researchers then go looking for phenomenologically. For instance, a dynamical model might suggest that meaning-making has multiple stable states and tipping points; researchers could then look for reports of sudden shifts or phase transitions in people’s sense of meaning (as often happens in therapy or spiritual practice). By iterating between first-person data, shared validation, and modeling, the research can achieve a **robust, well-rounded understanding**. The limitation, of course, is that doing all this is **resource-intensive and requires a team** with diverse expertise. It might be hard for any one researcher to master phenomenological methods, social science methods, and advanced math modeling at once. Collaboration is key (we’ll discuss potential collaborators later). Finally, one has to beware of a **methodological chasm**: qualitative and quantitative approaches sometimes clash in terms of standards of evidence. A phenomenologist might worry that modeling will ignore lived nuance; a modeler might be frustrated by the imprecision of verbal reports. Strong leadership and a unifying vision (the relational meaning framework itself) will be needed to keep the team aligned. Overall, the multi-method strategy is **ambitious but well-justified** by the complexity of the problem – meaning perception is at once deeply subjective, inherently interactive, and potentially formalizable in patterns, so it legitimately spans the **1st-person, 2nd-person (intersubjective), and 3rd-person** perspectives.\n\n## Alternative and Complementary Frameworks  \nThe proposal’s theoretical palette is broad, but it’s important to also consider other frameworks and critiques that could complement or challenge the approach. Several relevant perspectives come to mind: **ecological psychology, post-phenomenology, systems theory (and related complexity science), embodied AI**, and others like integral theory or second-order cybernetics. Exploring these can uncover insights or pitfalls the main approach might miss.\n\n- **Ecological Psychology (Gibson’s Theory of Affordances):** Ecological psychology, pioneered by James J. **Gibson**, offers a highly relevant alternative view of meaning in perception. Gibson introduced the concept of **affordances** – which are essentially the *action possibilities* that the environment offers to an animal. Crucially, he argued that what we perceive are **affordances (meaningful opportunities), not just objective physical properties**【32†L13-L21】【32†L37-L45】. For example, a chair affords “something to sit on,” a ladder affords “climbing,” ice affords “slipping,” etc. In Gibson’s view, **meaning is directly perceived** as an interaction between organism and environment, **“an emergent property of the whole”** organism-environment system【32†L31-L39】. *“Affordances exist neither in the creature nor the world alone... They are an emergent property of the whole.”*【32†L31-L39】 This resonates strongly with the relational philosophy in the proposal. It dissolves the subject-object split by highlighting **complementarity**: *“the world of affordances cannot exist without both a physical environment and a creature that can interact with it… A sidewalk is walk-on-able because of the fit between a flat, rigid surface and a bipedal animal.”*【32†L19-L27】. The **strength** of the ecological approach is its **empirical tractability and clarity** for basic perception. It explains how even “basic meanings” – like a gap that one can step through, or a stove that could burn you – are perceived without cognitive inference【31†L47-L55】【31†L65-L74】. It also shows how meaning is *relative*: what is meaningful depends on the capabilities of the perceiver【32†L43-L51】 (a chair affords sitting to a human but not to a cow, for instance). This ties nicely into developmental aspects: as a child’s abilities grow, their perceived affordances (hence meaningful world) changes【32†L41-L47】. A limitation of Gibson’s original frame is that it focused on immediate, physical meanings in the environment. Affordances are clear for concrete action (e.g. graspable, climbable), but what about more abstract or socially nuanced meanings? The question “how do *profound* or *symbolic* meanings appear to us?” is not fully answered by basic affordances【32†L53-L57】【33†L247-L256】. For instance, the meaning one finds in a cathedral’s quiet or in a piece of music extends beyond simple action possibilities. The proposal could **complement Gibson’s theory with phenomenology and value philosophy** to account for these deeper meanings. Interestingly, some authors have bridged Gibson with other ideas: the Side View article by Benjamin Parry【33†L242-L250】 notes that to extend affordances to “our more impactful moments” of meaning (like awe or moral significance), one might incorporate Christopher **Alexander’s** ideas of wholeness and “the quality without a name.” Alexander, an architect/philosopher, proposed that environments have a degree of **“life” or harmonious order** when forces are balanced【33†L249-L258】, and that humans directly perceive this quality. In Alexander’s terms, high-quality environments or experiences are those where **“all the forces that are part of the whole are harmonized”**, and this *always includes the observer* as part of that whole【33†L252-L260】. So, when we experience a sacred site or a powerful gathering, we feel the larger pattern in harmony, and we ourselves are a “dance partner” in that emergence【33†L260-L268】. This poetic description aligns with the idea that **meaning arises when self and world meet just so**, in a state of balanced interrelation【33†L260-L268】. It effectively marries Gibson’s concrete affordances with a phenomenological sense of **participation in a bigger whole**. For the formal modeling, ecological psychology suggests very practical directions: one could model an agent in an environment and define formal **affordance spaces** (much like robotics and AI do for planning actions). It provides a starting point for modeling meaning as **relational properties** rather than internal symbols【32†L49-L57】. However, pure ecological theory might underplay internal developmental transformations, which the proposal cares about. Thus, it should be seen as complementary: **direct perception of meaning** (ecological) plus **development and reflection** (phenomenological, cultural) together give a full picture.\n\n- **Post-Phenomenology and Philosophy of Technology:** Post-phenomenology, associated with philosophers like Don Ihde, extends phenomenology to consider how **technologies mediate experience**. For example, a smartphone changes how we experience communication and meaning – it introduces new relations (user-phone-world). A post-phenomenological critique might ask: how will formal models themselves, or any technology built on them, mediate our perception of quality? It emphasizes that our tools are not neutral; they shape our relational meaning perception. This is relevant if the end goal includes “technologies and practices to enhance human capacity for quality perception.” If we build, say, a biofeedback app or a training program based on the model, post-phenomenology would urge that we carefully examine how that tool *in turn becomes part of the user’s lifeworld*. A **strength** of this perspective is its focus on **embodiment and mediation** in everyday, modern contexts. It’s a reminder that in the 21st century, much of our meaning-making is augmented (or distorted) by technology (think of social media’s effect on what meanings we pay attention to). Incorporating this view could broaden the proposal’s applicability, ensuring it’s grounded in current human-technology ecosystems. A limitation is that post-phenomenology is largely philosophical and might not directly contribute to formal modeling, but it can act as a **critical lens**. It might also offer alternative concepts like **multistability** (technologies can present multiple stabilities of use/meaning) and **amplification/reduction** (each technology amplifies some aspect of experience while reducing others) which can inform what an “enhancement technology for quality perception” should or shouldn’t do.\n\n- **Systems Theory and Complexity Science:** The proposal already leans in this direction with talk of dynamic systems and metastability. **General Systems Theory** (von Bertalanffy) and **Cybernetics** pioneered thinking about complex wholes and feedback loops. The **Relational-Developmental-Systems** approach in developmental psychology (Lerner, Overton) similarly asserts that development must be understood as a **system of relations over time**【10†L19-L27】. A systems perspective contributes the idea of **emergence** and **nonlinearity**. Meaning perception might be seen as an emergent property of many interacting factors: neurological processes, attention, emotion, culture, context, etc. **Dynamic systems theory** in psychology (e.g. Thelen and Smith’s work on infant development) has shown how new behaviors emerge through self-organization rather than a linear unfolding – perhaps **meaning-making stages** likewise emerge when certain conditions (emotional, cognitive, social) hit a tipping point. One could think of **developmental transformations of meaning** as *phase transitions* in a complex system of mind, body, and society. For instance, the leap of insight someone has during adolescence or mid-life could be modeled as the system reorganizing to a higher-order pattern (analogous to water turning to ice – new structure). **Metastability** – maintaining flexible coordination – is already highlighted as a key concept; it comes directly from coordination dynamics in complex systems science【18†L139-L147】【18†L140-L148】. *“Coordination Dynamics proposes a mechanism called metastability, a subtle blend of integration and segregation”*【18†L139-L147】. This means parts of a system (like brain regions, or people in a group) **keep their autonomy yet also synchronize temporarily**, allowing creativity and fluid change【18†L139-L147】【18†L141-L148】. Such a state could underlie optimal meaning-making: if one is too rigidly integrated (locked into a single perspective) or too segregated (disconnected), quality perception suffers – but if one is metastable (able to connect and disconnect flexibly), one can perceive new meanings and adapt. The **strength** of systems/complexity theory is that it provides many **formal tools** (network analysis, simulations, nonlinear dynamics equations) that could enrich the modeling aspect. It also naturally handles **multi-factor and multi-scale phenomena**, which meaning perception surely is. Additionally, systems thinking has a **holistic ethos** that resonates with both indigenous worldview and gestalt field theory – it discourages reduction to single causes. A possible critique from systems theory might be that the proposal sounds very ambitious in scope – and in systems language, a system that tries to include “everything” might become unwieldy. Systems scientists might advise identifying the **key subsystems** and their relationships to model (e.g. an attentional subsystem, an affective subsystem, and a social interaction subsystem and see how they couple). Another limitation is that while systems theory gives a conceptual language, one must be careful to still tie it to humanly *meaningful* categories. It’s easy to get lost in complexity jargon (order parameters, strange attractors) in a way that is hard to relate to the lived experience (though sometimes these technical terms do map surprisingly well – e.g. an **attractor** in phase space might correspond to a **habitual meaning frame** in life). Overall, bringing in systems thinking is almost necessary for a project about relational meaning, since by definition we are dealing with *systems of relations*. The proposal seems to embrace this; alternative angles within systems thinking – like **second-order cybernetics** (which emphasizes that the observer is part of the system observed) – would strongly support the integration of first-person perspective (the modeler and the participants are part of the “system” of research itself).\n\n- **Embodied AI and Cognitive Modeling:** Another complementary domain is **embodied artificial intelligence** and robotics, which essentially put enactivist and ecological principles into practice in machines. Researchers in embodied AI attempt to have robots or agents **learn meaning from interaction** rather than through pre-programmed symbol processing. For instance, an AI agent equipped with sensors might be tasked to discover what objects in its environment “afford” and develop its own internal representations. Projects in AI that draw on **conceptual spaces** (Gärdenfors) represent meanings geometrically (points in a quality space), and those drawing on neural networks might incidentally create internal vector spaces that correlate with human-interpretable qualities. The relevance here is twofold: First, embodied AI can serve as a **testbed for theories of meaning** – if an AI with certain algorithms can develop rudimentary sense-making, that lends support to those algorithms as a model of human sense-making. Conversely, if our formal model of relational meaning is good, we might implement it in an AI to give it more human-like understanding or better human-aligned values. Second, AI and machine learning offer practical **modeling tools**: for example, one could use a neural network to model how humans map raw experience to perceived meaning, and then analyze the network to see what patterns it’s picking up. **Strengths** of engaging with AI include access to a vast body of knowledge on learning and adaptation, which parallels human developmental learning. It also forces addressing **computational tractability** – any formal model intended for technology might converge with AI approaches. There is also an ethical angle: as AI systems play bigger roles in our lives, ensuring they operate with a notion of “quality” or relational meaning (not just narrow goals) could be crucial, and the proposal’s work might contribute to that by formalizing how entities can perceive quality. A critique from the embodied AI side might be that the proposal leans heavily on human subjective reports, whereas an engineer might say “let’s just build a model that works and not worry if it matches folk descriptions.” There can be a productive tension here – the human-centric approach ensures relevance, while the AI approach ensures rigor and implementation. One must also be cautious: AI models are **simplifications** and often lack the rich social-cultural context humans have. So results from AI simulations of meaning (if attempted) should not be uncritically mapped back to humans without validation.\n\nIn addition to the above, one could mention **Integral Theory or Meta-theories** that have attempted broad integrations (Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory, for example, explicitly tries to unite first-person, second-person, third-person perspectives in a framework of human development). Such frameworks might provide a ready-made structure (Wilber’s AQAL model, etc.), but they also come with their own conceptual baggage and are debated in academic circles. The proposal’s approach is more grounded in specific scholarly traditions, which might be more palatable to researchers, but being aware of these integrative philosophies can help avoid “reinventing the wheel.” \n\n**Summary of Alternatives:** Ecological psychology contributes a **direct realism** about meaning (we see meaning in the world through our abilities)【32†L49-L57】, which aligns well with enactivism. Post-phenomenology reminds us to consider **mediation and technology** in meaning-making. Systems theory provides **holistic, dynamic tools** to formalize complex interactions, crucial for development over time and multi-agent scenarios. Embodied AI offers **practical modeling and testing ground** for theories and cautions us to think in implementable terms. By engaging with these frameworks, the research can strengthen its theoretical robustness, avoid known pitfalls, and perhaps discover new explanatory metaphors (like affordances, feedback loops, etc.) that enrich the integrative framework. These perspectives are largely complementary – remarkably, none of them fundamentally contradict the proposal’s core intuition that meaning is relational and can be studied both from within and from outside. Instead, they each highlight different facets: the **environment’s role (ecological)**, the **tools’ role (post-phenomenology)**, the **whole system behavior (complexity)**, and the **algorithmic learnability (AI)** of meaning perception. The challenge will be to judiciously incorporate insights from these without getting overwhelmed, maintaining a coherent approach.\n\n## Unifying Subjective Experience and Intersubjective Validation  \nA central tension in the project is how to **honor the richness of first-person experience (subjectivity)** while also achieving **reliable, shareable knowledge (intersubjectivity/third-person)**. Bridging this gap is a well-known challenge often referred to as the **“explanatory gap”** or even the “hard problem” when it comes to consciousness. For meaning perception specifically, the tension might manifest as: *We have individuals describing profound experiences of meaning or quality; how do we know these aren’t just personal idiosyncrasies or even self-delusions? Conversely, if we only trust what multiple observers agree on, do we flatten out the most valuable insights that come from singular, subjective depths?*\n\n**Tensions Identified:**  \nOn one side, **subjective phenomenology** can be **highly private** – only *I* have access to how something deeply moves me. Traditional scientific methods might consider this “anecdotal.” On the other side, **intersubjective validation** aims for **objectivity**, but can be **insensitive to context and nuance** – laboratory measures might miss the point, or group consensus might miss minority experiences. There’s also a philosophical tension: phenomenology (especially in the Husserlian tradition) was about returning “to the things themselves,” often bracketing out third-person theories, whereas science tends to remain third-person and bracket out first-person subjectivities. Merging them requires methodological innovation.\n\n**Strategies to Unify Methodologically:**  \nOne promising pathway is the approach of **“Neurophenomenology,”** introduced by Francisco Varela【18†L136-L144】. Neurophenomenology is essentially a marriage of first-person reports with neuroscientific data, using each to inform the other. Participants might undergo training to report on their experience with high fidelity, while simultaneously measurements (like EEG) are taken; the first-person data is then used to structure the analysis of the neural data. The underlying principle – which applies here – is to create **“bridging constraints”**: use phenomenological insights to constrain the interpretation of objective data, and use objective data to validate and refine phenomenological insights. In our context, instead of neural data, we might have **behavioral or linguistic or interaction data** as the third-person layer. For example, if phenomenology identifies that people experiencing deep meaning often describe a feeling of expansion and openness, the researchers might operationalize “expansion” in behavioral terms (open postures, longer gaze durations, or maybe something like physiological arousal but with relaxation). They could then see if those markers indeed occur when people *say* they are having a meaningful moment. Conversely, if some interactions (say group dialogues) are observed to have certain measurable dynamics (like everyone’s turn-taking is very balanced, or there are synchronized pauses), researchers could ask: do those correlate with participants *reporting* a high sense of meaning or quality in the conversation? \n\nAnother methodology is **Micro-phenomenology coupled with statistical analysis**. Micro-phenomenology allows deriving a fine-grained description of an experience (like the steps of how an insight dawns on someone). If done with many participants, one can extract a **“generic structure”** of that experience. This structure can be considered a hypothesis that can be tested or at least looked for in other contexts. For example, it might turn out that whenever people have a certain kind of realization of meaning, they go through stages (confusion, a physical breath, a metaphor emerges, then a feeling of clarity). This pattern, once described, could be validated by new participants or by seeing if some stages can be objectively induced or observed. In this way, **subjective patterns become intersubjectively available** – others can recognize them, language can be developed to talk about them, and even experimental designs can be built around them (“let’s try to induce stage 2 by giving a subtle hint and see if stage 3 follows in reports”).\n\nOne potent way to unify subjective and intersubjective is through **participatory methods**. If multiple individuals co-experience and then share their first-person perspectives with each other in a guided setting, the experience itself can evolve into a kind of **shared phenomenology**. For instance, in a pair or group, people might describe in real-time what they’re noticing in the interaction (“I feel a warmth in how you said that,” “When you mentioned your story, I felt a connection to my own life”). This requires trust and training, but it effectively creates an **intersubjective phenomenological dialogue**. The researcher can act as facilitator. Over time, participants might converge on a common description of what meaning emerged for the group and how. This is both data (for the researcher) and a validation among the participants that they weren’t imagining things individually. It’s like performing meaning-making and observing it at the same time. Such **reflective practice** is used in fields like Gestalt therapy or Bohmian dialogue groups to increase collective awareness of experience. For science, it yields rich qualitative data that is already intersubjectively validated to a degree (because the group agrees “yes, that happened between us”). The limitation is that it’s hard to scale and still quite qualitative – but it could be combined with recording the sessions (to later code behaviors, etc.).\n\nMethodologically, another unifier is to use **mixed methods designs**. For example, a study could involve **quantitative surveys or scales** of perceived meaning (there are questionnaires in positive psychology about meaning in life, engagement, flow, etc.), alongside **open-ended interviews**. The quantitative part provides broad validation (“80% of people scored higher on meaning after X intervention”), and the qualitative part explains *how* and *what* they experienced. If both align (people say it was meaningful and the scores confirm it), then we have intersubjective validation; if they diverge, that’s interesting too (maybe the scale wasn’t capturing the nuance).\n\nA potential critique is that by seeking intersubjective validation, one might **over-objectify** phenomenology, losing sight of *phenomenology’s philosophical roots*. Phenomenologists like Zahavi or Merleau-Ponty might caution: don’t treat first-person reports as just data points, they are expressions of a life-world. The proposed solution is likely an *iterative dialogue* between the approaches, rather than trying to collapse one into the other. In practice, this might mean holding regular team meetings where the phenomenology experts and modeling experts exchange findings and adjust their approaches accordingly. Over time, they develop a **common vocabulary** that respects both the subjective descriptors and the scientific terms.\n\nOne interesting way to unify perspectives is to create **visualizations** that can be viewed both as art and as science output. For example, perhaps from formal modeling or data analysis, one could generate a **topological map** of an individual’s meaning landscape (with peaks of significance, valleys of mundane experience, etc.). Presenting that back to the individual and asking if it resonates with their lived sense could serve as a validation. If it does, it’s a success of bridging (the map captured something real for the person), and if not, that feedback improves the model. \n\n**The Role of Development:** Since the question specifically mentions tracking developmental transformations, it’s worth noting that unifying subjective and objective is particularly important over time. A person at one developmental stage might not even *have language* to describe experiences that they will have at a later stage. So researchers might need to use **different methods at different stages**. Early in development (childhood, or early in someone’s journey of learning a skill), one might rely more on external observation (because the person can’t articulate fully). Later, the person can give richer introspective accounts. Methodologically unifying across development might mean always having a combination of measures but shifting the emphasis. For example, with children, focus more on behavioral indicators of meaning (like how deeply they explore a task, or facial expressions of fascination) and less on self-report; with adults, introduce more self-reflection and narrative.\n\nFinally, a philosophical point: Perhaps the proposal aspires to a **unitary epistemology** where first-person and third-person are just different *viewpoints* on the same underlying reality of relational meaning. If so, one way to unify is adopt something like a **“dual aspect theory”**: akin to how a coin has two sides, experience and science are two sides of the coin of reality. This perspective can be reassuring to the team – they’re not trying to prove one side *with* the other, but rather to show they cohere as one. In practice, it translates to always interpreting results in a **bi-directional way**: if a formal model works, ask what phenomenological reality it corresponds to; if a phenomenological insight is found, ask how it might show up in observable data.\n\nIn summary, **to unify subjective and intersubjective methods, the project will likely employ iterative, mixed-method designs, use concepts that naturally link first-person and third-person (like participatory sense-making, which is already an interaction concept), and cultivate a team culture that values both types of knowledge**. By using individuals’ experiences as both input and checkpoint for models, and using models to inspire new questions for experience, the gap can be narrowed. This reflective, integrative methodology is itself a novel contribution – it demonstrates a way to do science that is not “third-person only” but genuinely **includes first-person perspective as a valid source of data**. If successful, it could serve as a template for other hard-to-measure phenomena in psychology and human science.\n\n## Evaluating the Proposed Formal Models of Meaning Perception  \nThe proposal envisions developing five formal models or formalisms to capture relational meaning perception: **(1) Topological, (2) Vector Field, (3) Dynamic Systems, (4) Participatory Sense-Making,** and **(5) Metastable Dynamics** models. Each of these approaches comes with its own theoretical connotations and technical apparatus. Let’s examine what each might entail, their potential strengths, and any concerns or limitations regarding feasibility and originality.\n\n### 1. Topological Models of Meaning  \nA **topological model** suggests using concepts from topology – the mathematics of shape, continuity, and connectedness – to represent meaning and quality. What might this look like? One interpretation is that the **space of meanings** or experiences is conceived as a **topological space**, where points represent specific experiential states and the topology (neighborhoods, holes, boundaries) represents how those states relate or transform into one another. Topology concerns itself with properties that remain invariant under continuous deformations. If we apply that to meaning perception, we might be interested in **invariants in someone’s sense-making** as it develops. For example, perhaps different life experiences that feel “connected” or similar form a continuous region in an individual’s meaning-space, whereas a major life transformation is like moving through a narrow passage (a “neck” in the topology) into a new region of understanding.\n\nIn psychology, a precedent for topological modeling comes again from **Kurt Lewin’s field theory**. Lewin literally used topological diagrams – drawing regions (he called them “cells” or areas) representing different situations or goals, with boundaries representing barriers, etc.【40†L21-L30】【42†L142-L150】. By deforming these shapes, he could represent how a person’s life space changes. Similarly, one could imagine a topological representation of an individual’s value landscape: areas of high perceived quality might be like attractor basins or simply marked regions.\n\nAnother idea is to use modern techniques like **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**. TDA is a branch of data science that extracts topological features (like clusters, loops, voids) from complex high-dimensional data. If participants provide rich data (like similarity ratings between experiences, or even textual descriptions), one could use TDA to see if the “shape” of meanings can be characterized. For instance, do people have *“loops”* of experiences (meaning cycles they return to) or *“holes”* (gaps in their experience that might represent something like an unfulfilled desire)? Such patterns could correlate with developmental stages (a matured worldview might “fill in” a hole that was present in earlier understanding).\n\n**Strengths of a topological approach:** It is *qualitative-mathematical*, focusing on relations rather than exact numeric values. This suits the domain because meaning is often about **relations (this reminds me of that, this leads to that)**. Topology can capture *continuous change* very naturally – developmental transformations might be seen as continuous deformations of one’s meaning-space, punctuated perhaps by a change in topology (like a donut shape turning into a sphere shape, metaphorically speaking, when a “hole” in understanding is filled). It also can accommodate **individual differences** without requiring that everyone’s space is identical – one can study the topology of each person’s meaning-space and then compare qualitatively. This might align with indigenous or personal narratives, which are more about *patterns* than numbers.\n\n**Limitations or challenges:** Topology is abstract. Translating real human data into topological terms requires a lot of interpretation. We might end up with a pretty diagram that is hard to validate – how do we know if a person’s “meaning torus” (for instance) truly corresponds to their lived experience? The project will need concrete data to feed into such models. Possibly, network graphs of concepts from interviews could be one input (concept networks have topologies that can be analyzed). Another challenge is that topology generally doesn’t incorporate dynamics by itself (it’s static shape); it might need to be combined with the dynamic systems model to study evolution of the topology over time. There is also a question of originality: While Lewin’s work was an early topological psychology, it is not mainstream today, so applying modern topology to meaning would be quite original. Some cognitive scientists have used topology in understanding consciousness (e.g., topological theories of the *qualia space*【19†L37-L44】). The originality here would be focusing on **relational meaning** specifically and possibly integrating value dimensions into a topological structure (imagine an n-dimensional space where axes are not simple physical measures but qualities or values).\n\nFeasibility-wise, building a topological model might be doable with small data and more conceptual reasoning, but demonstrating its usefulness would require careful case studies or visualizations. It might remain somewhat metaphorical unless backed by data techniques like TDA.\n\n### 2. Vector Field Models of Meaning  \nA **vector field model** implies that we view the process of meaning-making as akin to a field of forces with directions and magnitudes at each point in some space. In concrete terms, we might imagine that at any given state of a person (or a relationship), there are **forces acting on the attention or intention** – arrows pointing towards certain attractors (things that seem meaningful, “worth it”) or pointing away from repellers (things that seem meaningless or unpleasant). For example, during a conversation, one could imagine a “vector” representing the pull of a particular topic or the urge to change the subject; or in life choices, vectors toward career, family, etc., based on perceived value.\n\nThis again echoes **Lewin’s use of vectors** – he spoke of “force fields” where, say, a child is attracted by a candy (positive valence) and repelled by a scolding parent (negative valence), and the resultant behavior is like the resultant of those force vectors. In a more mature context, think of how a person might feel *torn* between two meaningful pursuits – this could be modeled as two vectors in different directions.\n\nAnother domain where vector-field models have been used is **neural network attractor dynamics** – for instance, in understanding how cognitive states evolve, one can represent the change of neural activation as movement in a state space guided by a vector field (given by differential equations). If we had a quantitative state representation for meaning (perhaps derived from physiological or behavioral measures), we could attempt to fit a vector field that describes how state transitions occur. Even without heavy math, one could conceptualize something like **“gradients of meaning”** – similar to the idea of following a gradient uphill to higher value (this parallels concepts in reinforcement learning in AI, where an agent follows reward gradients).\n\n**Strengths:** A vector field formalism brings in the notion of **directionality and dynamics** explicitly. It’s very useful for modeling **attention** – many models of attention in cognitive science (e.g., dynamic field theory) use “activation fields” that evolve over time via differential equations. One might, for example, model a **field of attention** across various aspects of a situation, where each aspect has a certain “attractive force” proportional to its perceived relevance or value. This could formalize how one’s focus shifts – essentially treating attention as a particle moving in a field of affordances. The vector field approach is quite concrete for simulations: one can set initial conditions and see where the “meaning-seeking agent” ends up, which might simulate making a decision or interpreting a scene.\n\nAlso, vector fields can incorporate **stochasticity** – little random perturbations – which might represent creativity or personal variation in meaning-making (someone might occasionally wander off the expected path to discover a new meaning, analogous to a random jump in the field).\n\n**Limitations:** A pure vector field model might oversimplify motivation and meaning. Real humans can defy the “forces” (e.g., act against their immediate impulses due to reflection or moral principles), whereas a vector field model usually would just follow the resultant force. We might need to incorporate higher-order dynamics or switching of fields to account for deliberation. Additionally, to define a vector field, one needs to specify the **state space** – what are the axes? If it's something like “distance from an ideal self” vs “distance from social approval” (just an example 2D space), we could have a vector at each point showing how the person tends to move. But picking those axes is tricky – it might come from the phenomenological data (common concerns or values that structure people’s sense-making).\n\nAnother limitation: if the state space is high-dimensional, visualizing or intuitively understanding the vector field is hard. However, one can sometimes reduce it to a few principal dimensions for explanation.\n\n**Originality and Feasibility:** Psychology doesn’t often talk about vector fields explicitly, but under the hood many cognitive models are essentially vector fields (like certain neural network models or the Haken-Kelso-Bunz model of coordination【22†L269-L279】【22†L283-L291】). Applying it to meaning perception is novel. It’s feasible if one can quantify aspects of meaning – perhaps through a combination of self-report scales (mapped as coordinates) and measured tendencies. Even without precise quantification, a qualitative vector diagram can be a useful heuristic tool (like mapping out someone’s “forces” in a counseling session – which therapists informally do).\n\n### 3. Dynamical Systems Models  \nA **dynamical systems model** is a broad category that includes vector fields but also any formal model defining how a system’s state evolves over time according to certain rules (often differential equations or iterative mappings). The dynamical systems approach would likely be the umbrella that can encompass the above two (topological and vector field) as specific instances (topology describing the state space properties, vector field describing state change). But beyond that, dynamic systems allow for features like **attractors, limit cycles, bifurcations, chaos**, etc., which could all be relevant to meaning-making.\n\nFor example, one might hypothesize that people have **attractor states** of meaning – stable interpretations or worldviews that they fall into. A **developmental transformation** might correspond to a **bifurcation**, where an old attractor loses stability and a new one emerges (metaphorically, a mindset that used to make sense no longer does, and a new way of making meaning appears). This is reminiscent of how children transition through Piagetian stages – one could model those as dynamic regimes. In adult meaning-making, shifting from, say, a self-centered worldview to a relational worldview might be seen as a non-linear phase shift.\n\nDynamical models can also capture **time scales**: fast dynamics (momentary fluctuations of attention or emotion) and slow dynamics (long-term learning or stage change). Possibly, metastability (coming next) fits into this as a dynamic regime.\n\n**Strengths:** Dynamic systems are extremely powerful for capturing **nonlinear, history-dependent processes**. Human sense-making likely has path dependence (your past meanings affect how new ones form) – a dynamic model can include state memory or feedback loops. They can also incorporate **multi-component coupling** (like modeling the person and environment as two coupled dynamical systems influencing each other, which is the spirit of enactivism). For instance, one could extend models used in coordination dynamics of two people moving together to two people *meaning-making* together. If each person’s meaning state oscillates or shifts, their coupling (communication) could synchronize them or lead to new collective patterns.\n\nA dynamical approach is also amenable to **computer simulation**, which means hypotheses can be tested in silico before (or alongside) real-world testing. It encourages thinking about **stability vs change** explicitly – e.g., what keeps a meaning stable, what triggers a change. Moreover, dynamical systems theory has a mature mathematical foundation, so there is a wealth of known behaviors (like the famous butterfly effect, etc.) which could inspire thinking (perhaps small events can lead to big changes in someone’s meaning system – analogous to chaos in weather).\n\n**Limitations:** The more complex one makes a dynamical model (to be realistic), the more parameters one has to estimate, and the more data is needed to fit it. There’s a risk of building a beautiful dynamic model that can produce virtually any behavior by tuning, thus explaining everything and nothing. It’s essential to constrain it with empirical findings (hence the multi-method approach feeding into it). Simpler models might miss important factors. Another difficulty is communicability: explaining a dynamic model with equations to non-mathematicians (or even to other researchers) can be hard; one might rely on metaphors or simulations with an interface.\n\nFeasibility depends on scope: modeling one specific aspect (say, the dynamics of attention in a mindfulness practice context as it relates to perceived meaningfulness) is feasible and has been done in various guises. Trying to model a whole psyche or a whole culture’s meaning dynamics is far harder. Likely the project would start with *minimal models* – like how physicists start with simple models to capture key phenomena (e.g., a few coupled differential equations to model participatory sense-making oscillation【17†L8463-L8471】【17†L8479-L8487】). As understanding grows, layers of complexity can be added.\n\nIn terms of originality: applying dynamical systems to cognitive and social processes is not new (there’s even a journal called *Dynamical Psychology*), but doing so in the context of “quality perception” and bridging phenomenology is fairly original. Past work by Varela on using dynamical systems for cognition, or J.A. Scott Kelso’s work on social coordination, are precedents【11†L13-L21】【11†L41-L45】. This project could be seen as extending those into the domain of meaning and value explicitly. The integrative nature (tying phenomenology to dynamics) was advocated by Varela – so one could say it’s building on the “neurophenomenology” paradigm, making it a “dynamical phenomenology of meaning.” That is a novel synthesis, if not an entirely unheard-of idea.\n\n### 4. Participatory Sense-Making Models  \nThe phrase **participatory sense-making** comes from enactive cognitive science, specifically the work of De Jaegher and Di Paolo (2007) on social cognition. It refers to the process by which two or more agents **actively participate in each other’s sense-making**, creating **new meanings in interaction that neither could create alone**【17†L8463-L8471】【17†L8505-L8512】. This concept is less about a specific mathematical formalism (though it has been described with dynamical systems) and more about a theoretical model of social interaction. However, the proposal lists it as one of the “formal models,” suggesting that the researchers might formalize participatory sense-making perhaps via network or game-theoretic models, or multi-agent systems simulations.\n\nIn participatory sense-making, **intersubjectivity** takes center stage. For example, imagine two people in conversation: as they coordinate their actions and words, they develop a shared understanding or meaning that is **co-constructed**. A classical example given is a conversation where, through the give-and-take (including misunderstandings and repairs), a new insight emerges that neither person had at the start【17†L8499-L8507】【17†L8501-L8509】. This is an emergent phenomenon of the interaction. The original authors describe it as *“the coordination of intentional activity in interaction, whereby individual sense-making processes are affected and new domains of social sense-making can be generated that were not available to each individual on their own”*【17†L8463-L8471】. In other words, interacting has its own dynamics and can lay a groundwork (a “socio-normative backdrop”【17†L8469-L8477】) against which things gain shared meaning.\n\nTo formalize this, one might use **agent-based modeling**: simulate two (or many) agents with simple internal sense-making rules, and an interaction loop, and see what global patterns result. For instance, agents might be modeled as dynamical systems themselves (with states representing their internal meaning or intent) and a coupling term representing communication. One could then analyze the **joint system** for emergent states (like synchronization corresponding to mutual understanding, or oscillation corresponding to turn-taking, etc.). In fact, there has been work in this direction; some researchers have modeled social interaction patterns with coupled oscillators or information flows.\n\nAnother approach is more qualitative but structured: **conversation analysis** or **interaction process modeling** can be formalized using notation and logic rules (like how moves in a dialogue affect the “common ground”). A participatory sense-making model might use something like **game theory** too – conceptualizing an interaction as a game where the players’ payoff is meaningful understanding, and they coordinate (not exactly compete) to achieve it. Cooperative game theory or joint intentionality frameworks (like Michael Tomasello’s work on shared intentionality) could be relevant.\n\n**Strengths:** Incorporating participatory sense-making ensures the framework accounts for **social and relational context explicitly**, not just individual cognition. It resonates with the **indigenous and spiritual emphasis on relationship** (meaning is often not a solo enterprise, but something that arises in community or in communion). Formally, it can produce very **rich behavior** from fairly simple rules – showing how complexity arises from interaction. It also allows modeling **intersubjective validation as part of the phenomenon itself**: rather than treating intersubjective agreement as just a method, it becomes part of what we’re explaining (how do people come to agree on meaning?).\n\nOne of the **key contributions** of participatory sense-making concept is highlighting that **certain meanings *only* exist at the collective level**【17†L8505-L8512】. For example, inside jokes between two friends, or the feeling of synergy in a team – you can’t reduce those purely to one individual’s experience; they are inherently relational. A formal model capturing that (say a variable that only activates when both agents are in certain states together) would be novel and useful, especially in an era where we value collaboration and collective intelligence.\n\n**Limitations:** Social interactions are exceedingly complex, and cultural differences abound. Building a generic model for participatory sense-making that is not trivial (i.e., more than just “agents mirror each other and thus agree”) is challenging. The original literature on participatory sense-making is conceptual; formal models have been exploratory. The project will need to pick manageable scenarios of interaction to model – perhaps dyadic conversation, or parent-child interaction, or therapist-client, etc. It might also need to integrate this with the individual models: each agent in participatory modeling might itself have a topological/dynamic model of its own meaning-making, which then couples – this quickly becomes high-dimensional. \n\nHowever, one could simplify by focusing on the **coordination dynamics** aspect: for instance, represent each agent’s readiness to engage on a certain topic as an oscillator and study how they entrain. Or treat turn-taking as a limit cycle. Simplified models can yield insights (like how timing and rhythm affect sense-making, which is something studied in communication research – e.g., interactional synchrony).\n\nOriginality in this area would be high because while participatory sense-making is discussed in cognitive science, few if any have tried to formalize *quality perception* through this lens. It might break new ground in showing how *shared quality perception* (e.g., collective aesthetic experiences or moral agreement moments) can be modeled.\n\nIn terms of feasibility, one advantage is that multi-agent simulations can often be built with adjustable complexity. The team could start with simple rule-based agents (like each agent chooses to either echo or diverge from the other’s last statement based on an internal parameter) and then see what patterns of mutual meaning-making occur. Even simple cellular automata or boolean networks might be tried to capture idea spread and co-creation in groups.\n\n### 5. Metastable Dynamics Models  \n**Metastability** refers to a state of a system that is neither fully stable (locked in one pattern) nor totally unstable, but something in-between that allows **flexible switching** among multiple states. In brain science, as cited, metastability has been proposed as a key principle for how the brain integrates and segregates activities【18†L139-L147】【18†L141-L148】. A metastable system can hover around multiple possible patterns without committing to one permanently, enabling adaptability【18†L139-L147】.\n\nTranslating this to meaning perception: a metastable dynamics model might suggest that a healthy meaning-making system has multiple latent states (multiple perspectives or interpretations, for instance) and it can move between them as context changes, rather than getting stuck in one rigid meaning. At the same time, it doesn’t fly apart into incoherence – there’s some integrative force keeping it together. For example, a person might have various facets to their identity (professional, personal, spiritual, etc.) which give different senses of meaning; in a metastable regime, they can contextually shift among these (be in “professional mode” at work and “family mode” at home, etc.) without losing the overall self. If the system became too stable, they might be unable to adapt (imagine someone who cannot compartmentalize and brings work stress into home life, ruining both), and if it’s too unstable, they might feel fragmented.\n\nAnother example is in social interaction: a conversation might hover between different topics or emotional tones, never settling too long, but also not random – this can often be the most fruitful kind of dialogue, where new insights pop out (as opposed to being stuck on one topic or completely chaotic jumping).\n\nTo formalize metastable dynamics, one usually uses dynamic systems that have either multiple attractors that are weak (not deep wells) or no attractors but tendencies. Often models like coupled oscillators with slight detuning can exhibit metastability: they don’t lock in phase (which would be full synchronization) but also don’t drift completely separately – they repeatedly come together and apart. In fact, Kelso and others have used such models to describe interpersonal coordination【11†L13-L21】【11†L41-L45】, and one could extend those to coordination of meaning or attention.\n\n**Strengths:** Metastability is a very enticing concept because it captures **balance of integration and flexibility**【18†L139-L147】, which intuitively seems important for perceiving quality (one needs a stable sense of self or criteria to evaluate quality, but also openness to new emergent quality). Metastable models could potentially explain phenomena like **flow states** (which are highly integrated with the task yet adaptable moment by moment) or **group resonance** (where a group is neither a set of individuals doing their own thing nor a rigid chorus, but something in between where harmonies emerge spontaneously). The literature even suggests metastability might underlie “creative sparks” because systems hover near multiple patterns, making novel connections possible【11†L39-L47】.\n\nMathematically, one can measure metastability in simulations (e.g., by measuring the variance of phase differences, etc., or the duration distributions of visits to quasi-stable states). If empirical data (like physiological or linguistic) from interactions or individuals is available, one might attempt to measure metastability in those signals to see if higher metastability correlates with, say, higher reported meaning. For example, in a brainstorming session judged as very meaningful by participants, you might see brain or behavioral dynamics that are metastable, whereas a dull, meaningless meeting might show either very rigid turn-taking or total chaos.\n\n**Limitations:** Metastability as a concept might be a bit **esoteric for general audiences** without explanation. It is also typically used in highly controlled quantitative studies (like coordination of finger tapping between people). Expanding it to the domain of \"meaning\" could be difficult to operationalize. The project may need a proxy (like measuring variance in conversational dynamics or neural coherence patterns as a sign of metastability). Another limitation is that metastability might be a *property of the other models rather than a separate model itself*. It could be that once you build a dynamic or participatory model, you then explore if it operates in a metastable regime. So “metastable dynamics” might not be an entirely independent model, but a **target regime** to explore in any dynamic model.\n\nOriginality: linking metastability to quality of perception is quite new. There is some related notion in positive psychology or philosophy – people talk about the **“edge of chaos”** as a state of high creativity and vitality (which is essentially metastability: between order and disorder). But rigorous treatment in context of human meaning hasn’t been done much. So this could be a novel contribution: demonstrating that when people report optimal meaning, their internal/interactional dynamics are at that edge-of-chaos: *“no such thing as perfect order or randomness” as one paper described metastable coordination【11†L23-L30】.* \n\n**Feasibility:** If the team has someone with expertise in nonlinear dynamics, analyzing metastability is feasible using existing metrics. It requires time-series data usually. If the project can get continuous data of some sort (e.g., real-time ratings, physiological signals, or dense behavioral coding), they can apply these methods. Alternatively, they might just use the concept qualitatively (e.g., note from interviews that meaningful times are often described as balanced between routine and surprise – a narrative analog to metastability).\n\n### General Evaluation of the Five Models  \nUsing five distinct yet related formalisms may seem overly complex, but each offers a lens on the phenomenon:\n\n- **Topological**: emphasizes *structure* (the form of meaning-space).\n- **Vector Field**: emphasizes *forces and gradients* (the immediate motivations in meaning-making).\n- **Dynamic Systems**: emphasizes *temporal evolution and complex behavior* (how meanings change and persist).\n- **Participatory Sense-Making**: emphasizes *interaction and emergence* (how meanings form socially).\n- **Metastable Dynamics**: emphasizes the *regime of operation* (the balance of stability/flexibility in the above processes).\n\nOne can see them as **complementary components of a single integrated model**. For example, one might ultimately envision a person’s meaning-making as a dynamical system operating in a topological space of meanings under certain vector-field forces, and when two people interact, their systems couple, ideally in a metastable way, yielding participatory sense-making. That sentence just packed all five into one conceptual model – which suggests it’s possible to integrate them. \n\nThe feasibility of developing all five in one project will depend on scope and time. Perhaps the intent is to explore all, then focus on the most promising or find a unification. Originality is high: individually, some have precedents (dynamics, participatory models in other contexts), but as a suite applied to this question, it’s novel. It’s somewhat akin to how modern physics needed both particle and wave models, and then unified via quantum theory – here maybe multiple models will later be unified into a single “Integrative Framework for Relational Meaning” which might incorporate all as special cases or perspectives.\n\nOne risk is **fragmentation**: if each model yields separate insights but they are not reconciled, it could confuse rather than clarify. So a plan to interrelate them is important. For example, results of participatory modeling could inform parameters in the dynamic model, or topology could provide the state space for the vector field model.\n\nIn terms of evaluation: Each model’s success could be judged by how well it accounts for certain aspects of data or experience:\n- Topology: Does it capture developmental stage differences (maybe one stage has an extra “hole” that the next stage fills, etc.)?\n- Vector Field: Does it predict short-term choices or attention shifts accurately?\n- Dynamics: Does it reproduce trajectories of change we observe (e.g., sudden insight moments vs gradual learning)?\n- Participatory: Does it simulate known group phenomena (like common ground formation, or the fact that two heads can be better than one in problem-solving sometimes)?\n- Metastability: Does it correlate with indicators of high-quality perception (are the best experiences indeed metastable in dynamics)?\n\nIf even some of these hold true, it would be a big step in formalizing such an elusive concept as “quality perception.” It’s also possible the research finds one approach clearly outperforms or is more useful than others. For instance, maybe everything they want can be captured with a dynamic field model (combining vector field and dynamics) and the topology was not needed explicitly. Or vice versa, maybe a static topological representation ends up being the clearest communication tool, and dynamics just serve to explain how one moves in that landscape. The openness to five approaches suggests an exploratory spirit – which is good scientifically, as long as it converges.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, having multiple formal approaches can engage different collaborators (mathematicians may like topology, physicists dynamics, etc.) and also yield multiple publishable pieces in different communities (e.g. a paper to a complexity journal on metastability findings, another to a cognitive science journal on participatory modeling). \n\nIn conclusion for this section: The five proposed formal models are **ambitious but cover complementary facets** of meaning perception. They collectively push the frontier by treating meaning not as a static mental content, but as something with **spatial structure, force-like drives, time evolution, interactive emergence, and critical balance**. This multifaceted formalization is a bold and original endeavor. The key to feasibility will be iteratively developing them with empirical grounding and keeping them connected to each other so that ultimately they form a coherent framework rather than isolated math exercises.\n\n## Resonance with Diverse Worldviews  \nFor the proposed framework to be truly integrative, it should **resonate with and contribute to diverse worldviews**. The question explicitly mentions Western academic, indigenous, spiritual, and systems thinkers as audiences or collaborators. Let’s consider each and how the work might speak to them, and also what each might contribute:\n\n- **Western Academic Worldview:** This includes mainstream scientists, psychologists, and philosophers. This audience values **rigor, clarity, and evidence**. The multi-method, formal approach is very much tailored to address their concerns: it aims to provide formal models (for clarity and rigor) and empirical validation (for evidence) of something often considered nebulous. By couching the discourse in terms of **cognitive science, developmental psychology, and mathematical modeling**, the project becomes legible to academics. For example, a cognitive scientist might appreciate that enactivism and affordance theory – established theories – are being advanced. A developmental psychologist might be drawn to the idea of measurable transformations in meaning-making (perhaps connecting to known stage theories or constructivist developmental assessments). A philosopher might be intrigued that phenomenology is being operationalized in new ways. However, the Western academic tradition can be skeptical of anything that smacks of “mysticism” or is not operationalized. The proposal’s inclusion of indigenous and spiritual perspectives might raise eyebrows among some traditional academics – but this is where the careful balance is key. By delivering solid formalisms and data, the project can **legitimize insights from other worldviews in academic terms**. In doing so, it could gently challenge Western academia to broaden its epistemology. If successful, it contributes a new **framework for mind and meaning** that could fit alongside other big theories (like predictive coding, 4E cognition, etc.), but with a unique relational and cross-cultural flavor. For academics, one of the most appealing contributions could be a **unified vocabulary or model** that connects first-person and third-person views – something much needed in fields like consciousness studies or psychosomatic medicine, etc.\n\n- **Indigenous Worldview:** As discussed, indigenous knowledge systems emphasize **relationality, holism, and the living cosmos**. Key concepts often include respecting all relations (human and non-human), cyclical time, and knowledge via stories and direct experience. The framework’s relational stance aligns deeply here. By acknowledging indigenous epistemologies, the project shows respect and willingness to learn from them. One way it resonates is by potentially providing a **bridge language**: Indigenous communities might say “everything is connected” and Western science asks “how, in detail?” – this research might offer models and metaphors to articulate some of those connections in a way Westerners can grasp, without diminishing the truth of the indigenous insight. For instance, the idea that meaning emerges in interaction and in place could scientifically underscore why indigenous rituals (which engage people with land, ancestors, etc. together) are so powerful in creating shared meaning. The project could contribute back by validating indigenous knowledge on its own terms: showing that Western methodologies can finally *see* the importance of relational context that indigenous peoples always knew. It can also be a platform for **co-creating knowledge**: involving indigenous scholars or elders might lead to new categories or variables that the Western models would have overlooked. For example, an indigenous perspective might introduce the idea of **ancestral presence** or **spiritual quality** as part of meaning perception – something Western models don’t usually consider. The integrative framework could, in principle, accommodate that (perhaps as an extended social/temporal dimension in participatory sense-making, where ancestors are participants in a sense). If the project fosters genuine dialogue, it can demonstrate how two knowledge systems can enrich each other – a form of epistemological reconciliation. One must be cautious, though, to avoid appropriation or reduction. Indigenous wisdom often comes embedded in story and practice; translating it into models must be done collaboratively to avoid losing the spirit of it. But if done right, the outcome might be a framework that indigenous thinkers feel represents their worldview more faithfully than typical Western psychology does, and Western thinkers find innovative because it breaks out of individualistic, objectified mode. A practical contribution could be in areas like environmental management or education: incorporating relational meaning could improve programs that engage indigenous communities by aligning with their values (for example, showing scientifically that management decisions made with ceremonial inclusion of the land’s “meaning” lead to more sustainable outcomes).\n\n- **Spiritual/Contemplative Worldviews:** Many spiritual traditions, Eastern and Western, place a high value on direct experience of meaning, often describing it in terms of unity, love, or deep insight. For example, mystics speak of experiences where the separation between self and other dissolves, resulting in a profound sense of meaning or bliss. Meditative traditions train perception to see reality as it is, which often includes perceiving the interdependence (Buddhism) or the divine quality (Vedanta) in everything. The project’s focus on **quality perception and developmental transformations** is very relevant here – many spiritual paths are essentially training to enhance perception (mindfulness increases one’s moment-to-moment perceptiveness) and to undergo **transformations of consciousness** (sometimes described as stages of awakening). The integrative framework can resonate with spiritual folks by confirming some of their experiential claims in a systematic way. For instance, advanced meditators often report phenomena like feeling a “field of consciousness” or the unity of subject-object. If the formal model (say, topological or metastable) can describe how at a certain stage of development the boundaries in the meaning-space dissipate (topologically perhaps a merger of previously separate regions), that mathematically echoes the spiritual description of non-duality. The idea of metastability might resonate with the balance sought in many practices (neither dull nor agitated mind, but poised at the edge of stillness and motion). Moreover, spiritual practices could serve as a testbed: practitioners cultivate first-person skills that the project could use to gather really refined phenomenological data. They also often engage in intersubjective spiritual practices (like Sufi whirling, Zen meditation retreats, or modern practices like Circling) that could be studied as high-level participatory sense-making of meaning beyond words. The contribution to spiritual worldviews would be an articulation of their insights in a secular, intersubjectively validated language. That can help bring spiritual wisdom into dialogue with science without reductionism. Also, it might provide new tools – for example, if the research identifies certain patterns that indicate a person is about to have a transformative insight, that might inform spiritual counseling or technology-assisted meditation (neurofeedback devices that cue a person when they’re in a state conducive to insight). There is already a growing field of **contemplative science** (supported by groups like Mind & Life Institute) that merges meditation and neuroscience; this project could feed into that, adding a focus on meaning and quality (not just on basic attention or stress reduction). Spiritual participants might appreciate that the work does not dismiss the **qualitative, ineffable** aspects as mere “noise” but actually puts quality at the center.\n\n- **Systems Thinkers and Metatheorists:** Systems thinkers (in the vein of Fritjof Capra, Peter Senge, Donella Meadows, Gregory Bateson, etc.) tend to think in terms of wholes, interconnections, and dynamic change. They often work on problems like organizational learning, sustainability, or social change. Such thinkers might see an immediate parallel: perceiving quality in a relational way is crucial for systems change. For instance, Senge’s work on learning organizations emphasizes **“building shared vision”** and **“seeing interrelationships”** – essentially improving collective meaning-making in companies. Bateson talked about the “pattern that connects” and warned of separating the analytic mind from the holistic understanding of life – he would likely applaud a project trying to formally map the *pattern of meaning*. The integrative framework can give systems thinkers something they love: a model that is at once scientific and **transdisciplinary**. It integrates human subjective factors (often a missing piece in systems models which can be overly quantitative) with rigorous thought. Systems thinkers also value **feedback loops and iterative learning** – which is mirrored in the project’s methodology of iterating between methods and perspectives. In fact, the whole approach is somewhat **second-order** (it looks at observers observing meaning, includes itself reflexively). This aligns with second-order cybernetics’ principle that we must include the observer in the system. The project could contribute to systems theory by offering a case study of integration, maybe even expanding systems modeling to incorporate *qualities* not just quantities. Classic system dynamics deals with measurable stocks and flows; adding human-perceived quality as a variable could open new avenues (e.g., in sustainability, how do we formally incorporate the *value* indigenous people place on a forest? The project’s frameworks might give hints). Metatheorists like those in the Integral community or the “metamodern” thinkers might find this work exciting because it exemplifies the kind of synthesis they call for – uniting science, spirituality, culture, etc., in a concrete research endeavor. The concept of developmental transformations of meaning is a common thread with adult developmental psychology (e.g., Kegan’s theory of evolving self, or Spiral Dynamics); the formal modeling could provide fresh insight to those theories (for example, seeing a stage transition as a bifurcation lends a new metaphor to discuss it). Systems thinkers often emphasize that solutions to global problems require a *change in consciousness or worldview* – essentially improved quality perception of our interconnectedness. This project addresses that foundation: if we can formalize and enhance how people perceive quality and meaning, it could underpin better decision-making in complex systems. \n\nIn summary, the project stands at a nexus of worldviews. **Communication and framing will be key** for resonance:\n- To academics: frame it as an innovative but rigorous extension of cognitive and systems science.\n- To indigenous partners: frame it as a respectful dialogue where science seeks to learn from age-old wisdom of relational living.\n- To spiritual communities: frame it as unfolding the science of what they explore internally, potentially validating the profundity of human experience.\n- To systems thinkers: frame it as building the capacity (in individuals and models) to see the whole, which is essential for wise action.\n\nIf executed well, the work could become a kind of **“Rosetta Stone”** translating between these communities. Each sees their core values reflected: academics see rigor, indigenous see respect for relational knowledge, spiritual see respect for inner transformation, and systems thinkers see holistic integration. This is a tall order, but even partially achieving it would be a significant contribution to breaking down silos of understanding. It also means the outputs should be accessible: perhaps producing different kinds of reports for different audiences (e.g. academic journal articles, but also community-friendly summaries or workshops with indigenous groups, etc.). The structured report asked for here is intended for both academic and public audiences, reflecting exactly this bridging intent. The final synthesis of the research likely will speak to universal themes – *connection, growth, understanding* – which are human universals regardless of worldview, thus providing common ground.\n\n## Potential Collaborators and Institutions  \nGiven the broad scope, the project would benefit from expertise and partnership across multiple fields. Here we identify some **leading thinkers, labs, and institutions** that could serve as valuable collaborators or advisors, aligning with the domains of phenomenology, cognitive science, indigenous scholarship, systems theory, etc.:\n\n- **Phenomenology and Enactive Cognitive Science:** Scholars like **Dr. Evan Thompson** (University of British Columbia) would be ideal – he is a philosopher who has worked extensively on bridging phenomenology, Buddhism, and cognitive science, including the enactive approach. **Dr. Hanne De Jaegher** (University of the Basque Country, Spain) is a key proponent of participatory sense-making【14†L31-L39】; her insight on social cognition and how meaning emerges in interaction would directly inform that aspect of the project. **Dr. Shaun Gallagher** (University of Memphis) is another prominent figure who works on embodied cognition and phenomenology, with interest in interpersonal aspects. The **Centre for Subjectivity Research** in Copenhagen (led by Dan Zahavi) could be a hub for collaboration on rigorous phenomenological method and theory – Zahavi’s work on intersubjectivity could guide how first-person and second-person data are interpreted. Additionally, **Dr. Francisco Varela’s legacy** is carried on by people like **Dr. Antoine Lutz** (now at INSERM, France) and **Dr. Claire Petitmengin** (France) who practice neurophenomenology and micro-phenomenology respectively; they could advise on integrating first-person data with third-person and on training participants for introspection. Institutions like the **Mind & Life Institute** (which fosters dialogue between science and contemplative traditions) can be both an intellectual resource and possibly a funder/connector for the contemplative aspects.\n\n- **Developmental Psychology and Education:** Since the project deals with developmental transformations, experts like **Dr. Richard Lerner** (Tufts University) or **Dr. Willis Overton** (Temple University) who champion the Relational-Developmental-Systems approach【10†L19-L27】 might be interested in the formal modeling of developmental change. In adult development, **Dr. Robert Kegan** (Harvard, now retired but influential) and **Dr. Susanne Cook-Greuter** could provide frameworks for meaning-making stages that the project could formalize. There’s also overlap with transformative learning: **Dr. Otto Scharmer** (MIT, Theory U) integrates phenomenological exercises into organizational change – he might offer practical avenues for applying quality perception enhancement in groups, as well as a network (the Presencing Institute) for pilot studies in organizations.\n\n- **Neuroscience and Complex Systems:** For metastability and brain dynamics, **Dr. J. Scott Kelso** (Florida Atlantic University) is the go-to person【18†L139-L148】; he pioneered the concept of metastable coordination in the brain and in social behavior, and might collaborate on testing whether those principles apply to meaning perception (maybe designing experiments to see metastable neural patterns during meaningful experiences). **Dr. Emmanuelle Tognoli** (Kelso’s collaborator) also focuses on coordination dynamics【18†L136-L144】 and could be involved. The **Santa Fe Institute** (SFI) is an institution specializing in complexity science; someone like **Dr. David Krakauer** (SFI’s president, a complex systems scientist) might take interest in the formal models bridging qualitative phenomena and complexity. SFI often encourages high-risk, high-interdisciplinarity ideas, so engaging with them could refine the project’s complexity aspect and provide a forum for critique from physicists and mathematicians. **Dr. Dynamical Systems in Psychology**: Researchers like **Dr. Paul van Geert** or **Dr. Esther Thelen’s legacy** (Indiana University has a tradition of dynamic systems in developmental psych) can advise on modeling development as dynamic process. **Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman** (though more in personality psych) has interest in self-actualization and might appreciate the integration of quality perception in psychology.\n\n- **Indigenous Scholars and Organizations:** A key collaborator might be **Dr. Shawn Wilson** (an Indigenous scholar known for “Research is Ceremony”), who explicitly writes about relational epistemology and could guide how to incorporate indigenous paradigms ethically【43†L21-L29】. **Dr. Gregory Cajete** (University of New Mexico) is an expert on indigenous education and knowledge (author of *Native Science*), offering insight into holistic science perspectives and perhaps suggesting analogues in indigenous knowledge for things like dynamic change (e.g., seasonal cycles as models). **Leroy Little Bear** (Blood Tribe, Canada) is another influential thinker who has described Blackfoot metaphysics in relational terms and engaged with quantum physics analogies – he might find the formal approach interesting and help ensure the language resonates with indigenous concepts. There are institutions such as the **Center for Indigenous Science** or programs in universities (e.g., University of Alaska’s cross-cultural studies, or University of Waikato in NZ has an indigenous psychology group) that could partner in research with local communities. It might also be wise to involve an **Indigenous elder or community leader** appropriate to wherever case studies are done, to contextualize and validate the approach culturally. On an institutional level, organizations like **UNESCO’s Local and Indigenous Knowledge Systems (LINKS)** program or the **First Nations Innovation Center** might be interested in the epistemological innovation aspect.\n\n- **Spiritual/Contemplative Experts:** This could involve figures like **Matthieu Ricard** (Buddhist monk with science background, often collaborating in studies of consciousness), or **Father Laurence Freeman** (Christian meditation teacher who engages in interfaith dialogue and science). They can provide participants or guidance for phenomenological aspects in advanced contemplatives. **Dr. B. Alan Wallace** (Santa Barbara Institute) is another Buddhist scholar bridging traditional teachings and scientific paradigms, possibly offering theoretical parallels (he has written about quality of awareness etc.). The **HeartMath Institute** (though somewhat controversial scientifically) specifically studies heart-rate variability and coherence in group settings related to quality of experience – they could supply data or collaboration on physiological measures of group meaning (they have looked at “collective heart coherence”). The **Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS)** might be interested since they fund studies on interconnectedness and transformations of consciousness outside the mainstream.\n\n- **Systems and Organizational Thinkers:** **Peter Senge** (MIT, Society for Organizational Learning) might be intrigued by how enhancing quality perception can improve organizational learning. **Dr. Nora Bateson** (International Bateson Institute) who works on “warm data” and transcontextual understanding might find synergy, since her emphasis is on the qualitative, relational information in systems (very akin to quality perception). **Dr. Fritjof Capra** (Center for Ecoliteracy) connects systems thinking with a sense of the sacred and meaning (as in his Tao of Physics and Web of Life); he might provide a historical perspective and help frame the narrative for wider acceptance. **Donella Meadows’ colleagues** in systems dynamics could help if the project tries to integrate these models into larger social simulations (like simulating how changes in collective meaning-making could impact, say, environmental action).\n\n- **AI and HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) Labs:** If technology for enhancing quality perception is a goal, labs like **MIT Media Lab**, specifically groups like **Fluid Interfaces** or **Affective Computing**, might collaborate. For instance, **Dr. Pattie Maes** (Fluid Interfaces) works on tech that augments human cognition – she might be interested in tools to augment introspection or intersubjective understanding. **Dr. Rosalind Picard** (Affective Computing) has done work on measuring emotion; expanding that to measuring “meaning” could be a new direction. Additionally, **AI ethics groups** (e.g., at DeepMind or OpenAI) might like the idea of formalizing human values and meaning to better align AI with human well-being, thus could be partners or end-users of the conceptual framework.\n\n- **Funding and Interdisciplinary Programs:** Though not a person or lab, it’s worth listing potential **funding sources** as collaborators of sort – they shape the research. The **John Templeton Foundation** (and Templeton World Charity) often funds projects at the boundary of science, philosophy, and spirituality – this proposal fits their mission of investigating fundamental aspects of reality (like consciousness, complexity, and also they fund cross-cultural philosophy). For developmental and cultural aspects, **Templeton’s Diverse Intellectual Traditions** or **Science of Purpose** initiatives might be relevant. The **Fetzer Institute** is aligned with fostering love, forgiveness, and understanding; they might support the spiritual-relational side of the research. Government research councils often have programs: e.g., in the EU, **Horizon Europe** might have a call on “transformations to sustainability” or “human centered AI” where this fits; the **European Research Council (ERC)** could fund a high-risk high-gain project via an Advanced or Synergy grant due to its fundamental nature. In the US, **National Science Foundation (NSF)** has programs like **Science of Learning** or **Cyber-Human Systems** or even **Documenting Endangered Knowledge** (for indigenous knowledge) that could tie in. **Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada** heavily supports projects involving indigenous research and knowledge integration, so a Canadian context project might tap into that. **The Rockefeller Foundation** or **Ford Foundation** might be interested if the project has implications for societal well-being or intercultural bridge-building. The mention of “epistemological innovation” and “intercultural dialogue” in the question suggests looking at foundations like **Volkswagen Foundation** (they have funded unconventional interdisciplinary projects in the humanities/sciences interface) or **The Gerda Henkel Foundation** (sometimes supports human sciences with novel approaches).\n\n- **Interdisciplinary Academic Programs:** Centers like the **Center for Consciousness Studies** (University of Arizona) or the **Center for Complex Systems** at various universities, or **Integral Studies programs** (like California Institute of Integral Studies, CIIS) could host aspects of this research or provide students to work on it. The **Harvard Center for the Study of World Religions** could be interested in the cross-cultural philosophy aspect. The **Metagovernance Project** or **Stoa community** (new wave meta-thinkers mixing systems, spirituality, governance) might not fund but could propagate the ideas and provide test environments (some of these communities hold sense-making sessions that could be studied).\n\nIn assembling collaborators, it would be wise to have a **core interdisciplinary team** with at least:\n- A phenomenologist/philosopher,\n- A cognitive scientist or psychologist,\n- A mathematician/complex systems modeler,\n- An anthropologist or indigenous studies expert,\n- Possibly a contemplative practitioner or spiritual studies scholar,\n- And someone who can bridge to application (education or technology design).\n\nThis team, plus a network of advisors from the above list, would greatly enhance the rigor and reach of the project. Collaboration with established labs also gives access to resources: e.g., a neuroscience lab can provide EEG equipment if needed, an HCI lab can help develop a prototype tool for enhancing quality perception (like a biofeedback or augmented reality device that nudges attention).\n\nTo highlight a few “leading thinkers” names as examples:\n- **Evan Thompson** – bridging mind, life, and culture.\n- **Hanne De Jaegher** – social cognition enactivist.\n- **J. Scott Kelso** – metastable brain dynamics.\n- **Shawn Wilson** – relational indigenous research.\n- **Nora Bateson** – transcontextual patterns (Batesonian complexity of meaning).\n- **Matthieu Ricard** – contemplative insight + science.\n- **Dan Zahavi** – phenomenology of self and intersubjectivity.\n- **Gregory Cajete** – indigenous science of quality (e.g., how a community knows a place is healthy).\n- **Ken Wilber or Susanne Cook-Greuter** – for developmental stages of meaning (though Wilber is not in academia, his integral theory synthesizes many domains relevant here).\n- **Patricia Churchland** might be an interesting skeptic to involve – a neurophilosopher who might question the need for phenomenology, thus keeping the project sharp in defending itself.\n- **Michel Bitbol** – a lesser-known but insightful philosopher who works on consciousness and has engaged with both phenomenology and quantum physics; he might add depth in understanding how to formalize first-person knowledge.\n- **Zachary Stein** – an educational philosopher focusing on developmental psychology and meta-theory, who might contribute to how this affects learning and societal evolution.\n\nEach of these thinkers or labs can help steer parts of the project, critique it constructively, and ensure it remains grounded in or at least conversant with the relevant literature. \n\n## Funding Sources (Optional)  \n*(While not the main focus, we briefly mention some relevant funding sources/programs that align with the project’s interdisciplinary and transformative nature.)*\n\n- **John Templeton Foundation:** Known for funding projects at the intersection of science, philosophy, and spirituality, Templeton could support investigations into fundamental aspects of consciousness, value, and personhood that this project embodies. For example, their programs in “Science of Purpose” or “Cultural Evolution” might find an integrative epistemology project appealing. Templeton grants often encourage engagement with theological or philosophical perspectives, which suits the inclusion of spiritual and indigenous worldviews【26†L167-L175】【26†L179-L187】.\n\n- **Templeton World Charity Foundation (TWCF):** A sibling of JTF focusing on innovations that promote human flourishing. They have funded work on subjective well-being, consciousness, and global perspectives, which aligns with enhancing quality perception and intercultural epistemology.\n\n- **Fetzer Institute:** Fetzer’s mission is to help build the spiritual foundation for a loving world. They support research and projects that connect inner life and outer action. A framework that formalizes how people perceive meaning and quality (especially one that validates spiritual insight and could foster empathy or connection) is squarely within their interest in the “sacred in everyday life.”\n\n- **National Science Foundation (NSF):** In the U.S., NSF’s **Cyber-Human Systems** or **Information and Intelligent Systems** divisions might fund computational modeling aspects, especially if pitched as advancing AI or human-computer interaction through better understanding of human sense-making. Alternatively, **Social and Economic Sciences** divisions could support the basic science of cognition and culture integration. NSF also has special interdisciplinary programs (such as the former “INSPIRE” track or current “Convergence Accelerators”) which could back a high-risk, high-reward transdisciplinary project.\n\n- **Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada:** They explicitly encourage projects involving indigenous research paradigms and cross-disciplinary work between humanities and sciences. A proposal could be made under themes like “Imagining Canada’s Future” (they often have themes of building inclusive societies and leveraging wisdom from indigenous knowledge). SSHRC’s Insight or Partnership grants could apply, the latter if partnering with communities or international collaborators.\n\n- **European\n## Final Synthesis: Integrative Pathways Forward  \nIn conclusion, the pursuit of a formal model of **relational meaning perception** is both daring and timely. It calls for a new synthesis of knowledge – one that **unites the first-person and third-person perspectives** on human experience, **integrates multiple scholarly traditions and cultural worldviews**, and **bridges qualitative depth with quantitative rigor**. The analysis above has highlighted the rich theoretical groundwork (phenomenology, enactivism, etc.), the multi-pronged methodology and its challenges, alternative viewpoints that bolster the vision, and potential collaborators across domains. \n\n**Promising Integrative Pathways** emerge from this exploration:\n\n- **Neuro-Phenomenological Integration:** One clear pathway is refining **methodologies that link subjective reports with objective patterns** – essentially a modern neurophenomenology expanded to “sociophenomenology.” By training participants in phenomenological self-observation and simultaneously recording interaction dynamics or physiological data, the project can create **datasets that contain both lived experience and third-person measures**. Analyzing these in tandem will allow the formal models (like dynamical equations or topological mappings) to be directly informed by real human experiences of meaning. This integrative practice ensures that the resulting formal model is **grounded in phenomenological reality**, not an abstract construct. It also contributes back to methods: demonstrating a way to do rigorous science *with* first-person data rather than in spite of it【18†L136-L144】【18†L139-L147】. This methodological template could influence many fields (e.g. clinical psychology, where patient experience and clinician observation need joint modeling).\n\n- **Transdisciplinary Theoretical Synthesis:** Another pathway is the **synthesis of concepts across traditions** to form a coherent theoretical language. For instance, the project can develop a conceptual framework where **Gibsonian affordances【32†L49-L57】 meet Alexander’s wholeness【33†L249-L258】, and where enactive autonomy meets indigenous relationality**. By identifying the common denominator – e.g., the idea that *meaning = a relation that has a certain quality (value) perceivable through engagement* – the team can create an integrative theory that any community can recognize a part of. This might involve coining new terms or models: perhaps a notion like **“meaning field”** (evoking attention field, affordance field, and indigenous “medicine field”) or **“quality matrix”**. Such integrative concepts, once backed by formal definition, can travel between conversations with a neuroscientist, a philosopher, or an elder and still make sense, albeit metaphorically in some contexts and mathematically in others. The key is that the model remains **flexible and multi-layered**: it might have a mathematical layer for scientists, a narrative layer for communities, and a visual diagram for educators – all mapping to the same underlying structure. This way, the model itself becomes a meeting ground for worldviews, demonstrating its own thesis that meaning is co-constructed. \n\n- **Formal Models Synchronized with Human Development:** The five formal approaches shouldn’t remain separate silos; a pathway forward is to **orchestrate them into a multi-scale model**. For example, imagine a comprehensive simulation or framework where: the **topological map** represents an individual’s meaning-space (which can grow or rewire over time), the **vector field** represents motivational forces at any given moment (how the individual moves in that space), the **dynamical system** rules govern the evolution of the state (with parameters that can change at developmental junctures), **participatory coupling** occurs when two or more individual models interact (linking their state-spaces and exchanges of “force” signals), and the entire system operates in a **metastable regime** that enables spontaneous new meaning to emerge without chaos. Building this kind of **integrated simulation** – even if simplified – would be a proof of concept that the core research question can be answered: such a model would *by design* account for first-person experience (encoded in the state and topology), third-person observation (the measurable interactions and trajectories), developmental change (topology morphing, new attractors forming), and it would generate patterns potentially correlating with enhanced quality perception. This is admittedly an idealized end-point, but steps toward it (like coupling two people’s simple meaning maps in a computer model to see if joint structures form that reflect known social phenomena) are concrete milestones. The very process of integration will likely reveal which formalisms are most essential and which can be absorbed into others. Perhaps the end result is a single unified formalism (for example, a **“relational meaning dynamical network”** model) that encapsulates all five aspects.\n\n- **Applied Practices and Technologies:** An integrative pathway also leads to **practical innovation**. With theoretical clarity and models in hand, the project can inform the design of **practices and tools to enhance quality perception** – effectively testing the model in real-world action. For instance, the research might inspire **workshop protocols** where participants are guided through stages of shared sense-making (based on participatory sense-making principles) while facilitators use insights from metastability to know when to introduce novelty or when to allow integration pauses. These workshops could be used in schools (to train relational awareness in students), in companies (to improve collective creativity and empathy), or in interfaith dialogues (to help people truly perceive the quality in each other’s worldviews). On the technology side, imagine a **biofeedback or AI-assisted system** that monitors some indicators of a user’s engagement and sense of meaning (perhaps subtle facial micro-expressions or speech patterns) and provides gentle cues to deepen reflection or connection – essentially a “Meaning Coach.” The development of such an application would both demonstrate the model’s utility and provide further data to refine it. Another example: **educational curricula** informed by this research might teach kids how to attend to the “field” of a situation (like some mindfulness programs do) and how to articulate what quality they perceive, bridging subjective and intersubjective from early on. By planting the research insights into practices, we create a feedback loop: the practices test the model’s predictions (do people report enhanced perception of meaning as expected?) and those outcomes feed back into theoretical refinement. This ensures the work doesn’t remain an academic exercise but contributes to human capacity in visible ways – answering the core question’s pragmatic aim.\n\n- **Cultural and Epistemological Bridge-Building:** A perhaps less tangible but profoundly important pathway is the **process of intercultural and inter-perspective collaboration itself**. By actively involving scientists, humanists, indigenous elders, contemplatives, and others in the research process, the project becomes a living example of the “participatory sense-making” it studies【17†L8463-L8471】【17†L8505-L8512】. The dialogues in team meetings, the mutual learning and occasional misunderstandings – all are opportunities to apply the framework in real time. In a sense, the *project’s team* can use the emerging model to **increase its own quality of collaboration**. For example, if the team recognizes metastable dynamics as valuable, they might intentionally balance periods of focused work with open-ended exploratory sessions, keeping the collaboration flexible yet coherent. If indigenous partners emphasize the importance of ritual for establishing a relational context, the team might incorporate simple rituals (like moments of gratitude or silence together) before analytical discussions – thereby directly experiencing how such practices impact collective meaning-making. By modeling this internally, the project answers its core question in an exemplary fashion: it **creates a microcosm where first-person and third-person, subjective intuition and objective analysis, modern science and ancient wisdom all participate in meaning-making together**. The “output” of such a process is not just papers or models, but a **community of practice** that embodies the integrated capacity for quality perception. Such a community can then seed larger change – members will carry the integrative mindset into their fields, teaching others by example. In this way, the project’s legacy could include an *epistemological shift* in how research is done and knowledge is valued across domains.\n\nFinally, addressing the **core research question**: *How can we formalize relational meaning perception to include first-person and third-person, track development, and enable enhancements of quality perception?* \n\nFrom our exploration, the answer likely lies in a **multilayered solution**:\n- Embrace a **both/and epistemology**: use phenomenology to tell us *what* quality perception is like, and formal modeling to tell us *how* it might be structured and change, holding both as equally essential【34†L43-L48】【39†L1-L4】.\n- Develop a **framework that is iterative and self-correcting**: start with smaller phenomena (say dyadic interactions) and formalize those, then build up to larger ones (personal development over years), ensuring consistency at each step.\n- Leverage **analogies and metaphors** from multiple disciplines in the formalism: e.g., treat a developing person like a self-organizing system (from complexity theory)【18†L139-L147】, treat a meaningful moment like a gestalt figure emerging from ground (from Gestalt psychology), treat a community’s shared story like a resonance phenomenon (from physics) – then translate these analogies into mathematical or computational models that can be tested.\n- Ensure the model has a place for **values**: possibly a formal representation of “value intensity” or “quality variable” that can rise or fall, so that “perception of quality” isn’t just implicit but an explicit part of the model’s state. In doing so, we formalize *value* (often considered unquantifiable) in a relational way – a pioneering step in bridging science and humanities. For instance, one could introduce a variable $Q$ in the dynamic equations which represents the sensed “quality” at time t, influenced by interactions and personal state, and see how maximizing $Q$ leads the system along certain trajectories (this parallels some ideas in reinforcement learning, but here $Q$ is subjective quality rather than external reward).\n\nBy following these pathways, the project can yield a formal model (or suite of integrated models) that answers the call: it will **account for first-person phenomenology (through structural features derived from it), account for third-person observation (through dynamical equations and validation of predicted behaviors), track development (through mechanisms like topology changes or bifurcations corresponding to transformations), and serve as a blueprint for practices/technologies (by highlighting leverage points – e.g., where a small change in interaction has big effects on quality perception, or how to maintain metastability for creativity).** In doing so, it contributes not just to academic knowledge but to the practical wisdom of how humans and societies can cultivate a deeper sense of meaning, connection, and **quality in life**.\n\nThe journey is undoubtedly complex, but as this analysis shows, the pieces to the puzzle are beginning to align. We stand to gain a new **integrative science of meaning** – one that is as rigorous as it is empathetic to lived reality, and as open to poetry as it is to equations. This integrative path, we conclude, is the most promising way forward to truly understand and enhance our human capacity for perceiving quality in our relationships and world. \n\n**Sources:** The content above builds on and cites numerous sources that inform each aspect of the discussion, from theoretical definitions to empirical findings.
