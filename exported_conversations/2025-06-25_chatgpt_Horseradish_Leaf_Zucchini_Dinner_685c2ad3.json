      "content": "That’s a bold and flavorful combo — especially with horseradish leaves, which are spicy and pungent, like a cross between mustard greens and arugula with a wasabi kick.\n\nHere are a few rustic and satisfying dinner ideas that highlight those ingredients:\n\n---\n\n### 🌿 1. **Horseradish Leaf & Zucchini Frittata**\n**Why:** Quick, one-pan, protein-rich, and balances the strong horseradish greens with mellow zucchini and eggs.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 zucchini (thinly sliced or grated)\n- 300g horseradish leaves (stemmed, chopped)\n- 4–6 eggs\n- 1 onion or garlic (if you have)\n- Olive oil or butter\n- Salt, pepper, optional cheese (feta or sharp cheddar)\n\n**Method:**\n1. Sauté onions/garlic (if using), then add zucchini, cook until softened.\n2. Add chopped horseradish leaves, stir until just wilted (1–2 min).\n3. Beat eggs, season, pour over veggies. Cook on low until mostly set.\n4. Optionally finish under broiler or flip and brown other side.\n\n---\n\n### 🍝 2. **Horseradish Leaf & Zucchini Pasta with Lemon and Chili**\n**Why:** Peppery greens pair beautifully with citrus, garlic, and olive oil in a quick pasta.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- Pasta of choice\n- 1 zucchini (ribboned or spiralized if possible)\n- 300g horseradish leaves (chopped)\n- Garlic, lemon zest/juice, chili flakes\n- Olive oil, salt, pepper\n\n**Method:**\n1. Cook pasta.\n2. Sauté garlic, zucchini, and horseradish leaves in olive oil until just tender.\n3. Toss with pasta, lemon juice/zest, chili flakes, salt, and pepper.\n4. Top with cheese, toasted seeds, or breadcrumbs if you like.\n\n---\n\n### 🥬 3. **Wilted Horseradish Greens & Zucchini Stir-Fry with Rice**\n**Why:** Fast, wholesome, lets you play with umami flavors (soy, sesame, miso).\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- Cooked rice\n- Zucchini (matchsticks or thin rounds)\n- Horseradish leaves\n- Soy sauce or tamari, sesame oil, garlic/ginger (optional), chili\n- Optional egg or tofu\n\n**Method:**\n1. Stir-fry zucchini in oil until golden.\n2. Add horseradish leaves and sauce elements — cook briefly.\n3. Serve over rice with a drizzle of sesame oil and chili crunch.\n\n---\n\n### 🥟 4. **Savory Zucchini & Horseradish Leaf Pancakes or Fritters**\n**Why:** Great if you want something snacky, crisp, and flexible.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 zucchini (grated and drained)\n- 300g horseradish leaves (chopped fine)\n- 1 egg\n- 2–3 tbsp flour (or chickpea flour)\n- Spices: cumin, salt, pepper\n\n**Method:**\n1. Mix all ingredients into a batter.\n2. Fry spoonfuls in oil until golden on both sides.\n3. Serve with yogurt, tahini, or a lemony dipping sauce.\n\n---\n\n### 🌿 Pro Tip on Horseradish Leaves:\nIf very mature and fibrous, blanch them first (boil 1–2 minutes, then ice water) to mellow the intensity and reduce chewiness.\n\nWant a recipe tailored to a specific diet (vegan, low-carb, etc.) or cuisine?",
