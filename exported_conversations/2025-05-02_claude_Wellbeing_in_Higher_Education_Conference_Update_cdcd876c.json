            "extracted_content": "Dear WHEN Network,\nI'm exploring a fundamental question about student well-being in higher education: What if our current challenges aren't just symptoms to be treated but outcomes of our institutional worldviews and structures? Rather than bringing in more well-being practices and efforts, we need to recognize and address the root causes. Increasingly, complex systems arise from cosmologies and schemas that open or close different affordances. That the results of our systems make sense, and rather than attempting to adapt a chaotic and complex system we don’t understand with interventions, we can/should work on foundational beliefs that allow the emergence of new pathways in a chaotic system from within stakeholders in that system. \nThe suggestion is to conduct a survey and through this survey, students, extended community members, faculty, and administrators had their worldview assumptions made clear. Then we can identify the consequences of those beliefs, and we open a bi-directional process that creates space for opening new worldviews (comprised of ontological, epistemological, and axiological elements). Making the subject an object, moving our worldview from something we see through into something we look at can help loosen the hold and serve as the foundation for reinforcing what works and develop new pathways in the complex system of education, society, the self, ecology, and wellbeing.\n“When will I use this?” - a question almost every teacher has heard. This makes me wonder if education is about usefulness… Is it an instrument? Or is it an end in and of itself? My hypothesis is that if it’s an end, it will likely promote well-being. If it’s an instrument, it is likely to be an impediment.\nThis is why “What is a university for” is a well-being challenge. Instrumentalizing learning transforms self- and world understanding. A better question might be, how will this experience transform me? This leads me to wonder what beliefs we have and how they show up in our policies in higher education that promote an instrumental view of education. \nBelow is a preliminary mapping that outlines how current policies and practices (and the assumptions behind them) may affect student well-being and ecological belonging. I’d love your input on whether these resonate with your institutions and what further questions or ideas come to mind.\nThis framework examines three interconnected dimensions: how we understand reality (ontological), how we view knowledge (epistemological), and what we value (axiological).\nBefore I share the tables, I’d like to open with some guiding questions:\nGUIDING QUESTIONS FOR WHEN NETWORK\n1. Mapping Assumptions & Institutional Worldviews\n(How do implicit assumptions shape learning, wellbeing, and institutional structures?)\nIdentifying Core Assumptions:\nWhat assumptions (ontological, epistemological, axiological) are most pervasive in your institution, and how do they shape student behavior and stress?\nHow do these structures manifest in your institution? Do these assumptions make sense? What assumptions might we be missing?\nBesides ontology, epistemology, and axiology, what other foundational worldview perspectives need to be examined?\nCosmology & Metaphysics in Education:\nHow do implicit cosmological and metaphysical assumptions in higher education shape student experiences of meaning, belonging, and well-being?\nHow can institutions recognize and deconstruct their dominant worldview to allow for a more pluralistic approach to learning?\n\n2. Differentiating Internal vs. External Stressors\n(How do external global challenges interact with internal institutional structures to affect student wellbeing?)\nInstitutional vs. Societal Pressures:\nHow might we distinguish well-being impacts from external factors (climate anxiety, economic uncertainty) versus internal institutional structures (grading systems, competitive frameworks)?\nHistorical & Structural Evolution of Universities:\nHow important is the historical evolution of universities to our understanding? \nHow can we position higher education to be responsive to people’s questions today?\n\n3. Alternative Models & Transformative Practices\n(How can different educational models and artistic perspectives contribute to wellbeing and expanded worldviews?)\nExploring Alternative Learning Models:\nWhat educational models integrate alternative ontologies and cosmologies? How do they impact student mental health?\nWhat existing research or pilot programs at your institutions might help us better understand these relationships?\nThe Role of the Arts & Creative Practices in Learning and Wellbeing:\nWhat’s the importance of the arts in self, world, and social system (university) understanding?\nWhat are the features of the artistic praxis that open doors to well-being and different mindsets?\n\n4. Research, Data, & Collaboration\n(What frameworks and methodologies can help us investigate these issues systematically?)\nData & Collaborative Inquiry:\nWhat existing data, surveys, or qualitative research could we share to better map these worldviews and their impacts on well-being?\nIs there interest in a joint research project to explore this further?\nONTOLOGICAL (Nature of Reality)\nStructure\nUnderlying Assumption\nPolicy Manifestation\nWellbeing Impact\nFixed Learning Environments\nLearning happens in controlled spaces/times\nRigid schedules, standard classrooms\nDisconnection from natural rhythms, reduced embodied learning\nIndividual Assessment Focus\nStudent as isolated unit (Individual achievement)\nAnti-collaboration policies, competitive grading\nSocial isolation, comparison anxiety\nKnowledge as a Commodity\nLearning is about acquiring information rather than transformation.\nEmphasis on standardized testing, memorization-based exams, and grade performance.\nDisconnection from intrinsic motivation; anxiety over performance rather than deep learning.\nLinear, Fragmented Curriculum\nKnowledge exists in separate disciplines rather than an interconnected whole.\nDepartments are siloed into rigid specializations with little interdisciplinary interaction.\nLimits systems thinking, and discourages holistic approaches to learning.\n\nEPISTEMOLOGICAL (Nature of Knowledge)\nStructure\nUnderlying Assumption\nPolicy Manifestation\nWellbeing Impact\nStandardized Assessment\nKnowledge is measurable/comparable\nHigh-stakes testing, rigid rubrics\nTest anxiety, reduced creativity\nLinear Prerequisites\nKnowledge is hierarchical\nCourse sequences, major requirements\nFear of \"falling behind,\" fixed mindset\nExpert-Centered Teaching\nKnowledge flows one way\nLecture formats, minimal dialogue\nReduced engagement, meaninglessness\n\n\nAXIOLOGICAL (Nature of Value)\nStructure\nUnderlying Assumption\nPolicy Manifestation\nWellbeing Impact\nQuantified Achievement\nWorth measured numerically\nGPA systems, rankings\nSelf-worth instability, performance anxiety\nCareer Preparation Focus\nEducation as job training\nROI metrics, employment tracking\nPurpose anxiety, delayed fulfillment\nCompetition Emphasis\nSuccess as comparative standing\nSelective admissions, curved grading\nPerpetual comparison, status stress\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL/METAPHYSICAL (What sort of Universe are we in?)\nStructure\nUnderlying Assumption\nPolicy Manifestation\nWellbeing Impact\nInstrumental View of Learning\nEducation is about productivity and economic utility, not personal or spiritual growth.\nFocus on career readiness, employability metrics, and job-placement statistics.\nAnxiety about the future, loss of meaning in education, existential uncertainty.\nEfficiency & Acceleration Culture\nProgress is about speeding up learning rather than deepening understanding.\nFast-tracked degree programs, productivity-focused academic policies.\nBurnout, time anxiety, inability to engage with slow and reflective learning.\nMind-Body Dualism\nLearning happens in the mind; the body is secondary or irrelevant.\nSedentary learning structures, lack of embodied education.\nPhysical tension, stress, reduced engagement due to lack of movement.\nAnthropocentric Model\nHumans are separate from the natural world; knowledge is about control and mastery rather than coexistence.\nNature is treated as an external subject rather than an integrated learning system.\nAlienation from ecological belonging, reduced environmental responsibility.\n\n\nGathering Prerequisite Research Reading\nI’m starting to gather proposed research reading and am very grateful for your insights and suggestions here:\n\"The University in Ruins\" (Readings, 1996) - Analysis of how market logic transformed university purpose\n\"The Beautiful Risk of Education\" (Biesta, 2013) - Examines education as an existential process\n\"Student Well-being in Higher Education: A Systematic Review\" (McIntyre et al., 2018)\n?\n\n\nI'm compiling a shared resource library and would welcome your contributions, whether data, case studies, or observations. If there's sufficient interest, we could form a working group to explore these questions more deeply.\n\nhttps://www.routledge.com/Beautiful-Risk-of-Education/Biesta/p/book/9781612050270\n\nSurvey Idea Zero:\nThis survey invites participants to reflect on embedded assumptions about reality, knowledge, and value in education. The data collection process is designed to surface hidden assumptions, foster dialogue, and open perspectives on learning.\n\nSECTION 1: ONTOLOGY (The Nature of Reality & The Learner)\n1. What does it mean to \"be educated\"?\n(What makes someone truly “learned” or “wise” in your view?)\n2. Do you feel that you are separate from or interconnected with what you are studying?\n☐ Completely separate (observer)\n☐ Somewhat separate (neutral, but I apply knowledge when needed)\n☐ Deeply connected (learning changes who I am and how I relate to the world)\n☐ Other: _______\n3. Universities assume that learning happens inside the mind. Have you ever learned something with your body, emotions, or intuition instead?\n(Describe an experience where this happened.)\n4. If knowledge was something we lived rather than possessed, how would universities change?\n(What would classrooms look like? What would tests look like?)\n\nSECTION 2: COSMOLOGY & METAPHYSICS (The Big Picture & Meaning-Making)\n5. In your education, where does knowledge come from?\n☐ Professors and textbooks\n☐ Experience and personal insight\n☐ Relationships with others\n☐ The natural world\n☐ Something greater/spiritual/sacred\n☐ Other: _______\n6. Universities are often seen as places of “light” and discovery. What kind of “darkness” (the unknown, mystery, uncertainty) does your education acknowledge?\n(Where does mystery fit in learning? What happens when we don’t know something?)\n7. Do you believe education should help people find meaning in life?\n☐ Yes, absolutely\n☐ Somewhat, but it’s not the university’s role\n☐ No, universities should focus on practical skills\n☐ I’m not sure\n8. If you were designing a university for a society 500 years in the future, what would be at its core?\n(What knowledge, ways of learning, or values would you include? What would you leave behind?)\n\nSECTION 3: EPISTEMOLOGY (The Nature of Knowledge & How We Know Things)\n9. When do you know something is true? (Select all that apply.)\n☐ When I read it in a credible source\n☐ When I experience it firsthand\n☐ When an authority figure confirms it\n☐ When it makes logical sense\n☐ When it aligns with intuition or gut feeling\n☐ When it is validated by a community or tradition\n☐ Other: _______\n10. Have you ever had a moment when something you “knew” was suddenly challenged or undone?\n(What happened? How did it feel?)\n11. If universities valued multiple ways of knowing equally (scientific, intuitive, indigenous, artistic, experiential), what would change?\n(How would that shift what counts as knowledge and who counts as knowledgeable?)\n\nSECTION 4: AXIOLOGY (What is Valuable & Worth Pursuing?)\n12. What makes learning valuable? (Choose the one closest to your view.)\n☐ Its usefulness in getting a job\n☐ The ability to think critically and adapt\n☐ The transformation of the learner\n☐ The contribution it makes to a community or society\n☐ The joy of curiosity and exploration\n13. What does success in education look like to you? (Write a sentence or two.)\n14. Imagine you could attend university without grades, degrees, or career pressure. Would you still go? Why or why not?\n15. If you could change one thing about how learning is valued in universities, what would it be?\n\n\nSurvey Idea One:\nSECTION 1: REFLECTING ON YOUR LEARNING JOURNEY\n1. What’s the most important thing you’ve learned in the past year?\n(It could be from a class, a conversation, a mistake, an experience, or something unexpected.)\n2. Why did you learn it? (Select all that apply.)\n☐ I needed it for a grade/class.\n☐ It was required for my future career.\n☐ I was genuinely curious.\n☐ It helped me navigate a challenge in life.\n☐ Someone I respect shared it with me.\n☐ It just happened, I wasn’t trying to learn.\n☐ Other (please describe): _______\n3. If you had to erase all of your formal education but could keep one lesson, what would remain?\n(This could be a skill, a mindset, a feeling, or something unexpected.)\n4. Can you describe a moment when time disappeared while you were learning?\n(What were you doing? How did it feel?)\n\nSECTION 2: CHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT LEARNING\n5. If universities stopped offering degrees tomorrow but kept teaching, would you still study? Why or why not?\n6. Imagine learning was something you couldn’t \"own\"—it only existed in relationships.\nHow would that change the way you approach education?\nWould you learn differently?\n7. Have you ever reached a goal, only to realize what mattered most was the process?\n(Describe what happened.)\n8. If learning were a dance instead of a destination, what would it feel like?\n(Use a metaphor, an image, or a short description.)\n\nSECTION 3: HOW DO YOU SEE LEARNING?\n9. I see learning as… (Check all that apply.)\n☐ A path to a job\n☐ A way to expand who I am\n☐ A responsibility to my community\n☐ Something sacred\n☐ A tool to get ahead\n☐ A process I do with others\n☐ A way to experience the world\n☐ Other (please describe): _______\n10. What’s one assumption about learning you’ve never questioned before today?\n11. If you could change one thing about how learning happens in universities, what would it be?\n(Be as creative or radical as you like!)\n\nSurvey Idea Two:\nSurvey as research and transformation process:\n\"Transformative Dimensions of Adult Learning\" (Mezirow, 1991)\n\"The Tipping Point in Transformative Learning\" (Taylor, 2008)\n\"Sudden and Gradual Approaches to Enlightenment\" (Gregory, 1987)\nResearch suggests both gradual and sudden transformation are valid paths. Mezirow's Transformative Learning Theory identifies both incremental shifts and sudden perspective transformations. The Buddhist tradition speaks of both gradual and sudden enlightenment \nWe propose a three-phase relational inquiry that might itself catalyze transformation:\nDeep Listening Circles (8-10 participants) These circles mix students, faculty, and administrators in guided dialogue around seemingly simple questions that often reveal deeper assumptions:\n\"What was the last thing you learned that surprised you?\"\n\"When does time feel different in your learning?\"\n\"What do you do with knowledge once you have it?\"\n\"If education were a gift, how would you receive it?\"\nThe power lies in how these questions often lead participants to notice their instrumental relationships with learning.\nEmbodied Campus Explorations Small groups walk their campus together, noticing:\nWhere learning feels alive vs mechanical\nSpaces that invite presence vs rushing\nPlaces that foster connection vs transaction\nThis physical exploration often reveals how institutional assumptions are built into our environment.\nCollective Meaning-Making Groups reconvene to:\nShare stories and patterns\nCreate visual maps of insights\nIdentify transformational moments\nDocument emerging questions\nSurvey Idea Three:\n1. Questions That Reveal Teleological Assumptions Indirectly\nLearning as Transaction vs. Learning as Life\n“If learning were never graded, never evaluated, and never led to a career, would you still pursue it? What would that look like?”\n“When was a time you learned something deeply, but it didn’t ‘count’ in any formal way?”\n“How do you know when you’ve truly learned something? When do you feel it in your bones?”\n→ (These questions gently tease apart whether learning is framed as instrumental or intrinsic without demanding an upfront declaration.)\nPlaying with Time & Progress\n“Does knowledge feel like something you accumulate over time, or does it feel like something that arrives all at once?”\n“What is something you’ve tried to master through effort, but later realized you understood only when you stopped trying?”\n“If you could learn anything but you could never tell anyone you learned it, what would it be?”\n→ (These questions begin to trouble linear and utilitarian views of learning, creating cognitive dissonance that invites reflection.)\nEncountering the Paradox of Mastery\n“Can you describe a moment where you thought you understood something, only to realize later you didn’t?”\n“Is there something you know deeply but cannot explain?”\n“If you had to teach something without using words, how would you do it?”\n\n"

I've been deeply exploring the intersection of wellbeing in higher education since our last exchange, and I'd like to share both my progress and a refined approach before our July conference.\n\n**New perspective: From interventions to transformative dialogue**\n\nI've been developing a framework examining how institutional worldviews shape student wellbeing, but recent work has led me to see this as more than just mapping assumptions - it's about creating spaces for transformative dialogue where multiple perspectives can reveal hidden dimensions of our educational structures.\n\nRather than simply treating symptoms with wellness programs, I'm exploring how we might create \"parliament-like\" spaces where diverse viewpoints can interact - not to reach consensus, but to illuminate tensions and generate new insights about the relationship between education and wellbeing.\n\n**Progress so far:**\n- Developed a triadic framework examining ontological, epistemological, and axiological assumptions in education\n- Created prototype survey approaches that function as both research tools and transformative experiences\n- Started mapping how competing perspectives might generate productive tension rather than merely creating stress\n- Explored how \"attentional policies\" (what we notice and value) shape educational environments\n\n**Proposed next steps before July:**\n1. **Pilot a multi-perspective dialogue:** Facilitate small groups (8-10 participants) with students, faculty, and administrators functioning as different \"agents\" with distinct perspectives on wellbeing. This approach treats diverse viewpoints not as obstacles to overcome but as necessary elements of a richer understanding.\n\n2. **Develop a \"beauty engine\" for educational contexts:** Create a framework for identifying moments of resonance and meaning in educational spaces - instances where participants recognize something true beyond mere data points.

This document outlines the features, functionality, and implementation phases needed to turn the conceptual framework we discussed into a practical research tool.\n\nThe PRD addresses several key aspects:\n\n1. **Multi-Agent Framework** - Defining different educational perspectives (like The Pragmatist, The Humanist, etc.) with specific attention patterns\n\n2. **Dialogue Interface** - Structured conversation tools that balance participation and capture insights\n\n3. **Knowledge Capture System** - Methods for identifying moments of resonance and organizing insights into your ontological/epistemological/axiological framework\n\n4. **Transformation Tracking** - Tools to measure how participants' perspectives shift through dialogue\n\n5. **Research Outputs** - Structured knowledge exports that maintain complexity while providing actionable insights\n\nThe implementation is phased to give you a viable MVP for your July conference (6 weeks) while setting the foundation for more sophisticated functionality later.\n\nFor your upcoming email to Jennifer, you might want to focus on the MVP version that could be implemented before the conference:\n\n---\n\nFor the conference, we could test a simplified version where:\n\n1. We create 4-5 defined \"perspective roles\" representing different educational worldviews\n2. Run facilitated dialogue sessions with mixed groups of students, faculty and administrators\n3. Use a basic digital form to track moments of resonance and tension\n4. Map insights to our ontological/epistemological/axiological framework\n5. Generate structured knowledge outputs that could inform wellbeing initiatives\n\nThis would give us valuable pilot data while testing the Parliament approach as both a research methodology and potential intervention.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to modify any aspects of the PRD to better align with your specific research interests or constraints?",

              "content": "# Parliament Protocol Research Platform\n## Product Requirements Document\n\n**Project Name:** Parliament Protocol for Wellbeing in Higher Education Research  \n**Author:** Bilal Ghalib  \n**Date:** May 2025  \n**Version:** 1.0\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe Parliament Protocol Research Platform enables structured multi-perspective dialogues around wellbeing in higher education. By creating a space where diverse viewpoints interact, the platform surfaces hidden assumptions, generates new insights, and potentially transforms participants' understanding of education and wellbeing. This platform serves as both a research methodology and a potential intervention.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrent approaches to wellbeing in higher education often:\n- Treat symptoms rather than addressing root causes\n- Fail to examine the underlying worldviews shaping institutional structures\n- Miss connections between ontological/epistemological/axiological assumptions and student experience\n- Rely on single-perspective research methodologies that may not capture the full complexity\n\nThe Parliament Protocol addresses these limitations by facilitating structured dialogues between multiple perspectives, tracking transformative insights, and producing structured knowledge outputs that honor complexity.\n\n## User Personas\n\n1. **Research Facilitator**\n   - Education researchers and faculty studying wellbeing\n   - Needs tools to design, run, and analyze multi-perspective dialogues\n   - Primary administrator of the platform\n\n2. **Dialogue Participants**\n   - Students, faculty, administrators, staff\n   - Engage in structured conversations about education and wellbeing\n   - May take on specific perspective roles or represent their authentic viewpoints\n\n3. **Institutional Decision Makers**\n   - Deans, department chairs, wellness program directors\n   - Use insights from Parliament sessions to inform policy and program design\n   - Need clear, actionable knowledge without losing complexity\n\n## Core Features\n\n### 1.

This document outlines the features, functionality, and implementation phases needed to turn the conceptual framework we discussed into a practical research tool.\n\nThe PRD addresses several key aspects:\n\n1. **Multi-Agent Framework** - Defining different educational perspectives (like The Pragmatist, The Humanist, etc.) with specific attention patterns\n\n2. **Dialogue Interface** - Structured conversation tools that balance participation and capture insights\n\n3. **Knowledge Capture System** - Methods for identifying moments of resonance and organizing insights into your ontological/epistemological/axiological framework\n\n4. **Transformation Tracking** - Tools to measure how participants' perspectives shift through dialogue\n\n5. **Research Outputs** - Structured knowledge exports that maintain complexity while providing actionable insights\n\nThe implementation is phased to give you a viable MVP for your July conference (6 weeks) while setting the foundation for more sophisticated functionality later.\n\nFor your upcoming email to Jennifer, you might want to focus on the MVP version that could be implemented before the conference:\n\n---\n\nFor the conference, we could test a simplified version where:\n\n1. We create 4-5 defined \"perspective roles\" representing different educational worldviews\n2. Run facilitated dialogue sessions with mixed groups of students, faculty and administrators\n3. Use a basic digital form to track moments of resonance and tension\n4. Map insights to our ontological/epistemological/axiological framework\n5. Generate structured knowledge outputs that could inform wellbeing initiatives\n\nThis would give us valuable pilot data while testing the Parliament approach as both a research methodology and potential intervention.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to modify any aspects of the PRD to better align with your specific research interests or constraints?",
