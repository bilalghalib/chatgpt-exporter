Peak freshness: 2-4 weeks after roasting\n   - This is when you'll get the best flavor and aroma\n\n2. Good but declining quality: 1-3 months\n   - Still quite drinkable but with gradually diminishing flavor complexity\n   - You may notice less crema in espresso drinks\n   - French climate tends to be moderate, which helps\n\n3. Starting to stale: 3-6 months\n   - Noticeably less aromatic\n   - Flavor becomes flatter and more one-dimensional\n\nFactors that affect storage life in France:\n- Summer humidity can accelerate staling, especially in coastal areas\n- Temperature fluctuations in non-climate-controlled spaces\n- How airtight your jar seal is\n- Whether beans are in direct sunlight through windows\n\nTips for longer storage:\n1. Use a jar with a rubber gasket seal\n2. Store away from heat sources (stove, oven, sunny windows)\n3. Consider freezing portions you won't use within a month\n4. Buy smaller quantities more frequently from local roasters\n\nWould you like me to explain more about any of these aspects or share specific storage recommendations for your region of France?",

Gentle methods to clear congestion:\n- Saline drops in the nose followed by nasal aspiration/bulb syringe\n- Run a cool-mist humidifier in their room while sleeping\n- Sit with baby in a steamy bathroom for 10-15 minutes\n- Gentle chest pats/percussion (ask your doctor for proper technique)\n\n2. Positioning:\n- Keep baby's head slightly elevated during sleep (for babies over 6 months)\n- Hold baby upright against your chest periodically\n- For nursing/feeding, try a more upright position\n\n3. Hydration:\n- Offer frequent breast milk/formula feeds\n- If old enough for water (6+ months), offer small amounts\n\nImportant safety notes:\n- Never give over-the-counter cough/cold medicines to babies\n- Honey should not be given to babies under 12 months due to botulism risk\n\nContact a doctor immediately if your baby:\n- Has difficulty breathing\n- Shows signs of respiratory distress (rapid breathing, wheezing)\n- Has a fever\n- Is under 3 months old\n- Seems lethargic or refuses to feed\n- Has symptoms that worsen or don't improve\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these methods in more detail?

In a large bowl, mix sourdough starter with whole wheat flour. Let rest 15-30 minutes to allow flour to hydrate.\n\n2. Whisk in egg, pumpkin puree, and melted butter until smooth.\n\n3. Add spices, salt, and vanilla. Mix well.\n\n4. Just before cooking, stir in baking soda. Add milk if batter seems too thick - it should be pourable but not runny.\n\n5. Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small pat of butter to grease.\n\n6. Pour about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on surface (2-3 minutes).\n\n7. Flip and cook other side until golden (1-2 minutes).\n```\n\nTips:\n- Let batter rest 15-30 minutes before cooking for better texture\n- Keep pancakes warm in oven at 200°F while cooking remaining batches\n- These freeze well for future breakfasts\n\nWould you like me to adjust any part of the recipe based on your preferences or the consistency of your starter?",
