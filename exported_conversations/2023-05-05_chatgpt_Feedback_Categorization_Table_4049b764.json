And we wouldn’t have made it this far without the help of many many people, so a BIG THANK YOU goes to:\n- my parents, sister Romy, and friends: you have always been my biggest support system:heart:\n- the startupscouts team Munir Bilal Tudor Tarlev Dana Dara for running the program, believing in us, fueling us with knowledge and zest, and giving us the opportunity to become part of a great community of entrepreneurs, mentors (thank you Anthony!), experts and other like minded people. This is not enough to mention everything you’ve offered, taught, and helped us with during the whole program. It’s unbelievable how much one can achieve in only a couple of months!\n- my fellow sprint and accelerator mates: even though it was a competition it never felt like it because we were all supporting each other, and offering valuable help and feedback. A big shout out especially to Wael and Rida :star-struck:\n- Fulbright MENA Alumni: inviting me to participate in the alumni panel last march at the reentry workshop gave me the chance to meet my dear friend and co-founder Cosette!\n- all the people who participated in our cocreation workshop, filled our survey, or simply offered us in person feedback or advice\n- our beta users!\n- all the organizers, partners and funders of the program AltCity, Summer of Innovation, Alfa Telecommunications: launching this virtual accelerator empowers people like me with a full-time job, or students, or anyone else to chase after their ideas and work on them. It more importantly allows young lebanese entrepreneurs to participate no matter where they are in Lebanon or the world, have a chance to contribute to the country, and maybe even come back to it. I am proud to say that Saffeh was driven by a remote team with cosette and Christelle being abroad!\nExcited for what lies ahead!

After taking calls and filling out this form we can ask the PM (in our case Dara) to fill out a form like this to digest insights into something she can share with Bloom and the Program Manager team so she can identify her Action Plan to improve the program month on month. https://airtable.com/shrHQuZNgnYJXfzCP\nI’d love it if you had time to digest your lessons Dara in the form above.

I was thinking it would be good to self rank where the Program Stands on the following: Mentorship\nEngagement and accountability\nPractical activities\nAnd inspiration\nI feel like perhaps I’m missing one.\nThe idea is if we reflect on how we’re doing on the following dimensions, do a 1% better style reflection exercise and create goals and action plans the Program will improve Month on Month AND OAK will improve at the same time as we’ll get insights from all Program Managers.\nI’d love your thoughts on this process for #1_0_programs-feedback thanks guys! :)AirtableAirtable\nTeam calls Round 2 - Airtable\nExplore the \"Team calls Round 2\" view on Airtable.

It gave us a better insight on how to reflect a better image of our work. This came handy once we started our large initiative to “reinvent the organization”, an initiative to update our policies, mission statement, and processes, and to make sure they are aligned with our activities.\nThe result was amazing, thanks for the team at Pitchworthy, especially Carol, who dedicated her time to help us analyze our strengths and weaknesses, and enhance our work accordingly. You can find attached our new organization profile, as a sample document resulting from this initiative.\nMohammad Al-Omari\nProject Director\nJORDAN Youth Innovation Forum\n7th Circle, Opposite Royal Jordanian and the Arab Bank,\nAyman Al Malkh Building, Office 306 (3rd floor)\nJordan Youth Innovation Forum\nAmman, Jordan (edited) \n:heart:\n2\n:tada:\n2\n:pushpin:\n1\n:yellow_heart:\n1Sara Daniel\n  4:41 PM\nBravo! :tada: Nice work!\nBilal Ghalib\n  7:44 AM\nThis should go on the website!\n2 replies\nLast reply 2 years agoView thread\nRichard Sanyour\n  9:45 AM\njoined #1_0_programs-feedback.
