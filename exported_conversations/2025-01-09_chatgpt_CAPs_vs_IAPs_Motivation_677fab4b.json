      "content": "what frameworks of human motivations might align with the CAPs vs IAPs described here:\nIntroduction\nIn his 1938 paper introducing revealed preference, Samuel-\nson1 warned:\nI should like to state my personal opinion that\nnothing said here… touches upon at any point the\nproblem of welfare economics, except in the sense\nof revealing the confusion in the traditional theory\nof these distinct subjects.\nSimilar sentiments followed, in Arrow,2 Sen,3 Anderson,4\netc. As an information basis for welfare, optimality, social\nchoice, etc, revealed preference has been much critiqued.\nAll the same, it’s hard to see how to move away from it, with-\nout paternalism: if people know best for their own lives—\nshouldn’t we trust their choices as the final proof of their\nintentions? How else can we avoid imposing “better values”\nfrom above?\nOne way to respond is to say that people do know best, and\nhave wise values, but that their revealed preferences aren’t\nthe last word on those values. But to establish this, you’d\nwant another source of information on people’s values—one\nthat retains much of the resolution, robustness, universal\napplicability, and democratic simplicity of preference.\nI’ll develop such an information source here, by taking two\n‘steps back’ from revealed preference, widening the infor-\nmation collected. Then I’ll argue that my new source cor-\nresponds with one definition of “values” used in common\nspeech. Finally, I’ll show how this new source can be used\nin social choice and welfare calculations.\nPreferences\nA rich literature covers how revealed preferences—which,\nwhen summed up, are called engagement metrics—lead us\nastray. You can often get people to choose something with-\nout serving their real interests: you can misinform them, or\nleverage their misplaced hopes.\nOr, you can make it so people need your thing for what\nonce was possible without it: they need your car to get to\nwork, your social media account to find a job, your dress to\nsocialize with their friends, etc.\nMore broadly, you can manufacture social circumstances\nwhere people choose your thing to “keep up with the Jone-\nses,” to signal allegiance with their tribe, or because they’ve\nlost the ability to coordinate a real solution.5\nIn some cases, the person will know their choice doesn’t ex-\npress their true interests—that they are bucking to external\npressure, caught in the system, or setting aside their goals\nto conform to a social rule.6 In other cases, options have\nbeen limited or biased behind our backs.\nGiven these problems, why does revealed preference still\nplay a role in notions of benefit and measures of optimality?\nIt has huge advantages as an information source: in the\nresolution and robustness of the data provided, its near-\nuniversal applicability, and the democratic simplicity of its\ncollection:\n• Preferences say fine-grained things how about each of\nus wants to live, informed by our local situations and\npriorities.\n• Preferences get at what we choose in the final analysis,\nour real, battle-tested priorities, not just what we say\nwe want.\n∗Thanks to B. Gabbai, A. Morris, A. Ovadya, J. Stray, & F. Noriega\n†School for Social Design joe.edelman@gmail.com\n1“A Note on the Pure Theory of Consumer's Behaviour.”\n2Social Choice and Individual Values.\n3“Rational Fools.”\n4“Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philosophy.”\n5See discussions of the prisoner’s dilemma in e.g., Sen, “Behaviour\nand the Concept of Preference”; Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya\nSen’s Philosophy.”\n6See Sen, “Rational Fools”; Anderson, Value in Ethics and Eco-\nnomics on ‘commitment.’\n1\n• Preferences work in many domains of life, and represent\nall-things-considered judgements, combining morality,\nprudence, whims, etc.\n• Finally, those who aren’t introspective or eloquent can\nstill express a preference. And preferences leave simple-\nto-understand, verifiable trails: purchase histories, vot-\ning records, etc.\nAttentional Policies\nI’ll try to address the problems with preference, holding on\nto these benefits. To do so, I want to take two ‘steps back.’\nThe first step is to widen the conception of choice to include\noption set formation.\nA revealed preference takes the options as given. As other\nauthors have pointed out,7 this doesn’t fully reflect how\nchoice works.\nConsider my choice, with colleagues, to say something witty.\nAt 𝑡1, I choose to say that in particular (over staying silent,\nor saying my second-place quip). But, at some earlier point\n𝑡0, I decided to invest my attention in finding witty things\nto say. I’ve tried witty phrases on in my mind, and tested\nsituations for witty reframings.\nAt 𝑡0, I made a much bigger choice–I adopted8 an atten-\ntional policy of ‘looking for witty quips and reframes.’ This\nis how I assembled the option set for my choice at 𝑡1.\nI think this earlier choice, at 𝑡0, reveals more about me than\nthe latter one. Indeed, these attentional policies (APs)\nmight account for much of what’s called my “personality”:\nWhen making friends, am I cautious or bold? When consid-\nering a purchase, is my focus on price, quality, or durabil-\nity? When speaking, do I try to be witty, precise, or down\nto earth? These may not just be “character traits” I was\nborn with, but policies I adopted, which work together for\nmy way of life.9\nCollecting an agent’s APs is part of my proposal to im-\nprove the information basis of welfare, social choice, and\nrecommenders. How could that work? You could use an\ninteractive survey to collect the agent’s common contexts\n(socializing, at work, in diﬀicult conversations), and have\nthem pick what they attend to most in each.10\nIf they claim to have AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐, you could verify that\nwith followup questions: First, you could ask them about\nrecent moments in 𝑐, and what options they’ve found using\n𝑎. Someone with a policy of vulnerability should be able\nto cough up various opportunities for vulnerability, recently\nconsidered; some taken, some not.\n7Smaldino and Richerson, “The Origins of Options.”\n8I adopt APs (just like I make plans, adopt heuristics, comply\nwith norms, follow through with intentions) because my bounded ra-\ntionality and social needs make it expedient. (Bratman, Intention,\nPlans, and Practical Reason; Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Ratio-\nnal Choice”; Taylor, The Language Animal)\n9This characterization of an identity as composed of APs shares\nsomething with Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philoso-\nphy”; and Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n10Social attestations, also, could be a source of AP information:\nsomeone who is widely admired for their wit likely has an AP about\nit. Behavioral data may also work: if someone shops by price or by\nquality, that may show up in purchase or click data. (Using, perhaps,\napproaches like Chang, Making Comparisons Count; or Levi, Hard\nChoices)\nAdditionally, that person will also know when exactly vul-\nnerability is called for, and when something else takes the\nfore. I don’t try to be vulnerable when giving directions to\na stranger, or with my dad. Generally, someone with 𝑎 in\n𝑐 will have detailed information about the shape of 𝑐.\nFigure 1: Verifying APs\nSupposing we collected an agent’s APs. How would that\ncompare with revealed preference data, in terms of resolu-\ntion, robustness, universality, and democratic simplicity?\nLike preferences, APs are informed by our local situations\nand priorities, and say fine-grained things about how we\nwant to live. Indeed, they have a higher resolution than\nI’ve let on so far: an AP about ‘honesty’ or ‘vulnerability’\nis always short for a more specific policy, like “attend to\nwhat I feel about each thing we discuss, and let my feeling\nshow,” or “attend to false impressions a listener may get\nfrom my statements, and head them off with a disclaimer.”\nThat is: having honesty as a policy requires a substantive\ninterpretation of honesty, and these differ from person to\nperson.\nAPs are battle-tested. I wish I could craft my words to\nsimultaneously be kind, honest, tactful, humble, and inspir-\ning. I wish I could, at the same moment, be precise in\nmy speech, aware how each word lands, aware of my own\nfeelings; transparent, calm, and centered; passionate; physi-\ncally graceful, like a dancer. But APs compete for my atten-\ntion. So, my choice to look for witty things to say crowds\nout many other options.\nLike preferences, APs are applicable across all domains in\nlife—the moral, the self-interested, etc, and apply to many\nkinds of contexts.\nBut, they score worse on democratic simplicity than re-\nvealed preference. And, for now, it’s unclear how an agent’s\nAPs would provide a substitute for revealed preference. I’ll\nget to that.\nConstitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2\n(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP.",

      "content": "The distinction between **Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)** and **Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs)** in your provided text offers a nuanced way to understand human motivations beyond traditional revealed preferences. To align these concepts with established human motivation frameworks, let's first briefly summarize CAPs and IAPs, then explore how various motivation theories correspond to these categories.\n\n### **Understanding CAPs vs. IAPs**\n\n- **Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs):** These are attentional strategies adopted based on a cost-benefit analysis aimed at achieving specific outcomes. IAPs are functional and often temporary, focusing on efficiency and goal attainment. For example, adopting a policy to focus on price when shopping to save money.\n\n- **Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs):** These policies arise from deeper, often intrinsic values or identity-based judgments. CAPs are integrated into one's sense of self and worldview, guiding behavior in a more holistic and enduring manner. For example, valuing honesty as a core personal trait, influencing interactions across various contexts.\n\n### **Alignment with Human Motivation Frameworks**\n\nSeveral established human motivation frameworks can be mapped onto CAPs and IAPs. Here's how some of the prominent theories align:\n\n#### **1. Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**\nDeveloped by Deci and Ryan, SDT emphasizes intrinsic and extrinsic motivations based on the fulfillment of basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness.\n\n- **Intrinsic Motivation (SDT):** Aligns closely with **CAPs**. When individuals engage in activities out of inherent interest or personal value (e.g., pursuing a hobby for joy), it reflects constitutive policies rooted in their identity and values.\n\n- **Extrinsic Motivation (SDT):** Corresponds to **IAPs**. Engaging in activities to obtain external rewards or avoid punishments involves instrumental policies aimed at specific outcomes.\n\n#### **2. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs**\nMaslow’s pyramid categorizes human needs from basic physiological necessities to self-actualization.\n\n- **Basic and Safety Needs:** Can be seen as **IAPs**, where actions are driven by the necessity to survive or feel secure (e.g., working to earn money for shelter).\n\n- **Belongingness, Esteem, and Self-Actualization:** These higher-level needs resonate with **CAPs**, as fulfilling these needs often involves pursuing activities aligned with personal growth, relationships, and intrinsic values.\n\n#### **3. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation**\nA simpler dichotomy often discussed in motivational psychology.\n\n- **Intrinsic Motivation:** Mirrors **CAPs** through actions driven by internal satisfaction and personal significance.\n\n- **Extrinsic Motivation:** Reflects **IAPs** with behavior aimed at external rewards or specific objectives.\n\n#### **4. Approach-Avoidance Motivation**\nThis framework describes motivations based on the desire to move toward (approach) or away from (avoidance) certain stimuli.\n\n- **Approach Motivation:** Can be associated with **CAPs** when driven by positive values or goals intrinsic to the individual’s identity.\n\n- **Avoidance Motivation:** Often aligns with **IAPs** when actions are taken to prevent negative outcomes or escape undesired states.\n\n#### **5. Goal-Setting Theory**\nFocuses on the establishment of specific and challenging goals to enhance performance.\n\n- **Specific, Challenging Goals:** Typically relate to **IAPs** as they involve strategic planning and effort to achieve defined outcomes.\n\n- **Personal Meaning in Goals:** When goals are deeply connected to one’s values or identity, they align with **CAPs**.\n\n#### **6. Values-Based Theories (e.g., Schwartz’s Theory of Basic Human Values)**\nThese theories categorize values that guide behavior across different cultures and contexts.\n\n- **Terminal and Instrumental Values:** Terminal values (end-goals like happiness, self-respect) align with **CAPs**, reflecting constitutive beliefs. Instrumental values (modes of behavior like honesty, ambition) can correspond to **IAPs** when used strategically to achieve broader goals.\n\n### **Integrating CAPs and IAPs into Frameworks**\n\nUnderstanding CAPs and IAPs enriches these frameworks by providing a lens to differentiate between motivations rooted in identity and intrinsic values versus those based on strategic, outcome-oriented decisions. Here's how integration might look:\n\n- **SDT Integration:** Recognize that fulfilling autonomy, competence, and relatedness can foster CAPs, while controlled motivations might lead to IAPs.\n\n- **Maslow’s Hierarchy:** Consider higher-level needs as fostering CAPs, encouraging behaviors that reflect personal growth and self-actualization, whereas lower-level needs drive IAPs focused on survival and security.\n\n- **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic:** Use CAPs to explore deeper intrinsic motivations and IAPs to understand extrinsic drivers, offering a more comprehensive view of why individuals act.\n\n### **Practical Implications**\n\n- **Welfare Economics and Social Choice:** Incorporating CAPs alongside revealed preferences (which often capture IAPs) can lead to more holistic assessments of welfare that consider both strategic choices and deeper values.\n\n- **Policy Design:** Understanding whether policies align with CAPs or IAPs can enhance their effectiveness. Policies that resonate with individuals' constitutive values (CAPs) may foster greater engagement and long-term adherence.\n\n- **Personal Development:** Recognizing the balance between CAPs and IAPs can aid individuals in aligning their actions with their core values while strategically achieving their goals.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAligning CAPs and IAPs with existing human motivation frameworks provides a richer understanding of the complexities behind human behavior. **CAPs** correspond with motivations that are deeply embedded in one’s identity and intrinsic values, as seen in intrinsic motivations, self-actualization needs, and approach motivations. Conversely, **IAPs** align with goal-oriented, strategic behaviors driven by external rewards or the avoidance of negative outcomes, reflecting extrinsic motivations and instrumental values. Integrating this distinction into established theories offers valuable insights for fields like economics, psychology, and public policy, fostering approaches that respect both individual autonomy and strategic decision-making.",
