Data often clusters all entrepreneurs together without segregating sector type.\n\n---\n\n### 📝 Takeaways & Gaps\n\n- **Entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals** consistently show higher odds of suicidal ideation and attempts compared to traditional employees—even after adjusting for demographics.\n- **Tech/business founders** appear to face roughly *double the risk* of suicidal thoughts over their lifetimes.\n- **Social entrepreneurs** are notably *under-studied*—we lack specific international ideation or attempt rates.\n- The **global benchmark**: ~4% 12‑month ideation, ~9–19% lifetime, ~0.5–1% attempts.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Recommendations for Going Further\n\n- Commission dedicated surveys targeting **social-sector leaders**, differentiating them from commercial entrepreneurs.\n- Explore **regional/national datasets** for better granularity (e.g., OECD, WHO, CDC).\n- If you want, I can help locate and integrate more national studies or grey literature.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, I can format this into a downloadable chart or extend it with more country-by-country specifics.
