Bilal researches components, pricing, and creates comprehensive sizing tables for different household sizes and quality levels. This is capacity-building work for solar training in Iraq - connecting technical knowledge (solar engineering), educational mission (training), and MENA focus. Represents a key 2025 project identified in patterns report.",
