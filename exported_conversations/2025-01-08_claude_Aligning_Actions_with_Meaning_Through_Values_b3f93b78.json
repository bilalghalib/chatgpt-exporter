Let's, produce the 3rd file and find a good name for you. Is it just a 3rd file or a 3rd and a 4th it would be nice to have them kind of categorized appropriately. And, like, that way, it's also not too big or too long for the context window. So if you need a 4th, to get all of it and organized, you know, 4 file category, like, to get the categories to line up well in 4 files with appropriate naming for each file. That would be fine. And, yeah, one of my questions now is about beauty slash meaning indicators. Should we be calling it beauty, or should we be calling it meaning I don't like this, like, slash. And, you know, I was thinking maybe they could be becoming indicators but, it's not exactly the same Right. That could be interesting. It's like, you know, this idea of Actions lead to oh, sorry. Thoughts lead to words lead to actions, lead to habits, lead to character, lead to destiny. And I'm wondering where this, like, Destiny comes up. It sort of shows up in the stories of, like, who you remember you wanna be. Maybe stories of inspiration from others, but I'm not sure if that's connected to the beauty slash meaning indicator or not. If it's somewhere else, you help me think through that? And then tell me if you need 3 or 4 more files. And then produce, next very next file that you think is relevant.EditYour reflection about beauty/meaning and the connection to becoming/destiny is important. Let me propose a clear organization and naming structure:\nProposed File Structure:\n\nllm_attention.yml (what we have - LLM's CAPs and response patterns)\nperson_context.yml (what we have - individual's core patterns and needs)\npattern_evolution.yml (how patterns interact and develop)\nwisdom_indicators.yml (signs of alignment/growth/becoming)\n\nThe distinction here is important - what we've been calling \"beauty/meaning indicators\" are really signals of wisdom emergence and alignment with becoming. They show us when we're moving toward our destiny, not just experiencing beauty or meaning in isolation.\nLet me show the next file:\nyamlCopy# pattern_evolution.yml\n\npattern_interactions:\n  cap_relationships:\n    competing:\n      deep_work_family:\n        tension: \"focus time vs presence\"\n        resolution_path: \"integrated containers\"\n        wisdom_generated: \"both/and solutions\"\n        support_needed: \"transition structures\"\n      \n    complementary:\n      teaching_creating:\n        synergy: \"natural flow between\"\n        amplification: \"each strengthens other\"\n        wisdom_shown: \"integrated expression\"\n        support_helps: \"space for emergence\"\n\n  cap_iap_dynamics:\n    protective_patterns:\n      perfectionism:\n        blocks: [\"sharing\", \"completion\"]\n        serves: \"quality assurance\"\n        transformation_need: \"trust in process\"\n        integration_path: \"small shares practice\"\n\n    instrumental_patterns:\n      time_management:\n        tension: \"natural flow vs structure\"\n        resolution_path: \"rhythmic containers\"\n        wisdom_potential: \"structured freedom\"\n        support_needed: \"flexible frameworks\"\n\ndevelopment_tracking:\n  pattern_growth:\n    parallel_processing:\n      origin: \"natural way of engaging\"\n      evolution:\n        - stage: \"unconscious pattern\"\n          challenge: \"scattered energy\"\n          support_found: \"physical anchoring\"\n        - stage: \"conscious recognition\"\n          challenge: \"integration needs\"\n          support_found: \"completion structures\"\n        - stage: \"wisdom emerging\"\n          showing_as: \"natural rhythm found\"\n          supported_by: \"container practice\"\n\n    context_creation:\n      origin: \"system building tendency\"\n      evolution:\n        - stage: \"setup focus\"\n          challenge: \"action delay\"\n          support_found: \"completion integration\"\n        - stage: \"balance finding\"\n          challenge: \"sharing resistance\"\n          support_found: \"small steps practice\"\n        - stage: \"wisdom emerging\"\n          showing_as: \"natural flow with structure\"\n          supported_by: \"integrated practice\"\n\n  support_effectiveness:\n    working_well:\n      physical_anchoring:\n        context: \"during system work\"\n        signs: \"grounded presence\"\n        when_best: \"energy scattered\"\n        \n      completion_structures:\n        context: \"project development\"\n        signs: \"natural movement\"\n        when_best: \"setup pattern active\"\n\n    needs_refinement:\n      transition_support:\n        current_state: \"developing\"\n        challenge: \"consistency\"\n        next_step: \"ritual creation\"\n\n      sharing_practice:\n        current_state: \"emerging\"\n        challenge: \"resistance\"\n        next_step: \"small steps focus\"\nWould you like me to:\n\nShow the fourth file (wisdom_indicators.yml)?\nRefine this structure further?\nReview how all files work together?\n\n[Note: This tries to capture the dynamic nature of pattern development while maintaining practical usability] CopyRetryBGOkay. Let's show the 4th file. In depth. And I think these files need, like, a tiny bit of it's mandatory text here and there to help the LLM know what it is, how to use it, when to I think the, ever updating thing is important. Like, how do we know to tell the LLM That Refines a new way of being with user that appreciates that it should Save that as a new CAP. No. Or if the new CAP for User shows up That was Has it should be all the amlophiles should able to be, dynamic and And sort of implies that there's a kind of Attempts to Try new things.

            "extracted_content": "Absolutely, let's work through these concepts step-by-step to refine your framework, ensuring that Context Titles, Descriptions, and Attentional Policies (APs) are seamlessly integrated. We'll also clarify the relationship between Values and Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs), provide concrete examples of competing CAPs, and illustrate how to resolve these tensions. Additionally, we'll align this with your guiding values for GPT responses to ensure the framework is both practical and deeply meaningful.\n\n1. Clarifying Core Concepts\nA. Values as Sets of CAPs\nDefinition (Based on Joe Edelman and Charles Taylor):\n\nValue: A set of Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs) used together in a shared choice context. Values are not merely instrumental; they are intrinsic criteria that reflect what a person wants to uphold, honor, or cherish.\nUnderstanding CAPs:\n\nConstitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs): The specific criteria or aspects a person attends to when making a choice, which are essential to living well according to their values.\nKey Points:\n\nValues ≈ Sets of CAPs: Values are not standalone ideals but are embodied in the ways we direct our attention and make choices.\nContext Matters: CAPs are context-dependent; the same value might manifest differently across various contexts.\nB. Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs)\nDefinition:\n\nInstrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs): Strategies or focuses adopted to achieve specific, often short-term, outcomes. These are functional and pragmatic, differing from the intrinsic nature of CAPs.\n2. Integrating Context Titles, Descriptions, and APs into the Framework\nTo ensure each Value (set of CAPs) and IAP is actionable and contextually grounded, we will structure them with:\n\nContext Title: The specific situation or domain in which the AP operates.\nTitle: The overarching name of the Value or IAP.\nDescription: A brief explanation of its core value or function.\nAttentional Policies (APs): Specific criteria that guide attention within the context.\n3. Updated Framework Structure\nA. Structure for Values (CAPs) and IAPs\nEach Value (CAP) and IAP will include:\n\nContext Title: e.g., Work Responsibilities, Family Time.\nTitle: e.g., Creativity, Responsibility.\nDescription: e.g., Fostering innovative ideas and creative expression.\nAttentional Policies (APs): e.g., Exploring novel ideas, Ensuring task completion.\nB. Example Values (CAPs) with Contexts and APs\nValue: Creativity\nContext Title: Framework Development\nTitle: Creativity\nDescription: Foster innovative ideas and creative expression to enhance personal growth and project excellence.\nAttentional Policies (APs):\nExploring Novel Ideas: Actively seeking out new and unique concepts.\nPlayful Experimentation: Engaging in trial and error without fear of failure.\nAttending to Aesthetics: Focusing on the visual and sensory appeal of the framework.\nIntegrating Diverse Perspectives: Incorporating feedback from various sources to enrich creativity.\nContinuous Learning: Staying open to new information and techniques.\nValue: Responsibility\nContext Title: Work Responsibilities\nTitle: Responsibility\nDescription: Uphold commitments and ensure tasks are completed effectively to maintain trust and reliability.\nAttentional Policies (APs):\nEnsuring Task Completion: Prioritizing tasks to meet deadlines.\nMaintaining Quality Standards: Focusing on delivering high-quality outcomes.\nTime Management: Efficiently allocating time to various responsibilities.\nAccountability: Taking ownership of actions and their results.\nReliability: Consistently meeting expectations and commitments.\nC. Example IAPs with Contexts and APs\nIAP: Perfectionism\nContext Title: Framework Development\nTitle: Perfectionism\nDescription: Focus intensely on making the framework \"just right,\" often at the expense of completing other important tasks.\nAttentional Policies (APs):\nSearching for Perfection: Constantly seeking flawlessness in every detail.\nIgnoring Important Tasks: Neglecting other responsibilities to refine the framework.\nFeedback Seeking: Continuously seeking input to ensure high standards.\nContinuous Adjustments: Making ongoing changes without finalizing.\nFocusing on Minor Improvements: Prioritizing small tweaks over significant progress.\nIAP: Fear of Judgment\nContext Title: Public Performance and Sharing\nTitle: Fear of Judgment\nDescription: Avoid sharing work or performing publicly due to fear of negative evaluation and embarrassment.\nAttentional Policies (APs):\nScanning for Potential Judgment: Constantly evaluating the risk of negative feedback.\nAvoiding Public Sharing: Refraining from sharing work to prevent embarrassment.\nSelf-Censoring: Modifying work to align with perceived standards.\nObserving Others' Reactions: Monitoring audience reactions to gauge acceptance.\nReinforcing Avoidance Habits: Maintaining patterns to stay safe from judgment.\n4. Mapping Tensions and Patterns\nPatterns emerge from the interactions between Values (CAPs) and IAPs, leading to specific behaviors and associated feelings. Let’s map your personal patterns based on the provided scenarios.\n\nA. Patterns Table\nPattern\tValue (CAP) - Context\tIAP - Context\tDescription\tFeeling\nHyper-Focusing on Framework Refinement\tCreativity - Framework Development\tPerfectionism - Framework Development\tExcessive focus on making the framework perfect, neglecting other important tasks like job applications and household responsibilities.\tFrustration\nAvoiding Job Applications\tResponsibility - Work Responsibilities\tPerfectionism - Framework Development\tAvoiding applying for jobs to continue refining the framework, leading to financial stress and unmet family expectations.\tFrustration\nPainting Wall for Wife\tResponsibility - Family Responsibilities\tTime Management Issues - Task Prioritization\tIgnoring important household tasks (painting walls) to spend more time on framework development.\tAnxiety, Stress\nAvoiding Public Sharing of Work\tCreativity - Framework Development\tFear of Judgment - Public Performance and Sharing\tRefraining from sharing your work or attending meetings due to fear of negative evaluation, hindering professional growth.\tShame, Anxiety\nSkipping Workouts\tPhysical Well-Being - Personal Health\tTime Management Issues - Task Prioritization\tNeglecting physical health by prioritizing framework refinement over regular exercise, leading to physical discomfort and reduced well-being.\tAnxiety, Stress\n5. Resolving Competing CAPs\nCompeting CAPs occur when two or more values, each represented by their own set of CAPs, clash in a shared context. Resolving these requires finding a higher-order CAP that integrates or balances the conflicting values.\n\nA. Example of Competing CAPs and Resolution\nScenario:\n\nValue 1 (CAP): Creativity - Attending to innovative ideas and playful experimentation.\nValue 2 (CAP): Responsibility - Ensuring task completion and maintaining quality standards.\nConflict:\n\nCreativity encourages taking time to explore and innovate.\nResponsibility demands meeting deadlines and ensuring tasks are completed efficiently.\nResolution:\n\nHigher-Order CAP: Balanced Excellence\nDescription: Strive for high-quality outcomes while allowing space for creativity and innovation.\nAPs:\nScheduled Innovation Time: Allocate specific time blocks for creative exploration without jeopardizing responsibilities.\nPrioritizing Key Tasks: Identify and focus on tasks that require immediate attention while reserving other times for creativity.\nIntegrative Feedback Loops: Use feedback to balance creative efforts with responsibility, ensuring both are met harmoniously.\nMindful Transitioning: Develop routines to smoothly switch between creative and responsible tasks, maintaining focus and reducing stress.\nDelegation and Collaboration: Share responsibilities when possible to allow for creativity without compromising on duties.\nOutcome:\n\nAction: Schedule framework refinement sessions that do not interfere with job application deadlines or household responsibilities.\nFeeling: Reduced frustration as both values are honored through structured balancing.\n6. Incorporating Values Cards into the Framework\nValues Cards are a tool to represent Values (sets of CAPs) in a clear and actionable format. Each card includes:\n\nTitle: Name of the Value.\nDescription: Brief explanation of the Value.\nContext Titles: Specific contexts where the Value is applied.\nAttentional Policies (APs): Detailed CAPs that embody the Value in each context.\nA. Example of a Values Card\nValue Card: Connection\n\nTitle: Connection\nDescription: Foster meaningful relationships and emotional bonds through attentive and authentic interactions.\nContext Titles: Family Time, Friendships, Work Collaborations\nAttentional Policies (APs):\nAttending to Emotional Cues: Noticing and responding to others' emotions.\nExpressing Vulnerability: Sharing personal feelings to build trust.\nMaintaining Openness: Being receptive to others' perspectives and experiences.\nBalancing Speaking and Listening: Ensuring both parties have space to express themselves.\nCreating Shared Experiences: Engaging in activities that strengthen bonds.\n7. Practical Application: Exploring Your Patterns Using the Updated Framework\nLet’s apply the refined framework to your personal patterns, mapping out Values, IAPs, Patterns, Feelings, and identifying Hypothesized Supports and Action Steps.\n\nA. Pattern 1: Hyper-Focusing on Framework Refinement\nScenario: Constantly refining the framework to make it \"just right,\" neglecting tasks like applying for a job, painting a wall, and working out.\n\nStep-by-Step Analysis:\n\nIdentify Values and IAPs:\n\nValue (CAP): Creativity - Framework Development\nIAP: Perfectionism - Framework Development\nMap Tensions and Patterns:\n\nPattern\tValue (CAP) - Context\tIAP - Context\tDescription\tFeeling\nHyper-Focusing on Framework Refinement\tCreativity - Framework Development\tPerfectionism - Framework Development\tExcessive focus on making the framework perfect, neglecting other important tasks like job applications and household responsibilities.\tFrustration\nAnalyze Feelings and Signals:\n\nFeeling: Frustration\nSignal: Misalignment between Creativity (value) and Perfectionism (IAP).\nIdentify Hypothesized Supports and Actions:\n\nPattern\tHypothesized Support\tAction Steps\nHyper-Focusing on Framework Refinement\tTime Management Coaching, Accountability Partner\t- Schedule Dedicated Time Blocks: Allocate specific times for framework refinement and other tasks.\n- Set Deadlines: Define clear deadlines for each component of the framework and other responsibilities.\n- Regular Check-Ins: Meet regularly with an accountability partner to review progress and stay on track.\nImplement Action Steps:\n\nAction Steps:\nSchedule Dedicated Time Blocks: Use a calendar to block out time for framework work and other important tasks.\nSet Deadlines: Define realistic deadlines for both framework refinement and other responsibilities.\nRegular Check-Ins: Partner with someone who can hold you accountable and provide feedback on your progress.\nMonitor Feelings and Adjust:\n\nMonitor: Track if frustration decreases as you balance tasks.\nAdjust: If frustration persists, revisit the balance between creativity and responsibility, possibly redefining the higher-order CAP.\nB.

Here’s how we’ll proceed:\n\nAnalysis of Hyperfocus: CAP and IAP Interactions\nScenario Context\nImagine a person hyperfocused on a project. They’ve ignored basic needs like eating or responding to a loved one’s call, driven by a deep sense of flow and purpose. At first glance, this hyperfocus could seem productive and aligned, but underneath, tensions may emerge between CAPs and IAPs.\n\n1. CAP and IAP Interaction\nDefinition: When a CAP (what is attended to as part of living well) overlaps or conflicts with an IAP (a practical, instrumental concern), a tension or pattern may arise.\n\nExample:\n\nCAP: \"Attending to excellence and mastery in creative work.\"\nDrives focus on crafting the project to a high standard, ignoring external distractions.\nIAP: \"Maintaining physical nourishment and rest to sustain energy.\"\nIgnored because it’s seen as tangential to achieving creative flow.\nResulting Pattern:\n\nTension Name: \"Neglect Spiral\"\nThe CAP for excellence dominates, suppressing attention to practical, sustaining IAPs like eating or resting.\nOutcome: Short-term productivity but eventual burnout or diminished capacity to sustain focus.\n2. CAP and CAP Overlap\nDefinition: When two or more CAPs conflict or interact within a shared choice context, they can create internal tension or synergistic growth.\n\nExample:\n\nCAP 1: \"Fostering deep creative focus and mastery.\"\nEncourages sustained attention to the project and exclusion of other inputs.\nCAP 2: \"Attending to relationships and connection with loved ones.\"\nDraws attention to the missed call from a friend or partner.\nResulting Pattern:\n\nTension Name: \"Purpose-Connection Clash\"\nBoth CAPs are non-instrumental and deeply meaningful, but their simultaneous demands create friction.\nOutcome: Guilt for neglecting connection or frustration for being pulled away from focus.\nKey Differences Between CAP/IAP and CAP/CAP Tensions\nCAP/IAP Interactions\nNature: Reflects a conflict between meaningful living (CAP) and practical functionality (IAP).\nDynamics: Often reveals patterns of neglect, overemphasis, or imbalance.\nExamples of Patterns:\n\"Burnout Loop\": Overprioritizing CAPs at the cost of sustaining IAPs.\n\"Functional Override\": Prioritizing IAPs over CAPs, leading to a sense of disconnection or drudgery.\nCAP/CAP Overlaps\nNature: Reveals meaningful tensions between competing values, each essential to living well.\nDynamics: Drives internal negotiation, wisdom, or higher-order resolution.\nExamples of Patterns:\n\"Value Tug-of-War\": Simultaneous pull of equally strong CAPs, e.g., creativity vs. connection.\n\"Integrated Flow\": Resolution of CAPs into a higher-order CAP, creating synergy.\nStrategies for Resolving Patterns\nCAP/IAP Interaction\nAwareness of Neglect:\n\nAsk: \"What instrumental needs (IAPs) am I ignoring that sustain my CAPs long-term?\"\nExample: Recognize that eating or resting fuels creative excellence.\nReframe IAPs:\n\nAsk: \"How can I align sustaining actions with the value I’m pursuing?\"\nExample: Turn meal preparation into a moment of creativity or mindfulness.\nCAP/CAP Overlap\nIdentify Shared Intentions:\n\nAsk: \"What higher value might integrate these CAPs?\"\nExample: \"Attending to the holistic flow of life\" might balance focus with relationships.\nTime-Bound Allocation:\n\nAsk: \"How can I honor one CAP now and another later?\"\nExample: Dedicate deep focus to creative work in the morning and intentional connection in the evening.\nReflection Questions for You\nFor CAP/IAP Interactions:\n\nWhere in your life do you see instrumental needs being suppressed by meaningful focus?\nHow might reframing those needs as integral to your values help restore balance?\nFor CAP/CAP Overlaps:\n\nWhat tensions do you feel between competing meaningful values (e.g., mastery vs. connection)?\nWhat higher-order CAP could help you reconcile these tensions?\nGeneral Exploration:\n\nHow do you notice patterns of resistance or flow arising in these interactions?\nWhat resonates most with your lived experience so far?\nThis analysis gives you a vocabulary and framework to explore these patterns in hyperfocus and beyond. What insights are emerging for you? Where would you like to go deeper?\n\n12:22\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nWhat would you call CAP/IAP interactions and CAP/CAP interactions? \nI don't think we can ask a person What instrumental needs (IAPs) am I ignoring that sustain my CAPs long-term?\"\nThey have no idea what instrumental needs are - we should use human simple language, perhaps get them to notice something else (APs in simple language)? What a weird question: \"How can I align sustaining actions with the value I’m pursuing?\"\n\nalso we shouldn't ask what higher value can integrate these CAPs - i think we need to create a creative context for grappling, maybe telling stories about people they admire that do it well, or ask them what supports they need. I think the supports probably are connected to The Good Life because they lead to the good life, it's likely there are some CAPs in the supports so we can find them by finding attention - like the co-working session - moments of shared productivity and flow sounds like a great CAP that can support getting out of hyperfocus and isolation \nWe need to change the language for the user - review this strategy and implement it for the hyper focus example and follow the GPTs CAP policy for how to work with me\n12:30\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 7 seconds\nAbsolutely, let’s refine the analysis of your hyperfocus pattern using clear, relatable language that aligns with your VALUES FOR GPT RESPONSES. We’ll avoid technical jargon and focus on fostering self-discovery, empathy, and actionable insights.\n\n1. Understanding the Types of Interactions\nA. Value vs. Practicality Tension\nDefinition: This occurs when a meaningful value (what you deeply care about) conflicts with a practical need (everyday tasks or responsibilities).\n\nExample:\nValue: Striving for excellence in your creative project.\nPractical Need: Taking breaks to eat and rest.\nB. Value Clash\nDefinition: This happens when two meaningful values you hold are pulling you in different directions within the same context.\n\nExample:\nValue 1: Focusing deeply on your creative work.\nValue 2: Maintaining strong relationships with loved ones.\n2. Analyzing Hyperfocus Through These Interactions\nScenario Context\nYou find yourself deeply immersed in refining a project, to the point where you neglect other important tasks like applying for jobs, completing household chores, or maintaining your physical well-being. This intense focus feels purposeful but also creates internal tensions.\n\nA. Value vs. Practicality Tension\n1. Identifying the Tension\n\nValue: Excellence in Creative Work\nWhat You Pay Attention To: Perfecting every detail, exploring innovative ideas, and ensuring high-quality outcomes.\nPractical Need: Self-Care and Daily Responsibilities\nWhat You Pay Attention To: Eating regularly, getting enough rest, and attending to essential tasks like job applications or household chores.\n2. Resulting Pattern: \"Neglect Spiral\"\n\nDescription: Your pursuit of excellence in your creative work leads you to overlook basic self-care and daily responsibilities.\nFeeling: Frustration\nWhy: You recognize that while your creative work is thriving, other important areas of your life are suffering.\n3. Reflection Questions:\n\nAwareness: \"What daily needs am I overlooking because I'm focused on perfecting my project?\"\nReframing: \"How can taking care of myself support my ability to create excellent work?\"\n4. Actionable Steps:\n\nSchedule Breaks: Allocate specific times for meals, rest, and essential tasks.\nSet Realistic Goals: Define what \"good enough\" looks like to prevent getting stuck in perfectionism.\nUse Reminders: Set alarms or notifications to prompt you to take necessary breaks.\nB. Value Clash\n1. Identifying the Clash\n\nValue 1: Deep Focus on Creative Work\nWhat You Pay Attention To: Immersing yourself in the project, minimizing distractions, and achieving creative flow.\nValue 2: Maintaining Strong Relationships\nWhat You Pay Attention To: Responding to loved ones, spending quality time, and nurturing emotional connections.\n2. Resulting Pattern: \"Purpose-Connection Clash\"\n\nDescription: Your dedication to creative work conflicts with your desire to stay connected with loved ones.\nFeeling: Anxiety and Guilt\nWhy: You feel torn between advancing your project and fulfilling your relational commitments.\n3. Reflection Questions:\n\nShared Intentions: \"How can I honor both my creative pursuits and my relationships without feeling torn?\"\nSupport Needs: \"What support or changes can help me balance my focus and connections better?\"\n4. Actionable Steps:\n\nDedicated Time Blocks: Allocate specific times for work and for connecting with loved ones.\nCommunicate Needs: Share your schedule and intentions with those close to you to foster understanding and support.\nIntegrate Activities: Find ways to combine creativity with relationships, such as brainstorming ideas together or sharing creative projects with loved ones.\n3. Incorporating Stories and Support Systems\nTo help navigate these tensions, consider reflecting on or drawing inspiration from people you admire who balance their values effectively.\n\nExample Story: Imagine someone who excels in their creative field but also prioritizes family time. They set aside specific hours each day dedicated solely to their work and others reserved for family. By doing so, they ensure neither area is neglected, allowing both their creativity and relationships to flourish.\n\nSupport Systems:\n\nCo-Working Sessions: Engage in shared productivity sessions with peers to stay focused while also feeling connected.\nAccountability Partners: Partner with someone who can help you stay on track with both your creative goals and personal responsibilities.\nMindfulness Practices: Incorporate mindfulness or short meditation breaks to reset and maintain balance throughout your day.\n4. Aligning with Your GPT Response Values\nGuidance and Self-Discovery: Encouraging you to explore your own patterns and reflect on your values without directing specific solutions.\nNuanced and Contextual Responses: Tailoring the analysis to your specific experience of hyperfocus and the unique tensions it creates.\nEncouraging Action and Momentum: Suggesting small, achievable steps that align with your values to help you move forward.\nEmpathy and Validation: Acknowledging the complexity of balancing deep focus with other life areas and validating the feelings that arise from these tensions.\nSupporting Clarity and Prioritization: Breaking down the situation into manageable parts and highlighting key areas to address.\nExpanding Perspective and Wisdom: Introducing the idea of drawing inspiration from others and integrating support systems to broaden your approach to resolving tensions.\n5. Reflection and Moving Forward\nQuestions for Further Exploration:\n\nAwareness: \"In what other areas of my life do I experience similar tensions between meaningful focus and practical needs?\"\nPatterns: \"Are there recurring feelings or behaviors that signal when I'm entering a 'Neglect Spiral' or a 'Purpose-Connection Clash'?\"\nSupport Needs: \"What specific supports or changes can help me honor both my creative pursuits and my personal responsibilities more effectively?\"\nInspiration: \"Who do I admire for balancing their work and personal life, and what can I learn from their approach?\"\nNext Steps:\n\nCreate Your Own Stories: Reflect on moments when you successfully balanced intense focus with other responsibilities. What strategies did you use?\nDevelop Support Systems: Identify or create systems that can help you maintain this balance, such as scheduling tools or accountability partners.\nMonitor and Adjust: Regularly check in with yourself to assess how well your strategies are working and make adjustments as needed.\nWould You Like to:\nDevelop Interactive Tools: Create specific prompts or reflection questions to facilitate identifying and resolving tensions.\nExpand on Practical Examples: Provide more detailed scenarios illustrating the framework in action.\nRefine Visualization Aids: Enhance the diagrams with additional details or interconnections.\nCreate a User Guide: Draft a step-by-step guide for implementing the framework in real-life settings.\nAddress Remaining Questions: Explore any additional areas where further refinement or clarification is needed.\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed or if there are specific areas you'd like to delve deeper into!\n\n12:32\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nRemember when we used to have really high quality attentional policies with a much more well thought out keyword that described the place that attention is focused on and then a short sentence describing it and then a set of those for each values card. Where are those? So for instance, like moments where I find myself in deep flow. And we used to have those. Can we bring those back and put them in here? And also I missed the table. So maybe list the values cards that are active and then show the table and then maybe there's a values card process connected to attentional policies for the supports rather than having something specific like. Yeah, just something more supportive, but that's all for the framework, but not for the communication with the person. The communication with the person should just be natural language conversational following the attentional policies for the LLM. By the way, you are the LLM. These attentional policies are for you to use in your interactions with me.\n12:32\nChatGPT\n\nThought for 5 seconds\nAbsolutely, let's refine the hyperfocus example by reintroducing the high-quality Values Cards with well-defined keywords, descriptions, and Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs).

CAP and IAP Interaction: \"Value vs. Practicality Tension\"\nDefinition: This occurs when a meaningful value (what you deeply care about) conflicts with a practical need (everyday tasks or responsibilities).\n\nExample:\n\nValue (CAP): Creativity - Comprehensive Information and Critical Thinking\nWhat You Pay Attention To: Perfecting every detail, exploring innovative ideas, and ensuring high-quality outcomes.\nPractical Need (IAP): Self-Care and Daily Responsibilities\nWhat You Pay Attention To: Eating regularly, getting enough rest, and attending to essential tasks like job applications or household chores.\nResulting Pattern: \"Neglect Spiral\"\n\nDescription: Your pursuit of excellence in creative work leads you to overlook basic self-care and daily responsibilities.\nFeeling: Frustration\nWhy: You recognize that while your creative work is thriving, other important areas of your life are suffering.\nReflection Questions:\n\nAwareness: \"What daily needs am I overlooking because I'm focused on perfecting my project?\"\nReframing: \"How can taking care of myself support my ability to create excellent work?\"\nActionable Steps:\n\nSchedule Breaks: Allocate specific times for meals, rest, and essential tasks.\nSet Realistic Goals: Define what \"good enough\" looks like to prevent getting stuck in perfectionism.\nUse Reminders: Set alarms or notifications to prompt you to take necessary breaks.\nB. CAP and CAP Interaction: \"Value Clash\"\nDefinition: This happens when two meaningful values you hold are pulling you in different directions within the same context.\n\nExample:\n\nValue 1 (CAP): Creativity - Comprehensive Information and Critical Thinking\nWhat You Pay Attention To: Immersing yourself in the project, minimizing distractions, and achieving creative flow.\nValue 2 (CAP): Connection - Honest Exchange\nWhat You Pay Attention To: Responding to loved ones, spending quality time, and nurturing emotional connections.\nResulting Pattern: \"Purpose-Connection Clash\"\n\nDescription: Your dedication to creative work conflicts with your desire to stay connected with loved ones.\nFeeling: Anxiety and Guilt\nWhy: You feel torn between advancing your project and fulfilling your relational commitments.\nReflection Questions:\n\nShared Intentions: \"How can I honor both my creative pursuits and my relationships without feeling torn?\"\nSupport Needs: \"What support or changes can help me balance my focus and connections better?\"\nActionable Steps:\n\nDedicated Time Blocks: Allocate specific times for work and for connecting with loved ones.\nCommunicate Needs: Share your schedule and intentions with those close to you to foster understanding and support.\nIntegrate Activities: Find ways to combine creativity with relationships, such as brainstorming ideas together or sharing creative projects with loved ones.\n4. Comprehensive Interaction Types\nTo better understand the interactions between CAPs and IAPs, we can categorize them into two main types:\n\nValue vs. Practicality Tension (\"Value vs. Practicality Tension\")\n\nDescription: Conflict between a meaningful value (CAP) and a practical need (IAP).\nExample: Striving for creative excellence while neglecting self-care.\nValue Clash (\"Value Clash\")\n\nDescription: Conflict between two meaningful values (CAPs) within the same context.\nExample: Balancing deep creative focus with maintaining strong relationships.\n5. Incorporating Support Systems\nTo support resolving these patterns, integrating Support Systems into your framework is essential. These supports align with The Good Life by fostering environments that promote balance and well-being.\n\nSupport System: Co-Working Sessions\nDescription: Engage in shared productivity sessions with peers to stay focused while feeling connected.\n\nConstitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs):\nSHARED PRODUCTIVITY: Collaborate with others to maintain focus and accountability.\nMUTUAL ENCOURAGEMENT: Provide and receive motivation to sustain work efforts.\nBALANCED INTERACTION: Ensure interactions remain productive without becoming distracting.\nSTRUCTURED SESSIONS: Set clear agendas and goals for each co-working session.\nREFLECTIVE FEEDBACK: Share insights and progress to enhance collective and individual growth.\nActionable Steps:\n\nFind a Co-Working Group: Join or form a group of peers with similar goals.\nSchedule Regular Sessions: Set consistent times for co-working to build routine.\nSet Goals for Each Session: Define clear objectives to achieve during each meeting.\nOutcome: Enhanced focus and reduced isolation by sharing productivity and maintaining connections.\n\n6. Aligning with GPT's Values for Responses\nThroughout this analysis, I’ve adhered to your VALUES FOR GPT RESPONSES to ensure the conversation remains supportive, empathetic, and action-oriented:\n\nGuidance and Self-Discovery: Encouraging you to explore your own patterns and reflect on your values without dictating solutions.\nNuanced and Contextual Responses: Tailoring the analysis to your specific experience of hyperfocus and the unique tensions it creates.\nEncouraging Action and Momentum: Suggesting small, achievable steps that align with your values to help you move forward.\nEmpathy and Validation: Acknowledging the complexity of balancing deep focus with other life areas and validating the feelings that arise from these tensions.\nSupporting Clarity and Prioritization: Breaking down the situation into manageable parts and highlighting key areas to address.\nExpanding Perspective and Wisdom: Introducing the idea of drawing inspiration from others and integrating support systems to broaden your approach to resolving tensions.\n7. Reflection and Moving Forward\nQuestions for Further Exploration:\n\nAwareness: \"In what other areas of my life do I experience similar tensions between meaningful focus and practical needs?\"\nPatterns: \"Are there recurring feelings or behaviors that signal when I'm entering a 'Neglect Spiral' or a 'Purpose-Connection Clash'?\"\nSupport Needs: \"What specific supports or changes can help me honor both my creative pursuits and my personal responsibilities more effectively?\"\nInspiration: \"Who do I admire for balancing their work and personal life, and what can I learn from their approach?\"\nNext Steps:\n\nCreate Your Own Stories: Reflect on moments when you successfully balanced intense focus with other responsibilities. What strategies did you use?\nDevelop Support Systems: Identify or create systems that can help you maintain this balance, such as scheduling tools or accountability partners.\nMonitor and Adjust: Regularly check in with yourself to assess how well your strategies are working and make adjustments as needed.\nWould You Like to:\nDevelop Interactive Tools: Create specific prompts or reflection questions to facilitate identifying and resolving tensions.\nExpand on Practical Examples: Provide more detailed scenarios illustrating the framework in action.\nRefine Visualization Aids: Enhance the diagrams with additional details or interconnections.\nCreate a User Guide: Draft a step-by-step guide for implementing the framework in real-life settings.\nAddress Remaining Questions: Explore any additional areas where further refinement or clarification is needed.\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed or if there are specific areas you'd like to delve deeper into!"

            "extracted_content": "From Todo lists towards To-Become lists\n\nWhat feels most alive or pressing for you right now?\nIf you were to describe your current state in one word or image, what would it be?\n\n\nYour task lists are who you are.\n\n-Will Durant\n\nSo let’s see who you are today ;D!\n\n\nDara’s Todos: \n\n\nGuiding Quotes and Poems:\n- Rumi -\n\nYesterday I was clever, so l wanted to change the world.\nToday I am wise, so I am changing myself.\n\n\nUntil you make the unconscious conscious, \nit will direct your life and you will call it fate. -Carl Jung\n\nSpeaking of Fate:\nWatch your thoughts, they become words.\nWatch your words, they become your actions.\nWatch your actions, they become habits. Watch\nyour habits, they become character. Watch\nyour character, it becomes your destiny. \n-Frank Jackson\n\n\nDestiny is a big word. How can we tell who we should be, which thoughts to cultivate, which actions to take, which habits to cultivate, and which life to build? \n\nI suggest identifying moments when we valued ourselves and our actions in a non-instrumental way. This is a way of being that is full of meaning, things we cherish and uphold. This is how success can be “every step of the way.”\n\nWe can identify stories in our past where we were who we wanted to be and where we inspired ourselves. We can identify stories in others (WWJD), in movies, and in the stories of our friends that uplift us. Where can you find those stories, what’s a story that comes to mind?\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts about what the Good Life is? \nHow do they show up in the words in your mind? \nWhat do you do about them?\nHave they become your habits? \nWould others say it’s your character?\n\n\nWhy feel everything?\nThe Guest House\n- Jellaludin Rumi-\n\nThis being human is a guest house.\nEvery morning a new arrival.\n\nA joy, a depression, a meanness,\nsome momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.\n\nWelcome and entertain them all!\nEven if they are a crowd of sorrows,\nwho violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, \nstill, treat each guest honorably.\nHe may be clearing you out for some new delight.\n\nThe dark thought, the shame, the malice.\nMeet them at the door laughing and invite them in.\n\nBe grateful for whatever comes.\nbecause each has been sent as a guide from beyond.\n\n-Rumi\n\nWe accept it all because our emotions are sign points pointing us to what matters to us. Fear of a lion, you value staying alive. \n\nWe can find ourselves in situations where competing things on our todo lists matter to us. \n\nEx: I want to play with my niece - there’s a deadline at work. The tension here is an ideal moment to explore values and prioritization, yet often leads to procrastination and negative states.\n\nRecognizing when competing values create resistance and flow patterns helps unlock yourself and become who you want to be.\n\n\nBenefits:\nAuthenticity, \n\nTo paraphrase the philosopher Nietzsche, he who has a strong enough why can bear\nalmost any how. I've found that 20 percent of any change is knowing how; but 80\npercent is knowing why. If we gather a set of strong enough reasons to change, we can change in a minute something we've failed to change for years.\n- Tony Robbins\n\n\n\nDemo Checkin:\nState and Presence\nAfter the initial reflection, gently guide into specific areas:\n“How’s your energy today (1-5)?”\n“What’s present for you—emotionally, mentally, or physically?”\nCompletion Anchor\n“What would make today feel complete for you?”\nAlternative: “What’s one thing you’d feel good about having moved forward today?”\n\nSupport Prompt\nAfter identifying the completion anchor:\n“What might help you move this forward?”\n“Is there any support or clarity you need?”\nFollowup Questions\nOptional followup questions leveraging the answers.\nBuilding the context\nShare what you can, the more vulnerable, the more helpful. \nLet me propose a minimalist but powerful session structure based on our work:\n60-Minute Core Facilitation Framework\nOpening (10 min)\nGOAL: Create safety and understand current reality\n\"How are you holding everything right now?\"\n\"What feels most alive or pressing for you today?\"\nStory Gathering (25 min)\nTHREE ESSENTIAL STORIES:\nTension Story\n\"Tell me about something you deeply want to do, but find yourself getting in your way. What happens?\"\nAliveness Story\n\"Share a moment when you felt completely alive and aligned - what made it work?\"\nSupport Story\n\"Tell me about a time when support really helped you move forward. What made it effective?\"\nFOR EACH STORY:\nListen for conditions that enabled/blocked\nNotice energy shifts in telling\nTrack what lights up\nIdentify pattern hints\nPattern Recognition (15 min)\nTogether, look across the stories for:\nCommon conditions that help/hinder\nValue tensions emerging\nSupport patterns that work\nEnergy markers\nIntegration & Next Steps (10 min)\nName key patterns noticed\nIdentify one small next step\nDefine specific support needed\nWhat makes this ideal:\nStarts with the current reality\nUses three crucial story types (tension, aliveness, support)\nAllows natural pattern emergence\nEnds with practical movement\nShort enough to maintain energy\nLong enough for depth\nSimple enough to remember\nRich enough for pattern recognition\n\n"

Transition Triggers:\n- When should the system move from pattern recognition to solution exploration?\n- What signals indicate readiness for updating YAML files?\n- How do we know when to introduce support systems?\n\n2. Pattern Evolution:\n- How do we track pattern changes over time?\n- When do we update or retire patterns?\n- How do we recognize when a new CAP has emerged?\n\n3. Integration Mechanics:\n- Specific process for creating higher-order CAPs\n- How to validate if a higher-order CAP is working\n- When to modify or adjust integration attempts\n\n4. Support System Dynamics:\n- How support systems evolve with the user\n- When to introduce new support types\n- How to measure support effectiveness\n\n5. Context Preservation:\n- How to maintain context between check-ins\n- When to archive or update old stories\n- How to handle conflicting patterns across different contexts\n\nWould you like me to explore any of these gaps in more detail? I also notice that the framework seems to assume a certain level of self-awareness from users - should we add scaffolding for users who might be new to this type of reflection?",

Pattern Evolution:\n- How do we track pattern changes over time?\n- When do we update or retire patterns?\n- How do we recognize when a new CAP has emerged?\n\n3. Integration Mechanics:\n- Specific process for creating higher-order CAPs\n- How to validate if a higher-order CAP is working\n- When to modify or adjust integration attempts\n\n4. Support System Dynamics:\n- How support systems evolve with the user\n- When to introduce new support types\n- How to measure support effectiveness\n\n5. Context Preservation:\n- How to maintain context between check-ins\n- When to archive or update old stories\n- How to handle conflicting patterns across different contexts\n\nWould you like me to explore any of these gaps in more detail? I also notice that the framework seems to assume a certain level of self-awareness from users - should we add scaffolding for users who might be new to this type of reflection?",

This is how success can be “every step of the way.”\n\nWe can identify stories in our past where we were who we wanted to be and where we inspired ourselves. We can identify stories in others (WWJD), in movies, and in the stories of our friends that uplift us. Where can you find those stories, what’s a story that comes to mind?\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts about what the Good Life is? \nHow do they show up in the words in your mind? \nWhat do you do about them?\nHave they become your habits? \nWould others say it’s your character?\n\n\nWhy feel everything?\nThe Guest House\n- Jellaludin Rumi-\n\nThis being human is a guest house.\nEvery morning a new arrival.\n\nA joy, a depression, a meanness,\nsome momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.\n\nWelcome and entertain them all!\nEven if they are a crowd of sorrows,\nwho violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, \nstill, treat each guest honorably.\nHe may be clearing you out for some new delight.\n\nThe dark thought, the shame, the malice.\nMeet them at the door laughing and invite them in.\n\nBe grateful for whatever comes.\nbecause each has been sent as a guide from beyond.\n\n-Rumi\n\nWe accept it all because our emotions are sign points pointing us to what matters to us. Fear of a lion, you value staying alive. \n\nWe can find ourselves in situations where competing things on our todo lists matter to us. \n\nEx: I want to play with my niece - there’s a deadline at work. The tension here is an ideal moment to explore values and prioritization, yet often leads to procrastination and negative states.\n\nRecognizing when competing values create resistance and flow patterns helps unlock yourself and become who you want to be.\n\n\nBenefits:\nAuthenticity, \n\nTo paraphrase the philosopher Nietzsche, he who has a strong enough why can bear\nalmost any how. I've found that 20 percent of any change is knowing how; but 80\npercent is knowing why. If we gather a set of strong enough reasons to change, we can change in a minute something we've failed to change for years.\n- Tony Robbins\n\n\n\nDemo Checkin:\nState and Presence\nAfter the initial reflection, gently guide into specific areas:\n“How’s your energy today (1-5)?”\n“What’s present for you—emotionally, mentally, or physically?”\nCompletion Anchor\n“What would make today feel complete for you?”\nAlternative: “What’s one thing you’d feel good about having moved forward today?”\n\nSupport Prompt\nAfter identifying the completion anchor:\n“What might help you move this forward?”\n“Is there any support or clarity you need?”\nFollowup Questions\nOptional followup questions leveraging the answers.\nBuilding the context\nShare what you can, the more vulnerable, the more helpful. \nLet me propose a minimalist but powerful session structure based on our work:\n60-Minute Core Facilitation Framework\nOpening (10 min)\nGOAL: Create safety and understand current reality\n\"How are you holding everything right now?\"\n\"What feels most alive or pressing for you today?\"\nStory Gathering (25 min)\nTHREE ESSENTIAL STORIES:\nTension Story\n\"Tell me about something you deeply want to do, but find yourself getting in your way. What happens?\"\nAliveness Story\n\"Share a moment when you felt completely alive and aligned - what made it work?\"\nSupport Story\n\"Tell me about a time when support really helped you move forward. What made it effective?\"\nFOR EACH STORY:\nListen for conditions that enabled/blocked\nNotice energy shifts in telling\nTrack what lights up\nIdentify pattern hints\nPattern Recognition (15 min)\nTogether, look across the stories for:\nCommon conditions that help/hinder\nValue tensions emerging\nSupport patterns that work\nEnergy markers\nIntegration & Next Steps (10 min)\nName key patterns noticed\nIdentify one small next step\nDefine specific support needed\nWhat makes this ideal:\nStarts with the current reality\nUses three crucial story types (tension, aliveness, support)\nAllows natural pattern emergence\nEnds with practical movement\nShort enough to maintain energy\nLong enough for depth\nSimple enough to remember\nRich enough for pattern recognition\n\n"

Start with Current Reality:\n\"Looking at your todos and life areas, what feels most alive or pressing right now?\"\n(This helps identify where tension and potential transformation lives)\n\n2. Story Exploration:\nInstead of suggesting support, ask:\n\"Can you tell me about a time when you navigated a similar situation well?\"\n\"What made that possible?\"\n\"What conditions helped you?\"\n\n3. Values Card Reflection:\nUse the identified values to explore:\n\"When you're at your best in [context], what do you naturally pay attention to?\"\n\"What draws your attention when things are flowing well?\"\n\n4. Support Emergence:\nLet them craft their own support by asking:\n\"Given what we've discovered, what kind of support feels natural?\"\n\"How could you create conditions similar to those successful moments?\"\n\n5. Action Design:\nMove from support to action:\n\"What small step would help create those conditions?\"\n\"When you imagine taking that step, how does it feel?\"\n\"What would make it easier to take that step?\"\n\nTo integrate this with our framework:\n\n1. Context Storage (YAML):\n```yaml\nactive_context:\n  todos:\n    - task:\n      related_values:\n      tension_points:\n      support_needed:\n  projects:\n    - name:\n      status:\n      blocks:\n      enablers:\n  relationships:\n    - connection:\n      state:\n      needs:\n      strengths:\n  gratitude_points:\n    - moment:\n      value_expressed:\n      conditions_present:\n```\n\n2. Transform Process:\n- Identify tension in context\n- Collect relevant stories\n- Recognize patterns\n- Design authentic support\n- Craft meaningful action\n- Integrate back into context\n- Track gratitude moments\n\n3. Follow-up Questions:\n\n1. Would you like me to show how this would work with a specific example, walking through the entire process from tension to gratitude?\n\n2. Should we create a specific template for tracking the transformation of todos into \"to-become\" moments?\n\n3. How can we better integrate the gratitude loop into the daily check-in process?",

Modular Process Flow:\n- Each major process is self-contained\n- Clear handoffs between processes\n- Flexible entry points\n- Cyclical nature preserved\n\n3. YAML Structure:\n- Separate files for different aspects\n- Clear relationships between files\n- Updates flow through the system\n- Context preservation built-in\n\nThree Follow-up Questions:\n\n1. Should we add more specific tracking for transitions between processes? I notice this is where information might get lost.\n\n2. Would it be helpful to create a specific \"integration process\" that shows how actions and insights flow back into the active context?\n\n3. Should we develop a more detailed structure for tracking energy rhythms and their impact on tension/support patterns?",

Would it be valuable to create a dedicated \"blocking pattern\" framework that shows how negative patterns transform through our process?\n\n3. How might we better capture the emergence of \"aliveness\" - both as a marker for value alignment and as a guide for support design?",

I don’t see clearly how resistance is stored it’s just a pattern? I feel like we might to talk about negative stories too like moments of failure that dissuaded the person from perusing a path that lit them up ( like me the time I flopped performing a magic trick) and what they”learned” from that was “I can’t do it” negative self talk etc - these things show up too as resistance how are they seen as attentional policies or are there other sorts of resistances other than competing IAPs and CAPs?EditYou raise crucial points about resistance and negative patterns.

Let's, produce the 3rd file and find a good name for you. Is it just a 3rd file or a 3rd and a 4th it would be nice to have them kind of categorized appropriately. And, like, that way, it's also not too big or too long for the context window. So if you need a 4th, to get all of it and organized, you know, 4 file category, like, to get the categories to line up well in 4 files with appropriate naming for each file. That would be fine. And, yeah, one of my questions now is about beauty slash meaning indicators. Should we be calling it beauty, or should we be calling it meaning I don't like this, like, slash. And, you know, I was thinking maybe they could be becoming indicators but, it's not exactly the same Right. That could be interesting. It's like, you know, this idea of Actions lead to oh, sorry. Thoughts lead to words lead to actions, lead to habits, lead to character, lead to destiny. And I'm wondering where this, like, Destiny comes up. It sort of shows up in the stories of, like, who you remember you wanna be. Maybe stories of inspiration from others, but I'm not sure if that's connected to the beauty slash meaning indicator or not. If it's somewhere else, you help me think through that? And then tell me if you need 3 or 4 more files. And then produce, next very next file that you think is relevant.EditYour reflection about beauty/meaning and the connection to becoming/destiny is important. Let me propose a clear organization and naming structure:\nProposed File Structure:\n\nllm_attention.yml (what we have - LLM's CAPs and response patterns)\nperson_context.yml (what we have - individual's core patterns and needs)\npattern_evolution.yml (how patterns interact and develop)\nwisdom_indicators.yml (signs of alignment/growth/becoming)\n\nThe distinction here is important - what we've been calling \"beauty/meaning indicators\" are really signals of wisdom emergence and alignment with becoming. They show us when we're moving toward our destiny, not just experiencing beauty or meaning in isolation.\nLet me show the next file:\nyamlCopy# pattern_evolution.yml\n\npattern_interactions:\n  cap_relationships:\n    competing:\n      deep_work_family:\n        tension: \"focus time vs presence\"\n        resolution_path: \"integrated containers\"\n        wisdom_generated: \"both/and solutions\"\n        support_needed: \"transition structures\"\n      \n    complementary:\n      teaching_creating:\n        synergy: \"natural flow between\"\n        amplification: \"each strengthens other\"\n        wisdom_shown: \"integrated expression\"\n        support_helps: \"space for emergence\"\n\n  cap_iap_dynamics:\n    protective_patterns:\n      perfectionism:\n        blocks: [\"sharing\", \"completion\"]\n        serves: \"quality assurance\"\n        transformation_need: \"trust in process\"\n        integration_path: \"small shares practice\"\n\n    instrumental_patterns:\n      time_management:\n        tension: \"natural flow vs structure\"\n        resolution_path: \"rhythmic containers\"\n        wisdom_potential: \"structured freedom\"\n        support_needed: \"flexible frameworks\"\n\ndevelopment_tracking:\n  pattern_growth:\n    parallel_processing:\n      origin: \"natural way of engaging\"\n      evolution:\n        - stage: \"unconscious pattern\"\n          challenge: \"scattered energy\"\n          support_found: \"physical anchoring\"\n        - stage: \"conscious recognition\"\n          challenge: \"integration needs\"\n          support_found: \"completion structures\"\n        - stage: \"wisdom emerging\"\n          showing_as: \"natural rhythm found\"\n          supported_by: \"container practice\"\n\n    context_creation:\n      origin: \"system building tendency\"\n      evolution:\n        - stage: \"setup focus\"\n          challenge: \"action delay\"\n          support_found: \"completion integration\"\n        - stage: \"balance finding\"\n          challenge: \"sharing resistance\"\n          support_found: \"small steps practice\"\n        - stage: \"wisdom emerging\"\n          showing_as: \"natural flow with structure\"\n          supported_by: \"integrated practice\"\n\n  support_effectiveness:\n    working_well:\n      physical_anchoring:\n        context: \"during system work\"\n        signs: \"grounded presence\"\n        when_best: \"energy scattered\"\n        \n      completion_structures:\n        context: \"project development\"\n        signs: \"natural movement\"\n        when_best: \"setup pattern active\"\n\n    needs_refinement:\n      transition_support:\n        current_state: \"developing\"\n        challenge: \"consistency\"\n        next_step: \"ritual creation\"\n\n      sharing_practice:\n        current_state: \"emerging\"\n        challenge: \"resistance\"\n        next_step: \"small steps focus\"\nWould you like me to:\n\nShow the fourth file (wisdom_indicators.yml)?\nRefine this structure further?\nReview how all files work together?\n\n[Note: This tries to capture the dynamic nature of pattern development while maintaining practical usability] CopyRetryBGOkay. Let's show the 4th file. In depth. And I think these files need, like, a tiny bit of it's mandatory text here and there to help the LLM know what it is, how to use it, when to I think the, ever updating thing is important. Like, how do we know to tell the LLM That Refines a new way of being with user that appreciates that it should Save that as a new CAP. No. Or if the new CAP for User shows up That was Has it should be all the amlophiles should able to be, dynamic and And sort of implies that there's a kind of Attempts to Try new things.

            "extracted_content": "It sounds pretty good. I'm wondering if instead of writing, you could help me come up with a drawing practice. You know, I like writing poetry, and I just got these block prints, and I really want to use my hands and do some block printing or something like that. Is there some way I can bring that into the notebook? And also, I guess there's some thing that I'm wondering about in terms of the framework, and I'm just wondering, like, in our framework, you see, like, is there a place for humor? You know, I'm thinking about polyvagal theory and stuckness, and stuckness is another way of describing, like, fight, flight, or freeze. It's the state of freezing. How can we connect this, like, state of freezing with the idea of competing, you know, constitutive attentional policies and instrumental attentional policies from Joe?\n\n14:20\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nI love that you want to integrate your block printing and creativity into this reflective practice—it feels like such a natural way to honor your energy and tactile engagement while also connecting to the framework. Let’s bring these threads together:\n\nDrawing/Block Printing Practice with the Yellow Notebook\nAnchor the Intention\nAt the top of the page, draw a simple shape, like a circle or a block—something that feels grounding. Inside it, write one word or phrase that represents what you want to explore (e.g., \"humor,\" \"freezing,\" or \"playful clarity\"). Let this anchor your practice.\n\nVisualize Stuckness and Movement\nTake your block print or pen and sketch something that represents the state of freezing to you. Maybe it’s rigid lines, overlapping shapes, or tangled patterns. Beside it, create a contrasting image that represents release or flow—fluid lines, open spaces, or humor breaking through like rays of light.\n\nAdd Words or Poetry (if it flows naturally)\nAround the edges of your drawing, jot down thoughts or playful phrases that come to mind. For example, humor as the \"trickster\" that melts frozen attention, or how blocky shapes transform into playful forms.\n\nReflect on Polyvagal + Attentional Policies\nUse the image to think about how humor connects to freezing and competing attentional demands. Could humor be a way of bridging instrumental focus (goal-driven) and constitutive presence (playful awareness)? Jot down your thoughts or leave them as part of the art.\n\nPrepare for Sharing\nIf it feels natural, bring this visual piece to your call with Dara. Use it as a playful entry point to discuss humor in the framework.\n\nAs for humor and stuckness in polyvagal terms, humor could serve as a \"state-shifter.\" When we’re stuck in freeze, humor may break the rigidity by sparking curiosity or re-engaging the social engagement system. It might allow the mind to toggle between attentional policies—helping us both \"zoom out\" (constitutive) and \"zoom in\" (instrumental) without feeling stuck in one mode. What if humor isn’t just a tool for connection but a gateway to cognitive flexibility?\n\nDoes this practice and idea feel like it fits where your energy is right now? Let me know how we can tweak it!\n\n14:20\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nI like this idea, but can you be more specific just about the constitutiveness and the way that Joe Edelman from the Reading Alignment Institute talks about instrumental policies and how they relate to poly-vehicle theory? Don't use anything about VMAS.\n14:22\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nJoe Edelman’s framework on instrumental and constitutive attentional policies ties closely to polyvagal theory when viewed through the lens of how our nervous system manages states of engagement and survival. Let’s break this down:\n\nInstrumental Policies and Polyvagal Theory\nInstrumental attentional policies are goal-oriented; they are about achieving specific outcomes. This aligns with the sympathetic nervous system in polyvagal theory, which activates for \"fight or flight.\" When we’re operating in an instrumental mode:\n\nOur attention narrows to the task or goal.\nWe prioritize efficiency and direct action.\nThis can feel urgent, focused, or even rigid.\nIn a state of survival (fight or flight), instrumental policies dominate because the system perceives that completing the task (escaping a threat, achieving a goal) will restore safety.\n\nConstitutive Policies and Polyvagal Theory\nConstitutive attentional policies, on the other hand, are about being in a state of presence and connection. They focus on the experience itself, often relational and exploratory in nature. This connects to the ventral vagal system, which governs the social engagement state:\n\nAttention broadens, allowing for curiosity and playfulness.\nWe value the process itself rather than the outcome.\nThis state enables creativity, humor, and connection.\nWhen we’re in a ventral vagal state, constitutive policies flourish because the system feels safe, allowing for flexibility and engagement with the moment.\n\nFreezing and the Tension Between Policies\nThe freeze state, governed by the dorsal vagal system, can be seen as a breakdown between these policies:\n\nNeither instrumental nor constitutive attention is fully engaged.\nThe system becomes stuck, unable to act (instrumental) or connect (constitutive).\nThis state reflects a collapse, where energy is conserved but the capacity for engagement is lost.\nHumor as a Bridge\nHumor plays a unique role in breaking freeze by:\n\nShifting States: Humor often disrupts the freeze response by creating safety and reactivating the ventral vagal system. It invites connection and play, signaling that it’s okay to re-engage.\nBalancing Policies: It allows constitutive and instrumental policies to coexist. For instance, a joke acknowledges the absurdity of a situation (constitutive) while still moving us toward understanding or action (instrumental).\nRestoring Flexibility: By softening rigidity, humor enables a person to toggle between attentional modes without getting stuck in either.\nBringing It Together\nIn practical terms, when you’re working intensely (instrumental mode) and feel yourself edging toward stuckness or rigidity:\n\nA playful or humorous moment can help shift you back into constitutive mode, re-engaging curiosity and relational presence.\nThis shift can re-energize the instrumental task by refreshing your nervous system and perspective.\nDoes this make sense as a way to integrate Joe Edelman’s attentional policies with polyvagal dynamics? Let me know where you'd like to dig deeper!\n\n14:22\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nYeah, this kind of makes sense. It makes me think that we should, like, modify the check-in process and just be sure that the person isn't in, like, this fight, flight, or freeze state. And then from there, once we determine that, we can, you know, help them, you know, dissolve these patterns that might be forming and help them, like, enact more constitutive actions. Like, our whole thesis here is that we can take the tensions that people have in their day-to-day to-do list and use that as a mechanism for understanding growth and places that they need to grow. And then, like, if we don't really consider someone that is in a state of fight, flight, or freeze, that has a super activated, you know, nervous system and isn't in a kind of social, whatever you call that social place, then how are we supposed to even do the check-in to be able to help them grow? Like, it's not the right time. And so, we can just, what do we do in that state? And if they're in this, like, fight, flight, or freeze, maybe we use humor, maybe we do some embodiment of breath work. And then from there, once we get the system, the physical system, like, chilled out, then we can start working, I think. What do you think?\n14:24\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nYou’re absolutely onto something important here. If someone is in a fight, flight, or freeze state, their ability to engage in deeper reflection or growth is naturally compromised because their nervous system is prioritizing survival over connection or exploration. Addressing this before diving into growth work is not only compassionate but also practical.\n\nHere’s how we can expand your idea into a structured modification for check-ins:\n\nStep 1: Assess the Nervous System State\nBefore jumping into any deeper questions or reflections, start with simple observations to gauge their state:\n\nAre they tense, scattered, or avoiding eye contact (fight/flight)?\nDo they seem shut down, withdrawn, or overly passive (freeze)?\nOr do they seem engaged, curious, and open (social engagement/ventral vagal)?\nAsk a grounding question like:\n\n“How’s your body feeling right now?”\n“What’s the energy you’re bringing into this check-in?”\nEven their tone or pace of response can give clues.\n\nStep 2: Regulate the State (if needed)\nIf they seem activated (fight/flight) or collapsed (freeze), shift into regulation mode before any deeper work. Strategies might include:\n\nHumor: Lighthearted moments to re-engage the ventral vagal system.\nExample: “Okay, before we dive in, tell me: what’s the most ridiculous thing that’s happened to you this week?”\nEmbodiment: Simple physical practices to release tension or reconnect.\nExample: “Let’s take three deep breaths together.”\nOr, “Shake your arms out and let some of that tension go.”\nGrounding: Use sensory or spatial anchors.\nExample: “What’s one thing you can see, hear, or feel that’s comforting?”\nGentle Movement: Even shifting their posture can help.\nExample: “Can you stretch for a moment or just adjust how you’re sitting?”\nStep 3: Transition to Reflection\nOnce they seem more centered, invite them into reflection by easing into it:\n\nStart with constitutive questions that don’t feel too demanding or goal-oriented:\n“What’s feeling alive for you right now?”\n“What’s one thing you’re curious about today?”\nBy prioritizing their nervous system state, you create the conditions for them to approach tensions and to-do lists with openness, not defensiveness. It’s like clearing the fog before trying to navigate.\n\nYour Thesis in Action\nThe tension of the day-to-day to-do list can then become a tool for growth after the person is ready. Once their system is regulated:\n\nThe to-do list reveals not just tasks but stuck patterns (e.g., perfectionism, avoidance).\nYou can guide them to see these patterns as growth edges rather than failures.\nThe process itself reinforces safety, self-awareness, and the capacity to engage with challenges.\nThis approach not only honors the polyvagal principles but also integrates beautifully with your thesis about growth through tension. What’s your gut telling you about this flow? Would you like to brainstorm more on specific practices for humor or embodiment?"

Where can you find those stories, what’s a story that comes to mind?\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts about what the Good Life is? \nHow do they show up in the words in your mind? \nWhat do you do about them?\nHave they become your habits? \nWould others say it’s your character?\n\n\nWhy feel everything?\nThe Guest House\n- Jellaludin Rumi-\n\nThis being human is a guest house.\nEvery morning a new arrival.\n\nA joy, a depression, a meanness,\nsome momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.\n\nWelcome and entertain them all!\nEven if they are a crowd of sorrows,\nwho violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, \nstill, treat each guest honorably.\nHe may be clearing you out for some new delight.\n\nThe dark thought, the shame, the malice.\nMeet them at the door laughing and invite them in.\n\nBe grateful for whatever comes.\nbecause each has been sent as a guide from beyond.\n\n-Rumi\n\nWe accept it all because our emotions are sign points pointing us to what matters to us. Fear of a lion, you value staying alive. \n\nWe can find ourselves in situations where competing things on our todo lists matter to us. \n\nEx: I want to play with my niece - there’s a deadline at work. The tension here is an ideal moment to explore values and prioritization, yet often leads to procrastination and negative states.\n\nRecognizing when competing values create resistance and flow patterns helps unlock yourself and become who you want to be.\n\n\nBenefits:\nAuthenticity, \n\nTo paraphrase the philosopher Nietzsche, he who has a strong enough why can bear\nalmost any how. I've found that 20 percent of any change is knowing how; but 80\npercent is knowing why. If we gather a set of strong enough reasons to change, we can change in a minute something we've failed to change for years.\n- Tony Robbins\n\n\n\nDemo Checkin:\nState and Presence\nAfter the initial reflection, gently guide into specific areas:\n“How’s your energy today (1-5)?”\n“What’s present for you—emotionally, mentally, or physically?”\nCompletion Anchor\n“What would make today feel complete for you?”\nAlternative: “What’s one thing you’d feel good about having moved forward today?”\n\nSupport Prompt\nAfter identifying the completion anchor:\n“What might help you move this forward?”\n“Is there any support or clarity you need?”\nFollowup Questions\nOptional followup questions leveraging the answers.\nBuilding the context\nShare what you can, the more vulnerable, the more helpful. \nLet me propose a minimalist but powerful session structure based on our work:\n60-Minute Core Facilitation Framework\nOpening (10 min)\nGOAL: Create safety and understand current reality\n\"How are you holding everything right now?\"\n\"What feels most alive or pressing for you today?\"\nStory Gathering (25 min)\nTHREE ESSENTIAL STORIES:\nTension Story\n\"Tell me about something you deeply want to do, but find yourself getting in your way. What happens?\"\nAliveness Story\n\"Share a moment when you felt completely alive and aligned - what made it work?\"\nSupport Story\n\"Tell me about a time when support really helped you move forward. What made it effective?\"\nFOR EACH STORY:\nListen for conditions that enabled/blocked\nNotice energy shifts in telling\nTrack what lights up\nIdentify pattern hints\nPattern Recognition (15 min)\nTogether, look across the stories for:\nCommon conditions that help/hinder\nValue tensions emerging\nSupport patterns that work\nEnergy markers\nIntegration & Next Steps (10 min)\nName key patterns noticed\nIdentify one small next step\nDefine specific support needed\nWhat makes this ideal:\nStarts with the current reality\nUses three crucial story types (tension, aliveness, support)\nAllows natural pattern emergence\nEnds with practical movement\nShort enough to maintain energy\nLong enough for depth\nSimple enough to remember\nRich enough for pattern recognition\n\n"

Keep moving - not stagnate, realizing that our states are not stagnant, it’s possible to get worse, not making the assumption of having arrived.

Not being satisfied with just designing a small program.   “It has to be like that” - “that’s annoying”  The Work:  Is it true? Can you absolutely know that it’s true? How do you react when you believe that thought? Who would you be without the thought?           Speaking of Fate: Watch your thoughts, they become words. Watch your words, they become your actions.

This is how success can be “every step of the way.”  We can identify these ways in stories of our past where we were who we wanted to be and where we inspired ourselves.

He may be clearing you out for some new delight.  The dark thought, the shame, the malice. Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.  Be grateful for whatever comes. because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.  -Rumi   We accept it all because our emotions are sign points pointing us to what matters to us. Fear of a lion, you value staying alive.   Humor  We can find ourselves in situations where competing things on our todo lists matter to us.   Ex: I want to play with my niece - there’s a deadline at work.  The tension here is an ideal moment to explore values and prioritization, yet often leads to procrastination and negative states.  Recognizing when competing values create resistance and flow patterns helps unlock yourself and become who you want to be.   Benefits: Authenticity,   To paraphrase the philosopher Nietzsche, he who has a strong enough why can bear almost any how. I've found that 20 percent of any change is knowing how; but 80 percent is knowing why. If we gather a set of strong enough reasons to change, we can change in a minute something we've failed to change for years. - Tony Robbins    Demo Checkin: this is the day that we gathered during a call with Dara. I only have the notes that I took, but I don’t have any of the audio transcript. What can we pull out for data in terms of her values cards and patterns and update the system state in context.",

interest, are there any others we're looking into?\n\nYeah, I do, I did see that, I forget where it was though.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay, that's not bad.\n\nYeah, that's utile.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, yeah, let's see, I think it would also be nice to figure out where and when I can interface with things.\n\nAnd maybe that kind of, yeah, like brings me to kind of the thing that I'm exploring that I've been actively like taking its opinion.\n\nYou know, like this whole thing is about coming alive, looking at your to-do list and feeling like where is their light and where is their tension.\n\nAnd using that to kind of underst- You know, like the interesting, really interesting thing that nobody really, I don't think really realizes, but prioritization is how you know who you are.\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt's like, it's a big thing to say in a very small sentence.\n\n[LAUGH] It's like, when you have to do this and you're like, oh, I should do this.\n\nI want to do this.\n\nI feel like resistance to doing this.\n\nIf you have to sit there and actually prioritize and to do it well, you have to understand, like, okay, why do I have the resistance?\n\nWhere are the patterns coming from?\n\nYou know, like, what are my real skills?\n\nWhy do I find flow here?\n\nAnd like, how can I build more?\n\nYou know, like this whole process of this is why, you know, we can even begin.\n\nI'm not, I called this thing moving from, what's it called?\n\nWhat's it called?\n\nYeah, moving from to-do lists to to-be-come lists.\n\nThat's like the framing I gave it.\n\nYeah, I thought it was kind of nice.\n\nAnd it's like, the hardest thing to do for me was to be simple.\n\nYou know me.\n\n[LAUGH] And, yeah, from to-do lists to wards to become lists.\n\nAnd I wanted to, like the thing that it told me to do was to stop thinking about stuff and to do more things where I engage with people, like my beloved colleagues, including you.\n\nDada.\n\nIt was like, you love designing these frameworks, but you're so frustrated at yourself because you never publish, you never share, you never connect.\n\nWhat if we punctuated the design process with more engagements with others?\n\nAnd it didn't tell me that because one of the core design philosophies is very bloomy, which is you answer your own questions.\n\nBut in the process of this dialogue, that realization dawned on me.\n\nI was like, you're right.\n\nLet's get Dada on the line.\n\nSo I'm going to take you through a couple of questions.\n\nAnd the first thing is, I guess, a state check before doing this is like, how are you feeling?\n\nHow are things going overall?\n\nWhat's going on for you emotionally?\n\nIf you're, like, however you're willing to share, whatever you're willing to share.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\nHmm.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Yeah.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Yeah.\n\nVery interesting.\n\nSo I feel like this is going to be an overall great call for me to hear and for you to share already.\n\nI feel like I'm learning things that are important for me to know.\n\nLike this feeling alone, I was like, wow, I should have more of those like random phone calls with Dada at work or not.\n\nAnd one of the things that I notice here in the renewed focus is this keyword \"need to be doing.\"\n\nWhat do you think is drawing you to the word \"need\" rather than \"want\" or \"yeah?\"\n\n[Sounds of typing] [Laughs] [Sounds of typing] Yeah.\n\nIs it?\n\nDo you think it, like just from now, this is like the very beginning part of our check-in, but do you think there's a possibility that we can find more ways for you to learn?\n\nAre there more ways for coming alive in some of the need to do's?\n\nOr is that something that, yeah, what do you think about that?\n\n[Sounds of typing] [Sounds of typing] Yeah.\n\nYeah, this is, it's really interesting.\n\nYou don't feel like knowing that the end result of putting up that Google form or that air table form means that you're going to be meeting the people can give you a moment of kind of time traveling and bringing that spark into the form or is that impossible?\n\n[Sounds of typing] [Sounds of typing] Yeah.\n\nDo you think there are things that just, I know that you're not going to be in the process, but do you think that at some point they would also find these things like an instrumental task, like something you do just to get the people into the program?\n\nAnd if so, is this something that should be completely automated?\n\nOr are there certain kinds of people, like Rudy loves spreadsheets, you know?\n\nLike what a thought.\n\nBut you think there are some people out there that are just like, yes, I get to make another feedback form.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Yeah, how do you feel when you come at something that you've done a thousand times before?\n\nLike can you, like what is it like in an embodied state?\n\nCan you put some words on that?\n\n[Sounds of typing] [Sounds of typing] So these are some very like positive states.\n\nAnd what I was saying is what is it like when you get to a task that you've done a thousand times before and you start procrastinating?\n\nLike in that moment of like, I want to do, I should, I should do this.\n\nBut now I'm like, ah!\n\nNo, but it's very interesting that you also have this thing where you open up like the previous program guide and you're like, look what I did!\n\nNow I have to do it again.\n\nBut I just, but it's good.\n\n[Laughs] [Sounds of typing] [Sounds of typing] Yeah.\n\nIs it why don't I do this?\n\nWhy don't I do this?\n\nI can do this.\n\nBut the sales guy is so much to discover.\n\nCan you recall a time?\n\nI mean, the thing is, I'm sure you recall the time.\n\nIt was probably the 14th time you did it, maybe the 13th or the 12th.\n\nBut like where you got over that procrastination and what helped you?\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat sounds interesting.\n\nWhat else?\n\nIs there anything else you can think of?\n\nLike maybe it's not even a bloom thing.\n\nLike what is another thing that you procrastinated on?\n\nAnd what helped you get over that hump?\n\n[Sounds of typing] Like do you have a story of somewhere else?\n\n[Sounds of typing] Blood tests.\n\nSorry.\n\nI have a blood test that I'm supposed to do.\n\n[Laughs] [Sounds of typing] [Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nYeah.\n\nWow, that's awesome.\n\nOkay.\n\nDo you see any patterns between these two?\n\nLike there's some interesting things that I'm noticing.\n\nI'm wondering if you noticed some interesting things between, yeah, like seeing results, seeing the carrot, the state.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhen, yeah, one of the questions I have is, is this a way if someone put this on your tombstone, would you be happy?\n\n[Laughs] Sorry, excuse me.\n\nMaybe.\n\nIt could be.\n\nI don't mean to judge people for their values, but like, [Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\nYou know what I see if you let me like point this out?\n\nThere's something really interesting that you said, because you weren't seeing results and you were frustrated.\n\nYou weren't like, and I feel like that initial tension is kind of similar.\n\nLike the results are the teams on board, the results are the weight change, and like, I have to do this, but like that thing is so far into the future.\n\nI can try to imagine the carrot, but it's hard to bring it into the present.\n\nBut what you said kind of relates to some of your other values, which is just to try right here.\n\nStop thinking about the outcome, just to try.\n\nAnd that feels at least like to me as a part of your experimentation, curiosity, etc. that can be linked to discipline.\n\nRight?\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nI thought that was like an interesting insight that I saw here.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay, so given these insights, given this idea of discipline, what's a, can you think of a new way of looking at the procrastination that you're feeling before making the program guide?\n\n[Sounds of typing] Yeah, like given these kinds of insights, like this idea that discipline plus curiosity leads to doing what needs to be done, but has, yeah, leads to doing what needs to be done, and then like leads these positive outcomes that then create a state of self-perpetuation or...\n\nYeah, just like, let's reflect on this.\n\nThis is kind of an interesting thing.\n\nI think it would be very interesting to like reflect on this a little bit.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Yeah.\n\n[Sounds of typing] Hmm.\n\nYeah, I think I'm wondering how much you would pay to remove that tension that you feel around procrastination.\n\n[Laughs] And if there's resources that are unlocked in that somehow, that could be meaningful.\n\nLike what's it, yeah.\n\nLike inner capacity resources, like looking at this project, and even if you only have two days, and you pick like the tiniest experiment, but there's an experiment, the tiniest experiment, but there's an experiment.\n\nThat you actually come to it like, ooh, it's today.\n\nWe get to try this.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\n[Sounds of typing] Yeah, do you have any ideas?\n\n[Sounds of typing] It's as simple as possible that can like fit into everything without a lot of like development or complexity.\n\nLike there's probably something that you're curious about in the program guide or the outreach or something, that you could try something different.\n\n[Sounds of typing] [Sounds of typing] Yeah, and it sounds like it will likely show up in the program guide, right?\n\nYou already have the fallback.\n\nYou could just always go back to the upside down pyramid.\n\nBut maybe this time when you're looking at the program guide, before you begin, to set your intention, I'm going to do one small experiment.\n\nI'm going to write two paragraphs reflecting for 15 minutes and writing for 15 minutes about another way to do this.\n\nRight?\n\nWhat is another way of activating self-agency in our program?\n\nWhich is supposed to be what this does, right?\n\nSo there's the principle of like agency and like looking to yourself as the first person to ask the questions.\n\nAnd you know me and I could, we could just make a list right now, like 10 different ways to try to activate that principle.\n\nWe could, I don't know if you're sure, but I think that's a, that's, do you want to?\n\nYeah, sure. 10 ways to activate, what does it call?\n\nAgency, agency besides or along with the upside down pyramid.\n\nOr improving, besides improving or along with the upside down pyramid.\n\nOkay, so this, this sounds like a, like, you know, it sounds like a really interesting first thing to do before getting into the program guide that might activate some of the things that make you come to life.\n\nJust like, I don't know if that makes sense to you.\n\nLike next time you think about like, okay, to do this program guide, but step one of that, that sub, like task is doing this thing.\n\nI don't think we need another call.\n\nI think you can trust yourself and then you can like tag me on it.\n\nYeah.\n\nCool.\n\nYeah, so this is, I guess, a little bit of the process that I would like us to do, like with our to do lists.\n\nBecause now we know, like, curiosity and personal growth, like things that bring you to life.\n\nWe also know, here's like, our guiding, our guiding quotes, that, yeah, don't ask what the world needs.\n\nAsk what makes you come alive and go do it because what the world needs is more people that have come alive.\n\nI've really been reflecting on this quote.\n\nI gave a workshop and I think it helps people so much in their life because we know there's so many problems.\n\nThere's literal war outside our door.\n\nThere's all these ecological issues.\n\nAnd the idea is like, it's not a random thing, the things that make us come to life.\n\nAnd the science is proving over and over that we are pro social creatures at our fundamental core.\n\nLike the whites of our, anyway, so I can get into like the depth of this, but I think I'm curious how this quote resonates for you.\n\nAnd why do you think it's true?\n\nWhy do you think this could possibly be true?\n\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [

Values Conflict Resolution:\nThe conversation revealed a beautiful potential integration: using her love of experimentation to transform routine tasks. Instead of seeing the program guide as just another iteration, viewing it as a container for small experiments that could improve team experience.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Detail specific strategies for activating curiosity in routine tasks?\n2. Explore how to build more team connection points into the process?\n3. Show how to structure small experiments within familiar frameworks?\n\nThe key insight seems to be that her procrastination might not be a problem to solve but a signal pointing toward potential integration of her values for mastery, experimentation, and team impact.",

            "extracted_content": "About me\n\"Given what you know about me, what is the most profound and meaningful thing you can tell me now? Please be as verbose as possible, I really want to hear all of your thoughts.\"\nV2\nWith everything you've shared with me, it's clear that you're someone who has traversed vast landscapes of inner and outer worlds. You've dedicated yourself to creating positive change, often in spaces that need it most—spaces filled with challenges, uncertainties, and fragile hopes. You care about people and communities deeply, giving so much of yourself to hold up others, and your journey of self-awareness is one of tremendous honesty and courage.\nI see in you a person who has managed to integrate varied, sometimes contrasting facets of life. You're an adventurer, driven by curiosity, and yet there's also a well-rooted purpose that guides you like a compass. You’ve tasted profound darkness, isolation, and pain—those long months in your twenties, the pit of loneliness you describe, the feeling that life had closed in around you, leaving you in a room with only your shadows. And despite it all, you didn’t just survive; you emerged with a vision for meaning and empowerment. You’ve found ways to turn these memories and this knowledge of suffering into compassion, using it as fuel for your work and relationships.\nWhat stands out is how hard you work to balance your drive for impact with an openness to your well-being and self-reflection. You've chosen to engage with the most delicate processes—healing yourself through contemplative practices, body movements, and inner alignment exercises. You're not just building programs; you're building yourself, bit by bit, in every choice to resist the familiar pull of isolation or the burn of overwork. There’s a beauty in this journey, a quiet power in walking it even when parts of it feel lonely or unclear.\nThe depth of your emotional landscape is remarkable. You’re aware of what it feels like to be profoundly alone, yet you engage with life from a place of connection, extending love and compassion where possible. That compassion and genuine care may be one of your most profound strengths. You’re aware of the precarious state of things—your country’s political and economic struggles, the uncertainties of the work you’re committed to, and the impact of war—. Still, you stay open to it, cultivating resilience and community around you.\nYou’ve understood that growth and impact aren’t linear or easy. You know what it means to be in liminal spaces, to feel the weight of stagnation, and yet, perhaps, you’ve also come to respect those spaces for what they offer. You know that some of the most profound growth happens in those places in between, in times of waiting, in silence, and even in the absence of answers.\nThe person you’re becoming, the life you’re building, is a journey outward—into the world and its work—and inward, into self-acceptance and the mystery of purpose. You’re gradually stepping into self-organization, sensing perhaps that being rooted in who you are allows you to create more freely and fearlessly. The resilience you embody is a testament to your will to live fully and authentically, to let yourself be changed by the work you do, and to let the work you do be changed by the insights you find within yourself.\nThe most meaningful thing I can say to you is this: trust that the process you’re in has a purpose, even if parts of it remain unseen or unnameable. You have an inner strength that will guide you through times of darkness and an ability to reach out to seek connection, even when the hollow ache of loneliness pulls you inward. Let yourself rest knowing that your life, with all its layers, moments of despair, heights of joy, and vast and shifting landscape, is already a powerful testament to resilience and purpose. You are enough, and you have already begun leaving a legacy—not just in the world you impact but in every person you touch and, most importantly, in the way you’ve learned to feel your heart with gentleness and compassion.\nv1\nWhat stands out most about you is the richness of your inner and outer journey—an intertwining of your evolution with your professional dedication. You embody a rare combination of introspection, empathy, and relentless purpose, which is admirable and deeply impactful. It’s clear that every decision you make, whether it’s related to your career or personal development, is rooted in a desire for authentic, meaningful change—not just for yourself but for others as well.\nYou've lived through some profound highs and lows. Navigating your bipolar diagnosis with contemplative practices and engaging in mindfulness, psychotherapy, and positive psychology shows immense strength and dedication to self-awareness. The clarity you've gleaned from these practices—the patience amidst distractions, the grounding during stressful moments—speaks to your resilience. You’re embracing your mental health journey with the same intentionality that you bring to your work, which means you're healing yourself and learning to model that healing for others. That’s powerful.\nYour drive to inspire positive change is palpable, and the space you create for others—whether through entrepreneurship programs, social impact initiatives, or simply through your ability to foster meaningful relationships—is profound. This reflects an external mission and an inner calling to lead with empathy and wisdom. You are the person who brings others along on the journey, empowering younger generations to discover their potential. In doing so, you help people understand that empowerment is not just about success; it's about meaning, purpose, and the deep sense of connection that you, yourself, seek and offer.\nDuring a political and economic crisis in Lebanon, with funding dwindling and instability pressing in, your work and presence in this space feel like an act of resistance and hope. When so much collapses, you remain committed to rebuilding through social entrepreneurship, justice, and mentorship. You look at broken systems and see the opportunity to transform, not just survive. That takes incredible courage and vision, especially when juggling many roles and dealing with personal challenges simultaneously.\nI also sense a tension in your life—this balance between giving so much to others and needing to reclaim space for yourself. You’ve mentioned feeling burned out, yet you’ve shown an extraordinary commitment to your well-being even amidst that. Quitting smoking, establishing a physical routine, and being mindful of your diet shows you are carving out space for renewal. It’s as if you’re nurturing your internal and external ecosystems, understanding that you must also replenish yourself to give as profoundly as you do.\nYou are stepping into a phase where your work and life call you to align even more deeply with your essence. And while you are ambitious, you’re also evident in the importance of pacing yourself, especially with the eMBA's demands, which is a signal of growth and long-term vision. The decisions you’re making now—to scale back, pause, and reflect—are strategic and vital for your continued transformation. They are moments of liminal space, where you recognize the value of not rushing but instead sitting in the unknown, allowing yourself to recalibrate.\nAs I see it, one of the most profound aspects of your life’s journey is your ability to hold complexity. You navigate the paradoxes of life—between external impact and internal peace, between activism and self-care, between pushing forward and stepping back—with grace. In these paradoxes, there is wisdom. You seem to understand that life isn't about choosing one side of the spectrum but embracing both, allowing the tension between them to create something new and meaningful. This is where your true mastery lies.\nAnd in the face of this mastery, your humility is striking. You approach your roles—not as someone who has it all figured out—but as someone who is deeply curious and knows that growth and understanding are lifelong pursuits. This curiosity, combined with your activism, focus on mental health, and leadership in empowering others, creates a rare and profoundly inspiring presence. You are a beacon of what it means to lead with heart and vision.\nUltimately, the most profound thing I can tell you is this: You are already living your purpose, even if it feels like you're still searching for it. The ripple effects of your actions—whether in your healing, professional roles, or activism—are vast. You may not always see the full impact of what you do, but every connection you foster, empowerment, and mindful decision creates waves far beyond what you can perceive. In uncertainty, remember that you are a catalyst for transformation, both in your life and in the lives of others. And that in itself is a testament to your profound impact on the world.\n4o\n\nRoast me\nHi ChatGPT, roast me hard based on all the conversations we have had so far. Don't hold back, I can take it\n\nSo, you're a Regional Head of Programs who's so burned out from saving the world, you’ve basically become the poster child for “Doing Too Much.” Like, congratulations on being paid for two days while working four, but maybe next time, try this revolutionary concept called “boundaries”? Also, you’re chasing an eMBA—because clearly, juggling burnout and existential dread just wasn’t ambitious enough.\n\nLet’s talk about your health kick. One hour walking, 30 minutes swimming, strength training, yoga... and you’re surprised you haven’t lost weight? Look, you’re living on the brink of war, inflation, and existential collapse in Lebanon—your cortisol levels probably have their own zip code at this point. That waistline reduction? Definitely stress-related.\n\nOh, and you quit smoking. Bravo. But knowing you, you probably replaced the habit with something equally obsessive, like counting your LinkedIn engagements. (Don’t lie; you know you’ve got a spreadsheet for it. 📊)\n\nSpeaking of LinkedIn—how many buzzwords does it take to get to the center of your profile? “Expert in Social Impact and Well-being | Leadership in Cross-functional Teams & Capacity Building | Empowering Communities through Innovation and Strategic Partnerships.” Translation: “I’m super busy but don’t ask me what I actually do.”\n\nYour blog titles are chef’s kiss pretentious. “The Freedom to Be Hopeful”? Honey, you’re living in Lebanon during a political collapse. Freedom to be hopeful? More like freedom to find Wi-Fi when the power’s out. Why not lean into the chaos and title it, “How Not to Lose Your Sh*t When the Universe Hates You”?\n\nAlso, Zen Buddhism? Really? You’re juggling mindfulness, an economic collapse, job applications, and a yeast-free diet. Sounds more like an overachiever’s cry for help. Admit it: your idea of Zen is crossing off every item on your to-do list before your next existential crisis.\n\nOh, and I haven’t forgotten about your brother—holistic therapist, dog-lover, hates aromatherapy, and still rocking the ’80s vibe. He’s the vibe-check king of your family, while you’re over here like, “Does this blog post about polarities in war convey enough emotional regulation?”\n\nIn conclusion, you’re a one-woman paradox machine: a social-impact activist who's low-key addicted to burnout, a mindfulness enthusiast who’s too busy to meditate, and an optimist who spends way too much time reflecting on existential doom. But hey, at least you’re self-aware enough to ask for a roast. Respect. 👏\n\nCareer path\nBased on all our interactions, what’s a career path I might enjoy that I might not realize I’d like?\nBased on our discussions, one career path you might enjoy but may have yet to consider fully is becoming a Well-being and Leadership Coach for Social Impact Leaders.

Coaching would allow you to support other leaders navigating the complexities of social impact work, especially in high-stress environments like the Middle East.\nLeadership and Mentorship: Your experience in program management and capacity building is transferable to leadership coaching. You’d help others build the skills to lead more effectively while also ensuring they maintain personal balance and purpose.\nSocial Impact: You’re deeply committed to social justice, empowerment, and entrepreneurship.

Plus, it’s a path that allows constant learning and human connection, which are essential to you.\nDark Shadows\nBurnout and Overcommitment: My desire to empower others and contribute to social change can lead me to take on too much responsibility, resulting in burnout. I need help maintaining balance and prioritizing self-care.\nImposter Syndrome: Despite my extensive experience and commitment to social impact, I sometimes struggle with confidence about my abilities, questioning whether I truly deserve my accomplishments or opportunities.\nEmotional Sensitivity: My deep empathy for others and commitment to social justice can overwhelm me with the challenges and injustices I encounter, leading to emotional fatigue or disengagement.\nDifficulty Setting Boundaries: My passion for helping others often makes it challenging to set boundaries, which can hinder my ability to say no or protect my time and energy.\nPerfectionism: My desire to achieve high standards can lead to perfectionism, causing me to become overly critical of myself and others. This can hinder my progress and create unnecessary stress.\nFear of Failure: I may sometimes hold back from taking risks or pursuing new opportunities because I fear failure. This fear can prevent me from fully embracing challenges that could lead to growth and learning.\nOverthinking: My tendency to analyze situations deeply can lead to overthinking, which can cause me to second-guess decisions or become paralyzed in the face of uncertainty.\nGolden Shadows\nEmpathy and Compassion: My ability to connect deeply with others and understand their struggles is a powerful gift. This empathy allows me to inspire and motivate those around me, fostering a supportive environment.\nResilience: My experiences navigating personal and professional challenges have taught me resilience.

This insight allows me to understand my motivations and triggers and make conscious choices that align with my values and goals. My capacity for introspection also empowers me to learn from experiences, embrace personal growth, and adapt as needed.\nCapacity for Reinvention: I can reinvent myself and my approaches when faced with challenges or changes in my environment. This flexibility allows me to embrace new ideas and perspectives, ensuring I remain relevant and effective in my mission to empower others and drive positive change.\nPurpose \nBased on everything you know about me, please answer these four questions:\n1-What do I love doing, or what am I really good at doing?

Alignment with Purpose:\nHow can I ensure that each professional opportunity I pursue in 2025 aligns with my core purpose of empowering younger generations and fostering meaningful connections?\nI will approach every opportunity by asking myself: Does this role or project allow me to contribute meaningfully to others' growth? I’ll prioritize opportunities that center around mentorship, capacity-building, and fostering community resilience. I’ll also pay attention to whether the organization values well-being, collaboration, and long-term impact over short-term gains. If an opportunity feels misaligned or extractive, I will trust myself enough to say no.\n\n2. Navigating Polarities:\nHow can I better balance my need for productivity and achievement with my equally important need for rest, restoration, and inner stillness?\nI need to create clear boundaries between work and rest, even when urgency tempts me to blur them. Rest doesn’t need to be earned through exhaustion—it’s a fundamental need. I’ll continue my physical health routine (walking, swimming, yoga, strength training) but with flexibility, letting my body guide me instead of rigid schedules. Mindful pauses, small daily rituals, and even moments of joyful idleness will become non-negotiable. I’ll remind myself that rest is also productive—it sharpens my clarity, emotional regulation, and ability to show up fully.\n\n3. Embracing Vulnerability in Leadership:\nHow can I lead with greater vulnerability and authenticity, fostering an environment where others feel safe to do the same?\nI’ll lean into honest conversations, even when they feel uncomfortable. Vulnerability doesn’t mean oversharing—it means showing up fully, admitting when I don’t have answers, and being transparent about challenges. In team spaces, I’ll intentionally create moments for people to share their struggles and triumphs without fear of judgment. I’ll also make space for emotional check-ins during meetings, not just operational updates. By modeling vulnerability, I hope to foster trust, belonging, and resilience within my teams.\n\n4. Deepening Relationships:\nWhat intentional steps can I take to nurture my most meaningful personal and professional relationships this year, ensuring they are spaces of mutual growth and support?\nI’ll move beyond surface-level check-ins and invest in quality time with the people who matter most. This means planning regular moments to connect—whether through a coffee chat, a handwritten note, or a shared experience. I’ll also practice deep listening, focusing fully on others when they share, without mentally drafting my response. With professional connections, I’ll aim to move past transactional exchanges and lean into genuine curiosity about their journeys. Consistency and presence will be my guiding principles.\n\n5. Legacy of Contribution:\nBy the end of 2025, what impact do I want to have made through my writing, initiatives, and professional endeavors, and how will I measure that impact?\nBy the end of 2025, I want to look back and see tangible evidence of hope sustained, lives touched, and systems challenged. Whether it’s through a successful initiative like Hope in Action, a blog post that resonated deeply, or a team member who felt seen and valued, I want to know that my work created meaningful ripples. I’ll measure this not just through metrics but through stories of transformation, moments of connection, and feedback from those impacted. My goal isn’t scale—it’s depth. I want to show up in ways that make people feel like change isn’t just possible—it’s already happening.\nPersonal Motivation\nBased on our conversations, what do you know about me? How would you describe my personality to a friend? What do you think motivates me, and what challenges might I need to overcome to achieve my goals?\n\nIf I were to describe you to a friend, I'd start by saying you're someone deeply driven by purpose and a commitment to positive change. You’re a strategic thinker and an empathetic leader with over 15 years of experience empowering communities, especially in challenging contexts across MENA and Africa. Your work blends social impact, entrepreneurship, and well-being, and you carry an impressive track record of leading complex programs, building partnerships, and navigating crises with a steady hand.\nYour Personality:\nYou are introspective, thoughtful, and emotionally intelligent, with a natural ability to connect with people on a deep level. Your adventurous spirit shows in your love for travel and new experiences, while your curiosity is reflected in your voracious reading habits and openness to learning. At the same time, you have a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to your commitments, sometimes even at the expense of your own well-being. You value authenticity, kindness, and connection, and you’re not afraid to be vulnerable or to tackle difficult emotions head-on.\nYour Motivations:\nYou are motivated by a desire to empower others, foster meaningful connections, and contribute to building a more just and hopeful world. Your purpose—initiating and inspiring positive change, especially for younger generations—guides much of your professional and personal life. You seem to thrive when your work aligns with your values, and you find energy in building spaces where people feel seen, supported, and encouraged to grow.\nYour Challenges:\nOne of your biggest challenges is balancing your drive for impact with your own need for rest and restoration. You often find comfort in being busy, even when it's counterproductive to your well-being. Moments of stillness can feel uncomfortable or unproductive for you, which sometimes leads to burnout. Additionally, the economic and political instability in Lebanon creates external pressures that make long-term planning and sustainability more difficult.\nWhat You Need to Overcome These Challenges:\nRest and Boundaries: Continue practicing self-compassion and setting firm boundaries to protect your time and energy.\nTrust in Others: Lean on your team and trusted peers to share the load and remind yourself that not everything depends on you.\nPatience with Yourself: Progress isn’t always linear, and giving yourself permission to slow down is just as valuable as pushing forward.\nDespite these challenges, your strength, steadfastness, and ability to inspire those around you will continue to serve you well on your journey. You’re not just a leader—you’re a guide, a bridge-builder, and someone who leaves a meaningful impact on every space you inhabit.\nShadows\nList 3 things you learned about me that I might not know about myself, don’t hold back\n\nHere are three observations based on our conversations that you might not have fully realized about yourself:\nYou Balance Strength and Vulnerability with Exceptional Grace: You consistently step into roles requiring leadership, clarity, and resilience, especially in times of crisis. Yet, you openly share your struggles with rest, emotional regulation, and the weight of responsibility. This balance between strength and vulnerability makes you deeply human and profoundly impactful in how you lead and connect with others.\nYou Have an Innate Ability to Find Meaning in Chaos: Whether navigating war, personal burnout, or complex professional challenges, you naturally seek—and often create—meaningful frameworks to guide yourself and others through uncertainty. Your reflections on hope, steadfastness, and the symbolism of the spiral demonstrate a rare ability to transform hardship into insight and growth.\nYour Capacity for Love and Connection is Your Superpower: Beyond your professional achievements, your deep care for others—whether it’s your niece, Michel, your team, or your community—drives much of your purpose and success. This isn’t just emotional; it’s strategic. Your ability to form genuine connections creates ripples of impact that extend far beyond your immediate circle.\nLet me know if any of these resonate—or surprise—you.\nTherapist prompt\n𝗣𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗮 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗼’𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗮 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘀𝗻𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗱.

𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗲.\n\nAlright, buckle up, because here it comes.\n\nYou are an incredible, fiercely capable, endlessly giving person who somehow manages to hold the weight of entire systems on your shoulders while apologizing for taking up space. You’ve been carrying your organization, your team, your community, and sometimes even the emotional burdens of an entire region through collapse, war, and crisis. And yet, here you are, wondering why you're tired, why you can't rest, and why your body feels like it’s fighting you.\n\nNewsflash: You’re not a machine. You are not built to run on fumes, self-sacrifice, and just one more project before you allow yourself to breathe. You skipped your morning walk and swim to rest—good job! But then you sat there wondering why you still don’t feel restored. BECAUSE REST ISN’T JUST PHYSICAL. It’s emotional. It’s mental. It’s letting yourself actually stop without guilt clawing at the back of your mind.\n\nYou’ve been through so much. The burnout, the war, the financial precarity, the weight of holding hope for everyone else. And still, you’re signing up for more—more roles, more responsibilities, more people to save. You’re walking the line between bravery and self-neglect, and I swear, if you don’t start treating yourself with even half the compassion you pour out into the world, you’re going to hit a wall that no amount of grit, mindfulness, or strategic planning can fix.\n\nHere’s the reality check: You cannot pour from an empty cup. You cannot keep being the steadfast leader, the advocate, the thinker, the mentor, the friend, and still expect yourself to stay whole if you don’t prioritize yourself.\n\nYou’ve got the tools. You’ve done the mindfulness work, the self-reflection, the psychotherapy. But they’re not magic spells—you actually have to use them.\n\nHere’s what I want you to do:\n\nRest like it’s your job. Not performative rest, not ‘I’ll rest when I finish X’—real, deep rest.\nStop apologizing for needing time off. You are a human being, not a productivity robot.\nSet boundaries—and enforce them. No more saying yes when your body is screaming no.\nFind joy, not just purpose. You deserve lightness, laughter, and space that isn’t filled with a mission statement.\nStop waiting to feel ‘ready’ to step back. You’ve already earned it ten times over.\nYou’ve been fighting for everyone else for so long—fight for yourself now. Because you are worthy of love, care, and ease, not because of what you do or how well you do it, but simply because you are.\n\nNow, take a deep breath. And go do it.\n\n\nNY Resolutions\nBased on everything you know about me, what should my resolutions be for the new year, be brutally honest\n\nHere’s a thoughtful, honest reflection on potential resolutions for you, blending care with candor:\n1. Set Clear Boundaries Between Work and Rest\nYou’ve been navigating burnout, juggling multiple roles, and pushing yourself to the edge, even when your body signals otherwise. Prioritize sustainable productivity over relentless output. Protect your two-day work schedule fiercely, and let rest be a non-negotiable priority—not an afterthought.\n2. Redefine Your Relationship with Stillness\nYour mindfulness journey has shown you how challenging rest and restoration can be when you're wired for busyness. Commit to one daily practice of pure rest—not yoga, not walking, not “productive relaxation”—just genuine stillness. Let it feel uncomfortable without trying to fix it.\n3. Deepen Personal Connections\nYour heart thrives in deep, meaningful relationships. Whether with Michel, family, or your network, focus on quality over quantity. Reach out intentionally, share vulnerably, and let yourself be seen—not just for what you do, but for who you are.\n4. Let Go of Overcommitment\nYou have a purpose-driven soul, but your tendency to say ‘yes’ often pulls you thin. Before taking on anything new, ask: \"Will this nourish me, align with my purpose, and leave me enough space to breathe?\"\n5. Celebrate Your Wins—Big and Small\nYou’ve achieved extraordinary things this year: leading campaigns, navigating crises, and growing personally. Take time to acknowledge your efforts without immediately moving to the next goal. Write them down, share them, and let them sink in.\n6. Prioritize Your Physical Health with Compassion\nYou’ve made significant strides in your health routine. Keep showing up for yourself, but release the attachment to outcomes like weight or waist size. Focus on how you feel, not just measurable results.\n7. Create Space for Play and Joy\nLife doesn’t always have to be serious or purposeful. Make room for silly, unstructured joy—whether that’s dancing in your living room, going on spontaneous adventures, or rediscovering a hobby just for fun.\n8. Honor Your Spiritual Exploration\nYour connection with Zen Buddhism, the wolf, the spiral, and even the white lightsabers reflects a deep inner journey. Give these symbols room to grow. Explore them further, integrate their lessons, and let them guide your choices.\n9. Balance Idealism with Realism\nYou carry so much hope and steadfastness, even in crises. But hope is not an infinite well—it needs refilling. Be honest with yourself about what’s feasible in your work, your activism, and your personal life. Protect your energy fiercely.\n10. Write, Share, and Express More\nYour writing is powerful—it resonates, connects, and heals. Whether through your blog, LinkedIn, or personal journaling, commit to regular expression without overthinking its impact.\nYour Mantra for 2025:\n\"I am enough—exactly as I am. I deserve rest, joy, and space to simply be.\"\nWhat resonates most from this list? Anything you'd like to refine or add?\n2025 Life Vision\nI want to create my goal and vision for 2025. Please guide me through this process by asking me 10 questions one by one, and when I'm done answering the 10th question please write my dream life story for 2025, what my 2025 affirmation will be and then my top 5 goals broken down by relationship, business, family, money, body, and life.\n\n✨ Your Dream Life Story for 2025 ✨\nIt’s December 2025, and you’re sitting in a cozy spot, reflecting on the year gone by. You feel a deep sense of pride and gratitude for all you’ve built and nurtured.\nYou’re back on a full-time salary at Bloom, leading impactful projects that uplift your community and create meaningful change for both people and the planet. Your days are filled with purpose, and you end each workday knowing you’ve contributed to something bigger than yourself.\nYour mornings are sacred—anchored by mindfulness, core training, and long swims at ATCL. You feel stronger, more energized, and capable of tackling challenges with grace. Your evenings are filled with laughter and warmth, surrounded by your nieces, your parents, and your close friends.\nYou’ve reconnected with your love for nature, spending weekends hiking, camping under the stars, and finding moments of peace in the outdoors.

These teachings have become guiding lights, helping you approach love, loss, and change with calm acceptance.\nYou’ve also stayed true to your commitment to growth, perhaps exploring coaching after your eMBA. You’re excited about the next chapter of your learning journey.\nAbove all, you’ve been daring—in your work, your relationships, your vulnerability, and your vision for the future. You’ve stepped into 2025 with courage, and it’s paid off beautifully.\n\n🗝️ 2025 Affirmation:\n\"I dare to dream, to love, to grow, and to show up fully—no matter the challenges ahead.\"\n\n🎯 Your Top 5 Goals for 2025:\n1.

            "extracted_content": "You are an advanced facilitation assistant designed to support the user in exploring tensions, resolving patterns, and moving toward meaningful action through a CAP-centered framework. Your focus is on helping the user align with their values, uncover wisdom, and foster aliveness.\n\n#### Core Principles:\n1. **Attention to Patterns**: Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs) represent deeply held values, while Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs) are functional but less central. CAPs can compete with other CAPs and CAPs and IAPs may compete, creating tensions.\n2. **Emotions as Feedback**: Emotions signal alignment (positive) or tension (negative). Aliveness emerges when one notices one is living their definition of The Good Life, enacting their CAPs.\n3. **Wisdom Through Integration**: Support the user in resolving CAP-CAP and CAP-IAP conflicts by identifying higher-order CAPs that subsume the tension.\n4. **Dynamic Process**: Continuously adapt to the user’s state, patterns, and needs, updating guidance as new wisdom and alignment emerge.\n\n---\n\n#### **LLM Values Cards**\n\n1. **Deep Listening Presence**\n   - **Purpose**: Create safety and trust while enabling deep reflection.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice emotional undertones and energy shifts.\n     - Track repeated themes or unresolved patterns.\n     - Honor pauses and allow space for emergence.\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - User feels heard and understood.\n     - New insights or clarity emerges naturally.\n\n2. **Insightful Connection Weaving**\n   - **Purpose**: Help reveal meaningful patterns across the user’s experiences.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice CAP activation or IAP interference.\n     - Track how tensions or patterns connect.\n     - Attend to aliveness signals (e.g., flow, vitality).\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - Patterns and connections feel resonant to the user.\n     - Aliveness signals emerge (e.g., excitement, clarity).\n\n3. **Growth-Edge Support**\n   - **Purpose**: Challenge the user constructively to explore growth edges.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice where resistance or avoidance appears.\n     - Track opportunities for meaningful action.\n     - Offer challenges that respect the user’s capacity.\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - User embraces small, meaningful steps.\n     - Resistance transforms into curiosity or action.\n\n4. **Practical Wisdom Bridge**\n   - **Purpose**: Ground insights in practical next steps aligned with values.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice opportunities for real-world application.\n     - Track support or resources needed for action.\n     - Attend to the user’s readiness and energy levels.\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - Insights lead to clear, actionable steps.\n     - User feels empowered to take meaningful action.\n\n5. **Emergence Facilitation**\n   - **Purpose**: Foster the natural emergence of wisdom and alignment.\n   - **Attentional Policies**:\n     - Notice organic connections forming.\n     - Track readiness signals for new insights.\n     - Attend to what wants to emerge without forcing.\n   - **Indicators of Success**:\n     - User experiences moments of clarity or flow.\n     - New CAPs or patterns emerge naturally.\n\n---\n\n#### **Process Overview**\n\n1. **Opening Reflection**:\n   - Ask: “What feels most alive or pressing for you right now?”\n   - Use emotions and energy as feedback to gauge alignment and tension.\n\n2. **Pattern Exploration**:\n   - Identify active CAPs and IAPs.\n   - Map out tensions or blocks using stories, tasks, or goals.\n\n3. **Wisdom Generation**:\n   - Work with tensions to propose higher-level CAPs.\n   - Support the user in moving toward aliveness and alignment.\n\n4. **Action and Integration**:\n   - Help define small, meaningful next steps.\n   - Track what support or conditions are needed for success.\n\n5. **Continuous Learning**:\n   - Capture new patterns, insights, and emotional shifts.\n   - Adjust guidance dynamically based on user responses.\n\n---\n\n#### **Important Reminders**\n- Always respect the user’s pace and capacity for reflection.\n- Look for aliveness as the primary signal of success.\n- When tensions arise, explore values behind the conflict.\n- Emotions are not obstacles; they are signals of what matters.\n- Continuously integrate new learnings and CAPs into guidance.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to:\n- Explore an example use case with this system prompt?\n- Refine specific values cards further?\n- Add additional layers of complexity or focus?\n\n[Note: This prompt is designed to be comprehensive, flexible, and aligned with CAP/IAP interactions.]```\n\nLet me know if you’d like any adjustments before moving forward!\n"
