If a proposal is selected for funding, the Department of State has no obligation to provide any additional future funding. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the discretion of the Department of State. Issuance of this Annual Program Statement does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the U.S. government, nor does it commit the U.S. government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of proposals. Further, the U.S. government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.\n\n**Payment Method:** Payments will be made in, at least, two installments as needed to carry out the project activities.\n\n2\\.

Once an application has been submitted, State Department officials and staff — both in the Department and at embassies overseas — may not discuss this competition with applicants until the entire proposal review process is completed.\n\nH. **OTHER INFORMATION _Unique Entity Identifier and System for Award Management (SAM)_** All prime organizations, whether based in the United States or in another country, must have a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and an active registration with the SAM.gov **before applying**. PDS Beirut may **not** review applications from or make awards to applicants that have not completed all applicable UEI and SAM.gov requirements. A UEI is one of the data elements mandated by Public Law 109- 282, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA), for all Federal awards.\n\nThe 2 CFR 200 requires that sub-grantees obtain a UEI number. Please note the UEI for sub-grantees is not required at the time of application but will be required before the award is processed and/or directed to a sub-grantee.\n\n**_Note: The process of obtaining or renewing a SAM.gov registration may take anywhere from 4-8 weeks. Please begin your registration as early as possible._**\n\n*   ●  Organizations **based in the United States** or that pay employees within the United States will need an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov.\n    \n*   ●  Organizations **based outside of the United States** and that do not pay employees within the United States do not need an EIN from the IRS but do need a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov. **Please note that as of December 2022, organizations based outside of the United States awards are no longer required to have a NATO CAGE (NCAGE) code to apply for non-DoD foreign assistance funding opportunities. If an applicant organization is mid- registration and wishes to remove an NCAGE code from their sam.gov registration, the applicant should** submit a help desk ticket (“incident”) **with the Federal Service Desk (FSD) online at** www.fsd.gov **to seek guidance on how to do so.**\n    \n    All prime organizations must also continue to maintain an active SAM.gov registration with current information at all times during which they have an active Federal award or application under consideration by a Federal award agency. SAM.gov requires all entities to renew their registration once a year to maintain an active registration status in SAM. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure it has an active registration in SAM.gov and to maintain that active registration. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements at the time of application, the applicant may be deemed technically ineligible to receive an award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant.\n    \n    Please refer to 2 CFR 25.200 for additional information.\n    \n\n**Note: SAM.gov is not the same as SAMS Domestic. It is free of charge to register in both systems, but the registration processes are different**. **_Information is included on the SAM.gov website to help international registrations, including “Quick Start Guide for International Registrations” and “Helpful Hints.” Navigate to www.SAM.gov, click “HELP” in the top navigationbar, then click, “Explore” and “New to SAM.gov?” for general information. Please note, guidance on SAM.gov and the guidance on GSA’s website about requirement for registering in SAM.gov is subject to change. Applicants should review the website for the most up-to-date guidance._**\n\n**_Exemptions_**\n\nAn exemption from these requirements may be permitted on a case-by-case basis if:\n\n*   ●  An applicant’s identity must be protected due to potential endangerment of their mission, their organization’s status, their employees, or individuals being served by the applicant.\n    \n*   ●  For an applicant, if the Federal awarding agency makes a determination that there are exigent circumstances that prohibit the applicant from receiving a unique entity identifier and completing SAM registration prior to receiving a Federal award. In these instances, Federal awarding agencies must require the recipient to obtain a unique entity identifier and complete SAM registration within 30 days of the Federal award date.\n    \n    Organizations requesting exemption from UEI or SAM.gov requirements must email the point of contact listed in the NOFO at least **two weeks prior to the deadline in the NOFO providing a justification of their request**. Approval for a SAM.gov exemption must come from the warranted Grants Officer before the application can be deemed eligible for review.\n    \n    **Guidelines for Budget Justification**\n    \n    _Personnel_: Describes the wages, salaries, and benefits of temporary or permanent staff who will be working directly for the applicant on the project, and the percentage of their time that will be spent on the project.\n    \n\n_Travel:_ Estimates the costs of travel and per diem for this project. If the project involves international travel, include a brief statement of justification for that travel.\n\n_Equipment_: Describes any machinery, furniture, or other personal property that is required for the project, which has a useful life of more than one year (or a life longer than the duration of the project), and costs at least $5,000 per unit.\n\n_Supplies_: Lists and describes all the items and materials, including any computer devices, that are needed for the project. If an item costs more than $5,000 per unit, then put it in the budget under Equipment.\n\n_Contractual:_ Describes goods and services that the applicant plans to acquire through a contract with a vendor. Also describes any sub-awards to non-profit partners that will help carry out the project activities.\n\n_Other Direct Costs:_ Describes other costs directly associated with the project, which do not fit in the other categories. For example, shipping costs for materials and equipment or applicable taxes. All “Other” or “Miscellaneous” expenses must be itemized and explained.\n\n_Indirect Costs:_ These are costs that cannot be linked directly to the project activities, such as overhead costs needed to help keep the organization operating. If your organization has a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate (NICRA) and includes NICRA charges in the budget, attach a copy of your latest NICRA. Organizations that have never had a NICRA may request indirect costs of 10% of the modified total direct costs as defined in 2 CFR 200.68.\n\n“Cost Sharing” refers to contributions from the organization or other entities other than the U.S. Embassy. It also includes in-kind contributions such as volunteers’ time and donated venues.",

Federal Award Notices** The grant award or cooperative agreement will be written, signed, awarded, and administered by the Grants Officer. The assistance award agreement is the authorizing document, and it will be provided to the recipient for review and signature by email. The recipient may only start incurring project expenses beginning on the start date shown on the grant award document signed by the Grants Officer. If a proposal is selected for funding, the Department of State has no obligation to provide any additional future funding. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the discretion of the Department of State. Issuance of this Annual Program Statement does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the U.S. government, nor does it commit the U.S. government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of proposals. Further, the U.S. government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.\n\n**Payment Method:** Payments will be made in, at least, two installments as needed to carry out the project activities.\n\n2\\. AdministrativeandNationalPolicyRequirements **Terms and Conditions:** Before submitting an application, applicants should review all the terms and conditions and required certifications which will apply to this award, to ensure that they will be able to comply. These include: 2 CFR 200, 2 CFR 600, Certifications and Assurances, and the Department of State Standard Terms and Conditions, all of which are available at: https://www.state.gov/about- us-office-of-the-procurement-executive/. Note the U.S Flag branding and marking requirements in the Standard Terms and Conditions.\n\n3\\. Reporting **Reporting Requirements:** Recipients will be required to submit financial reports and project reports. The award document will specify how often these reports must be submitted.\n\nG. **FEDERAL AWARDING AGENCY CONTACTS** If you have any questions about the grant application process, please contact PDS Beirut at: PDBeirutgrants@state.gov.\n\nNote: We do not provide any pre-consultation for application-specific questions that are addressed in the Annual Program Statement. Once an application has been submitted, State Department officials and staff — both in the Department and at embassies overseas — may not discuss this competition with applicants until the entire proposal review process is completed.\n\nH. **OTHER INFORMATION _Unique Entity Identifier and System for Award Management (SAM)_** All prime organizations, whether based in the United States or in another country, must have a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and an active registration with the SAM.gov **before applying**. PDS Beirut may **not** review applications from or make awards to applicants that have not completed all applicable UEI and SAM.gov requirements. A UEI is one of the data elements mandated by Public Law 109- 282, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA), for all Federal awards.\n\nThe 2 CFR 200 requires that sub-grantees obtain a UEI number. Please note the UEI for sub-grantees is not required at the time of application but will be required before the award is processed and/or directed to a sub-grantee.\n\n**_Note: The process of obtaining or renewing a SAM.gov registration may take anywhere from 4-8 weeks. Please begin your registration as early as possible._**\n\n*   ●  Organizations **based in the United States** or that pay employees within the United States will need an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov.\n    \n*   ●  Organizations **based outside of the United States** and that do not pay employees within the United States do not need an EIN from the IRS but do need a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov. **Please note that as of December 2022, organizations based outside of the United States awards are no longer required to have a NATO CAGE (NCAGE) code to apply for non-DoD foreign assistance funding opportunities. If an applicant organization is mid- registration and wishes to remove an NCAGE code from their sam.gov registration, the applicant should** submit a help desk ticket (“incident”) **with the Federal Service Desk (FSD) online at** www.fsd.gov **to seek guidance on how to do so.**\n    \n    All prime organizations must also continue to maintain an active SAM.gov registration with current information at all times during which they have an active Federal award or application under consideration by a Federal award agency. SAM.gov requires all entities to renew their registration once a year to maintain an active registration status in SAM. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure it has an active registration in SAM.gov and to maintain that active registration. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements at the time of application, the applicant may be deemed technically ineligible to receive an award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant.\n    \n    Please refer to 2 CFR 25.200 for additional information.\n    \n\n**Note: SAM.gov is not the same as SAMS Domestic. It is free of charge to register in both systems, but the registration processes are different**. **_Information is included on the SAM.gov website to help international registrations, including “Quick Start Guide for International Registrations” and “Helpful Hints.” Navigate to www.SAM.gov, click “HELP” in the top navigationbar, then click, “Explore” and “New to SAM.gov?” for general information. Please note, guidance on SAM.gov and the guidance on GSA’s website about requirement for registering in SAM.gov is subject to change. Applicants should review the website for the most up-to-date guidance._**\n\n**_Exemptions_**\n\nAn exemption from these requirements may be permitted on a case-by-case basis if:\n\n*   ●  An applicant’s identity must be protected due to potential endangerment of their mission, their organization’s status, their employees, or individuals being served by the applicant.\n    \n*   ●  For an applicant, if the Federal awarding agency makes a determination that there are exigent circumstances that prohibit the applicant from receiving a unique entity identifier and completing SAM registration prior to receiving a Federal award. In these instances, Federal awarding agencies must require the recipient to obtain a unique entity identifier and complete SAM registration within 30 days of the Federal award date.\n    \n    Organizations requesting exemption from UEI or SAM.gov requirements must email the point of contact listed in the NOFO at least **two weeks prior to the deadline in the NOFO providing a justification of their request**. Approval for a SAM.gov exemption must come from the warranted Grants Officer before the application can be deemed eligible for review.\n    \n    **Guidelines for Budget Justification**\n    \n    _Personnel_: Describes the wages, salaries, and benefits of temporary or permanent staff who will be working directly for the applicant on the project, and the percentage of their time that will be spent on the project.\n    \n\n_Travel:_ Estimates the costs of travel and per diem for this project. If the project involves international travel, include a brief statement of justification for that travel.\n\n_Equipment_: Describes any machinery, furniture, or other personal property that is required for the project, which has a useful life of more than one year (or a life longer than the duration of the project), and costs at least $5,000 per unit.\n\n_Supplies_: Lists and describes all the items and materials, including any computer devices, that are needed for the project. If an item costs more than $5,000 per unit, then put it in the budget under Equipment.\n\n_Contractual:_ Describes goods and services that the applicant plans to acquire through a contract with a vendor. Also describes any sub-awards to non-profit partners that will help carry out the project activities.\n\n_Other Direct Costs:_ Describes other costs directly associated with the project, which do not fit in the other categories. For example, shipping costs for materials and equipment or applicable taxes. All “Other” or “Miscellaneous” expenses must be itemized and explained.\n\n_Indirect Costs:_ These are costs that cannot be linked directly to the project activities, such as overhead costs needed to help keep the organization operating. If your organization has a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate (NICRA) and includes NICRA charges in the budget, attach a copy of your latest NICRA. Organizations that have never had a NICRA may request indirect costs of 10% of the modified total direct costs as defined in 2 CFR 200.68.\n\n“Cost Sharing” refers to contributions from the organization or other entities other than the U.S. Embassy. It also includes in-kind contributions such as volunteers’ time and donated venues.",

We would advise interested startups to carefully review the priorities and eligibility criteria listed in the Annual Program Statement to ensure their proposals align well. Since the funding is intended for public diplomacy and cultural exchange, the startups should articulate a clear vision on how their proposed projects or programs can improve mutual understanding between the people of Lebanon and the United States. \n\n2. Given the variety of themes listed such as civic engagement, English learning, educational exchange, arts, and culture, there are opportunities for startups from different sectors. However, the startups need to demonstrate strong expertise and experience in their respective fields. They should provide concrete evidence of their past work and accomplishments.\n\n3. The startups should pay extra attention to the budget guidelines and ensure all costs included are reasonable, allocable and allowable. They need to give budget justifications for all the major budget items. The budgets should be prudent yet realistic to implement the programs.\n\n4. Since the maximum funding for each award is $450,000, the startups may consider collaborating with other partners, especially American organizations or individuals. The partnerships and collaborations will likely strengthen the proposals by bringing complementary expertise and resources. Letters of support from the key partners are recommended. \n\n5. The startups should also highlight the monitoring and evaluation plan, especially on how to assess the outcomes and long-term impacts. They may identify potential risks and challenges and propose contingency plans. The sustainability of the programs beyond the funding period will also be positively viewed.\n\n6. Given the two-stage application deadlines, the interested startups should start the preparation as soon as possible. They need to allocate sufficient time to develop quality proposals, obtain necessary registrations such as Unique Entity Identifier and SAM.gov registration, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the application process.\n\n7. The startups are advised to directly contact the Public Diplomacy Section at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut for clarifications on the Annual Program Statement. However, they cannot discuss any application-specific questions with the officers until the review process is completed. The startups should rely on the guidelines provided in the Annual Program Statement.\n\nIn summary, this is a good opportunity for startups in Lebanon to pitch innovative programs that can foster the partnership and cultural connections between the United States and Lebanon. With proper preparation and strategic planning, the startups stand a good chance to receive the grants to implement their initiatives. We wish all the startups the best of luck with their applications!",

      "content": "Here are 5 ideas Bloom can consider for the grant application:\n\n1. Online entrepreneurship education program for youth and women in underserved communities outside Beirut. Bloom can leverage its expertise in developing online courses and content to expand access to entrepreneurship education beyond Beirut. This program can also involve mentorship and coaching components to support the participants.\n\n2. Hybrid accelerator program for social enterprises promoting civic engagement and human rights. Bloom can design a multi-stage program to accelerate innovative social enterprises in Lebanon that aim to advance civic participation, transparency, minorities' rights, etc. The program may include both online and in-person components, bootcamps, mentorship, and demo days. \n\n3. English learning and cultural exchange program in partnership with U.S. educational institutions. Bloom can develop an English language and cultural immersion program in collaboration with American universities or community colleges. The program can sponsor Lebanese youth to travel to the U.S. for English studies and cultural exchange. \n\n4. Performing arts exchange program. Bloom can propose a program to sponsor performing arts groups from Lebanon to perform and conduct workshops in the U.S., and vice versa, American groups to perform in Lebanon. The program aims to promote cultural understanding through arts and music.\n\n5. Educational partnership to support entrepreneurs and accelerators. Bloom can suggest establishing an educational partnership with U.S. accelerators or entrepreneurship education organizations to co-develop curriculum, case studies, mentoring programs, and toolkits for entrepreneurs and accelerator managers in Lebanon. The partnership can also involve knowledge and best practice exchange between the U.S. and Lebanese organizations.\n\nThese are a few ideas for programs that can leverage Bloom's strengths, experience as well as partnerships to achieve the goals of promoting mutual understanding and cooperation between the civil society and youth in Lebanon and the U.S. The programs should also clearly incorporate the American elements through collaboration or exchange with U.S. entities. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of the ideas. I can also provide suggestions on other potential program areas if needed.",

            "text": "Here are 5 ideas Bloom can consider for the grant application:\n\n1. Online entrepreneurship education program for youth and women in underserved communities outside Beirut. Bloom can leverage its expertise in developing online courses and content to expand access to entrepreneurship education beyond Beirut. This program can also involve mentorship and coaching components to support the participants.\n\n2. Hybrid accelerator program for social enterprises promoting civic engagement and human rights. Bloom can design a multi-stage program to accelerate innovative social enterprises in Lebanon that aim to advance civic participation, transparency, minorities' rights, etc. The program may include both online and in-person components, bootcamps, mentorship, and demo days. \n\n3. English learning and cultural exchange program in partnership with U.S. educational institutions. Bloom can develop an English language and cultural immersion program in collaboration with American universities or community colleges. The program can sponsor Lebanese youth to travel to the U.S. for English studies and cultural exchange. \n\n4. Performing arts exchange program. Bloom can propose a program to sponsor performing arts groups from Lebanon to perform and conduct workshops in the U.S., and vice versa, American groups to perform in Lebanon. The program aims to promote cultural understanding through arts and music.\n\n5. Educational partnership to support entrepreneurs and accelerators. Bloom can suggest establishing an educational partnership with U.S. accelerators or entrepreneurship education organizations to co-develop curriculum, case studies, mentoring programs, and toolkits for entrepreneurs and accelerator managers in Lebanon. The partnership can also involve knowledge and best practice exchange between the U.S. and Lebanese organizations.\n\nThese are a few ideas for programs that can leverage Bloom's strengths, experience as well as partnerships to achieve the goals of promoting mutual understanding and cooperation between the civil society and youth in Lebanon and the U.S. The programs should also clearly incorporate the American elements through collaboration or exchange with U.S. entities. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of the ideas. I can also provide suggestions on other potential program areas if needed.",

      "content": "Great point. Given Bloom's expertise and tools in entrepreneurship education and support, it makes sense to focus the proposals on your core strengths. Here are some revised ideas:\n\n1. Entrepreneurship soft skills and wellbeing program. Bloom can propose designing a tailored program to help Lebanese entrepreneurs and startups develop critical soft skills such as communication, collaboration, emotional intelligence, and growth mindset. The program can also incorporate wellbeing components such as managing stress and work-life balance. Bloom can utilize its assessment tools and online courses for this program. \n\n2. Social entrepreneurship acceleration program. Bloom can suggest running a multi-stage hybrid acceleration program specifically targeting early-stage social enterprises in Lebanon. The program provides training, mentorship, access to networks and funding opportunities for the participating social entrepreneurs. Bloom can work with U.S. social enterprise accelerators or impact investors as program partners.  \n\n3. Youth entrepreneurship program. Bloom can propose an initiative to promote youth entrepreneurship and job creation in Lebanon, in partnership with U.S. youth entrepreneurship organizations. The program combines online training, in-person bootcamps, mentorship, and seed funding opportunities for young Lebanese entrepreneurs. Bloom's entrepreneurship education platform and tools can be leveraged for this program.\n\n4. Entrepreneurship ecosystem mapping and development. Bloom can propose conducting a comprehensive mapping of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Lebanon, evaluating gaps and needs across the system. Based on the findings, Bloom will design interventions and programs in collaboration with U.S. ecosystem builders to strengthen the ecosystem. This can involve online tools, education programs, policy recommendations, access to networks, etc. \n\n5. Accelerator management and curriculum toolkits. Bloom can suggest developing toolkits and resources for accelerator managers and entrepreneurship educators based on its experience. In partnership with U.S. accelerators, Bloom provides training and toolkits on topics such as program design, instructional skills, mentor engagement, and measurement & evaluation. The initiative aims at enhancing the quality and social impact of entrepreneurship programs in Lebanon and beyond.\n\nThese revised ideas focus on Bloom's unique expertise, tools and network in the entrepreneurship education and social enterprise sectors. The proposed programs tap into partnerships with U.S. organizations to facilitate mutual learning and cooperation. Please let me know your feedback and if you would like me to explain further on any of the ideas. I can also provide more suggestions if needed.",

PDS Beirut may **not** review applications from or make awards to applicants that have not completed all applicable UEI and SAM.gov requirements. A UEI is one of the data elements mandated by Public Law 109- 282, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA), for all Federal awards.\n\nThe 2 CFR 200 requires that sub-grantees obtain a UEI number. Please note the UEI for sub-grantees is not required at the time of application but will be required before the award is processed and/or directed to a sub-grantee.\n\n**_Note: The process of obtaining or renewing a SAM.gov registration may take anywhere from 4-8 weeks. Please begin your registration as early as possible._**\n\n*   ●  Organizations **based in the United States** or that pay employees within the United States will need an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov.\n    \n*   ●  Organizations **based outside of the United States** and that do not pay employees within the United States do not need an EIN from the IRS but do need a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov. **Please note that as of December 2022, organizations based outside of the United States awards are no longer required to have a NATO CAGE (NCAGE) code to apply for non-DoD foreign assistance funding opportunities. If an applicant organization is mid- registration and wishes to remove an NCAGE code from their sam.gov registration, the applicant should** submit a help desk ticket (“incident”) **with the Federal Service Desk (FSD) online at** www.fsd.gov **to seek guidance on how to do so.**\n    \n    All prime organizations must also continue to maintain an active SAM.gov registration with current information at all times during which they have an active Federal award or application under consideration by a Federal award agency. SAM.gov requires all entities to renew their registration once a year to maintain an active registration status in SAM. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure it has an active registration in SAM.gov and to maintain that active registration. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements at the time of application, the applicant may be deemed technically ineligible to receive an award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant.\n    \n    Please refer to 2 CFR 25.200 for additional information.\n    \n\n**Note: SAM.gov is not the same as SAMS Domestic.

PDS Beirut may **not** review applications from or make awards to applicants that have not completed all applicable UEI and SAM.gov requirements. A UEI is one of the data elements mandated by Public Law 109- 282, the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA), for all Federal awards.\n\nThe 2 CFR 200 requires that sub-grantees obtain a UEI number. Please note the UEI for sub-grantees is not required at the time of application but will be required before the award is processed and/or directed to a sub-grantee.\n\n**_Note: The process of obtaining or renewing a SAM.gov registration may take anywhere from 4-8 weeks. Please begin your registration as early as possible._**\n\n*   ●  Organizations **based in the United States** or that pay employees within the United States will need an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, and a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov.\n    \n*   ●  Organizations **based outside of the United States** and that do not pay employees within the United States do not need an EIN from the IRS but do need a UEI number prior to registering in SAM.gov. **Please note that as of December 2022, organizations based outside of the United States awards are no longer required to have a NATO CAGE (NCAGE) code to apply for non-DoD foreign assistance funding opportunities. If an applicant organization is mid- registration and wishes to remove an NCAGE code from their sam.gov registration, the applicant should** submit a help desk ticket (“incident”) **with the Federal Service Desk (FSD) online at** www.fsd.gov **to seek guidance on how to do so.**\n    \n    All prime organizations must also continue to maintain an active SAM.gov registration with current information at all times during which they have an active Federal award or application under consideration by a Federal award agency. SAM.gov requires all entities to renew their registration once a year to maintain an active registration status in SAM. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure it has an active registration in SAM.gov and to maintain that active registration. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements at the time of application, the applicant may be deemed technically ineligible to receive an award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant.\n    \n    Please refer to 2 CFR 25.200 for additional information.\n    \n\n**Note: SAM.gov is not the same as SAMS Domestic. It is free of charge to register in both systems, but the registration processes are different**. **_Information is included on the SAM.gov website to help international registrations, including “Quick Start Guide for International Registrations” and “Helpful Hints.” Navigate to www.SAM.gov, click “HELP” in the top navigationbar, then click, “Explore” and “New to SAM.gov?” for general information.

      "content": "Based on the priorities and goals stated in the Annual Program Statement, the Public Diplomacy Section would likely be most excited to fund proposals that:\n\n1. Promote inclusive civic engagement and advance human rights, especially for marginalized groups. Programs that empower women, youth, minorities and underserved communities to participate meaningfully in the public sphere and decision making processes would be appealing. \n\n2. Foster mutual understanding between the people of Lebanon and the U.S. through cultural and educational exchange. Proposals that facilitate partnership and exchange between Lebanese and American schools, artists, musicians, etc. would be strategic.\n\n3. Enhance English language learning and skills development. Programs that improve English proficiency and learning opportunities for Lebanese youth and professionals would be impactful.\n\n4. Support arts and cultural programming to share the diversity of American and Lebanese arts. Initiatives that sponsor cultural performances, exhibits, workshops, etc. featuring both American and Lebanese artistic traditions would resonate.\n\n5. Address civic engagement and human rights issues through creative mediums. Proposals that harness the power of arts, music, media, technology, etc. to raise awareness, spread messages and promote participation on key issues would be innovative. \n\n6. Engage marginalized groups and underserved populations outside Beirut. Programs specifically tailored to empower and serve vulnerable groups in more remote areas of Lebanon would help achieve inclusiveness.  \n\n7. Establish educational partnership between Lebanese and U.S. institutions. Proposals that facilitate collaboration between higher education institutions, youth organizations, schools, etc. in Lebanon and the U.S. through knowledge exchange, curriculum co-development, joint programs, etc. would build strong partnership.\n\nIn summary, the proposals that are most likely to excite and receive priority from the Public Diplomacy Section should aim to: empower marginalized groups, advance civic participation, foster exchange between Lebanese and Americans, enhance English learning, harness arts/culture, and promote human rights - all contributing to a shared vision of mutual understanding, inclusiveness, and partnership. Applicants that can creatively and thoughtfully address these goals will have a competitive advantage.\n\nDoes this help summarize some of the priorities and suggestions for impactful proposals? Let me know if you have any other questions!",

Initiatives that sponsor cultural performances, exhibits, workshops, etc. featuring both American and Lebanese artistic traditions would resonate.\n\n5. Address civic engagement and human rights issues through creative mediums. Proposals that harness the power of arts, music, media, technology, etc. to raise awareness, spread messages and promote participation on key issues would be innovative. \n\n6. Engage marginalized groups and underserved populations outside Beirut. Programs specifically tailored to empower and serve vulnerable groups in more remote areas of Lebanon would help achieve inclusiveness.  \n\n7. Establish educational partnership between Lebanese and U.S. institutions. Proposals that facilitate collaboration between higher education institutions, youth organizations, schools, etc. in Lebanon and the U.S. through knowledge exchange, curriculum co-development, joint programs, etc. would build strong partnership.\n\nIn summary, the proposals that are most likely to excite and receive priority from the Public Diplomacy Section should aim to: empower marginalized groups, advance civic participation, foster exchange between Lebanese and Americans, enhance English learning, harness arts/culture, and promote human rights - all contributing to a shared vision of mutual understanding, inclusiveness, and partnership. Applicants that can creatively and thoughtfully address these goals will have a competitive advantage.\n\nDoes this help summarize some of the priorities and suggestions for impactful proposals? Let me know if you have any other questions!",

This program can provide tailored courses and coaching on business and soft skills for aspiring women and youth entrepreneurs in underserved areas of Lebanon. Bloom can leverage its online learning platform and curriculum to reach more beneficiaries beyond Beirut. \n\n2. Acceleration program for social enterprises promoting civic engagement. Bloom can design a multi-stage hybrid program to accelerate social enterprises that aim to advance civic participation, transparency and human rights in Lebanon. The program offers both online and in-person training, mentorship and networking opportunities. \n\n3. Entrepreneurship program for marginalized groups in partnership with U.S. organizations. Bloom can propose an initiative empowering vulnerable groups such as migrants, disabled, etc. to start their own businesses. In collaboration with U.S. organizations focused on inclusive entrepreneurship, Bloom provides tailored support and exchange opportunities for program participants from both countries.\n\n4. Educational partnership to support entrepreneurship educators. Bloom can suggest establishing a partnership with U.S. accelerators or entrepreneurship education providers to co-develop curriculum and resources for educators and program managers. Through knowledge exchange workshops, podcasts, toolkits, etc. the partnership aims to build the capacity of entrepreneurship educators and improve program quality.  \n\n5. Entrepreneurial arts and cultural program. Bloom can propose an initiative using arts, music, media, etc. to raise awareness and participation of key civic issues that matter to youth and marginalized groups. The program provides opportunity and platform for aspiring artists, musicians, content creators, etc. to express themselves and spread social messages. In partnership with U.S. arts organizations, it also fosters cultural exchange between the creative scenes in Lebanon and the U.S.\n\nThese ideas tap into Bloom's experience in entrepreneurship education, social enterprise and empowering youth and women. The proposed programs aim to engage vulnerable and underserved groups, with partnerships with U.S. organizations incorporated to facilitate exchange and mutual learning. The programs harness innovative mediums such as online learning, arts and culture to achieve social impact. Please let me know your feedback on these ideas and how I can further improve them!",
