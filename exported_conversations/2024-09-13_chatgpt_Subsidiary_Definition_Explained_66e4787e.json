The parent company holds a majority of the subsidiary's voting stock, giving it control over the subsidiary's operations, management decisions, and policies. Subsidiaries can operate independently in terms of their day-to-day functions, but they remain accountable to the parent company. Subsidiaries are often established to manage different business areas, reduce risk, or take advantage of specific markets. \n\nWould you like more examples or explanations about how subsidiaries function in business strategy?",
