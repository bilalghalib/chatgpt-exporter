      "content": "Ah, I see what happened — the crepe batter stuck and baked onto the bottom of the pan. A few reasons this happens with sourdough starter crepes, and some fixes:  \n\n### Why it sticks:\n- **Pan type**: If that’s a nonstick pan but scratched/worn, it will cling. Sourdough batter especially likes to stick because of the natural sugars and proteins.\n- **Heat level**: If the pan isn’t hot enough before pouring, the batter fuses instead of “sealing” quickly. Too hot, and it burns.\n- **Fat**: Sourdough crepes usually need a bit more fat (butter or oil) than regular crepes to release cleanly.\n- **First crepe problem**: The very first one often sticks — the pan needs to build up a thin layer of oil seasoning.\n\n### How to prevent sticking:\n1. **Preheat properly**: Heat the pan over medium for a few minutes before adding batter. Test by sprinkling in a drop of water — it should sizzle and dance.\n2. **Grease lightly but evenly**: Wipe the pan with a thin film of butter or neutral oil (use a paper towel to spread it). Re-wipe between crepes if it starts sticking again.\n3. **Thin batter**: If your starter is very thick, loosen it with a bit of milk or water. Crepe batter should spread thin and evenly.\n4. **Use a good surface**: Nonstick or a well-seasoned cast iron works best. Stainless steel tends to stick unless perfectly seasoned.\n5. **The sacrificial first crepe**: Accept that the first one might stick, but after that the pan gets conditioned and the rest usually come out better.\n\n👉 Pro tip: If it already stuck like in your photo, soak the pan with warm water right away — sourdough crust dissolves faster if it doesn’t fully dry out.\n\nDo you want me to suggest a **revised crepe batter recipe for sourdough starter** that’s less sticky and more forgiving, or would you rather stick with adjusting your current mix?",

      "content": "Good question — you can absolutely save this pan and keep going, but it’s better to clean it first before making more crepes, otherwise the burnt/stuck layer will just keep making the next ones stick.  \n\n### Best way to clean now (without damaging pan):\n1. **Soak**: Fill the pan with warm water (not boiling, just hot tap water) and let it sit 10–15 minutes. This loosens the sourdough crust.  \n2. **Scrape gently**: Use a wooden spatula or plastic scraper (not metal, to protect the surface) to lift off the softened bits.  \n3. **Rinse & wipe**: Rinse and wipe clean. If stubborn, sprinkle in a little baking soda + water paste and scrub with a soft sponge.  \n\n### Then before restarting:\n- Dry the pan fully.  \n- Heat it empty for a couple of minutes (medium heat).  \n- Add a thin wipe of oil or butter before pouring new batter.  \n\n⚡️ If you just add oil now without cleaning, the old stuck layer will burn more and keep releasing bits into your new crepes.  \n\nDo you want me to give you a **quick rescue trick** so you don’t have to scrub hard (like boiling water with a bit of baking soda in the pan)?",

      "content": "Here’s how I’d do it for sourdough crepes:  \n\n- **Pan** → Always oil or butter the pan lightly before each crepe (wipe with a paper towel so it’s a thin film, not a pool). That’s what really prevents sticking.  \n- **Batter** → A little fat inside the batter helps too (melted butter, ghee, or a neutral oil, about 1–2 tablespoons per cup of starter/flour mix). This makes the crepes more supple and less likely to tear, but on its own it won’t stop sticking if the pan isn’t greased.  \n\n👉 So: **both** is best. Batter with some fat inside **+** a well-oiled pan (light coat, refreshed as needed).  \n\nDo you want me to suggest an exact ratio you can stir into your existing batter right now to rescue it, or will you make a fresh batch?",
