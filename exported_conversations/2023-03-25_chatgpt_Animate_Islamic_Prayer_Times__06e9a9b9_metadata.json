The 27-hour debugging marathon reveals dedication to projects that matter personally, not just professional work.",
  "analyst_notes": "This conversation is remarkably revealing: 1) Bilal is a practicing Muslim (prayer times matter enough to visualize), 2) He integrates faith and tech naturally, 3) He has 'marathon focus' capacity for meaningful projects, 4) He values elegance (single-language solution), 5) He's in/aware of Paris in 2023. The persistence over 27 hours for a personal spiritual tool (not client work) shows what drives him intrinsically."
