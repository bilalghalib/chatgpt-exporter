And I hope Lalal\n07:21: also gets to share his journey with you\n07:25: and a little bit of his life story, because it'll blow you away.\n07:29: And also just his energy, his aura\n07:33: is really infectious. So you really get to see a lot\n07:37: of that today. So I won't\n07:40: dabble too much into the story. I'm sure you've read a little bit about it.\n07:45: But what I can tell you is that his perspective\n07:49: and his passion for the\n07:52: work to bring communities together, to get communities to believe\n07:56: in themselves and in each other, is unmatched.\n07:59: And I hope we get to see even a little bit of\n08:02: a glimmer of that with all of you today. So over to\n08:06: you. Okay. All right. Thank you so much.\n08:10: I am, yeah, I'm so glad that we\n08:14: have some good time together today. And it looks like.\n08:17: Okay, so we have people that are working on actually a\n08:21: couple of water pollution. Um, there's people already on the\n08:25: prototyping, which is awesome. And it never hurts to\n08:28: go back and think about the challenge a little bit deeper.\n08:31: Um, so, inshallah, everyone will benefit today.\n08:34: Um, and. And it looks like we have a bunch\n08:37: of active and engaged people. That's so for me,\n08:42: you know, when you do a workshop, especially when it's virtual, it can\n08:45: be really challenging. So as I. Do you guys know how to do this?\n08:50: One second. Check this out.\n08:54: You guys know how to do that? Can you see my screen with the hearts\n08:57: floating around? Do you guys know how to, like, add different\n09:02: gestures or chat\n09:05: in the chat? If you know how to chat in the chat,\n09:09: like write your nickname or what your parents called you when you were a kid?\n09:12: Okay. My parents called me Bulbul. I want to\n09:15: see some Chat moving. Okay. So feel free. I want to see. I want to\n09:19: see people reacting. Yeah, what up? I'm. You know\n09:22: what? You can even add it to your name. That'll be kind of cool.\n09:24: Like, get familiar and happy with Zoom.\n09:27: We live in an age where we\n09:33: often are talking online, but we're\n09:36: just passive. Okay? So please, I will not\n09:39: be annoyed if you add bunny emojis like Nihal just did\n09:43: or. Or if you're adding stuff in the chat. I'm gonna be monitoring it.\n09:46: You know, we have Nihal here. She's my\n09:49: colleague. I have these co conspirators with Nihal and\n09:53: Joyce. We can handle you guys. Okay?\n09:56: So whatever you want, bring it,\n09:59: and it'll be way more fun for me and hopefully more\n10:02: fun for you guys. So thank you, Joyce. Thank you,\n10:05: Lucy. Thank you, I guess. Thank you,\n10:08: Parker. Lucy, your parents called you Parker. Is that true?\n10:13: Okay. Okay. Can we just get, like a short story about that before\n10:16: we begin? And then. And then I'll get into my slides. I promise I'll do,\n10:19: like, some serious work. But, yeah,\n10:22: okay. Well, when I was\n10:25: young, I used to love Spider Man.\n10:28: Yeah. So his name was Peter Parker,\n10:33: so I really loved him. I love the costumes,\n10:37: everything. So they were like, okay, now we're going to call you\n10:40: Parker, and I go by Parker now on social media.\n10:43: So, yeah. Amazing. Amazing. Okay.\n10:47: You know, with great power comes\n10:50: great responsibility. Absolutely, absolutely. And so, you know,\n10:53: what we have in this room right now, we're going to talk about something called\n10:58: the eight forms of capital. You know, capital is a kind of\n11:01: power in our age. And we're going to see that this room\n11:04: is actually really, really just full of power. And hopefully you\n11:09: guys are beginning to see that and connect with each\n11:12: other. I. You know, I'm not as involved as\n11:16: Nihal and Joyce, but really, when I see a room full of people\n11:19: that are, like, seeing challenges of water, seeing their communities without jobs,\n11:23: and think, like, wait, what can we do about this? It really is inspiring\n11:27: and I'm really hoping to, yeah.\n11:30: Share something interesting about a little bit about my journey and\n11:34: in the process, learning about yours as well. So I'm going to share my\n11:37: screen. Let me just share everything,\n11:41: and then I'll go here and Bismillah. Okay.\n11:47: Joyce, Nihal, please be monitoring the chat.\n11:50: If. If you guys want to, like, interrupt me and tell, like, a really\n11:54: amazing story or something like that, I'd be way more\n11:58: than happy to oblige. So feel free.\n12:01: Raise your hand so I can see you guys pop up as you guys know,\n12:04: Zoom only gives me this little sliver of a window for all of the\n12:08: faces. So use the hand raising thingy\n12:11: Mabob or how do you do that over here? That way it actually shows you\n12:15: up on my screen. Okay, so bespin and sorry and\n12:19: sorry, if you can, as we start\n12:23: to have more discussions, please turn on your camera so we\n12:27: can have a more personalized conversation and you\n12:30: can build a much deeper relationship as we\n12:34: proceed with the workshop. So unless your connection is,\n12:37: is not allowing you to do that, I, I would really appreciate turning\n12:40: on your camera. Maybe when you're presenting it's fine, but like\n12:44: when we're having conversations, I would really appreciate that.\n12:47: All right, sorry. Bilal, over to you. Yeah, no worries about it. I did hear\n12:50: that we have people from, I mean I saw people from all over the world\n12:53: and I used to live in Lebanon and the power would just cut arbitrarily.\n12:57: Like I'd be in the middle of a very important work session and the power\n12:59: would go blank and it would be like this and then I'd have to come\n13:03: back. So I understand what it's like to be in a place without power and\n13:07: without good access to Internet.\n13:10: But today we're going to be trying to keep it as\n13:13: interactive as possible. So in the chat, in breakout\n13:16: rooms, if, if you're not able to share,\n13:19: it will actually be kind of difficult for\n13:23: me to facilitate because when I break send people into breakout rooms,\n13:28: I hope that you're able to share. So without a video, totally fine.\n13:31: Even if you have to type, totally fine. But I hope you guys are ready\n13:34: to be engaged and connecting with each other today.\n13:38: That's one of the things that I think Nihal mentioned is\n13:42: really a lot of my dream. You know, I used to be an engineer.\n13:45: I used to build robots for recycling machines.\n13:49: And I had this thought one day, I was like,\n13:53: oh, okay. So let's say that I solved this very specific\n13:56: technical engineering problem trying to do good in the world, right? Work on\n13:59: recycling. Then I would solve another one and then I'd\n14:03: solve another one and maybe I could have three breakthroughs in my life\n14:06: versus what if I became a teacher\n14:10: and started sharing this idea that we can together.\n14:14: If we see a challenge in the world, if we start to\n14:18: realize that the world that we see is co constructed.\n14:22: Of course there are people that are, you know,\n14:26: creating more of some\n14:29: of the difficulties and the challenges than others.\n14:33: But we are all a part of this. The way that\n14:37: the we put our energy where\n14:41: we place our feet where we vote with\n14:45: our resources and where we shop and how\n14:48: we do things. These are the ways that we actually co construct\n14:51: the world, not just with our projects. And when we actually take\n14:55: an active role in creating a project and saying okay this,\n15:00: this world is like this, I can either fit into it or if we see\n15:03: the world and we think okay, it's not exactly how I would like\n15:07: it to be, maybe there's something that I can do about it then\n15:11: we're actually more engaged in becoming active co constructors and so\n15:15: I hope that this, it's so interesting. Prototyping with\n15:19: and in marginalized communities. The word marginalized\n15:23: is so interesting for me and I really hope that we get to\n15:26: talk about it. Does anybody want to kind of tell\n15:30: me what they think about this title about like prototyping in and with marginalized communities?\n15:34: What does it mean for you? You can feel free to raise your hand,\n15:36: put it in the chat.\n15:41: Bloop. Go ahead Ricardo.\n15:45: So well my context it would be\n15:49: communities far away from the center of\n15:52: the country, center of the cities we have here.\n15:57: So what I'm expecting\n16:02: startup is on how to engage with them.\n16:05: Since I'm not someone that has. I've been like far away from the cities but\n16:09: not in these communities. So I'm expecting to learn tools to\n16:12: engage properly with them. Yeah,\n16:15: absolutely. Interesting. I didn't, I didn't actually think about that but that\n16:18: makes a lot of sense that especially when there\n16:22: are people that you feel for and that you see the\n16:25: challenges of people in maybe the outskirts of\n16:30: city and you might think okay, how can I break in in an\n16:33: appropriate way and, and enter into a conversation that\n16:37: that's actually a really important thing that inshaallah. We'll talk\n16:41: about it a little bit today and but I'll just\n16:44: straight off the bat share a small story of a\n16:49: kid named Saleh. Saleh and I met\n16:53: in a refugee camp in Lebanon. So I'm a college educated person. I came from\n16:57: America, I flew to Lebanon and I knew nobody.\n17:00: And what started happening was\n17:05: I know, okay, this is just a personal reflection but my, my experience\n17:09: but I found that language\n17:14: and making sure that language was there. So being able\n17:17: to speak Arabic was really helpful. And then food sounds\n17:21: crazy but just like making experiences where you\n17:24: can have a human to human relationship before\n17:28: you start adding other ideas about like oh so what problems are you having?\n17:31: Let me design something for you. Or however the conversation goes\n17:35: is creating a context where there's a regular experience of humanity\n17:39: and connection and so What I\n17:42: did was I turned my house into a co living space.\n17:46: And initially, you know, we would do little events related\n17:51: to storytelling and food and you know,\n17:56: years go on. And at some point he's like my co founder and we're like\n17:59: living together and it grows from there. And I guess the\n18:03: other element of that is don't rush it. So anybody\n18:07: else want to share a little bit about, like, what does this slide\n18:11: mean for them or how does it resonate with them? I'm kind of curious how\n18:14: people take this. This prompt.\n18:17: Yeah. Inclusivity. Bottom. Okay.\n18:21: Zachary, is prototyping with people a little behind in technology?\n18:25: Okay, interesting. Yeah, absolutely.\n18:28: Means go ahead. Yeah, I'll say\n18:32: prototyping in marginalized or with marginalized people mean\n18:38: prototyping a project with or designing\n18:41: a project with people that are excluded from\n18:45: economic, political or social reasons.\n18:48: And so at this point, you're prototyping to understand or to\n18:52: address the real challenges that the people in that community are facing.\n18:56: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. This idea of the\n19:00: real challenges that people are facing,\n19:03: how do you think you can get access to that?\n19:06: How do you think you can really identify those challenges?\n19:11: Maureen or anybody else?\n19:26: Go ahead, Alexandra. And then, and then Maureen, if you want to follow up.\n19:31: No, on that note, I just wanted. I kind of went\n19:35: through that process already when I traveled to the northeast of India.\n19:39: And on that note of understanding what the real\n19:43: issue is, I think often with like college educated people,\n19:46: we have like a preconception of what the problem probably\n19:50: is and what has to be done. But I think this\n19:53: is really the first step to lose that preconception and first of all\n19:58: become like a humble listener and really just\n20:02: listen and don't say anything and just try to take\n20:05: it in and then later on to react. And I think for me at\n20:09: least, that was like a big lesson I learned. And I think this is\n20:13: really something every process needs. If you really want to\n20:17: work on a real problem and not show something just on your head.\n20:20: Yeah, yeah. Could you actually tell us maybe one of the\n20:24: things that you learned and maybe a short story about it,\n20:28: in short. So I got invited by university\n20:32: to northeast India, in Assam,\n20:35: to a city called Guwahati. And the idea was to\n20:39: analyze the traditional architecture and come up with new\n20:43: social housing ideas. And of course\n20:46: I was really like\n20:50: impacted by my education and like sustain sustainable thoughts\n20:54: of like, the different practices and how things\n20:58: should be happen, especially coming from Europe. But then\n21:02: once I started to talk to people, there are way more social\n21:06: and cultural reasonings also behind things they're doing,\n21:11: like also of choosing certain building typologies.\n21:15: So then often what I did is, was trying to get to\n21:18: these people that are on this transition and like just talking\n21:22: with them how they feel about their building right now. How do they\n21:25: feel about getting information? Okay, you're building this now,\n21:29: why you're doing it in terms of construction, but also\n21:33: how it works in the, in the community there\n21:36: in what is the impact? And slowly\n21:40: through that, getting a better picture. That was a bit. The process.\n21:45: Yeah, yeah. One of the core things that I heard you talk about was\n21:49: how you feel and the word feeling came up a couple\n21:53: of times and yeah, I think.\n21:57: Have you. Yeah, I think this idea of letting go\n22:01: of what you know, to listen enough\n22:05: so that you can hear how things can be different.\n22:09: Right. You know,\n22:12: the challenge is I'm going to just put up the slide. I wasn't going to\n22:15: do it initially, I was going to do it at a later time. But this\n22:18: idea of what we know, what we\n22:21: learn. So I study computer programming and almost every time I see a\n22:25: problem, I'm like, oh, let's make an app. You know, like,\n22:28: how many, how many times have you guys, like, especially people that use apps all\n22:32: the time, like, you come up with a problem and you're like, oh my God,\n22:35: like this should be an app where you can like push a button and you\n22:38: know your facilitation, you just put what's next on the slide and\n22:42: some kind of app. I don't know, like for me, because of what I studied\n22:45: and what I learned and what I know, I come with a\n22:49: bunch of perspectives and I think what you were sharing about\n22:53: feelings and connecting with feelings as\n22:56: the beginning of a design process is really important.\n23:00: And this is going to be not\n23:04: controversial, going to be a challenge. I'm going to challenge everybody here.\n23:08: It's. It's okay. Who wants to hear one of my, one of my big\n23:11: failures, like in my life, like failures that\n23:15: I keep confronting in my life over and over.\n23:18: Anybody willing, you want to hear how an almost 40 year\n23:21: old dude just like keeps making stupid mistakes?\n23:26: My stupid mistakes happen because I\n23:30: don't listen deeply enough and\n23:34: change what I'm doing based on feedback. And pivoting\n23:38: is scary. Pivoting is hard.\n23:41: Changing your idea is extremely difficult because you're so\n23:44: invested. You know, you put in so much time and effort and money. Let's say\n23:48: you produce something, you worked on something for ages. I get,\n23:52: I'm a very nostalgic person. I have like this kind of this feeling of like,\n23:55: oh my God, no, I can't let this go. It's, it's so important.\n23:59: We like, we wrote all this code. Can we actually throw\n24:02: away all this code? And sometimes it's the right thing to do.\n24:06: So this is what I'm going to try to flip for you guys.\n24:10: The solution should be the less important part of\n24:14: this like prototyping thing. The thing that we're going to\n24:17: be learning more is the courage to love and\n24:21: to care enough to solve the real problem\n24:25: and to listen well enough to hear what this real problem is.\n24:29: And I hope that's something that I can\n24:33: learn. I don't know how. Does anybody have any ideas\n24:36: about that actually? Like, what advice would you give me? I built something,\n24:41: right? I spent a long time working on it and coding it\n24:44: and it doesn't get much traction. Like it doesn't seem like people really\n24:48: want to be using it and I'm not listening enough to\n24:52: either change it or even do something else. What would you tell me?\n24:55: Okay, go ahead, Maureen. I didn't think it was going to be a therapy session\n24:58: today. I'm sorry, Nihal. Like I'm taking over the workshop\n25:02: and turning into my own personal therapy session. But I hope it's useful for others.\n25:05: Marine, go ahead. Yeah, I wanted to\n25:08: mention that there's part of our.\n25:12: In Module 5 we were talk about something called cognitive bias\n25:15: and in there they something to do with sun cost fallacy.\n25:19: So I think that is probably something they're experiencing where you insist\n25:23: on a specific project because you've already invested a lot of resources into it.\n25:27: So maybe it's a bias that you need to like look into and try and\n25:30: find ways to overcome it. Yeah, yeah. The sunk cost fallacy\n25:34: is definitely strong with me. I'm curious how,\n25:38: Ricardo, how would you suggest I let go of the sunk cost\n25:41: fallacy?\n25:45: Well, I had a similar situation before my project,\n25:50: this project I had a project of over three years.\n25:53: We had pretending we were almost in the\n25:59: contract side of making contracts already getting\n26:03: customers. But things\n26:07: happened and I wasn't able to continue with it. And I was like\n26:12: it was really dragging me down.\n26:15: I was able to realize that. So what I did is\n26:19: look where my project was useful\n26:25: for someone else and in this case it was\n26:28: a friend of mine that he wasn't interested\n26:32: really in the project per se, but he wasn't able to\n26:35: make one himself to get into property he wanted.\n26:44: That was like easier for me to let go that way.\n26:48: It clipped a little Bit at the end.\n26:52: Can you, can you just say the end or write it? I'm not sure if\n26:55: it was just for me or for everyone. Oh, well, I,\n26:58: I, sorry. I have, I,\n27:02: like my friends, got the job based on my thanks to my that project.\n27:06: And that was like easier for me to let go,\n27:09: like knowing it was useful even though I\n27:12: no longer work with it directly. Okay,\n27:16: so seeing it like continue out in the world somewhere helps\n27:20: you kind of let go of you needing to do it yourself, but like\n27:24: having it live on. I think that's a beautiful idea and it's\n27:27: actually very useful, very helpful for me.\n27:30: Georgina, is that how you pronounce your name?\n27:34: Yes, it's Georgia. Welcome.\n27:38: Thank you. So whenever I'm in such a situation,\n27:42: I, I have a group of\n27:45: friends. So whenever I'm in a situation where I\n27:49: don't know whether to move forward with something, I feel like this idea maybe\n27:53: doesn't make sense. Having doubts. I call\n27:57: them and I'm like, look, please just tell me the truth. This is\n28:00: where I'm at. This is what has happened. This is everything.\n28:04: Just tell me the truth. Am I wasting my time? Should I continue?\n28:08: And I found that having those few friends who\n28:12: tell you, yeah, this is good, this is crap\n28:16: just helps because they are very honest. And sometimes getting\n28:21: honesty from someone you know that is cares\n28:24: about you and your project help to get some clarity on\n28:28: your way forward. Absolutely,\n28:30: absolutely. And it reminds me of this quote that I\n28:34: had prepared. The shortest distance\n28:38: between truth and a human being is a story.\n28:42: And so I thought what we could do is\n28:46: get into breakouts and actually, you know\n28:49: what, what I'll do first is I wanted to also go through\n28:53: an example of a time where I\n28:57: think I did it a little bit better in\n29:00: another facilitation. So who am I? My name is Vidal Ghalib.\n29:05: I've had some experience with being\n29:08: a part of different hackathons and camps\n29:12: around sustainability. I've, you know, I used to build my own\n29:16: robots for recycling and then worked with\n29:20: community spaces around the world. I moved from building to\n29:23: creating communities of people around me and being\n29:28: a part of these groups that were thinking about challenges and\n29:32: you know, working on open source solutions and creating projects\n29:36: and at some point businesses. I currently run an\n29:40: accelerator program in Lebanon called Bloom Bloom\n29:44: pm where we're trying to bring in personal development and professional\n29:47: development and really show that it's one and the same. That as\n29:51: you grow as a person, what you can grow through, your organizations\n29:55: are symbiotic and synergistic. They actually work together.\n29:59: So that's kind of where I'm at today.\n30:02: And one of the projects though, that I did a long time\n30:05: ago now, back in 2014, we were running\n30:09: a lot of hackathons. Has anybody been in a hackathon before?\n30:12: Or like, yeah, okay, so I got a couple hands, I got a couple\n30:15: of nods. Okay, great. So a hackathon is like, okay, let's solve a problem.\n30:19: Here's the. Let's, you know, let's talk about water. You guys want to solve like\n30:22: a water problem. There's a couple of water people here. And let's do three days,\n30:26: go Internet research, make a prototype present.\n30:29: And I started really realizing that it wasn't connecting much\n30:33: with people. People weren't really able\n30:38: to talk to people and understand their problems with water access\n30:41: or the bigger context because hackathons\n30:45: are so fast. And so I proposed and\n30:48: I got some support\n30:52: to run a month long session where we called it\n30:55: DIY sustainability. And it was all about building relationships\n30:59: between people that could create stuff,\n31:02: right? They, they were the hackers, the makers. They have like laser cutters and I\n31:05: don't know what, and people with real challenges in the\n31:09: local communities. And so this\n31:13: is just some slides from one of the teams that were there.\n31:16: They called themselves city growers. And city Growers\n31:21: basically takes unused lots in, in the\n31:24: Boston area and they turned them into farms.\n31:28: So it's taking a problem,\n31:32: which is blight and empty spots inside of a\n31:35: city and it turns them into food because often cities are food deserts.\n31:39: This happens a lot where I grew up in Michigan,\n31:43: in metro Detroit and in the Detroit area. And what\n31:47: they did really well though was actually going and asking\n31:51: them their real challenges. And so they were\n31:55: talking about how much they're spending on weeding. They talked about\n31:58: like how expensive seeds are increasing crop yields.\n32:02: And they did like this team in particular, I think they\n32:05: called themselves Team Wasabi. I don't know why. Got really, really good\n32:09: at getting them to share more of their\n32:13: problems. And at some point they get into\n32:17: the solution side of things. But I'm not even gonna focus on the solution side\n32:20: of things like this. Like we mentioned earlier, it's not as\n32:23: important as this slide, which is after making the\n32:27: solutions, they go and they present them and\n32:30: they continue to get feedback. And this is going to be an important thing.\n32:34: Some people are kind of early in their journey for their,\n32:37: their projects and people seem to already have a prototype.\n32:40: But no matter where you are, this idea of being\n32:44: able to let it all go based on real authentic feedback\n32:48: means that it's more connected to truth and people and\n32:52: goodness. And yeah, it kind of looks like this,\n32:56: right? Like where there's food and people\n32:59: and paper and stories and sharing and\n33:02: it's a very different way of thinking about creating and creating solutions.\n33:07: So what I, what I wanted to\n33:10: do, I don't know, it's my dad. I'm gonna turn that off and\n33:14: close this. Okay, Sorry about that, guys. Let me just.\n33:17: Yeah, I think it's closed. Yeah. What I wanted to do is get\n33:22: people to connect and to share the\n33:26: challenge and to share the story. So not just\n33:30: like what the problem is, but I also want to know why\n33:34: does it matter to you? And one brave\n33:38: person then breakouts means is there somebody who\n33:41: didn't share yet willing to go first of\n33:46: the problem, that they. Of the things that they see\n33:49: in the world tell the story in a way that can help us\n33:53: see what you see and then tell us why does it matter to you?\n33:56: And then we're going to go into breakouts where everyone can do it.\n33:59: But is there a volunteer?\n34:05: Hillary.\n34:11: Hi.\n34:15: Yeah, so my name is Hillary and I think I'll just\n34:18: try and make this quick. Yeah.\n34:22: So a number of us are able to recall\n34:26: a Covid period and during that\n34:31: period we found ourselves at an intersection where I\n34:35: was out of school and we\n34:39: are at home. But then because of our prevailing\n34:44: circumstances, we realized that we are\n34:47: not really able to get access to what you call energy\n34:52: security. So in this sense it means that when you\n34:56: want to prepare your meals, then you are unable to\n34:59: do so. And then it\n35:03: went so bad to the extent that now we had to like ensure that\n35:07: we cooked in open fires by 6pm\n35:12: simply because it will be raining from\n35:16: 6pm and then, so when\n35:20: I, when I faced this challenge, then I thought to myself,\n35:24: how many more people have to\n35:28: undergo the inconveniences\n35:32: of having trouble accessing a clean\n35:36: and an affordable cooking solution?\n35:40: And that is where now it moved from me\n35:44: thinking about getting money to buy what is already there in the market\n35:48: to try and change the narrative\n35:51: or the situation, not just for myself,\n35:54: but for others as well. Yes. And my\n36:00: idea, or rather how I went to go about\n36:04: this is I went back to school\n36:08: and now with a couple of other friends,\n36:11: we tried to bring a portable biodigester\n36:16: so that people are able to make use of\n36:20: organic waste which is around them in the remote villages.\n36:24: So this will mean animal waste, this would\n36:28: mean the food waste. And then I was like, hey,\n36:31: Wait a minute. This is still limited because we are only serving\n36:36: those who are in the, in the remote areas, who are in\n36:40: the villages, and not necessarily those who are within\n36:45: the, the informal urban areas, which is where\n36:49: a number of people right now are, because at the\n36:52: outside, at the outside areas of\n36:56: the urban areas. And they are unique because\n36:59: yes, they, they are looking for access to opportunities, but are still.\n37:04: Are still limited in terms of their social\n37:08: and economic, I'd say, abilities and demographics.\n37:12: And that is now what is leading me to try and think\n37:16: of other ways that we are able to ensure that clean\n37:21: and affordable cooking solutions become affordable\n37:25: generally to those who are at the base of\n37:29: the pyramid. Yeah. Okay. Beautiful. Hillary.\n37:33: My, my favorite part started when you said,\n37:36: hey, wait a minute, because I could see that you cared.\n37:40: Okay. And this is, this is a message for everybody.\n37:44: I want to figure out when you go into these breakout rooms,\n37:47: like, why you care. And hopefully\n37:52: this isn't a storytelling workshop, but when you tell\n37:55: the story, if you can tell people's names. For instance, when I shared\n37:58: my story about Saleh and he grew up in a refugee camp in Syria\n38:02: and I met him in Lebanon and we moved into this house together,\n38:06: I kind of went over the story a little bit quickly because I didn't want\n38:08: to linger too much on it. But, you know, help people see\n38:12: what you see so that they can care. When you\n38:15: talk about the challenge with the cooking\n38:19: and these, the issues, I couldn't\n38:23: feel it personally because, first of all, I haven't\n38:26: experienced it, so maybe it's a little bit easier for others\n38:30: that might be able to imagine the problem. But paint a picture,\n38:34: give us names, show. Show what happens to people in this\n38:39: and then, and then especially, like, why it matters to\n38:42: you. So this is what I'm hoping for everyone to do when they're in the\n38:45: breakouts. So this is like a storytelling time. I'm going to pick\n38:49: on some people to, to share the.\n38:53: Their partner's story, not their story. So you need to be listening\n38:57: to your partner because I'm going to ask somebody to share what their partner\n39:00: said. And my, my, my hope is that you'll be able to\n39:04: tell us, like, something that they don't know about themselves. Like,\n39:08: wow, my part, the person who shared, he's a\n39:11: really, like, sweethearted person and he actually really loves whatever\n39:15: X, Y or Z, because I saw it in his story.\n39:18: So please go talk about the challenge that\n39:21: you guys are looking at, the people that you want\n39:25: to design for and help tell a story\n39:28: that shows another Person why it matters to you. So I'm\n39:32: going to open up some breakout rooms.\n39:36: Nihal and Joyce, do you guys want to hop into our room too?\n39:39: You guys can participate or you guys want to. We can stop\n39:43: by and see how they're doing. Okay. So how big do you want the groups\n39:46: to be below? I'd like it too pairs.\n39:50: Oh, just two. Okay. I'd suggest three because sometimes\n39:54: people drop off because of that connection. Okay.\n39:57: And would that. Would that work? No worries.\n40:00: I'm gonna. It's gonna be. Or we can do two in\n40:04: case somebody drops out. Then come back to the main room and I'll read\n40:08: us reassign you. Yeah, no worries. I. I set it up to two\n40:11: to three. It'll be mostly three. Maybe one, one group of two,\n40:15: and hopefully everyone. Have you set it up already? I'm about to hit go,\n40:18: but. Oh, okay, cool. Let's do it. Okay. Yallah. And yeah,\n40:23: so try to take around. What time\n40:26: is it? Yeah, take. Take three minutes\n40:30: each and we'll come back in around six to seven minutes.\n40:33: Okay. I know it's not very, very long to tell\n40:37: a good and deep story, but try to remember to get to\n40:41: names, feelings, why things matter for you and share your\n40:45: problem and I will see you guys soon.\n40:50: Okay. That won't work. Recording stopped.\n40:58: Is it open up? People moving?\n41:03: Yeah, yeah, people are just starting to go.\n41:06: Okay, great. So you guys. Okay, I'll get a timer up.\n41:21: We have some active people and then some\n41:25: maybe on their phones or something, but so\n41:28: far so good.\n41:44: Thank you, Fiona. Actually, I didn't read that yet.\n41:47: This idea of the only permanent thing in the world is change.\n41:51: That's a good one.\n42:00: You wanna. You guys want to hop into some rooms? I'm gonna see and just\n42:03: make sure people are doing all right. Yeah, I'm stalking\n42:07: now. Okay. From the progress\n42:11: chart, it's stalking time. Yes.\n42:14: See you guys here in bed. See, Kimberly.\n42:19: Okay, here we go. I'll jump into this one.\n42:22: Right.\n42:26: They started off solution based,\n42:29: whereby I knew that my problem\n42:33: was the use of kerosene lamps in\n42:37: communities where they relied on it as light\n42:40: energy sources. So I was like, the best thing I can do is\n42:44: provide them with lamps. But then going into\n42:48: these communities and seeing the problems that they were facing,\n42:52: they were not interested in adopting solar lamps\n42:56: because they want to save the environment. They are stricken with\n42:59: poverty. They have things that they value more at\n43:03: the moment than saving the environment.\n43:07: So getting into the community and imaging myself\n43:11: in these people's experiences. Yes. The constant Use of\n43:15: kerosene does make them susceptible to\n43:19: fire hazards, some health hazards, and you know, eventually also\n43:23: indoor, indoor air pollution and outdoor.\n43:26: And I also realized that poverty was one of the biggest problems\n43:31: they were facing. So what I thought of\n43:34: was creating an entrepreneurial loop. What are their strengths?\n43:39: So I realized that women are women and children who\n43:43: are currently in school are the people who actually really need\n43:46: light, especially at night. And I\n43:50: was like, let me bring them into the energy space. It's usually very male\n43:54: dominated. So how can I teach women to be local artisans\n43:58: to make these lamps and be the ambassadors of\n44:02: helping people within the community to transition to cleaner\n44:07: and affordable energy sources?\n44:10: So that's now what my project is focused on,\n44:14: bringing women into the energy space, teaching them how to make these solar\n44:18: lamps and then I'm selling it.\n44:21: But then the model that I want to sell is through like lamps with stories,\n44:25: attaching stories behind every lamps. So my target\n44:28: base when it comes to selling is the upper middle class and the rich.\n44:32: And then for every lump that is sold, one is donated\n44:36: to underserved areas. That way we're creating\n44:40: that sort of connection and inter, like an entrepreneurial\n44:44: loop where one community strength fits into another one that's\n44:48: able to afford and get on, that makes. And then that cycle continues like\n44:52: that and like that. Like that. Yeah, yeah,\n44:55: that's, that's really, that's really beautiful.\n44:58: Sorry, I'm hopping between each room.\n45:03: Yeah, no, I just want to know, Sorry, I didn't catch\n45:07: it. Where exactly your location to do\n45:11: that? Sorry. Oh, so currently it's\n45:15: in Kenya, Nairobi. But I'm going to be focusing on the outskirt\n45:18: areas where the it's usually off grid areas.\n45:22: They do not have access to electricity at all and they are heavily dependent\n45:26: on the use of kerosene lamps.\n45:29: So these lamps are also going to be made using recycled materials.\n45:33: So I want to also employ the circular economy principles\n45:38: in this. Oh yeah, yeah. Thank you.\n45:42: All in Kenya. Okay. So it's really great.\n45:45: It's beautiful. You love.\n45:48: It's very beautiful. And so one of the questions that popped\n45:51: up for me sort of because I'm a little bit curious about,\n45:57: you know, I saw your process of going and being like, okay, I want to\n46:00: bring this lamp will like solve all of these issues\n46:04: from fire hazards and indoor air pollution. But first of all, people have\n46:08: bigger and more pressing needs because of poverty.\n46:12: And you went to this idea of entrepreneurship\n46:16: and entrepreneurship support. And the\n46:20: question is, could it be something\n46:25: else? Like why focus only on the\n46:29: lamps if the real problem that you\n46:32: moved into solving is into jobs.\n46:37: Are there more scalable, easier, more abundant,\n46:41: more relevant jobs that you\n46:45: would rather be supporting? I, I don't mean to be pushing.\n46:48: Maybe I shouldn't even do this right here because it's supposed to be a storytelling\n46:51: session rather than the, the pivot session.\n46:54: But the idea is to be a little bit less held on to our initial\n46:58: idea and to see what the other ones could possibly be. Not that I don't\n47:01: like it. I think it's actually pretty cool. The strategy, the storytelling,\n47:04: the connection between places, the market,\n47:07: innovation as well. And. Yeah.\n47:10: So congrats. I'm gonna let Niram share\n47:14: a little bit about what she's doing and the problem of flooding\n47:18: in her house. And I'll see you\n47:22: guys back in the main room in a bit. Okay,\n47:25: thank you. Thank you.\n47:33: Feeding the hungaries and come back\n47:36: home with food. And being that it wasn't too much,\n47:39: she'll just give the kids food and the husband and she'll decide not to eat\n47:43: or probably take a very small portion. And most of the time,\n47:46: you know, it will be aligned like health issues, she'll get sick\n47:50: and stuff like that. It was very challenging for me to\n47:54: watch. And so I have always grown in a passion of ensuring that every\n47:58: household has food because I don't, I don't believe that fair for someone to go\n48:01: hungry. Yeah, it's supposed to be a right for everybody. And so\n48:05: during my work, my work experiences,\n48:10: I have worked with marginalized communities that are facing exactly the same situation because\n48:16: the mother will sacrifice and she goes to an extent of even marrying\n48:20: off their kids because she cannot provide for that kid. So she was\n48:23: to see how can I help these families by helping them put food to their\n48:27: table. And so I chose a community in the\n48:30: northern parts of Kenya.\n48:35: Then he will have\n48:39: got in. Yes,\n48:43: he will have. The prices of his produce will be four\n48:46: times less than he will have getting the seas.\n48:50: So that's why he choose to go wake up\n48:54: every morning, every day at 2am and return home\n48:58: and barely asleep. And I just saw his hard work\n49:02: every day. And I just, and I just saw the\n49:05: situation that for farmers and producers it's so hard sometimes\n49:10: to get good profits and clean\n49:15: energy resources in the Assad regions of Kenya. And to\n49:19: address that, I was trying to come up with like\n49:23: a community owned solar farms,\n49:26: solar plants, that is. And for\n49:29: the prototyping, I was maybe trying to think, should I,\n49:33: am I even in a position to come up with a simple, a Simpler\n49:37: version of a solar farm that requires some financial investment.\n49:42: So to address that, since I'm trying to\n49:46: cut on the cost because the initial acquisition cost is the major problem\n49:50: the community. I'm intending to serve a person.\n49:53: My venture course just gave me a hint\n49:56: that maybe I can try to come up with something like a financial model\n50:01: to finance the acquisition of the product.\n50:04: And then from the model I can share it with respective a\n50:08: few of the community members based on the way I'll be sampling\n50:11: them. I share with them and then I get their feedback\n50:16: based on my proposed financial model.\n50:20: Yes, I think it's a good idea because I also experience\n50:25: the same thing. I'm also at\n50:28: the prototyping so\n50:33: I'm trying to solve.\n50:37: So so far what I've noticed\n50:41: to do my prototype. Yeah, I can do it.\n50:47: I already have a structure in mind.\n50:51: I did all the calculations because.\n51:11: All right,\n\nWill add the rest next",

A few people dropped out\n51:36: so I had to reassign them. Sneaky coffee.\n51:40: Snack break. Oh yeah, people want\n51:44: a snack break.\n51:47: Okay, so welcome back everybody.\n51:51: I will again go back to sharing actually.\n51:55: Yeah, let's. Let's see people's faces first. Let's just\n51:58: wait for everyone to come back.\n52:04: Hello. Hello. Welcome back. It's great to\n52:08: see videos on. That means that you guys had your videos on when you were\n52:10: in the breakouts. I went into some of the breakouts\n52:14: and I heard some impassioned people telling\n52:18: some incredible stories. I'm really honored actually just to\n52:22: be a part of this amazing initiative that's gathered together\n52:26: such beautiful people.\n52:29: I heard. I don't even remember recording in progress. Welcome back\n52:33: everybody. I hope you guys heard some beautiful stories.\n52:37: I just popped into some of the rooms and I heard some incredible things.\n52:40: One moment that, you know, stood out to me was\n52:45: somebody was saying it was really challenging for me to\n52:48: see. And then. And the way that\n52:52: it was said, you knew that it was felt and\n52:56: that they were talking about food and how food is a right for\n52:59: everybody and they were impassioned. And the reason why\n53:03: I'm kind of emphasizing this, the storytelling and\n53:06: this feeling part is because solving\n53:11: a real problem is really hard and it takes a long\n53:14: time and to get to\n53:18: a. You know,\n53:21: I think it's a Friedrich Nietzsche quote. He goes,\n53:24: he who has a strong enough why\n53:29: can overcome any. How have you guys heard this quote?\n53:34: And this is it, this feeling. Who here got into\n53:37: a feeling mode, put up like some reaction. Do we have\n53:42: reactions? Got to a feeling sharing your stories.\n53:45: Anybody? Okay, great. Bill Bhavan.\n53:49: Ricardo, definitely the lady who was talking when I was in her\n53:53: room. Jessica. Priya.\n53:56: Priya. Oh, my God.\n53:59: Priyaranjan.\n54:01: Priyaranjan. Okay, I'm terribly sorry. Let me know how\n54:04: to pronounce it better. Or you can call me Bolbol. You should put your little\n54:08: nickname at the end of your name if you have one. Okay,\n54:11: great. So for the people listening to the stories,\n54:15: who thinks they can share what\n54:19: makes their partner come alive, this is it.\n54:23: This is the reason why we're doing this, is to get these stories,\n54:27: because I really believe this quote from\n54:31: Howard that what the world really\n54:35: needs are people that come alive. Not necessarily this\n54:39: idea of how to make a better world, because when you're.\n54:42: When you come alive, you are a part of that better world. So who\n54:46: wants to share a story and maybe highlight where their\n54:50: partner came alive? Feel free, raise your hand. You can share your partner's story.\n54:57: All right, well, Ricardo went a couple of times, so I'm going to look for\n55:00: a couple more hands. Charity, would you like to share? Not that I\n55:04: don't want to hear from Ricardo. We'll hear from you again. I keep raising\n55:07: your hand. Charity, please feel free.\n55:11: Okay, thank you. So I'm going to share the\n55:16: moment where my partner kids\n55:21: that one. He gave a case scenario of\n55:25: her mother, who is a farmer and. And works\n55:29: in the farm from. From morning to.\n55:32: To evening. And since that is around the problem\n55:36: he's trying to solve, you know, working with farmers and.\n55:39: And farmers. Most of their. Most of the farmers in their community are\n55:43: women. So the fact that he gave an\n55:47: example of the mother and how she was diagnosed with some\n55:51: issue that. That is when he came up with a. With an idea\n55:55: of I can solve this problem. I really felt that. Yeah.\n55:59: So the. The story was connected to a personal\n56:03: family connection. And I think this is one of the.\n56:07: The best places to work on designing\n56:11: a challenge around is the thing that you know the best, the thing that's,\n56:14: like, really that close to you that it matters to you. It's your\n56:18: family even, that is confronted by the problem.\n56:21: So beautiful. And I can't hear. Wait to hear\n56:25: more about the challenge. Chetan, Inshallah Priyaranjan.\n56:31: Feel free to go and share your partner's story. Oh, actually,\n56:35: actually, real quick, Chetan, did she get it right?\n56:42: Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay. I could.\n56:46: Or projects. I could feel relatable. So.\n56:50: Yeah. Okay. Wonderful, wonderful. We're gonna do that\n56:53: because this is, this is the, the process of kind of validating\n56:58: your listening. So Priya Ranjan, feel free to go ahead and\n57:02: share what your. Your partner's story and what made them come alive.\n57:06: Yeah, like I just want to apologize that I\n57:10: forgot my partner name. So like\n57:13: I was so much into his story. So basically he told me\n57:17: how he went to his friend house and the way he saw that his friends\n57:21: is a farmer. He is, he is.\n57:24: He used to grow pineapples and he\n57:28: have to wake up like around. He used to wake up at around 2am in\n57:31: the morning and he have to sell his product.\n57:35: And like after doing so much hard work, there were multiple\n57:38: middlemans. Because of that he was not able to get the fair price.\n57:42: So he has been working on thinking of like\n57:46: how he can eliminate those middlemen\n57:49: and how he can get his, like get\n57:53: the farmers to get the right price of their product and\n57:57: how they can connect them with the companies and organization which can\n58:00: also provide them tools and the machineries. So what I understood\n58:04: from his. So that was something was\n58:08: like very connected, something with his personal experience\n58:12: because he has stayed with his friend and he has seen the\n58:17: journey. So he really understands the core problem\n58:20: and the problem they are facing throughout the years from growing the\n58:24: product to selling in the market and still not getting the fair price.\n58:28: So all right, what would you say, your unnamed\n58:32: partner, what is a value that they hold that\n58:36: made them care?\n58:39: So I think the value they hold,\n58:43: the struggle which they have seen like after doing\n58:47: like, you know, from scratch. Because farmers are the root\n58:52: which is like you know, producing the product and\n58:56: in the end of the day if they are not earning enough.\n58:59: So it will, there will be a time when, you know,\n59:02: farmers would be looking for other opportunities and that\n59:06: is going to create a struggle for whole, whole world.\n59:10: I say because if we will not produce so\n59:14: we cannot sell, we cannot get like everything. The whole system,\n59:17: the chain starts from farmers and the whole system\n59:21: will get destroyed. So in the end of the day someone get\n59:24: paid or not. The farmer who is growing, putting months\n59:28: in and you know, developing the product,\n59:31: struggling to get us the right product.\n59:35: If he's not getting paid, then it is going to create a problem.\n59:39: So I think that was the main value, core value. All right,\n59:42: unnamed partner, could you name yourself and tell us did\n59:47: he get the story right and do you think the\n59:50: value was right as well?\n59:55: Yes, sure. My name\n59:58: is Anges. So yes, he got the story just\n60:03: as I told it and it was really good to hear from\n60:06: him and also the value he told was\n60:11: very well. Right. Yeah. Did you\n60:15: learn something from the stuff that stood out to\n60:18: him? And did you learn from hearing how somebody else tells your story?\n60:23: What, what did you learn hearing that?\n60:30: Well, I,\n60:34: I learned to.\n60:42: I learned that I learned from hearing\n60:46: the way he told my story that what\n60:56: I learned, just so you see, is that he was\n61:00: so impassioned that he started going off talking about\n61:04: how farmers are the root of everything in the world. And like he's\n61:07: going to do your project for you now, like maybe you found a team member.\n61:11: So I think that's, that's one of the things that I noticed is your\n61:15: story was moving and moving enough to really light\n61:19: a fire for Priya Ranjan as well.\n61:23: Yeah, that's right. I, I did.\n61:26: So the way that he told the story with Bashan, it was\n61:29: very. Yeah. Motivating.\n61:33: Yeah. And we need each other like this, this way of seeing\n61:36: each other is really beautiful. So maybe we can get another story\n61:40: or two. Let's see if people are excited to share. Anybody want to share a\n61:45: story that they think was really powerful?\n61:53: Good one, Good one. Nyasha.\n62:01: Anybody want to share another story from. From one of their part?\n62:11: Otherwise, do you want to. Oh, go ahead, go ahead. Who is saying\n62:15: that? So I had two\n62:19: partners. I was with Bill and\n62:24: Gucci. Yeah, with Bill, he spoke\n62:28: about water contamination. Forgive the\n62:32: background noises. He spoke about contamination,\n62:36: something that's close to him as he isn't comfortable with\n62:40: seeing people drinking unsafe water. And he also\n62:44: realized that bottled water is\n62:47: quite expensive. So he came up with a safer drinking,\n62:51: safe drinking water with through solar powered water purifiers.\n62:56: And he also tested his prototype and the user experience\n63:00: yesterday and he says it was a big success.\n63:03: And then with Kuc, it was about SDGs.\n63:07: And her root is the educational\n63:12: teaching and finding games to get people to be hands\n63:16: on, on what to do. She started having\n63:20: this passion for it when she\n63:23: was a volunteer and she noticed that sustainable.\n63:28: She noticed a sustainable need for stock market,\n63:32: which wasn't taught in school. So with her it was a thing of\n63:36: she's getting to learn about something, but she also wants\n63:39: to teach more people about it because she realizes that people are not\n63:43: knowledgeable in that aspect, me and Bill included as well.\n63:47: We wish we learned a lot about stuff in\n63:51: school, high school, university, wherever, before we actually\n63:54: came to fellowship programs. That way it would be way easier\n63:57: to understand sustainability stuff because we actually learned about it.\n64:01: So that's where her story came\n64:05: from. She wanted to Understand the problem as well.\n64:08: I hope I said it well. Yeah. And we're gonna figure\n64:11: that out now, Bill.\n64:14: And who was the other partner?\n64:19: Hello.\n64:22: You can write it in the chat. Bill. Did she get it?\n64:26: Yes, she did. People in\n64:30: sub Saharan Africa really don't have access to safe drinking\n64:34: water. And especially people in the\n64:37: rural areas, they drink from these open water\n64:41: sources, which are always so contaminated and they usually\n64:46: have to walk such long distances to get safe drinking water.\n64:51: So we wanted to help alleviate\n64:54: the financial burden of having to use chemicals to\n64:57: disinfect their water and having to go through the hassle of boiling\n65:02: and purchasing bottled water by using solar,\n65:05: which is available everywhere, to give them safe drinking\n65:09: water. And what we saw was\n65:13: it may not seem like such a big problem for us who are living in\n65:16: the urban areas, because water is almost everywhere.\n65:20: But when you do go to the rural areas and you find out that\n65:23: people walk almost every 5 kilometers just to fetch\n65:27: a 20 liter, 5 liter jerry can of unsafe drinking\n65:31: water, that is when you know it's really a problem.\n65:35: Yeah. I'm curious as someone, it sounds like you're saying that you\n65:39: live in an urban area. I, I understand, you know,\n65:43: if I imagine somebody walking that distance and I,\n65:47: I think about the problem of people getting sick from,\n65:50: from contaminated water, I can, I can feel something. But I'm\n65:54: wondering, how did it touch you to begin with? There's a lot of\n65:57: problems in the world, you know. You know, and why\n66:01: this one in particular? What was motivating,\n66:05: what actually motivated me was I was also getting\n66:09: sick from drinking tap water.\n66:14: But I got a volunteer job where we are, where we\n66:17: worked with refugees. And that's why I got\n66:20: to meet some of these people. They really struggled,\n66:23: especially when they were in transit. So I\n66:27: think I put those two experiences together and I thought,\n66:30: like, why can't we give them a sustainable way to have safe\n66:34: drinking water?\n66:37: Yeah, beautiful. Okay. So I'm writing down some principles in the chat\n66:41: based on the, the stories that I'm hearing and based on\n66:44: the, the, the things that really have been motivating\n66:48: you. And does anybody, Is anybody else finding\n66:52: other principles? You can feel free to put them in the chat.\n66:55: Bhavan. Yeah,\n66:59: So I met the person Lozi from South Africa.\n67:03: So that person, she was, I was able to relate\n67:07: to her because she also come from that rural background\n67:11: and the marginalized community. And I also come\n67:15: from that marginalized community. And my project is more or\n67:18: less with small and marginal farmers. And she,\n67:22: interestingly, was, was solving the problem of\n67:26: the the employment, youth employment by\n67:30: promoting the tourism, ecotourism.\n67:33: I think the, the value that it was, it was the empathetic.\n67:37: You know, she was feeling the problem of the community and she was\n67:41: as I was feeling. I was when she was telling about her story because she\n67:44: was the person who spoke first. But I was imagining myself\n67:49: being in that position. What I have been in that.\n67:52: Yeah. You know, the,\n67:54: the. The role of being very\n67:59: empathetic. Right. So understand the community first and the\n68:02: experiences she had. I think when she was telling,\n68:06: I. I thought. I literally thought that she also gone through that problem\n68:09: of, you know, shifting from rural to urban and what are the problems that youth\n68:12: face in this globalized, in the competitive world. And she really\n68:16: want to do something, you know, creating the employment, self employment,\n68:19: local level. And I think she is more passionate\n68:23: about. And looking at her, I felt that she is actually doing something really\n68:27: amazing in the community. So I think she holds\n68:30: the value of this empathetic and she, she can literally feel what she's going\n68:33: with the community. And she, she said that\n68:37: she's working as freelancer, you know, she edits, she writes and\n68:40: stuff. I think that she's an amazing person. She wonderful\n68:44: thing and. Yeah, all right. Wonderful.\n68:47: Does. Did. Did he get it,\n68:52: your partner? 100%. Thank you,\n68:55: Bhavan. That, that was really great.\n69:00: Well, when I just want to correct the ecotourism,\n69:03: it's community based tourism.\n69:08: Yeah. So I, I really appreciate\n69:12: him telling the story because he summarized it perfectly.\n69:16: Like my story was so long I didn't think he was gonna be\n69:20: able to get it. So. Yeah.\n69:23: And with me I also related\n69:27: to what he said about coming from\n69:31: a rural background where you know, you need\n69:34: to be the one who takes action. He said something like\n69:38: using local action for a global cause.\n69:42: And that really stood up, stood out for me and I'm\n69:46: really gonna use that in from now on\n69:50: going forward. Beautiful. Using local action.\n69:57: Okay, wonderful. I wanted to share a little bit\n70:01: actually. I don't know if Nihal wants to share this story, but of\n70:04: Proto village and Kalyan, do you want to tell his story a little\n70:08: bit? Because I feel like, you know, starting with the.\n70:11: The farmer and the two years, we can take a lot of principles from that\n70:15: that might be interesting and inspiring.\n70:19: Sure. I think some of these guys are aware of that.\n70:23: There's a. Oh yeah, some of them have even been there.\n70:28: Kalyan's daughter is a fellow as well and a couple of other folks from\n70:31: Proto. But in a nutshell, for those of you\n70:34: who don't know. A friend of ours,\n70:37: Kalyan, was. He came from a very\n70:40: small, impoverished village, one of the driest places in all\n70:45: of India, where you get very little rainfall,\n70:49: agriculture is very hard to do.\n70:51: And he was, and he was told as he\n70:55: was growing up that there's nothing for you here. Your future lies\n70:58: in the city. So educate yourself and go there. And when he went to the\n71:01: city and got a job in a tech company, he felt so empty\n71:06: and he was so frustrated that he was forced to leave his village for better\n71:09: opportunities. Opportunities and that for,\n71:12: for millennia, for centuries, villages used to\n71:16: be like a space for resilience,\n71:19: a space for abundance. But it has changed now and he wanted\n71:24: to bring that back. So one day he left everything behind and\n71:28: traveled for two and a half years across the lengths and breadths of India\n71:32: to tribal communities, to villages all over,\n71:36: just and without any money, without anything,\n71:39: just relying on their generosity and just sitting there and learning from\n71:42: them. And he comes back and he builds his own village based on\n71:46: his learnings. And this is what it is. And we\n71:50: have a few fellows as well who are, who live here and who\n71:53: are working to build this or make this community stronger.\n71:58: Yeah, and one of the things, I think, you know, we heard the word truth\n72:01: pop up a couple of times. Do you guys remember that?\n72:05: Like, somebody mentioned the idea of truth. And it's\n72:08: one of the things that I'm really proud of Kelly on for is\n72:13: he will sit with something and stick to\n72:17: something until the true\n72:21: and right thing to do appears.\n72:25: And he will iterate and he will change and he will\n72:29: let things go and do things over and over until\n72:32: the right thing appears. And I think that this\n72:36: example for those in India, if you haven't been to Proto Village,\n72:41: it's, it's a great example of what happens.\n72:45: And one of the other, what happens when, when you\n72:48: really listen deeply. So the, the way I remember his story is\n72:52: that he found the poorest farmer and\n72:56: he lived with him for two whole years to\n73:00: see, you know, instead of coming up with the idea because, you know,\n73:03: he came from a technical background, I think he was working for Oracle\n73:06: or some large tech company. And the\n73:11: initial idea potentially could have been, oh, you know what, let's use\n73:14: solar panels and modern technology and let's just solve all\n73:17: of the problems and, you know, let's get some,\n73:21: some better results from this poor farmer's land.\n73:24: And poor farmer, you know, he has all these problems, but he lived with him,\n73:27: he actually lived on the land with this farmer for two whole\n73:31: years and worked together in\n73:35: a collaborative approach to, I think,\n73:38: take his produce. He was the poorest farmer in the village\n73:42: and became the, the most abundant farmer in\n73:45: the village because they married the\n73:50: knowledge and the wisdom and the, the heritage that the farmer had\n73:53: with the, the ideas and the experience and the ability\n73:57: to use Google that Kelly on had, I'm sure,\n74:00: more than just that, but that, that led him\n74:04: to then see. So the idea is, you know,\n74:07: instead of saying, I want to set up this Proto village where, you know,\n74:11: villagers don't have to leave their homes, where they can take pride and, and solve\n74:14: the problem that he was feeling deeply, he spent,\n74:17: spent years validating his\n74:21: idea that there's this, you know,\n74:24: marriage between history and heritage\n74:28: and appropriate technology that can\n74:32: be truly beneficial in a way that it's accepted deeply\n74:36: within a community. So I really love Kelly on and I\n74:39: love learning from him all the time. And they're still at it\n74:43: and it's now onto the Next generation. I was calling him the other week and\n74:47: one of the things that he was mentioning to me was how\n74:51: they always try to have their learning for the young people in Proto\n74:54: Village be connected to something needed\n74:58: or valued. And so\n75:02: he was telling me how young people were learning some of the principles\n75:06: of thermodynamics. And then they\n75:10: started developing these thermally insulated bottles\n75:14: with just very, very basic and simple materials from like Coke cans\n75:18: or something because they realized that some of the people that\n75:21: were leaving had\n75:25: a problem like maintaining the heat inside of their food and their beverages\n75:29: when they would go out into the fields. And so the young people are,\n75:33: it's so cool to see, like, you do something in a\n75:36: good and beautiful way and it kind of inspires others.\n75:40: And it's like the next generation of people are kind of taking\n75:43: this, this approach forward. So I\n75:47: really love Proto Village. I really believe that they're doing some,\n75:50: some wonderful work. And I'm curious if\n75:54: anybody here has had a,\n75:58: a story like that where they had to do something\n76:01: different. I heard somebody in the chat talking about a pivot similar\n76:05: to how, you know, Kalyan was living in his corporate life and\n76:09: he pivoted and he like took his feelings seriously\n76:13: and did this deep exploration. Who here has a story about a\n76:17: pivot or a change from something to potentially\n76:20: what you're doing now?\n76:30: And if there's no pivot, let's hope that there is going to be\n76:33: one in the next few months. We'll see. Or even after the days. Oh,\n76:36: it's fadland. Alexander.\n76:40: I just remembered, after my bachelor in\n76:44: architecture, I worked in a big firm on some\n76:48: giant projects in China and Saudi Arabia.\n76:52: And it was that moment where I asked myself, like,\n76:55: is this really what I want to do as an architect?\n76:58: Like, make architecture just as a symbol of power\n77:02: and wealth without any meaning? Like, at the time, we were\n77:06: designing a racetrack in the middle of the desert.\n77:10: So it was mainly like a playground for rich people.\n77:15: And then at the same time,\n77:18: Francisque, an architect that I really enjoy from\n77:22: West Africa, won the Pritzker Award. And then his work,\n77:26: which is so linked to his culture and in\n77:30: his simplicity, also really innovative, really touched me.\n77:33: And I was like, that's like, so much more meaningful. I mean,\n77:37: maybe it's like a simple and small structure, but I felt like\n77:40: it touched me so much more than whatever shiny,\n77:44: giant building. And for me, this was like a pivotal\n77:48: moment where I was like, no, what I'm doing right now is not the right\n77:51: way. I. I have to change something.\n77:54: Yeah, beautiful.\n77:57: Okay, so we're going to do everyone type at the\n78:00: same time thing. I'm realizing that your story\n78:05: has another really important element of\n78:08: inspiration from somebody else that shows us that we can do things differently.\n78:12: So, for instance, Kalayan was a big inspiration\n78:16: for me. And actually the reason why I moved to Lebanon is because of this\n78:19: guy, this guy named Father Greg Boyle. I was trying\n78:23: to figure out, like, why should I do anything? You know, like, what's.\n78:26: Why am I solving problems? There's a million problems. How do I pick a\n78:30: problem to solve if. If it's just, you know, there's water, there's energy,\n78:34: there's clean air, there's all the SDGs. How can I actually\n78:39: know what the right thing to do is? And I was kind of questioning my\n78:42: intentions. In the Muslim tradition, it says everything you\n78:45: do is by their intentions and only by their intentions.\n78:49: So I wanted to make sure I had good intentions,\n78:52: but I didn't know how to do that. Father Greg Boyle, once upon\n78:56: a time, somebody asked him, yo, Yo, Greg. Yo, Mr.\n78:59: Boyle. What he does is he has something called Homeboy\n79:03: and Homegirl Industries, where he works with the,\n79:07: you know, recently incarcerated, they're now freed. They're not in prison anymore.\n79:11: But they might have a lot of tattoos. They might have a whole\n79:14: life history. They might have the gangs that they used to be a part of\n79:18: that, that they're still connected\n79:22: to. And actually, some of his. The people that he was\n79:25: working with were killed by\n79:28: the gangs that they had left. And he tried to find Job\n79:32: opportunities for them. He helped them with tattoo removals. He was just always there for\n79:35: them. And, you know, he's a white guy, and he didn't have\n79:38: to be in LA working with this population. He could have been anywhere else,\n79:43: much, you know, less challenged. He didn't have to go through the grief of\n79:47: the murders that some of the people that he was working with,\n79:51: you know, lived. And when they asked him why\n79:54: he did it, he didn't say, because it's\n79:58: the right thing. He's a Christian, he's a priest. It's the right thing to do.\n80:02: God told me to do this. He didn't say any of\n80:06: these things. He said something that changed my life. And what he\n80:10: said was, because they are my friends,\n80:13: he called them his homies. But he said, because they're my homies,\n80:17: they're my friends. I realized that when\n80:21: you are putting yourself into a relationship with\n80:24: people based on, like, friendship and love, good action happens.\n80:28: So Kalayan lives in this village. These are his people,\n80:32: These are his now family. It's his extended family.\n80:36: It's not that Kalyan is working for\n80:40: another, and he has to think about, like, what's a good intention or what's the\n80:43: right thing to do, or what would the UN fund\n80:47: in terms of a project. If it's related to, like, women and green and,\n80:51: you know, under the water, under the land or, you know, whatever. It's. It's not\n80:55: so rational, although it's good. It's beautiful to work on projects that support\n80:59: women and employment and all of these things. But if the.\n81:02: If it's more of the story, and now we're moving a little bit\n81:06: deeper, I'm trying to move away from just the narrative and, like, what's good to\n81:09: do to talk about this relationship building.\n81:13: And in the notes, you can see we talked about a\n81:16: couple of principles, right? Getting close, working with\n81:20: a problem that you faced. So. So I forget who I was talking to.\n81:24: Was it Hillary? I'm not sure about. About water.\n81:27: And initially we heard the story of,\n81:30: like, yeah, people in villages and rural, rural areas, they walk so far.\n81:34: It's really painful. It's really bad. And then I heard, like, oh, yeah, I got\n81:37: sick. And then I saw them and I realized that they were like me and\n81:40: we could solve the same problem. And then it became something that's way closer\n81:44: to home. And so I'm actually curious\n81:48: if we don't have to go through all the stories right now. But I just\n81:51: want. I believe that probably everyone\n81:55: here has somebody that has supported them,\n81:58: inspired them, encouraged them. And I'd love\n82:02: just to see that name and just for us to take a moment of,\n82:05: like, gratitude for the people that brought us\n82:09: this. This kind of inspiration or this showing\n82:13: us a different way of doing things that we're now trying to follow in\n82:18: their footsteps. So for me, it would be Father Greg Boyle.\n82:22: You can, you know, I want to see some names\n82:26: in the chat. And we have already moms,\n82:30: of course. It's beautiful. My mom as well. My mom is a\n82:34: very curious person, a lovely woman who loves to learn and\n82:39: yeah, thank you for reminding me of her. Francis,\n82:42: Cara, Emilio Clark, Any other goats,\n82:46: Greatest of all time. People that have inspired,\n82:50: especially around this, like, what you're doing. Right.\n82:54: Maybe somebody that even encouraged you. Or it could\n82:58: be the, you know, the people that you're building relationship with.\n83:01: You know, for me, Saleh is a big source of my inspiration.\n83:04: When I was living in Lebanon and we started this. This house together.\n83:08: Alana, Gerald. Thank you,\n83:12: Charlotte. Thank you, Tony Robbins. Absolutely.\n83:15: It could be people that you've read, people that you've seen online.\n83:18: I've never met Father Greg Boyle in person, but I heard a podcast\n83:22: by him, and literally after that podcast, I bought a plane ticket and moved to\n83:26: Lebanon because I realized that I couldn't do my work hypothetically\n83:29: anymore. I had to be grounded in person. And I was living in\n83:33: San Francisco and I was traveling a lot, and I really\n83:37: changed my life after this one podcast. Abaja Johnson\n83:41: Sisters. Okay, what I'm gonna do is if\n83:45: someone wants to gush and tell us\n83:49: why this person is such an important and transformative person in their life,\n83:53: I'd love to hear one story and then take a. Take a bathroom or tea\n83:57: break. So who here really just wants\n84:01: to show some gratitude and tell a story about how this person\n84:05: was kind of a transformative figure and changed\n84:09: their life or led them to doing what they're doing today.\n84:13: We heard a lot from Ricardo. We could hear from Ricardo.\n84:16: Not a problem to hear from Ricardo. But no, no, don't lower your hand.\n84:19: I just want to see if there's anybody else. Okay. I don't think we've heard\n84:21: from Priya yet. Okay, Priya. And we. We can do both. We could do\n84:25: Priya, Ricardo, and then coffee break.\n84:28: Let's follow Priya.\n84:34: Should I start? Yes, please.\n84:37: So I talk about a person.\n84:41: So basically I met him in the regional\n84:44: hub, and so it's related to this\n84:48: program. And I was working on completely different project which,\n84:53: like, in the end of the Day that project was not having\n84:57: that credibility because we were talking about, you know,\n85:01: tracking the sustainable carbon footprint related to food industry.\n85:04: And then after having long, long conversation with him\n85:08: after like for a week, almost like because\n85:12: we are there for three, four days. And then every day we used to sit\n85:15: with that person and he used to tell us about what going in the\n85:18: market, how basically market react, what is the steps\n85:22: or the right way to approach a problem. And after that I figured\n85:26: out two things that artificial intelligence and sustainable energy\n85:30: is going to be something which is going to be the future\n85:34: sooner or later. And the way he told us about, you know,\n85:38: what is the major issues in India related\n85:42: to skill development, why industries are not that successful,\n85:46: why we are not able to deliver quality product. And he\n85:50: talked about, you know, how people are losing\n85:54: interest while doing things and you know, it is more\n85:59: kind of stress them out. So you know,\n86:02: he talked about inner child of\n86:06: people, like how they should be focused.\n86:10: Like you know, when we are kids we enjoy doing things,\n86:14: we. And we do not think about the failures.\n86:17: So somehow we have lost that inner child. So he\n86:21: like stressed about that, that we should not lose our inner child.\n86:25: We should enjoy what we are doing and we should be grateful. And it\n86:29: whole journey is kind of a process which.\n86:32: Hang on. And that person name is Nihal.\n86:36: He's present.\n86:39: Excuse me, sorry. Nihal was one of mine too.\n86:43: So we had some. So yeah, that person\n86:46: name is Nihal and he used to sit with us and he used\n86:50: to educate us, guide us and talk about the projects\n86:53: which he have done and how what is the right way to approach the\n86:57: problem. So this was very inspiring. And because\n87:01: of that I was able to understand the core\n87:04: problem and structured my whole project into a very different way.\n87:08: Now I'm working in sustainable energy. Like basically I'm\n87:12: working on recycling lithium batteries and\n87:15: how we can extract the rare minerals and how we can remanufacture\n87:20: using those minerals,\n87:23: new batteries. And apart from that I'm working how we can use\n87:26: artificial intelligence,\n87:29: streamline our supply chain and the operations\n87:33: and how we can, with the help of virtual reality, how we\n87:37: can retrain workers through multiple hours\n87:41: and how we can provide them right and specialized training.\n87:45: So beautiful. And I really like this, you know,\n87:49: the way that you told the story and you buried the lead until the end.\n87:53: It's. These are, these are great things. I think, you know, one of\n87:56: the subtle elements where we're connecting here,\n88:01: you know, is authentic leadership. We're not, we didn't use that\n88:04: word at all. But this idea of being able to\n88:07: really understand your values, the stories\n88:11: that inform you, the people that inspire you, the reason\n88:15: why you're doing your work, this is going to be really important for you for\n88:19: all of your projects as you're looking for partners, funders,\n88:22: teammates, all of these things. So hopefully this\n88:26: has been valuable and interesting. I'd love to\n88:30: take a coffee break if people want to stay. I'm open\n88:34: to hearing some more stories of\n88:38: gratitude. Gratitude is\n88:42: one of the world's best vitamins, if you're interested.\n88:46: Vitamin D, vitamin G. You know, you gotta\n88:50: have some vitamin G in your life. So I'm willing to stick around,\n88:55: get some water. But let's take.\n88:58: How long do you guys want? Five, ten minutes.\n89:03: Let's take a. Let's take seven.\n89:06: Nice in the middle. It's a compromise. We'll take about seven\n89:10: to 10 minutes. Get some tea, get a break.\n89:14: And you know what? Maybe just, like, really reflect on\n89:18: what you've just heard. The stories, the inspiration.\n89:22: Think about the stories that you heard and, like, what parts resonated\n89:26: for you. This is. This is really important.\n89:30: I think, you know, touching this really deep element\n89:34: of authentic leadership and really\n89:37: understanding a problem by caring and connecting deeply to the\n89:41: people you're trying to solve a problem for is going to be foundational. I'm focusing\n89:45: on it so much in the design process. It's the whole first\n89:48: day. Because after that, that stuff is\n89:52: practical. It's easier. It's more step by step. So take\n89:56: some time, reflect on it. Feel free to do some journaling, and I'll see you\n89:59: guys here in 10 minutes. Insha'Allah.\n90:09: Let's pause the recording. Recording stopped.\n90:14: Yeah.\n90:55: Oh, yeah. Good idea.\n91:03: The heart that you can\n91:08: let the music take\n91:14: you home Just\n91:19: another love song\n91:28: Six minutes left to\n91:54: make it feel all right you\n92:45: can feel still\n93:37: love Just\n93:45: another love Nam\n94:53: in your heart Let the music take you home\n94:59: Just another love music\n95:44: take you home Just another\n96:35: Just another.\n97:03: How was the pee break?\n97:07: Welcome back. All right,\n97:23: people feeling hydrated?\n97:30: People feeling ready\n97:34: to continue? Need some stretching?\n97:38: Actually, you know what? Like, one thing that people don't do\n97:41: enough on zoom calls is stretch. Can we play a little bit of any other\n97:45: song and what\n97:49: you guys did for your break? But I just sat. I just\n97:53: sat the whole time. And I think it would be nice\n97:57: to move and actually to connect it\n98:00: a little bit with some of the ideas of the\n98:05: design principles is we're\n98:08: going to get to a point where we want to not use words to\n98:12: share our projects. We want to be able to point at something\n98:16: and have people understand it. So right now just feel how\n98:20: you feel and then move. So let's play some songs, let some\n98:24: people return and let's just get some emotional\n98:28: visualization.\n98:45: Zubi, Zoo,\n98:50: zoo.\n99:21: All right.\n99:25: I feel like only the facilitators are dancing. Hopefully other people have had\n99:29: their breaks. Okay, I want to see\n99:32: some. Ricardo pulled some great moves. Yeah,\n99:36: Ricardo, definitely. Who else was there? I saw a little bit of bopping with Lucy.\n99:39: There was a little bit of this. Like let's move the hat around. Yeah,\n99:43: this hat needs to move. I don't need to move, just the hat.\n99:47: Maureen, sweet,\n99:49: wonderful. We're getting some people still coming back.\n99:54: Okay. You know, before I move on, I just want to gut check people.\n99:58: Feelings, how are things going? Recording in progress. Yeah.\n100:02: So as we are back from our short break, hopefully.\n100:06: Yeah, I kind of want to get a gut check. How are people feeling?\n100:10: How are things going? Did anybody have any insights,\n100:14: lessons learned, questions?\n100:20: Yeah, so feelings, insights, questions.\n100:29: There's a big smile. Okay, go ahead Priya. And then Hillary.\n100:36: So I'm feeling that it is really important to\n100:40: connect your story with emotions when you tell them and\n100:44: with your past experience because like\n100:48: you know how it all started, where, where do you see\n100:52: yourself? Like basically what's working, what's not working and how we can do it\n100:55: better. Like simplifying and three words. So it\n100:59: is really important to make someone understand. It should be an investor\n101:03: and the language should be so simple that a\n101:07: person, like even a five year old person like child should\n101:11: understand your story. Like you know what exactly you want to do.\n101:15: So the language is very important the way you communicate and\n101:19: whenever you are telling your story, you should be passionate about it and you\n101:23: should exactly feel so you should. So in your\n101:26: head it's, it's not that like I don't\n101:30: know I want to do it or not, but I'm just doing it. So you\n101:34: should be passionate about whatever you're doing. You should be enjoying that thing apart\n101:38: you should not think about money or like any fame. Like you should\n101:42: be connected to you then only it's going to create a\n101:46: greater impact from a small or to a larger level\n101:50: as they said. Very good line.\n101:54: Local to vocal. Like you know, from getting local to\n101:59: getting on the global level. So that should be what\n102:03: a leader should be like, like you know, do working\n102:06: on a ground level, creating impact on the global level.\n102:10: So yeah, I feel like it sort of feel like\n102:14: your share kind of touched almost all of the lessons learned.\n102:18: It's like, okay, you got to stay connected. You got to be local. You got\n102:21: to connect your emotions. You got. Anyway, it's really wonderful.\n102:25: It's almost a great summary of a lot of the takeaways that. That I.\n102:28: I also saw. Anybody see anything else or.\n102:31: Or want to share something or have a question?\n102:37: Maureen? Yeah.\n102:43: I don't know how you noticed me. I was not raising my hand. I was\n102:45: about to raise my hand when you mentioned my name. Spider sense. Wait,\n102:48: who's the. Who's Parker?\n102:51: I'm the one with spider sense. Okay, go for it.\n102:55: So mine\n102:59: is a bit of a question. So the\n103:03: problem that I'm trying to solve is targeting the marginalized\n103:06: community, and it's primarily on addressing hunger and food security in the region.\n103:10: Right. So the idea is to work with women to do\n103:14: farming in this community, and then we do value addition to come up with\n103:18: a product that can be sold in markets and supermarkets.\n103:21: So my question, which is tying me down, is to understand what should be my\n103:25: primary focus. I'm having a very hard time there. Should my\n103:28: primary focus be on empowering these women to do the farming,\n103:32: or should it be the value added product that we are bringing to the\n103:35: market? And that is what I will probably\n103:38: need some help with because I'm having a hard time doing my prototype because I\n103:42: don't know how to answer that question. Yeah, but they're all connected,\n103:45: though. Yeah. So this is. This is an amazing question.\n103:49: Later, when I'm your mentor, I'd love to think and talk with you about this.\n103:54: Well, you know what? Actually, one of the things that I wanted to bring into\n103:57: this room today is one of my principles that.\n104:01: Okay, let's answer this question, and then I'll answer your question.\n104:04: Who do you think the smartest person in this room is?\n104:09: It's not me. Just. By the way,\n104:16: I was gonna say you. No, absolutely not.\n104:19: There's Nihal. Are you gonna say me? Come on. Okay. Who's the smartest\n104:23: person in the room? And Joyce, of course. I'm sorry. Who do you\n104:26: think is the smartest person in anybody?\n104:31: Like, except for Nilam, because she knows the answer.\n104:37: That could be. It could be, like, technically, but there's.\n104:40: There's. There's a. A creative answer.\n104:46: I mean, I could also sacrifice myself and\n104:50: say that I think I'm smart. That's beautiful. I think self\n104:54: confidence and agency. Absolutely. The people that think they're smart\n104:57: wind up having more ideas. They allow themselves to\n105:01: say things and have ideas because they think they're smart. So definitely,\n105:05: by all means, it's very likely you're the smartest\n105:08: individual in the room. But. Exactly.\n105:10: Ricardo. Yeah. Jessica.\n105:13: Yeah. Nyasha. Everyone got it? Okay. We. Yes.\n105:16: Georgina. Okay, cool. Okay, awesome. Thank you.\n105:20: Wow. You guys. Okay, so obviously we are in a room full the smart people\n105:23: who figured out the smart answer, which is Everybody.\n105:26: Okay. The smartest person in the room\n105:30: is. I'm going to write it.\n105:34: It's. It's capitalized because it's a proper noun. It's the\n105:37: room. Okay. So what I would like to do is take your question\n105:42: and although it's not exactly related to the design,\n105:45: like step that I wanted to take right now, but I think I\n105:49: was in your room and I know that you know your story, I know that\n105:52: you're really passionate about it. So we don't need to get to the authentic leadership\n105:55: part in the storytelling. You're good on that. We can work on this problem for\n105:58: you. So what I would like to do is ask the room.\n106:02: So I'm going to also showcase maybe my,\n106:05: like, listening skills or my lack of listening skills and trying to share\n106:10: the problem for the room. The problem, as I hear it,\n106:13: is that there are people\n106:18: that don't have a lot of food and that they're. There's hunger\n106:23: and there's poverty, so they're poor. And you can either create food\n106:27: or you can create money, which turns into food. And what\n106:31: you are wanting to do is. I.\n106:34: My understanding. Let me just. Could be wrong. This is. My understanding is you\n106:38: want to support them in creating value\n106:41: added products, which means, I think you're trying\n106:45: to create money for them so that they can get food,\n106:48: not necessarily produce food with farming. And so the challenge\n106:52: that you're having is should you support the educational\n106:56: component where the women will develop the\n107:00: skills to produce whatever the\n107:04: input material is through the farm, or should you\n107:07: work on developing the markets and the connections with the shops that\n107:11: are going to hold this value added product? And it's a chicken and egg problem.\n107:15: And now I'm going to not share my thoughts, but I would love\n107:19: to hear the room. Did you understand the problem? And does anybody\n107:23: have an idea about how to help Maureen with her challenge?\n107:26: First of all, did I get the problem right clearly enough so that. Okay,\n107:30: good. So that's the. That's the problem. So it's a chicken and egg problem.\n107:33: Focus on teaching the farming or focus on developing the marketplace\n107:36: where the value added products can be sold.\n107:42: How would somebody here address this? And if you don't\n107:45: answer. I'm just going to pick somebody. Anybody.\n107:53: Remember, you're the smartest person in the room. It's the room we want to\n107:57: hear. You know, you could have a horrible\n108:00: idea that inspires somebody else to have a good idea. So whatever your idea is,\n108:04: it's valuable because this is how collective intelligence works. So please,\n108:09: what are your first thoughts?\n108:14: I have a similar issue. I'm sorry, I didn't\n108:18: read my.\n108:22: Between creating like a market in my project\n108:27: there is no market really. So I'll be opening the market.\n108:32: But I think the first\n108:37: step is knowing if there is potential for\n108:40: that market for the idea you have and if there is\n108:43: no potential in that market, what do you have to change to\n108:47: open the market now? Because you might have a great\n108:51: idea, great project that will help the maybe the soil\n108:55: or the food producing in your area.\n108:58: But if there is no way you can\n109:03: expand the project, eventually it will just lag\n109:07: behind other ideas or maybe the detriment,\n109:11: the problem will overwhelm your project.\n109:14: So I would say there is a\n109:19: potential market even though there is no real market yet. So find\n109:23: it and then shape the project around that potential\n109:26: market to open it in the future.\n109:30: Interesting. And, and it's\n109:33: really nice to know that there are other people with a similar problem.\n109:37: So potentially you guys should just stay in touch and you\n109:40: can. You can hear more about what how Ricardo is.\n109:44: Has been exploring his problem and maybe he can also learn from you as you\n109:47: go. Priya.\n109:50: Priya. Run. John. Awesome.\n109:53: Go for it. So basically what\n109:57: I used to do. So whenever I come across problem I\n110:01: used to note down everything like all the ideas,\n110:04: what is going around my head that the problem and all.\n110:07: Then I used to analyze everything like what\n110:11: are the. Like you know what's going to work like strength weaknesses,\n110:14: what can be the opportunities and what can\n110:17: be the threats. Like what can be the problems like government and all.\n110:21: Then we did in our one of the workshop like\n110:25: before means one of our module\n110:29: that how to because market is based on multiple things\n110:33: like there are we. In short it's not Pascal analysis.\n110:37: You can say where you talk about the politics\n110:41: organization and what other factors are associated with the market.\n110:44: After analyze that you when you start understanding\n110:48: you will come up like similar problems. Like you will come to some\n110:52: of the conclusion that okay, this thing I can work on after\n110:56: understanding that you can go for the people who has been already working\n111:00: into similar industries and who has like come across\n111:04: the similar problems because I did the similar thing.\n111:08: So you know you can Read about the papers or the news articles\n111:12: as the organization shares a lot of articles. So you can\n111:15: go across that, that okay in this area because\n111:19: there when you talk about you don't have soil, you don't have structure.\n111:22: So many people are going for like hydro farming.\n111:26: Many people are going for different types of farming.\n111:29: So we can start analyzing that. And there\n111:32: are as organized, there are multiple grants or\n111:36: multiple organization which support these initiatives. So you\n111:40: can think about coming across them like how\n111:44: you can talk to them and maybe you can\n111:48: run a similar project which is already going on like one of\n111:52: b visionary fellow run plastic for food or\n111:56: plastic for waste in Mumbai. So basically that\n111:59: original company, it started in Germany and he is thinking\n112:03: very similar something. So if someone is already\n112:06: doing something, you can, you know, take help and you can work on a\n112:09: very similar way. And so that you the\n112:13: half of the things like you save time into\n112:17: the research into these things because when there are multiple\n112:21: heads, you get multiple ideas, multiple solutions and then you\n112:24: can narrow down according to your requirement and\n112:28: then you can pursue it. It's a like hypothetically,\n112:31: like I'm just telling what I felt. It's nothing to do, it's not\n112:35: very systematic. I can understand. Yeah, it's my opinion.\n112:39: I, I, I, I had a lot of ideas already just hearing the two.\n112:42: And so the next stage in the the room\n112:46: is we actually ask the other facilitators. So Joyce,\n112:50: Nihal, I don't know if there's anybody else from DO here. How would\n112:54: you respond to this question? It's like going up. Actually,\n112:57: I forgot the most important part which Maureen even mentioned. Sorry,\n113:01: Joyce and Nihal, keep, keep your, keep your thoughts with you.\n113:05: Maureen, the most important person\n113:08: to answer the question in this whole collective intelligence exercise\n113:12: starts with, with you, like you said.\n113:16: So what are your thoughts if you're gonna step away\n113:20: from Maureen? What was your nickname?\n113:26: Okay, so Maureen's is over here. Now here's Mo.\n113:29: What would Mo tell Maureen?\n113:33: How would you solve it? Yeah.\n113:37: So I feel like maybe\n113:41: what more will tell Maureen will probably be to incline 100%\n113:45: on what she's passionate about, because these are two separate\n113:50: aspects of her project. Aspect number one is\n113:53: if she decides to incline the humanitarian angle of it, which includes I'm\n113:57: empowering these women through farming, then I will tell her if\n114:01: she's passionate about that whole process of empowerment, then she'll stick to it.\n114:04: Or rather if she's passionate about bringing about a product\n114:08: in the industry, in the food industry that supports or supplements and makes\n114:13: Availability and accessibility of food to people more\n114:17: important to having. She should incline to eat more. So it's,\n114:20: it's. So I think I would advise her to try\n114:24: and pick a side that she's 100 passionate about.\n114:27: Either do business through the body added product or\n114:31: stick to the empowerment angle to it and empower the women.\n114:34: Yeah. Before we go to Joyce and Nihal, now you're Marine again,\n114:39: answer Mo's question. Which one are you more passionate about? Don't be 100.\n114:43: It's hard to be 100. But which one are you more passionate about?\n114:47: Well, I'm more passionate about the humanitarian angle. I've been through that\n114:51: space and mine is to mostly support.\n114:54: It's well, availing these products in the market will\n114:57: help the women through generating income for them.\n115:00: But what I would want more is to help them think\n115:04: beyond what they have been conformed into\n115:08: believing and see the possibilities of them doing\n115:12: better for themselves and using the resources that they have to help\n115:16: themselves. So I would normally incline to know\n115:19: the humanitarian angle of it through empowerment,\n115:22: but then I also understand that there\n115:27: is need to, to,\n115:30: to finance the project. There is need to find ways to support\n115:34: these women through this empowerment program. So having the product and selling the product to\n115:38: generate money and then convincing yourself,\n115:41: now it's okay. We just wanted to know which one you're more passionate about.\n115:44: We got it. And you can, you can go have\n115:48: a debate with Mo later. Joyce, Nial,\n115:55: quick feedback. I want to, I want to head back into the slide, so just\n115:58: feel free. Joyce, you can start.\n116:01: Well, the question is, what part of the solution directly impacts\n116:05: your beneficiary? What is your community? We are in\n116:09: a workshop about prototyping with an in marginal community.\n116:13: So what is this community? And your\n116:16: decision should center around that beautiful yell.\n116:21: Anyhow, exactly what Joyce\n116:25: is saying too.\n116:28: All that. You put them at the center,\n116:32: fall in love with the problem, keeping them as,\n116:36: as that core, and then everything will fall into\n116:40: place. Yeah. Yeah. That's beautiful. Okay, so now like\n116:44: this whole like pyramid thing we started with, we kind of put Maureen in the\n116:48: middle, but we're supposed to have started with Maureen. We asked your cohort,\n116:52: hopefully you feel that support, you feel that encouragement.\n116:55: And, and often like, like you mentioned the beginning,\n116:59: you kind of have that trust and like, wow, I can actually answer my own\n117:02: questions. Okay. I think that's a lesson for\n117:05: everybody here before you go off. I know that you guys have mentors,\n117:10: but really think about it. When you ask a question,\n117:14: answer it first and then go\n117:18: out and ask your cohort, ask Lucy,\n117:22: ask Zach, ask others, and then\n117:25: you'll start to see that the answers are out there.\n117:30: We just have to open the channels of this kind of collective. Collective creativity.\n117:35: Okay, anybody want to share something\n117:38: about this experience or would you like to move to the\n117:42: next phases?\n117:52: Hi, everyone. Hi.\n117:56: Well, as for me of Land site,\n117:59: our projects are interrelated.\n118:02: For example, Maureen is working with the marginalist communities.\n118:06: I'm also working with the marginalized communities, and I'm also\n118:09: from one of the marginalized communities back in Kenya.\n118:13: And so my project is about, like, period poverty,\n118:17: and Maureen's project is about, like, food insecurity\n118:20: and on. Honestly, I've witnessed that,\n118:24: for example, in my community, like, most of us, like, we tend\n118:27: to eat and drink just like, the milk and\n118:31: ugali, which is scarce. Like, we have to\n118:35: work, like, so many kilometers to have access to this\n118:39: food and all that, and it results to malnutrition and\n118:43: all those problems. So, like, I realized that if we\n118:46: share our projects with one another and get to,\n118:49: like, integrate our projects, for example,\n118:52: if Maureen is working with a modulus community back in\n118:56: Kenya on the issue of food security, and I'm also working on the issue of\n118:59: period poverty, like, we can always join hands and maybe\n119:03: help the community together. And instead of\n119:06: solving just one problem, we'll end up impacting so many people\n119:10: and solving a million problems. Yeah. And I just want to, like,\n119:13: tell you all you're doing amazing. Your projects are quite inspiring.\n119:17: And, yeah, I'm rooting for you all. Thank you.\n119:20: Beautiful. What a beautiful way of ending\n119:24: this collective intelligence practice.\n119:29: We. We start. We just before the break. We started with gratitude and,\n119:33: like, sharing the people that supported us from\n119:37: before. And now we're seeing the. The strength\n119:41: and the support and the willingness to collaborate and potentially,\n119:46: I heard, like, join forces or work together more closely somehow,\n119:49: especially for people with similar projects working on similar\n119:53: issues. Really beautiful. And I, from my side,\n119:57: I strongly encourage that we. What is it? You know,\n120:01: I can't use the word Ubuntu in a room full of Africans, so. But I\n120:05: guess I should. There's this idea of Ubuntu that\n120:09: we go far when we go together. And. And I'm,\n120:13: you know, in a small way, I'm a little part of it, and so is\n120:15: father Greg Boyle, and so is my mom. We're all going far together\n120:19: by sharing what we have with the people that we're\n120:22: connected to. So that's. That's really beautiful. Thank you so much. Lucy.\n120:26: That was, that was, that was really wonderful. What I want to do is actually\n120:31: go to what Lucy just shared\n120:35: and stop. Oh, sound share. Yes. I'm going to stop\n120:38: the sound share and I'm going to go over here. Are we,\n120:42: are we recording still or do we want to turn that on? Okay, great.\n120:46: So what exactly\n120:50: is marginalization and what are our resources?\n120:54: I want to just shift\n120:57: our mindsets a little bit. You know,\n121:00: when, when we go to school, we are so often\n121:04: told you are smart or you are dumb, and here is\n121:08: your, like, this is what you're worth.\n121:12: You got a B plus. Okay. It's not even showing anyway. Like, we're given grades\n121:16: and we're defined as individuals, but we're\n121:20: not actually individuals.\n121:23: We are fed through the\n121:26: hands of dozens and dozens and hundreds of people who\n121:29: work in places near and far.\n121:33: Like, our mothers cared for us so much when we\n121:36: were children to be able to bring us to this place. We have all likely\n121:40: a teacher or somebody that said just the right word at the right\n121:43: time. We're not exactly doing it on our own.\n121:46: Right. And the way that schools kind of make it out\n121:50: to be, if you're smart, you win and you should win at the\n121:54: expense of everyone else. This is traditional schools. You might have had better schools or\n121:57: better teachers. But I'm making a generalization for kind\n122:00: of traditional what one of\n122:04: Nihal and I's friends, Abhijit, calls colonial schools.\n122:09: And why do you think they give you grade letters? They give you a,\n122:12: B, C, D. Just like we have cuts of meat that are grade\n122:16: A, grade B, grade C, grade D. Or we have screws.\n122:20: You know, a grade A screw, screw means that it has no flaws.\n122:23: We're being graded because the idea is that we fit\n122:26: into a machine, but we are not.\n122:30: I really want to change this idea and I think we\n122:35: need to really rethink some of these ideas of not just intelligence and\n122:39: how the smartest person is the room and open our hearts to each other and\n122:42: support each other, but also like, what are our resources?\n122:45: And it's, it's really rethinking things rather than\n122:49: being like, okay, so maybe there are some funders out there\n122:53: that have resources or businesses or grant giving organizations or the\n122:56: UN and we must access that to be able to have this\n123:00: type of capital, to be able to start a business, to be able to solve\n123:03: a problem, to create more capital that will then return to the funders somehow\n123:07: they're investors or otherwise. But there are different things that we\n123:11: have access to. And so there's,\n123:15: this comes from my, my studies in permaculture,\n123:19: and this is from the Appleseed Collective's thinking.\n123:23: They have a whole article on the eight forms of currency. There may\n123:26: be more. They maybe you might debate some, you might think of them as less.\n123:30: But I want all of you with your challenges,\n123:34: with your problems, the things that you want to work on, think of the people,\n123:37: think of the community, think of you as well. This is one of the pieces\n123:41: of advice I would have given Maureen about her problem. Very similar to\n123:45: what she said is who are you really?\n123:48: Like, where, what, what are the things that\n123:52: are nearest to hand? Where are your strengths going to\n123:55: create that momentum so you can break that chicken and egg problem? You know,\n123:59: where's that most likely to happen first? And so maybe\n124:03: it's important to also think about these types\n124:06: of capital that you have when you bring them to bear on your projects.\n124:10: I'm curious, like, which one of these stands out to you?\n124:14: You know, think about your, your challenge area and then think\n124:17: about which of these types of capital you are the\n124:21: most rich in. How about we type it in? Like maybe\n124:25: pick, pick your top three most wealthy types of capital.\n124:29: So for instance, if you feel very, very well connected socially and you know so\n124:32: many people, many different places, you would put that as your first\n124:36: and then what is your second and what's your third? So let's take a moment,\n124:39: let's look at this and then. Hi, Rosemary, I'm glad you're here\n124:43: too. Thank you. And let's,\n124:46: let's think about like, breaking this idea of\n124:49: the dollar is king, the dollar is not king, nor is the lira or the\n124:53: euro or whatever. There's a lot of different kinds of capital that we overlook\n124:56: when we're trying to solve a problem. So write\n125:00: your top three. I'm going to do the same along with you and\n125:03: just put it in the chat. Let's see.\n125:13: Yeah, so it's not just with you and your life, it's in the context of\n125:16: your projects, what you have access to, to bear, to solving\n125:19: the problem. So if you have a farm,\n125:23: for instance, you would have living capital,\n125:26: intellectual capital.\n126:02: I'm also curious if Nihal would do it like what, what your\n126:06: top three are and then you as you as well. Joyce. I'm trying,\n126:09: I'm trying to think about it right now. It's, it's a little tough.\n126:14: So probably.\n126:27: Okay, this is probably my stuff for sure.\n126:34: Intellectual, cultural, very similar. I, I was debating between cultural\n126:38: and spiritual, actually. Social, experiential,\n126:41: cultural, this is kind of cool. You know, I was really thinking of taking\n126:46: the chat and you know, coming up with a Google Doc\n126:49: and gathering all the insights because we've put a lot of amazing\n126:53: stuff in here. We should not delete this. If anybody here is\n126:56: off camera and is not really, you know, able to participate with\n127:00: audio and wants to open a public Google Doc and start taking\n127:03: notes and like consolidate this stuff, I would really appreciate it. I hear\n127:06: that you guys have a forum. It would be really amazing at the end of\n127:09: this session for you to take your notes, your thoughts and just journal\n127:14: a little bit about what you learned, what you're taking away and what you're going\n127:16: to do about it and put it into the forum. I'll give that\n127:19: as an assignment at the end. So does\n127:23: anybody want to share their top three\n127:28: and then think out loud about how\n127:32: it touches their projects?\n127:36: There's a bit of live creative practice,\n127:43: so you can just start with telling the story of your top three.\n127:46: And I'd love to hear from somebody. Zach, I see that you got your camera\n127:49: on your Internet looks good. Would you be willing to share with us? I don't\n127:52: think we heard much from you today. Yeah, I'm happy\n127:56: to share that. Some of my largest capitals\n128:00: at this moment would be intellectual. I really know what I am\n128:04: doing. I have a background in what I'm doing. I have experienced it\n128:07: firsthand. So experiential capital comes in.\n128:10: Secondly, I have lived in context of my project,\n128:13: human world, conflict hotspots and worked in those for\n128:17: like four years now. And that one\n128:20: would be social capital. I have a bunch of social,\n128:24: a bunch of groups that I can reach out to bounce ideas,\n128:29: consult and also I would say that I have a community around me\n128:33: that's really supportive, listens, and the\n128:37: community that I'm working with is part of my social capital and they are\n128:40: the biggest asset to my project success. And I'm loving working\n128:44: with this current community. Wonderful. Looking at all of this,\n128:49: these ideas of capital, does it give you any ideas of how\n128:52: to bring any to bear in a new way\n128:56: or one that you didn't really think of as a type of value that might\n129:00: be supported, supportive for your project?\n129:04: Definitely, yeah. And this is the\n129:08: social element of it we've talked about. We've reflected back on\n129:12: some of the previous successful kind of projects\n129:16: or some of the things that inspire us and I feel like at this moment\n129:20: engaging with my current community, I feel like we could use\n129:25: a combined, I don't know how to put it, nexus of\n129:29: three of these or four of these. And that could bring us to\n129:33: a good starting point henceforth because\n129:38: this is real new content to me. This is not taught in\n129:41: school and you cannot pick this from any textbook that is outside there,\n129:45: wherever. And this is what we really need to push our ventures forward. And I\n129:48: feel like a combination of a couple of this would\n129:52: do magic for, for my venture and yeah,\n129:55: generally for. Very, very interesting.\n129:58: I think, I think it's so important to do this partially\n130:03: because of what we were hearing just earlier about\n130:07: how important it is to be be\n130:11: aware of your own intelligence. Because then,\n130:14: then you are more inspired to be intelligent. You are more inspired to actually\n130:18: use it. To actually think of yourself as a intelligent, this kind of positive feedback\n130:22: cycle. And when someone thinks of themselves as impoverished but\n130:27: is surrounded by love, right. But because they don't have like dollars\n130:30: in the bank, they feel poor. There's potentially a negative feedback\n130:34: cycle. And so I think that one of the things that this framework,\n130:38: this way of looking at our, our value\n130:42: is in realizing like wow, you know, I see some of\n130:46: the more rare ones are experiential. Actually, no, the last three are all\n130:49: have experiential, but there's just. We're rich,\n130:52: you know, we're wealthy beyond measure. Given all\n130:56: of the incredible experiences you were talking about working in conflict zones,\n131:00: I, I'd love to, to learn from you. I also, I have\n131:04: a recent experience in Muslim and Iraq post conflict\n131:08: reconstruction. And it's just we can learn\n131:11: and support each other so much. So when people were thanking\n131:16: each other for their mutual support with their ideas,\n131:20: we need to realize that that's just one of the kinds of capital that we\n131:23: have to be able to share with each other. Right. And we have so much\n131:26: more. And just opening up this framing\n131:30: I think can be really valuable. Does anybody else want to like,\n131:34: does anybody else have an aha moment that they want to share about\n131:38: how this might support their project? Yeah, I can share something actually.\n131:42: Yeah, sure. Mentioned idea as\n131:45: part of the, as part of the currency. And I just want and\n131:49: have a discussion about that. Because your idea is a seed.\n131:54: It's not a statue. Like it's not a\n131:57: form of fixed currency. Your greatest\n132:00: asset, maybe whoever typed idea. You simply mean your ability\n132:04: to come up with the idea. But I urge you to detach yourself from\n132:08: thinking of your greatest assets as your current idea.\n132:12: No, it's not. It's your insight into the problem and your commitment\n132:15: to solving it. Right. So I\n132:18: challenge you to consider your relationship with\n132:22: your idea as a flexible one that actually opens up\n132:25: better opportunities to other currencies. All right,\n132:29: beautiful. Yeah, I didn't, I didn't catch that.\n132:32: Yeah, maybe they were intending intellectual capital, but I think it's a very\n132:36: valid point. I think sometimes people can think of.\n132:39: There's actually a book called your ideas are your only currency,\n132:43: which I think you would really disagree with. But I\n132:48: think maybe the book's main point is your ability to\n132:51: generate ideas is your only currency, which is actually something that we can move to\n132:55: next. After this, I wanted to have some more like\n132:59: creative fun, fast paced ideation\n133:03: and creative problem solving stage. But I want to make\n133:06: sure that this really sinks in. And I'm curious if we\n133:10: have any other moments\n133:14: of inspiration or insight, like looking at your challenge and the problem that you\n133:17: want to solve and looking at your list of what\n133:20: you have to give it, what new ways\n133:24: potentially of solving it can you see?\n133:27: Yeah. Does that resonate with anybody or.\n133:39: It could be homework. Because I feel like this is actually a take\n133:43: 20 minutes to journal sort of question, but if anything pops up for people.\n134:10: All right, does anybody want me to pick\n134:14: somebody or anybody want to share or do you want. You guys want to move\n134:17: on? Actually, I'm curious. Don't even tell me an answer to\n134:20: that. To the question of like how to use these capitals for your projects.\n134:24: I just want to hear what you're thinking about. I'm seeing people looking at the\n134:28: screen. I have a feeling that you guys are like reflecting. Does anybody want\n134:31: to reflect out loud? Followed Ricardo.\n134:39: Well, I think this could be like,\n134:42: also interesting. Not necessarily,\n134:45: well, part of building your project, but as well,\n134:49: using it to the story building. Not directly,\n134:53: but also to take into account what resources we have.\n134:57: Maybe not said like, oh, my living capital is this,\n135:01: but know what your living capital is and integrate\n135:04: them to the storytelling as\n135:08: a valuable asset\n135:12: you have in your favor.\n135:15: Yeah, yeah, that's. That's a really important idea, the cultural capital.\n135:19: And I feel like this connects to some of this idea of like authentic leadership\n135:23: and being able to tell a story that moves people.\n135:27: Yeah, that's. That's a. I didn't actually see that connection between some of\n135:31: the stuff that we talked about earlier and that form of capital.\n135:35: Priya Ranjan.\n135:40: I think it can be used to structure\n135:45: your story in a better way. Like I\n135:48: can see how everything is important,\n135:52: like from, you know, your action idea,\n135:56: money, how you connect with connections. Then some\n136:00: people connected with a song like, you know, you, you say,\n136:04: I heard in like, in this song, there's a beautiful line. And then\n136:07: you connect your story up from that.\n136:10: So, like, what idea I'm getting out of it.\n136:13: So everything is, like, very interconnected and can be\n136:17: used in a structured way to tell your story passionately.\n136:21: And plus, you can mold your story\n136:25: according to the crowd. So which can\n136:29: I can. I can see and I can understand. Like, when you\n136:32: talk to spiritual leaders, you know, like,\n136:36: you can talk about karmas, like, if we are doing\n136:40: good for the world, then you connect with your environment, and then you\n136:43: connect with what exactly you are doing. So I feel like when you\n136:47: talk about a person who's a businessman, so you talk about money, so you\n136:50: talk about your problem statement, your knowledge. Why did you come up\n136:54: more in a systematic way? And then when you talk about\n136:57: kids, you talk more about, you know,\n137:00: impact, how this thing is going to change\n137:04: the world, how they will get a clean energy or,\n137:08: you know, fresh air, fresh water because\n137:12: of what we have done today. So,\n137:15: like, what. I got this point. It can be very systematically\n137:20: used and mold your story according to an individual\n137:24: person. That's. That's beautiful. That's. That's very interesting.\n137:27: As you're sharing, it kind of inspired\n137:31: me to think of this, you know, as you're talking about,\n137:34: like, the different stakeholders and the story that weaves the web.\n137:39: One of the things that made me think is, like, what if that new store.\n137:43: Let's talk about, like, business and investments. What if we came to the\n137:46: table and instead of saying, okay,\n137:50: the. The only investment in this business is going to be\n137:53: valued in the 1 out of 8 of\n137:58: the Capitals that we have, which is financial capital, and everything else is irrelevant.\n138:01: What if we had, you know, even shares allocated for people bringing\n138:05: different types of capital? And. And I think one of the interesting\n138:09: things that you. You said that kind of inspired\n138:13: me into thinking about this is making\n138:16: the. It's. I feel like maybe this framework\n138:22: really is important for.\n138:24: For everybody because. And especially people\n138:28: that fixate on one type of capital.\n138:32: And I. I always felt like when I\n138:36: was younger that if I just did the right thing\n138:39: and I did things that I thought were beautiful, that life would always work\n138:43: out and, you know, I would be rich at some\n138:47: point. You know, I just. I would be well off. I wouldn't have to worry\n138:50: about, like, money anymore. It turned out it was\n138:54: true, but not in the way that I thought. And for some time, I was\n138:57: kind of disappointed. I was like, I did everything, you know, like, I'm trying to\n139:01: be in service. I'm Solving real problems, like,\n139:04: where's the wealth? And then I, I realized, like, wow, I have Nihal and now\n139:08: Joyce and like all of you in this room. And I have all\n139:11: this experience that I can share from my life about like building robots\n139:15: and working in mus and architecture, and I can connect with\n139:18: Alexander about that. And like, I never really realized that I was rich\n139:22: until I started. I don't like using this word because of some\n139:26: reasons, but it's. It's sometimes the best word to use. But like,\n139:29: decolonizing this thing and like, what it thinks\n139:33: money and value is. Okay, I hope this was interesting. I hope it was helpful.\n139:37: And I want you to keep these in mind when we\n139:41: get into solving the problem. Just like, you know,\n139:45: if you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail, right?\n139:49: Once we get into the problem solving and the creative elements,\n139:53: this kind of opens up a whole different range\n139:56: of possibilities of, you know, instead of thinking of your.\n140:00: The people that you're supporting and solving problem for as impoverished.\n140:05: What. What do they have? Right? Which one of these\n140:08: eight different kinds of capital do they have? And how can they become\n140:13: seen as. As valuable contributors? And instead of, you know,\n140:17: solving a problem for them? I think that when you start thinking about all these\n140:20: forms of capital, it'll help you think about how to solve problems with them.\n140:24: What are they bringing to the table? And, you know, maybe you do need\n140:27: to make a map. Like, we heard about\n140:30: the SWOT analysis. You know, maybe we do need\n140:34: to make these maps, actually draw it out. Like, okay, so what do I have?\n140:37: Social capital, material capital, who else is in my community? What do they have?\n140:40: And then what are the problem we're trying to solve? How do they actually touch\n140:43: it? And then just, you know, think about it. I know,\n140:46: like, I asked the question, trying to do something that is actually pretty big,\n140:49: and I think it might require some contemplation and connection and\n140:53: time and all the other things and the principles that we had connection to\n140:56: community. But I really hope this framework is helpful for you.\n141:00: And we're going to work on an\n141:03: element right now in experiential and intellectual\n141:07: capital. Okay, how are we going to\n141:11: do this transition? I wanted initially to.\n141:16: Yeah, you know, let's just go straight into it. Where is that?\n141:21: Okay. Okay, does everyone have.\n141:25: Put your fingers on your keyboards. Get the chat thing open. You guys got your\n141:28: chat thing open. You got your keyboard open.\n141:32: Okay, so this is going to go from really\n141:39: thinking about your problem, feeling your problem,\n141:42: remembering the people getting into the story,\n141:45: feeling your value and your emotions. And now\n141:49: we're going to move from that and into. And then even understanding\n141:52: different kinds of capital, how we can think\n141:56: of the. Open up the problem space a little bit more even.\n141:59: Now we're going to get into some action. So I'm\n142:03: going to put one minute timer here and\n142:06: I want people to not press enter. You can just put commas.\n142:10: Okay. I want you to write as many uses for this thing\n142:14: as you can in one minute. You got\n142:17: it? Keyboard's open. Everyone ready? One minute.\n142:22: I'm not gonna join you. Don't be cheating. But I'm gonna do it on a\n142:26: paper. Okay. Three, two, one. You guys ready? Clear.\n142:29: You know what this is? It's a paperclip.\n142:33: As many uses as you can. The minute has started. Bismillah.\n142:36: Yallah.\n142:39: Joyce, you can. You can do the exercise. Can play some music.\n142:51: Okay.\n142:55: Yeah. Don't press enter until you're done. You can just put commas.\n142:59: Marine. Keep going. You have 30, 30 seconds left.\n143:06: It.\n143:41: Okay, Boom. Stop. Everyone stop. Okay,\n143:45: now you can press enter. Let's see what we got. Let's see your creativity.\n143:49: Look at this. Okay, so holding people together.\n143:53: Very good. Earrings. Wow.\n143:56: Hang objects. Hanging marker\n144:01: for book lovers. Awesome. We learned something about Deborah. Hi,\n144:04: Deborah. Haven't heard your voice, but it's lovely to hear you write or see\n144:08: you write hair\n144:11: clips. I feel like somebody has definitely used this as a hair clip.\n144:15: Is this like from personal experience? Is that experiential capital up in her?\n144:19: It sounds like it. Okay. Holding buttons for clothes.\n144:21: I love that one. Okay.\n144:25: We talked a little bit about education. Education is\n144:31: sometimes the enemy of creativity. So this exercise,\n144:35: when you give it to people that are six years old,\n144:39: they have tons of answers.\n144:42: They have many, many more. I forget the exact statistics, but they actually write a\n144:46: lot more. And once people get to fourth grade and fifth grade,\n144:50: maybe they're like 10, 11, 12, 13.\n144:53: The number of answers they get starts declining. Does anybody have\n144:57: a guess why that's the case?\n145:07: Listen, I don't like the sound of my voice, honestly. Like, I would love\n145:10: to hear some from some from some others. I know you\n145:14: guys are here, you guys are writing. Okay, you can write the answer. I don't\n145:17: mind. Why do you think? Okay, it's for that Bill.\n145:21: Why do you think that people reduce the number\n145:25: as they get older and they go through more schooling?\n145:28: I feel like people reduce as they get older because\n145:32: they become more self conscious. They are more\n145:36: aware of right and wrong, and they\n145:39: tend to think before the act. When you're very young, you're kind of sort\n145:43: of of more impulsive and out there.\n145:47: But as you get older, you get a bit more reserved and you\n145:51: wonder, like, what will people think if I say this and this?\n145:55: What will people assume? So,\n145:58: but as a kid, you just do. You just do it instantly.\n146:02: Like the moment you think about it, it's done. Yeah,\n146:06: just like that. Beautiful. I think you, you had a lot of\n146:10: the important elements. Zach,\n146:14: did you have anything in addition? Anybody else have anything in addition?\n146:22: Alexander, I think,\n146:26: I mean, the order you get and the more educated you get, you know\n146:30: more about the intended purpose of things.\n146:33: Which of course limits you in a way of seeing\n146:37: all the other possibilities this thing offers, which you\n146:41: originally still have, because you don't originally do know the\n146:45: intended purpose. So you just think, okay, what can I use it for?\n146:49: Yeah, we saw a lot of people, first thing they put was hold the paper\n146:52: together, which is great. I actually, I really like that. I like that. Because you\n146:56: didn't censor yourself. You're like, this is too obvious. But no, you just went\n146:59: for it. So you're actually on the right track here.\n147:02: Deborah says our creativity is eroded once we're exposed to structured information.\n147:06: Creative side works best when there's no limit to how much it can explore.\n147:10: Beautiful. Okay, there's another\n147:14: element that I remember, which is they\n147:18: don't limit the thing\n147:21: to the thing itself. They also imagine they have their creativity\n147:26: still alive. So they imagine, what if it was a hundred\n147:29: feet tall, Right. What if it was made out\n147:33: of chocolate? I could eat it, right? That's an answer.\n147:36: It's a paperclip made out of chocolate. You could eat it. Of course it's an\n147:39: answer. Okay, so with all of these things,\n147:43: we're going to try to bring about our\n147:46: six year old child self. Remember your nickname,\n147:49: Bulbul? I was called Bulbul back when I was six.\n147:52: Okay, we've got Parker over here. We got. I forget a\n147:55: lot of this. Other nicknames have. We got all that guy is still around,\n147:58: that girl is still around, the young person's still here.\n148:01: So remember, let's put on this attitude of like, no right,\n148:05: no wrong. What else did we hear from Bill? No right, no wrong.\n148:10: It could be made out of different materials. It could be really\n148:13: big, it could be really small, it could be scaled, it could be changed.\n148:17: There's no judgment. We all are here to support each other.\n148:20: Okay, so we do go until another half hour, right,\n148:23: Nihal? It's just some people have to go early.\n148:26: Yeah, we have Another half an hour. Okay. Okay. So put\n148:30: all that stuff aside. Let's make this an exercise\n148:34: in writing speed. Okay? Just. I'm going\n148:38: to get the timer. Don't think of ideas yet. Okay? This is not about\n148:41: thinking about ideas. It's about letting go of thinking and letting\n148:45: yourself write without holding yourself\n148:49: back. Okay, you guys ready to try it one more time? Remember,\n148:52: comma, comma, comma. So no, don't press enter. You're going to put a minute on\n148:56: the timer. Write as many uses for\n149:00: this thing as possible in the one minute that we have. Everyone,\n149:03: fingers on keyboard. Ready, steady,\n149:06: and go, you six year olds.\n149:10: All right, here we go. It.\n149:40: Sorry.\n150:21: Okay, that's it. That's our minute. So three,\n150:25: two, one.\n150:29: Okay. Some of these are pretty long. Seems like we got\n150:33: some longer time. We can also explore the quality of\n150:36: the creativity. Wow. Interesting.\n150:40: Yeah, definitely. I'm seeing a lot more creativity\n150:44: here. Does anybody want to share,\n150:47: like, what it was like between the first time and the second time? Did you\n150:50: guys have more fun? Was it. How was it any different?\n150:56: Ooh, weapon to prick friends with Zach. I don't\n150:59: know if I want to be friends with you.\n151:07: Yeah. How was it for you guys? Like, I'd love to hear somebody\n151:11: first to the second, and maybe I'll just pick someone who I know\n151:14: is here but hasn't spoken much like. Chetan. I think he's here.\n151:18: Chetan. What was it like between the first and the second time?\n151:23: He's here. Yeah, hi.\n151:28: Go ahead. Yeah,\n151:31: it's about, like, you. You think about\n151:35: things which are around you. Like, in my case,\n151:38: I thought about things around me. Say, one guitar.\n151:42: Then I thought about, why can't we, you know, place this there? It's about\n151:47: the things which are around me and taking this thing to fix that.\n151:51: That's it. Beautiful. So I\n151:55: actually kind of like that as a creativity enhancer.\n151:58: They say a lot of creative people have messy desks. And it's\n152:02: really interesting because it allows you to make connections with different stuff.\n152:05: Right. Like, you can see it and you're like, okay, paperclip and,\n152:08: you know, the, like locking the door or paperclip and\n152:12: xyz. So I like this idea of, like, looking around you and making\n152:16: those connections. Nyasha.\n152:22: I would say this time around, this was the real me typing.\n152:26: And it was a competition to get the smartest answers.\n152:30: So I really enjoyed the second time.\n152:34: I think that's. That's beautiful.\n152:39: Yeah. That you felt like more yourself. I feel\n152:43: like this. We heard about children twice today. Right.\n152:47: Once when we were talking about, you know,\n152:51: we were hearing from. Who are we hearing from? Was talking about children.\n152:58: Yeah. Sharing about Nihal's stories and, and how we\n153:03: can, we can learn from bringing a more childlike perspective.\n153:09: Yeah. Interesting. You're laughing while doing it.\n153:12: Okay, so what does the world need more of?\n153:19: Children. Children, people who've come alive.\n153:23: And I think that, you know, oftentimes,\n153:27: you know, when we are in,\n153:30: I don't know, I can just imagine myself really in\n153:34: a classroom, doodling, waiting to\n153:38: get out versus children, like exploring\n153:41: and playing and creating. And we can, we. We have those\n153:45: parts of us, they're still alive. And we can reconnect with\n153:48: those again. And we can reconnect with them again to\n153:52: do something that means something for us, that creativity\n153:56: can be put into service. So I'm really glad that you had\n154:00: a good time doing this. I'm going to share one.\n154:04: One more little bit of creativity\n154:08: inspiration. I'm going to just get this\n154:12: picture and I'm going to put it over here.\n154:16: One moment. Oh, no, I closed it.\n154:19: I just closed the dab. Okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to\n154:21: put it in the chat. So can\n154:25: everyone see the, the thing in the chat? Actually,\n154:29: it's. We're done here, right? It's. I can share my screen again.\n154:33: I'll just do this like this.\n154:38: Okay, so this\n154:43: is a.\n154:45: Another test. Let me share my screen. Where's the screen share?\n154:52: Okay,\n154:56: wait a second. I made a mistake. I forget now.\n155:00: I remember now how to do it. So I want people to\n155:04: do the comma test again, but this time I want\n155:08: you guys to actually.\n155:11: Don't do commas, just do enter. Just write white\n155:15: things. You know, get in the chat, open it up,\n155:18: start writing white objects.\n155:28: I don't see any rice. Good.\n155:34: Okay, good.\n155:37: Okay, we got a good clip here.\n155:41: Now start writing white objects\n155:44: that are inside of a refrigerator.\n155:53: Okay, so.\n155:56: Okay. Okay. Do you, do you.\n156:00: I don't know if you guys can see the difference, but the first time I\n156:03: asked for white objects, it started off in this slow trickle\n156:07: and then started going quickly. But once I said stuff\n156:10: that is white, that's in the fridge. Look at this. We, we keep getting stuff.\n156:15: It just started to flow. Okay, you. You guys can stop now.\n156:19: Does anybody want to kind of reflect on this\n156:23: element and what it might have to do with creativity?\n156:26: Like, why would we do something like this and, and think about what\n156:29: it felt like to write random white stuff versus white stuff in the fridge?\n156:33: What Was what\n156:42: was your mind doing when you're thinking of random white stuff?\n156:46: I'm glad you're liking it, Bill.\n156:49: 12.\n157:00: Very broad. And we've got many, many ideas\n157:04: and sometimes we just need to, to limit it to a certain thing for us\n157:07: to give the right answers. Like at first we're just giving random answers like\n157:11: rice. And you don't really find that in a fridge unless it's cooked.\n157:14: But then once you say what white stuff is in the fridge?\n157:18: Now the mind is not reorganized, but it's\n157:22: restructured to now answer things accordingly. That's beautiful.\n157:26: I'm so glad I didn't mess it up enough that the point didn't come across.\n157:31: You know, I. Yeah, the idea of sharing the\n157:35: fridge, I hope it didn't spoil the creative,\n157:38: like fun, spontaneous surprise, but absolutely right.\n157:41: Did anybody else notice that? That when you limited it,\n157:45: it was smoother somehow?\n157:49: Okay, we got some nods, we got some yeses. Joyce says yes.\n157:52: So how do, how do we think about these two things?\n157:56: Right? Like the first one was kind of like no limits,\n157:59: right? Would it be a child? Like, no, it could be a\n158:03: beta chocolate. And then the second one was some limits,\n158:08: right? What do you guys, how do you guys\n158:12: reconcile that and creativity?\n158:20: It was more difficult on the second task. That's interesting.\n158:26: Yeah. You know, we don't have a lot of time. You know, the experience\n158:30: is really important for you guys to feel that, okay.\n158:33: Because you need to think of you in\n158:37: service of your mission, right? You have a problem, you have people you care about,\n158:40: you want to solve something that makes a real difference.\n158:43: And you need to think of your creative\n158:46: capital, your. All the capital that you have, have your\n158:50: intellectual abilities, your ability to solve problems, to be creative\n158:54: as tools in service of something. Remember we talked like in the\n158:57: Muslim tradition that everything is by its intention. It's less\n159:01: important for your solution to be super creative than it is to solve\n159:05: the problem. So do you need to limit things\n159:09: and set boundaries or do you need to open it up\n159:13: and open new spaces and new opportunities? I think it's\n159:16: really important to think of your creativity not as like, oh,\n159:19: I'm a creative person or I'm not a creative person. You're a human being.\n159:21: You're creative. That's the point. That's. It's a given. You just got to go back\n159:25: to being 6 years old. But now as an adult, how do you take that\n159:28: amazing creativity, the six year old, and put it in service to something that inspires\n159:32: you, right. That lights you up, that brings you to life that supports the\n159:36: people you want to support, that touches the\n159:39: thing that moves you, that connects to your values. Right.\n159:42: So I do these two creative exercises to\n159:46: show you the way that you can actually set\n159:50: the stage in here to open\n159:53: up and to narrow.\n159:57: And these are two fundamental elements of design thinking.\n160:00: Has anybody ever done a design thinking course?\n160:04: Okay, we have some yeses. So what, what is one\n160:08: of like the thing, what do you think I'm talking about? Like, like the opening\n160:11: up, the narrowing. Do you remember the design thinking course?\n160:14: Like what are those principles?\n160:19: Go ahead.\n160:23: Sorry. I did the rare course\n160:28: that the evisioner shared with us and\n160:32: they talked about first looking at\n160:36: the actual context of the situation, of what you think\n160:39: about it. And that's how you narrow the problems, like how\n160:43: it is really affecting the community. You're reaching\n160:47: out. So that instead of thinking\n160:50: like, well, they might have water problems,\n160:54: soil problems or contamination of water problems or something like\n160:58: that, it all goes down to okay, they actually only have like no\n161:03: management of the land and that's why they have issues with their crops,\n161:07: to say an example. So that's a way you narrow down the,\n161:11: the situation and what you need to really focus\n161:14: on. Yeah,\n161:18: yeah. So let me share this slide\n161:21: over here. And this\n161:24: is the design thinking sort of process.\n161:28: It starts with a challenge and\n161:32: then it goes to understanding, defining, ideating, prototyping,\n161:36: testing. And there's a loop that goes all the way to the start. Again,\n161:40: what I am wanting to point out\n161:44: is this diverge and converge. You basically have these two\n161:48: loops of going broad and trying to\n161:51: feedback and ideas and thoughts as possible and then another moment of\n161:56: converging. We're going to go through this process tomorrow with your,\n162:00: with your problems. I just wanted to give this\n162:04: here right after the creativity exercise because\n162:08: of the diverge and the converge and the idea of the\n162:12: different spaces that we're going to be working in and to have\n162:16: that be kind of in your mind, like how do we move from\n162:20: the story, the carrying the problem, understanding it,\n162:23: to moving into a design thinking or, or co design process.\n162:28: And this is, this is that transition here.\n162:32: I need a\n162:36: two minute break. So what I'm going to do is\n162:40: I'm going to put it onto the counterintuitive\n162:45: principles. And I want you guys to\n162:48: like, I won't be gone long but please look\n162:52: through these four principles and see\n162:56: if you can identify what\n163:00: I'm getting at. Like what is. So these are, these are creativity\n163:04: principles.\n163:08: How do these creativity principles emerge?\n163:12: What are they? And if you can come up with an example, that would be\n163:15: great. I'm going to just. And if you can play just a little bit of\n163:18: music. I just have to step out for one second and I'll be right back.\n163:21: Just hold one moment.\n163:25: How do I pause? Can we pause the recording as\n163:28: well? Recording stopped.\n163:32: All right. Just one second.\n163:42: All right. I will also share the screenshot to\n163:46: the chat and\n164:24: let me know if you need any clarity on any\n164:27: of these three. I mean, these four,\n164:30: for example, because you\n164:35: might even recognize some. Because I think, like, the Omid Macrine\n164:39: was mentioned in one of the ESL models.\n164:48: I was just wondering about what does Sikh beauty means?\n164:53: Yes. So there's this beautiful quote\n164:58: by this. This architect and.\n165:02: Sorry. By Buckminster Fuller, who's this amazing innovator.\n165:06: He says that when you seek beauty, you will automatically\n165:11: make design for design\n165:15: that lasts or designed for the people.\n165:18: Because when you inherently go after beauty, you also\n165:22: understand how it's. So there's this thing\n165:26: called fl. Form follows function. So if you\n165:29: can. If you just seek beauty, if you wanted to create\n165:33: anything out in the world. And Bilal will explain this beautifully from his\n165:36: personal examples, too. But if you go after\n165:41: building something, building something beautiful,\n165:45: it'll automatically add a lot of invisible elements to\n165:49: making the design or to making the environment\n165:53: a lot more hospitable. For instance,\n165:56: when we look at. All right, guys,\n166:00: I was fasting today, and I just had\n166:04: to break my fast. It became night,\n166:08: and we. We fast from dawn to\n166:11: dusk sometimes. And so I just had to get some. Some dates. Thank you for.\n166:14: For understanding. And, yeah, if you want, we can\n166:18: get a record. Oh, yeah, recording. Recording in progress.\n166:22: And we can continue Bismillah. Okay,\n166:26: so while Bilal, while you also do that,\n166:29: maybe talk a little bit about beauty and your role in beauty. I. I really\n166:32: love your perspective in.\n166:35: Especially on that part. Oh, goodness. Okay.\n166:39: I wonder how we can connect this. I mean, beauty is\n166:42: here, and you can see that beauty. Beauty is a part of\n166:47: the creativity principles.\n166:50: And, you know, I kind of think that there's a relationship here between\n166:54: beauty. If people know what biomimicry means,\n166:57: it means taking inspiration from nature and learning from how nature\n167:01: does things. And for me, I've always really\n167:06: had beauty to be a guide, especially when\n167:09: I'm having a really difficult, difficult time.\n167:12: And just over my life, I've found\n167:15: that when there are multiple options,\n167:18: choosing the one that makes my heart sing and the one that I think is\n167:22: beautiful, both aesthetically beautiful in\n167:25: its ethics, beautiful in its Perfection or\n167:29: good qualities. I've never been misled,\n167:32: right? And it's, it's helped\n167:35: me find my wife, it's helped me find my work, it's helped me have\n167:39: alhamdulillah, like a beautiful little baby boy. And even in\n167:46: physics, like very rational,\n167:49: technical fields, there are many\n167:52: examples of people who, when they're trying\n167:56: to come up with an answer to an equation or the structure of\n168:00: an equation, they choose before they know,\n168:04: they choose the one that looks the most beautiful or seems\n168:08: the most beautiful to them. And it also happens to\n168:11: be the elegant and true and beautiful\n168:15: solution. And so bringing beauty\n168:19: into our, our thought\n168:22: process around, like solving problems around this\n168:27: is like, I don't think about helping people as much as\n168:31: creating situations of beauty because it\n168:35: changes things from helper and helpy to\n168:40: a shared experience. A place where,\n168:43: you know, for sure there's hunger and people are working on\n168:46: really, really important issues. And you know, what's beautiful,\n168:50: sharing a meal with people, you know,\n168:54: and I kind of think will change some of\n168:57: the way that we see our work from. Maybe more. We talked\n169:01: about this word decolon, decolonize, do,\n169:03: decolonization from like, you know, market forces and\n169:07: solving problems and people with needs and all of this to thinking like,\n169:10: why am I doing this? You know, why do we talk about values? Why do\n169:13: we talk. Why did I try to get you guys to talk so much that\n169:16: you had an emotion and feeling? Because this is, this is\n169:19: for me, what I find to be the most inspirational. Inspirational is\n169:24: to have people say like, what is the most beautiful world?\n169:27: And to be working towards that out\n169:31: of longing and love rather than, oh my God,\n169:34: like climate collapse and I don't know what. And you never know,\n169:37: like there's people, you know, going to,\n169:41: you know, how does it go? Sometimes I think how\n169:46: we do anything is how we do everything\n169:50: right. And if we are running around in fear\n169:53: and putting out fires and hustle culture and solving the\n169:57: world's problems, but, but creating a horrible life\n170:00: for us, I don't think it's not going to rub off\n170:04: on the good that we're trying to do. Right? Elon Musk,\n170:08: God bless him, he says, like,\n170:12: you don't want to be me, but I'm gonna save humanity by taking us\n170:16: to Mars. You don't want to be me. My life is\n170:19: painful and difficult and hard. I don't want to be me, but I'm going\n170:23: to save everyone by making sure that consciousness survives on Mars. And I don't\n170:27: think that personally, like, like, I Like some of what he\n170:30: does, and it's great. But I do think that,\n170:34: you know, let's get even just practical for one second.\n170:38: If you are following this sense of beauty, you will never\n170:42: forget yourself in the cause of the cause you're working on.\n170:45: Right. You. Insha'Allah. I hope that as you guys are solving these\n170:49: problems and doing this great work, you are putting yourself\n170:53: into that relationship rather than this kind of outside observer\n170:56: being like, okay, here's a system that's broken, and here's how\n171:00: I can intervene and play with it to, as an outside observer,\n171:03: figure out how to make something better in an abstract sense\n171:07: rather than an experience that you, you know, like,\n171:10: let's say Father Greg Boyle is in the cafe and he's seeing\n171:14: some of the prisoners that are his homies, his friends, and they just\n171:17: got their first job and they bring in a cake and they're\n171:21: celebrating, and you're a part of it and you're seeing that and you just love\n171:23: it. And you're like, this is good work. This is my life, you know,\n171:27: and, yeah, I don't know. This is.\n171:30: I don't know if what Nihal expected me to share or why\n171:34: he wanted me to point out this beauty stuff, but I do think it's actually\n171:38: really important for change makers. I'm a part of this thing. Oh, it's f.\n171:42: No, no, absolutely. It's. Even with Noor.\n171:45: Right. And with. There. There is a little bit of\n171:49: intentional beauty in everything that you do, and I think\n171:52: that's important because sometimes we just focus on the function\n171:56: and getting something done. Yeah. But when you add beauty,\n172:00: there's so much invisible values that you add\n172:03: people who've created beauty 200, 300 years ago just with\n172:08: homes, and we're still cherishing it,\n172:11: we're still savoring it. Whereas now,\n172:14: when many of the homes are designed for functionality,\n172:18: it's not something that we remember. It's not.\n172:21: It doesn't bring us solace. So that invisible element is\n172:26: critical as we start to build up projects. It also\n172:29: makes us fall in love with what we're doing a little bit more.\n172:34: Yeah, absolutely. I think you. You brought\n172:38: in the word love, and I'm going to bring in a third word.\n172:41: Can wait. Before I do that, can anyone guess what the third word is going\n172:44: to be? We talked about it a couple times in this talk so far in\n172:47: this session.\n172:51: Beauty. Love. What would a third word that would kind of be friends with\n172:54: all those other words? You can put it in the chat if you're shy.\n172:59: What do we got here? Beauty, contemplation, observation,\n173:03: creativity. Beautiful. Very nice choice.\n173:06: Community. I like that one, too. Anybody else? So we got.\n173:10: We got beauty here, we got love and then something.\n173:15: How would you. How would you add to this trifecta? What would be creativity?\n173:19: I like it.\n173:26: One of my teachers says beauty is\n173:29: this. Oh, okay. Joy. Anybody else\n173:33: I'm liking? We're getting some momentum over here. We got creativity, we got joy,\n173:37: we got beauty, we got love. This sounds like something good.\n173:42: Oh, joy.\n173:46: Boom. That's it. Boom. Double boom.\n173:49: Yes. Close. Boom. Faith is similar. I. I think faith need\n173:53: is connected to truth for me. Awesome. Okay. Lucy and\n173:56: Charity. Absolutely. We talked about truth.\n173:59: We talked about truth here. And we talked about, like, listening to people\n174:03: and hearing their truth. You know, when you say, like, share your truth,\n174:07: right? And you hear someone's truth, you. And this is when they're opening their hearts\n174:11: to you. There's love, there's beauty, there's truth, and they're all\n174:14: connected. One of my teachers says that\n174:18: beauty is the splendor of truth. That kind\n174:21: of. When there is truth and you can see it as truth and accept\n174:25: it as truth, there's beauty there. And so when\n174:29: we are listening to hear people's stories, what else do we say about truth and\n174:32: stories? Where is that quote? We have a nice quote over here.\n174:36: Yeah. The shortest distance between\n174:40: truth and a human being is a story. And shortening\n174:44: a distance is what beauty does because beauty is like a flower. It draws\n174:48: people to it. Right. And that drawing, you can call that love.\n174:51: Right. So there are these relationships between these\n174:55: three things. And I think, however you\n174:59: like, what does it go? It's like there's a. In the\n175:02: Muslim tradition, it's says there's nothing.\n175:06: That gentleness doesn't beautify it.\n175:09: Right. And so how can this\n175:13: be connected to solving this problem, you know,\n175:17: that you want to work on, as we talked about, like, authentic leadership\n175:21: and caring and connecting to the emotion and the feeling and the care that\n175:25: brings people together through love, that helps people see each\n175:29: other through truth. Right. That then when you create\n175:32: the problem, the baby of it has to be beauty.\n175:35: Right? How can it be a beautiful thing?\n175:38: And I think this is a great question. I don't\n175:42: think I have time to go through these alternative,\n175:46: like creativity, like these counterintuitive creativity\n175:49: things. And maybe I don't need to, because sometimes\n175:53: I think it's better to focus on principles and then let people figure\n175:57: out the rest. And I think these three,\n176:01: you know, truth, beauty, and Love as\n176:04: a, you know, I think this\n176:08: is very beautiful. Like, I don't know about you guys, where did I put it?\n176:13: We talked about the eight forms of capital, right? Suddenly one\n176:17: of the things that I think is beautiful is all of these marginalized people are\n176:21: suddenly richer than I am. Right? In experience,\n176:25: like in, in spiritual capital. Of course. Like there's\n176:29: people out there that are probably very impoverished, maybe chosen a life\n176:32: of poverty, but their spiritual capital is vast.\n176:36: And to me, looking at other people through this\n176:40: lens of like, what wealth do I have to benefit\n176:45: from their company? That's a beautiful thing. Thing,\n176:47: right? And maybe hidden\n176:51: underneath a lot of our talk today about care\n176:55: and trying to connect to a true story and love,\n176:59: like the principles have always been there. I could have started my talk\n177:02: and been like, okay, love, beauty and truth, go for it.\n177:06: And it would have taken you maybe a lifetime to,\n177:09: to figure out how these all connect to social enterprises and\n177:13: solving problems and creating solutions for people. But hopefully\n177:17: going through it in these both directions, kind of like going through it\n177:20: through the personal experience of your story,\n177:23: learning about the people's truths, sharing your stories,\n177:27: connecting to the emotions, connecting to the values, and then\n177:31: looking through a different lens at what people have to offer.\n177:35: I hope this like really has shifted some thoughts\n177:39: about. Rather than seeing a problem as some\n177:43: practical like systems think where, I don't\n177:46: know, we're going to create a decentralized autonomous organization and an artificially\n177:50: intelligent, hyper efficient machine that will find the needs\n177:54: and the resources internationally and make sure that\n177:58: the food waste and Europe is, you know,\n178:01: on an underground maglev train\n178:05: to the places that need it so that there's no energy wasted and everyone is\n178:09: fed and everyone is satisfied versus\n178:12: realizing that we have an opportunity to create\n178:18: work of art with our lives connecting with people and creating\n178:21: moments of beauty where you don't want to rush it.\n178:25: If you see a problem and you think of it as a system, you want\n178:28: to go as quickly as possible to the solution. And there's a different way\n178:32: of doing things where you actually want to stay with it your whole life.\n178:35: And I really hope this is the beginning of a lifelong adventure of.\n178:39: We call it social entrepreneurship, call it like a work\n178:43: of art, of a piece of life as a work of art.\n178:47: But I think one of them is\n178:51: a, is a, is a, I don't know, is a label that I'm willing\n178:55: to put on me. And the other one, one is a label that,\n178:58: I don't know, it's just a label. You don't really\n179:01: Understand like what's behind it. It might have the beauty, might have the stories,\n179:05: might have all these other things like social enterprise or you know, impact business\n179:09: or something. But I really encourage you guys to do that because it'll\n179:14: light a fire within you for a life of. Of beauty.\n179:18: And I don't even want to say giving or contribution or solving problems or any\n179:20: of these things because that stuff happens, happens to be beautiful to do.\n179:24: Inshaallah. Okay. And with\n179:28: that, I think I'll leave a couple of moments for,\n179:31: I don't know, maybe just some. Some feedback, some reflection.\n179:35: And tomorrow we're gonna get back\n179:38: into like, let's say we got into this perspective now. We have a different mindset\n179:42: about how we want to move through solving this problem that we're\n179:46: carrying about so deeply. And we're going to go through some\n179:50: design processes and hopefully you'll think of yourselves\n179:54: as creative, as able to come up with a hundred ideas or not or\n179:58: set some limits and bounds and to. To do that in service\n180:01: of something that is worth being in service to truth,\n180:05: beauty and love. Inshaallah. So yeah,\n180:08: with that my. My main session is over. We're going to shift into\n180:12: the designy part tomorrow really\n180:15: hopefully staying true to our principles today.\n180:18: And I'm open for last few questions\n180:23: or comments or I want to hear other people talk instead of me.\n180:34: Thank you Bulbul. And I really appreciate the session\n180:37: today. It was very important, informative. I'm very\n180:41: happy to. To learn the last bit of it which is beauty,\n180:45: truth and what was the\n180:48: other one? I think I'm forgetting it, but I have it. The thing that draws\n180:51: you to beauty is love. Yes, love.\n180:55: Truth is when working on my project, I've always wanted to design\n180:59: it so beautiful that it draws people to it. The people may\n181:02: be using it in future. I did not know that it a component that's important\n181:06: in. In building a venture. And I really appreciate\n181:10: this last bit and also I'm happy to say that the session\n181:13: was really engaging, very informative and really fun. Thank you\n181:17: so much. See you tomorrow. Inshah. Y. Thanks Zach.\n181:27: Yo. Let's follow Ricardo. You can go by your nickname too.\n181:32: I'm sorry? You can go by your nickname too. I don't remember your nickname.\n181:35: Oh no, my. My father used to call me Changoleon, but I've\n181:39: had no nickname since I was six, so. Exactly.\n181:42: So Changa. Changoleon. Yeah,\n181:45: let me write it down.\n181:52: Like monkey lion in Spanish.\n181:55: I used to play trees and climb everywhere\n182:00: while I was younger. Just wanted to\n182:03: thank you. I think I got a lot of useful tools that\n182:07: I actually right now I'm building my business plan to go ask\n182:11: for a credit for my project. So I think I can get a\n182:15: lot of insight, a lot of useful insights\n182:20: from what I've got here and I'm really excited to see what\n182:24: I'll get tomorrow. Thank you very much.\n182:33: Glad it felt like a holiday, little mini\n182:36: holiday. Tell people it was fun. For the people that didn't show\n182:40: up and they were like, who is this guy? What is this?\n182:48: Okay, great. If you have the forum or a\n182:52: place to share some of these things really we learn through each other's eyes\n182:56: and I will learn from you. So tomorrow, you know, maybe I'll\n183:00: open up. Feel free actually. Yeah.\n183:03: What did you learn? What like what was an\n183:06: aha moment or a surprise or something insightful and\n183:10: what are you going to do about it? You know that\n183:13: could be your assignment. You can reflect\n183:18: and I will ask you tomorrow. Like I did a lot\n183:22: today. So for those who were in places with poor\n183:25: wi fi or on your phones, please be on your laptops. I'll try to make\n183:29: it as fun as possible for you and be prepared to participate. And I'm\n183:33: going to ask you for your reflections because that's how I learn. Otherwise,\n183:36: what did I get out of it? I just heard myself talk for three hours.\n183:41: So yeah, please.\n183:52: You could also offer constructive criticism. You can be like beauty,\n183:55: love and truth. I thought we were going to make stuff.\n184:06: Okay, any last words? Any less\n184:09: typing?\n184:13: Go ahead, Alexander. No, just in the\n184:16: last thing you said about like the criticism you\n184:20: say ah, I thought we're gonna make stuff. I mean of course it's\n184:23: like super important and sometimes I'm also thinking I would like to hear more practical\n184:27: things. But at the end all of these lessons also\n184:31: what you speak about, beauty, love and truth or\n184:35: like this feeling LED approach. I think it's\n184:40: so much so important especially at the beginning because this creates like\n184:43: the real base from which you will take\n184:48: all the energy and all the guidance. So sometimes\n184:52: we want to jump directly into like ah, this product. I want to do\n184:56: this, this and this. But as we often say it's\n184:59: more the problem and not a solution. And that's why I\n185:02: really enjoy these sessions as well. And I think they're,\n185:05: they're so important and for me just to say it already taking\n185:09: bit of headphones. Like my aha moment was just again the focus on the\n185:13: feelings. I also wrote myself down. Focus on the\n185:17: feelings. Yeah,\n185:20: that's my final point.\n185:24: Beautiful. Yeah. Your feelings are\n185:28: deeply connected to your values. It's the, it's the door to\n185:31: knowing yourself. So I think it's really, really wonderful that you\n185:34: wrote that down.\n185:41: You know, Listen, can't wait as well. Lucy. Tomorrow.\n185:44: See you. All right, one, two, team. Let Bilal go eat. I haven't\n185:48: eaten all day.\n185:53: I like this idea of the nicknames. I don't know how it came up,\n185:55: but. But it's pretty cute. And maybe,\n185:59: I don't know if we have like a forum or something like that. We just\n186:02: share the little story like the monkey lion about and\n186:06: we get to like learn a little bit about each other. Bulbul also\n186:09: means bird. My dad used to call me that when I was a kid.\n186:13: You know, in Arab families at least like parents always have pet\n186:17: names for their kids. So yeah,\n186:20: let's learn about each other because when we do that, then we see each other,\n186:24: we see each other's truths, we can love each other and then this is where,\n186:28: insha'allah, the community of support comes in.\n186:31: And we can really benefit from all of the different kinds of capital,\n186:35: wealth, knowledge, support.\n186:38: So yeah, let's come\n186:42: back tomorrow and move from these\n186:46: feelings and think about how to. To stay true to these\n186:49: principles and to this way of doing things, but move into a\n186:53: more action oriented process that lets\n186:57: you, I guess the word is operationalize what\n187:00: we started with today. Inshaallah. And to turn it into\n187:04: a thing to be able to share then with others if\n187:08: you feel. But you never speak, you never output. No one can\n187:12: know. So you can care about a problem, but there\n187:15: needs to be an output to too. Inshallah. Yallah guys,\n187:19: big hugs. I know for some people. Super late. Nihal. You're like,\n187:22: you've missed dinner and Isha and who knows what else. So thank you\n187:26: everybody and I'll see you tomorrow. Inshallah.\n187:32: Tomorrow. Thank you so much for participating with all your heart. And thank\n187:36: you so much, Bilal, for all your energy and love. I can't wait\n187:40: for tomorrow. Bye. Goodbye.\n187:45: Recording stopped. What's your nickname?\n187:48: Nihal Nahul. What do you call yourself?\n187:54: What? Sunny. Sunny?\n187:57: Really? And Joyce.\n188:02: Well, between Nihal and I am J. Lo and\n188:07: JLo and Lilo ni Hao. If we ever have a rap band, this is\n188:11: it. But my family calls me Nyung Nyong.\n188:14: Nyongyung.
