This research is in line with the National Strategy for Sustainable\nConstruction (NSSC) from the Chilean Government. One of the NSSC challenges is the training of\nengineers capable of adapting to the SC requirements. Although the competences in sustainability\nfor the training of engineers has been discussed in other researchs, it has not been specifically in\nsustainable construction and it have not been grouped in a model that considers their degree of\nimportance. The purpose of this article is to present a conceptual model can be used to design\nand evaluate engineering training programs in SC. The methodology to establish the skills and\nthe proposed training model consists of three stages: Theoretical Phase, Methodological Phase and\nValidation Phase (surveys and interviews). 113 professionals who performed activities related to SC\nanswered the survey. Interviews were conducted with five experts in training in different SC aspects.\nThree global skills are identified as: Sustainable Evaluation, Sustainable Construction Certification,\nand Sustainable Facility Management. In addition, the degree of importance of skills associated\nwith these global skills was identified and assessed. There are five skills necessary for the future\nengineer, among them, two stand out: teamwork (collaborative) and ethics. Finally, the order of\nimportance of the topics in SC is: energy, environment comfort, water, waste, and construction\nmaterials. A future investigation is recommended to apply the proposed conceptual model to current\nengineering training programs, both national and international.\nKeywords: sustainable construction; conceptual model; competences and skills; engineering education;\nmodel of sustainable education\n1. Introduction\nThe growing complexity of the construction industry forces professional engineers to evolve\nand adapt [ 1]. Currently, civil engineers must devise viable solutions that are affordable and in\nline with society’s aspirations, contributing to: economic growth, environment protection and a\nbetter quality of life. To achieve these objectives, the solutions must reach a balance in terms\nof: costs, benefits, quality and acceptability within the legislative framework, and involve the\nconcepts of life cycle costs that represent both the economic viability of the engineering project\nand its long duration in terms of tangible and intangible environmental impacts [2]. Therefore,\nthere is an urgent need to incorporate sustainability and social commitment into the engineering\ncurriculum [3]. For this reason, many authors [ 4– 10 ] have researched pedagogical strategies to\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3093; doi:10.3390/su10093093 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3093 2 of 19\ndevelop the competences and skills related to sustainability in engineering students. For example,\nde la Riva et al. [11] implemented a sustainability course for engineering students. They designed\nan innovative course combining lectures, workshops, and academic curricula with a character\ncurriculum education, outdoor activities, and community works in a creative and stimulating academic\nlearning. Helen Brain and Thomas [12] implemented Communicating Sustainability course explored\nthe deeper meanings of sustainability, and students learned about their own beliefs and behaviors,\ntheir community, and how to act as professional change agents. The course was structured around\nexploring the theoretical foundations of sustainability, communication and conservation theories,\nand communication techniques. Forment et al. [13] created a knowledge base that brings together\nscientific articles, books, videos, compilations of data, experiences, etc., related to sustainability and\nknowledge areas associated with computer science engineering. This is a tool that should provide to\nthe teacher accurate and useful information in the research task of finding links between her course\nand the “Sustainability and Social Commitment” skill. This article explores sustainability, specifically\nthe sustainable construction area.\nThe new paradigm of sustainable construction (SC), the globalizing tendencies that are taking\nplace in current societies and the need to face the increasing complexity and uncertainty present\nnew challenges that require the acquisition of new skills in engineers of the building sector. SC is\nabout creating and operating a healthy built environment based on resource efficiency and ecological\ndesign [14]. Its objective is to achieve a balance between the economic, social, and environmental\ndimensions (triple bottom line) [15]. The solutions that emphasize SC are: (a) the ecological materials\nused to reduce the material and energy demand in the building construction and operation [16– 22 ],\n(b) to achieve the thermal comfort of the inhabited place [ 23 –28 ] and (c) to achieve energy efficiency in\nbuildings [29–34].\nToday, the SC takes importance due to its contribution to tackle with climate change and its\npositive link with the efficient use of energy [ 16, 35 –38 ]. Governments have proposed various measures\nto support sustainability issues, energy efficiency and everything related to the environment [39 –41 ].\nSpecifically, in Chile, in August 2012 a collaboration was established between four Ministries (Public\nWorks Ministry, Housing and Urbanism Ministry, Energy Ministry and Environment Ministry) to\ncoordinate promote, and publicize the SC in the country. This agreement establishes the guidelines to\nintegrate the concept of sustainable development in construction and will serve to position the country\nat the regional level in 2025. The NSSC coordinates and links current energy and environmental plans\nthat have been developed in parallel in different government agencies. In this sense, the strategy is\nestablished as a tool to coordinate the different actions, goals and objectives in the short, medium and\nlong term. This strategy is composed of four areas that develop the priority issues for the SC\nadvancement in the country: (a) Buildings and infrastructure with sustainability considerations to 2020,\n(b) Commitment by the Commercial, Public and Residential sector to reduce energy consumption by\n12% (projected to 2020), (c) Reduction of 20% of greenhouse gases by the construction industry, based on\nprojected emissions to 2020, (d) 10% of the energy generated by unconventional renewable sources\nby 2024 will be contributed by the construction sector [42 ]. In this sense, the authors contribution\ntowards the NSSC is through the project called “Professional formation strengthening of engineers in\nsustainable construction and energy efficiency in the Maule región” This project allowed the execution\nof this rearch.\nThe inclusion of the concepts, criteria, and tools of the SC in the construction sector requires\nits dissemination and application by all the agents of the project-construction process. In this sense,\nthe training of professionals and technicians in SC is fundamental. Although the sustainability issues\nare widespread, there is a lack of information on the role of engineers in sustainability [43]. Researchers\nhave begun to develop, identify, and delineate key sustainability competencies [44–48].\nAccording to Aznar and Ull [ 49], the term competence generates a change in the way of\nunderstanding the human learning. The definition of skills is a complex and diffuse concept with\npsychological roots [50 ] and linguistics [51 ]; Bunk [ 52], notes that being competent is the one who has\n\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3093 3 of 19\nknowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to practice a profession, can solve professional problems in\nan autonomous and flexible way and is qualified to collaborate in their professional environment and\nwork organization. Several authors classify the skills [53 –55 ]. The basic division of the skill types are:\n“knowledge”, “knowing how to do” and “knowing how to be” [53].\nThe competences and skills developed in the sustainability field in engineering students have been\nassessed by different authors [56 –60 ]. Chandu and Kancharla [61] highlight the process of identifying\nthe skills required for sustainability, problems in curriculum design, implementation and impediments\nfor sustainability in engineering education. Thus, it is important to specify the study in the sustainable\nconstruction competences and skills.\nFinally, based on the context of Chile, the aim of this article is to determine the engineer’s\ncompetences and to present a conceptual model to design engineering studies programs in SC.\nThis model allows the formation of the new generations which is not a random process, but it will\nbe based on a planning design and continuous improvement of the study programs. This work is\ndivided into the sections: methods, results and conclusions. The methods explain the methodology for\nidentifying competencies and skills in sustainable construction. The results analyse the sustainable\nconstruction area and a conceptual model involving competencies, skills and issues is proposed.\nThe conclusions establish the conceptual model application and its projection for future research.\n2. Methods\nThe proposed methodology (see Figure 1) to establish the skills and the SC formation model\nconsists of three stages: Theoretical Phase, Methodology Phase and Validation Phase. The methodology\nis for SC training in higher education.\nStage 1 is based on a systematic literature review [62 – 64] to establish the SC concept and the\npreliminary skills. This search was made in Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science for the\n2012–2017 period. The search strings used were “sustainable construction” or “green construction”\nused simultaneously with “competence” or “skill”. The search was filtered at the intersection of\n“sustainable construction” and “skill”. These words were searched in the title, keyword and abstract of\narticles published in peer-reviewed journals. A total of 52 articles were found. The 52 articles were read\nby two of the authors and categorized as relevant or irrelevant. A total of 32 articles were classified as\nirrelevant by the authors and were eliminated. From literature review, it was decided to use the SC\nconcept by Kibert [14] to preliminarily guide the work with the experts in Stage 2.\nIn Stage 2, the SC model was constructed based on the execution of the method Developing a\nCurriculum (DACUM), since it aims to analyse the job position and the task to define the training\ncurriculum [55, 65 ]. The application of this method involved a facilitator and a committee of 15 expert\nworkers from the construction area. These experts are a part of the academic, companies, and\ngovernment. The matrix of the resulting profile is a detailed and graphic description of functions\nand tasks, performed by the involved experts [ 66 ]. The functions and works of the study were\nperformed following the procedure (Figure 2) based on the steps established by the Center of Education\nand Training for Employment College of Education from Ohio State University, United States [ 66].\nThe DACUM method has been applied in engineering education in different countries, which is\ndemonstrated by a search of the topics “DACUM” + “engineering” in Science Direct and scopus,\nresulting in at least 23 articles. Once the DACUM is done, the skills are determined with the\nmethodology described by Tobón [ 67 ,68], where the skills are identified based on functional analysis.\nThe criteria defined by Tobón [ 67 , 68] for the skills units description were followed. Then, a Conceptual\nSustainable Construction skills model of professionals in the construction area is elaborated.\n\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3093 4 of 19\nSustainability 2018, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 19\nFigure 1.

The\nHousing and Urban Planning Service of the Chilean Government validate these certifiers in the SC\narea. The survey was sent to 449 certifiers. The number of surveys answered randomly was 113; of\nthese, 65% corresponds to professionals who work in a company, 23% in government and 12% in\nuniversities. Self-employed certifiers were not considered since 45% of them have ceased to perform\nhousing certifications and 55% are not permanently engaged in housing certification activity.\nTherefore, the certifiers surveyed population is 138.

The degree of importance is based on a scale from 1 to the largest number\nof items, 1 being the least important and was not allowed to repeat the same value in another item.\nThe stratified sampling study and the survey exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with the internal\nconsistency evaluation (Cronbach’s alpha) was carried out by using the SPSS v22 software. This process\nwas performed first, to show that the sample of respondents is representative and second, to show the\nsurvey reliability. The population segment in the stratified sample is determined by the location the\nsurveyed professionals perform their sustainable construction tasks. The EFA analysis considered the\ngraphical criteria in the orthogonal rotation (Varimax) and the Kaiser criteria (eigenvalue > 1).\nTable 1.

Many of these sub-skills are at the intermediate and higher levels of knowledge, e.g., analyse,\nevaluate, explain, apply, optimize and management. This is the level of knowledge in sustainable\nconstruction that higher education trained engineers are expected to achieve. Then, five interviews to\nexperts in the area are performed (Table 1) to correct the details of the proposed conceptual model.\nThe interviews were semi-structured, as defined by Hernández et al. [ 69], since it is better to collect\ninformation that largely facilitates feedback. These interviews lasted at least 30 min. The willingness\nof the experts to share their knowledge to establish the skills and competences is appreciated.\nTable 2. List of subskills needed for training in SC.\nFeasibility Assessment\n1.

Interdisciplinary\nintegration that must be addressed with greater emphasis in the program is observed. This is because\nthe professionals mainly involved in SC are architects, engineers, and technicians of different\nspecialties: electricity, hydraulic, construction, chemical, mechanical and industrial. On the other\nhand, ethics become important because a professional with values and awareness of his/her\ncontribution to SC in current environmental context is expected. For example in the area of\nsustainability, Seager and Selinger [85] described the challenge of sustainability ethics education and\ndiscusses a new initiative in the Rochester Institute of Technology regarding ethics education.

Discussions\nThe methodology followed in this work responds to what was reported by Vásquez [91]:\nthe construction skills cannot be performed in isolation, but it must be done from a flexible and permanent\n\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3093 14 of 19\neducation, from an explicit theory of cognition, within the conceptual institution framework, in a cultural,\nsocial, political and economic environment.\nThe Sustainable Project Design global competence is the most important. Continuing in the order\nof importance is construction and operations management. Training engineers in SC must cover the\nentire life cycle, corroborating what has been described by other authors [2 ,41 ,43 ,92 ]. In addition,\ntraining in SC must be based on the incorporation of economic, social and environmental dimensions\n(triple bottom line) in projects. This is achieved with the early, articulated and integrated inclusion,\naimed at stimulating critical thinking in systemic interaction of environmental, social, and economic\nfactors; and the need to commit to sustainable development [43 ,92 – 96 ]. The latter being articulated\nwith advanced skills.\nAccording to advanced skills in this research, it is expected that the professionals trained in SC\nmust be able to Work in a Team in a collaborative way, since SC projects consider the contribution\nof different specialties, such as, for example: civil, electrical, mechanical, chemical, hydraulic,\nand economical works. The intervals of the results of the degree of importance of: teamwork in\na collaborative and ethical way, cross paths. This is consistent with what was answered in the personal\ninterviews with the experts, since they emphasized that both advanced skills must be synergistic.\nFive relevant issues that should be treated according to the level of skill required, within the\nimportance detected in this research are declared. All of these issues are in accordance with the\ndifferent sustainable building certification methodologies (BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE, Green Globes,\namong others). The Energy topic is considered of greater importance because the main purpose of SC\nis to optimize the energy use without compromising quality of life, which is why Thermal Comfort\nwas the second relevant issue.\nIt is proposed that the training of engineers in SC should be based on the courses: Design,\nFeasibility Assessment, Technical Inspection, Execution Construction Process, Planning Construction,\nReuse and Renovation and Demolition. Each of these courses should address issues of: Energy,\nenvironmental comfort, water, wastes and construction materials. In addition, consider transversal\ntraining in: Interdisciplinary integration, ethics, creativity and innovation, communication and\nnegotiation and empathy with stakeholders. The contents and activities of the courses must be\nbased on the sub competences set out in Table 2. All the above according to the degree of importance\ndetected in this research.\nFinally, technology innovation and transfer must be present in all SC training, because during\nthe course of all the research stages, the need to train engineering capable of adapting to current\nengineering challenges appeared. This study reaffirms what Yepes [1 ] described: the growing\ncomplexity of the construction industry forces professional engineers to evolve and adapt.\n5. Conclusions\nThe role of the engineer in SC goes beyond the realization of construction projects. The engineer\nmust be involved from the feasibility study of an idea to the work’s deconstruction, planning the reuse\nof resources. Therefore, the training of engineers is of vital importance. This article provides guidelines\nto be followed by any higher education institution that trains engineers in sustainable construction.\nThe degrees of importance of: the themes, advanced skills and global competences for the training of\nengineers in sustainable construction are presented.\nThe skills obtained with the methodology followed in this investigation, represent the construction\nareas in which engineers can evolve as professionals. The most important global competence for an\nengineer is Sustainable Project Design. Then, as part of this global competition, the Sustainable\nFeasibility Assessment becomes important. A project that has a high quality design will avoid serious\nerrors in later stages. All this considering the seven principles and the balance between social, economic\nand environmental aspects.\nAdvanced skills should developed by the engineering study programs for SC according to the\norder of least importance are: teamwork in a collaborative way, ethics, creativity and innovation,\n\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3093 15 of 19\ncommunication and negotiation skills and empathy with stakeholders. Note that the results validate\nthat collaborative teamwork must be performed synergistically with ethics.\nThe training of the engineer in SC should consider the five major issues. The results allowed\nordering them from greatest to least importance: energy thermal comfort, water, waste and construction\nmaterials. Emphasize that energy and comfort issues should be addressed in a synergistic manner for\nbuilding studies.\nFinally, in terms of future research, the evaluation with the proposed model of the study programs\nof the universities with the best Qs ranking is considered. The breadth and depth to address global\ncompetencies, skills and relevant issues will be measured. In addition, it is expected to determine the\ndetailed contents of a program study for engineer training in SC.\nSC should be considered of utmost importance in the current training of Chilean engineers. In the\nimmediate future, it must be fully included in the curriculum. A future investigation is recommended\nto apply the proposed conceptual model to current engineering training programs, both national\nand international.\nAuthor Contributions: Investigation, H.V. and C.C.; Writing-Review, F.M.\nFunding: This research was funded by Agencia chilena de Eficiencia Energetica (AChEE) with project\n“Fortalecimiento de la formación en Construcción sustentable y Eficiencia Energetica”and the APC was funded by\nUniversidad Catolica del Maule.\nAcknowledgments: Thanks to Agencia chilena de Eficiencia Energetica for the funded delivered in project:\n“Fortalecimiento de la formación en Construcción sustentable y Eficiencia Energetica”.
