Mosul Iraq has experienced major destruction in the last years due to the conflict with ISIS and now UNESCO, the UN and other organizations are collaborating on a sustainable reconstruction effort which I’m supporting. I’d love to connect with people who have worked on green housing, sustainability pedagogies and curriculum development, especially people who worked in post conflict areas although not necessarily. I am working on designing a sustainable reconstruction curriculum to support the local efforts to bring best practices as they work on rebuilding and I’m confident the collective intelligence in this group can help. Please reach out if you or someone you know can help. Many hugs from here in Lille France, I’ll be in Iraq in late August :)",
