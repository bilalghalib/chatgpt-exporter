      "content": "In Maliki Fiqh, which is one of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence, purity is a key requirement for prayer. However, the Maliki school is known for its flexibility and consideration of context in its rulings. If the blood on your shirt is very small in quantity, like a few drops, and especially if it's difficult to avoid due to your profession, like being a surgeon, it's generally considered excusable. This is in line with the principle in Islamic jurisprudence of hardship bringing ease in certain rulings. But it's always best to consult with a knowledgeable person or an imam familiar with the Maliki school for specific situations. Would you like more information on this topic?",

      "content": "In Islamic jurisprudence, including the Maliki school, cleanliness is crucial for prayers. When it comes to impurities like blood or fecal matter, the rulings can vary based on the amount and situation.\n\n1. Blood: A small amount of blood, especially if it's difficult to avoid due to your profession or circumstances, is usually excused. This applies to professions like surgery or if you get a minor cut. The key is that the amount is small and not easily avoidable.\n\n2. Fecal matter: When it comes to impurities like fecal matter, even a small amount is generally not excused. The rationale is that fecal matter is usually more avoidable and controllable than blood. So, if you get some on your clothing while changing a diaper, it's recommended to clean it before praying.\n\nThese rulings are based on the principles of ease and necessity in Islamic law. The idea is to balance the importance of cleanliness with practicality in daily life. But remember, these are general guidelines and interpretations can vary. It's always best to consult a local imam or scholar for specific cases. Do you have any other questions about Islamic practices or jurisprudence?",
