  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nBilal Ghalib, an educational research consultant and co-founder of Bloom, worked with Claude to develop a comprehensive proposal for Five One Labs' food waste and food security curriculum adaptation project. Bilal has a Master's in Education Sciences from Université de Paris and specializes in curriculum adaptation, entrepreneurship training, and training-of-trainers programs. He previously delivered a successful climate curriculum for Five One Labs and has experience adapting curricula for topics outside his initial expertise through work with organizations like ITC on solar energy, architecture, and insulation training.\n\nThe conversation focused on creating a 6-week proposal (late October through early December 2025) to integrate food waste and food security content into Five One Labs' 4-day entrepreneurial bootcamp in Erbil, Kurdistan Region. Bilal requested help finding relevant research reports and developing a strategic approach that would combine research synthesis with traditional Iraqi food preservation knowledge. He emphasized wanting to work collaboratively with regional practitioners like Shariha Khalid from World Food Hub and Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur, and Saad Chinoy, rather than positioning himself as a standalone expert.\n\nClaude initially created proposal materials that contained AI-typical language patterns, which Bilal identified and requested be revised. He specifically noted issues with promotional language, false ranges, overly formal tone, and phrases like \"stands as/serves as\" that sounded artificial. Bilal provided detailed feedback on his communication preferences, emphasizing he prefers direct, concrete language over flowery descriptions and wants constructive criticism rather than flattery. The final proposal incorporated Bilal's personal connection to Iraqi food preservation techniques learned from his grandmother in Baghdad, including basturma, dried meats, and date vinegar, framing these as practical business opportunities rather than cultural decoration. The proposal was structured around a 5,500,000 IQD budget for remote delivery with optional in-person training-of-trainers sessions in Erbil, and included clear deliverables for research synthesis, curriculum adaptation, materials development, and impact framework creation.\n\n**Tool Knowledge**\n\nClaude used web search functionality to identify six relevant research reports for Bilal's food waste curriculum project. The search strategy involved multiple targeted queries combining regional context with topic specificity. Searches for \"food waste reduction Iraq Middle East research report 2024\" yielded current regional data including Iraqi restaurant food waste studies showing 38g per capita waste and cultural factors affecting food consumption patterns. Combining \"food redistribution models social enterprise Middle East report\" found practical implementation frameworks and case studies relevant to the entrepreneurship training context. The search \"food waste circular economy entrepreneurship bootcamp curriculum\" identified business model frameworks and training approaches that could be adapted for the bootcamp format. Finally, \"traditional food preservation Middle East indigenous knowledge Iraq\" uncovered academic sources documenting Iraq's 7,500-year food preservation tradition, which became central to Bilal's differentiation strategy. The most valuable sources included the UNEP Food Waste Index Report 2024 for official methodology and metrics, Filimonau et al.'s 2023 study on Iraqi restaurant food waste for local context, and Journal of Ethnic Foods research on traditional Iraqi fermented foods for connecting indigenous knowledge to modern business opportunities.",

A new Terms of Reference (TOR) for a curriculum adaptation consultant role focused on food waste and food security\n\nThey want me to:\n1. First analyze their position based on our conversation history\n2. Ask 5 questions to help gather context for the new proposal\n\nLet me check if we have conversation history about this person. I should use the conversation_search tool to find relevant information about them.\n\nThe user's preferences indicate:\n- They like metaphors when figuring things out\n- They prefer Python for coding\n- They like constructive criticism and pushback\n- They don't like being flattered\n- Only say something is unique/groundbreaking if it's true\n\nSo I should be honest and direct, provide constructive feedback, and avoid unnecessary praise.\n\nLet me search for previous conversations with this user.I'll search our conversation history to understand your background and experience better before analyzing your position.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood! Now I have a much better picture of Bilal. Let me synthesize what I know:\n\n**Background:**\n- Master's in Education Sciences (Interdisciplinary Approaches to Research and Education) from Université de Paris\n- Bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics from University of Michigan-Dearborn (2009)\n- Co-founder and Head of Research at Bloom\n- 15+ years of experience in social enterprises\n- Expertise in pedagogical design, applied positive psychology, curriculum development\n- Strong background in entrepreneurship training and community-oriented learning environments\n- Experience with:\n  - UN International Trade Centre (ITC) in Iraq - curriculum development\n  - Five One Labs (current - just won climate consultant contract)\n  - Lebanese Innovation Support Organizations (Training of Trainers)\n  - Post-traumatic growth research\n  - Refugee/crisis contexts\n- Recognition: Compassionate Leaders Fellowship with Dalai Lama (2019-2022), INK Fellow (2012), BMW Responsible Leader Fellow (2017)\n- Fluent in Arabic and English\n- Lives in Lille, France, works between Europe and SWANA region\n- Iraqi-American background\n\n**Strengths for this proposal:**\n1. Previous successful work with Five One Labs (just won climate integration contract)\n2. Proven curriculum design expertise\n3. Experience adapting Western frameworks for local contexts\n4. Strong track record in entrepreneurship training\n5. Experience with research integration into practice\n6. Cultural and linguistic competence (Arabic/English)\n7. Track record with international organizations (UN ITC)\n\n**Gaps/Challenges:**\n1. May not have direct food systems/food waste expertise (need to check this)\n2. This TOR requires a Training-of-Trainers component - he has done this before\n3. Impact measurement framework - need to clarify experience with this\n4. The 4-day bootcamp format vs his 32-session experience\n\nNow let me provide analysis and then ask targeted questions to help craft the proposal.Based on our conversation history and your documents, here's my honest assessment of your position:\n\n## Your Strategic Position\n\n**Strong Hand:**\n- You literally just won a contract with Five One Labs for climate curriculum integration - you have fresh credibility and a working relationship\n- Your winning proposal demonstrated you understand their context (KRI/Erbil), their format (bootcamp structure), and can deliver in tight timeframes\n- Your pedagogical design expertise and Masters in Education Sciences from Université de Paris gives you theoretical grounding\n- Your Bloom work (933+ ventures across 16 countries) shows you understand entrepreneurship training at scale\n- Your Arabic fluency and SWANA experience means you can genuinely localize content, not just translate it\n\n**Honest Gaps:**\n- Unless I'm missing something, you don't have deep food systems expertise. This isn't fatal - they're asking for curriculum adaptation, not food science - but it's a vulnerability\n- The impact measurement framework requirement is specific. Your previous proposal didn't emphasize M&E expertise heavily\n- This is a 4-day bootcamp vs your 32-session experience. That's actually harder - compression requires different skills\n\n**The Real Pitch:**\nThink of it like jazz versus classical music. You've proven you can write a full symphony (32 sessions). Now they're asking if you can improvise a tight 4-day set that hits all the emotional notes. Your advantage is that you understand Five One Labs' audience deeply from your climate work - you know what resonates with KRI entrepreneurs.\n\n## 5 Questions for Context:\n\n1. **Food systems experience**: Have you done ANY work touching food systems, agriculture, supply chains, or food security - even tangentially? (I need to know how to frame any connection, or whether we lean into \"fresh eyes + research synthesis\" as a strength)\n\n2. **Impact measurement**: What's your actual experience designing impact frameworks and metrics? Can you point to specific examples where you created measurement systems that tracked outcomes beyond participation numbers?\n\n3. **Research synthesis**: The TOR emphasizes extracting insights from three research reports. Do you have access to those reports yet? If not, when do you expect them?\n\n4. **Training-of-Trainers**: Your climate proposal didn't include ToT. What's your actual experience facilitating ToT sessions? (I found EON ToT work in our history, but need specifics)\n\n5. **Budget reality check**: Your climate contract was 4M IQD for 5 weeks. This is 6 weeks but seems more complex (research synthesis + bootcamp redesign + materials + impact framework + ToT). What are you thinking price-wise, and what's your read on their budget range?",

Outside of your professional life, what personal passion or interest would you like to highlight?\n3.

Will this work directly help people who need it?\n2. Can I do it without lying about my values?\n3. Is the harm of taking their money less than the good I can do with it?\n4. Do I have an exit strategy when it gets too compromising?\n\n## The Alternative\n\nGiven your scattered focus and ethical concerns, maybe your path is:\n\n**Build First, Fund Later**\n- Create a small prototype with European funding\n- Show results with refugee communities\n- THEN approach Gulf funds with proven model\n- You'll have more leverage to set terms\n\nThis way you're not starting from a position of desperation where you might compromise too much.\n\n## Real Talk\n\nThe Gulf states want to buy legitimacy through funding \"innovation\" and \"education.\" You'd be taking blood money. The question is whether you can transform it into something life-giving for the communities they're harming.\n\nSome people can hold that contradiction. Some can't. Which are you?\n\nHuman: can you give me more information on this, how do i do that? is it a good idea for someone like me?: Academic Backdoors Your Master's from Université de Paris means you could: Apply for \"Chercheur Associé\" positions (part-time, paid research) Access PhD funding while working (in France, PhDs are paid €1800-2400/month) Get EU Marie Curie grants for \"practicioner-researchers\"\n\nAssistant:  ## Academic Backdoors in France - The Reality\n\nThe academic path could work but has major catches for someone with ADD who gets bored and likes to build things quickly.\n\n### Chercheur Associé (Associate Researcher)\n\n**What it actually is:**\n- Unpaid or barely paid position in most cases (€0-500/month)\n- Gives you academic affiliation and library access\n- You need a professor to sponsor you\n- Requires regular presence at seminars/meetings\n\n**How to get it:**\nEmail professors at Paris 8, Paris Nanterre, or EHESS who work on:\n- Digital humanities\n- Critical pedagogy  \n- Post-colonial tech studies\n\nSend them your PTG research + AI concerns work.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/cee2d98e-efa2-48db-862b-6202b76eb692' updated_at=2025-09-08T14:43:06.943671+00:00>Professional Bio for Build Palestine\nCombining over 15 years of experience in social enterprises with expertise in applied positive psychology, Bilal designs innovative learning environments that empower individuals to bring their inner beauty into the world through personal and professional development.\n\nDoes this version better capture your skills and background?

I’m one of the cofounders of Bloom and it’s a partnership training program based in Lebanon. It started when I started coming to the Middle East after the Arab spring to do some training for Youth including my self as the Youth back then but now I’m older and working on social entrepreneurship training that brings personal and professional growth together in difficult context and so I initially was focusing on only entrepreneurship, but you can’t ignore the reality of the area that you’re working in and suddenly I realize we had to talk about the you know the difficulties of working in a context like Iraq and Lebanon and I haven’t had an opportunity Although I have Workshop Camp in the northern part of Syria many years ago back in 2013 we were working on shadow puppets and stories for Youth in a camp there and not necessarily it was the last time I was in Syria although I have been there in 2007 and earlier with my family when Iraq was dangerous and Syria was safe what do you think about this contract in this proposal and what information can I give you to OK, so the second email is pascal.palbe at learningplanetinstitute.org.

I focused on developing curriculum modules, delivering training to local communities, and collaborating with Iraqi experts to create new job opportunities through skill development.\nWith a strong background in grassroots innovation, sustainable development, and capacity building, I've been privileged to lead global initiatives that empower individuals and communities. From designing hands-on learning software at BLOOM to shaping innovation-focused programs at The Nawaya Network, my work is rooted in creating meaningful, lasting impact.\n\nI remain dedicated to leveraging my skills and experience to further projects that align with my core values—education, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate on initiatives that can drive real change.\n\nBilal Ghalib is the co-founder and Head of Research at Bloom. He has over 15 years of experience in social enterprises and holds a Master's in Learning Sciences from the Universite de Paris. He’s currently consulting with the UN’s International Trade Center to design learning experiences for sustainable reconstruction post-conflict. His work at Bloom focuses on creating community-oriented, online learning environments that support personalized, self-paced learning and inquiry-based education for marginalized communities. For the last year, he has trained over 100 NGOs and social enterprises on using LLMs for learning and development. Bilal has facilitated workshops and talks across Lebanon and the Middle East.\n(this is updated to include ITC and removes UNESCO reference)\n\nseems like it's too long, can it be shorter?\n\nAssistant:  Here's a concise bio for Build Palestine that captures your essence:\n\n**English Bio:**\n\nBilal Ghalib is an Iraqi-American social entrepreneur who co-founded Bloom, supporting 933 ventures across 16 countries. Currently consulting with the UN's International Trade Center in Iraq, he develops curricula that bridge Islamic architectural heritage with modern green building practices—connecting past wisdom with future sustainability. With a Master's from Université de Paris focused on post-traumatic growth, Bilal has spent 15 years designing transformative learning experiences in conflict zones, from Syrian refugee camps to post-explosion Beirut. His work integrates Eastern and Western approaches, traditional knowledge and modern technology, creating educational frameworks that help communities build resilience while honoring their heritage. An INK Fellow (2012) and participant in the Dalai Lama's Compassionate Leadership Summit, he brings both technical expertise in AI and deep cultural understanding to foster innovation that respects tradition.\n\n**Arabic Bio:**\n\nبلال غالب رائد أعمال اجتماعي عراقي-أمريكي، شارك في تأسيس \"بلوم\" التي دعمت 933 مشروعاً عبر 16 دولة.</chat>\n\n<chat url='https://claude.ai/chat/57acb161-4642-4d7c-94d6-3be80685b273' updated_at=2025-10-01T21:53:37.639751+00:00>Personal bio writing\nHe lives in Lille with his family and works between Europe and the SWANA region.\n\nThe Arab Spring pulled him from Michigan into the Middle East to work with youth—helping seed community innovation spaces through GEMSI in Cairo, Beirut, and Baghdad, then bridging grassroots makers with global sustainability at Autodesk. He believed in co-creating futures through creativity and collaboration. Then violence became personal. The burnout that followed forced a reckoning: Why was he doing this work? What makes an intention good? What is a good life? What is actually true?\n\nHe explored developmental psychology, mental complexity theory, Ken Wilber, Teal organizations, positive psychology—frameworks that helped him understand growth, values, consciousness. But during the pandemic's pause, he realized what was missing. These traditions mapped stages of the mind beautifully but left out an entire dimension: the heart. Not emotion—what Muslim tradition calls heart-perception, the faculty that accesses beauty, goodness, and truth at their source, rooted in the Divine. Reconnecting with Islam after years of intellectual searching gave him something those frameworks couldn't: metaphysical confidence. A tradition with deep roots, grounded in stable reality, finally being brought into contemporary conversation through scholars like Malik Badawi, Rania Awaad, Abdullah Rothman, and the Islam and Psychology movement.\n\nIn 2016 he co-founded Bloom, and the design emerged from this integrated understanding: inner well-being and outer well-doing rise together. As Head of Learning & Research, he shaped Bloom's community-first, non-competitive accelerators to pair reflective storywork and resilience practices with practical venture tools. Weekly peer circles put finances and mental health at the same table—because they belong there. Since 2016, Bloom has supported 1,000+ founders across SWANA and Africa and grown a bilingual network of mentors, trainers, and partners.\n\nHis subsequent work flows from the same conviction that healing and building are one motion. With the UN International Trade Centre he co-designed curricula connecting heritage, sustainable construction, and dignity in reconstruction. With Nawaya in Lebanon he facilitated design-thinking with refugee youth. Most recently he's supported educators at School Without Borders in Gaza, integrating Qur'anic reflection and gratitude practices with post-traumatic growth frameworks for teachers creating pop-up schools for displaced children.\n\nSince 2014, Bilal has been part of the Ecosystem Network, contributing to the Wellbeing Project and now the WHEN network, which brings wellbeing practices into higher education and organizations.\n\nAt Cambridge Muslim College, he's deepening his study of a tradition that claims to be—and he believes can be—a healing for the hearts of humanity. His work aims to bring forward those gems: practically, rigorously, in service. He is fluent in Arabic and English.</chat>",

            "text": "Based on our conversation history and your documents, here's my honest assessment of your position:\n\n## Your Strategic Position\n\n**Strong Hand:**\n- You literally just won a contract with Five One Labs for climate curriculum integration - you have fresh credibility and a working relationship\n- Your winning proposal demonstrated you understand their context (KRI/Erbil), their format (bootcamp structure), and can deliver in tight timeframes\n- Your pedagogical design expertise and Masters in Education Sciences from Université de Paris gives you theoretical grounding\n- Your Bloom work (933+ ventures across 16 countries) shows you understand entrepreneurship training at scale\n- Your Arabic fluency and SWANA experience means you can genuinely localize content, not just translate it\n\n**Honest Gaps:**\n- Unless I'm missing something, you don't have deep food systems expertise. This isn't fatal - they're asking for curriculum adaptation, not food science - but it's a vulnerability\n- The impact measurement framework requirement is specific. Your previous proposal didn't emphasize M&E expertise heavily\n- This is a 4-day bootcamp vs your 32-session experience. That's actually harder - compression requires different skills\n\n**The Real Pitch:**\nThink of it like jazz versus classical music. You've proven you can write a full symphony (32 sessions). Now they're asking if you can improvise a tight 4-day set that hits all the emotional notes. Your advantage is that you understand Five One Labs' audience deeply from your climate work - you know what resonates with KRI entrepreneurs.\n\n## 5 Questions for Context:\n\n1. **Food systems experience**: Have you done ANY work touching food systems, agriculture, supply chains, or food security - even tangentially? (I need to know how to frame any connection, or whether we lean into \"fresh eyes + research synthesis\" as a strength)\n\n2. **Impact measurement**: What's your actual experience designing impact frameworks and metrics? Can you point to specific examples where you created measurement systems that tracked outcomes beyond participation numbers?\n\n3. **Research synthesis**: The TOR emphasizes extracting insights from three research reports. Do you have access to those reports yet? If not, when do you expect them?\n\n4. **Training-of-Trainers**: Your climate proposal didn't include ToT. What's your actual experience facilitating ToT sessions? (I found EON ToT work in our history, but need specifics)\n\n5. **Budget reality check**: Your climate contract was 4M IQD for 5 weeks. This is 6 weeks but seems more complex (research synthesis + bootcamp redesign + materials + impact framework + ToT). What are you thinking price-wise, and what's your read on their budget range?",

Now I have a good collection of research reports. Let me organize the 6 best ones for Bilal to review, and then I'll help him think through his positioning and budget. Let me create a clear summary of the research reports and then help with the proposal strategy.Perfect! I found some strong research. Now let me organize this for you and help you think through the budget and positioning.\n\n## 6 Research Reports for Your Review:\n\n**1. UNEP Food Waste Index Report 2024** ⭐ **MUST HAVE**\n- Global food waste measurement methodology + SDG 12.3 tracking\n- Includes Middle East data, measurement frameworks, and impact indicators\n- Provides the \"official\" language and metrics you'll need\n- [Access here](https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/food-waste-index-report-2024)\n\n**2. Food waste in Iraqi restaurants (Filimonau et al., 2023)** ⭐ **HIGHLY RELEVANT**\n- **Actual Iraq-specific data**: 38g per capita food waste in Iraqi restaurants\n- Cultural factors: hospitality culture, large portions, over-ordering\n- Novel/effective approaches for Middle East market\n- This is gold for understanding Erbil context\n\n**3. FAO Food Loss and Waste in Arab World (systematic review, 2018)**\n- **Critical stat**: 210 kg per capita annually in Arab countries vs 95-115kg in Europe\n- Data gaps in 10 Arab countries including Iraq\n- Food bank initiatives and redistribution models in the region\n- Shows the opportunity space\n\n**4. Traditional Iraqi Fermented Foods (Journal of Ethnic Foods, 2022)** ⭐ **YOUR SECRET WEAPON**\n- Documents Iraq's 7500 BC food preservation tradition\n- Basturma, Turshi, date products, fermentation techniques\n- **Low commercialization** = entrepreneurship opportunity!\n- Connects to your grandmother's knowledge angle\n\n**5. Circular Economy & Food Waste (ReFED + UNCTAD reports)**\n- Entrepreneurship frameworks for food waste\n- Business Model Canvas adaptations for circular economy\n- Case studies of food waste social enterprises\n- Impact measurement approaches\n\n**6. NRC Iraq Drought & Food Security Report (Nov 2024)** ⭐ **CURRENT CONTEXT**\n- 1 in 2 Iraqi households cultivated less land in 2024\n- 59% reduced food expenditure\n- Climate-food security-income nexus\n- Shows urgency and context for the work\n\n## Your Honest Positioning - How to Frame It:\n\n**DON'T say**: \"I'm a food systems expert\"\n\n**DO say**: \"I specialize in curriculum adaptation for complex topics I don't initially know deeply - I've done this successfully with solar energy, insulation, and green architecture for ITC. My strength is synthesis: taking research findings and translating them into practical entrepreneurship tools that work in SWANA contexts.\"\n\n**Your Unique Angle** (this is actually brilliant):\n\"I want to integrate traditional Iraqi food preservation knowledge - which dates back 7500 years but risks being lost - with modern circular economy approaches. Entrepreneurs in Erbil don't just need Western frameworks; they need to see how their grandmothers' techniques (fermentation, sun-drying, date preservation) are actually cutting-edge circular economy practices.\"\n\nThis positions your \"gap\" as a **feature, not a bug**. You're not pretending to be a food scientist - you're positioning as someone who connects indigenous knowledge with modern entrepreneurship frameworks.\n\n## Budget Strategy & Breakdown:\n\n**Context check:**\n- Climate project: 4M IQD for 5 weeks, single deliverable stream\n- This project: 6 weeks, MORE complex (research synthesis + curriculum + materials + impact framework + ToT)\n- Question: In-person or remote?\n\n**My recommendation:** \nPrice at **4.5M - 5M IQD** (~$3,400-$3,800 USD) for remote work. If they want in-person facilitation in Erbil, add 1.3M IQD ($1,000) = **5.8M-6.3M IQD total**.\n\nHere's a transparent breakdown:\n\n| **Deliverable** | **Remote (IQD)** | **Notes** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Research Synthesis & Integration** | 1,200,000 | Review 3 research reports + 6 background sources, extract actionable insights, create integration outline |\n| **Curriculum Adaptation (4-day bootcamp)** | 1,800,000 | Adapt Five One Labs bootcamp format, integrate food waste/security content, develop exercises linking to entrepreneurship tools |\n| **Training Materials Development** | 1,000,000 | Slides, trainer guides, participant workbooks, case studies (localized + global) |\n| **Impact Framework Design** | 700,000 | Develop measurement system: kg saved, households reached, business outcomes, data collection tools |\n| **Training-of-Trainers Session** | 800,000 | Virtual ToT session + prep materials |\n| **TOTAL (Remote)** | **5,500,000** | ~$4,200 USD |\n\n| **If In-Person Required** | **Additional** |\n|---|---|\n| Travel to Erbil + accommodation | +1,300,000 | ~$1,000 USD |\n| **TOTAL (In-Person)** | **6,800,000** | ~$5,200 USD |\n\n**Reality Check**: Are they likely to hire someone from France?\n- **Yes, if**: You emphasize your Five One Labs track record, Kurdistan Region familiarity, Arabic fluency, and recent successful delivery\n- **No, if**: They have budget constraints and strong local options\n\n**My advice**: **Propose remote-first with optional in-person**. Say: \"I can deliver all work remotely with excellent results, as demonstrated in my climate curriculum project. However, if budget allows, an in-person ToT session in Erbil would strengthen trainer capacity and allow for real-time troubleshooting.\"\n\n## Key Questions Before I Draft:\n\n1. **Do you want to actually pitch the traditional knowledge integration angle?** It's risky (could seem unfocused) but also potentially differentiating.\n\n2. **Translation**: The TOR doesn't mention it. Your climate project did. Should we include basic Arabic/Kurdish glossaries or skip it?\n\n3. **Timeline**: They say 6 weeks. Can you do end of October through early December? Or do you need different dates?\n\n4. **The research reports they mention**: Do you want me to email them asking for access to the three research phase reports, or wait until they provide them?\n\n5. **Your friend in agriculture/food work**: Is this someone you could list as a \"technical advisor\" to strengthen your food systems credibility?\n\nWhat do you think about this framing? Should I draft the proposal now, or do you want to adjust the positioning/budget first?",

Measuring food waste allows countries to comprehend the magnitude of the issue, thereby revealing the size of the opportunity, while establishing a baseline for tracking progress. The Food Waste Index Report 2021 marked a pivotal moment in understanding global food waste across retail, food service, and household sectors. It unveiled a greater availability of food waste data than anticipated, particularly at the household level, and revealed that per capita household food waste generation was more consistent worldwide than previously thought. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 builds upon its predecessor in three key ways: Firstly, it incorporates vastly expanded data points from around the world, providing a significantly more robust global and national estimates, detailed in Chapter 2 of the main report.\n\nThe Food Waste Index Report 2024 builds upon its predecessor in three key ways: Firstly, it incorporates vastly expanded data points from around the world, providing a significantly more robust global and national estimates, detailed in Chapter 2 of the main report. Secondly, it expands on the SDG 12.3 food waste measurement methodology introduced in the 2021 report, offering enhanced guidance on measurement across retail, food service, and household sectors. This additional guidance delves into various methodologies, their strengths and limitations, and strategies for prioritising sub-sectors for measurement, as explored in Chapter 3. Lastly, the report transitions from focusing solely on food waste measurement to exploring solutions for food waste reduction. The chapter examines effective approaches to reducing food waste globally, with a spotlight on public-private partnerships in this 2024 report.",

It responds to the Food Waste Index report 2021 by the United Nations Environment Programme which has called for more accurate data-based assessments of wastage in national foodservice sectors of developing nations. Via mixed methods research design consisting of direct measurements, in-situ observations and managerial interviews, the study provides first preliminary benchmarks of food waste in three categories of Iraqi restaurants and explains the reasons for discrepancy in estimates. The study showcases national culture as one of the main underlying causes of food waste in Iraqi foodservices. The study highlights the approaches to food waste management that can be categorised as novel/effective for the market of the Middle East.\n\n... However, our findings did not reveal a significant impact of economic levels on food waste at canteen, while their clear impacts on food waste can be observed at the non-buffet restaurant. More specifically, food waste at non-buffet restaurants can reach 154.8 g per capita in developed countries like the UK, significantly higher than the 93 g per capita in China, 38 g per capita in Iraq, and 35.1 g per capita in Thailand (Wang et al., 2017;Filimonau et al., 2021; Filimonau et al., 2023;Junkrachang et al., 2024). More food waste would occur at the restaurants with higher economic level. ... Food waste and its associated environmental impacts in workplace buffet-style canteens in Beijing, China ... Introduction Food waste is a significant global challenge, with critical implications for food security, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and human health.\n\nFilimonau et al. (2023) have demonstrated the insignificant effect of personal norm on intention of foodservice customers to reduce FW in Iraq, a country where consumer awareness of FW is low while governmental policies on FW remain immature. ... Religious values and social distance as activators of norms to reduce food waste when dining out ... Empirical research is required to identify psychological and psychographic factors which can activate or amplify norms of foodservice customers towards food waste reduction. By surveying 446 foodservice customers in Poland, a country with a large population of religion followers, this study examines the influence of religious values on personal norms and explores the moderating effect of social distance on injunctive norms. The results indicate that religious values do not activate personal norms directly but affect them indirectly via such mediating factors as the feeling of compassion and family upbringing.\n\n... Remarkably, studies on FW in the food service sector have been conducted in only 28 out of the 233 countries where food is consumed outside the home, covering a mere 12% coverage, according to dhir et al. (2020) and UneP (2021). notably, only nine countries are classified as developing: china, egypt, india, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand, iraq, and the United arab emirates (dhir et al., 2020; Filimonau et al., 2023). ... ... additionally, improper storage practices, such as co-storing incompatible fruits and vegetables or contamination from ethylene gas, can accelerate spoilage (derqui & Fernandez, 2017). inefficient stock rotation systems further exacerbate waste · (Filimonau et al., 2023). Misinterpretations of expiration dates, coupled with an excessive focus on food safety, can result in unnecessary discarding of food (derqui et al., 2018).",

To galvanize the necessary action on food waste reduction to achieve SDG 12.3, it is crucial to understand how much food waste there is. Measuring food waste enables countries to understand the scale of the problem – and therefore, the size of the opportunity – while providing a baseline against which progress can be measured. The Food Waste Index Report 2021 was an important moment in the understanding of food waste at the retail, food service and household sectors globally. It demonstrated higher global availability of food waste data than expected, particularly at the household level, and that per capita household food waste generation was more comparable across the world than was previously understood.\n\nThis Food Waste Index Report 2024 builds on the 2021 report in three ways: 1) New data has been used to develop a new estimate of global food waste. This is covered in chapter 2 of the main report. 2) This report builds on the SDG 12.3 food waste measurement methodology published in the Food Waste Index Report 2021, providing more detailed guidance on measurement at the retail, food service and household sectors. The additional guidance explores different methodologies, their strengths and limitations and how to effectively prioritize subsectors for measurement. This is covered in chapter 3. 3) The report starts to move from food waste measurement to food waste reduction. The “Solutions Focus” chapter explores effective approaches to food waste reduction around the world.

With a population of 30.8 million according to World Bank data (WB, 2015), the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has seen fast urbanization, industrialization, and population growth in recent decades, which has resulted in a notable increase in the generation of solid waste (Gajalakshmi et al. 2008). The average annual rate of population growth over the past forty years has been 3.4%, with urbanization rising from 50 to 80% of the total population between 1970 and the present. As a result, the production of uncontrolled solid waste has significantly increased (Ouda et al. 2013), with the majority of this trash being generated in the eight major cities of Saudi Arabia (Table 1).",

Integrating comprehensive measures to tackle food waste within National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) is another opportunity for fostering sustainable development, actioning target 16 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which specifically calls out halving global food waste by 2030.  · Food waste must be addressed at both individual and systemic levels, including targeted efforts in urban areas and international collaboration among countries and across supply chains.

In Tunisia, the Banque Alimentaire Durable dispensed food aid to needy families during the month of Ramadan and beyond, while in Lebanon, the non-governmental organization Abaad fielded nearly twice as many calls on its domestic abuse helpline in the first four months of the year than it did over the whole of 2019. This ability to deliver emergency relief to areas underserved by governments and the market could see investment in social enterprises remain relatively steady and perhaps even grow, a June survey by New York-based Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) revealed. Impact investment, valued at $715 billion worldwide, is defined as the funding of projects that generate a positive social or environmental outcome.\n\n“Most social enterprises not only survived during the COVID-19 pandemic but also thrived. This proves that companies creating change are the future.” · C3 runs accelerator programs on sustainability in 11 countries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey (MENAT). It aims to help entrepreneurs working toward realizing at least one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to maximize their social impact and ensure their financial stability. ... Nocentini noted that there had been an increased interest in regional companies creating a positive impact and a better understanding of their business models. “Investors used to view these companies as small initiatives or non-profit organizations. However, the pandemic made them realize that companies who are seeking to create a positive impact are scalable, sustainable, resilient, and indeed investable,” she added.\n\nAt present, there is just one non-profit social organization for every 10,000 people in Saudi Arabia, compared to about 50 in Canada and the US, and 200 in France, PwC said. The consultancy sees social enterprises as a promising way to help the Kingdom achieve the ambitious economic transformation outlined in its Vision 2030 development plan. Whether in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere, impact investing can lead to a more equitable distribution of resources, while generating social, environmental, and economic returns. • The Middle East Exchange is one of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Global Initiatives that was launched to reflect the vision of the UAE prime minister and ruler of Dubai in the field of humanitarian and global development, to explore the possibility of changing the status of the Arab region. The initiative offers the press a series of articles on issues affecting Arab societies.\n\n“Until COVID-19, there was little or no interest among Middle Eastern venture capital firms to invest in life sciences and healthcare. Today, we see several of the big venture capitalists (VCs) pivoting away from e-commerce, marketplaces, logistics, and fintech (financial technology) to focus almost exclusively on healthtech,” she said. “VCs are recognizing the need to invest in accessible and affordable healthcare for people across the region, to enhance overall population health and protect against future pandemics.” · The general consensus among social impact companies, she added, was that the COVID-19 pandemic had made it easier to attract investment, not the other way round. ... “The closing of borders and suspension of trade has made governments realize the importance of building local, sustainable businesses, with a particular focus on food and population health security.",

These initiatives also promote a sense of community solidarity...\n\nFood waste is a major issue that affects the environment, the economy, and society at large. Food waste management has become a crucial concern in the context of Saudi Arabia, a nation undergoing fast economic expansion and shifting consumer patterns. This thorough analysis looks at the options and problems related to food waste in Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the effects on the country’s economy and ecology. The report starts by describing the extent of food waste in Saudi Arabia, using studies and statistics that are currently accessible to provide readers a clear picture of the problem’s scope. The main causes of food waste in the nation are then identified, including dietary habits, supply chain inefficiencies, cultural norms, and a lack of infrastructure for food recovery and redistribution. It also looks into the financial effects, including what it costs for individuals, companies, and the government, as well as any possible profits from programs to recycle and reduce food waste.\n\nIn the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), food redistribution programs like those run by The It’aam Food Charitable Society are essential for reducing food insecurity and eliminating food waste. By distributing extra food to people in need, these programs not only assist minimize food waste but also uphold the charitable traditions of Islam, which emphasize compassion and social responsibility. The formation of food banks in several KSA cities, in addition to individual initiatives aimed at curbing food waste and aiding the underprivileged, is indicative of the proactive stance citizens have taken in addressing societal issues. A dignified solution for those experiencing food insecurity is offered by programs like the installation of communal refrigerators, where anyone can donate and obtain food anonymously. These initiatives also promote a sense of community solidarity.\n\nSecond, to reduce food waste at every level of the supply chain—from production and distribution to consumption and disposal—targeted interventions should be the main focus of future efforts. This could entail creating laws and rules to promote waste minimization, making infrastructure investments for the recovery and redistribution of food, and encouraging sustainable consumption habits. Thirdly, there is a need for increased coordination and cooperation between all parties involved, which includes companies, consumers, civil society organizations, and government authorities. Together, these parties can make the most of their combined knowledge and assets to put practical solutions into place and bring about significant change. In summary, tackling food waste in Saudi Arabia necessitates a multifaceted strategy that incorporates social, economic, and environmental factors.\n\nConversely, food loss is the amount of food that is lost after harvesting but before it is ready for human consumption (Roodhuyzen et al. 2017). Food loss is defined by the FAO for the purposes of this study, which includes losses that occur from post-harvest through the retail level but excludes losses beyond that (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO. 2019). According to the UNEP, food waste happens in retail, food service, and consumer settings. Research has shown that, mostly as a result of consumer behavior, the percentage of food wasted is far larger than the percentage of food lost (Sobaih 2023). The management of food waste in Saudi Arabia (SA), specifically in food service enterprises, is the main emphasis of the current study. Food waste has become a major global concern that affects social justice, economic viability, and environmental sustainability.",

By Gilbert Doumit Jan. 27, 2017 · As a Lebanese born and raised in Beirut on a small street in Gemmayze that used to sit on the iconic Green Line—a strip of buildings and streets overgrown with foliage that marked a no-man's land between warring factions during the Lebanese Civil War—I spent much of my time waiting in line to fill containers with water or buy a loaf of bread. Sometimes we played cards in an underground building when bombs dropped instead of going to school. The level of solidarity that existed between the people in my neighborhood saved many of us from hunger, thirst, and even death. This solidarity was not only driven by survival, but also grounded in a culture perhaps best described by the proverb Aljar kabel aldar (“Your neigh\n\nVariety of legal frameworks: Within the region, social enterprises lack a legal framework that defines them in the marketplace. They are sometimes informal, and when they are registered, they tend to establish themselves under a variety of legal forms, including non-governmental organizations, private businesses, cooperatives, civil companies, or some combination of these. For example, an online education social enterprise in Egypt established both a corporation to generate revenue without being prosecuted by government and a nonprofit to access international donor funding so that it could scale up in less-privileged areas. Contextual definition of social innovation: Social problems vary widely between countries, and between the urban and rural areas of each country. The social innovation and social business models people develop are thus highly adapted to the unique social, economic, and cultural challenges of their locality.\n\nSocial Enterprise Outcome: This dimension is concerned with social impact and innovation within the political, social, economic, and cultural contexts of each country. A social enterprise is focused on the social impact it aspires to achieve, rather than profit, and on improving the living conditions for marginalized and less-privileged groups and communities. A social enterprise also offers innovative solutions to a social problem at the business model, production, and distribution levels. Social Enterprise Governance: This dimension differs between countries based on the most suitable legal frameworks for the social enterprise business model. These frameworks help ensure that the enterprise is financial sustainable and its governance is participatory in nature. Social Entrepreneur Agency: This dimension is critical for the credibility and legitimacy of people aspiring to start their own social enterprises within communities, which often feature strong social proximities and weak form\n\nIt binds together villages that suffer from poverty and lack access to basic services. And in many of these places, local citizens and refugees are generating innovative ideas and transforming them into enterprises that provide education, health care, and clean water. Over the last six months, my colleagues and I visited six countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region—including Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria—to study social entrepreneurship ecosystems, and to my surprise, I have observed an entrepreneurial dynamic similar to Lebanon’s in many of these areas. As part of a mapping mission to support social enterprise ecosystems in the Southern Mediterranean countries, we interviewed more than 100 individuals, including social entrepreneurs, public officials, leading figures in incubators, financial institutions, and international organizations.",

Subsidizing inputs, such as seed and fertilizers, and food directly or indirectly through energy subsidies35 accounts for a large share of public spending and is unsusta...\n\nFood Access Levels Vary among Countries and Social Segments: Some countries suffer from conflict and financial constraints that further decrease their food security. Marginalized groups, including women and low-income households, experience lower levels of food security. Climate Change and Structural Factors Are Leading Causes of Food Insecurity: Structural issues, such as unsustainable agricultural practices and lack of rural development, along with the intensifying effects of climate change are heightening the state of food insecurity. Developing Research Capacities Is Key to Increasing Food Production: MENA should focus on increasing its domestic food production capacities and using its resources efficiently. This will require further investment in agricultural research and technology that can address existing challenges. Food insecurity1 has become a pressing issue worldwide.\n\nEnvironmental factors affect domestic agriculture which still lacks the innovation levels needed to use meager resources efficiently and deal with growing environmental stresses. In addition, agricultural strategies in most countries of the region focus on producing and exporting cash crops,32 which consume a large share of water and arable land, while importing staple foods. These issues are exacerbated by a lack of rural development and policy consistency, social stigmas associated with agricultural work, and lower expected earnings for neglected small-scale farmers. Together, these factors have contributed to one of the highest urbanization rates in the world, combined with high rural-urban migration and farmer displacement rates.33 The region also has one of the highest population growth rates in the world,34 meaning demand for food will keep growing while resources are being depleted and production prospects stray.\n\nSimultaneously, food supply chains in most countries of the region rely predominately on fossil fuel-derived inputs and fertilizers, global commodities imports, and industrial-based food. This reliance trickles down the supply chain, affecting land preparation, production, processing, distribution, and storage and heavily linking the industry to the global energy market. Moreover, the industry is also vulnerable to external shocks impacting global markets and prices, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Food chains in the region also tend to be overregulated and price-controlled through rigid subsidy systems put in place to avoid social grievances such as the bread riots in Tunisia in the early 1980s. Subsidizing inputs, such as seed and fertilizers, and food directly or indirectly through energy subsidies35 accounts for a large share of public spending and is unsustainable.\n\nResearch can also serve as a platform for the region to develop technology from within, which would address one of the major barriers to widescale adoption of existing agricultural-technological solutions—the high costs associated with it.55 Moreover, research can address the gaps in data availability across the region. While data collection is on the rise in the region, significant gaps are hindering the process of establishing nuanced responses to the issues of food insecurity facing MENA countries. When assessing the state of food security in Palestine, through the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia’s (ESCWA) monitoring framework, most of the indicators lacked the data necessary.56 Without such data, it is difficult to evaluate the state of food insecurity. Accordingly, countries of the region with higher capacities could pave the way by playing a role in the process of data collection and dissemination, along with investing in the infrastructure and resources necessary",

These estimates are generated through a non-linear beta regression model that bridges machine learning and statistical inference.  · The implementation extends the core WFSO framework, which employs the Cubist algorithm—a decision-tree-based ensemble model with local linear approximations. The beta regression applies an additional non-linear transformation at the final output stage to map FIES-scale predictions onto the standardized IPC scale, maintaining all assumptions of the original model while enhancing the interpretation of predictions. In practical terms, the underlying prediction model remains identical to the one producing the main prevalence rates in the WFSO, with only a final re-scaling step to translate these rates onto an IPC-compatible scale.\n\nRecognizing this challenge, the teams working on the World Bank's forthcoming MENAAP flagship report on food and nutrition security (2026) is introducing new indicators to further expand the WFSO dataset. These are designed to improve cross-country comparability and equip policymakers with the information needed for proactive, aligned, and evidence-based decision-making.  · To strengthen food security monitoring and comparability across the region, the WFSO now incorporates two additional innovative indicators.  · Previously, the World Bank measured short-term caloric needs by estimating the annual cost of safety nets necessary to meet 25% of minimum dietary energy requirements for severely food-insecure populations, following methods first used in IDA-19. This indicator has now been developed further to express these costs as a share of country GDP.\n\nThe upcoming MENAAP flagship report on food and nutrition security, set for Spring 2026, will provide deeper analysis and policy recommendations to guide regional decision-makers, including detailed methodological notes. Meanwhile, the global community is encouraged to explore and use the available data now.  · These innovative tools are designed to help countries worldwide assess food security conditions more accurately, allocate resources more efficiently, and coordinate cross-border interventions. By providing timely and comparable data, they empower governments and international partners to respond proactively to emerging crises and build long-term resilience.  · Why Better Food Security Data Matters Learn more about the role of better data systems in combating hunger: Five Alarming Stats on Global Hunger (blog) From Data to Preparedness Watch how these initiatives support early action and planning: Preparedness Plans (YouTube)  ·",

She transformed organic waste into sustainable animal feed, launching the “EcoFeed” project, which has since become a model of environmental innovation and an effective tool to support […]\n\n“The dream of entrepreneurship has been with me since I was a child, and I truly want to make a difference in my field and in my country… I want my name to be remembered in the history of this nation.” These heartfelt words, filled with pride and determination, were shared by 28-year-old entrepreneur Malek Boukthir from Gabes in southeastern Tunisia, who holds a PhD in chemical engineering. She didn’t stop at her academic work, which focused on environmental protection and the sustainable use of resources. Instead, she began to question the fate of organic waste from Tunisia’s food industries. That’s when the idea came to her: turning this waste into animal feed. Malek’s dream began in her childhood, in rural Gabes, where she watched her uncle care for his cows every morning, feeding them by hand and calling them by name as if they were his daughters.\n\nIn an era when the planet is suffocating under the weight of human pollution—and in Gabes, a heavily industrialized region—Malek chose to listen to the voice of the Earth. What began as a crisis on a small family farm has grown into a national project redefining the meaning of food, innovation, and agricultural dignity. EcoFeed is not just a place where animal feed is made—it is a promise that powerful solutions can sprout from modest wounds, when watered with a woman’s dream, science, and unshakable belief. ...

But between 2015 and 2018, Tunisia faced a severe fodder crisis, making it difficult to feed livestock. Her uncle was often forced to sell one cow to feed the others, which was heartbreaking. Deeply moved by this hardship, Malek conceived the idea of “EcoFeed” — a project that plants hope, turns waste into resources, and transforms sorrow into solutions. The goal of the project is to offer an environmentally friendly and economically viable local alternative to imported feed, which is often expensive for small farmers in Tunisia. At the same time, it aims to reduce the agricultural sector’s carbon footprint by locally recycling organic waste. The EcoFeed project is grounded in genuine sustainability. ... Although the project idea was unique, its founder had to revise it multiple times before arriving at a viable and successful model.\n\nFounded by Malek Boukthir, EcoFeed operates based on a circular and innovative model that transforms organic waste into low-cost, natural animal feed—supporting both farmers and the environment. The project collects waste from fish, fruits, vegetables, and olive byproducts sourced from markets and local factories. These are then processed scientifically through drying, fermentation, and biological mixing under the supervision of experts in chemical engineering and animal nutrition. The result is a protein-rich local feed suitable for cows, sheep, and poultry, serving as an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to imported feed. But EcoFeed goes beyond production. It revitalizes the local economy by reintegrating waste into the economic cycle, reducing pollution, and creating green jobs. The project also utilizes clean energy sources and is working on developing mobile processing units to serve remote areas.",

The need for this area of study is supported by the trends and incentives to use less materials while still fulfilling the demands of the global economy. The European Union produces more than 2.1 billion tonnes of waste each year. In response to this, the EU wants to promote a shift to a more sustainable model known as the circular economy. This means finding ways to produce and consume goods and services while minimizing environmental impact and resource depletion. The principles of a circular economy, such as reduce, reuse, recycle, are increasingly relevant in addressing these challenges. Circularity and sustainability must be incorporated in all stages of a value chain to achieve a fully circular economy: from design to production and all the way to the consumer.\n\nAs businesses strive to meet the challenges and demands of global warming and climate change, there is an increased requirement for qualified individuals with the knowledge and competencies needed to develop and adapt business models, and meet sustainability targets and best practice.

Objective 2: Prevent food waste....\n\nHere in New York City, we have been working on recycling food waste for over a decade. We’ve also been trying to rescue food for over forty years. It’s a topic closely related to the development of an urban circular economy. Since 2013, large commercial ventures in New York City have been required to separate and recycle their food waste. Since commercial waste disposal is not provided by the New York City Sanitation Department, most of the food waste is recycled by private carting and disposal firms under contract to restaurants and other food-related businesses. If a food business has the capacity, they are permitted to recycle food waste themselves and can even recycle food on-site. Businesses can also donate food that is still fresh enough to be eaten. Over the past year or so, the Department of Sanitation has begun to implement residential food waste recycling.\n\n“…the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, announced the “National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling Organics” as part of President Biden’s whole-of-government approach to tackle climate change, feed people, address environmental justice, and promote a circular economy. The strategy released today provides tangible goals that the U.S. government partners along with retailers and consumers can work toward to help further prevent the loss and waste of food, increase recycling of food and other organic materials to support a more circular economy for all, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save households and businesses money, and build cleaner, healthier communities…. The strategy highlights four objectives: Objective 1: Prevent food loss. Objective 2: Prevent food waste.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I used to ride my bike on a path along the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn, and off in the distance, I could see the Fountain Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue Landfills rising to the sky. We called it the Brooklyn Alps and wondered if it could disrupt air navigation into Kennedy airport. I think watching that landfill grow until it was forced to close may have been the spark that lit my interest in waste management. I’ve been heavily into garbage ever since. Ultimately, I believe we will need to use robotics and artificial intelligence to mine our waste stream for resources. Over the coming decades, the price of mining the planet for resources will continue to grow along with the costs of transporting and dumping waste. The “tipping fees” at landfills continue to increase as land becomes more expensive. Mining and waste management damage our ecosystems and those “externalities” can also be quite costly.\n\nHowever, in the decades before automated waste mining technology becomes cost-effective, we have a clear opportunity to both reduce and recycle food waste. While recycling has a high failure rate, we seem to do better recycling food waste than recycling other substances. In addition to ensuring food waste is properly recycled, we need to do a better job of “rescuing” food from ever becoming waste to feed people in need. I remember looking at that growing mountain of garbage accumulating in Brooklyn and wondering if any of the stuff dumped there could have been used.  · Even the U.S. federal government has begun to recognize the opportunity presented by food waste. Last week, it announced a strategy on food waste that will be implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of Agriculture.",

These include sharing business models like Hello Tractor, which allows small farmers in Africa to share the equipment they need when they need it, and Kabadiwalla Connect, which uses digital and cloud technologies to bridge the gap between informal waste collection and formal waste processing in India. Also in the spotlight are “agripreneurs” introducing innovative techniques to minimize soil degradation and improve crop yields, helping to improve food security and allow ecosystems to regenerate. For example, start-ups such as Samudra Oceans are using artificial intelligence and robotics to scale up seaweed farming and accelerate carbon sequestration – a process to reduce climate-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\n“Entrepreneurs are not just trailblazers. They’re agents of change,” says Arlette Verploegh, who leads UNCTAD’s work on entrepreneurship development. “They introduce new approaches to circular design, product life extension and effective waste management systems at the local level.” · “Their innovative products, services and business models advance circularity, triggering a domino effect throughout communities and along the entire value chain,” Ms Verploegh adds. Through a menu of policy options, the report offers a framework to overcome key challenges hindering circular innovation, especially in developing nations, such as limited access to finance and technology. It calls for more public and private sector collaboration to identify and tackle industry-specific challenges. The report also advocates for policies that are coherent and complement each other, alongside multistakeholder dialogues to better adapt rules and regulations.\n\nBeyond raising awareness, the UNCTAD emphasizes the need to enhance research and development, as well as mobilize finance and mitigate investment risks for circular economy entrepreneurs. “The report is a call for action,” Ms. Verploegh says. “It urges governments, businesses and the public to recognize the vital role that entrepreneurs play in advancing a circular economy.” · Get trusted intelligence on global trade, the economy and development in your inbox.",

The circular economy advocates for the transformation of the world’s current systems of waste production from linear processes that permanently remove precious resources from the environment—through various disposal methods such as dumping or landfilling—to a cyclical model in which resources are designed, used, and recaptured without producing any waste. The good news is that addressing food waste is promoting a circular economy. Unlike plastics, textiles, precious metals, and other materials which last longer than a product’s standard use phase or lifetime, food is intended to be completely consumed. Therefore, as much as possible, circular economy principles dictate a focus on preventing food from becoming waste in the first place. For food that is unavoidably lost from the human consumption chain, we should then treat food like these other materials whose “waste” streams represent valuable resources tha\n\nSome of the best ways to prevent food waste include optimizing distribution, upcycling byproducts into food products, honing forecasting and fulfillment, designing packaging to encourage less waste, and educating consumers on proper food management. Capturing and redistributing edible food through food rescue efforts is the best way to repurpose surplus food. When whole foods can’t be rescued, nutrients and byproducts should be saved and used to make new products, such as animal feed, compost, and digestate and biogas from anaerobic digestion. Turning food scraps into nutrient-rich compost is only half the process. Combining compost use with practices like using diverse crop varieties, cover crops, agroforestry, and rotational grazing in order to maximize soil health and limit the need for synthetic inputs is the key to creating a food economy that is circular.\n\nDetermine which actions can make the most impact depending on your role in the food system.

These fermented foods and beverages are represented by meat-, milk-, vegetable-, and fruit-based products reflecting diversity of agricultural production in ancient Iraq (Mesopotamia). Although the recipes for some fermented foods and beverages were lost throughout history, those remaining foods and beverages occupy a noticeable position in modern Iraqi cuisine. In this review, knowledge and techniques for preparation of 5 traditional fermented foods, i.e. Basturma, Smoked Liban, Aushari cheese, Turshi, and Sour Khobz, and 3 fermented beverages, i.e. Shanina, Sharbet Zbeeb, and Erk Sous in Iraq, are documented. Traditional fermented foods and beverages have multiple health benefits because of high content of probiotics and bioactive compounds. Traditional fermented foods and beverages are made using the back-slopping technique which ensures safety of production and maintains organoleptic properties.\n\nFermented foods and beverages have been popular with consumers who consider these foods and beverages important for the immune system, especially during COVID-19 [13]. Traditional fermented foods and beverages of Iraq have not been commercialized because of low public awareness of their existence alongside health benefits. This review aims to document traditional fermented foods and beverages in Iraq and explain their preparation techniques to preserve these foods and beverages for future generations. The commercialization potential of traditional fermented foods and beverages in Iraq will also be briefly discussed. Iraq (Mesopotamia) is a region in the Middle East with hot and dry summers (43 °C at day time, 26 °C at night time) and moderate winters (16 °C at day time, 2 °C at night time) which is due to its climate ranging from the Mediterranean to hot semi-arid continental [14].

Therefore, the recommended production process for enhanced safety involves the implementation of strict hygienic conditions, utilization of fresh meat, and preservation of finished product by freezing. Liban (yogurt) is traditional fermented milk produced via the lacto-fermentation process using well defined starter cultures. The history of yogurt is not well known, but scholarly evidence indicates that yogurt has originated in the Mesopotamia at around 5000 BC. [24]. In several Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq, yogurt is known as the Liban; it is consumed with bread daily as a main dish for breakfast [25]. There are several varieties of Liban in Iraq that are traditionally prepared via back-slopping fermentation and made using different types of milks including cow’s, sheep’s, and goat’s milk.\n\nThe ancient civilizations of Iraq, especially the Sumerians, believed that fermented beverages made of barley, known as beer today, could bring joy and happiness [2]. Concurrently, these civilizations developed non-alcoholic fermented beverages made of raisins, milk, and herbs. Nowadays, these beverages can be found in different regions of Iraq. This section will describe these beverages alongside their preparation methods. Shanina is a fermented homemade yogurt beverage. This beverage has several versions in the Middle Eastern countries such as Ayran in Turkey [36] and Doogh in Iran [37]. These beverages are prepared by two methods: method one requires fermenting milk for a short time to form weak curd, while method two requires fermenting milk for a long time to prepare yogurt and then diluting it with water and adding salt. Shanina in Iraq is prepared via spontaneous fermentation of cow’s milk without thermal treatment for 24 h to prepare yogurt followed by mixing the yogurt with wa",

In this article, we’ll delve deeper into the fascinating world of Middle Eastern cuisine, its history, its significance, and the importance of preserving these beloved recipes for future generations.\n\nThese ingredients, along with a range of fruits and vegetables like figs, olives, and pomegranates, became staples of the Middle Eastern diet. What makes Middle Eastern food stand out is its simple yet flavorful nature, achieved through a careful combination of local ingredients and spices. Over time, the region's cuisine was influenced by various empires, including the Persians, Ottomans, and Arabs, all of whom contributed to its culinary evolution. For instance, the Persian influence is evident in dishes like kebabs and stews, while the Ottoman Empire introduced the use of yogurt in dishes such as labneh. The spread of Islam brought about an increase in the use of spices, which are now a defining feature of Middle Eastern cuisine. At Taqwa Restaurant and Bakery, these ancient culinary influences are carefully preserved and brought to life through authentic dishes that celebrate the region’s agricultural wealth and historical significance.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of Middle Eastern cuisine is its bold use of spices. Unlike many other world cuisines, the Middle East relies on a complex mix of spices that enhance the flavors of its dishes. These spices not only elevate the taste of the food but also carry cultural and medicinal significance. From cumin and coriander to sumac and cardamom, these spices have been used for centuries to preserve food, add depth, and support health and wellness. The Middle Eastern pantry is filled with an incredible array of spices that give the food its signature flavor. Some of the most common spices include: Cumin: Known for its earthy, smoky flavor, cumin is a fundamental spice in many Middle Eastern dishes, particularly in stews, hummus, and kebabs. Coriander: The bright, citrusy flavor of coriander adds freshness to a wide range of dishes, from salads to soups.",

While these regions share historical impact and cultural exchanges there are differences that delineate each region’s dietary influences. Dietary practices are one of five core elements of an overarching Traditional Arabic and Islamic Medicine (TAIM) conceptual framework, yet current dietary guidelines are lacking. We introduce the TAIM food pyramid as a visual representation of TAIM’s historical and regional nuance, illustrate dietary patterns, and provide a cultural competency strategy. We used Oldways as a model for creating the TAIM food pyramid while illustrating its extension of a wholistic paradigm representing the medical and indigenous traditions, beliefs and practices of a geographic region and cultural community.\n\nMiddle Eastern and Mediterranean culinary tradition and dietary practices are often used interchangeably due to geographical proximity or similarities in their cuisine. While these regions share historical impact and cultural exchanges there are several differences that delineate each region’s dietary influences (Naja et al., 2015). Mediterranean cuisine typically includes those countries that border the Mediterranean Sea such as Greece, Italy, Turkey and some Arab nations in north Africa such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia (Turmo, 2012). This designation is problematic as it excludes countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. Therefore, identifying Middle Eastern cuisine as Mediterranean is lacking depth and accuracy. The population of the Arab world is approximately 500 million people (World Bank Open Data: Free and open access to global development data), with 3.7 million Americans having Middle Eastern or North Afric\n\nKeywords: Cultural competency, Food pyramid, Middle Eastern Diet, Diet Therapy, Traditional Arabic and Islamic medicine (TAIM) Traditional Arabic medicine evolved to integrate elements of Islamic medicine embodied in the scripture of the Quran and prophetic tradition, yielding a comprehensive system of medicine defined as Traditional Arabic & Islamic Medicine, or TAIM (Alrawi & Fetters, 2012). TAIM emphasizes the prevention of disease and preservation of health with treatment based on diet being a key medical intervention within this framework (Alrawi & Fetters, 2012). Traditional Arab and Islamic physicians like Avicenna, believed patients should be treated first with diet and linked the natural effects of diet, lifestyle, emotions and the environment with disease and health restoration (Choopani & Emtiazy, 2015; M. A. Khan et al., 2015; Saad, 2015).\n\nWe used Oldways (Oldways) as a model for creating a TAIM food pyramid. Oldways creates visual roadmaps to produce heritage diet pyramids. Similarly to the Oldways paradigm, the TAIM food pyramid celebrates the diversity and fusion of culinary techniques and practices of the Middle East and North Africa, yielding a tapestry of traditional Arabic dietary practices with Islamic medicine influences. In addition, the TAIM food pyramid’s dietary principles are an integral component of an overarching conceptual model and therefore an essential element of TAIM’s integrative medical system (Alrawi & Fetters, 2012). The TAIM food pyramid is an extension of a wholistic model representing the medical and indigenous traditions, beliefs and practices of a geographic region and cultural community and thereby imparting the rituals and lifestyle with which people identify and live (Alrawi & Fetters, 2012).",

Microorganisms responsible for fermentations can produce vitamins as they ferment.\n\nFood by its nature begins to spoil the moment it is harvested. Food preservation enabled ancient man to make roots and live in one place and form a community. He no longer had to consume the kill or harvest immediately, but could preserve some for later use. Each culture preserved their local food sources using the same basic methods of food preservation. In ancient times the sun and wind would have naturally dried foods. Evidence shows that Middle East and oriental cultures actively dried foods as early as 12,000 B.C. in the hot sun. Later cultures left more evidence and each would have methods and materials to reflect their food supplies—fish, wild game, domestic animals, etc. Vegetables and fruits were also dried from the earliest times. The Romans were particularly fond of any dried fruit they could make. In the Middle Ages purposely built “still houses” were created to dry fruits, vegetables and herbs in areas that did not have enough strong sunlight for drying.\n\nC. Anne Wilson. 1991.

Soon the “icehouse” became an “icebox”. In the 1800’s mechanical refrigeration was invented and was quickly put to use. Also in the late 1800’s Clarence Birdseye discovered that quick freezing at very low temperatures made for better tasting meats and vegetables. After some time he perfected his “quick freeze” process and revolutionized this method of food preservation. Fermentation was not invented, but rather discovered. No doubt that the first beer was discovered when a few grains of barley were left in the rain. Opportunistic microorganisms fermented the starch-derived sugars into alcohols. So too can be said about fruits fermented into wine, cabbage into Kim chi or sauerkraut, and so on. The skill of ancient peoples to observe, harness, and encourage these fermentations are admirable.\n\nFermentation was a valuable food preservation method. It not only could preserve foods, but it also created more nutritious foods and was used to create more palatable foods from less than desirable ingredients. Microorganisms responsible for fermentations can produce vitamins as they ferment. This produces a more nutritious end product from the ingredients. Pickling is preserving foods in vinegar (or other acid). Vinegar is produced from starches or sugars fermented first to alcohol and then the alcohol is oxidized by certain bacteria to acetic acid. Wines, beers and ciders are all routinely transformed into vinegars. Pickling may have originated when food was placed in wine or beer to preserve it, since both have a low pH. Perhaps the wine or beer went sour and the taste of the food in it was appealing. Containers had to be made of stoneware or glass, since the vinegar would dissolve the metal from pots.",

This study explores the influence of authentic dimensions and customer knowledge on the overall authenticity and revisits intention of Omani ethnic restaurants by moderating the gastronomic experience. Using a positivist approach, data were collected from 330 customers of Omani ethnic restaurants in Oman. All dimensions of authenticity (atmosphere, food, service, and price) have a positive influence on revisit intention. Concurrently, empirical evidence substantiates that customer knowledge significantly and positively impacts customers' perceptions of authenticity and revisit intention. Gastronomic experience moderates the association between overall authenticity and revisit intention. Overall authenticity mediates the influence of authenticity dimensions revisit intention, except true to self.\n\nThe study contributes to the literature on the importance of authenticity and customer knowledge in the success of ethnic restaurants.

Health, religious beliefs, and animal welfare considerations are driving more consumers to shift their dietary habits towards plant-based protein foods, making plant proteins an up-and-coming alternative to animal proteins in the current context (Greis et al., 2023; Gupta & Abu-Ghannam, 2012). Plant-based protein foods have long been important in various cultures, with examples spanning from tofu in China (Gao et al., 2024), tempeh in Indonesia (Sjamsuridzal et al., 2021), and lentils in Indian cuisine (Kaale et al., 2023), to chickpeas in Middle Eastern dishes (Savvaidis et al., 2022).

Culinary institutions serve as repositories of this knowledge, preserving traditional methods and sharing them with the wider culinary community. Emphasizing the importance of techniques, Alisha Haque-Burns, Director and Partner at SCAFA Dubai, says, “When our students progress to menu development, we encourage them to take inspiration from the culinary traditions, their home cooking, and youth.\n\nBy organizing culinary events, festivals, and workshops, culinary institutions provide platforms for chefs and food enthusiasts from different backgrounds to come together, share ideas, and collaborate. This cultural exchange encourages the adaptation and fusion of Middle Eastern flavors with other cuisines, helping to expand the global appreciation for Middle Eastern culinary heritage. Talking about what prompted her to start Mamalu Kitchen, a cookery studio, Lama Jammal Houssami says, “With three young children, I wanted to send my nanny to a cooking school to make the same heritage recipes my mom would make. When I couldn’t find a place to send her, that’s where the idea for the business came.” · Mamalu Kitchen, she adds, aims to create traditional recipes with a healthier approach for modern families. “As we don’t have the same time to dedicate to cooking as previous generations, we preserved and adapted old recipes from my mother and grandmother.” ·\n\n“Food is my artistry, therapy, and way of connecting with people. Through my culinary journey, I have discovered that the true essence of food lies in its ability to carry the rich tapestry of our family and cultural traditions,” she says. She adds her greatest inspiration and foundation in cooking comes from the influence of the women in her life, including her grandmother, mother, and mother-in-law. “Their wisdom and expertise have been passed down through generations, woven into our family’s history. In the kitchen, I learned the art of patience, the importance of intuition, and the value of preserving our culinary heritage. I was taught the family recipes, secrets, and techniques that have stood the test of time and the stories behind each dish.” · Looking ahead, Abdullah says, “My culinary education is about bridging the gap between the old and the new, traditional and modern.\n\n“The teachings from the women in my life have shaped not only my recipes but also my approach to cooking—an approach rooted in love, respect, and a deep appreciation for the stories that food can tell.” · The future of Middle Eastern cuisine lies not only in the hands of culinary institutions but also with those chefs committed to promoting cultural heritage. The continuity and evolution of Middle Eastern cuisine can be ensured by safeguarding traditional recipes, preserving culinary techniques, supporting local farmers, fostering cultural exchange, and conserving culinary rituals. As the culinary world navigates the complexities of globalization and changing culinary preferences, it is crucial to recognize the Middle East’s rich and diverse culinary heritage.

It is believed that the Middle East and the culture of oriental dynamically dried their foods in the hot sun as early as 12,000 BC; subsequently, cultures left more proof, and every culture had a diverse approach to drying their foods. The surprising reality about preserving foods is that it allowed each culture at almost every moment (Anderson 95). To subsist, the ancient people had to connect with nature.

Traditional Iraqi Fermented Foods (Journal of Ethnic Foods, 2022)** ⭐ **YOUR SECRET WEAPON**\n- Documents Iraq's 7500 BC food preservation tradition\n- Basturma, Turshi, date products, fermentation techniques\n- **Low commercialization** = entrepreneurship opportunity!\n- Connects to your grandmother's knowledge angle\n\n**5. Circular Economy & Food Waste (ReFED + UNCTAD reports)**\n- Entrepreneurship frameworks for food waste\n- Business Model Canvas adaptations for circular economy\n- Case studies of food waste social enterprises\n- Impact measurement approaches\n\n**6. NRC Iraq Drought & Food Security Report (Nov 2024)** ⭐ **CURRENT CONTEXT**\n- 1 in 2 Iraqi households cultivated less land in 2024\n- 59% reduced food expenditure\n- Climate-food security-income nexus\n- Shows urgency and context for the work\n\n## Your Honest Positioning - How to Frame It:\n\n**DON'T say**: \"I'm a food systems expert\"\n\n**DO say**: \"I specialize in curriculum adaptation for complex topics I don't initially know deeply - I've done this successfully with solar energy, insulation, and green architecture for ITC. My strength is synthesis: taking research findings and translating them into practical entrepreneurship tools that work in SWANA contexts.\"\n\n**Your Unique Angle** (this is actually brilliant):\n\"I want to integrate traditional Iraqi food preservation knowledge - which dates back 7500 years but risks being lost - with modern circular economy approaches. Entrepreneurs in Erbil don't just need Western frameworks; they need to see how their grandmothers' techniques (fermentation, sun-drying, date preservation) are actually cutting-edge circular economy practices.\"\n\nThis positions your \"gap\" as a **feature, not a bug**. You're not pretending to be a food scientist - you're positioning as someone who connects indigenous knowledge with modern entrepreneurship frameworks.\n\n## Budget Strategy & Breakdown:\n\n**Context check:**\n- Climate project: 4M IQD for 5 weeks, single deliverable stream\n- This project: 6 weeks, MORE complex (research synthesis + curriculum + materials + impact framework + ToT)\n- Question: In-person or remote?\n\n**My recommendation:** \nPrice at **4.5M - 5M IQD** (~$3,400-$3,800 USD) for remote work. If they want in-person facilitation in Erbil, add 1.3M IQD ($1,000) = **5.8M-6.3M IQD total**.\n\nHere's a transparent breakdown:\n\n| **Deliverable** | **Remote (IQD)** | **Notes** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Research Synthesis & Integration** | 1,200,000 | Review 3 research reports + 6 background sources, extract actionable insights, create integration outline |\n| **Curriculum Adaptation (4-day bootcamp)** | 1,800,000 | Adapt Five One Labs bootcamp format, integrate food waste/security content, develop exercises linking to entrepreneurship tools |\n| **Training Materials Development** | 1,000,000 | Slides, trainer guides, participant workbooks, case studies (localized + global) |\n| **Impact Framework Design** | 700,000 | Develop measurement system: kg saved, households reached, business outcomes, data collection tools |\n| **Training-of-Trainers Session** | 800,000 | Virtual ToT session + prep materials |\n| **TOTAL (Remote)** | **5,500,000** | ~$4,200 USD |\n\n| **If In-Person Required** | **Additional** |\n|---|---|\n| Travel to Erbil + accommodation | +1,300,000 | ~$1,000 USD |\n| **TOTAL (In-Person)** | **6,800,000** | ~$5,200 USD |\n\n**Reality Check**: Are they likely to hire someone from France?\n- **Yes, if**: You emphasize your Five One Labs track record, Kurdistan Region familiarity, Arabic fluency, and recent successful delivery\n- **No, if**: They have budget constraints and strong local options\n\n**My advice**: **Propose remote-first with optional in-person**. Say: \"I can deliver all work remotely with excellent results, as demonstrated in my climate curriculum project. However, if budget allows, an in-person ToT session in Erbil would strengthen trainer capacity and allow for real-time troubleshooting.\"\n\n## Key Questions Before I Draft:\n\n1. **Do you want to actually pitch the traditional knowledge integration angle?** It's risky (could seem unfocused) but also potentially differentiating.\n\n2. **Translation**: The TOR doesn't mention it. Your climate project did. Should we include basic Arabic/Kurdish glossaries or skip it?\n\n3. **Timeline**: They say 6 weeks. Can you do end of October through early December? Or do you need different dates?\n\n4. **The research reports they mention**: Do you want me to email them asking for access to the three research phase reports, or wait until they provide them?\n\n5. **Your friend in agriculture/food work**: Is this someone you could list as a \"technical advisor\" to strengthen your food systems credibility?\n\nWhat do you think about this framing? Should I draft the proposal now, or do you want to adjust the positioning/budget first?",

She's Impact Hub KL (Kuala Lumpur, not Indonesia - I should note that). She's a social investor, +SocialGood Connector, and has experience with circular economy work. The World Food Hub website shows it's focused on halal-certified food systems, blockchain, and sustainable agriculture.\n\nNow let me search for Five One Labs to understand their bootcamp format better.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nPerfect! Now I have solid context on Five One Labs:\n- They run bootcamps (2-4 days typically)\n- Focus on refugees and conflict-affected entrepreneurs in Iraq/KRI\n- Use customer discovery, business model canvas, prototyping, pitching\n- Work in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah\n- Founded 2016, now also in Colombia\n- Very community-focused, inclusive approach\n\nSmall correction: Shariha Khalid is Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), not Indonesia. But she has done work across Southeast Asia and has circular economy expertise.\n\nNow I can draft a strong proposal. Let me structure it:\n1. Opening with reference to successful climate project\n2. Understanding of this new project\n3. Request for research reports\n4. Methodology - emphasizing the traditional knowledge integration as a participatory research approach\n5. Technical team including advisors\n6. Deliverables and timeline\n7. Budget\n8. Closing\n\nLet me make this professional but warm, showing both competence and cultural understanding.Perfect! Now I'll draft your proposal. One small correction: Shariha Khalid is Impact Hub **Kuala Lumpur** (Malaysia), not Indonesia, but she has regional experience. Let me create a compelling proposal that positions your traditional knowledge integration as a methodological strength.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood! Now let me create the accompanying email that asks for their research reports and includes links to Bilal's work. This should be warm, professional, and reference the successful climate project.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGreat!

Now let me move these files to the outputs folder so Bilal can access them easily.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nPerfect! Now let me create a quick summary document that pulls it all together for Bilal.Perfect! Here's what I've created for you:\n\n## 📦 Your Complete Proposal Package\n\n[View your proposal](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/five_one_labs_proposal.md)\n\n[View your cover email](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/five_one_labs_email.md)\n\n[View your strategy notes](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/strategy_notes.md)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What I've Done\n\n**1. The Proposal (9 pages)**\n- Positions your \"gap\" as a feature (curriculum adaptation specialist, not food scientist)\n- Integrates traditional knowledge as **participatory research methodology** (not just romantic)\n- Clear deliverables: Research synthesis → Curriculum → Materials → Impact Framework → ToT\n- Budget: 5.5M IQD (~$4,200) remote, +1.3M for in-person\n- Timeline: 6 weeks, late October-early December\n\n**2. The Cover Email**\n- Warm, references your successful climate project\n- Explains why traditional knowledge integration excites you (grandmother's practices)\n- **Proactively asks for their research reports**\n- Mentions Shariha Khalid as technical advisor\n- Offers to share Bloom's work as examples\n\n**3. Strategy Notes (Your Playbook)**\n- Talking points for common objections\n- Budget justification if they push back\n- How to defend the traditional knowledge angle\n- Confidence boosters when you doubt yourself\n- What to do if they say you're expensive/inexperienced in food systems\n\n---\n\n## 💪 Your Strongest Points\n\n**Listen, here's the truth:** You're NOT trying to be a food scientist. You're a curriculum designer who specializes in taking research and making it into training that works in SWANA contexts. That's your superpower.\n\n**Your traditional knowledge angle is brilliant because:**\n- It's methodologically sound (participatory research)\n- It differentiates you from generic consultants\n- It gives entrepreneurs cultural pride (not just copying the West)\n- It creates unique business opportunities\n\n**When they ask \"But do you know food systems?\"**\nYour answer: \"I'm not a food scientist, and I'm not pretending to be. What I do is translate research into entrepreneurship training. I just proved this with your climate curriculum. I'll do it again with food systems, backed by your research reports and technical advisors like Shariha Khalid.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 The Pushback You Might Get (And How to Handle It)\n\n**\"We need food systems expertise\"**\n→ \"You need curriculum design expertise that can synthesize food systems research. That's what I do.\"\n\n**\"This is expensive\"**\n→ \"The 4-day bootcamp format is actually harder than the 32-session program—compression requires more sophisticated instructional design. I've priced transparently based on complexity. We can discuss scope if budget is tight.\"\n\n**\"Can you really do the traditional knowledge research?\"**\n→ \"That's the most exciting part! 8-10 interviews with families about turshi, date preservation, fermentation—these are circular economy practices Iraq perfected 7,500 years ago. I'm grounding your curriculum in local reality, not just importing frameworks.\"\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Key Research I Found For You\n\nWhen you get their three reports, also review these:\n\n1. **UNEP Food Waste Index 2024** - Official metrics and methodology\n2. **Filimonau et al. (2023)** - Iraqi restaurant food waste (cultural factors, 38g per capita)\n3. **Traditional Iraqi Fermented Foods (2022)** - Your traditional knowledge goldmine\n4. **NRC Iraq Drought Report (Nov 2024)** - Current food security crisis context\n5. **FAO Arab World Food Loss** - Regional data (210kg per capita vs 95kg in Europe)\n\nAll the links are in the strategy notes.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Next Steps\n\n1. **Review the proposal** - Make any tweaks that feel more authentically you\n2. **Send the email** - Attach the proposal PDF (or paste the markdown)\n3. **Follow up in 3-4 days** if no response\n4. **Prepare for a call** - They'll probably want to discuss\n5. **Be ready to be flexible** - You can adjust scope, but don't undersell\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Real Talk\n\nYou've got this. You literally JUST delivered their climate curriculum successfully. You're a co-founder of Bloom with 933+ ventures supported. You have a Master's in Education Sciences. You speak Arabic. You're Iraqi-American with deep cultural understanding.\n\n**Your \"weakness\" (not being a food systems expert) is actually your strength** - you bring fresh eyes, rigorous methodology, and proven curriculum design skills. You're not arrogant about what you don't know; you're smart about how to learn it fast and translate it for entrepreneurs.\n\nThe traditional knowledge angle is fire. It positions you as someone who respects Iraqi heritage while bringing modern frameworks. That's exactly what works in KRI.\n\n**Price yourself fairly. You're worth 5.5M IQD for this work.**\n\n---\n\n## Questions for You:\n\n1. Does the tone feel right? Too formal/informal anywhere?\n2. Should I adjust the budget numbers?\n3. Want me to draft a shorter \"lite\" proposal version in case they have budget constraints?\n4. Should we emphasize anything else about Shariha Khalid or add other advisors?\n\nWhat feels good, and what needs tweaking?",

Reflecting on the workshop’s outcomes, Stefanos Fotiou, Director of the UN Food Systems Coordination Hub, expressed optimism: “The ideas and collaboration among participants—from government, academia, stakeholders, and experts—were truly inspiring. I am confident we’ll see meaningful progress in Indonesia as a success story for convergence.” Read Stefanos’ full reflections on the workshop in his editorial.  · This short video captures key insights from the Convergence Workshop in Jakarta, featuring perspectives from Stefanos Fotiou (UN Food Systems Coordination Hub), Ifan Martino (BAPPENAS), Wahida Maghraby (Ministry of Agriculture), and Resa Ana Dina (IPB University). Hear their reflections on the workshop’s impact and the road ahead for Indonesia’s food systems transformation.\n\nJakarta, Indonesia, 6-8 November 2024 – Indonesia has taken a pioneering step in operationalizing the Convergence Initiative, becoming the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to host a National Inception Workshop for the initiative. Held in Jakarta, the three-day workshop brought together a diverse group of participants, including representatives from multiple government ministries and over 20 organizations, with attendees ranging from policymakers and technical experts to private sector leaders, youth advocates, and civil society representatives. Organized by the UN Food Systems Coordination Hub, the Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS), FAO Indonesia, and the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office, the event culminated in the development of the Convergence Action Blueprint—a strategic framework aimed at integrating food systems and climate agendas.\n\nHowever, in the world’s largest archipelago, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. This workshop is an opportunity to share insights towards a unified approach and identify how we can showcase Indonesia as a convergence model at COP30.\" Gita Sabharwal, UN Resident Coordinator in Indonesia, underscored the need for more coordinated efforts to build on this progress: “Indonesia is on a remarkable development trajectory. With 62% of SDGs on track, agriculture—contributing nearly 14% of GDP—plays a vital role, especially in less urbanized areas. Food security and sustainability remain high on the President’s agenda, alongside a commitment to reducing agricultural emissions by 8%.” · Under the new administration, two priority programs – the Free Nutritious Meals Program and the Food Production Centers Program – show great potential to deliver integrated outcomes across food security, climate resilience, and social well-being.\n\nOver the course of the workshop, participants explored how to bridge Indonesia’s food systems and climate priorities. Four thematic areas were identified for action: ... Participants identified 20 key interventions to facilitate the convergence of food systems transformation and climate actions. These interventions will be incorporated into the Convergence Action Blueprint, a comprehensive framework that outlines a shared vision, specific milestones and interventions, and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation. This collaborative approach reflects the importance of inter-ministerial dialogue, as emphasized by BAPPENAS. “The Convergence Initiative is essential for Indonesia’s food systems transformation agenda,” explained Ifan Martino, Coordinator for the Food Sector at BAPPENAS. “We have a national pathway for food systems transformation and a climate action agenda – now we need to merge these into one cohesive blueprint to maximize mutual benefits.” ·",

In this interview, Shariha speaks with Harald Friedl, the CEO of the Circle Economy, which is a social enterprise working to accelerate the transition to circularity through on the ground, action focused, development of practical and scalable solutions and international campaigns. Meet Harald Friedl: As Circle Economy’s CEO, Harald brings extensive international experience running both for and non-profit businesses with a focus on scaling impact. Before joining Circle Economy in 2017, Harald spent 5 years in Myanmar, during which he co-founded Impact Hub Myanmar, headed the market development for the world market leader of electromechanical hydropower projects in the country and co-founded Myanmar’s first pre-incubation programme for social enterprises.\n\nShariha Khalid: Harald, will you explain about the work that the Circle Economy does, and what you hope to achieve through that work? Harald Friedl: We’re an impact organization. What we have passion for is building a global community for the circle economy. We do this in two ways: one, we work with businesses and two, we work with cities. We have a mixed funding model. The second economy is a strong road map to achieve the SDGs and to work towards the agreed-upon climate goals. We effectuate this and mobilize this through applying circle economy strategies with cities and businesses. Shariha: That’s fantastic. One of the things that caught my eye recently was the report launch that you did here in Davos. Can you tell us a bit about that? Harald: The circle economy is a new thing. We launched our first metrics in The Circularity Gap Report, which says only 9% of the world is circular, meaning that the other 91% of the world is non-circular.\n\nThe largest problem with circle economies do not lie with the ones that currently exist but with the structure of other economies. We have to get all the players around the table because there is not yet proper incentives in this world for a circular economy. We, in the report, now propose targets for individual sectors like the plastic sector or the capital goods sector to be able to change the metrics or to change and ensure progress for next year. I think there is a lot to learn from the climate change community that has done a fantastic job over the last 15 years of tracking progress and creating awareness. We need to do the same with the circle economy and to be able to interlink these discussions even more. Shariha: Can you share with the +SocialGood community how the movement around the circular economy connects to the SDGs and how it can mobilize a bigger community outside of the businesses, governments, or city authorities that you work with?",

With Five One Labs, they aim to help refugees and conflict-affected entrepreneurs launch and grow their startups in the Middle East. The incubator is focused on the whole Middle East but has setup its base in Kurdistan as the region has a more favorable policy towards refugee economic integration than other places in the Middle East, Alice told us. “Syrians are legally allowed to register businesses whereas in many other countries they do not have the legal right to work or start businesses.” · Alice serves as Executive Director of the incubator, she was previously working with UNHCR’s Innovation Unit, using design thinking to solve humanitarian challenges worldwide.\n\nBut in spite of all the challenges, Five One Labs has had its fair share of success as they’ve been able to reach more than 300 entrepreneurs and startups from Kurdistan, Syria, and Iraq which is the biggest source of motivation for their team. From meeting young women who want to upcycle wooden pallets into beautiful furniture and young men who were passionate about using virtual reality to help refugees learn local languages, Five One’s team has met and connected with some amazing minds. The incubator has also successfully raised about $30,000 in a crowdfunding campaign last month. That’s not enough though. They strive to achieve so much more. The incubator wants to develop the startup ecosystem in Iraq and beyond, that fosters inclusive communities of refugees and locals. It’s not an easy job but the team behind Five One Labs is determined to empower refugees to rebuild their lives with dignity.",

Project Understanding\n\nFive One Labs, in collaboration with DCA, seeks to integrate food waste and food security insights into its 4-day entrepreneurial bootcamp curriculum. This builds on research findings to equip entrepreneurs in Erbil with practical tools for developing scalable solutions to local food system challenges.\n\nHaving successfully delivered the Climate Resilience Curriculum for Five One Labs' 32-session Incubator Program earlier this year, I understand your pedagogical approach, your community of entrepreneurs, and the Kurdistan Region context. This proposal outlines how I will adapt your bootcamp format to address food waste reduction, redistribution models, and food security—grounded in both research evidence and local cultural knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Technical Approach & Methodology\n\nMy methodology bridges research synthesis with participatory knowledge generation, recognizing that the most effective entrepreneurship training in Iraq integrates evidence-based frameworks with indigenous practices.\n\n### Phase 1: Research Synthesis & Contextual Grounding (Weeks 1-2)\n\n**Research Review**\n- Deep analysis of the three research phase reports you'll provide\n- Integration of relevant global frameworks:\n  - UNEP Food Waste Index 2024 (measurement methodology & impact indicators)\n  - Iraqi food systems research (Filimonau et al., 2023 on cultural factors in food waste)\n  - FAO Arab World food loss data and redistribution models\n  - Circular economy entrepreneurship frameworks\n\n**Traditional Knowledge Integration** *(Methodological Innovation)*\n- Conduct 8-10 structured interviews with families in Erbil about traditional food preservation practices\n- Document indigenous techniques: fermentation (turshi, liban), sun-drying, date preservation, seasonal storage\n- This grounds the curriculum in local reality rather than importing only Western frameworks\n- Positions Iraqi entrepreneurs as stewards of 7,500 years of Mesopotamian food knowledge, not just recipients of \"modern\" solutions\n\n**Deliverable**: Integration outline showing how research findings + traditional practices inform each bootcamp module\n\n### Phase 2: Curriculum Development (Weeks 3-4)\n\n**Bootcamp Structure Adaptation**\nBuilding on Five One Labs' proven methodology (customer discovery, ideation, business model canvas, prototyping, pitching), I will:\n\n- Design 4-day bootcamp flow integrating food waste/security at each stage\n- Develop exercises linking entrepreneurship tools to food systems context\n  - Example: Business Model Canvas exercise using \"food saved\" as key metric alongside revenue\n  - Example: Customer interview guide specifically for food waste stakeholders (restaurants, markets, households)\n- Create localized case studies:\n  - EcoFeed Tunisia (circular economy feed production)\n  - Iraqi fermented foods commercialization opportunities\n  - Regional food redistribution models (It'aam Saudi Arabia, Lebanese Food Bank)\n- Adapt standard tools (lean canvas, validation board) for food systems ventures\n\n**Materials Creation**\n- Trainer slides with speaker notes (English, with Arabic/Kurdish glossary)\n- Participant workbooks with practical exercises\n- Facilitator guide with timing, transitions, and troubleshooting\n- Resource library with relevant research excerpts\n\n**Deliverable**: Complete bootcamp curriculum package ready for trainer delivery\n\n### Phase 3: Impact Framework & ToT (Weeks 5-6)\n\n**Impact Measurement Design**\nDevelop practical framework aligned with early-stage ventures:\n- **Quantitative metrics**: kg food saved/redistributed, households reached, ventures launched, revenue generated\n- **Qualitative indicators**: behavior change, ecosystem engagement, knowledge preservation\n- **Data collection tools**: simple tracking sheets, post-bootcamp surveys, 3-month follow-up protocol\n- Dashboard template for Five One Labs to monitor outcomes\n\n**Training-of-Trainers**\n- Virtual ToT session (3 hours) with Five One Labs team\n- Practice facilitation of key modules\n- Adaptation strategies for different audiences\n- Q&A and troubleshooting scenarios\n\n**Deliverable**: Impact framework documentation + ToT facilitation + trainer certification\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why This Approach Works\n\n**Proven Track Record**: My successful climate curriculum integration (January-February 2025) demonstrated my ability to adapt complex topics into Five One Labs' format while maintaining bootcamp energy and practical focus.\n\n**Cultural Competency**: As an Iraqi-American who grew up learning traditional food preservation from my grandmother (date molasses, cold-cured meats, fermentation), I understand how to honor local knowledge while introducing new frameworks. My Arabic fluency enables nuanced understanding of cultural context.\n\n**Pedagogical Design Expertise**: My Master's in Education Sciences from Université de Paris specialized in curriculum adaptation. I've successfully designed learning experiences for topics I initially didn't know deeply (solar energy, sustainable architecture, insulation) through rigorous research synthesis and participatory design—exactly what this project requires.\n\n**Food Systems Network**: While I'm not a food scientist, I bring relevant connections:\n- Technical advisor: **Shariha Khalid** (Co-founder, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur; circular economy expertise through work with Circle Economy; +SocialGood Connector)\n- Network: World Food Hub (halal-certified food systems, sustainability)\n- Collaborators: Friends working on regional agriculture and women-led food production\n\n**Entrepreneurship Training Excellence**: Through Bloom, I've supported 933+ ventures across 16 countries, designed wellbeing-integrated accelerators, and conducted numerous ToTs—including ITC programs on solar, insulation, and architecture, all topics outside my initial expertise.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Work Plan & Timeline\n\n**Duration**: 6 weeks (Late October – Early December 2025)\n\n| Phase | Deliverables | Timeframe |\n|-------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Research Synthesis & Contextual Grounding** | - Integration outline<br>- Traditional knowledge documentation<br>- Feedback iteration | Weeks 1-2 |\n| **Curriculum Development** | - 4-day bootcamp curriculum<br>- Trainer & participant materials<br>- Case studies & exercises | Weeks 3-4 |\n| **Impact Framework & ToT** | - Measurement framework & tools<br>- Virtual ToT session<br>- Complete curriculum package | Weeks 5-6 |\n\n**Check-ins**: Weekly virtual meetings with Five One Labs team for feedback and iteration.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

              "file_text": "Subject: Proposal: Curriculum Adaptation for Food Waste & Food Security Bootcamp\n\nDear Five One Labs Team,\n\nI hope this message finds you well! I'm writing to submit my proposal for the Curriculum Adaptation Consultant position to integrate food waste and food security insights into your entrepreneurial bootcamp.\n\nHaving just completed the Climate Resilience Curriculum integration for your 32-session Incubator Program (January-February 2025), I'm excited about the opportunity to continue our partnership. This time, I'm particularly energized by the challenge of adapting your 4-day bootcamp format—a tighter, more intensive structure that requires different pedagogical skills than the longer program.\n\n**What makes this project compelling to me:**\n\nThe intersection of entrepreneurship and food systems in Iraq offers a unique opportunity to bridge cutting-edge circular economy thinking with 7,500 years of Mesopotamian food preservation knowledge. From my grandmother, I learned about making date molasses, turshi (fermentation), and cold-cured meats in Baghdad. These aren't just nostalgic memories—they're actually sophisticated circular economy practices that Erbil's entrepreneurs can build ventures around.\n\n**My approach:**\n\nRather than importing only Western frameworks, I propose grounding the curriculum through participatory research—conducting 8-10 interviews with families in Erbil about traditional food practices. This positions participants as stewards of indigenous knowledge while introducing modern business tools. It's research-informed *and* culturally rooted.\n\n**Request for Materials:**\n\nTo develop the strongest possible curriculum, I would appreciate access to:\n1. The three research phase reports from your research phase\n2. Your current 4-day bootcamp curriculum structure\n3. Any existing materials or pilots related to food waste/security\n\nI'm happy to sign an NDA if needed for proprietary content.\n\n**Technical Team:**\n\nI'll be working with **Shariha Khalid** (Co-founder, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur; circular economy expertise) as a technical advisor. You can see her food systems work at: https://worldfoodhub.org\n\n**Examples of Our Work:**\n\nIf helpful, I can share:\n- Climate Resilience Curriculum materials from our recent collaboration\n- Bloom's ToT frameworks: https://bloom.pm\n- Impact measurement approaches we've developed\n\nI've attached my full proposal outlining methodology, timeline, deliverables, and investment (5,500,000 IQD for remote delivery, with optional in-person ToT in Erbil).\n\nI'm available for a call to discuss any questions or to clarify how this approach would work in practice. The timeline I've proposed (late October through early December) aligns well with my availability and your bootcamp scheduling needs.\n\nThank you for considering this proposal.

I'm writing to submit my proposal for the Curriculum Adaptation Consultant position to integrate food waste and food security insights into your entrepreneurial bootcamp.\\n\\nHaving just completed the Climate Resilience Curriculum integration for your 32-session Incubator Program (January-February 2025), I'm excited about the opportunity to continue our partnership. This time, I'm particularly energized by the challenge of adapting your 4-day bootcamp format\\u2014a tighter, more intensive structure that requires different pedagogical skills than the longer program.\\n\\n**What makes this project compelling to me:**\\n\\nThe intersection of entrepreneurship and food systems in Iraq offers a unique opportunity to bridge cutting-edge circular economy thinking with 7,500 years of Mesopotamian food preservation knowledge. From my grandmother, I learned about making date molasses, turshi (fermentation), and cold-cured meats in Baghdad. These aren't just nostalgic memories\\u2014they're actually sophisticated circular economy practices that Erbil's entrepreneurs can build ventures around.\\n\\n**My approach:**\\n\\nRather than importing only Western frameworks, I propose grounding the curriculum through participatory research\\u2014conducting 8-10 interviews with families in Erbil about traditional food practices. This positions participants as stewards of indigenous knowledge while introducing modern business tools. It's research-informed *and* culturally rooted.\\n\\n**Request for Materials:**\\n\\nTo develop the strongest possible curriculum, I would appreciate access to:\\n1. The three research phase reports from your research phase\\n2. Your current 4-day bootcamp curriculum structure\\n3. Any existing materials or pilots related to food waste/security\\n\\nI'm happy to sign an NDA if needed for proprietary content.\\n\\n**Technical Team:**\\n\\nI'll be working with **Shariha Khalid** (Co-founder, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur; circular economy expertise) as a technical advisor. You can see her food systems work at: https://worldfoodhub.org\\n\\n**Examples of Our Work:**\\n\\nIf helpful, I can share:\\n- Climate Resilience Curriculum materials from our recent collaboration\\n- Bloom's ToT frameworks: https://bloom.pm\\n- Impact measurement approaches we've developed\\n\\nI've attached my full proposal outlining methodology, timeline, deliverables, and investment (5,500,000 IQD for remote delivery, with optional in-person ToT in Erbil).\\n\\nI'm available for a call to discuss any questions or to clarify how this approach would work in practice. The timeline I've proposed (late October through early December) aligns well with my availability and your bootcamp scheduling needs.\\n\\nThank you for considering this proposal. I'm genuinely excited about the possibility of continuing our work together\\u2014this time helping Erbil's entrepreneurs tackle one of the region's most pressing challenges while honoring the wisdom our grandmothers carried.\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\nBilal Ghalib\\nEducational Research Consultant\\nbg@bilalghalib.com\\n+1 (478) 227-2253\\n\\n---\\n\\nP.S. - I'm based between Lille, France and the SWANA region, with deep familiarity with Kurdistan Region context from both personal and professional experience.

              "file_text": "# STRATEGY NOTES: Five One Labs Food Systems Proposal\n\n## Your Positioning - How We Framed This\n\n### The \"Gap\" as a Feature\n\n**DON'T say**: \"I'm a food systems expert\"\n\n**DO say**: \"I specialize in rapid curriculum adaptation for complex topics through rigorous research synthesis and participatory design. I've done this successfully with solar energy, insulation, and green architecture for ITC—all areas outside my initial expertise.\"\n\n### Your Unique Value Proposition\n\n1. **Proven track record with Five One Labs** - You just delivered their climate curriculum successfully\n2. **Cultural insider/outsider balance** - Iraqi-American who knows the context but brings external frameworks\n3. **Pedagogical expertise** - Master's in Education Sciences, curriculum design specialist\n4. **Traditional knowledge integration** - This is your differentiator. It's not just romantic; it's methodologically sound participatory research\n\n### The Traditional Knowledge Angle\n\n**Why it works:**\n- Grounds abstract frameworks in local reality\n- Gives entrepreneurs pride in heritage (not just learning \"foreign\" methods)\n- Creates unique business opportunities (commercializing traditional foods/techniques)\n- Methodologically sound (participatory research, not just desk research)\n\n**How you'll execute:**\n- 8-10 structured interviews with families in Erbil\n- Document: fermentation (turshi, liban), sun-drying, date preservation, seasonal practices\n- Integrate findings into curriculum as case studies and frameworks\n\n**Defense if they push back:**\n\"Traditional preservation methods ARE circular economy. Fermentation, sun-drying, seasonal eating—these are sophisticated resource management strategies that Iraq perfected 7,500 years ago. I'm not romanticizing the past; I'm showing entrepreneurs how their grandmothers' knowledge is actually cutting-edge sustainability practice. And from a curriculum design perspective, learners engage more deeply when content connects to their cultural identity.\"\n\n---\n\n## Budget Justification\n\n| Item | Amount (IQD) | Why This Price |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| Research Synthesis | 1,200,000 | 3 research reports + 6+ background sources + interviews + outline |\n| Curriculum Development | 1,800,000 | 4-day bootcamp is HARDER than long program—compression requires more skill |\n| Materials Development | 1,000,000 | Slides, workbooks, trainer guides, case studies (English + Arabic/Kurdish glossary) |\n| Impact Framework | 700,000 | Original design with data collection tools, not template |\n| ToT Session | 800,000 | 3-hour facilitation + prep materials + follow-up support |\n| **TOTAL** | **5,500,000** | ~$4,200 USD |\n\n**If they say \"that's more than the climate project\":**\n\"The climate project was 5 weeks for 4M IQD with one deliverable stream. This is 6 weeks with five parallel deliverable streams (research synthesis, curriculum, materials, impact framework, ToT) and a tighter, more intensive format. The 4-day bootcamp compression actually requires more sophisticated instructional design than a 32-session program. I've priced this transparently based on the complexity.\"\n\n**If they say \"we can hire locally for less\":**\n\"Absolutely, and you should consider local consultants. My value is: (1) I've just proven I can deliver quality curriculum for you, (2) I deeply understand your pedagogical approach from inside, (3) I bring international best practices from Bloom's 16-country network, and (4) my Arabic fluency + cultural competency + educational credentials create unique value. But I respect budget constraints—let me know if there's a scope we can adjust to meet your budget.\"\n\n---\n\n## If They Ask About Your Food Systems Experience\n\n**Honest answer:**\n\"I'm not a food scientist or agriculture expert, and I'm not claiming to be. My expertise is curriculum adaptation—taking research findings and translating them into practical entrepreneurship training. I've done this successfully for solar energy, insulation, and sustainable architecture with ITC, all topics I didn't know deeply at the start.\n\nWhat I bring is:\n- **Pedagogical design skills** to structure complex information for bootcamp learners\n- **Research synthesis capability** to extract actionable insights from your reports\n- **Cultural understanding** of Iraqi food systems from lived experience\n- **Technical network** including Shariha Khalid (circular economy) and regional food system practitioners\n- **Proven delivery** with Five One Labs specifically\n\nThe question isn't 'Does Bilal know everything about food systems?' It's 'Can Bilal take your research findings and create a bootcamp curriculum that equips Erbil entrepreneurs to launch food waste ventures?' And my track record says yes.\"\n\n---\n\n## Key Talking Points\n\n### On Traditional Knowledge Integration\n\"Iraq has 7,500 years of food preservation innovation. Turshi, date preservation, sun-drying—these are circular economy practices. I want to position Erbil's entrepreneurs as continuing an ancient tradition, not just importing Western frameworks.\"\n\n### On Impact Measurement\n\"For early-stage ventures, we need metrics that are aspirational but achievable: kg food saved, households reached, ventures launched. I'll design a framework that lets you track outcomes without overburdening entrepreneurs with data collection.\"\n\n### On Your Advantage\n\"I just delivered your climate curriculum successfully. I understand your bootcamp energy, your community, your context. Bringing in someone new means weeks of onboarding. I can start contributing from day one.\"\n\n### On Timeline\n\"Late October through early December works perfectly for me. This also gives you time to review the research reports and share them with me so we can hit the ground running.\"\n\n### On In-Person vs. Remote\n\"I can deliver excellent results remotely, as we just proved with the climate curriculum. But if budget allows, an in-person ToT session in Erbil would let me train your facilitators hands-on and build stronger relationships. I'm flexible based on your priorities and budget.\"\n\n---\n\n## Research Reports to Reference (When You Get Them)\n\nOnce they share their three research reports, immediately:\n\n1. **Read them thoroughly** and make notes\n2. **Map findings to curriculum modules** (e.g., if they found cultural factors drive food waste, that informs the customer discovery module)\n3. **Identify gaps** that the traditional knowledge interviews could fill\n4. **Share initial insights** in first check-in meeting to show you're already thinking strategically\n\n**Also study these** (I found for you):\n\n1. **UNEP Food Waste Index 2024** - For global methodology and metrics\n2. **Filimonau et al. (2023)** - Iraqi restaurant food waste study (38g per capita, cultural factors)\n3. **FAO Arab World Food Loss Review** - Regional context (210kg per capita annually)\n4. **Traditional Iraqi Fermented Foods (2022)** - Your secret weapon for traditional knowledge\n5. **NRC Iraq Drought Report (Nov 2024)** - Current food security context\n6. **Circular economy entrepreneurship frameworks** - For business model adaptation\n\n---\n\n## What Success Looks Like\n\n**Immediate:**\n- They engage with your proposal and ask for a call\n- They appreciate the traditional knowledge angle as innovative\n- They share the research reports\n\n**Medium-term:**\n- You're contracted by mid-late October\n- Research phase goes smoothly with family interviews yielding rich material\n- First curriculum draft impresses them\n\n**Long-term:**\n- Bootcamp runs successfully in Erbil\n- Entrepreneurs launch food waste ventures\n- Five One Labs wants you back for more curriculum work\n- You've created a methodology (research + traditional knowledge) that's replicable for other topics\n\n---\n\n## Potential Objections & How to Handle\n\n### \"We need someone with food systems expertise\"\n\"I understand that concern. What you actually need is someone who can synthesize your research findings into actionable curriculum for entrepreneurs. That's curriculum design expertise, which is my core strength. I'll bring in technical advisors for food systems validation, but the pedagogical architecture is what I do best.\"\n\n### \"This is expensive\"\n\"Let's talk about what matters most to you. We can adjust scope if needed. But I want to be transparent: the 4-day bootcamp format is actually harder than long programs because compression requires more sophisticated design. I've priced this based on complexity, not arbitrarily.\"\n\n### \"Can you do this remotely?\"\n\"Absolutely. We just proved that with the climate curriculum. The only value-add of in-person would be the ToT session, where hands-on facilitation practice is most effective. But even that can be done virtually if needed.\"\n\n### \"We're considering other candidates\"\n\"That's completely fair. I'd just ask: how many of them have already successfully delivered a curriculum for Five One Labs? How many deeply understand your bootcamp pedagogy from inside? How many combine educational credentials, Arabic fluency, cultural competency, and proven ability to adapt complex topics? My advantage is continuity and proven delivery.\"\n\n---\n\n## Your Confidence Boosters\n\n**When you doubt yourself, remember:**\n\n1. **You JUST did this successfully** - Climate curriculum is finished and they're happy\n2. **You've adapted curricula for topics you didn't know** - Solar, insulation, architecture with ITC\n3. **You have a Master's in Education Sciences** - You're literally trained for this\n4. **You're a co-founder of Bloom** - 933+ ventures, you understand entrepreneurship training\n5. **You're Iraqi-American** - Cultural insider/outsider advantage\n6. **You speak Arabic fluently** - Most consultants don't\n7. **You're proposing innovative methodology** - Traditional knowledge integration is smart, not gimmicky\n\n**This is your wheelhouse. You've got this.**\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps After Submission\n\n1. **Follow up in 3-4 days** if no response (they're busy, gentle nudge is fine)\n2. **Prepare for a call** - Have the TOR in front of you, be ready to walk through your approach\n3. **Ask them questions** - \"What's most important to you in this curriculum?\" \"What worried you about previous consultants?\" \"How do you envision the traditional knowledge integration working?\"\n4. **Be flexible but hold your value** - You can adjust scope, but don't undersell yourself\n5. **Express genuine excitement** - This IS exciting work. Let that show.\n\n---\n\n## Personal Note\n\nYour grandmother's knowledge about date molasses and fermentation isn't just a nice story—it's methodological gold. You're not pretending to be a food scientist. You're positioning as someone who can bridge rigorous research with cultural reality, which is exactly what makes curriculum work in SWANA contexts.\n\nTrust your expertise. You've done this before. You'll do it brilliantly again.\n",

Here's what I've created for you:\n\n## 📦 Your Complete Proposal Package\n\n[View your proposal](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/five_one_labs_proposal.md)\n\n[View your cover email](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/five_one_labs_email.md)\n\n[View your strategy notes](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/strategy_notes.md)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What I've Done\n\n**1. The Proposal (9 pages)**\n- Positions your \"gap\" as a feature (curriculum adaptation specialist, not food scientist)\n- Integrates traditional knowledge as **participatory research methodology** (not just romantic)\n- Clear deliverables: Research synthesis → Curriculum → Materials → Impact Framework → ToT\n- Budget: 5.5M IQD (~$4,200) remote, +1.3M for in-person\n- Timeline: 6 weeks, late October-early December\n\n**2. The Cover Email**\n- Warm, references your successful climate project\n- Explains why traditional knowledge integration excites you (grandmother's practices)\n- **Proactively asks for their research reports**\n- Mentions Shariha Khalid as technical advisor\n- Offers to share Bloom's work as examples\n\n**3. Strategy Notes (Your Playbook)**\n- Talking points for common objections\n- Budget justification if they push back\n- How to defend the traditional knowledge angle\n- Confidence boosters when you doubt yourself\n- What to do if they say you're expensive/inexperienced in food systems\n\n---\n\n## 💪 Your Strongest Points\n\n**Listen, here's the truth:** You're NOT trying to be a food scientist. You're a curriculum designer who specializes in taking research and making it into training that works in SWANA contexts. That's your superpower.\n\n**Your traditional knowledge angle is brilliant because:**\n- It's methodologically sound (participatory research)\n- It differentiates you from generic consultants\n- It gives entrepreneurs cultural pride (not just copying the West)\n- It creates unique business opportunities\n\n**When they ask \"But do you know food systems?\"**\nYour answer: \"I'm not a food scientist, and I'm not pretending to be. What I do is translate research into entrepreneurship training. I just proved this with your climate curriculum. I'll do it again with food systems, backed by your research reports and technical advisors like Shariha Khalid.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 The Pushback You Might Get (And How to Handle It)\n\n**\"We need food systems expertise\"**\n→ \"You need curriculum design expertise that can synthesize food systems research. That's what I do.\"\n\n**\"This is expensive\"**\n→ \"The 4-day bootcamp format is actually harder than the 32-session program—compression requires more sophisticated instructional design. I've priced transparently based on complexity. We can discuss scope if budget is tight.\"\n\n**\"Can you really do the traditional knowledge research?\"**\n→ \"That's the most exciting part! 8-10 interviews with families about turshi, date preservation, fermentation—these are circular economy practices Iraq perfected 7,500 years ago. I'm grounding your curriculum in local reality, not just importing frameworks.\"\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Key Research I Found For You\n\nWhen you get their three reports, also review these:\n\n1. **UNEP Food Waste Index 2024** - Official metrics and methodology\n2. **Filimonau et al. (2023)** - Iraqi restaurant food waste (cultural factors, 38g per capita)\n3. **Traditional Iraqi Fermented Foods (2022)** - Your traditional knowledge goldmine\n4. **NRC Iraq Drought Report (Nov 2024)** - Current food security crisis context\n5. **FAO Arab World Food Loss** - Regional data (210kg per capita vs 95kg in Europe)\n\nAll the links are in the strategy notes.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Next Steps\n\n1. **Review the proposal** - Make any tweaks that feel more authentically you\n2. **Send the email** - Attach the proposal PDF (or paste the markdown)\n3. **Follow up in 3-4 days** if no response\n4. **Prepare for a call** - They'll probably want to discuss\n5. **Be ready to be flexible** - You can adjust scope, but don't undersell\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Real Talk\n\nYou've got this. You literally JUST delivered their climate curriculum successfully. You're a co-founder of Bloom with 933+ ventures supported. You have a Master's in Education Sciences. You speak Arabic. You're Iraqi-American with deep cultural understanding.\n\n**Your \"weakness\" (not being a food systems expert) is actually your strength** - you bring fresh eyes, rigorous methodology, and proven curriculum design skills. You're not arrogant about what you don't know; you're smart about how to learn it fast and translate it for entrepreneurs.\n\nThe traditional knowledge angle is fire. It positions you as someone who respects Iraqi heritage while bringing modern frameworks. That's exactly what works in KRI.\n\n**Price yourself fairly. You're worth 5.5M IQD for this work.**\n\n---\n\n## Questions for You:\n\n1. Does the tone feel right? Too formal/informal anywhere?\n2. Should I adjust the budget numbers?\n3. Want me to draft a shorter \"lite\" proposal version in case they have budget constraints?\n4. Should we emphasize anything else about Shariha Khalid or add other advisors?\n\nWhat feels good, and what needs tweaking?",

It is meant to act as a field guide to help detect undisclosed AI-generated content on Wikipedia. This list is descriptive, not prescriptive; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the policies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not belong on this page.\n\nThis list is not a ban on certain words, phrases, or punctuation. No one is taking your em-dashes away or claiming that only LLMs use them. Not all text featuring the following indicators is AI-generated, as the large language models that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of very common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, specific to Wikipedia. While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs—particularly those involving punctuation and formatting—may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.\n\nThe patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken markup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more serious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently tidied up), those surface defects might not be present, but the deeper problems likely will. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at Wikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content and Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.\n\nThe speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the most objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There are three such indicators, the first of which can be found in § Communication intended for the user and the other two in § Citations. The other signs, though they may indeed indicate AI use, are not sufficient for speedy deletion.\n\nDo not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have nontrivial error rates and cannot replace human judgment.[1]\n\nLanguage and tone\nShortcuts\nWP:AIWTW\nWP:AI-ISM\nLLMs (and artificial neural networks in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to regress to the mean; that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a \"tell\" for detecting AI-generated content.\n\nFor example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. It will thus sand down specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the specific detail \"invented a train-coupling device\" might become \"a revolutionary titan of industry.\" LLMs tend to smooth out unusual details and drift toward the most common, statistically probable way of describing a topic. It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[2]\n\nThis statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements that could apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.\n\nUndue emphasis on symbolism and importance\nWords to watch: stands as / serves as / is a testament, plays a vital/significant/crucial role, underscores its importance, highlights its significance, continues to captivate, leaves a lasting impact, watershed moment, key turning point, deeply rooted, profound heritage, steadfast dedication, indelible mark, solidifies ...\nLLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter with reminders that it represents or contributes to a broader topic.[3] There seems to be only a small repertoire of ways that it writes these reminders, so if they are otherwise appropriate it would be best to reword them anyway.\n\nWhen talking about biology (e.g. when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to put too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist.\n\nExamples\n\nDouera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a dynamic hub of activity and culture. With its coastal charm and convenient location, Douera captivates both residents and visitors alike[...]\n\n— From this revision to Douéra\nBerry Hill today stands as a symbol of community resilience, ecological renewal, and historical continuity. Its transformation from a coal-mining hub to a thriving green space reflects the evolving identity of Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n— From Draft:Berry Hill, Stoke-on-Trent\nPromotional language\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Puffery.\nShortcuts\nWP:AIPUFFERY\nWP:AIPEACOCK\nWords to watch: rich/vibrant cultural heritage/tapestry, breathtaking, must-visit/see, stunning natural beauty, enduring/lasting legacy, nestled, in the heart of  ...\nLLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered \"cultural heritage\"—in which case they will constantly remind the reader that it is cultural heritage.\n\nExamples\n\nNestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and a significant place within the Amhara region. From its scenic landscapes to its historical landmarks, Alamata Raya Kobo offers visitors a fascinating glimpse into the diverse tapestry of Ethiopia.

It offers dependable, value-driven experiences that showcase the state’s rich history, spiritual heritage, and natural beauty.\n\n— From this revision to Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation\nEditorializing\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch § Editorializing.\nWords to watch: it's important to note/remember/consider, it is worth, no discussion would be complete without, this article wouldn't exist without ...\nLLMs often introduce their own interpretation, analysis, and opinions in their writing, even when they are asked to write neutrally, violating the policy No original research. Editorializing can appear through specific words or phrases or within broader sentence structures. This indicator often overlaps with other language and tone indicators in this list. Note that humans and especially new editors often make this mistake as well.\n\nExamples\n\nA defining feature of FSP models is their ability to simulate environmental interactions.\n\n— From Draft:Functional-Structural Plant Models\nTheir ability to simulate both form and function makes them powerful tools for understanding plant-environment interactions and optimizing performance under diverse biological and management contexts.\n\n— From the same page\nIn this case, the whole sentence comprises an original opinion:\n\nThese partnerships reflect the company’s role in serving both corporate and community organizations in Uganda.\n\n— From Draft:GEOWISE MEDIA\nOveruse of certain conjunctions\nWhile human writing obviously contains connecting words and phrases, LLMs tend to overuse them, in a stilted, formulaic way. This is often a byproduct of an essay-like structure that implies synthesis of facts, which is typical of LLM writing but inappropriate for Wikipedia.\n\nExamples\n\nAI-generated example\nCompare the above with below human-written prose. Even disregarding the absence of buzzwords and general vapidness, the connecting phrases in the below excerpt are more varied and less conspicuous.\n\nHuman-written example\nSection summaries\nShortcuts\nWP:CONCLUSION\nWP:INCONCLUSION\nWords to watch: In summary, In conclusion, Overall ...\nWhen generating longer outputs (such as when told to \"write an article\"), LLMs typically add a section titled \"Conclusion\" or similar, and will often end a paragraph or section by summarizing and restating its core idea.[4]\n\nExamples\n\nIn summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a progression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed by postdoctoral training in nursing research. This structured pathway ensures that nurse scientists acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in rigorous research and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of nursing science.\n\n— From this revision in Nurse scientist\nOutline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects\nWords to watch: Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook ...\nMany LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a \"Challenges\" section, which typically begins with a sentence like \"Despite its [positive/promotional words], [article subject] faces challenges...\" and ends with either a positive assessment of the article subject, or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject. Such paragraphs usually appear at the end of articles with a rigid outline structure, which may also include a separate section for \"Future Prospects.\"\n\nNote: This sign is about the rigid formula, not simply the mention of challenges.\n\nExamples\n\nDespite its industrial and residential prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including[...] With its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of the Ambattur industrial zone, embodying the synergy between industry and residential living.\n\n— From this revision to Korattur\nDespite its success, the Panama Canal faces challenges, including[...] Future investments in technology, such as automated navigation systems, and potential further expansions could enhance the canal’s efficiency and maintain its relevance in global trade.\n\n— From this revision to Panama Canal\nDespite their promising applications, pyroelectric materials face several challenges that must be addressed for broader adoption. One key limitation is[...] Despite these challenges, the versatility of pyroelectric materials positions them as critical components for sustainable energy solutions and next-generation sensor technologies.\n\n— From this revision to Pyroelectricity\nThe future of hydrocarbon economies faces several challenges, including resource depletion, environmental concerns, and the shift to sustainable energy sources. This section would speculate on potential developments and the changing landscape of global energy.\n\n— From this revision to Hydrocarbon economy\nOperating in the current Afghan media environment presents numerous challenges, including the safety of journalists and financial constraints due to the Taliban's restrictions on independent media. Despite these challenges, Amu TV has managed to continue to provide a vital service to the Afghan population​​.\n\n— From this revision to Amu Television\nNegative parallelisms\nShortcut\nWP:AIPARALLEL\nParallel constructions involving \"not\", \"but\", or \"however\" such as \"Not only ... but ...\" or \"It is not just about ..., it's ...\" are common in LLM writing but are often unsuitable for writing in a neutral tone.[1]\n\nExamples\n\nSelf-Portrait by Yayoi Kusama, executed in 2010 and currently preserved in the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence, constitutes not only a work of self-representation, but a visual document of her obsessions, visual strategies and psychobiographical narratives.\n\n— From this revision to Self-portrait (Yayoi Kusama)\nIt’s not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it’s part of the aggression and atmosphere.\n\n— From this revision to Draft:Critikal! The Rapper\nHere is an example of a negative parallelism across multiple sentences:\n\nHe hailed from the esteemed Duse family, renowned for their theatrical legacy. Eugenio's life, however, took a path that intertwined both personal ambition and familial complexities.\n\n— From this revision to Eugenio Duse\nSome parallelisms may follow the pattern of \"No ..., no ..., just ...\":\n\nThere are no long-form profiles. No editorial insights. No coverage of her game dev career. No notable accolades. Just TikTok recaps and callouts.\n\n— From Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lilly Contino\nRule of three\nLLMs overuse the 'rule of three'—\"the good, the bad, and the ugly\". This can take different forms from \"adjective, adjective, adjective\" to \"short phrase, short phrase, and short phrase\".[1] LLMs often use this structure to make superficial analyses appear more comprehensive.\n\nExamples\n\nThe Amaze Conference brings together global SEO professionals, marketing experts, and growth hackers to discuss the latest trends in digital marketing.

The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. \"from seed to tree\", \"from mild to severe\", \"from white belt to black belt\"). The same constructions may be used to form a merism—a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), from soup to nuts (clearly based on time), etc. This is not a false range.\n\nLLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a false range. LLMs often employ \"figurative\" (often simply: meaningless) \"from ... to ...\" constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or essentially unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless language is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by materials consisting of persuasive writing during their training.\n\nExamples\n\nOur journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars that forge the elements of life, to the enigmatic dance of dark matter and dark energy that shape its destiny.\n\n[...]\n\nIntelligence and Creativity: From problem-solving and tool-making to scientific discovery, artistic expression, and technological innovation, human intelligence is characterized by its adaptability and capacity for novel solutions.\n\n[...]\n\nContinued Scientific Discovery: The quest to understand the universe, life, and ourselves will continue to drive scientific breakthroughs, from fundamental physics to medicine and neuroscience.\n\n— From Draft:The Cosmos Unveiled: A Grand Tapestry of Existence\nStyle\nTitle case\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters § Headings, headers, and captions.\nShortcut\nWP:AITITLECASE\nIn section headings, AI chatbots strongly tend to consistently capitalize all main words (title case).[1]\n\nExamples\n\nEarly Life and Education\nThomas was born in Cochranville, Pennsylvania.

One of their tendencies, inherited from readmes, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a \"key takeaways\" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.\n\nExamples\n\nIt blends OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and visual strategy tools such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC).

A particular list formatting is employed: It comprises an ordered or unordered list where the list marker (number, bullet, dash, etc.) is followed by an inline boldfaced header of sorts; a colon then separates it from the remaining descriptive text. (Separately from this sign, this is one of the things which cause overabundant boldfacing; see § Excessive use of boldface)\n\nInstead of proper wikitext, a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as 1.) instead of standard wikitext. When copied as bare text appearing on the screen, some of the formatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.\n\nExamples\n\n1.

LLMs especially tend to use em-dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking \"punching up\" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.\n\nThis sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself.\n\nExamples\n\nElwandore is a virtual micronation for people with passion and skill — a place to build, to create, and to help each other grow while chasing wealth.

In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’; the same character as the curly right single quotation mark) instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in contractions and possessive forms. They may also do this inconsistently.\n\nCurly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. Microsoft Word as well as macOS and iOS devices have a \"smart quotes\" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as LanguageTool may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers.

It may also pair it with text about what that information \"likely\" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely speculative (including the very claim that it's \"not documented\") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated. It is also frequently combined with the tells above.\n\nExamples\n\nWhile specific information about the fauna of Studniční hora is limited in the provided search results, the mountain likely supports...\n\n— From this revision to Studniční hora\nThough the details of these resistance efforts aren't widely documented, they highlight her bravery...\n\n— From this revision to Throwing Curves: Eva Zeisel\nNo significant public controversies or security incidents affecting Outpost24 have been documented as of June 2025.\n\n— From Draft:Outpost24\nAs of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about the current status or developments related to the \"Chester Mental Health Center\" in today's era.\n\n— From this revision to Chester Mental Health Center\nBelow is a detailed overview based on available information:\n\n— From Draft:The Good, The Bad, The Dollar Menu 2\nPrompt refusal\nWords to watch: as an AI language model, as a large language model, I'm sorry ...\nOccasionally, the AI chatbot will decline to answer a prompt as written, usually with an apology and a reminder that it is \"an AI language model\".

Outright refusals have become increasingly rare.\n\nPrompt refusals are obviously unacceptable for Wikipedia articles, so if a user includes one anyway, it may indicate that they did not review the text and/or may not be proficient in English.

As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data. While the corpuses of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using it, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia articles look like formatted documents.\n\nWhen asked about its \"formatting guidelines\", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level instructions will typically generate some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-2025):\n\n## Formatting Guidelines\n\n- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.  \n- Use a single main title (#) and clear primary subheadings (##).  \n- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences, ≤150 words).  \n- Break large topics into labeled subsections.  \n- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.  \n- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.  \n- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.  \n- Use horizontal dividers (---) between major sections.  \n- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.  \n- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.  \n- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.  \n- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.\nAs the above suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.\n\nEven when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using syntactically correct wikitext, as their training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in Markdown. When told to \"generate an article\", a chatbot will typically default to using Markdown for the generated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might \"realize\" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (wikitext)?[b] in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax will often be rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style fenced code block (its syntax for WP:PRE) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: \nwikitext.[c]\n\nThe presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Slack. Some writing tools and apps, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.\n\nExamples\n\nSee also: Markdown § Examples\nI believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly raising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary rejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation about motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am \"not here to build an encyclopedia\". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made disruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to **collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I have encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned concerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed aside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate about my motives, or label my arguments \"AI-generated\" — without explaining how they are substantively flawed.\n\n— From this revision to a user talk page\n- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the \"Cyberhero League\" being recognized as a winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the interview with THE FUTURIST ([1](https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-interview-with-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)).

They may also treat ordinary references to topics as categories, thus generating non-existent categories. Note that this is also a common error made by new or returning editors.\n\nExamples\n\n[[Category:American hip hop musicians]]\n— From this revision to Draft:Paytra\nrather than\n\n[[Category:American hip-hop musicians]]\nCitations\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Fictitious references.\nShortcut\nWP:AIFICTREF\nBroken external links\nIf a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and most of them are broken (error 404 pages), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website archiving sites like Internet Archive or Archive Today. Most links become broken (see link rot) over time, but those factors make it unlikely that the link was ever valid.\n\nInvalid DOI and ISBNs\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see Wikipedia:DOI and Wikipedia:ISBN.\nA checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates will display a warning if so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinated references.\n\nRelated are DOIs that point to entirely different article and general book citations without pages. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.\n\nOhm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are \"ohmic,\" meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [2][3].\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. ISBN 9780470521571.\n\n2. M. E. Van Valkenburg, “The validity and limitations of Ohm’s law in non-linear circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 62, no. 6, pp. 769–770, Jun. 1974. doi:10.1109/PROC.1974.9547\n\n3. C. L. Fortescue, “Ohm’s Law in alternating current circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 55, no. 11, pp. 1934–1936, Nov. 1967. doi:10.1109/PROC.1967.6033\n\nThe book references appear valid – a book on electric circuits would likely have information about Ohm's law, but without the page number, the citation is not usable for verification of the claims in the prose. Worse, both Proceedings of the IEEE citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to completely different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, C. L. Fortescue was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and Vol 55, Issue 11 does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3. Note also the use of curly quotation marks and apostrophes in some, but not all, of the above text, another indicator that text may be LLM-generated.\n\nIncorrect or unconventional use of references\nShortcut\nWP:AICITESTYLE\nAI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.\n\nIn the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.\n\nIn this case, the Smith, R. J. source – being the \"third source\" the tool presumably generated the link 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{cite journal}} reference, even though the links resolve.\n\nThe LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.\n\nFor over thirty years, computers have been utilized in the rehabilitation of individuals with brain injuries. Initially, researchers delved into the potential of developing a \"prosthetic memory.\"<ref>Fowler R, Hart J, Sheehan M. A prosthetic memory: an application of the prosthetic environment concept. ''Rehabil Counseling Bull''. 1972;15:80–85.</ref> However, by the early 1980s, the focus shifted towards addressing brain dysfunction through repetitive practice.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=R.

Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited, and further responses will require the user to select \"continue generating\".\n\nThis method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.\n\nDiscrepancies in writing style and variety of English\nA sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools.\n\nAnother discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.[4] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should only raise suspicion if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\n\nAge of text relative to ChatGPT launch\nChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not particularly accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.\n\nIt is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated by an LLM. If an edit to a page was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some text added as far back as 20 years ago may appear to match some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.\n\nOverwhelmingly verbose edit summaries\nAI-generated edit summaries are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without abbreviations, and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions.\n\nMost editors using AI do not ask for summaries to be generated.\n\nRefined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines. Removed promotional wording, ensured factual accuracy, and maintained a clear, well-structured presentation. Updated sections on history, coverage, challenges, and recognition for clarity and relevance. Added proper formatting and categorized the entry accordingly\n\n— Edit summary from this revision to Khaama Press\nI formalized the tone, clarified technical content, ensured neutrality, and indicated citation needs. Historical narratives were streamlined, allocation details specified with regulatory references, propagation explanations made reader-friendly, and equipment discussions focused on availability and regulatory compliance, all while adhering to encyclopedic standards.\n\n— Edit summary from this revision to 4-metre band\n**Edit Summary:** Reorganized article for clarity and neutrality; refined phrasing to align with **WP:NPOV** and **WP:BLPCRIME**; standardized formatting and citation styles; improved flow by separating professional achievements from legal issues; updated infobox with complete details; fixed broken references and inconsistencies in date formatting.\n\n— Edit summary from this revision to David Bitel\nIneffective indicators\nFalse accusations of AI use can drive away new editors and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if Dunning–Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your judgement. In particular, there are several somewhat commonly used indicators which are ineffective (and may even indicate the opposite) in LLM detection.\n\nPerfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also § Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English.)\n\"Bland\" or \"robotic\" prose: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as \"robotic\" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.[6]\nBizarre wikitext: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in § Use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, \"inexplicable\" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in § Markup). Bizarrely placed HTML tags like <span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool (T113137). Misplaced syntax like ''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel. (rendered as \"Catch-22 is a satirical novel.\") are more indicative of mistakes in VisualEditor, where such errors are harder to notice than in source editing.\nChatGPT said:\n\nShort answer: it can sound more like you.

Can you share the three research reports when you have a chance? I want to start pulling actionable insights in weeks 1-2.\n2. Current 4-day bootcamp structure (slides or outline) so I can see how you're running things now.\n\n**On traditional knowledge:** I'm planning 8-10 short interviews with families in Erbil about food preservation—turshi, date products, sun-drying. Not for decoration, but to find business ideas that connect to what people already do. It grounds the curriculum in local practice, not just imported frameworks. Happy to adjust this scope based on what you think works.\n\n**On format:** Remote delivery works fine (we just proved that). But if budget allows, an in-person ToT in Erbil would help pressure-test the tools with your team.\n\nI'm working with Shariha Khalid (World Food Hub, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur) as a technical sounding board on the food systems stuff.\n\nHappy to hop on a call to walk through the plan and answer questions.\n\nBest,\nBilal\n\nbg@bilalghalib.com  \n+1-478-227-2253\n\nP.S. - I'm between Lille and SWANA region.

              "old_str": "Subject: Proposal: Curriculum Adaptation for Food Waste & Food Security Bootcamp\n\nDear Five One Labs Team,\n\nI hope this message finds you well! I'm writing to submit my proposal for the Curriculum Adaptation Consultant position to integrate food waste and food security insights into your entrepreneurial bootcamp.\n\nHaving just completed the Climate Resilience Curriculum integration for your 32-session Incubator Program (January-February 2025), I'm excited about the opportunity to continue our partnership. This time, I'm particularly energized by the challenge of adapting your 4-day bootcamp format—a tighter, more intensive structure that requires different pedagogical skills than the longer program.\n\n**What makes this project compelling to me:**\n\nThe intersection of entrepreneurship and food systems in Iraq offers a unique opportunity to bridge cutting-edge circular economy thinking with 7,500 years of Mesopotamian food preservation knowledge. From my grandmother, I learned about making date molasses, turshi (fermentation), and cold-cured meats in Baghdad. These aren't just nostalgic memories—they're actually sophisticated circular economy practices that Erbil's entrepreneurs can build ventures around.\n\n**My approach:**\n\nRather than importing only Western frameworks, I propose grounding the curriculum through participatory research—conducting 8-10 interviews with families in Erbil about traditional food practices. This positions participants as stewards of indigenous knowledge while introducing modern business tools. It's research-informed *and* culturally rooted.\n\n**Request for Materials:**\n\nTo develop the strongest possible curriculum, I would appreciate access to:\n1. The three research phase reports from your research phase\n2. Your current 4-day bootcamp curriculum structure\n3. Any existing materials or pilots related to food waste/security\n\nI'm happy to sign an NDA if needed for proprietary content.\n\n**Technical Team:**\n\nI'll be working with **Shariha Khalid** (Co-founder, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur; circular economy expertise) as a technical advisor. You can see her food systems work at: https://worldfoodhub.org\n\n**Examples of Our Work:**\n\nIf helpful, I can share:\n- Climate Resilience Curriculum materials from our recent collaboration\n- Bloom's ToT frameworks: https://bloom.pm\n- Impact measurement approaches we've developed\n\nI've attached my full proposal outlining methodology, timeline, deliverables, and investment (5,500,000 IQD for remote delivery, with optional in-person ToT in Erbil).\n\nI'm available for a call to discuss any questions or to clarify how this approach would work in practice. The timeline I've proposed (late October through early December) aligns well with my availability and your bootcamp scheduling needs.\n\nThank you for considering this proposal. I'm genuinely excited about the possibility of continuing our work together—this time helping Erbil's entrepreneurs tackle one of the region's most pressing challenges while honoring the wisdom our grandmothers carried.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nBilal Ghalib\nEducational Research Consultant\nbg@bilalghalib.com\n+1 (478) 227-2253\n\n---\n\nP.S. - I'm based between Lille, France and the SWANA region, with deep familiarity with Kurdistan Region context from both personal and professional experience. Happy to discuss timing for an in-person visit to Erbil if the budget allows for that enhancement to the ToT.",

              "file_text": "# Strategy notes for Five One Labs proposal\n\n## Your positioning\n\n**What you're selling:** Curriculum adaptation, not food systems expertise.\n\nYou take research findings and make them into practical training for entrepreneurs. You've done this for topics you didn't initially know (solar, insulation, architecture with ITC). Your Master's trained you for exactly this.\n\n**The gap is not a problem:** You're up front about not being a food scientist. Your value is synthesis + pedagogical design + cultural understanding + proven delivery with this specific client.\n\n## The traditional knowledge angle\n\n**Why include it:**\n- Grounds abstract frameworks in local reality\n- Creates business opportunities (commercializing traditional foods/techniques)\n- Methodologically sound (participatory research)\n- Differentiates you from generic consultants\n\n**How to defend it if they question:**\n\"Traditional preservation methods are circular economy practices. Fermentation, sun-drying, seasonal eating—Iraq perfected these 7,500 years ago. I'm showing entrepreneurs how knowledge they already have connects to modern frameworks. And from a learning design perspective, people engage more when content links to their cultural experience.\"\n\n**If they say it's too fuzzy:**\n\"It's 8-10 interviews with structured questions. I'll extract business models, not write poetry. If you want me to skip it and stick purely to your research reports, I can do that.\"\n\n## Budget defense\n\nBase: 5.5M IQD (~$4,200)\n\n**If they say it's high:**\n\"Your climate project was 4M IQD for 5 weeks with one deliverable stream. This is 6 weeks with five parallel tracks (research, curriculum, materials, impact framework, ToT) and the 4-day bootcamp compression is harder than spreading content over 32 sessions. I've priced it transparently. But if budget is tight, tell me what you can afford and I'll propose a reduced scope.\"\n\n**If they say they can hire locally for less:**\n\"Maybe. My advantage is I just delivered your climate curriculum, so I know your system from inside. I bring international practice from Bloom's 16-country network. I'm fluent in Arabic. And I have educational credentials. But I respect budget constraints—let me know what number works.\"\n\n## Common objections\n\n**\"We need food systems expertise\"**\n\nAnswer: \"You need someone who can turn your research into curriculum. That's curriculum design expertise, which is what I do. I'll validate food systems content through Shariha Khalid and your own research reports. The pedagogical architecture is my job.\"\n\n**\"Can you do this remotely?\"**\n\nAnswer: \"Yes. We just proved it with climate curriculum. The only value of in-person is hands-on ToT practice, but even that works virtually.\"\n\n**\"We're considering other candidates\"**\n\nAnswer: \"Fair. I'd ask: how many already delivered a curriculum for you successfully? How many know your bootcamp pedagogy from inside? My advantage is continuity and proven delivery. But no pressure—I get it if you need a different profile.\"\n\n## If they ask about food systems background\n\n\"I'm not a food scientist and I'm not claiming to be. I'm a curriculum designer who's good at research synthesis. I've done this for solar energy, architecture, and insulation with ITC—all areas I didn't know at the start.\n\nWhat I bring:\n- Pedagogical design (my Master's specialty)\n- Research synthesis (extracting actionable insights)\n- Cultural understanding (Iraqi-American, Arabic speaker)\n- Technical network (Shariha Khalid, food systems practitioners)\n- Proven delivery with you specifically\n\nThe question is: Can I take your research and create a bootcamp that works? Track record says yes.\"\n\n## What success looks like\n\n**Short term:**\n- They engage with proposal and ask for a call\n- They share research reports\n- Contract signed by mid-late October\n\n**Medium term:**\n- Research phase yields useful material\n- First curriculum draft lands well\n- They appreciate the traditional knowledge angle\n\n**Long term:**\n- Bootcamp runs successfully in Erbil\n- Entrepreneurs launch ventures\n- You're back for more curriculum projects\n\n## Research reports to study\n\nOnce you get their three reports, immediately read and:\n1. Map findings to curriculum modules\n2. Identify gaps the interviews could fill\n3. Share initial insights in first check-in\n\nAlso study these:\n1. **UNEP Food Waste Index 2024** - Global methodology\n2. **Filimonau et al. (2023)** - Iraqi restaurant food waste, cultural factors\n3. **FAO Arab World Food Loss** - Regional context (210kg per capita)\n4. **Traditional Iraqi Fermented Foods (2022)** - Your traditional knowledge source\n5. **NRC Iraq Drought Report (Nov 2024)** - Current food security context\n\n## What you need from them\n\n1. Three research phase reports\n2. Current 4-day bootcamp structure\n3. Any existing food waste materials or pilots\n\nDon't wait—ask for these in your email.\n\n## If they counter-offer on scope/budget\n\n**Flexible areas:**\n- Number of case studies (can do fewer)\n- Interview count (can do 5 instead of 10)\n- Impact framework complexity (can simplify)\n- Follow-up coaching (can drop)\n\n**Not flexible:**\n- Quality of curriculum design\n- Thoroughness of research synthesis\n- Usability of materials\n\n## Next steps after sending\n\n1. Follow up in 3-4 days if no response\n2. Prepare for call: have TOR in front of you, be ready to walk through approach\n3. Ask them questions: \"What's most important to you?\" \"What worried you about other consultants?\"\n4. Be flexible on scope, firm on value\n5. Express genuine interest without being desperate\n\n## Talking points\n\n**On traditional knowledge:**\n\"Iraq has been doing circular economy for 7,500 years. I want entrepreneurs to see themselves as continuing that tradition, not just copying Western models.\"\n\n**On impact metrics:**\n\"For early-stage ventures, we need metrics that are achievable: kg saved, households reached, ventures launched. I'll design a framework that tracks outcomes without overwhelming founders.\"\n\n**On your advantage:**\n\"I just delivered your climate curriculum.

You've done this for topics you didn't initially know (solar, insulation, architecture with ITC). Your Master's trained you for exactly this.\\n\\n**The gap is not a problem:** You're up front about not being a food scientist. Your value is synthesis + pedagogical design + cultural understanding + proven delivery with this specific client.\\n\\n## The traditional knowledge angle\\n\\n**Why include it:**\\n- Grounds abstract frameworks in local reality\\n- Creates business opportunities (commercializing traditional foods/techniques)\\n- Methodologically sound (participatory research)\\n- Differentiates you from generic consultants\\n\\n**How to defend it if they question:**\\n\\\"Traditional preservation methods are circular economy practices. Fermentation, sun-drying, seasonal eating\\u2014Iraq perfected these 7,500 years ago. I'm showing entrepreneurs how knowledge they already have connects to modern frameworks. And from a learning design perspective, people engage more when content links to their cultural experience.\\\"\\n\\n**If they say it's too fuzzy:**\\n\\\"It's 8-10 interviews with structured questions. I'll extract business models, not write poetry. If you want me to skip it and stick purely to your research reports, I can do that.\\\"\\n\\n## Budget defense\\n\\nBase: 5.5M IQD (~$4,200)\\n\\n**If they say it's high:**\\n\\\"Your climate project was 4M IQD for 5 weeks with one deliverable stream. This is 6 weeks with five parallel tracks (research, curriculum, materials, impact framework, ToT) and the 4-day bootcamp compression is harder than spreading content over 32 sessions. I've priced it transparently. But if budget is tight, tell me what you can afford and I'll propose a reduced scope.\\\"\\n\\n**If they say they can hire locally for less:**\\n\\\"Maybe. My advantage is I just delivered your climate curriculum, so I know your system from inside. I bring international practice from Bloom's 16-country network. I'm fluent in Arabic. And I have educational credentials. But I respect budget constraints\\u2014let me know what number works.\\\"\\n\\n## Common objections\\n\\n**\\\"We need food systems expertise\\\"**\\n\\nAnswer: \\\"You need someone who can turn your research into curriculum. That's curriculum design expertise, which is what I do. I'll validate food systems content through Shariha Khalid and your own research reports. The pedagogical architecture is my job.\\\"\\n\\n**\\\"Can you do this remotely?\\\"**\\n\\nAnswer: \\\"Yes. We just proved it with climate curriculum. The only value of in-person is hands-on ToT practice, but even that works virtually.\\\"\\n\\n**\\\"We're considering other candidates\\\"**\\n\\nAnswer: \\\"Fair. I'd ask: how many already delivered a curriculum for you successfully? How many know your bootcamp pedagogy from inside? My advantage is continuity and proven delivery. But no pressure\\u2014I get it if you need a different profile.\\\"\\n\\n## If they ask about food systems background\\n\\n\\\"I'm not a food scientist and I'm not claiming to be. I'm a curriculum designer who's good at research synthesis. I've done this for solar energy, architecture, and insulation with ITC\\u2014all areas I didn't know at the start.\\n\\nWhat I bring:\\n- Pedagogical design (my Master's specialty)\\n- Research synthesis (extracting actionable insights)\\n- Cultural understanding (Iraqi-American, Arabic speaker)\\n- Technical network (Shariha Khalid, food systems practitioners)\\n- Proven delivery with you specifically\\n\\nThe question is: Can I take your research and create a bootcamp that works? Track record says yes.\\\"\\n\\n## What success looks like\\n\\n**Short term:**\\n- They engage with proposal and ask for a call\\n- They share research reports\\n- Contract signed by mid-late October\\n\\n**Medium term:**\\n- Research phase yields useful material\\n- First curriculum draft lands well\\n- They appreciate the traditional knowledge angle\\n\\n**Long term:**\\n- Bootcamp runs successfully in Erbil\\n- Entrepreneurs launch ventures\\n- You're back for more curriculum projects\\n\\n## Research reports to study\\n\\nOnce you get their three reports, immediately read and:\\n1. Map findings to curriculum modules\\n2. Identify gaps the interviews could fill\\n3. Share initial insights in first check-in\\n\\nAlso study these:\\n1. **UNEP Food Waste Index 2024** - Global methodology\\n2. **Filimonau et al. (2023)** - Iraqi restaurant food waste, cultural factors\\n3. **FAO Arab World Food Loss** - Regional context (210kg per capita)\\n4. **Traditional Iraqi Fermented Foods (2022)** - Your traditional knowledge source\\n5. **NRC Iraq Drought Report (Nov 2024)** - Current food security context\\n\\n## What you need from them\\n\\n1. Three research phase reports\\n2. Current 4-day bootcamp structure\\n3. Any existing food waste materials or pilots\\n\\nDon't wait\\u2014ask for these in your email.\\n\\n## If they counter-offer on scope/budget\\n\\n**Flexible areas:**\\n- Number of case studies (can do fewer)\\n- Interview count (can do 5 instead of 10)\\n- Impact framework complexity (can simplify)\\n- Follow-up coaching (can drop)\\n\\n**Not flexible:**\\n- Quality of curriculum design\\n- Thoroughness of research synthesis\\n- Usability of materials\\n\\n## Next steps after sending\\n\\n1. Follow up in 3-4 days if no response\\n2. Prepare for call: have TOR in front of you, be ready to walk through approach\\n3. Ask them questions: \\\"What's most important to you?\\\" \\\"What worried you about other consultants?\\\"\\n4. Be flexible on scope, firm on value\\n5. Express genuine interest without being desperate\\n\\n## Talking points\\n\\n**On traditional knowledge:**\\n\\\"Iraq has been doing circular economy for 7,500 years. I want entrepreneurs to see themselves as continuing that tradition, not just copying Western models.\\\"\\n\\n**On impact metrics:**\\n\\\"For early-stage ventures, we need metrics that are achievable: kg saved, households reached, ventures launched. I'll design a framework that tracks outcomes without overwhelming founders.\\\"\\n\\n**On your advantage:**\\n\\\"I just delivered your climate curriculum. I know your bootcamp energy, your community, your context. A new consultant needs weeks of onboarding. I can contribute from day one.\\\"\\n\\n**On timeline:**\\n\\\"Late October through early December works for me.

Look at the strategy notes. Are they useful or just motivational?\n\nIf anything still sounds off, tell me which lines and I'll fix them.\n\n---\n\n## What's Actually Good Here\n\n**Your positioning is honest:** \"I'm not a food systems expert—my strength is curriculum adaptation.\"\n\n**The traditional knowledge angle has substance:** 8-10 interviews with structured questions, not vague cultural appreciation.\n\n**The budget is transparent:** Clear breakdown, options for scaling up/down.\n\n**The tone matches your context:** You've worked with them before. The casualness reflects that relationship.\n\n---\n\n## What to Do Now\n\n1. **Read through everything** - Mark any lines that still sound weird\n2. **Adjust if needed** - Tell me what to change\n3. **Send it** - Attach the proposal, paste the email\n4. **Follow up in 3-4 days** if you don't hear back\n\nThe proposal is 6 pages now (down from 9).

My role is to turn research into practical training that helps founders test real solutions.\n\nI previously adapted your climate curriculum.

I'm here to learn from people doing this work, \nnot reinvent wheels.\n```\n\n### Made it more honest\n\n**In email:**\n\"Not to write cultural features, but to find business models that connect to what people already do. If you think that's useful, I'll include it. If you'd rather I stick purely to your research reports, that works too.\"\n\n**In proposal note:**\n\"This is about finding what already works and connecting it to modern business tools, not cultural decoration.\"\n\n---\n\n## What Works Better Now\n\n1. **Positioning is collaborative, not heroic:** You're facilitating, synthesizing, learning—not delivering from on high.\n\n2. **Shariha and Saad are integrated naturally:** Shows you have a network and you're using it to learn.\n\n3. **Traditional knowledge is optional:** Framed as \"if you think this is useful\" rather than \"here's what I'm doing.\"\n\n4. **Less declarative overall:** \"You need X\" instead of \"I do X\"\n\n5. **Stays humble:** \"I'm here to learn from people doing this work\" is way better than \"I make it work.\"\n\n---\n\n## Strategy Notes Now Include\n\nA whole section on \"Regional collaboration strategy\" with talking points:\n\n\"I'm not coming in as the expert on food systems. I'm facilitating curriculum development by learning from Shariha Khalid on circular economy, Saad Chinoy on regional context, local practitioners in Erbil, and your own research.\"\n\n---\n\n## Test\n\nRead the opening of the FINAL proposal out loud.

I'm not a food systems expert, but I know how to adapt complex topics into usable curriculum for this context.\n\n---\n\n## Approach\n\n### Research synthesis (weeks 1-2)\n\n**Study the research**\n- Your three project reports\n- Supporting background: UNEP Food Waste Index 2024, Iraqi food systems studies, regional redistribution models\n- Extract what's actionable: surplus sources, partner types, unit economics, simple operations\n\n**Learn from practitioners**\n- Talk to Shariha Khalid (World Food Hub / Impact Hub) about regional food systems work\n- Connect with Saad Chinoy and others working on this regionally\n- 8-10 short conversations with families and small producers in Erbil about preservation methods (turshi, laban, sun-drying, date products)\n- Pull out techniques that could become business models\n\n**Deliverable:** Integration brief showing how research + regional practice + local knowledge map to each bootcamp module\n\n### Bootcamp adaptation (weeks 3-4)\n\n**Build the flow**\n- Thread food waste and security through your existing stages: ideation, customer discovery, BMC, prototyping, pitching\n- Create worksheets:\n  - Surplus-mapping canvas for identifying sources\n  - Partner outreach scripts (restaurants, markets, caterers)\n  - BMC version with \"kg saved\" and \"meals equivalent\" alongside revenue\n  - Simple costing sheet for redistribution economics\n\n**Case studies**\n- 3-4 examples you can actually use: regional redistribution models, Iraqi preservation-based products\n- Focus on what's replicable in Erbil, not aspirational stories\n\n**Materials**\n- Trainer slides with timed run-of-show and speaker notes\n- Participant workbook with canvases, checklists, exercises\n- All editable (Google Docs/Slides)\n\n**Deliverable:** Complete 4-day curriculum ready to run\n\n### Impact framework + ToT (weeks 5-6)\n\n**Keep metrics simple**\n- Core: kg saved, households/meals reached, ventures launched, basic revenue\n- Optional: food miles, preservation methods used, partners onboarded\n- Provide definitions, simple tracker sheet, lightweight dashboard template\n\n**Train the trainers**\n- One virtual ToT (2-3 hours): walkthrough, practice, Q&A\n- Include prompts for trainers to surface local knowledge during delivery\n- Optional follow-up clinics or in-person session in Erbil if budget allows\n\n**Deliverable:** Impact kit + ToT session + revisions based on feedback\n\n---\n\n## Work plan (6 weeks: late Oct–early Dec 2025)\n\n| Step | Deliverables | Timing |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| Research synthesis | Integration brief + case notes | Weeks 1-2 |\n| Curriculum adaptation | Updated 4-day flow + tools | Weeks 3-4 |\n| Materials + impact kit | Slides, guide, workbook, tracker | Week 5 |\n| ToT + finalization | ToT session, revisions, handover | Week 6 |\n\nCheck-ins: Weekly or biweekly, your call.\n\n---\n\n## Fees\n\n**Base (remote): 5,500,000 IQD** (~$4,200)\n\n| Item | IQD |\n|------|-----|\n| Research synthesis & integration | 1,200,000 |\n| Curriculum adaptation (4-day) | 1,800,000 |\n| Materials (slides, guide, workbook) | 1,000,000 |\n| Impact framework kit | 700,000 |\n| ToT (virtual) + revisions | 800,000 |\n| **Total** | **5,500,000** |\n\n**Options**\n- In-person ToT in Erbil: +1,300,000 IQD (~$1,000) + travel at cost\n- Follow-up trainer coaching (3 virtual clinics): +520,000 IQD (~$400)\n- Arabic/Kurdish glossary or translation QA: scope and rate to be agreed\n\n---\n\n## Payment terms\n\n50% on signing, 50% on completion (expected early December 2025).

I'm facilitating curriculum development by learning from Shariha Khalid on circular economy, Saad Chinoy on regional context, local practitioners in Erbil, and your own research. That collaborative approach produces better training than me trying to be the solo expert.\"\n    37\t\n    38\t**If they ask who Saad Chinoy is:**\n    39\t\"Regional food systems practitioner. I'm connecting with him and Shariha to understand what's actually working in MENA food waste/security initiatives. This helps me adapt your research into locally appropriate training.\"\n    40\t\n    41\t**Key point:** You're positioning as a facilitator/synthesizer who brings people together, not a lone consultant claiming to know everything.

I've priced it transparently. But if budget is tight, tell me what you can afford and I'll propose a reduced scope.\"\n    49\t\n    50\t**If they say they can hire locally for less:**\n    51\t\"Maybe. My advantage is I just delivered your climate curriculum, so I know your system from inside. I bring international practice from Bloom's 16-country network. I'm fluent in Arabic.

The second is honest about your collaborative process.\n\n### Regional Collaboration Added\n\n**New section in proposal:**\n```\n## Regional advisors\n\nI'll be working with:\n- Shariha Khalid (World Food Hub, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur)\n- Saad Chinoy (regional context and connections)\n- Your team and local practitioners in Erbil\n\nThis isn't solo consulting—it's collaborative curriculum development \ndrawing on regional knowledge.\n```\n\nThis is huge. Shows you're:\n- Learning, not just delivering\n- Bringing credible voices\n- Facilitating collaboration, not claiming expertise\n\n### Traditional Knowledge Reframed\n\n**Before:** \"8-10 short interviews with families in Erbil\"  \n**After:** \"8-10 conversations with families and small producers about preservation methods... Focus: what techniques could become business models? What knowledge is at risk of being lost?\"\n\nAdded urgency and purpose.

I'm facilitating curriculum development by learning from your research, Shariha Khalid's circular economy work, Saad Chinoy's regional context, and local practitioners in Erbil. That collaborative approach produces better training than solo consulting.\"\n\n---\n\n## What to Send\n\n**Use the FINAL versions:**\n- five_one_labs_proposal_FINAL.md\n- five_one_labs_email_FINAL.md\n\n**The old versions are there for comparison but don't send them.**\n\n---\n\n## Any Last Tweaks?\n\nIf anything still sounds off or doesn't feel like you, tell me:\n1. Which lines?\n2. What bothers you about them?\n3. How would you actually say it?\n\nI'll adjust immediately.\n\nOtherwise, you're ready to send.

Any existing food waste/security materials or partner contacts\n\nHappy to sign an NDA for proprietary materials.\n\n---\n\n## Regional advisors\n\nI'll be working with:\n- **Shariha Khalid** (World Food Hub, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur) - food systems and circular economy\n- **Saad Chinoy** - regional context and connections\n- Your team and local practitioners in Erbil\n\nThis isn't solo consulting—it's collaborative curriculum development drawing on regional knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## Note on traditional knowledge\n\nWhere it supports venture logic, I'll include Iraqi preservation practices (fermentation, drying, date products) as business paths. This is optional and will be scoped to what actually helps bootcamp outcomes. Not decoration—practical applications entrepreneurs can test.\n\n---\n\n## Past work\n\nAvailable on request:\n- Climate curriculum (January-February 2025)\n- Bloom's ToT frameworks: bloom.pm\n- ITC curriculum projects (solar, insulation, architecture)\n\n---\n\n## Contact\n\nBilal Ghalib  \nbg@bilalghalib.com  \n+1-478-227-2253\n\nBased in Lille, France.

Current 4-day bootcamp structure (agenda, slides, or outline)\\n3. Any existing food waste/security materials or partner contacts\\n\\nHappy to sign an NDA for proprietary materials.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Regional advisors\\n\\nI'll be working with:\\n- **Shariha Khalid** (World Food Hub, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur) - food systems and circular economy\\n- **Saad Chinoy** - regional context and connections\\n- Your team and local practitioners in Erbil\\n\\nThis isn't solo consulting\\u2014it's collaborative curriculum development drawing on regional knowledge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Note on traditional knowledge\\n\\nWhere it supports venture logic, I'll include Iraqi preservation practices (fermentation, drying, date products) as business paths. This is optional and will be scoped to what actually helps bootcamp outcomes. Not decoration\\u2014practical applications entrepreneurs can test.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Past work\\n\\nAvailable on request:\\n- Climate curriculum (January-February 2025)\\n- Bloom's ToT frameworks: bloom.pm\\n- ITC curriculum projects (solar, insulation, architecture)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Contact\\n\\nBilal Ghalib  \\nbg@bilalghalib.com  \\n+1-478-227-2253\\n\\nBased in Lille, France.

I'm facilitating curriculum development by learning from Shariha Khalid on circular economy, Saad Chinoy on regional context, local practitioners in Erbil, and your own research. That collaborative approach produces better training than me trying to be the solo expert.\"\n\n**If they ask who Saad Chinoy is:**\n\"Regional food systems practitioner. I'm connecting with him and Shariha to understand what's actually working in MENA food waste/security initiatives. This helps me adapt your research into locally appropriate training.\"\n\n**Key point:** You're positioning as a facilitator/synthesizer who brings people together, not a lone consultant claiming to know everything.

The second is honest about your collaborative process.\n\n### Regional Collaboration Added\n\n**New section in proposal:**\n```\n## Regional advisors\n\nI'll be working with:\n- Shariha Khalid (World Food Hub, Impact Hub Kuala Lumpur)\n- Saad Chinoy (regional context and connections)\n- Your team and local practitioners in Erbil\n\nThis isn't solo consulting—it's collaborative curriculum development \ndrawing on regional knowledge.\n```\n\nThis is huge. Shows you're:\n- Learning, not just delivering\n- Bringing credible voices\n- Facilitating collaboration, not claiming expertise\n\n### Traditional Knowledge Reframed\n\n**Before:** \"8-10 short interviews with families in Erbil\"  \n**After:** \"8-10 conversations with families and small producers about preservation methods... Focus: what techniques could become business models? What knowledge is at risk of being lost?\"\n\nAdded urgency and purpose. Not decoration—preservation.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Quick Comparison\n\n| Element | My First Draft | ChatGPT Version | Final Merged |\n|---------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **Tone** | Conversational but wordy | Tighter but still formal | Clean and collaborative |\n| **Positioning** | \"I will deliver\" | \"I take research\" | \"I work with\" |\n| **Length** | 9 pages | 6 pages | 6 pages |\n| **Collaboration** | Mentioned Shariha | \"Light-touch review\" | Full regional team |\n| **Arrogance** | Some solo-hero vibes | Worse (more arrogant) | Removed completely |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ What's Better in Final Version\n\n1. **Honest about your process** - You'll be learning from Shariha, Saad, local families, not arriving with all answers\n\n2. **More credible** - \"Working with Shariha Khalid and Saad Chinoy\" > \"I have technical advisors\"\n\n3. **Reduces their risk** - Shows you won't be solo-flying on food systems content\n\n4. **Culturally appropriate** - Collaborative approach fits SWANA context better than Western solo-expert model\n\n5. **Better for you too** - Lets you actually learn without faking expertise\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Key Positioning Shift\n\n**Old mindset:** I'm the curriculum expert who will adapt their research  \n**New mindset:** I'm facilitating curriculum development by bringing together research, regional practitioners, and pedagogical design\n\nThis isn't just wording—it's a more accurate description of what you'll actually do.\n\n---\n\n## 🎤 How to Talk About It\n\nWhen they ask about your food systems background:\n\n**Don't say:** \"I've done similar adaptations before\"  \n**Say:** \"I'm not a food scientist. I'm facilitating curriculum development by learning from your research, Shariha Khalid's circular economy work, Saad Chinoy's regional context, and local practitioners in Erbil. That collaborative approach produces better training than solo consulting.\"\n\n---\n\n## What to Send\n\n**Use the FINAL versions:**\n- five_one_labs_proposal_FINAL.md\n- five_one_labs_email_FINAL.md\n\n**The old versions are there for comparison but don't send them.**\n\n---\n\n## Any Last Tweaks?\n\nIf anything still sounds off or doesn't feel like you, tell me:\n1. Which lines?\n2. What bothers you about them?\n3. How would you actually say it?\n\nI'll adjust immediately.\n\nOtherwise, you're ready to send. This version is honest, collaborative, specific, and sounds like you.",

I build on what's already working, not from scratch.\n\n**Cultural context:** Iraqi-American, Arabic speaker. Learned preservation methods from my grandmother in Baghdad—basturma, dried meats, date vinegar. These lived practices keep me grounded in the context while staying professional.\n\n**Entrepreneurship background:** Co-founder of Bloom, supported 933+ ventures across 16 countries. Experienced in accelerators and ToT, focused on what works under time pressure.\n\n---\n\n## Note on Local Knowledge\n\nWhere it supports entrepreneurial outcomes, I'll include Iraqi preservation techniques as business opportunities.
