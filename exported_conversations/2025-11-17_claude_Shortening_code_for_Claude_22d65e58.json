  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user requested help condensing a VX Audit methodology document that was causing issues with Claude Code due to its length. The original document outlined a comprehensive values-through-code analysis framework for tracing how actual code supports or hinders what users find meaningful. Claude condensed the methodology from approximately 1200 words to 500 words while preserving the essential structure and actionable elements.\n\nThe methodology involves five phases: identifying diverse personas, defining their values as Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs), tracing values through affordances to code implementation, conducting alignment analysis, and producing a structured report. Claude retained the specific CAP formatting requirements (starting with plural noun phrases, adding qualifiers, maintaining actor perspective), the complete report template structure, and key principles while removing repetitive examples and verbose explanations.\n\nClaude also provided strategic feedback that the VX Audit methodology might be too heavyweight for Claude Code's context, suggesting the user might achieve better results running the analysis in the main Claude interface for philosophical analysis, then translating findings into actionable code changes in Claude Code. The user demonstrated familiarity with both Claude interfaces and appeared to be working on code analysis projects that require balancing user values with technical implementation.",

I want you to conduct a Values Experience (VX) audit using this methodology: Your Task Phase 1: Identify Diverse Customer Personas Review the codebase, README, documentation, issues, and any user-facing materials Identify 5 diverse potential customers/users who would use this project Make them meaningfully different (different contexts, needs, backgrounds) For each, write a brief persona (2-3 sentences about who they are and their situation) Phase 2: Infer Values for Each Persona For each customer, identify 3-4 specific things they would pay attention to that are meaningful to them (not just instrumental). Format these as Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs): Start with PLURAL NOUN PHRASE in caps Follow with specific qualifier Write from actor's perspective Be concrete, not abstract Examples: ✓ \"MOMENTS when a student's confusion becomes curiosity rather than defeat\" ✓ \"SIGNS that a system respects my autonomy rather than manipulating my choices\" ✗ \"User-friendly design\" (too vague) ✗ \"Fast performance\" (instrumental, not constitutive) How to infer values: What problems would this person be trying to solve? What would feel meaningful vs merely functional to them? What past experiences might shape what they pay attention to? If they chose this tool over alternatives, what would they be choosing for? Phase 3: VX Trace for Each Persona For each customer, trace through these layers: VALUES (CAPs) List their 3-4 constitutive attentional policies AFFORDANCES What does our project make possible or impossible for them? What can they discover/do/become? What paths are opened or closed? What agency do they have? UX (User Experience) What do they actually experience when using it? What flows exist? What do they encounter? What choices do they face? UI (User Interface) What can they see and interact with? What's visible/hidden? What interactions are available? What information is surfaced? CODE What actual implementation creates this? What specific files/functions? What technical decisions? What's in the codebase that creates this layer? Phase 4: Alignment Analysis For each persona and each of their values, assess: ✓ SUPPORTS: Where code→UI→UX→affordances actively help them live by this value Be specific: \"The [X feature in Y file] creates [Z affordance] which lets them [attention to...]\" ✗ HINDERS: Where implementation works against their values Specific examples with code references ? MISSED OPPORTUNITY: Where we could better support their values Concrete suggestions Phase 5: Generate VX Audit Report Create a markdown file VX_AUDIT.md with this structure: markdown# VX Audit: [Project Name] Date: [Today's date] Repository: [URL] Executive Summary [2-3 sentences on overall value alignment] Persona 1: [Name/Type] Who They Are [Description] Their Values (CAPs) [CAP 1] [CAP 2] [CAP 3] VX Trace: Values → Code Values Layer [Their CAPs with brief context] Affordances Layer [What our project enables/constrains] UX Layer [What they experience] UI Layer [What they see/interact with] Code Layer [Specific implementations - file paths, functions] Alignment Analysis ✓ Supports Their Values [Value]: [How code supports it - specific examples] ✗ Hinders Their Values [Value]: [How code works against it - specific examples] ? Missed Opportunities [Value]: [What could be changed - actionable suggestions] [Repeat for Personas 2-5] Cross-Cutting Insights Patterns Across Personas [What values are consistently supported/hindered?] Architectural Decisions [How do core technical choices affect value alignment?] Recommendations by Priority High Priority (Affects Multiple Personas) [Recommendation with code changes needed] Medium Priority [...] Low Priority [...] Questions for the Team [Things to discuss - where values might conflict, where we need more user insight] Important Guidelines When inferring values: Avoid generic statements (\"wants it to be easy\") Get specific about what they'd pay attention to Think about what would feel meaningful, not just functional Consider their context and what shaped their attention When tracing: Always connect back to actual code with file paths Be specific about cause and effect through layers Don't just describe - show the connections When assessing alignment: Give concrete examples with line references where possible Explain why something supports/hinders Make recommendations actionable Writing style: Professional but clear Specific over abstract Evidence-based (cite actual code) Avoid jargon in the personas/values, use technical precision in code layer Start Your Analysis Begin by exploring the repository structure, README, and any documentation. Then identify your 5 diverse personas and proceed through the analysis. Create the VX_AUDIT.md file when complete. Execute this analysis now for the current repository."
