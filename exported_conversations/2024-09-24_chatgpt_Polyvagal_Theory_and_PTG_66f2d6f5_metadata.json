While suffering and trauma are undeniably painful, Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) offers a silver lining, a potential to emerge from the darkest moments stronger, wiser, and more resilient. This transformative process invites individuals to look beyond their wounds and seek the potential for personal growth. By embracing the idea of PTG, individuals can find solace in knowing that their struggles can have meaning and purpose, which may ultimately lead to a richer, more meaningful life.\n\nPTG is mostly a natural process that happens to some individuals after going through traumatic experiences, but it can also be facilitated, as demonstrated by the pioneering work of the renowned psychologists Richard Tedeschi, PhD, and Lawrence Calhoun, PhD.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore a facilitator\u2019s way of relating called expert companionship, a theoretical model of PTG and how it is different from resilience, the right time for introduction of PTG, and the five elements of facilitation that can help individuals rebuild their lives after experiencing trauma. Practitioners will find the series of infographics invaluable as useful reference in understanding and applying the principles of facilitating PTG. These visual aids, adapted from Tedeschi\u2019s presentations, distill complex concepts into easily digestible formats, providing a quick reference guide for those working in the field.\n\nRemember, trauma may be a part of life, but it doesn\u2019t have to...[truncated]",

For teenagers, he added, this capacity is even greater. Adolescence is a period \u201cwhen people are more open to rethinking things,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they, in their openness, can be pretty good at recognizing growth.\u201d\n\nThis openness, however, doesn\u2019t mean parents should push. Eranda Jayawickreme, a professor of psychology at Wake Forest University who studies post-traumatic growth, warned against pressuring children in a Pollyannaish way, making them think, \u201cnot only am I coping with this terrible thing, you\u2019re telling me now that I\u2019m supposed to grow?\u201d\n\nInstead, parents and caregivers may serve as \u201cexpert companions,\u201d Dr. Tedeschi explained, guiding children to a new, and potentially better, place.\n\nTo do this, Dr. Tedeschi identified five strategies that he uses in his nonprofit, Boulder Crest Foundation, which works to foster post-traumatic growth in first-responders and veterans.\nTeach kids that adversity can bring gifts. You might use stories from your life or your family\u2019s spiritual tradition to explain how overcoming a difficulty can leave people stronger. Or, you can approach the same idea through brain science. For example, nonprofits like Turnaround for Children offer curriculums to teach kids about neuroplasticity, or the brain\u2019s ability to adapt and change when we take on challenges and learn new things.\n\nPrepare for difficult emotions. Sharing experience is essential for post-traumatic growth. But to effectively discuss and process those difficulties, children need techniques to deal with emotions like sadness, rage and anxiety.

We created it to help accelerators and program managers focus on impact and inclusive entrepreneurship in developing/emerging ecosystems through skill-based and character-based support. \nHow to use this step-by-step guide?\nRunning accelerator programs is a young and evolving field. With limited proven research into best practices, we do not wish to claim a set formula or one-size-fits-all approach. Accelerator models vary significantly depending on their objectives. \nInstead, the guide aims to help program managers understand some of the critical choices and challenges they'll need to consider if they're considering building a program of their own. It combines lessons from previous practices and patterns we identified over the years to highlight and frame the strategic choices facing stakeholders interested in creating and running these programs. \nWe developed this guide into two sections:\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework \ud83c\udf3b\nThis section will help you understand our framework and assessment suite.\nSection 2: Running an Accelerator Program \ud83c\udf1f\nThis section covers the critical aspects of creating and running an accelerator in six simple stages. Each stage comes with a series of toolkits to help you think about your plans and the context of accelerator design.\n\n\nSection 1: The Bloom Framework \ud83c\udf3b \nAlso here: Bloom Framework v0.9 - Two Pillars (draft)\nBloom's Training Framework offers a dynamic, adaptive learning environment for individuals, teams, and organizations through a guided project-based and cohort-based learning approach.

Data that were collected from 411 participants were subjected to analysis. Version 25 of SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) and PROCESS macro were used to analyze mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation effects.\n\nResults: Deliberate rumination mediated the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG. Gratitude moderated the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG. Finally, gratitude moderated the mediating effect of deliberate rumination on the relationship between intrusive rumination and PTG.\n\nConclusion: Deliberate rumination and gratitude facilitate PTG for traumatized adults. In particular, gratitude reinforces the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG.\n\nIntroduction\nNationwide surveys indicate that 71.9% of Korean (Seo et al., 2012) adults and 89% of American adults (Kilpatrick et al., 2013) experience at least one traumatic experience during their lifetime.

SPSS (23 version) and PROCESS (3.3 version) were used for correlation analyses, mediation analysis, and moderated mediation analysis.\n\nResults: (1) PTG was positively correlated with creativity, self-efficacy, and deliberate rumination. Creativity was positively correlated with self-efficacy and deliberate rumination. Deliberate rumination was positively correlated with self-efficacy. (2) Self-efficacy mediated the relationship between PTG and creativity. (3) Deliberate rumination moderated the second half of the path of \u201cPTG \u2192 self-efficacy \u2192 creativity.\u201d\n\nConclusions: PTG affected creativity directly and also indirectly through self-efficacy.

Previous research found that Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) could not be the only factor that becomes the cause for an individual\u2019s Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG); thus, research that describes the role of a mediator in both variables is needed. Since studies investigating ACEs among Indonesia participants are still lacking, this would be considered as initial research on the relations of ACEs and PTG.\n\nObjective:\n\nThis research was aimed to investigate how resilience becomes a mediator between children\u2019s traumatic experiences of ACEs and PTG.\n\nMethods:\n\nThis research used a quantitative correlational method to investigate the relation between the three examined variables: Adverse Childhood Experience (ACEs), Resilience, and Post-traumatic Growth (PTG). A total of 349 participants were participated in this research, with the age range from 12 to 65 years old, predominantly female (N = 271;77,7%).
