      "content": "One possible way to approach this problem is to look for a pattern in the given sequence of values of f(x) for x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. \n\nNotice that the difference between successive values of f(x) is increasing by 1 each time. That is, \n\nf(1) - f(0) = 2 - 1 = 1\nf(2) - f(1) = 4 - 2 = 2\nf(3) - f(2) = 7 - 4 = 3\nf(4) - f(3) = 11 - 7 = 4\n\nSo we can say that the nth difference of the sequence is n. \n\nUsing this observation, we can derive a formula for f(x) in terms of x. \n\nStarting with f(0) = 1, we can add the first difference to get f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nThen we add the second difference to get f(2) = 2 + 2 = 4. \n\nNext, we add the third difference to get f(3) = 4 + 3 = 7. \n\nFinally, we add the fourth difference to get f(4) = 7 + 4 = 11. \n\nTherefore, we can generalize this pattern and write:\n\nf(x) = f(x-1) + (x-1) + 1\n\nSubstituting f(0) = 1, we can calculate f(x) for any non-negative integer x:\n\nf(1) = f(0) + (1-1) + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2\nf(2) = f(1) + (2-1) + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\nf(3) = f(2) + (3-1) + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7\nf(4) = f(3) + (4-1) + 1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11\n\nTherefore, the formula for f(x) is:\n\nf(x) = f(x-1) + (x-1) + 1, where f(0) = 1.",
