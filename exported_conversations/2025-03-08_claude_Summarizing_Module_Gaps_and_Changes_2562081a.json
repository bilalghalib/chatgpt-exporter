The role of sustainability is expanded, incorporating discussions on greenwashing, circular economy models, and certifications (ISO, Fair Trade, LEED, B Corp) as ways to embed ethical and sustainable practices beyond marketing. The Unilever case study remains but is linked more explicitly to sustainability. A new section analyzing McDonald's European sustainability shift provides a critical lens on ethical branding. The session still concludes with an impact measurement activity but now emphasizes measuring sustainability impact as a core part of business ethics.\t\"- Shift from Compliance to Authenticity & Purpose: Ethics is reframed not just as following rules but as a strategic advantage for long-term success and resilience.\n- Stronger Sustainability Integration: The updated module embeds sustainability deeply into ethical business discussions, particularly through circular economy practices, ethical certifications, and greenwashing critiques.\n- Expanded Stakeholder Consideration: Now explicitly links business ethics to environmental impact and future generations (aligning with intergenerational equity).\n- Practical Application of Ethics in Business Strategy: The update moves beyond theoretical discussion by linking ethics to real-world business resilience, investor trust, and competitive advantage.\n- Critical Analysis of Greenwashing: The module now challenges entrepreneurs to differentiate real sustainability commitments from marketing tactics through case studies like McDonald’s.\"\t\t\n1\tConsider mapping if there are any available special funds or other incentives targeted for “green” businesses in the area. See p. 20 in the booklet.\tIncubator\t\"29. Financing Alternatives\n\n● Understand typical startup financing options.\n● Identify local financing alternatives that you can use,\n● Create an alternate post-incubation go-to-market strategy\"\tThe original module provided an overview of financing options for startups, covering debt, equity, angel investors, venture capital, microloans, and bootstrapping. It emphasized understanding financial strategies and creating a financing plan for businesses post-incubation. The content primarily focused on traditional business financing, without explicit connections to sustainability.\tThe updated module retains the core financing content but integrates sustainability-focused financing options. It introduces green funding sources, such as green loans, climate finance initiatives, and impact-driven investment strategies. Entrepreneurs are guided to explore financing aligned with environmental and social impact, leveraging sustainability as a competitive advantage.\t\"- Integration of Green Financing: Added new sections on sustainability-focused funding sources, such as green climate funds, low-interest loans for eco-businesses, and SDG-aligned financing.\n- Business Efficiency Workbook Link: Encourages businesses to review their efficiency and sustainability practices to attract green funding.\n- Investor Motivations & ESG: Expanded discussion on how impact investors prioritize sustainability, offering insights into metrics like energy savings and waste reduction.\n- Local Green Incentives: Includes Iraq Central Bank's Green Loans and other regional sustainability finance opportunities.\n- Practical Sustainability Integration: Entrepreneurs are encouraged to reflect on how sustainability can make their businesses more financially resilient and attractive to investors.\"\t29.

Risk and Crisis Management\n\n● Reflect on your decision-making style, and pinpoint strengths and weaknesses.\n● Set an initial risk management strategy and learn how to adapt it over time.\n● Learn a few strategies to adapt when you are in a crisis.\"\tThe original module focused on understanding decision-making styles, basic risk management strategies, and crisis response. It included an interactive Plane Crash Activity to help participants analyze their decision-making processes and group dynamics. The risk management section introduced basic risk identification, assessment, and mitigation techniques. Crisis management emphasized adapting to unexpected events and managing uncertainty.\tThe updated module retains the interactive decision-making exercise but integrates business-specific risk categories (e.g., power outages, supply chain issues). Risk management now includes adaptability to changing circumstances, such as climate impacts and market shifts. The module integrates efficiency and sustainability principles, encouraging participants to assess risks through a resilience framework. Crisis management introduces systematic crisis response planning and innovation-based adaptation strategies.\t\"- Sustainability Integration: Expanded risk categories to include environmental and supply chain resilience.\n- Efficiency & Risk Planning: Introduced the Risk Category Worksheet and Business Efficiency Workbook to help entrepreneurs preemptively address risks.\n- Business Resilience Focus: Encouraged proactive crisis management through adaptive decision-making and scenario planning rather than reactive approaches.\n- Practical Application: Expanded risk assessment tools and connected risk management strategies with business efficiency planning.\n- Green and Climate Risk Awareness: Addressed climate-related disruptions and sustainable business strategies.\"\t\t\n1\tHere you might consider doing a bit of research on what government policies (national, regional) and incentive schemes exist for supporting green businesses\tIncubator\t\"31. Investment in the Middle East\n\n● Go over some entrepreneurship and tech trends around the world and in the MENA region.\n● Identify challenges and opportunities in the region and place your business in the current context.\n● Discuss the different key actors in the region and brainstorm ways to work with the current players.\"\tThe original module covered the entrepreneurial landscape in MENA, focusing on trends, challenges, and opportunities in Iraq, investment dynamics, success stories, key players, and investor relations. It included key financial concepts like ROI, CAC, and due diligence but did not emphasize sustainability or efficiency.\tThe updated module retains the structure but integrates sustainability and efficiency. It highlights green investment trends (e.g., renewable energy, sustainability-linked finance), includes green funding opportunities, and incorporates business efficiency and risk mitigation as key elements investors look for. More emphasis is placed on Iraq’s resource stability, the role of green tech in investment, and how entrepreneurs can position themselves for sustainability-driven funding.\t\"- Introduced Green Investment Trends: Now includes data on green tech growth, renewable energy, and sustainability-linked funding in MENA.\n- Added a Green Tech Opportunity Section: Discusses how green business models can attract investors and government incentives.\n- Resource Stability as a Business Challenge: Recognizes fluctuating energy costs and infrastructure gaps in Iraq.\n- Alternative Financing Options: Added content on green loans, grants, and impact investing, providing actionable funding opportunities.\n- Risk Mitigation for Investors: Entrepreneurs are now encouraged to use the Business Efficiency Workbook to demonstrate efficiency gains and risk reduction strategies for investor engagement.\n- Sustainability in Investment Metrics: ROI, CAC, and other key investment metrics now include efficiency improvements (e.g., energy savings from solar).\n- Investor Pitching Strategy Shift: Entrepreneurs are now taught to frame sustainability as part of business resilience and cost-saving measures to appeal to modern investors.\"\t\t\n1\t\tIncubator\t\"32. Mindsets\n\n● Understand the various parts of the Business Model Canvas (BMC).\n● Fill in the parts of your own business model.\n● Identify assumptions you are making about your business model.\"\tThe original content focused on understanding mindsets as beliefs that influence behavior. It emphasized fixed vs growth mindsets and included activities to encourage self-reflection and confidence. Entrepreneurs were encouraged to develop key mindsets like decisiveness, resilience, and accountability. The session ended with a vision board activity focusing on personal values and business goals.\tThe updated content retains key elements such as mindset types, self-belief, and resilience but integrates sustainability-focused concepts. The revised version emphasizes values-driven leadership, adaptability, and opportunity spotting. It also introduces concepts like fairness and encourages businesses to align their goals with social and environmental impact. The vision board activity now emphasizes aligning values with sustainable actions and resource-conscious practices.\t\"- Integration of Sustainability: The growth mindset discussion now includes resilience in the face of environmental and market uncertainties.\n- Values-Driven Leadership: Introduced fairness, equity, and ethical decision-making as key mindsets.\n- Expanded Reflection: Encourages entrepreneurs to see opportunities in challenges, particularly in sustainable markets.\n- Process-Oriented Thinking: Shifted from purely outcome-driven success to continuous learning and iterative progress, mirroring sustainable business strategies.\n- Practical Application: Added a discussion on how sustainability thinking can drive business model innovation.\"\t\t"

Here are some tips on what to ask in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of a user interview:\r\n\r\nBeginning: In the beginning of the interview, you should ask opening questions to set people at ease and build rapport. You should not ask about sensitive topics. Instead, focus on setting the stage and bringing your interviewees on board so they’re comfortable enough to be, and remain, open with you. What you do at this stage can include the following:\r\nTelling participants what topics will be covered\r\nTelling participants how their data will be used\r\nAsking innocuous questions such as what their role is in their organization\r\nAsking concrete questions that are easy to answer\r\n\r\nMiddle: In the middle of the interview, you’re hitting high gear. Having established a direct channel with your interviewees (the users), you move on and ask the bulk of your questions, but maybe not in the order you had originally planned. Remember to:\r\nKeep the flow of the conversation as natural as possible, but cover the topics you want to cover.\r\nPick up on what participants have said earlier and get full replies to questions they have only partially answered.\r\nSteer participants back on track if they go too far off topic.\r\nShow that you have been listening.\r\nGo deeper where necessary\r\n\r\nEnd: At the end of the interview, you wrap up in a way that makes participants feel as though they have said what they wanted to say and that their answers are valuable. By this point, you will have managed to tie up any loose ends on matters that had not been clear before, and both you and they should be satisfied that the interview has brought all the issues out into the open. Things you should do include:\r\nAsking if there is anything participants would like to add.\r\nTelling your participants what you are going to do with their data and what the value is for them.\r\nThanking them for taking the time to help with your research. Above all, remember to conduct a pilot study before you start approaching real-life participants and tackling ‘organic’ interview settings. Also, always be sensitive to the fact that people are different and need different things!\r\"\t\"Effective Questions:\n- \"\"Tell me about your decision-making process...\"\"\n- \"\"What matters most when choosing [product/service]?\"\"\n- \"\"What challenges do you face with current solutions?\"\"\n- \"\"How do you evaluate different options?\"\"\n\nAvoid:\n- Leading questions about specific features\n- Yes/no questions about purchasing\n- Questions that assume user needs\nFacilitator Notes:\n\nFocus on open-ended questions that reveal genuine insights\nLet participants develop questions relevant to their business\nIf efficiency or cost topics arise, explore naturally\nTime: 10 minutes practice\nEncourage questions that uncover real user needs and behaviors\"\n\t17\t17\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"SAYS: “I love Asiacell because I never have a bad experience.”\n“I want something reliable.”\n“I don’t understand what to do from here.”\n\nTHINKS: “This is really annoying.”\r\n“Am I dumb for not understanding this?”\r\n\nDOES: Refreshes page several times.\r\nShops around to compare prices.\r\n\nFEELS: Impatient: pages load too slowly\r\nConfused: too many contradictory prices\r\nWorried: they are doing something wrong\"\t\"SAYS:\n\"\"I need something reliable\"\"\n\"\"Price is important but so is quality\"\"\n\"\"I want something that lasts\"\"\n\nTHINKS:\n\"\"Is this worth the investment?\"\"\n\"\"Will this solve my problem?\"\"\n\"\"Can I trust this solution?\"\"\n\nDOES:\nCompares options\nResearches before buying\nAsks others for recommendations\n\nFEELS:\nConcerned about making right choice\nWants value for money\nSeeks reliable solutions\n\nFacilitator Notes:\n\nKeep focus on understanding genuine user perspectives\nEncourage deep understanding of user decision-making\nAllow cost and reliability discussions to emerge naturally\nTime: 8 minutes brainstorming\nUse examples relevant to local context\"\n\t19\t19\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\tWhen conducting user interviews, make sure to include extreme users.

Take professional athletes for example, they know every part of their shoes because they wear them for hours every day. They know about what they love and hate about them. \r\nLet’s take another example. If we were designing a new type of seat in a car, who would the extreme user be? --- allow them to answer. Taxi drivers live in their cars. All day long they are sitting in the seats and probably know really specific details of what makes them comfortable or not. They might even share ideas on how it could be better.\r\"\t\"When conducting user interviews, include users at different ends of the spectrum:\r\n- Power users who use your product/service most frequently\r\n- Users in challenging environments or conditions\r\n- Early adopters of new solutions\r\n- Cost-sensitive users\r\n- Users with unique needs or constraints\r\n\nExample: For a car seat design\r\nTaxi drivers who spend 12+ hours daily in their vehicles\r\nDelivery drivers managing high mileage\r\nUsers in areas with rough road conditions\r\nFocus on business value of interviewing diverse users\r\nLet participants identify relevant extreme users for their context\r\nIf resource or cost discussions emerge, integrate them naturally\r\nTime: 5 minutes discussion\r\n\"\n\t21\t21\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\tCreate your research plan (They should come tomorrow morning with a DO, LOOK, LISTEN research plan that they will begin to implement tomorrow!)\r\tCreate your research plan.

If we want them to know about the product/value offered, we use different channels to reach them. Once we have reached the customer segments, we want to build relationships with them to get them coming back. Delivering value to your customers allows you to make sales and bring in revenue (maybe they even bring friends along). \r\nWhere have you seen this before? \r\nThis is what they did during Ignite!\r\nYou should have a clear picture of your customers, what they care about, how to reach them, and have an idea of how you will actually make money through this interaction. \r\n\r\nMove on to the left side:\r\nNext let’s look at all the key activities you need to do in order to make this a reality. You need to put in work and resources to build and deliver the value you promised to your customers. There are a lot of activities and resources that go into the consistent delivery of value to your customers (running your business). You usually can’t do it all yourself. In this case, you need to find the right partners to help you achieve your tasks. These partners can help by providing resources (human, financial, etc…) or by taking responsibility for some key activities. All of this costs money to do. \r\n\r\nConclusion: In the next slides, we are going to go point by point on the BMC to understand it more.

How do we get them? \r\nPotential answers:\r\nKey resources are the personnel, tools, and budget the team will need access to \r\nEvery business model requires Key Resources. Your resources allow your enterprise to create and offer a Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and earn revenues. \r\nDifferent Key Resources are needed depending on the type of business model (some business need a lot of cash on hand while others need a lot of human resources)\r\nKey resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired from key partners (including investors).\r\nExamples:\r\nPhysical resources (tangible assets)\r\nFinancial resources (cash), \r\nIntellectual resources\r\nHuman resources. \r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble identifying the right key activities, ask yourself the following:\r\nWhat Key Resources do our Value Propositions require?\r\nOur Distribution Channels?\r\nCustomer Relationships?\r\nRevenue Streams?\r\n\r\n--------\r\nMore details on different common key resources. There is no need to cover them in detail. If you cover these points, you should focus on when to use these types, talk about the pros and cons of each. It shouldn’t be about explaining definitions.\r\n--------\r\nTypes of Key Resources: Key Resources can be categorized as follows:\r\nPhysical: This category includes physical assets such as manufacturing facilities, buildings, vehicles, machines, systems, point-of-sales systems, and distribution networks. Retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon.com rely heavily on physical resources, which are often capital-intensive. The former has an enormous global network of stores and related logistics infrastructure. The latter has an extensive IT, warehouse, and logistics infrastructure.\r\nIntellectual Property: Intellectual property resources such as brands, proprietary knowledge, patents and copyrights, partnerships, and customer databases are increasingly important components of a strong business model. Intellectual property resources are difficult to develop but when successfully created may offer substantial value. Consumer goods companies such as Nike and Sony rely heavily on their brand as a Key Resource. Microsoft and SAP depend on software and related intellectual property developed over many years. Qualcomm, a designer and supplier of chipsets for broadband mobile devices, built its business model around patented microchip designs that earn the company substantial licensing fees.\r\nHuman: Every enterprise requires human resources, but people are particularly prominent in certain business models. For example, human resources are crucial in knowledge-intensive and creative industries. A pharmaceutical company such as Novartis, for example, relies heavily on human resources: its business model is predicated on an army of experienced scientists and a large and skilled sales force.\r\nFinancial: Some business models call for financial resources and/or financial guarantees, such as cash, lines of credit, or a stock option pool for hiring key employees. Ericsson, the telecom manufacturer, provides an example of financial resource leverage within a business model. Ericsson may opt to borrow funds from banks and capital markets, then use a portion of the proceeds to provide vendor financing to equipment customers, thus ensuring that orders are placed with Ericsson rather than competitors.\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Discussion (5 minutes)\r\nPrompt:\r\nWhat are key resources? How do we get them?\r\nPotential answers:\r\nKey resources are the personnel, tools, and budget the team will need access to.\r\nEvery business model requires Key Resources—these enable an enterprise to:\r\nCreate and offer a Value Proposition\r\nReach markets and maintain Customer Relationships\r\nGenerate Revenue Streams\r\nDifferent businesses rely on different types of key resources.\r\nSome require high cash flow (e.g., retail, manufacturing).\r\nOthers rely on skilled human resources (e.g., consulting, software development).\r\nKey resources can be owned, leased, or acquired from key partners (e.g., investors, suppliers, collaborators).\r\n\r\nRefining the Discussion with Values & Resilience Considerations\r\nExpand the conversation beyond traditional resources by integrating values-aligned resources:\r\nHow do your key resources align with your values?\r\nExample: Tech company deciding between high-speed but energy-intensive servers vs. solar-powered servers.\r\nWhich resources are most vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, price volatility, or regulation changes?\r\nExample: Businesses that relied on non-renewable materials saw supply chain delays during COVID.\r\nMitigation: Consider sustainable alternatives that increase stability and reduce long-term costs.\r\nHow could prioritizing sustainability or ethical sourcing make your business more resilient?\r\nExample: Fair-trade coffee brands secure long-term supplier loyalty, ensuring stable pricing.\r\n\r\nKey Resource Categories & Considerations\r\n1. Physical Resources:\r\nFacilities, buildings, vehicles, hardware, logistics networks\r\nValues Lens: Are these resources energy-efficient, responsibly sourced, or adaptable?\r\nExample: A logistics company using fuel-efficient vehicles to reduce costs and emissions.\r\n2. Intellectual Property (IP):\r\nBrand identity, patents, proprietary technology, databases, algorithms\r\nValues Lens: Are these resources accessible, open-source, or ethically developed?\r\nExample: Open-source software companies that enable collaboration while maintaining a revenue model.\r\n3. Human Resources:\r\nEmployees, contractors, advisors\r\nValues Lens: Are hiring, retention, and training practices equitable, ethical, and inclusive?\r\nExample: Businesses that provide fair wages and growth opportunities retain employees longer.\r\n4. Financial Resources:\r\nCapital, investments, revenue streams\r\nValues Lens: Is funding aligned with the company’s mission? Are there ethical finance models?\r\nExample: A sustainable brand choosing impact investors over venture capital for long-term alignment.\r\n\r\nActivity – Resource Resilience Mapping (10 minutes)\r\nGoal: Help participants assess their resources beyond traditional needs—considering values, resilience, and efficiency.\r\nList Your Resources: Identify the key resources required for business success.\r\nAssess Their Alignment: Are these resources chosen for cost, speed, sustainability, ethics, or resilience?\r\nRisk Assessment:\r\nWhich resources are most vulnerable to price fluctuations, shortages, or regulatory changes?\r\nCan alternatives improve stability? (e.g., renewable energy, local sourcing)\r\nValues Integration:\r\nHow could sustainability, ethics, or durability enhance long-term success?\r\nExample: If using imported raw materials, could switching to local suppliers reduce risk and support community businesses?\r\nReflection: Discuss findings with a partner or small group—what surprised them? Any action items identified?\"\"\r\n\"\n\t21\t25\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"Discuss: “How can values-driven investments—like technology or sustainability upgrades—reduce risks and increase profits?”\"\n\t28\t32\tAdded New Content\t\"\"\"Hotels will sign up on my application\r\n\r\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\r\n\r\nTravelers will use my app to book online\r\n\r\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Hotels will sign up on my application\n\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\n\nTravelers will use my app to book online\n\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\n\nFuel and food supply chains will not be disrupted due to war or climate change\"\"\"\n\t28\t32\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"\"\"Hotels will sign up on my application\r\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\r\nTravelers will use my app to book online\r\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\r\nEtc… \"\"\"\t\"\"\"Hotels will sign up on my application\r\nRestaurants, hotels, artisans, and other partners will share in their profits\r\nTravelers will use my app to book online\nResilience Assumptions: what if my supply costs increase by 50%\r\nKurdish people are willing to rent their rooms to a foreigner\r\nEtc… \"\"\"\n4.

This is a strategic question that should be based on your persona needs and overall marketing strategy. Make sure that what you are designing will pay off and transition into real sales. For instance, although it might be really cool to print your logo on hats and pens, maybe the business is still too early to benefit from this type of promotion. Maybe because of a limited budget, it is more effective to put that money into making flyers that will be shared over social media.\r\nMake sure to think about what marketing materials will work for your best segment opportunity. \r\n\r\nRecap: These are all things you can be working on creating. You might think it’s too soon to create things like a logo or business card, but actually it is the perfect time! They are so easy to do, and these small details can have a high impact on how people view you. Remind them that they should start creating a logo, business cards, website, Facebook page, and a few informational ads or flyers. You will start to meet people soon and need to start networking. Be memorable. Even if this logo or design changes in the future that is ok, only print a few of these as you test what people like or don’t like.

Some questions you might want to ask to encourage discussion include:\r\nCan someone tell me what they know about ethics?\r\nWhat do ethics look like in the business context? What are ethics in business? \r\nHow are business ethics and high ethical standards linked to business sustainability?\r\nWho are all of the people impacted by your business (stakeholders)? Why is it important to take care of them?\r\n\r\nSome of these points probably came up in the discussion. Maybe someone mentioned following the law as a part of ethics. Or not, so you can bring it up now. \r\nBasically, there are 2 types of ethics:\r\nCompliance based: This is doing the bare minimum. You follow the laws and do what you are supposed to do. The idea here is not to do any harm. However, sometimes the laws might not be perfect and still do harm. This is difficult because laws are different in different locations because of cultural differences. What might not be ethical in some cultures (child labor for instance), are perfectly accepted in other places in the world. \r\nDo no harm (hopefully)\r\nFollow laws\r\nFollow guidelines provided by an organization or group telling you what you can and can’t do. \r\nPenalties for violations\r\n\r\nValues based: Because laws aren’t perfect, they leave room for businesses to damage people, communities, and the environment. Based on personal choices and values (without disregarding logical business rationale), you can choose to have your business have a positive impact on society. It takes a bit of extra work, but your business will have an impact on so many people. Some people might argue that you have a moral duty to do good with your business. \r\nDo good. Do more than the minimum legal requirements and expectations to do what you think is right. \r\nCompany core values. Act with your company core values in mind.\r\nSelf regulation. Hold yourself accountable and do good even when nobody’s watching.\r\nExtra effort. Put in a little extra effort to be the best version of your business that can possibly exist.\"\"\"\t\"\"\"Kickoff (2-3 minutes):\r\n\"\"Let's discuss ethics as a foundation for aligning your business with authenticity, purpose, and resilience. Ethics aren’t just rules to follow—they represent your deeper 'why' and drive your business forward, especially in challenging times.\"\"\r\nDiscussion Questions (10 minutes):\r\nWhen someone says 'ethics,' what's the first thing that comes to your mind?\r\nHow can authenticity provide your business with unique advantages that competitors can't easily replicate?\r\nWhat impact does alignment with a founder's deepest values have on business success?\r\nCan you recall a moment when you felt genuinely alive and motivated by your work? How can that kind of energy enhance business performance?\r\nHave you seen examples where businesses succeeded specifically because they stayed true to their core values? What happened?\r\nWho are the stakeholders impacted by your business (customers, employees, local community, environment)? Why does considering their well-being contribute to your long-term success?\r\nEncourage participants to share real examples—situations where businesses either lost trust by cutting corners or built loyalty by sticking firmly to their values.\r\nAs the conversation progresses, highlight the two fundamental approaches to ethics:\r\nWrap-Up Points (2-3 minutes):\r\n\"\"We've talked about two main pathways businesses can take regarding ethics—Compliance-based and Values-based. Let's briefly explore each:\"\"\r\nCompliance-Based Ethics: Playing Safe\r\nDoing what's legally required—meeting regulations and avoiding penalties.\r\nPrimarily focused on avoiding problems and doing no harm.\r\nLimitations: Laws differ by location, and simply following rules doesn't create deeper connections with customers or employees.\r\nValues-Based Ethics: Igniting Purpose\r\nGoing beyond compliance because you have a meaningful purpose and clear core values.\r\nActing authentically, proactively, and ethically—even when nobody is watching—because your 'why' genuinely drives you.\r\nWillingness to put in extra effort aligned with your values, making your work more purposeful and fulfilling.\r\nWhy Values Ignite Your Business:\r\nCustomer Connection: People support businesses whose values align with theirs. Authenticity builds trust, loyalty, and lasting customer relationships.\r\nTeam Loyalty: Employees remain engaged and motivated when their work serves a meaningful purpose beyond financial compensation.\r\nLong-term Resilience: Businesses guided by strong, clear values can more effectively adapt to challenges and thrive amid uncertainty.\r\nCompetitive Edge: Authenticity differentiates your business clearly and powerfully in crowded markets.\r\nClosing Thought:\r\nWe aren't just building startups—we're cultivating purpose-driven businesses that attract customers, inspire communities, and stand the test of time. Ethics, grounded in authenticity and values, can become your a strategic advantage.\r\nAs Epictetus famously said:\r\n\"\"First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to.\"\"\"\n\t-\t4\tAdded New Content\t-\t\"\"\"5 Minutes: Discussion - Ethics: Living Values That Ignite Business Continued\r\nDiscussion Questions (2-3 minutes):\r\nWhat is your strong why?

That's where we're headed next.\"\"\"\"\"\n\t11\t14\tUpdated Wording in Slides\t\"\"\"HIGH STANDARDS\n\n5 minutes: Discussion\r\n\r\nSo how do the companies who are doing great legitimate work stand out from the others? Because of case studies like Unilever, being ethical or “green” is trendy now. There are so many people “greenwashing” to get good press to make people think they are doing good so that it will have a positive impact on their sales. \r\nAsk: Where have you seen this before? How are people faking ethics?\r\nGreen packaging or packaging with plants on it. \r\nCompanies that say one thing and do another.\r\nNatural gas/hydraulic fracking companies that advertise “clean” energy (it burns clean, but extracting it is very harmful for the environment).\r\n\r\nAsk: Given the fact that everyone wants to appear ethical, how do you stand out from the others? How do you separate the fakers from the people actually doing good work?\r\nActually do good things with evidence\r\nPut policies and procedures into place and enforce them\r\n3rd party product certifications:\r\nISO\r\nLEEDS certified\r\nOrganic\r\nFair trade\r\nRainforest alliance\r\nB certified\r\nEtc…\r\nHave these standards to avoid greenwashing “marketing”\"\"\"\t\"\"\"LIVING YOUR VALUES, NOT JUST MARKETING THEM\r\n\nFacilitator Notes (5 minutes: Discussion)\r\n\"\"We've talked about finding values that truly matter to you and activating them through the triple bottom line. But in a world where 'ethical' and 'green' have become marketing buzzwords, how do businesses that genuinely live their values stand out from those just wearing the costume?\"\"\r\nTransition: This disconnect between what companies claim and what they do has a name: 'greenwashing' or 'ethics washing.' It happens when values become marketing tools rather than authentic guides for decisions.\r\nAsk: \"\"How can your business demonstrate that your values run deeper than marketing? How do you build trust that your 'why' is genuine?\"\"\r\nGuide toward concrete answers:\r\n\"\"Make choices that might cost you something in the short term but align with your values\"\"\r\n\"\"Be transparent about both your successes and challenges\"\"\r\n\"\"Invite verification through certification programs relevant to your sector:\"\"\r\nISO standards for quality and environmental management\r\nOrganic certification for food products\r\nFair Trade for ethical supply chains\r\nB Corporation certification for overall social and environmental performance\r\n\r\n\r\nConnect back to meaning: The strongest businesses don't just meet standards—they set them based on what truly matters to them. When values come from an authentic source of meaning, customers don't just see compliance—they feel your authentic purpose and builds loyalty that marketing can't buy.\r\nApplication: Now, thinking about your specific business and the values we've been discussing, what's one concrete action you could take this month that would demonstrate your commitment isn't just talk?\"\"\"\n\t12\t15\tUpdated Wording in Speaker Notes\t\"\"\"1 hour and 15 minutes: Activity\r\n\r\nThink about your core values and the ideas we shared before. What will you do to accomplish your mission? How will you really accomplish those things and have an ACTIVATED BRAND PURPOSE? What problem is your business really solving? Think about your customers/employees/community needs and how you can best support them. Based on your mission statement and care values, what are 3 things you want to change in the world? You will create a system to create and measure your impact. You can measure impact in a lot of ways! Feel free to measure anything you want, but make sure you are measuring impact in a way that is aligned with your mission and business! If you are able to track what you are doing, you can make an impact report that would be useful to share with donors, investors, or even put on your website and share with your customers!\r\nWhat we will do now is look at a well known certification assessment that will help you evaluate your impact on all of the different stakeholders. \r\n\r\n1 hour: Activity\r\nFor the rest of the session, take each of these categories and list how you can impact each of these stakeholder groups. \r\nTake a B Impact Assessment for your business: https://app.bimpactassessment.net/login\r\nYou probably wont know all the answers to these questions, that is ok. It will help give you ideas to incorporate into your strategy and help you see where your business stands.\r\nKeep in mind, you need an 80 to pass and it is not an easy test to pass!\r\n\r\n 15 minutes: Share\r\nBreak into small groups of 3-5 people\r\nDiscuss the different strategies you thought of and get feedback from the group\r\nAre the ways they are choosing to measure impact aligned with their mission?\r\nShare ideas to help each business come up with really unique strategies to make a difference based on their particular business model!\"\"\"\t\"\"\"(5 minutes: Introduction & Set-Up)\r\nClearly connect this activity to the previous discussions:\r\nWe've talked extensively about ethics, authenticity, and avoiding greenwashing/values washing. Now it’s time to put this into action. Real business ethics means aligning what you say (your values) with what you actually do. Let's move beyond words and create a concrete, measurable way to activate your brand purpose.\r\nGuiding Questions (for entrepreneurs):\r\nWhat problem are you genuinely solving?\r\nWho benefits directly from your solution (customers, employees, community)?\r\nBased on your authentic core values, what three meaningful impacts do you want your business to have in the world?\r\nActivity Instructions (1 hour):\r\nClearly list your core values and your deeper \"\"why\"\" behind your business.\r\nIdentify at least three measurable actions your business can take that authentically embody these values and positively impact your stakeholders (People, Planet, Profit).\r\nDescribe specific ways you will measure and communicate these impacts:\r\nConsider customer surveys, storytelling, transparency initiatives, and formal impact reports.\r\nExplore widely recognized third-party certifications and assessments, such as:\r\nISO standards\r\nFair Trade Certification\r\nOrganic Certification\r\nLEED Certification\r\nRainforest Alliance\r\nB Corporation Certification\r\nTake the B Impact Assessment:\r\nLog in or create an account at B Impact Assessment.\r\nWork through the questions relevant to your business. It's okay if you don't know all the answers yet—use this as a tool to identify areas where you can integrate stronger practices and measurements aligned with your values.\r\nNote: A score of 80 or above indicates passing, and it is a challenging benchmark!\r\nGroup Activity (15 minutes: Small Group Discussions)\r\nBreak into groups of 3-5.\r\nShare your identified impacts, strategies, and measurement ideas.\r\nProvide and receive feedback: Are these strategies aligned clearly with your core mission and values? Are they realistically achievable and measurable?\r\nTrainer Tip: Encourage entrepreneurs to focus deeply on practical and meaningful metrics—ones that genuinely resonate with investors, customers, and stakeholders, demonstrating authenticity beyond superficial marketing.\"\"\"\n29.

              "content": "# Five One Labs Green Integration Summary\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document summarizes the changes made to integrate sustainability and efficiency principles into the Five One Labs curriculum. Rather than creating a separate \"green\" module, we've embedded these principles throughout the existing curriculum, reframing sustainability as a strategic business advantage with concrete benefits:\n\n- **Risk reduction and operational resilience**\n- **Cost efficiency and resource optimization**\n- **Market differentiation and customer loyalty**\n- **Long-term business viability**\n\n## Integration Approach\n\nOur approach focused on naturally weaving resilience concepts into existing business modules by:\n\n1. **Enhancing examples** with efficiency dimensions\n2. **Adding business case studies** that demonstrate the alignment between values and profitability\n3. **Incorporating risk assessment** into standard business planning frameworks\n4. **Updating facilitator notes** with discussion prompts about long-term business durability\n\n## Key Tools Developed\n\nThree core tools support the integration:\n\n1. **Business Efficiency Workbook**: Helps entrepreneurs identify efficiency opportunities, prioritize actions, and track progress\n2. **Risk Assessment Process**: Enables businesses to identify vulnerabilities and turn risks into opportunities\n3. **Green Ideas Brainstorm**: Provides prompts to help entrepreneurs identify potential environmental advantages\n\n## Module-by-Module Integration Summary\n\n### High Priority Modules (Priority 1)\n\n#### Introduction & Goal Setting (Incubator #1)\n- **Gap**: Foundational opportunity to embed sustainability goals from Day 1\n- **Changes**: Integrated sustainability into goal-setting framework, emphasizing how green principles improve business resilience and long-term financial success\n\n#### Intro to UX (Incubator #2)\n- **Gap**: High-impact chance to factor environmental constraints into user flows early on\n- **Changes**: Added \"Value-Informed Happy Paths\" to consider customer sustainability values alongside needs, showing how design choices influence consumer behavior\n\n#### BMC (Incubator #3)\n- **Gap**: Climate/TBL integration into Business Model Canvas can have cross-cutting impact\n- **Changes**: Transformed the BMC into a \"Sustainable Business Model,\" embedding green principles into every component while highlighting risk reduction and competitive advantages\n\n#### Cost Model (Incubator #9)\n- **Gap**: Resource efficiency can save costs; linking cost modeling to \"green ROI\" is beneficial\n- **Changes**: Introduced Strategic Efficiency Investments concept and Business Efficiency Workbook to identify cost reductions through sustainable choices\n\n#### Balance Sheet (Incubator #10)\n- **Gap**: Typically standard financials, though intangible \"eco-brand\" assets can be noted\n- **Changes**: Added sustainable CAPEX/OPEX strategies and ROI calculator for green investments, linking financial decisions to climate resilience\n\n#### Service Design (Incubator #11)\n- **Gap**: Opportunity to incorporate circular economy or end-of-life solutions in each service layer\n- **Changes**: Added \"Enduring Value\" layer to product framework and expanded service blueprinting to include sustainability-related operational efficiencies\n\n#### Personal Brand + Networking (Incubator #18)\n- **Gap**: \"Green personal branding\" is optional; local networks may or may not prioritize sustainability\n- **Changes**: Added research-backed insights on high-sustainability businesses and practical ways to demonstrate sustainability through networking actions\n\n#### Marketing Strategy (Incubator #19)\n- **Gap**: Eco-marketing can be a strong differentiator if local consumers value sustainability\n- **Changes**: Expanded from 4Ps to 5Ps (adding Purpose) and positioned sustainability as a differentiation strategy that builds customer trust\n\n#### Organizational Gaps (Incubator #21)\n- **Gap**: Partnerships with NGOs or green experts help, but not a top local priority for all teams\n- **Changes**: Expanded partnerships discussion to include environmental sustainability, green supply chains, and collaboration for resource efficiency\n\n#### Business Plan (Incubator #23)\n- **Gap**: Opportunity to formalize climate risks, triple bottom line, and green investment in a robust plan\n- **Changes**: Added \"Green Advantage\" section linking sustainability to financial incentives and investor appeal, while embedding green principles throughout all plan elements\n\n#### Supply Chain (Incubator #25)\n- **Gap**: Local sourcing, circular logistics, climate-proofing can yield major carbon-footprint cuts\n- **Changes**: Updated activities to include material efficiency and waste reduction, plus added a Business Efficiency Workbook to track sustainability improvements\n\n#### Business Ethics (Incubator #27)\n- **Gap**: TBL and ethical sourcing align naturally with climate responsibility and impact measurement\n- **Changes**: Reframed ethics as \"Living Values That Ignite Business,\" emphasizing authenticity as competitive advantage and adding critical analysis of greenwashing\n\n#### Financing Alternatives (Incubator #29)\n- **Gap**: Green investors/grants can massively shape an eco-focused venture's trajectory\n- **Changes**: Added sections on sustainability-focused funding sources and local green incentives like Iraq Central Bank's Green Loans\n\n#### Risk & Crisis Management (Incubator #30)\n- **Gap**: Scenario planning for climate crises is crucial for long-term resilience\n- **Changes**: Expanded risk categories to include environmental and supply chain resilience, with specific tools for climate risk planning\n\n#### Investment in the Middle East (Incubator #31)\n- **Gap**: Regional climate-energy-water challenges make local green investment highly relevant\n- **Changes**: Added green tech opportunity section and sustainability-linked funding data, positioning efficiency improvements as key investor attractions\n\n### Medium Priority Modules (Priority 2)\n\n#### Prototyping (Incubator #4)\n- **Gap**: Low-impact materials feasible, but feasibility concerns often overshadow sustainability\n- **Changes**: Added resource efficiency and waste minimization principles to the prototyping process, with case studies demonstrating sustainable design thinking\n\n#### Graphic Design & Communications (Incubator #14)\n- **Gap**: Mostly about visuals; can highlight a green narrative or reduce print waste\n- **Changes**: Integrated values-based branding and cost-effective sustainable marketing alternatives like QR codes over printed materials\n\n#### Mindsets (Incubator #32)\n- **Gap**: A general session to nudge founders toward sustainability\n- **Changes**: Integrated values-driven leadership concepts and expanded growth mindset discussion to include resilience for environmental and market uncertainties\n\n### Ignite Program Integration\n\nWe also integrated sustainability principles into key Ignite modules:\n\n#### User Research (Ignite #2)\n- **Changes**: Enhanced interview guides and observation prompts to capture climate-driven user needs that can shape solutions\n\n#### Market Research (Ignite #4)\n- **Changes**: Added frameworks for identifying green markets, competitor sustainability practices, and funding opportunities\n\n#### Creativity and Ideation (Ignite #6)\n- **Changes**: Added green brainstorming prompts and introduced the Business Viability Matrix with efficiency criteria\n\n## Core Principles Throughout\n\nAcross all modules, we've emphasized these key principles:\n\n1. **Business-First Approach**: Sustainability is presented as a strategic business advantage with concrete benefits\n2. **Values-Based Decision Making**: Encouraging entrepreneurs to align their business decisions with sustainable and ethical business practices\n3. **Resilience Planning**: Helping entrepreneurs identify risks and build more adaptable businesses\n4. **Efficiency as Competitive Advantage**: Positioning resource efficiency as a way to reduce costs and increase profitability\n5. **The 3 Ps**: People, Planet, and Profit as complementary rather than competing priorities\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Train facilitators on the updated content and new tools\n2. Gather feedback during initial implementation\n3. Collect case studies from Iraqi businesses successfully implementing efficiency measures\n4. Develop additional local examples of green business models relevant to the Iraqi context\n\n---\n\n*This integration was developed based on the ILO's Green Business Booklet and other resources, tailored specifically for the Iraqi entrepreneurial ecosystem.*\n",
