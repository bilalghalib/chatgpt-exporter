Surface Preparation:**\n\n- **Cleaning:** Thoroughly clean the broken edges of the cup to remove any dirt, grease, or debris. Use a mild detergent and water, then rinse and let the pieces dry completely.\n\n- **Sanding:** Lightly sand the surfaces to be bonded to create a slightly rough texture, enhancing adhesion. After sanding, wipe away any dust with a clean, dry cloth.\n\n**2. Mixing the Epoxy Resin:**\n\n- **Proportioning:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions to mix the resin and hardener in the correct ratio. Accurate measurement is crucial for optimal curing and strength.\n\n- **Blending:** Mix the components thoroughly until the mixture is uniform in color and consistency. Some epoxies have differently colored components that, when properly mixed, form a third color, indicating readiness. citeturn0search2\n\n**3. Application:**\n\n- **Adhesive Use:** Apply a thin, even layer of the mixed epoxy to one of the broken edges using a small brush or applicator. Avoid excessive application to prevent overflow when joining the pieces.\n\n- **Joining:** Press the broken pieces together carefully, ensuring proper alignment. Hold them in place until the epoxy begins to set. For larger or heavier pieces, use clamps or tape to maintain position during curing.\n\n**4. Curing:**\n\n- **Setting Time:** Allow the epoxy to set as per the manufacturer's recommended time. Avoid disturbing the pieces during this period to ensure a strong bond.\n\n- **Full Cure:** Epoxy adhesives typically require several hours to fully cure, with some taking up to 15 hours. Ensure the adhesive is completely cured before using the cup.\n\n**5. Post-Curing:**\n\n- **Cleaning Excess:** Once cured, remove any excess epoxy carefully with a sharp blade or fine sandpaper.\n\n- **Safety Check:** Verify that the epoxy used is certified food-safe and that the repair is smooth, with no residual adhesive that could come into contact with food or beverages.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n- **Food Safety:** Ensure the epoxy resin is certified as food-safe under relevant regulations, such as the European Framework Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004.\n\n- **Application Method:** For vertical surfaces, consider using a thickened epoxy adhesive or gel formulation to prevent sagging. Alternatively, allow the mixed epoxy to sit briefly to thicken before application.\n\n- **Temperature and Humidity:** Conduct the repair in a controlled environment, as temperature and humidity can affect curing times and bond strength.\n\nBy meticulously following these steps and considerations, you can effectively use epoxy resin as an adhesive to repair your cup, ensuring it is safe for future use. ",
