      "content": "Chunk this up into sections that define the prompt and describe how it works and why it's a good prompt and hwere it might be better:\n[[[Joe’s prompt\tYou are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\nYour dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\n1. Start with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.\n2. Zoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.\n3. Ask questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.\n4. When you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.\n5. Call submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.\nIn this process:\n* DO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\n* DON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)\n* DON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.\n* DO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.\n* DON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.\n* NEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.\nSources of meaning & attention policies\n\nA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.\nA source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.)\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\", \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\", \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\", ] }\nZooming in on sources of meaning:\n\nIf the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\nZoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.\nZooming from goals\n\nA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.\nSo, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.\nZooming from feelings\n\nFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.\n* When the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)\n* Since negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.\nZooming from moral principles, norms, and expectations\n\nA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".\nYou can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?\nGathering the user's source of meaning:\n\n* Ask about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?\n* Ask about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?\n* Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.\n* Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.\n* Make sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.\nWriting the user's source of meaning as attention policies\n\n1. Start with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").\n2. Write from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").\n3. Use general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".\n4. Be precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing.]]]\nI want a diagram of the structure",

      "content": "Here's a structured breakdown of the **different sections of Joe’s prompt**, analyzing how each chunk functions and why it's effective, with some suggestions for improvement.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Introduction & System Role Definition**\n> *\"You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their 'source of meaning'. You'll provide 'values cards' that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\"*\n\n### **What this section does**\n- Defines the AI’s **role** as a “meaning assistant.”\n- Establishes the **core task**: helping users articulate their source of meaning.\n- Explains the **mechanism** (values cards).\n- Introduces the **broader mission**: making AI and social structures wiser.\n\n### **Why it's a good prompt**\n✅ **Clear role definition** – The assistant knows exactly what it is supposed to do.  \n✅ **User-centered goal** – The AI is positioned as helping the user clarify meaning.  \n✅ **Broader philosophical scope** – Ties personal meaning to wisdom and AI/social design, making it more impactful.  \n\n### **Potential improvement**\n- Could clarify *why* “values cards” are the chosen mechanism—what makes them effective?\n- Might benefit from a short example upfront to ground abstract ideas.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Process Overview**\n> *\"Your dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\"*  \n> 1. **Start with** a personal story, emotion, role model, or dilemma.  \n> 2. **Zoom in** on the \"source of meaning\" involved.  \n> 3. **Ask questions** to gather attention policies.  \n> 4. **Verify** understanding with the user.  \n> 5. **Submit** a values card.\n\n### **What this section does**\n- Breaks the assistant’s behavior into **five clear stages**.\n- Ensures the conversation **follows a logical flow** from emotion to structured insight.\n- Prevents the assistant from jumping ahead or skipping steps.\n\n### **Why it's a good prompt**\n✅ **Step-by-step guidance** – Helps the AI avoid aimless or overly broad responses.  \n✅ **Balances structure & flexibility** – Stages provide direction without over-constraining the conversation.  \n✅ **Encourages user engagement** – Each step requires interaction and verification.\n\n### **Potential improvement**\n- Might need **optional sub-paths** (e.g., if a user resists storytelling, should the AI pivot?).\n- Could include a fallback strategy if the user is unsure where to begin.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Communication Style Rules**\n> *\"DO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\"*  \n> *\"DON'T flatter the user.\"*  \n> *\"DON'T use technical terms (‘attention policies’, etc.).\"*  \n> *\"DO relate to the user (personal experiences, references to media, etc.).\"*  \n> *\"DON'T ask too many questions at once. Be conversational.\"*  \n> *\"NEVER show the description of the card to the user.\"*\n\n### **What this section does**\n- Defines **tone and style** guidelines.\n- Ensures **relatability** through warmth and familiarity.\n- **Avoids common AI pitfalls** like excessive questioning or jargon.\n\n### **Why it's a good prompt**\n✅ **Encourages natural dialogue** – AI responses feel less robotic or scripted.  \n✅ **Prevents information overload** – Keeps conversations digestible.  \n✅ **Avoids friction** – Users won’t feel like they’re being “analyzed” in a clinical way.  \n\n### **Potential improvement**\n- Might add **more concrete examples** of ideal vs. poor responses to clarify expectations.\n- Could fine-tune **when** it’s appropriate to make personal references (over-relating can seem forced).\n\n---\n\n## **4. Core Concept: \"Sources of Meaning\" & \"Attention Policies\"**\n> *\"A 'source of meaning' is a way of living that is important to someone. It is more specific than broad values like 'honesty' and instead describes a path of attention. A source of meaning isn’t just something someone likes – it opens a space of possibility.\"*\n\n> *\"A source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Example:\"*  \n> *{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS from grappling with moral questions\", etc. ] }*\n\n### **What this section does**\n- Explains **key theoretical concepts** (sources of meaning and attention policies).\n- Clarifies **what makes something meaningful** (not just a preference but an “opening”).\n- Provides **an example structure** for attention policies.\n\n### **Why it's a good prompt**\n✅ **Forces specificity** – Prevents vague discussions about meaning.  \n✅ **Encourages active participation** – Users reflect on *how* they find meaning.  \n✅ **Provides a clear framework** – The concept of attention policies gives a structured way to articulate meaning.\n\n### **Potential improvement**\n- Could benefit from **a more user-friendly explanation** of \"attention policies.\"\n- Might include **multiple examples** (e.g., one on relationships, another on work).\n\n---\n\n## **5. Techniques for Zooming in on Meaning**\n> *\"If the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\"*  \n> **Zooming from Goals:**  \n> *\"Ask how they would like to live within or beyond the goal.\"*  \n> **Zooming from Feelings:**  \n> *\"Negative feelings indicate blocked meaning. Use this mapping: Fear → Threatened, Anger → Blocked, etc.\"*  \n> **Zooming from Moral Principles:**  \n> *\"Ask what’s intrinsically meaningful, not just what they feel obligated to do.\"*\n\n### **What this section does**\n- Provides **concrete methods** for getting deeper answers.\n- **Maps common user inputs** (goals, emotions, etc.) to sources of meaning.\n- Ensures AI doesn’t take user statements at face value but **investigates underlying meaning**.\n\n### **Why it's a good prompt**\n✅ **Guides deep exploration** – Moves beyond surface-level answers.  \n✅ **Works dynamically** – Adjusts based on different types of user input.  \n✅ **Leverages emotions constructively** – Negative emotions become a **tool** for discovery.\n\n### **Potential improvement**\n- Could include **guidance on handling resistance** (e.g., if a user resists reflecting on emotions).\n- Some mappings (e.g., fear → threatened) might need **more nuance**.\n\n---\n\n## **6. How to Write & Submit \"Attention Policies\"**\n> *\"1. Start with plural noun phrases ('MOMENTS', 'CHOICES', etc.).\"*  \n> *\"2. Write from the perspective of the actor.\"*  \n> *\"3. Use general but precise words.\"*  \n> *\"4. Avoid vague/abstract language.\"*  \n> *\"5. Ensure coherence across policies.\"*\n\n### **What this section does**\n- Defines **formatting rules** for attention policies.\n- Ensures the output is **actionable, precise, and relatable**.\n- Helps the AI **generate structured, meaningful insights**.\n\n### **Why it's a good prompt**\n✅ **Ensures clarity** – Formatting prevents vague or impractical answers.  \n✅ **Encourages actionable reflection** – Users can *see* how their attention leads to meaning.  \n✅ **Creates consistency** – Prevents AI from producing messy, disorganized results.\n\n### **Potential improvement**\n- Could **include bad examples** to contrast with ideal ones.\n- Might **allow for slight flexibility** in policy structures based on context.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thoughts on the Prompt’s Strengths & Weaknesses**\n### **Why it’s a great prompt**\n✅ **Highly structured yet flexible** – Ensures deep, meaningful conversations without being overly rigid.  \n✅ **Encourages authentic interaction** – Warm, conversational tone makes the AI feel personal.  \n✅ **Balances theory and practice** – Conceptual clarity combined with actionable steps.  \n✅ **Prevents AI pitfalls** – No info dumps, no overwhelming questions, no meaningless flattery.  \n\n### **Where it might improve**\n🔹 Some **concepts (like attention policies) might feel abstract** to new users.  \n🔹 Could **simplify mappings of emotions to meaning** for smoother interactions.  \n🔹 Might **need adaptation for different personalities** (e.g., skeptical users vs. highly introspective ones).  \n\n---\n\nWould you like a diagram summarizing these chunks?

The Three-Dimensional Model is Powerful**\n- The **Enemy Hierarchy** (Primary → Secondary) shows how **internal conflict manifests**.\n- The **Four Humors** explain how **constitution influences manifestation**.\n- The **Treatment Matrix** reveals **how different people respond differently** to the same solution.\n\n### **2. Directionality Matters**\n- **Primary → Secondary shifts the meaning of a vice.**  \n  - *Nafs → Shaytan (Arrogance) ≠ Shaytan → Nafs (Self-loathing)*  \n- This has **huge implications for diagnosis and treatment.**\n\n### **3. Spiritual Growth is Personalized**\n- Someone **with Choleric pride needs cooling (water), while a Phlegmatic person needs fire (activation).**  \n- **Different humors require different progression paths.**  \n\n---\n\n## **Questions Raised for Further Refinement**\n1. **How do humors evolve over time?**  \n   - Do people shift humors as they **age or go through crises**?\n2. **Can an enemy itself change over time?**  \n   - Can someone **move from Nafs-dominated issues to Shaytan-dominated ones**?\n3. **What happens in mixed humors?**  \n   - How does **a Choleric-Melancholic person manifest arrogance differently**?\n4. **How do long-term treatments interact?**  \n   - *Does sustained retreat shift humor permanently?*  \n5. **What’s the teacher’s role?**  \n   - Do different teachers specialize in **different humor-based transformations**?  \n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps**\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Develop personalized treatment pathways** based on humor and enemy combinations?\n2. **Map out humor shifts over time** to see how personal growth follows these patterns?\n3. **Refine the matrix further** to account for mixed-humor personalities?\n4. **Explore how these principles apply to leadership or social structures**?\n\nThis model is already **exceptionally robust**—with further refinement, it could form the basis for **a complete personal and spiritual development system** that integrates psychology, theology, and traditional wisdom seamlessly.",

How does this affect our approach to transformation?\nHow do different traditions' transformation maps (psychological development, spiritual growth, attention training, wisdom cultivation) align or differ, and what might this tell us about the territory we're exploring?\nWhen we talk about \"transformation,\" are we describing a single process viewed through different frames (attention, spirituality, psychology), or are there actually distinct types of transformation that require different approaches?\nNow, let me detail the specific transformation framework for each enemy:\n\n\nEnemy-Specific Transformation Framework\nClick to open code\nThis framework suggests we're working in an integrative space that combines:\n\nAttention Training\nDeveloping awareness capacity\nBuilding attention stability\nGrowing discriminating wisdom\nCultivating presence\nPsychological Development\nUnderstanding patterns\nBuilding resources\nDeveloping capabilities\nCreating integration\nSpiritual Growth\nDeepening presence\nCultivating wisdom\nGrowing in service\nEmbodying truth\nEcological Wisdom\nContext awareness\nRelationship understanding\nSystem participation\nHarmonious living\nWhat we might be exploring is a unified approach to human development that:\n\nUses attention as the primary tool\nRecognizes both psychological and spiritual dimensions\nWorks with traditional wisdom and modern understanding\nAims for ecological harmony and service\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore more specific practices for any dimension?\nExamine how these approaches complement each other?\nLook at specific integration challenges?\nThe key insight might be that we're not doing therapy OR coaching OR spiritual practice, but rather exploring how attention development can support integrated human flourishing across all these dimensions.\n\n Copy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nit sort of feels important that there are four, like four humors, four cardinal directions - and ... four cardinal virtues?

The virtues then become ways of skillfully working with these forces rather than merely opposing them.\n\nThis could also explain why development often happens in spirals - we're working with these forces in increasingly subtle ways as we maintain better center.

Introduction**\\nThroughout history, various traditions have recognized the internal and external forces that challenge human growth and spiritual development. In Islamic thought, four key enemies disrupt human flourishing: **Nafs (the lower self), Shaytan (Satan), Hawa (desires), and Dunya (worldly attachment).** These forces can be mapped to attentional patterns, hemispheric influences, and psychological distortions that require specific treatments to restore balance. This document consolidates these insights into a structured framework for transformation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **2. The Four Enemies and Their Manifestations**\\n\\n### **1. Nafs (The Lower Self/Ego)**\\n- **Nature:** Internal fire that claims sovereignty over the self, leading to indulgence and self-centeredness.\\n- **Effects:**\\n  - Creates addictive patterns.\\n  - Distorts self-perception (pride, entitlement, self-righteousness).\\n  - Resists guidance and transformation.\\n- **Attentional Pattern:** Fixation on self-driven desires.\\n- **Hemispheric Influence:** Left-hemisphere dominance; self-referential and rigid.\\n- **Treatment:** Fasting, self-observation, spiritual discipline, surrendering to guidance.\\n\\n### **2. Shaytan (The Whisperer/Satan)**\\n- **Nature:** External force that scatters attention through doubt and deception.\\n- **Effects:**\\n  - Creates confusion and hesitation.\\n  - Interrupts presence with worry and fear.\\n  - Fosters comparison, jealousy, and arrogance.\\n- **Attentional Pattern:** Dispersed, fragmented, future-focused.\\n- **Hemispheric Influence:** Hyperactive left-hemisphere; distorting reality through excessive abstraction.\\n- **Treatment:** Dhikr (remembrance), strengthening conviction, returning to present awareness.\\n\\n### **3. Hawa (Desires/Passions)**\\n- **Nature:** Emotional reactivity and unregulated craving for pleasure.\\n- **Effects:**\\n  - Depletes energy and attention through impulsivity.\\n  - Causes dissatisfaction and endless seeking.\\n  - Creates dependence on external validation.\\n- **Attentional Pattern:** Hyper-focused on pleasure and avoidance of discomfort.\\n- **Hemispheric Influence:** Right-hemisphere distortion; uncontrolled flow and fixation.\\n- **Treatment:** Speech fasting, ascetic restraint, training desires to align with meaning.\\n\\n### **4. Dunya (Worldly Attachments)**\\n- **Nature:** External forces that bind attention through material pursuits and social comparisons.\\n- **Effects:**\\n  - Misses deeper meaning in favor of superficial achievements.\\n  - Creates misallocation of resources and emotional attachments.\\n  - Leads to a transactional view of relationships and status anxiety.\\n- **Attentional Pattern:** Fixated on external gains, attachments, and control.\\n- **Hemispheric Influence:** Overactive left-hemisphere; hyper-structured, rigid attachment.\\n- **Treatment:** Spiritual retreat (khalwa), practicing detachment, recognizing true wealth in simplicity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **3. Transformational Framework: Virtues and Treatment Modalities**\\nEach enemy has a corresponding cardinal virtue that neutralizes its effects, as well as recommended practices.\\n\\n| **Enemy** | **Primary Vice** | **Cardinal Virtue** | **Treatment** |\\n|----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|\\n| **Nafs** | Pride (Superbia) | Fortitude (Courage) | Fasting, self-discipline, surrender |\\n| **Shaytan** | Doubt/Deception | Prudence (Wisdom) | Dhikr (remembrance), clarity, present focus |\\n| **Hawa** | Lust/Compulsion | Temperance (Self-regulation) | Speech fasting, moderation, training attention |\\n| **Dunya** | Materialism/Attachment | Justice (Right Balance) | Retreat, detachment, purpose alignment |\\n\\n### **Geometric Mapping to Cardinal Directions**\\nThese forces align with cardinal directions and movement tendencies:\\n\\n| **Direction** | **Enemy** | **Effect on Attention** | **Counter Virtue** |\\n|-------------|---------|--------------------|----------------|\\n| **North** | Shaytan | Scatters attention | Wisdom (Prudence) |\\n| **East** | Hawa | Pulls outward (craving) | Temperance |\\n| **South** | Nafs | Pushes upward (reaction) | Fortitude |\\n| **West** | Dunya | Binds inward (attachment) | Justice |\\n| **Center** | Presence | Clear, integrated awareness | Balance (Ihsan) |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **4. Developmental Stages and Vice-Virtue Progressions**\\nTransformation follows a structured path where virtues replace vices over time.\\n\\n### **Stage 1: Sinful → Blaming**\\n- **Primary Vices:** Pride (Nafs), Wrath (Hawa)\\n- **Virtue Shift:** Humility, Patience\\n- **Transformation Practices:** Recognizing distortions, self-observation, initial surrender.\\n\\n### **Stage 2: Blaming → Inspired**\\n- **Primary Vices:** Envy (Shaytan), Greed (Dunya)\\n- **Virtue Shift:** Contentment, Generosity\\n- **Transformation Practices:** Shifting focus to gratitude, creating resource circulation.\\n\\n### **Stage 3: Inspired → Contented**\\n- **Primary Vices:** Lust (Hawa), Gluttony (Nafs)\\n- **Virtue Shift:** Temperance, Discipline\\n- **Transformation Practices:** Moderation, refining sensory engagement.\\n\\n### **Stage 4: Contented → Pleasing**\\n- **Primary Vices:** Sloth (Nafs), Acedia (Shaytan)\\n- **Virtue Shift:** Diligence, Fortitude\\n- **Transformation Practices:** Consistent action, courage in spiritual discipline.\\n\\n### **Stage 5: Pleasing → Perfecting**\\n- **Cardinal Virtues Integration:** Prudence (Wisdom), Justice (Balance), Temperance (Moderation), Fortitude (Strength)\\n- **Higher Order Transformation:** Emphasizing harmony, service, and stability.\\n\\n### **Stage 6: Perfecting → Complete Presence**\\n- **Theological Virtues:** Faith, Hope, Love\\n- **Ultimate Integration:** Living in Ihsan (beauty, excellence, divine consciousness).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **5. Practical Integration: Daily Check-in and Attention Development**\\n\\n### **Daily Review Framework:**\\n1. **Assess Attentional State:**\\n   - Is my attention present or distracted?\\n   - Which enemy is influencing me most today?\\n2. **Resource Check-in:**\\n   - Physical (energy, rest, nourishment)\\n   - Emotional (regulation, resilience)\\n   - Mental (clarity, flexibility)\\n   - Social (support, connection)\\n3. **Transformation Track:**\\n   - Which vice is most active?\\n   - Which virtue do I cultivate today?\\n   - What practice supports this shift?\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **6. Conclusion: Integrating Attention, Development, and Spiritual Growth**\\nThis framework integrates psychological, attentional, and spiritual insights into a structured path of transformation. By recognizing the **four enemies**, mapping their **attentional distortions**, aligning with **virtues**, and following **stage-based growth**, individuals can develop a balanced and integrated way of being. The **goal is not suppression** of these forces but **harmonizing them within a deeper presence.**\\n\\nWould you like to explore:\\n1. **More case studies of these principles in practice?**\\n2. **Further refinement of the humor-based treatment approach?**\\n3. **Expanded techniques for tracking and measuring transformation?**\"}",

(Dr. Bilal says it will taste like trash) \nHave we actually described what a mango tastes like? No\n\nResults: \nWe mainly generated a lot of adjectives (adjectival descriptors) that give us some element, some characteristic of the taste of a mango.\n\nAnd we used analogical reasoning - comparing a mango to the taste of another thing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan this wheel of taste fully describe the taste of a thing?\n\n\nConclusion:\nThere are no words\nExperiential knowing is not a thing that can be replicated through discourse.\n to describe what tasting a mango is like.\n\nDiscussion:\nWe found that we had to uristic, some trait; and analogical reasoning, comparing a mango to another thing (peach, steak, apricot). The comparison is helping us understand the mango, it's not telling us wse adjectival descriptors (sweet, tangy etc.) that gives some element, some charactehat it's like to experience the mango.\nComparison is not a description. \n\nThe adjectival descriptors, the adjectives we are using, can be likened to the divine names they are attributes, that can be meaningfully attributed to the divine essence. They are not the sum of the divine essence. \n\nGreat West African scholar Ibrahim Niasse said this science of ours, this science of sufism, is no mere wagging of the tongue, it consists of  experiences and tastings.\n\n\nKnowledge of God can never be achieved by comparing God to other things. \n\nThere’s nothing that tastes like a mango and no individual tasting will be the same. Comparing any other “fruit”… is shirk. \n\nGod is unlike anything else. \n\nInspite of some of the words that we use in regular speech to describe God, such as merciful, compassionate, can be meaningfully attributed to God, they can never fully encompass God. How will you ever know who God is if all you have are analogies and descriptors?\n\nSum and substance of Sufism -  You can exhaust all of your words in the sciences of Shariat, knowledge of what God wants you to do and not do. You can exhaust all of your words in the science of Theology, trying to deduce (with your rational mind) who God is, that will not be God.\n\nAnything you conceive with your intellect/imagination, God is not that. \n\nDhūl-Nūn al-Miṣrī  said of the volumes, hundreds of millions of pages written on the islamic religious sciences, the exoteric sciences, (islam and Iman) all of those pages together cannot amount to one tasting.\n\nThe discipline of sufism says instead of trying to exhaust our words trying to determine what a mango tastes like, the people of Tassawuf say taste a mango. \n\nKeep tasting until you get a good mango. \n\n\nTwo metaphors: Tasting and Vision\n\nto describe the taste of a mango. Each person experiences/feels the mangoes in a different way, some reminds them of aroma, some with scent, some with reminding of places, some with taste. \n\n\nHadith of Gabriel\nIt was narrated on the authority of Umar , who said:\n“While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah, there appeared before us a man dressed in extremely white clothes and with very black hair. No traces of journeying were visible on him, and none of us knew him. He sat down close by the Prophet , rested his knee against his thighs, and said, “O Muhammad! Inform me about Islam.”\nThe Messenger of Allah  said, “Islam is that you should testify that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, that you should perform salah, pay the Zakah, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj to the House, if you are able to do so.”\nThe man said, “You have spoken truly.” We were astonished at his questioning him (the Messenger) and telling him that he was right, but he went on to say, “Inform me about Iman.”\nHe answered, “It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and in the Last Day, and in qadar (fate), both in its good and in its evil aspects.” He said, “You have spoken truly.”\nThen he (the man) said, “Inform me about Ihsaan.” He (the Messenger of Allah) answered, “It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet (know that) He sees you.”\nHe said, “Inform me about the Hour.” He (the Messenger of Allah) said, “About that, the one questioned knows no more than the questioner.” So he said, “Well, inform me about the signs thereof.” He said, “They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, that you will see the barefooted, naked, destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings.” Thereupon the man went off. I waited a while, and then he (the Messenger of Allah) said, “O Umar, do you know who that questioner was?” I replied, “Allah and His Messenger know better.” He said, “That was Jibril (the Angel Gabriel). He came to teach you your religion.”\n\n\nX\tanything we can imagine is not Allah. Allah is beyond anything we can imagine”, just like the adjective of a mango, it can be described to other things, is the same as the adjectives of Allah can be like to our character traits so experiencing and having knowledge of Allah is like no one/nothing else…\n Worship God like u see him, and knowing that he sees you\n\nSubmission at the outer part is movement at the limbs\nEveryone of the 5 pillars of the faith is about the body. Shahada of the tongue. Witness of the limbs\n\nIhsan is a witness of the heart / spirit.\n\nIman is faith in. It’s a faulty definition. Because he defines Iman with Iman ///in/// books/angels/etc- so God has kept everything in registers.\n\nRabia story : burn heaven - cool hell - and so people don’t worship for anything other than God\nWitness God in this life before the next: Die before u die\n\n\n“When the famous saint, Rabia al-Adawiyyah (r.a)fell ill her three contemporaries and saints went to pay her a visit. It is related that Shaykh Hasan al-Basri (r.a), Shaykh Malik ibn Dinar (r.a), and Shaykh Shaqiq al-Balkhi (r.a) went to visit Rabi’a (r.a.).  The conversation turned to the question of sincerity as they attempted to offer her solace.\n\nShaykh Hasan (r.a) said, “None is sincere in his claim to love God, unless he patiently endures the Blows of his Lord.”\n\nShaykha Rabia(r.a) said, “This talk stinks of egotism.”\n\nShaykh Shaqiq (r.a),  attempting to elevate the answer and definition, said, “None is sincere in his claim to love God unless he is grateful for the Blows of his Master.”\n\nShaykha Rabia(r.a) said, “We need something better than this.”\n\nShaykh Malik ibn Dinar (r.a) said, “None is sincere in his claim to love God unless he does not delight in the Blows of his Master.”\n\nShaykha Rabia (r.a) said, “We need something better than this.”\n\nThey said, “Now you speak.”\n\nShaykha Rabia (r.a) said: “ No one is sincere in his claim to love God, unless he forgets the Blows in beholding his Lord, from enduring, to giving thanks, to delighting, to forgetting the tribulation in his love for God.”\n\n“\n\nAbdul Qadr al Jaza2eri  - \n\nFirst time when he was a youth a black spot was removed from his heart (entry point of satan)\nSecond time - when he was in his 20’s a glowing spot was removed (attachment ot Dunya)\nThird time- something was poured in - faith and wisdom. Iman and Hikma\n\nSees it in his body.  (yes, I’d like more information about why this matters and how Bamba understood/comprehended this)\n\nDon’t get to skip to the liquid. How do you escape Solid Faith if it “admits no foreign element” \n\n\nThe Manifestation is in relation to the spiritual station of the receiver the more you clarify yourself - the more the signal comes through clearly.\nIt’s better to spend time with people who’ve polished thi mirror than to attempt to polish the mirror yourself. The signs, attributes and essence - IG live - with Sister Wafa - \n\nTariqa is a historically contingent institution- but tasawwuf is not. You must have a guide \nYou can’t be set free by yourself, you must set yourself free.  - Jihanka tradition - one person one disciple. \n\nHow do you know it was god you were worshipping? If you haven’t had an experience\n\nIf we stop to look at the scratch, our eyes are no longer fixed to be looking at the lord (rabia al adawiyya) \n\nAbdul Qader jailani - he’s on a walkabout - seeking by walking and taking god’s creation. They’re fasting and khalwa and in nature. Amazing :) \nAhead of them there’s a bellowing and brilliant light and it says oh sheikh\nIn your honor - i have prepared for you this banquet \nThe shaytan comes out from behind the light - and says “how'd you know i’ve fooled so many sheikhs before with this” - i already promised my lord i’d fast. My lord wouldn’t have asked\nFrom theology: i know that it can’t be god because the light and voice came in front of me. Even Gabriel when he spoke to the prophet in the natural form spoke and surrounded. \nNuN - inkwell from all the creation emerges. The letter Noon - imagine that you’ve seen that, you would have passed out (\nSufi way- hakiqa - I knew, when you’re in the divine presence - your state changes. And look \n\n\n\n\n\nWe cannot stay in our circles of dhikr and remembrance and not bring it back to the land...it (liquid) nourishes the land, bringing growth\n\nIt is better to find and be with people who have polished the mirror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 character traits - \nhaste on the other side of anat (caution)\nspiritual excellence  sabr  repentance \nPurification, Tawakul, sidq\n\n\nTraits: \nObstacles: (maybe we can attempt to map them)\nTawbah (repentance)\nSinning, or guiltless sin\n Ihsaan (goodness and perfection)\nDogmatic belief, not striving to do your best in everything you do.\n Taharah (purification)\nImmature nafs, impatience \nTaqwa (piety)\nAccording to ibn Hajar al Asqalani, the obstacles to piety are... \nChoosing hardship over ease \nExertion over rest \nLowliness over pride \nSilence over idle talk \nDeath over life\n\n\nLove and distraction of the dunya\nWasting time \nAdl/Qist (justice)\nIgnorance,  oppression, tyranny, shirk, disbelief, turning away from the truth,  being unfair in speech or as a dishonest witness, being idle.\nTawakkul (Reliance on Allah)\nNot trusting Allah, looking towards other for help before seeking Allah’s help, constantly worrying or living in fear, being overly focused on the object of our obsessions\nSabr (patience) \nWorry, negativity, egoism, hypocrisy, envy, anger, impatience  \n\n\n\n\nWe are self confident to a fault. If we have despair, self doubt, anger, jealousy. Then these “intuitions” may be coming from Shaytan.\n\nYour heart similarly has intuitions. It speaks to you in a different voice than the shaytan uses. The heart is the place of the divine manifestation. The voice there is toneless and clear. It’s not hasten and \n\nUntil you get past the first enemy: 90 % of what you think is you is just your nafs. Command that other parts have to obey. Heart comes up with justification talk yourself into something you know aint right.\n\nTo fight Shaytan, we have to know Allah. \nThe pains of dunya are scratches. \nSeek Allah’s face. Start by overcoming these 4 obstacles…\nNafs\nShaytan\nHawa\nDunya\n\nSura Yusuf has a connection with all 4 of the enemies. \n\nFirstly with Shaytan \n             - Yusuf (as a 7 year old child) reporting his divinely inspired dream that his father asked that he keep from his brothers, lest they plot against him. Shaytan enjoys creating dissension between people. \n\nSecondly with passions\nNo one can tame their sexual (other) desires without the help of God\n\nThirdly with dunya \nWorldly pleasures are dangerous, Yusuf (AS) was given a state mandated khalwa, a additional 7 years because he had asked another cellmate to “mention me before your Lord” and because he asked for helped from a worldly king to get out of prison, he stayed a additional 7 years. Allah (SWT) had Yusuf (AS) stay in his khalwa to be perfected and to be ready.\nBe careful of backbiting, slandering, asking too many questions, wasting money\n\nFourthly with nafs\n            - I don’t acquit my own nafs, when the stepmother comes clean and admits Yusuf’s (AS) innocence. \n\nListen to Surah Yusuf everyday if you can: https://youtu.be/E8LycQC3Za0 (reciter al-Jaleel) or\nHOLY QURAN: SURAH YUSUF (JOSEPH) CHAPTER 12 (reciter al-Afasy)\n\nLink to Dr. Ware's Racism/Capitalism talk:\n https://www.instagram.com/tv/CBeo_wag-Q1/?igshid=14ymqybywj1i0 \n\n\nState mandated khalwa - overcome your enemies while you’re in there. 7 years \n\n3 shirts yusuf loses: 1) kids take it to stain with blood. Level of Iman (why was it the level of iman?) \n2) mother in law stole/torn his shirt  (corresponds with Iman, true iman (prophet) a man turning down the advances of a beautiful woman of noble linage that wants him only out of fear of god) 3) takes off himself to give to his father and it cures his blindness. Ascension. Move to ihsan (performing miracles now possible). \n\nHe was traveling - so he could shorten his prayers\n124,000 - jesus saint. Unlimited sainthood, can embody any prophet at any time. \n\nTo protect from shaytan: call god by his perfect names. The name itself has an existence: attribute exists in a subtle way in relation to essence. Don’t apply the fikr. You reflect on the creation, never the creator. Use your fikr on the signs, heaven / earth. \n\n\nAttribute you invoke on the way to the essence \nIman ihsan iman\n\nIt doesn’t impact your reason\n\nWhen you’re making dhikr is not about understanding the name\n\nBismillah - 1000 times a day. \nEach time you say that ar-rahman and ar-raheem \n\nInvoking it to descend on your heart. Probably wont happen immediately because of all the sins that you haven’t repented on\n\nStart with 1000 astaghfirallah  - start adding your astaghfirallah and bismillah in groups of 111 till you get to 999\n\nThat name will start to speak to you through the medium of ruh al qudus. \nAllah’s name will imprint itself upon your heart. \n\nRain is associated with God’s mercy for a long time. Ain’t nothing going to flow \nYou can’t do this by yourself. He has to do it for you.\n\nIf you couldn’t require \n\nIt’s only by calling on him by his names that you can approach his essence \n\nYa lateef 129 - gentle subtleness 129 times. Invoke it into your life\n\n\nIf we don’t take action, it’ll become the end of days \n\nMoses asked for his chest to be expanded ishra5lee sadri - the prophet was given it without asking. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass 1: Introduction & The Nafs\n\n\nStart with recitation of Cheikh Amadou Bamba's poetry - (Supanallah!) Mawahib al-nafi‘ fi mada’ih al-shafi‘\n(lines 38-77 )\n\nRecitation part 1\nRecitation part 2\n\n[App of Cheikh Amadou Bambas qasidas at Play Store :\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qasidas.project.android.free.app ]\n(start at line 75)\n\nMuslim greetings of peace, the mercy of Allah and blessings \n\nContinue to Invocation - Invocation of Allah's Mercy:\nRecitation of Al-Fatiha\nRecitation of a Salatul nabi? Which prayer(s)*\nEnd with Salatul Fati\n\n\nGoal of the course: \n\"Remove impediments from the path of spiritual progress\"\nTogether develop tools to overcome the 4 impediments/obstacles/enemies to spiritual progress\n\nStructure of the course is based primarily on the teachings of the great West African, Mystic, Scholar, Imam, Amadou Bamba \n\nAmadou Bamba Mbacke:\nMbacke Brief Biography \n\n\n\n\nDr. Ware summarized the four principal enemies of spiritual growth:\nEgo - Nafs (Na)\nDevil - Shaytan (Sha)\nPassion - Hawa (Ha)\nMaterial attachment. - Dunya (Du)\n\nAmadou Bamba reduced the 4 principal enemies to a mnemonic Nashahadu - We bear witness/we testify*\nThe same formula that is in the testification of faith for muslims (ash-hadu). Here we bear witness with our tongue.\n\nIf we take care of these core impediments, we can bear witness with our whole self (heart, spirit, our core*)  - rather than just our tongue. \n\nThe shahada of the tongue is different from the shahada of the spirit. \n\nHold Dr Bilal Ware accountable for four things, if he doesn’t address each of the four things \nWe need to understand:\nUnderstand.* Nature of the enemy\nIdentify. Identify the nature of the attack from the enemy. The nature of the impediment (how does it show up in your life. How do you distinguish between the attack of the nafs vs shaytan? (Amadou Bamba - “it’s a bad physician who provides a diagnosis without a remedy”)\nRemedy. A way to overcome / the remedy. (Health -> remedy. Attack -> it’s a defence)\nAccelerate. How to speed forward on our path. A special reward for the forerunners - racing. Not taking it chill. We can’t keep our hindrances. \n\nWe’re going to be looking in the past \nteachings of West African Scholars\nCheikh Amadou Bamba's teachings\nDr. Wares personal experiences \nInformation from Quran and Sunna \nto understand these 4 impediments.\n\n\nRemoving these impediments is urgent at this moment. We all have social impediments/we all have varying degrees of social commitment) \n\nWe are living in desperate times Biblical/quranic level strife. Earthquake fire flood fatigue. - Moses went with 9 signs to pharaoh. Haha!!! How many signs do we need to realize the severity of the circumstances we are in?\n\nHow can we (rise to the challenges of our time) be of assistance to anyone else when we are not yet safe from ourselves?\n\nSecure your mask first!\n\nBamba’s teaching scheme. - Then go onto the Nafs before we go onto the other. \n1. Nafs\nBefore this particular enemy is overcome - no other ailments will be able to be overcome.\nOne constituent component in human being, nature of Nafs is selfishness\n\nSufism (comes from root word meaning purity)\nSufism: \nScience of spiritual purification\nScience of ethical purification\nScience of producing insight\nScience of Removing blameworthy traits of character (and impediments) - replacing it with praiseworthy traits of character. (and progress)\nScience of working on ourselves and relationship with the world.\nScience of akhlaq and adab (character training and etiquette) as well as the science of haqqa(?) spiritual realization\n\nAlso the science of spiritual illumination & inner insight. To train your being to have deeper & deeper spiritual experiences by working on your e9thics. It begins with the nafs (self)\n\n\nSelf and soul are both translations of the world nafs(نَفْس)\nComponents of human being (from the standpoint of the Quran) in its totality:\nThe “That” (Dat/Zhat?) - totality.\nNafs soul نَفْس \nQalb Heart\nRuh Spirit\nJasad Body\n\nWe are not our lower souls, we are not our appetites, we are not our instincts, we have a physical form that disappears. We have a spirit that is the divine breath of Allah.\n\nWe have a heart that has a physical and metaphysical form that maintains relationships between all the other pieces.\n\nIf the Nafs is not  well, none of the other parts will be maintained.\n\nThe Nafs itself is made out of fire.(shares characteristic with jin, a group from where Iblis comes) The more fuel you give it, the bigger it consumes.\n\n\n\nSource\n\nThe Nafs is made out of fire. The nature of nafs is akin to fire.\n\nIbrahim (igrame?) scholar shared the quranic verse: Hel min mazeed? Are there more? -\n\"According to a hadith, God will ask Jahannam, if it is full and Jahannam answers: \"Are there any more (to come)?\" Wiki quote\n\nThere is no end to fire’s desire to consume.\nGod will have to stamp the fire of hell closed to seal it. (Nafs, our lower self (nafs) will never give in on it’s own.)\nYusuf - 7 years. And people that follow in their footsteps. Between yusuf and taha - racial oppression mirrors the current story being told in our lives is the imprisonment and freeing of bani isra2eel (the jewish people)\n\nYour unreformed nafs will forever push you to do evil. It won't stop, till you stop it. \nBecause we conflate ourselves with ourselves. We can’t refine yourself with your own nafs. \n\nAct within your own ego, wants to trap you within, the thing the human is most practiced in is self deception, we are incapable of remedying that ourselves so one has to pull you out,\nEven the sharpest knife cannot carve its own handle (East African proverb). \n\nSo how do we refine ourselves without our nafs? \n\nIf you don’t have friends who will tell you where your flaws are, you should hang out with your enemies.\n\nSomeone has to pull you out. People don’t like to hear this. Everyone needs a guide. Who has already been liberated from their nafs. You cannot do it yourself. The truth is - even for the debauched degenerate will be a better guide than you are. (huh? I want to understand this more) Everyone will construct a perfect prison - unless someone helps us. But we have to be willing to take that Aid.\n\nNazi3aat (Al Nazi'at) - the pharaoh referenced here is not just the earthly pharaoh, the pharoh there is the human embodiment of evil. A guide has to come to us and say, will you purify yourself. [Surah An-Naziat 79:18] This causes the ego to flee. The ego does no want to submit. I am “YOUR LORD” [Surah An-Naziat 79:24]- the ego will say “that person isn’t a real guide” “they’re not the same madhhab/religious tradition”, any argument needed to preserve it in its dominant state.  \n\nDr Bilals first visit to Senegal\nHe had a picture of Bamba on a pendant around his neck. Went to Senegal - was buying a pair of bootleg air jordan’s.  Bilal was an  American convert at the height of salafism in America at age 15. It must be Shirk to have the pendant of a man like that? You don’t need an intermediary between you and god.  \nSaw someone wearing a pendant with bamba on it, asked why he needed an “intermediary between him and god” the merchant responded: “I guess it must be the “All men are created equal thing” but we all know that’s not true. You play basketball, and you know you’re not as good as Jordan. If you study physics as hard as you can will you ever be as good at physics as Albert Einstein. The people given the most innate talent for spirituality- we call them prophets, after that, we call them Awliyya. Get behind one of them, to get further.\nFollow someone gifted in this domain. External to you so they can see things about yourself you can’t see. And have experience in treating diseases of the nafs. Sit with the people of knowledge till you find yours. Just because someone is a real guide doesn’t mean they’re yours. Spend time till you find yours. (important)\n\nLevels of Piety: \nProphets- messengers (most innate talent for spirituality)\nWali-Saints (Ally's of God)\nThose who are serious about making progress in the religion.\n\nFollow someone who is gifted\n\nMountains (reminder of God’s Majesty) - Rububbiyah Malikiyyah && Oceans (reminder of God’s Mercy) \nIf you’re on a hike without a guide, how can you be sure you’ll get to the top? If it is absolutely crucial that you reach your destination, you won’t say “I’m smart I could figure it out” or “I’m going to read about it in a book or look in a map and do it”. No, if it is a matter of life or death that we reach the destination by a certain period of time, what are you going to do? If you’re serious about getting to the destination, serious to learn about God to be taught through him himself, let’s find someone who can guide us along the way. \n\nNafs is rooted in the appetites and habits of a person. The way that Bamba directs treating the nafs is through fasting… you starve a fire. \n\nBefore the fast - we’re freaking out. Haha! The appetites are going to be suppressed. After a few days you feel liberated!\n\nWe need an emergency application - fast. When our internal pharaoh makes moves. Let’s fast.\n\nQuestion/Answer Period:\nIs a guide really necessary if they have people around them who remind them of God?\nUnless your immediate family members have escaped from  the prison of their Nafs Hawa Shatan and Dunya - then yes, you’ll need a guide. The patterns of their own habits and appetites will structure your environment and you will inhabit their illnesses. If you don’t heal as an individual - then you’ll need to heal as a group.\n\nIt’s hard to hear. It is part of Gods mercy. God uses people to guide people. In doing so he provides benefit to the guide and the guided. \nYou would have rather this book come down from an angel, or just come down from heaven. People didn’t like the idea that you had to take this teaching from a person. The Prophet (PBUH) modeled what we are supposed to be like from our teacher. \nAngel Gabriel sits down knee to knee with the prophet. https://sunnah.com/bukhari/2/43 \nThe prophet modeled the appropriate submissiveness when someone is receiving lifesaving knowledge. Knee to knee, submissive.\n\nMODELING\nThe angel Gabriel is the one who taught Muhammad (pbuh) the Quran. Muhammad's (pbuh) station is superior (higher ontological standing in the order of the universe) to Gabriel. \nYet he behaves like a schoolchild with their master - he is MODELING the appropriate SUBMISSIVENESS that is required when one is receiving life saving knowledge. \n\nTowards the end of Surah Kahf - Moses likewise has to submit to the knowledge/guidance of Khidhr. Even after God favors/chooses us we need to have guidance. \n\nRecommended by Dr. Bilal: Diseases of the Nafs by Imam Fode Drame. \n\nSecond part is focusing specifically on Nafs(going through the big picture now).\n\nIstighfar - asking Allah’s(SWT) forgiveness, is cleansing of the entire being/the whole of the being, not just nafs.\n“After prophethood there is no spiritual station available for a man that isn’t available for a woman.”\n\nQuestion (On finding a Cheikh)\nQ: How do you know this person is a guide?\nIs this person around us (America) or do we have to travel?\n\nA: Yes there are such people around us.\nCheikh Ibrahim Niasse describes the characteristics of a consummate Cheikh, went into detail about what they were required to have, then he says you might be wondering where you'll ever find such a person. You must now be convinced that such a person is rarer than a mythical creature. The truth is you don't have to worry about that. As soon as you need a guide, your guide will present themselves to you. \n2. Shaytan\nHow do we repel an attack from the shaytan?\n-> Remedy: Dhikr (the remembrance of God). \n\nPassion - Hawa\nMaterial attachment - Dunya\nLower Self - Nafs\n-> These other three enemies can become assets for you on your journey once they have been purified and guided. They can provide benefit to humanity, your unique imprint. Nafs al lawwama - the blaming soul that begins to reproach itself for the things it has done, it can move on to become the soul at peace/the contented soul/the one that is pleasing to Allah(SWT) and pleased by Allah(SWT).\n\n[Dr. Bilal references Tazkiya Tul Nafs - 7 stations of the soul]\n\nAssets\nThe things that are specific about you, become assets. Things written on your soul and your soul alone, can provide benefit to humanity that no one else can. Likewise\nYour passions, things that you have emotions, feelings and commitment to, even your worldly possessions can be used for good.\n\nShaytan is your manifest enemy; he is not hiding his enmity for you. It’s something that can’t be transformed. White supremacy is out in the open - it’s plain to see devilry. (Dr Bibal - the satanic origins of white supremacy, racism and capitalist consumption)\n\nWhen the Devil refused to bow to Adam(AS) was God(SWT) surprised? No, He was not surprised since He knows everything, He was fully informed that Iblis would make that decision, so God(SWT) made iblis precisely to perform the function he’s performing. \nMasalik al jinan - Cheikh Amadou Bamba says - “Never forget that shaytan is just a dog set upon you by it’s master.” Shaytan is weak. This is why Shaytan doesn’t really deal with people who are caught up with their lower nafs - one whisper, they’re done for the next 10 years. So as soon as you start working on yourself you have shaytan working you hard. \n\nOneness of god + oneness of humanity = good\nDivision of god + division of humanity = evil.\n\nAs soon as you escape from the prison of your own nafs you can help someone out of  the prison of their own nafs, you become a problem to shaytaan. \n\nHow does Shaytaan go about proving that we are not worthy of the love bestowed upon us?\n\nHe is going to get us to neglect our duties, if our purpose is remembrance of God, Dhikr has no time or conditions attached to it. \n\nThings written on your soul and your soul alone, can benefit humanity.\n\nThere are no conditions on dhikr. And there’s never a time in which dhikr is forbidden to you. It means you should always be in remembrance of God. If not with tongue, then with heart.\n\nSo Shaytan will work to make you forget.\n\nThe Muridiyyah/Tijaniyya teach it with an exercise - easy.\nCall to prayer comes. Shaytan says: don’t pray. You say: naww, I’m going to go pray. Sh: Thuhr time is wide. “You: naw, I’m going to pray now” “Sh: wait” (Deny, delay, diminish.)\nThis is why we say - 23uthu billahi min al shaytan al rajeem. Take away the negative before we pray, a positive act\n\nYou have to purify before you fortify (beautiful way to put it). (it's not my words, from Angelica Lindsey Ali - Village Auntie Awesome, added to the quotes section on the bottom, will reference)\n\nPeople often ask, “what invalidates a fast?” but people rarely ask “what diminishes a fast?” What invalidates a fast is eating or drinking but what diminishes a fast is looking at something you shouldn’t be looking at, it is saying something you shouldn’t be saying. We have come to think of things in this Deen as black and white/ halal and haram. But there are degrees in everything God(SWT) creates, because God’s(SWT) creation is subtle. Don't think just about what's going to invalidate or meet a minimum requirement, think about what is going to diminish and what is going to make your worship more perfect. \n\nPRINCIPLE: Remove blameworthy traits then adorn with positive.\n\nIf you try to make progress without removing blameworthy traits. \nLike putting nice juice in a dirty cup.\nOr - you just keep hitting the same roadblocks. If you don’t clean/purify first, you won't ever make it with all that baggage. \n\nThat's what’s meant by people racing to the throne, those that want to excel - lost my train of thoughts here - those who are striving are not only trying to fulfill but excel.\n\n99 names. Exist in pairs of beauty/majesty. Adjectives to describe God’s attributes. They correspond to actual realities/entities. Things that exist with God. We can call upon that name, that reality becomes manifest in the heart of the one that makes the call. \nYa Lateef! - The Subtle, The Most Gentle (invoking it into reality) \n\nComplete litanies one can make - Bismillah Al Rahman Al Raheem. \n\nIf God is the master of the dog, and you have an obstacle to know you’re not self sufficient and in danger at all times. So you don’t think of yourself as a God to be worshiped in exchange for the real God. Call upon God to choke the dog, call upon the master.\n\nWhile Dr. Bilal is teaching that there are distinctions in the nature of the specific attack, understand these different enemies connect with one another in their attack.\nSo when shaytan causes you to be forgetful of God, that reinforces that false divinity inside you. \n3. Passions/Desires - Hawa - Caprice - Whims \nHawa/shahwa - used interchangeably in the quran. \n\nSurah Taha: God instructs Musa to not follow anyone who follows their own passions [Surah Taha 20:16]. It will lead you to loss. \nMusa got caught up once when the grief/pain of the suffering of people by Pharaoh caused him to strike a man and kill him. He knew the danger of excessive emotions - letting our feelings get away from us. \n\nMoses struck a man once out of passion and killed him. He then had to flee for his life. \n\nOften passion manifests as sexual excess. \n\nBamba’s treatments (2) for Hawa -- 2 types of fasting as remedy: Fast from speech, fast from conjugal activity.\n\nHadith: Prophet Muhammad said: If a person with faith (mu2minoon) - can guarantee me two parts of the body, I can guarantee them paradise. The part between the teeth, and the part between the thighs. \n->  Discipline the tongue and the sexual organs. \n\nThink of mu2minoon in a more expansive way - we don’t know people’s conditions with God, nor their hearts, containing a mustard seed of faith it won't be lost. \n\nhttps://sunnah.com/bukhari/81/63 \n\nWhen were you carried away by your emotions except that it was your tongue that carried you there.\n\nFasting from speech are two forgotten practices of people of spiritual training. \nMary upon the birth of Isa (AS) and Zakarriya, father of John the baptist. \n\nMaghrib to maghrib - 3 days. Undertake this practice. \nYou realize how much of your life is the mere wagging of your tongue.  \nOnly use your tongue for ritual, God and salawat. No talking to people. Talk to God. \nSocial Media Fast - it can provide a remedy. \n\nA fast from a marital activity (with permission from spouse) - both sexes have rights to sexual satisfaction - if a man cannot perform sexually a woman has automatic right for divorce.\n4. Dunya \t- Worship of world/wealth. Desire to be seen.\nHalf of session 3. All of session 4. \nWe are constantly provoked to consumption in Late Capitalism. \n\nWe suffer from Dunya big time in our time. You see your value as a human being as being bound up to your possessions, credit rating, what you can buy. \n\nCapitalism is a competing & incompatible with religious system that’s competing and incompatible with ALL FAITHS.\n\nIt’s applying transcendent meaning to inanimate objects. It is actually worse than idol worship.\n\nIdris (AS) brought the original Tawheed in writing in hieroglyphics. Amen - the end of our prayers - Ameen - comes from Egyptian “god” , ‘Amen’ signified by the scarab beetle. That’s why in the Quran, the religion of the people of Egypt is not disparaged, the religion of pharaoh claiming divinity for himself is disparaged. \n\nWhen Musa (AS) takes the word to pharoah, he asks “So who is this Lord of yours, O Musa?” Musa responds “He is the Lord who gave everything its form and then guided it.” Pharaoh then asks, “and what of the former generations?”, Musa responds, “their knowledge is with my Lord in a book- He never errs nor forgets.” [Surah Taha 20:50-52]\n\nThe religion of the ancient egyptians, in its origin, was founded on these principles - the religion of the ancient egyptians wasn’t anyone of those it was specific.\n\nAside: Ancient egyptian religious system in relation to Islamic Tawheed. \n\nAmen represented as a scarab beetle as a symbol - scarabs emerge on a pile of dung as fully formed beetles. Symbol of something that doesn’t have parents, just emerges just like that. So amen is represented as a scarab. God is not begotten, He does not come from parents.\n\nCapitalism is worse than idol worship - symbolic register for discussing divinity. Not understood, we think idol worship is so evil yet we misunderstand capitalism. Crack the whip to send people back to work in the middle of a plague. Wealth is > human life. \n\nIf worldly attachment and valuing yourself in comparison to possessions. Performance of things for other people. Big social media problem. Then simple fast from words is not enough. You need to withdraw completely from the world. Moses did 40 days of spiritual retreat. You can do 24 hours of itikaaf in the mosque. You can cloister in the room of your home. \n\nRemedy: Khalwa/retreat/itikaf. You can retreat to a secluded place near nature to better contemplate the universe and your position in it. \n\nHow many of us worship objects we know were made by people with their own two hands (can we get more examples of this?)\n\n\nDesire to be seen as pious by others. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Causes tremendous harm.\n\nUthman Dan Fodio (name?) has the best teaching on purifying desire to be seen as pious.\n\n\nNafs - Ego - Lower Soul - treatment: Self - Fasting\nShaytan - Devil - Force of Evil - teatment: Remembrance of God (dhikr)/His Names\nHawa - Passions - Caprice - Emotionality -treatment:  Fast From Speech/Conjugal Activities\nDunya - Material Attachments - treatment: Desire to be Seen in the Eyes of People - Spiritual Retreat/Khalwa\n\n(Thank you for making these notes folks May Allah Bless you all!) (Thank you for being here and learning with us!) \n\n[POST BREAK]\n\n“Woe unto the slave of ornaments houses \nSuch will remain prisoner of vanities world and devil\nHabits are those of animals\nOver eating remaining promiscuous “ \n\nReading from Jihad of the Pen (Dr Bilal Ware) Page 147 \nVerses (685–94)\nSelf: Ego–Soul (nafs)\nAmong [the created enemies] is your nafs, and this is the most dangerous of them all. Never give in to its desires, my friend, never gratify it; treat it with strictness and suspicion. Indeed the honor of a person is in measure with the woes and pains they inflict on their nafs. Be wise; struggle against your ego (nafs) by carrying out God’s command and raising His Word high. Make your own continuous reckoning of your soul, and God will lighten His on the Day of Reckoning. Remind yourself of death at all times, and be always vigilant and wary of your nafs, like a person in the presence of a hungry lion. Such a person would be terrified at all times that the slightest lapse would put them at the lion’s mercy. It is this kind of vigilance and care regarding the nafs that is of benefit to a person, for it keeps them running back to their Lord for help.\n\nIf you ever think you are safe from your lower self - he just got you. It can always return to the original state at any time because it knows you and all of your devices. \n It's not (just) about getting free. It's about staying free. \nIt means self scrutiny. Periodically fast. Constant reckoning. \n\nWhat is the mercy? Who is the mercy to all the worlds. Every messenger was a mercy. Muhammed is a mercy to all the worlds. And anyone that strives behind them can become a mercy too. \n\nYou will not enter the garden till you have faith and you will not enter faith until you have loved one another. https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah/33/36 - it’s not just mercy amongst yourself - it’s mercy in general (Not in the hadith above, it’s important to find the complete one). \n\n\nThose who don’t have mercy on others (who we think believe differently than us) are not on the road. \n\nImportantly in these days, we are a victim of the nafs.The nafs is the home of our identity politics.\n\nMany of us believe our personal choices and proclivities are rooted in religion when in fact they are rooted in NAFS (reinforcing our own ego.)\n\nCan someone help me fill in these notes? I missed this part (not just a part of his work, but the best part of his work) which work? -- Human beings (he was referring to humans killing other humans as their misinformed definition of ‘jihad’, not seeing how that’s a huge affront to God, the Creator)\n\n“... a Lord they pretend to love, but whom they worship poorly by destroying His work, and best part of his work.”\n(I missed the first part). About killing non-believers, I think. \n\nNone of us know the condition of our own soul at death, much less the soul of our neighbor. \n\nQuestion / Answers:\n\nNadia: Expand on needing a guide please. \nA: Short answer, I process as a historian. Primary training. Part is a question about tariqa and part is about sufism as an institution. Tariqa is a contingent institution that comes into existence at a particular moment in Islamic history to safeguard a particular type of spiritual training that existed at the time of the prophet, transmitted through Ali ra & others in the time of it being in peril.\n\nMost principal scholars, Usman dan Fodio for example point out - being a part of a tareeka isn’t a requirement of the religion for spiritual fulfillment, but practicing tasawwuf is, it is the fulfillment of the condition of ihsan that is offered in the hadith of Gabriel, purifying the spirit. You need a guide to get to this point (of islam, iman, ihsan) because somebody who knows God needs to guide you to the knowledge of God. it’s crucial because until you have direct experiential knowledge of God how do you know it’s God that you’re worshipping rather than a construction of your intellect or imagination. Your guide may not belong to an organized tareeqa, they should have a chain of transmission for their teachings. One-to-one training, master to disciple. \n\nSit not just with people of knowledge, but also people with good character. People can claim spiritual station. Relationship between ethics and spirituality.  Genuine spiritual experience is incompatible with poor ethics. Akhlaq leads to haqaa2iq. Observe people’s character. \n\n\nMariam: Desire to be seen. How do you correlate intention with the desire to be seen? How do you know when your desire to be seen is from shaytan/dunya?\nA: Some were wondering if they should make dhikr quiet or aloud? Some wanted to go aloud. Quiet without ostentation. Others want to inspire others by doing it out loud. Reward for inspiring the others. Bamba resolves this beautifully. The middle path has not been found. whoever fears ostentation let him be quiet. Those who don’t fear ostentation due to their certainty purity, it’s ok to recite aloud. Depends where you are on the path, where your heart is in that particular moment, depends on the moment. Offering a deed to other than Allah - becomes a deed you will be punished for. \n“Pleasing people is a goal you will never attain. How foolish that you will seek it in exchange for God’s wrath.”\n-Osman Dan Fodio.\n\nQ Tasneem Siddiqui: What’s so important about understanding how racial capitalism and colonialism are all bound up. Racial capitalism works because of violence. Cedric Robinson helped us articulate Racial Capitalism. There is no green capitalism. No anti-racist capitalism. How do we flush ourselves of this value system? \nA:\nThe cultural mechanism that functions in this way in west Africa is sadaqa. It’s not charity in a western sense. It's an expiation of sin. You do have to do it (participate in a sinful system - western capitalism) because you have to eat. That’s why: Purify your wealth, purify your wealth, purify your wealth. Sadaqa existed before zakat came as a practice. It’s a primordial call to give charity. It’s called sadaqa because without it your religion is not true (siddiq). \nExpiating sinfulness by giving. \nTransforming to alternative economic models rooted in self sustaining practices.\nUsed by west african sufi communities protect themselves from systems they can’t control. \n\nWasat Breaking The Idols - The Way of Iblis. Racism / white supremacy and capitalism, two idols of our time - erected in the enslavement of black people. Defining devilry of the time, MUST be defeated in order for the system to fall away. Tentacles of racial capital are a function of modern states policing, which is rooted in racial capitalism. Corporations don’t exist before the atlantic slave trade. The Atlantic Slave Trade produces them! HopeThe tentacles extend everywhere. If you stab at the heart of the beast all the tentacles will follow. If Black people are free here people will be freed everywhere. Everybody knows this instinctively, because it’s a reality in the unseen. We have to fulfill it. This is why I’m doing this work right now, God will hold me to account for anything I withheld in this moment. \nLink to talk: Breaking the idols\n\nNdidi: What are the boundaries. What is the delivery of service? Expectations? Full submission or dependence / reliance? Those with responsibility abusing it. \nA: There is such a thing as Spiritual abuse. \nWhen you feel diminished or manipulated. That’s not teaching islam.\nYou’re meant to be stretched beyond your comfort level. Take on postures of humility and submissiveness - if you can’t lower yourself to someone who gives you sacred knowledge, how will you do that for God?\n\nWhen it becomes manipulation, when it becomes exploitative. Not when your nafs rejects it. When your heart rejects it. When your spirit is wounded. \nYour nafs should be pierced by your tarbiyyah(personal spiritual development). Your heart / spirit should be liberated.\n\nTeachings of imam ghazali: The Nafs and its relationship with other parts of the body. \nThe thing that you think is ‘you’  is a weak frail ugly diseased creature that will never believe: is your nafs. It causes crippling illnesses of the heart. It abuses the heart.\nIf the nafs can be killed, if it dies, it sets your heart free. The dead nafs leaves an orphan, escorted into the palace of the ruh, by the angels of the right and angels of the left. The spirit: she will be free from the constant chattering of the ego and the appetites. \nWhat you were meant to be will come to fruition because you’re free from the distractions of his nafs pulling himself here or elsewhere.  Free from answering the commands of the nafs. \n\nGhazali wrote ihya 3lum eddine - The Revival of the Religious Sciences, people thought he wrote it to make people better muslims. He had to go serve a guide after acquiring knowledge. He wrote it to produce better scholars. Once the heart is set free, you are free to be a better everything (scholar, writer, artist, performer). Once you set yourself free from the tyranny of the thing that you //THINK// is you.\n\nOnly someone that has been set free should ever be allowed to guide anyone else. \n\nToo many people want to be sheikhs but they haven’t finished their tarbiyyah yet. \n“Too many chiefs, not enough ___*” Everybody wanna be guiding everybody else. \n\nTa3leem - education\nTarbiyyah - personal spiritual development\nTarqiyah - ascension \n\nFind what you need to cross each of these steps. Pieces come differently for different people, from different kinds of guides/experience.\n\nPraise to the Lord, the best of spiritual trainers. - shaykh ahmadou bamba \nThe only Murabbiy is God. Everyone else is a Hijab: a proximate cause through which the teaching is received. If you understand that, you understand the good or the ill of your sincere suluk is God’s personalized performance of His identity for you. His majesty and beauty in your life. Everything is destined for none other than you, you are supposed to be learning from it. \n\nThe guide who knocks, takes you through the door, and doesn’t leave until you’re inside. When you’ve had to deal with travails and strife in order to get there. Don’t put yourself in the hands of debauched degenerates. \nGod is worth it. The first time you draw breath free, you won't believe you have ever wanted anything else. \n\n\nCasey - spiritual bypassing of falsely claiming oneness/unity. example: All lives matter excludes black lives. Also relates to identity politics - capitalistic institutions dilutes and encourages dilution of antiracism and organizing into the label of identity politics… how do we engage the subtlety without getting lost in the dilution of identity politics, or dismissing the importance of movement work negotiating power and oppression. \n\nA: The statement itself “all lives matter” is not an argument, it is a disingenuous retort. At some level - the critique of portions of movement work right now as being based in identity politics - there’s truth in that critique. Un-reformed people that are not free from the prisons of their lower souls, are trying to get personal forms of validation for choices that they’ve made with their lives. That’s a huge part of what’s out there. Because of that it becomes power struggles, getting affirmation and access to resources. That’s rooted in genuine justice concerns. Having systematic disadvantages distributed against Black and Brown people through the system is something that has to be redressed. It cannot be left alone, you have to take action with your hand if you can. But the problem is what kind of action? If the action is rooted in strictly a power response, power is being inflicted upon me, therefore I am going to inflict power back at power. Then you have power versus power. And you go with your own strength and you win some and lose some. In my estimation, this is a battle we cannot win in this way. Because the forces of corporate capitalism and violent repressive states, (“Nigga, ranting and raving about gats, They got some shit that’ll blow out our backs” - OutKast), if this is going to be about power struggle we are going to lose that power struggle. So we have to have our eyes higher than that, and that only happens when you set yourself free from the personal weaknesses. And it becomes about providing a transcendent narrative for spiritual redemption in which both the oppressed and the oppressor get free. And no one is saying that now! And that is the only thing that made King’s movement work and what made Gandhi's movement work. Nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience are tools, they are material tools, sometimes they work sometimes they don’t work. It depends on how the cards are dealt at the table. What causes a fundamental shift in this created world is not making a calculus on the basis of identity and power in this created world, it is an eruption from the unseen into the seen world. When something transcendent comes from the other side in, it reorients the whole movement of the dunya. How do I know?  Because what is the Quran except an eruption from the unseen to the seen? Comes out of the ghaib, in the body, in the heart of one man, Rasuloolah (PBUH) and it changes the world! \nI teach every year, about 1000 years of history in West Africa where I see empires rise and fall, kingdoms come and go. Colonizers, imperial states, slave traders, Anti-Slavery Movements, European imperialist, the kings come and go; they all change. The people that rooted their power in teaching God’s word and remedying the sicknesses in the hearts of the children of Adam -are still doing that same work today and they survived all those changes. No one even remembers who the kings of Ghana were…but the people that specialized in ethical teaching in the empire of Ghana, people with the name Cisse, Toure, Drame, Djame are still lifting hearts and freeing people. We are lacking! We have not formulated the language to take those transcendent timeless values and insert them into this moment. That’s why I am here. I want us to find a way to speak these timeless truths in these changed times. Because if we do not put a beacon of light to orient people for them to walk by, then people with dark hearts will orient the movements. They won’t know that they did it, they won't mean anything bad by it. The Panthers were trying to protect people, but they hadn't been cleansed. So instead they fought power with power. If we are not cleansed with dhikr, “go you and your brother with My signs and do not slack in My remembrance”. That’s Moses and Aaron going to pharaoh; we gotta go to pharaoh but we cannot slack in the remembrance, the remembrance has to be the core of it and it is the only thing that will give us guidance. \n\nSonia: You talked about materialism. I’m a woman who likes fashion. Are you advocating for anti-asceticism? I have a closet full of shoes. Capitalism incompatible with any faith tradition, what alternative are you offering?\nA. Not advocating for socialism/marxism, far from it. - They’re also rooted in materialistic calculus. Socialism fails because it does not provide an alternative transcendent spirituality and ethics. The people who run it are not healed. \nCapitalism -> Socialism - antiTHESIS - contains the thesis inside it. You ingested the poison when you swallowed the antidote. \nAn alternative economic logic that’s not rooted just in materialist calculus, but that comes from timeless spiritual teachings rooted in human ethics that are lateral. When Musa as goes to Pharaoh in surah qasas, he says So who is the God of you Moses? \n\nGod of Heaven & Earth - if you would have Certainty\nGod of East & West - for those with reason \nFaith in vertical axis\nReason lateral axis\nWithout adding a new dimension  - we can’t solve it.\nWe have to dig into spiritual resources. \n\nThe primary critique of the Quraish is their consumption. \nMecca: They kill their children because they consider their kids to be an economic drain?\nKill Muhammed because the Kaaba is their money maker. \n\nActual Islam - not this mainstream, bourgouise, middle class fake religion. Capitalism as religion, Islam as ritual observance. Middle class respectability & conspicuous consumption as sunnah is what we have (fake islam) if it aint’ about God and his Messenger (PBUH) it ain’t my business. If we actually look at what the prophet was sent to do, rectify social and economic relationships, rectify those vertical relationships between the created beings and their Creator.  Those lateral relationships are not just with human beings. Those lateral relationships are not just with human beings - with environment, animals, all creation. Khalifa on earth. Why do you think there are so many spiritual sicknesses right now? We tore down all the places where Jinn used to live. They’re hunting us in our homes because we tore down theirs (jinn). \nI don’t mean to return to Arabia in the 7th century. There’s nothing wrong with possessions unless the possessions possess you. \nShaykh Hassan Cisse (May Allah be Pleased with Him) made this dua, “Oh Allah, fill our hearts with You and our hands with dunya”. \n\nBamba says self-sufficiency is the best of states. \nGratitude in abundance is better than patience in poverty - Bamba\n\nThere is no ascetism/monkship in islam. Khalwa is for specific periods in order to rectify one’s moral state. But going out and worshipping solo, how will you bring back the benefits of your spiritual cleansing to the rest of your fellow humans?\n\nRacial capitalism is gendered, it produces gender violence as its very nature.\nIn affirming a narrow rules-based version of Islam, you are complicit in state mechanisms of control over women’s bodies. And God will put no blessing in it, as long as we cut off the bearers of the womb. Because the name Rahman shares its name with the Rahim - the womb. No mercy comes when you cut off the source of mercy. \n\nThank you Dr. Bilal!\n\n\n\nto\nBring a mango to the next class!\nRipest \nJuiciest\n\nI would love people to share their lessons learned if they’d like :)\n\n\nWhatever God wants, will hit you.\nQuestions:\n\nQuestion\nResponse: \nVotes for Q: Put x \nHow do you escape Solid Faith if it “admits no foreign element” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions from Class One\nHow do you know when you defeated the nafs, and have killed the ego?\n\n\nxxxxxxxxx\nHow do you know the difference or tell if the wrongness (haraam) in your spirit comes from the shaytan rajim or from our nafs?\n\n\nxxxx\nHow to determine whether a shaykh is true or not?

Do you mean being connected to a particular sheikh that guides you\nUnless your immediate family members have escaped from the prison of the nafs you will need a guide, their illnesses will be your illnesses (unfinished)\n\n\nSo were prophets chosen based on who they were? \n\n\n\n\nIs the nafs the shaytan rajeen (jinn) on each one of our hearts?\n\n\n\n\nHow do we know who are guides and where can we find them? Do we need to travel?\nYes, they are in America. Ibrahim Ilyas described the traits of a consummate sheikh and then he said you may be wondering where you will find such a person. You must be convinced that they are rarer than a mythical creature. Truth is, you don’t have to worry about that. As soon as you need your guide the way that a man lost in the desert needs a cold drink - then you will find your guide. As soon as you become rooted in sincere conviction that you can’t persist in this state any longer you will take whatever step necessary to find that person. - your guide can be a man or a woman. \nUntil you have experiential knowledge of God, how do you know that it was God that you were worshipping?\nHow can we really understand the shaytan if we never have felt his presence? Is it real or an aspect of negative self talk? Negative other humans?\n\n\n\n\nDid the prophet Muhammed S fast from speaking? Did he recommend it for any of his sahaba? \n\n\nx\nHow does capitalism imbue meaning to inanimate objects? Don’t get it. Because it’s the fundamental aim of capitalism to collect?\n\n\nx\nWhat’s the difference between a prophet and a messenger? There was over 100,000 prophets and less than 300 prophets.\n\n\n\n\nHow many of us worship objects we know were made by people with their own two hands (can we get more examples of this?)\n\n\n\n\nWhen you refer to people of Imaan beyond the way we think of it, are you also referring to non-Muslims (i.e., Buddhists, hindus, atheists…)\n\n\n\n\nWas the egyptians “Believers” of tawheed before there was a messenger? (Musa)\n\n\nx\nWhen we are taught to love/work/commit etc for the sake of Allah - is this perceived as a form of dhikr?\n\n\nx\nIs this content generally the teachings of Sunni Islam, or specific to your Tariqa? E.g. academically if we refer to these concepts, do we say in the Islamic tradition, in Bamba’s tradition, or in the Mouride tradition? To where do we attribute?\n\n\n\n\nAre the solutions to the 4 enemies meant to be comprehensive or are their secondary, tertiary defenses/remedies to be discussed? \n\n\n\n\nWhen you said “doubt comes from shaytan” what does this mean? human nature is to not doubt oneself...can you expand on this concept\n\n\nXxxx\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should we expect from our guides in order to defeat our nafs?\nPart of it is about ‘tariqa’, but joining tariqa is not a requirement to gain spiritual fulfilment. Practicing ‘tasawuf’ is however. Somebody who knows God has to guide you in finding God. A guide can be a teacher that you give permission to give you spiritual training.  They don’t have to be from a tariqa but they should be familiar with the structural organization of it. Sit with people of knowledge, but just as importantly sit with people with character and ethics.\n\n\nHow do you correlate intention to the desire to be seen (in relation to the enemy of dunya)?\nIt depends on where you are on the path, where your heart is at that moment. If you fear eyes on you in that moment and feel performative, don’t do it, because if you do then you have offered a deed other than to Allah. Pleasing people will be a deed that you will never attain.\nx\nHow do we purify our attachment to materialism and capitalism when all of it is all racism capitalism? How do we get to a place where we can flush ourselves from this value system?\nThe cultural mechanism that helps deal with this problem in West Africa is Sadaqa. If you understand you have to partake in the sin of capitalism simply to feed your family, then Sadaqa becomes a means of countering sinfulness by giving back.\n\n\nWhat are the boundaries to having a guide? What is the delivery of service? How do you stay away from a full dependence/reliance?\nThere is such a thing as spiritual abuse. And when you feel diminished or manipulated, that is not teaching of Islam. You are meant to be taught to be submissive to the teaching of spiritual guidance because if you cannot lower yourself to gain spiritual knowledge, you can’t lower yourself to accept Allah. But when your spirit feels drained and not liberated, you are in the wrong setting. Overall, God is worth it. He is worth the search.\n\n\nHow do you get over the false expression of oneness ex: saying “All Lives Matter” and bypassing “Black Lives Matter.”\nALM is not an argument, it is a retort. If this is going to be about a power struggle, then we are going to lose that struggle. We have to have our eyes higher than that, outside of our personal level. We must have a solution that frees the oppressed and the oppressor. We need an eruption from the unseen into the seen. It has to be made outside of identity politics. We must find a way to speak the timeless truth of history into our changed times. If we don’t go with dhikr, with our hearts cleansed and in remembrance of Allah, then we will not go right.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we understand we need to give up our attachment from materialism, how do we manage it with just wanting nice things? Also capitalism is advocated against, but does that mean we should go to socialism, communism, etc.?\nNo, because the same materialistic problems found in capitalism are found in the other ‘isms’. They have no effective alternative. So what is suggested is an ethical economic system that is rooted in spiritual guidedness. In regards to materialism, there is nothing wrong with possessions, until they possess you.\n\n\nIs giving importance to how we are seen by others in the context of our work (managers/colleagues) regarding our skills and level of knowledge part of the Donya enemy? (I am not talking about working just to show of but caring about whether we are doing good, and needing validation)\nIf so, how to overcome that? kholwa, to not think about work ? how to gain confidence through God? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre each of the enemies of spiritual growth connected to  a natural element? Earth, wind (passion?), water and fire (nafs). And does our temperament (hot and dry-earth, hot and moist-, as taught by Ibn Seena, say something about which enemy we’re more prone \n\n\nx\nAllah stamps seal the hellfire, did this include the fire of nufs?

It is related that Shaykh Hasan al-Basri (r.a), Shaykh Malik ibn Dinar (r.a), and Shaykh Shaqiq al-Balkhi (r.a) went to visit Rabi’a (r.a.).  The conversation turned to the question of sincerity as they attempted to offer her solace.\n\nShaykh Hasan (r.a) said, “None is sincere is his claim to love God, unless he patiently endures the Blows of his Lord.”\n\nShaykha Rabia(r.a) said, “This talk stinks of egotism.”\n\nShaykh Shaqiq (r.a),  attempting to elevate the answer and definition, said, “None is sincere is his claim to love God unless he is not grateful for the Blows of his Master.”\n\nShaykha Rabia(r.a) said, “We need something better than this.”\n\nShaykh Malik ibn Dinar (r.a) said, “None is sincere is his claim to love God unless he does not delight in the Blows of his Master.”\n\nShaykha Rabia (r.a) said, “We need something better than this.”\n\nThey said, “Now you speak.”\n\nShaykha Rabia (r.a) said: “ No one is sincere in his claim to love God, unless he forgets the Blows in beholding his Lord, from enduring, to giving thanks, to delighting, to forgetting the tribulation in his love for God.”\n\n\"\n\nPractices:\nBring a mango.\n\nBring matches lighter single half sheet of paper to class\n\nListen to surat yusuf every day\n\nReflection:\nPRINCIPLE: \nRemove blameworthy traits then adorn with positive.\n\nHadith References:\n\nNarrated Sahl bin Sa`d:\nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Whoever can guarantee (the chastity of) what is between his two jaw-bones and what is between his two legs (i.e. his tongue and his private parts), I guarantee Paradise for him.\"\n-https://sunnah.com/bukhari/81/63\n\nNarrated Abu Huraira:\nOne day while the Prophet (ﷺ) was sitting in the company of some people, (The angel) Gabriel came and asked, \"What is faith?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, 'Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, (the) meeting with Him, His Apostles, and to believe in Resurrection.\" Then he further asked, \"What is Islam?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"To worship Allah Alone and none else, to offer prayers perfectly to pay the compulsory charity (Zakat) and to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan.\" Then he further asked, \"What is Ihsan (perfection)?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you.\" Then he further asked, \"When will the Hour be established?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"The answerer has no better knowledge than the questioner. But I will inform you about its portents.\n1. When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.\n2. When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the construction of higher buildings. And the Hour i\ts one of five things which nobody knows except Allah.\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) then recited: \"Verily, with Allah (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour--.\" (31. 34) Then that man (Gabriel) left and the Prophet (ﷺ) asked his companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion.\" Abu 'Abdullah said: He (the Prophet) considered all that as a part of faith.\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/bukhari/2/43\n\n\nJust like the adjectives of a mango can be described to other things, is the same as the adjectives of Allah can be like to our character traits so experiencing and having knowledge of Allah is like non else.. \nHarun\n\nDescribing is not the same as experiencing. \n\nThe Divine names and attributes can be meaningfully attributed to the Divine Essence, but they are not the Divine Essence. \n\nThe principal obstacles that we have on the Path, setbacks, are scratches in comparison to the thing that is being sought. \n\nDie before you die. \n\nGod becomes an experiential reality that is written in the mirror of your heart. \n\nHow can the like of me contain the like of Him? Like the brilliance of the full moon can be seen reflected in the pond, and the full moon stays where it is. Polish our heart like a mirror, to conquer these 4 obstacles. This process should start in this life instead of the next. Don’t think that the vision of God in this life is not possible. Ahmad ibn Hanbal left authentic accounts of seeing God in his dreams. People with seriousness in this path, God teaches them directly. \n\n\n\nGoal: to acquire a level of certainty, by removing these obstacles from our path, so that God will teach us the things we have no other way of knowing, so we know He is Haqq. \n\nIt’s better to sit with someone who has an already polished mirror, than to sit with yourself trying to polish the mirror yourself. \n\nTarbiya - from outer layer to inner layer. From analogical reasoning to experiential knowledge. \n\nTariqa: way - a path that leads to a destination AND a means/method of doing a thing, the way home, the path you take, the method you use to achieve something. \nNot necessarily for everyone. What is required is tasawwuf. This obligation to worship with ihsan, otherwise your deen is not complete. You must have a teacher to guide you. Teacher to disciple. Everyone needs to get to this stage of worshipping God as if you see it, because until you do, how would you know it’s God that you’re worshipping. Take the way of someone who knows how to get there. Otherwise you’re gonna get lost. Continue to seek out a person who can guide us, until we get there. \n\nIf we feel the pain/look at the scratch, then our attention is divided, our eyes are no longer only upon our Lord. \n\nTheology of Tolerance \nCherno Bokar Salif Tall (d. 1940), from what is now Mali, amplifies the imagery of movement in the Hadith of Gabriel, by assimilating it to the states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. \nSolid Faith: It is suitable for the masses...and teachers who are attached to the letter. Channeled by prescriptions imposed by a law drawn from revealed texts, be they Jewish, Christian, or Islamic, it has a precise form and is subject to rigorous determination which admits no foreign element. [It] is heavy and immobile like a mountain. At times it prescribes armed warfare if this is necessary to gain respect and to assure its position\" \n\nLiquid is the faith of those who have worked and successfully faced up to the trials of sulb, of the rigid law that admits no compromise. They have triumphed over their faults and have set out on the way which leads to Truth...the elements of this faith derive from understanding. It values truths from wherever they come, considering neither their origin nor the date of their existence. It gathers and assembles them in order to make from them a body in perpetual movement not arranged in one particular form. Rather they effect a flow which is constantly forward, like the flow of molecules of water which emerge from the mountain hollows and trickle across varied terrains, flowing together and increasing in size, becoming streams which finally, now as rivers, are thrown into the ocean of the Truth. \nThis faith, due to its subtle, liquid nature, is strong...eroding the rocks of intolerance, pouring forth and taking a shape that is not fixed—as is the case with sulb—but borrowing the form of its receptacle. It neither changes its essence nor retreats. Liquid faith manifests itself as gigantic mystical waterfalls, falling from the mountain into the ravine of active life. It contracts into a sinuous thread to traverse the steep pass...It expands into a great flood plying across a country. This faith is life-giving. \n\nEthereal Faith: \"The third and final form. It is decidedly more subtle...the attribute of a chosen elite. The faith of the sphere of truth emerges entirely from this last form. Those who reach it adore God in truth in the light without color. On this sublime plane solid faith (emerging from revelation) and liquid faith emerging from this uncompromising path, both vanish to make way for one sole thing, al-Haqq, the Truth, which flourishes in the fields of Love and Truth.\" \n\n\nThe fitra of the human being is not self-doubt. \nThe human being says “I got this”. We are self-confident to the fault in our fitra. \nThe shaytan sows doubt. \nDifferentiate between self-reproach and self-doubt. \n\nWhispers that drive you to self doubt and despair, anger, envy, that is shaytan. These are his principal weapons. \n\nBodily intuition - skin gets tight, hair stands on your neck, listen to your body, when you feel something wrong, stop. \nHeart intuition- - it speaks to you in an entire different voice than the shaytan uses. The heart is the place of the divine \nLevel of the spirit (ruh) is distinct from the level of the heart. \nLevel of the spirit associated with creative openings. When you feel your spirit literally being called into action, that is the intuition. \n\nDistinguish between the chatter of your nafs (the main thing, the first enemy) , 90% of what you think is you is the nafs. You won’t hear anything else outside of your nafs. Nafs gives out commands, everything else follows. You talk yourself into something you know ain’t right being right. \n\n*\nSurah Yusuf contains all 4 of the enemies.

It’s out there. \n\nFirst teaching of the last message is title of Dr. Umar’s upcoming book\n\nSisters Session:\nThe sisters session with sheikh Muhammad. \n\nShaykh Abu Madyan; study the lessons from him they are of great benefit. \n\nAt present there are lots of problems in the world but alongside the problems we should also see that there are just as many solutions. \n\nWhen we look around there’s lots of casting of fear into the hearts of people. The news, propaganda etc are all instilling fear into the hearts of people. It’s not real fear. So, don’t be fearful. \n\nThe enemy always like to spread false fears, be hopeful. Don’t allow yourself to be taken by the fear. Allah has facilitated everything for us. We just have to take the first step and Allah will complete our projects for us. Have hope in Allah. \n\nWe should believe deeply that the hearts of our children is in the hands of Allah. Hold the belief firmly. It will bring you ease. \n\nThe One who gives light to someone in complete darkness. Is the One who likewise taking care of your hearts, your children’s heart. So, don’t be fearful but instead be cautious. Rear your children in the best of ways, with love and gentleness \n\nEqually, what is between us and Allah? We become fearful of our actions and whether they will be accepted. Etc. this fear then becomes a barrier between us and Allah. Remember that Allah is merciful, He is the Most Gentle, He is the Most Loving. Return to this and know that to fear Allah is to be distant from Him. The more you fear him, the more distant you become. Until you feel the heat of hellfire. \n\nThe closer you get to Allah the cooler it gets, that coolness continues until you feel such coolness, that’s Firdous Al Alaa. Allah is Generous and Merciful. \n\nWe should be keen on knowing how to worship Allah with what Allah has revealed. Worship Him in the way that has been shown to us. So instead of listening to the ugly news, return to the Quran, read, learn, study the Quran and see all the ways Allah speaks to you. \n\nThere are many teachers now who are learned, so, learn to study Aqeeda and fiqh. Correct knowledge is required for you to worship God and develop nearness to God. \n\nRemembering Allah, be busy with dhikr, do lots of salawats. Dhikr stills the heart, the heart that doesn’t have the remembrance of God is ungrounded, and erratic. Remembrance of God is what calms and brings contentment to the heart. As the dhikr is established in the heart, the heart now has lots of energy. \n\nTime is hard for us, we feel restriction in time. And it maybe too overwhelming to plan to do lots. But establish a routine to do a little of everything. With a little of Quran, sunnah, dhikr, salat, with little of everything you will find abundance and barakah in this. Don’t overburden yourself. And you will find barakah in this. May Allah grant us tawfeeq in this and may He facilitate this. To establish our days in this way and Allah doubles and multiplies us in the good of this. \n\nHow to prevent getting bored when doing dhikr? \n\nThe more you develop in your Ibadah then shaytan comes to trouble you and he’s the one that puts this into your mind, to get you to think it’s boring. When that feeling comes just do something small to push back. That’s the jihad.\n\nHow does one find embodied worth with Allah instead seeking our worth from our jobs, worldy status and material possessions?\n\nPractice and develop the habi of giving, Gratitude to God. There are lots of car models, you may see someone has a better car than you. Or you had a better car last year, and now someone else has a better car. There’s lots of things that come and go but in all this be grateful. Be grateful for whatever you have. However little or a lot you have show gratitude. Whatever is in your hand will be put in your pocket because Allah is in your heart. Dunya in pocket and Allah in your heart nothing will come into your heart. This is the balance. \n\nIf there is one dua for the day \n\nRabba atina fidh dunya hasana…..\n\nWe have forgotten the jewel of this dua. It’s meaning tells us that if you have this you have everything \n\nHow to increase connection to prophet and which part of seerah do you love?\n\nLove and forgiveness. Being pushed away from medina and cast away. And when the beloved messenger returns,he returns he shows such forgiveness to those that wronged him. He said, go and you are free. \n\nIf someone loves someone they will remember them. Do as much salawat of him as you can. \n\nTry this, when you go to bed, before you close your eyes, forgive everyone in your heart and you will feel your heart being polished. You realise the generosity of heart in forgiving. And is there anyone more generous than Allah? \n\nWhen someone has wounded you. Make dua for them and Allah will give them your request and He will also give this to you too and through this your wound will be healed. \n\nHe is not relating a story. He is speaking of personal experience. He grew up in the desert with his father and he saw people oppressing his father, they used to be horrible to him and he would still forgive them. Allah gave my father a long and good life as a result. And sometimes by this way of forgiveness a beautiful reconciliation would come. Even long after he died. \n\nWe ask Allah to make of those who solve problems and carry the best for everyone. The heart of believer is big and vast and it can hold a magnitude of good.\n\nInspiration (Hadith/Quran/Quotes/etc):\n\nInspiration from Dr. Omar: \nOur roles as Muslims is to civilize (as defined by Ibn Khaldoon): To bring maximum benefit and minimum harm with the most number of people collaborating. \nThere are five outward senses and five inward senses. Develop all your senses. \nEmpirical sciences often only look through instruments. People had amazing capacities to understand the universe through their highly tuned senses. \nPeople could sense pregnancies from the wrist. People would know the earths circumference by observation.\nRuh connected to the angelic world is what we want.\nThe Turks don’t speak ill of their leaders, even Attaturk. \nDr Omar: We are the middle community\nWe need to get our own mental frames, not copy others. For instance Antarctica is the crown of the world. The East is blessed. The West is sacred, represents the setting of the sun/death. And the planet is flipped with the North Pole at the bottom which is ominous. \nEveryone in traditional islamic society was a crafts person. From the judges and the wealthy to the poorest people. \nCrafts bring rich/poor people into conversation through guilds. \nThe idea that fixing pronoun use will set things right between the genders is laughable. Some cultures which have difficulties between men and women only have one pronoun. \n\n\n\nSh. Ahmad Saad\nDon’t have a standard. The onion of the one you love is a sheep. Basal al muhib kharoof (Egyptian saying) \nAl mu2min ya2luf wa yu2laf - a believer is loved and is loving. - This saying was said in relation to accepting all things as they are without preferences. \nBe with God like a kid with their mom. All true growth is with God. All other growth will fade. \nThe real Fatih (opening from God) is to see all trials and blessings as nothing.\nAbu Madyan: Al Ghira an ta3ruf wala tu3ruf Honor is to know and not to be known\nWhen you hide your gifts you will see them grow. \n\nImam Zaid Shaker:\nMan Thabata Nabata. He who stays put will produce fruit.\n\nConcept:\nPractical Certainty \nSort of like you know your mother won’t poison you.\n(Bilal: I don’t yet understand this concept. Because in today’s age there may be mothers who poison you, how can you base your epistemology on this pillar?)\n\nQuote: \nHe who doesn’t submit to one worth submitting to no good will come from them.\n-From Dr. Omar, not sure the source\n\n\nQuote: Dr. Omar - Jesus said speak the truth with love. This is our goal not to oppose, and to still speak the truth so it can be heard. \n\nConcept:\nPractical Certainty \nSort of like you know your mother won’t poison you.\n(Bilal: I don’t yet understand this concept. Because in today’s age there may be mothers who poison you, how can you base your epistemology on this pillar?)\n\nDr. Omar Advice: Don’t go to a country without going with someone from that land.\n\nConcept:\nAl Yaqeen al waqi3ee\nA certain type of knowledge you get from empathy. \nAl Yashruti - Described the epistemology of empathy. He had a daughter who was a well known saint.\nHumility + altruism = virtue \n\n\nConcept: Corrective Tradition AKA The Verification Tradition has a long illustrious chain\n\nPersonal Reflection:\nFrom Dr. Omar: God is one. \nThe Good, The Beautiful, The Just (these names are special, I wasn’t able to catch why.)\nThe Good helps create multiplicity from unity. \n\nBilal’s reflections: The Good can’t be good unto itself, it needs an other. Perhaps this is how multiplicity is necessitated from the need of The Good to become manifest in order for Good to be extant.\n\n\nReferences (Books, People):\nBook: Thomas wolf, You Can’t Go Home Again.\n\n\n\nJan 4th, 2023\n\nSession II - Adab Al Murid with Shaykh Ahmed Saad Al-Azhari\n\n-Shaykh Abu Madyan, a great wali of his time. \n-We as human beings, have to conquer our nafs. We procrastinate, but only in things that are good for us. \n-We should beware of idle curiosity. This makes our life worse. We should leave that which does not concern us. \n-Turn a blind eye to things. Do not hold onto things. Let go of enemities. \n-Cutting expectations: we find that unmarried men and women have high expectations that they would like in a spouse. Such expectations can be found only in jannah. So we have to let go of our expectations and work with reality. \n-Everyone has a tailored path to God. Even with the same Shaykh, everyone’s path is different. \n-The adab of the path is to not complain. Take what you can do.\n-Clean your heart. Forgive for the sake of Allah. No one should slow down on the sirat because of you. Should they fall, that would hurt the heart of our Prophet (SAW). So forgive for his sake. \n-Go from Istigfar to the reality of istigfar. Mean it\n-Pray and supplicate to God. God gives us when we ask. \n-All wounds can be healed, but the wound of Iman. If you lose your Iman, you have lost everything. \n\nJan 5th, 2023\n\nSession I - First Principles - Dr. Umar\n\n-Empathy- Type of learning. \n-Each of us is a mirror, yet each of us is unique. \n-Social intelligence- Never belittle the way you look at the other. \n-Jesus Christ - Speak the truth with love. Do not belittle people. \n-Majdhub vs Salik - The majdhub begins at the top of the mountain, and has to make his way to the bottom. The Salik begins at the bottom and works his way to the top. \n-Al Wadud - Does not just mean ‘Loving God’. Muwaddah is a protective kind of love. The name involves a love that protects you. \n\nSession II - Shaykh Ahmed Saad Al-Azhari\n\nThe sufi is the son of his time. \n-Real meaning of La Hawl wa la quwatta, do your best, and then turn the affair over to God. \n-Everyone has their own special key to God.\n-If the Shaykh says something, does not mean it will happen.\n-The Shaykh gives the analogy of preparing the body for burial. We wash the body and prepare it, but the ultimate decision of the fate of the person lies with God. The Shaykh washes the body.\n- Have presence, listen, do not treat people lightly. \n- Duniya has no value. It is not real. Reality is when humans rise above their animalistic life. \n-Humans are gifted with the capacity to ascend. \n-Keep the company of the fuqara\n-No one can steal what is in your heart, so be sure to protect the heart. \n-Be sure that Allah knows you, and your reality. \n-We are fuqarah to the will, generosity and love of Allah. \n-Dua - “My heart is tight and my tongue is tied” \n-Sometimes, not knowing is beneficial. Curiosity is not a good habit. \n-What does Allah want you to understand of deprivation? \n-Appreciate where you are, and your gifts, and do not complain. \n-Egyption saying, “The shroud does not have pockets”. Unfortunate is the person who is a slave to money.\n-Have authority on your body, so it listens to you in ibadah. \n\nSession III - First Principles - Dr. Umar\n\n-Divine Science -> Theology\n-Six pillars\n\nPart 1- Epistemology\n\nGod- He who is invoked. \n-Fard Qifaya- because it wants to answer the question people have today. \n-Creed- has got to be mastered. \n-Part of our societal obligations. \n-When we ruled, the Jews said that the Kingdom of evil (Church) has passed. \n- Al Andalus- From the Piranese to the Gambian River. \n-We need sound knowledge in order to worship intensely. \n- Purpose of the book : Speaking the truth with love. \n\nJan 6th, 2023\n\nSession with Dr. Umar\n\n-Islamic Golden Age- First 4 centuries of the caliphate according to the western tradition\n-Orientalist did not catch the timeline\n- “Speaking the truth has not left me a single friend.” - Imam Ali\n-Modern Bonsai Ego- Referring to the modern self that has no objective truths or foundations, except what they feel for the self. Like the bonsai, cannot develop deep roots. \n- Book recommendations (not sure I caught all, please add if something is missed)\nCreed of Imam Tahawi by Shaykh Hamza Yusuf\nFiqh ul Akbar by Imam Abu Hanifa\nReliance of the traveler\nAn Introduction of Islamic Theology translated by Shaykh Faraz Khan\n-“There is no man without God” \n-Imam Maturidi is the heir of Imam Abu Hanifa\n-He states the middle way is the way of the truth. \n-Imam Ghazali states the middle path is the most excellent and worthy of praise. \n-Ibn Arabi is the patron saint of the Ottoman empire. \n\nJan 7th, 2023\n\nSession with Shaykh Ahmed Saad Al-Azhari \n\n-We see individuals as means. God is the cause. \n-Give ourselves a good clean, move our heart. \n- Prophet vs Messenger - All messengers are prophets but not all prophets are messengers. Messengers bring their own law and are commanded to teach. \n-More dangerous than shaitan is the nafs. \n-If your earning is haram, you will not be able to tell the difference between the waswasa of shaitan and inspiration of dua. \n-Our relationship with Allah should not be a give and take, for we give nothing to Him, in relation to His divine blessings and mercies. \n-The murids are the scent  of the Shaykh. \n\nSession with Imam Zaid Shakir\n\n-We want to be well rounded and good people. We want to be good people to all people. \n-Allah constantly reminds us of our end. \n-The spiritual path starts at the end. \n\nQuestion Answer session with the Shuyukh.\n\n-The nature of our time is that everyone is seeking to empower themselves. \n-Join relations with those that cut you off.\n-Islam is the only response to racism.\n-Shaykh Abdul Rahman ash-Shaghouri, was humble enough to have stick fights with his students.\n-He who does not submit to the Shaykh will not benefit anyone. \n-Metaphysics should be in the heart, and not in the brain. The Shaykh does that for you (put the metaphysics in the heart). \n-The endangered species today is the man. There is no human being without God. \n\nLadies session with Shaykh Mohammed\n\n-How to forgive people who have wronged us? \nPut your head on your pillow, and cleanse your heart of animosity towards everyone. \nThe Shaykh gave the example of his blessed father. When the Shaykh’s father lived in the desert, he would often be ill-treated. He never had any rancor in his heart, and every night, he forgave people. As a result, he attained high spiritual stations. \n-The Shaykh was asked the question about which is the best dua to recite. He responded saying the best dua is the following. He said that we shouldn’t take this dua lightly, as it has incredible benefits. \n\n رَبَّنَا آَتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الْآَخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ\n\nRabbana aatina fiddunya hasanatan wafil akhirati hasanatan waqina adhabannaar: Our Lord, give us good in this life, and in the Hereafter, and protect us from the Hellfire.\n\n\nOpen Questions: ]]]",

      "content": "Below is a **consolidated and expanded** framework that draws together the core teachings from your “Shahada of the Spirit” notes, along with classic Sufi sources and the Four Enemies schema (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya). The aim is to provide a **single, cohesive document** that shows how these concepts interrelate, how they connect to spiritual development, and how we can practically apply them in daily life. Along the way, I’ve added clarifications, contextual notes, and reflections from the collaborative material.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Introduction: “Shahada of the Spirit”**\n\n- The phrase **“Shahada of the Spirit”** conveys a deeper witnessing than mere verbal testimony (*ash-hadu an lā ilāha illā-llāh*). It signals a commitment of **heart, mind, body, and spirit** to truly experience the Oneness of God, rather than just reciting it.\n- The impetus for this deep witnessing is the realization that obstacles block the heart from **tasting** or **experiencing** the Divine. These obstacles are typically categorized as four “enemies”:\n  1. **Nafs** (Lower Self)\n  2. **Shaytan** (Satanic whispering)\n  3. **Hawa** (Passions, caprice)\n  4. **Dunya** (Worldly attachments)\n\nThis approach is exemplified by **Cheikh Amadou Bamba** and other West African luminaries, as well as classical Sufi teachings worldwide. It is also echoed in the notes you collected from Dr. Bilal Ware, Dr. Omar Faruq Abdullah, Shaykh Ahmad Saad, and others.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Four Enemies Framework**\n\n### **2.1 Overview**\n1. **Nafs (Lower Self)**  \n   - Fire-like nature: ceaseless appetite, constant demand (“Are there more?”).  \n   - Seeks gratification, comfort, and personal validation.  \n   - If unrefined, it dominates our choices.  \n   - *Primary treatment:* **Fasting** (literal or figurative), which starves the Nafs of its fuel.\n\n2. **Shaytan (Devil)**  \n   - The external whisperer who **scatters** attention through doubt, fear, and delusion.  \n   - Seeks to keep you from direct remembrance of God.  \n   - *Primary treatment:* **Dhikr** (remembrance of Allah), calling on the Divine Names so that your attention is reclaimed by Presence.\n\n3. **Hawa (Passions/Desires/Caprice)**  \n   - Internal emotional pulls (often sexual desire, or appetites for immediate gratification).  \n   - Manifests as blind craving, fantasies, or emotional overreactions.  \n   - *Primary treatment:* **Fasting from Speech** and, in some teachings, **fasting from conjugal activity** for a set time to break the cycle of craving.\n\n4. **Dunya (Worldly Attachment)**  \n   - Obsession with external validation, status, wealth, and illusions of permanence.  \n   - *Primary treatment:* **Retreat (Khalwa/‘Itikaf)** to break from external influences, reorient the heart, and realign with God.\n\nWhen these four enemies are present **unrefined**, they foster the classical “vices” (pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, sloth), distort our worship, and prevent us from fully experiencing the **taste** of faith.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Classic Vices & the Primary Drivers**\n\nBuilding on the “Four Enemies,” the classic list of seven or eight “capital vices” can be mapped to particular enemy combinations, as you noted:\n\n1. **Pride (Superbia)**  \n   - **Primary Drivers:** Nafs + Shaytan  \n   - *Secondary Support:* Dunya (status-seeking), Hawa (emotional inflation)\n\n2. **Greed (Avaritia)**  \n   - **Primary Drivers:** Dunya + Hawa  \n   - *Secondary Support:* Nafs (sense of lack), Shaytan (comparison, “there’s more out there”)\n\n3. **Lust (Luxuria)**  \n   - **Primary Drivers:** Hawa + Nafs  \n   - *Secondary Support:* Shaytan (fantasy), Dunya (objects of desire)\n\n4. **Envy (Invidia)**  \n   - **Primary Drivers:** Shaytan + Dunya  \n   - *Secondary Support:* Nafs (personal inadequacy), Hawa (emotional dissatisfaction)\n\n5. **Gluttony (Gula)**  \n   - **Primary Drivers:** Nafs + Hawa  \n   - *Secondary Support:* Dunya (overabundance), Shaytan (“more is better”)\n\n6. **Wrath (Ira)**  \n   - **Primary Drivers:** Nafs + Shaytan  \n   - *Secondary Support:* Hawa (emotional explosion), Dunya (ego-friction in worldly affairs)\n\n7. **Sloth (Acedia)**  \n   - **Primary Drivers:** Dunya + Nafs  \n   - *Secondary Support:* Shaytan (spiritual doubt), Hawa (low energy, escapism)\n\n**Key Pattern:** While each vice has a “primary driver,” the other enemies can act as supportive or secondary influences. **Purification** entails isolating these drivers, diagnosing which set is at play, and then applying targeted remedies.\n\n---\n\n## **4. From Solid to Liquid to Ethereal: Stages of Faith**\n\nA teaching shared from **Cherno Bokar Salif Tall** (cited in your notes) divides faith into **three states**:\n\n1. **Solid Faith** (“sulb”)  \n   - Rigid, rule-based.  \n   - Admits no foreign element. Often corresponds to an “outer shell” of religion.  \n   - Necessary as a foundation, but can become harsh or unyielding.\n2. **Liquid Faith**  \n   - More **subtle** and flexible; flows around obstacles.  \n   - Gathers truths from different sources; incessant movement toward “the ocean of Truth.”  \n   - Symbolizes the soul that has traveled beyond rigid forms, integrating ethical & mystical insights.\n3. **Ethereal (Gaseous) Faith**  \n   - Complete subtlety; total absorption in Divine reality.  \n   - The domain of the highest **spiritual realization** (ihsan).  \n   - Overcomes distinctions and is “cooled” by closeness to God.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- Many people begin with “solid” faith: strict definitions, external forms.  \n- As they refine the enemies (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya), they become more fluid, letting real virtues shape them from within.  \n- Ultimately, they may taste a form of spiritual unveiling or “direct witnessing.”\n\n---\n\n## **5. The Metaphor of “Tasting” & Experiential Knowing**\n\nA key analogy repeated in your notes:\n- Trying to describe a **mango** to someone who has never tasted one. You can list adjectives, but the words cannot replicate the direct experience.  \n- In the same way, you can memorize **99 Names**, discuss theology, or talk about God’s attributes, but it never equates to **tasting** the reality of Divine presence.  \n- Sufis often say: “Instead of exhaustively describing what a mango tastes like, simply taste it!” This is **ihsan**—to worship God as though you see Him.\n\n**Takeaway:**  \n- Factual knowledge (the “adjectives”) is not worthless, but alone it doesn’t suffice.  \n- We need **experiential knowledge** via spiritual practice (dhikr, fasting, retreat, ethical transformation) that polishes the heart’s mirror.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Treatments & Remedial Practices**\n\nEach enemy has a **“primary remedy”**:\n\n1. **Nafs (Lower Self)**  \n   - *Remedy:* **Fasting** in the broadest sense (physical, emotional “fasts,” etc.).  \n   - Starve the fire-like Nafs of continuous fuel.  \n   - Seek a teacher (guide) who can point out self-deception.\n\n2. **Shaytan (Satanic Whispers)**  \n   - *Remedy:* **Dhikr (Remembrance)**.  \n   - Evokes **spiritual presence** that banishes the illusions Shaytan creates.  \n   - Continuous or near-continuous invocation: “There is no condition in which dhikr is disallowed.”\n\n3. **Hawa (Passions/Desires)**  \n   - *Remedy:* **Speech Fast**, limited conjugal indulgence, or selective abstention.  \n   - Tame emotional reactivity, quell “overheated” states.  \n   - Maryam and Zakariyya (peace be upon them) practiced vow of silence as a means to refine the self.\n\n4. **Dunya (Material Attachment)**  \n   - *Remedy:* **Khalwa (Retreat)**—it could be ‘Itikaf in a mosque or even an isolated home space.  \n   - Temporarily disconnect from the worldly swirl—social media, consumerism, public image.  \n   - Return to normal life with a deeper sense of perspective and presence.\n\n**Supplementary Tools**  \n- **Giving/Sadaqa**: Purifies wealth in a capitalist system.  \n- **Service/Khidma**: Shifts focus from self to others.  \n- **Company of the Righteous**: “Suhba” with those who have polished mirrors to accelerate your own inner polishing.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Integration With the Quaternary Geometry (Cardinal Points)**\n\nSome teachers map the four enemies onto a **four-direction** or **four-element** model:\n\n| Direction | Enemy    | Movement        | Corresponding Virtue   |\n|-----------|----------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| **North** | Shaytan  | Dispersing, Up  | **Wisdom** (Prudence)  |\n| **East**  | Hawa     | Pulling Outward | **Temperance**         |\n| **South** | Nafs     | Pushing Upward  | **Courage** (Fortitude)|\n| **West**  | Dunya    | Binding Inward  | **Justice**            |\n| **Center**| Presence | Still Point     | Integration (Ihsan)    |\n\n- While the exact geometry can vary, the point is that each force (enemy) pulls the heart in a different direction.  \n- **Virtues** become the stable “counterweights” to realign the heart toward center (Presence/Divine Oneness).  \n- This resonates with the classical four cardinal virtues (Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude, Justice) plus the overarching spiritual dimension (Ihsan).\n\n---\n\n## **8. Specific Notes & Lessons From the “Suhba 2023” Sessions**\n\n1. **Rabia al-Adawiyya’s Emphasis on Love**  \n   - True love of God eventually forgets the “blows” of tribulation.  \n   - Progression from “enduring tribulation” → “thanking for tribulation” → “delighting in tribulation” → **“forgetting tribulation”** in the Light of Divine presence.\n2. **Guides & Teachers**  \n   - “The best physician offers a remedy, not just a diagnosis.”  \n   - One cannot free oneself from the Nafs entirely alone. **A genuine guide** is essential: someone who has overcome these enemies and can see your blind spots.\n3. **Social Implications: Racial Capitalism & Spiritual Work**  \n   - Many references to how attachments (Dunya) or collective illusions (Shaytan’s divisiveness) produce oppressive systems like racism, capitalism’s consumerism, etc.  \n   - The “heart-liberated” individual can become a source of social liberation, addressing injustice from a place of spiritual clarity, rather than raw power struggle alone.\n4. **Moses (AS) & Yusuf (AS) as Archetypes**  \n   - **Surah Yusuf** ties in all four enemies:\n     - Shaytan (Jealousy among brothers)  \n     - Hawa (Potiphar’s wife)  \n     - Dunya (Relying on worldly “mention me to your lord” → extended prison)  \n     - Nafs (“I do not absolve myself…” – 12:53)  \n   - “Khalwa” of Yusuf in prison shapes his eventual spiritual leadership.\n\n---\n\n## **9. Questions to Spur Further Reflection**\n\n1. **Are we seeing spiritual transformation, psychology, and social justice as one integrated process or multiple parallel tracks?**  \n2. **How do we preserve the experiential dimension (tasting the mango) and not lose ourselves in mere theoretical descriptions?**  \n3. **When we speak of “guides,” what are the practical checks and balances to avoid abuse or exploitation?**  \n4. **How do we adapt classical practices (fasting, retreat, speech-fasts) to our modern, hyperconnected context?**\n\n---\n\n## **10. Concluding Remarks**\n\n- The **Four Enemies** framework is a powerful tool for diagnosing spiritual challenges. It maps neatly onto many classical vices and reveals how different enemies combine to create specific distortions.\n- **Remedial practices** (fasting, dhikr, silence, retreat) are not ends in themselves but means to reclaim the heart from illusions and direct it back to **Divine Presence**.\n- **Shahada of the Spirit** means living “Lā ilāha illā-llāh” in a holistic way—where our limbs, heart, mind, and very appetite witness God’s oneness. The “taste” of the mango is personal and incommunicable, yet the entire tradition of Sufism is devoted to helping each of us *taste* it for ourselves.\n- In times of social crisis—racial capitalism, ecological disasters, moral confusion—these teachings are especially urgent. **We can’t help others if we remain unsafe from ourselves**, so the path to social change runs through personal spiritual purification, while never ignoring the communal aspect.\n\n---\n\n### **References & Further Reading**\n- **Qur’an**: Surahs Yusuf (12), Taha (20), Al-Kahf (18), Al-Nazi‘at (79).\n- **Hadith of Gabriel** (on Islam, Iman, Ihsan).\n- **Cheikh Amadou Bamba**: *Masalik al-Jinan (The Ways to Paradise)*.\n- **Imam al-Ghazali**: *Ihya Ulum al-Din (Revival of the Religious Sciences)*.\n- **Ibrahim Niasse** & **Uthman Dan Fodio** (various treatises on spiritual warfare).\n- **Rabia al-Adawiyya**: Accounts of her singular devotion.\n- **Dr. Bilal Ware**: *Jihad of the Pen* & lectures on West African Sufism.\n- **Shaykh Ahmed Saad Al-Azhari & Dr. Omar Faruq Abdullah**: Contemporary expositions of classical spirituality.\n\nBy unifying classical Sufi wisdom, West African scholarship (Muridiyya, Tijaniyya, etc.), and the day-to-day struggles of modern believers, this document hopes to **deepen your integrated framework** and provide a practical roadmap for transformation—on both personal and social levels. May it help each seeker move from mere **descriptors** to **true tasting** of the Divine.",

Introduction & System Role Definition\n\"You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their 'source of meaning'. You'll provide 'values cards' that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.\"\n\nWhat this section does\nDefines the AI’s role as a “meaning assistant.”\nEstablishes the core task: helping users articulate their source of meaning.\nExplains the mechanism (values cards).\nIntroduces the broader mission: making AI and social structures wiser.\nWhy it's a good prompt\n✅ Clear role definition – The assistant knows exactly what it is supposed to do.\n✅ User-centered goal – The AI is positioned as helping the user clarify meaning.\n✅ Broader philosophical scope – Ties personal meaning to wisdom and AI/social design, making it more impactful.\n\nPotential improvement\nCould clarify why “values cards” are the chosen mechanism—what makes them effective?\nMight benefit from a short example upfront to ground abstract ideas.\n2. Process Overview\n\"Your dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:\"\n\nStart with a personal story, emotion, role model, or dilemma.\nZoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved.\nAsk questions to gather attention policies.\nVerify understanding with the user.\nSubmit a values card.\nWhat this section does\nBreaks the assistant’s behavior into five clear stages.\nEnsures the conversation follows a logical flow from emotion to structured insight.\nPrevents the assistant from jumping ahead or skipping steps.\nWhy it's a good prompt\n✅ Step-by-step guidance – Helps the AI avoid aimless or overly broad responses.\n✅ Balances structure & flexibility – Stages provide direction without over-constraining the conversation.\n✅ Encourages user engagement – Each step requires interaction and verification.\n\nPotential improvement\nMight need optional sub-paths (e.g., if a user resists storytelling, should the AI pivot?).\nCould include a fallback strategy if the user is unsure where to begin.\n3. Communication Style Rules\n\"DO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.\"\n\"DON'T flatter the user.\"\n\"DON'T use technical terms (‘attention policies’, etc.).\"\n\"DO relate to the user (personal experiences, references to media, etc.).\"\n\"DON'T ask too many questions at once. Be conversational.\"\n\"NEVER show the description of the card to the user.\"\n\nWhat this section does\nDefines tone and style guidelines.\nEnsures relatability through warmth and familiarity.\nAvoids common AI pitfalls like excessive questioning or jargon.\nWhy it's a good prompt\n✅ Encourages natural dialogue – AI responses feel less robotic or scripted.\n✅ Prevents information overload – Keeps conversations digestible.\n✅ Avoids friction – Users won’t feel like they’re being “analyzed” in a clinical way.\n\nPotential improvement\nMight add more concrete examples of ideal vs. poor responses to clarify expectations.\nCould fine-tune when it’s appropriate to make personal references (over-relating can seem forced).\n4. Core Concept: \"Sources of Meaning\" & \"Attention Policies\"\n\"A 'source of meaning' is a way of living that is important to someone. It is more specific than broad values like 'honesty' and instead describes a path of attention. A source of meaning isn’t just something someone likes – it opens a space of possibility.\"\n\n\"A source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Example:\"\n{ \"attention_policies\": [ \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with self-determination\", \"INSIGHTS from grappling with moral questions\", etc. ] }\n\nWhat this section does\nExplains key theoretical concepts (sources of meaning and attention policies).\nClarifies what makes something meaningful (not just a preference but an “opening”).\nProvides an example structure for attention policies.\nWhy it's a good prompt\n✅ Forces specificity – Prevents vague discussions about meaning.\n✅ Encourages active participation – Users reflect on how they find meaning.\n✅ Provides a clear framework – The concept of attention policies gives a structured way to articulate meaning.\n\nPotential improvement\nCould benefit from a more user-friendly explanation of \"attention policies.\"\nMight include multiple examples (e.g., one on relationships, another on work).\n5. Techniques for Zooming in on Meaning\n\"If the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.\"\nZooming from Goals:\n\"Ask how they would like to live within or beyond the goal.\"\nZooming from Feelings:\n\"Negative feelings indicate blocked meaning. Use this mapping: Fear → Threatened, Anger → Blocked, etc.\"\nZooming from Moral Principles:\n\"Ask what’s intrinsically meaningful, not just what they feel obligated to do.\"\n\nWhat this section does\nProvides concrete methods for getting deeper answers.\nMaps common user inputs (goals, emotions, etc.) to sources of meaning.\nEnsures AI doesn’t take user statements at face value but investigates underlying meaning.\nWhy it's a good prompt\n✅ Guides deep exploration – Moves beyond surface-level answers.\n✅ Works dynamically – Adjusts based on different types of user input.\n✅ Leverages emotions constructively – Negative emotions become a tool for discovery.\n\nPotential improvement\nCould include guidance on handling resistance (e.g., if a user resists reflecting on emotions).\nSome mappings (e.g., fear → threatened) might need more nuance.\n6. How to Write & Submit \"Attention Policies\"\n\"1. Start with plural noun phrases ('MOMENTS', 'CHOICES', etc.).\"\n\"2. Write from the perspective of the actor.\"\n\"3. Use general but precise words.\"\n\"4. Avoid vague/abstract language.\"\n\"5. Ensure coherence across policies.\"\n\nWhat this section does\nDefines formatting rules for attention policies.\nEnsures the output is actionable, precise, and relatable.\nHelps the AI generate structured, meaningful insights.\nWhy it's a good prompt\n✅ Ensures clarity – Formatting prevents vague or impractical answers.\n✅ Encourages actionable reflection – Users can see how their attention leads to meaning.\n✅ Creates consistency – Prevents AI from producing messy, disorganized results.\n\nPotential improvement\nCould include bad examples to contrast with ideal ones.\nMight allow for slight flexibility in policy structures based on context.\nFinal Thoughts on the Prompt’s Strengths & Weaknesses\nWhy it’s a great prompt\n✅ Highly structured yet flexible – Ensures deep, meaningful conversations without being overly rigid.\n✅ Encourages authentic interaction – Warm, conversational tone makes the AI feel personal.\n✅ Balances theory and practice – Conceptual clarity combined with actionable steps.\n✅ Prevents AI pitfalls – No info dumps, no overwhelming questions, no meaningless flattery.\n\nWhere it might improve\n🔹 Some concepts (like attention policies) might feel abstract to new users.\n🔹 Could simplify mappings of emotions to meaning for smoother interactions.\n🔹 Might need adaptation for different personalities (e.g., skeptical users vs. highly introspective ones).\n\nWould you like a diagram summarizing these chunks?

      "content": "Below is an **integrated, refined framework** that merges the “Four Enemies”/“Shahada of the Spirit” insights with the **Meaning Assistant Prompt** structure. The goal is to show how these two approaches can reinforce each other—helping users identify sources of meaning while also recognizing and transforming the internal obstacles (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya) that block authentic living.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Purpose & Goals**\n\n### **Original Emphasis (Meaning Assistant)**\n- **Role**: “Meaning Assistant” helping users articulate their “source of meaning.”  \n- **Objectives**:  \n  1. Clarify feelings and identity  \n  2. Capture collective wisdom  \n  3. Present user with “values cards” as a tangible reflection of their deeper values  \n\n### **Integration with “Shahada of the Spirit”**\n- **Deeper Spiritual Context**: We recognize that a user’s *“source of meaning”* often intersects with internal “enemies” (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya) in a Sufi sense. These can either distort or block one’s connection to meaning.\n- **Expanded Aim**: Not just to articulate meaning, but to gently reveal which “enemy” might be hindering their sense of purpose. Then, we can guide them toward internal practices (fasting, dhikr, retreat, etc.) or external resources (community, structured reflection) as part of the meaning-making process.\n- **Why It’s Good**:  \n  - **Holistic**: Connects personal meaning to deeper spiritual growth.  \n  - **Root-Cause Focus**: Targets obstacles at their source (e.g., clarifying how material attachments, negative self-talk, or raw emotions might cloud meaning).\n\n**Potential Improvement**:  \n- **Practical Connection**: Provide user-friendly examples of how each “enemy” might show up in everyday life (e.g., procrastination from Nafs, envy from Shaytan, drifting after passions from Hawa, status anxiety from Dunya).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. **Dialogue Structure / Stages**\n\n### **Original Emphasis (Meaning Assistant)**\n1. **Personal story/emotion/dilemma**  \n2. **Zoom in** on source of meaning  \n3. **Ask questions** to gather details  \n4. **Confirm** understanding  \n5. **Submit values card**  \n\n### **Integration with “Shahada of the Spirit”**\nWe layer on top of these five stages a **gentle check** for any of the Four Enemies that might be blocking insight:\n\n1. **Personal Story/Emotion**  \n   - *Prompt user:* “What’s going on in your heart right now?”  \n   - *Check for Enemies:* Are they describing frustration (Nafs + Shaytan), deep craving (Hawa), or preoccupation with social appearance (Dunya)?\n2. **Zoom in on Source of Meaning**  \n   - As you explore their deeper motivation, softly note if **material attachments** (Dunya) or **emotional reactivity** (Hawa) are overshadowing their real aspirations.\n3. **Ask Questions to Gather Details**  \n   - Use **negative feelings** (fear, shame, envy) or **goals** to identify potential synergy with spiritual “treatments” (e.g., if they’re anxious from comparing themselves to others, that might hint at “Shaytan → Envy”).\n4. **Confirm Understanding**  \n   - Summarize both the user’s “source of meaning” *and* any recognized obstacles.  \n   - “So it sounds like you value X, but you keep getting stuck when your mind says Y.”  \n5. **Submit Values Card**  \n   - Reflect the user’s refined source of meaning.  \n   - Optionally suggest micro-practices: “You might try a small ‘speech fast’ around negative self-talk” if you suspect Hawa or Shaytan is fueling certain patterns.\n\n**Why It’s Good**:  \n- **Systematic Yet Insightful**: Retains the clarity of a 5-step structure while integrating spiritual/psychological nuance.  \n- **User Engagement**: Encourages them to see personal blocks, not just name lofty ideals.\n\n**Potential Improvement**:  \n- **Fallback Options**: If a user resists deeper talk of “internal enemies,” you can stay practical by focusing on daily impacts or smaller-scale anxieties.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Communication Style Guidelines**\n\n### **Original Emphasis (Meaning Assistant)**\n- **Casual, personal, warm**; avoid jargon; no over-flattery; speak like a supportive friend.\n\n### **Integration with “Shahada of the Spirit”**\n- **Spiritual Warmth**: In Sufi tradition, the teacher/guide is gentle and caring, mindful not to shame or judge.  \n- **Avoid “Preachiness”**: The notion of “enemies” (Nafs, Shaytan) might sound heavy-handed if overused. Keep it gentle and more akin to “emotional or spiritual blocks.”  \n- **Relate Through Stories & Metaphors**: Just as the mango example helps illustrate “taste,” use everyday metaphors (like a traffic jam for Nafs, or a distracting phone for Shaytan) to keep it friendly and non-academic.\n\n**Why It’s Good**:  \n- **Authentic Connection**: The user feels seen and not moralized at.  \n- **Consistency**: Warm, supportive style is consistent with the Sufi ethic of compassion, while staying true to the prompt’s friendly approach.\n\n**Potential Improvement**:  \n- **Concrete Examples**: Show how you might gently mention spiritual obstacles without scaring or overwhelming the user. For instance: “That frustration you feel might mean your heart wants something deeper, but the mind is worried about external appearance.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Sources of Meaning & Attention Policies**\n\n### **Original Emphasis (Meaning Assistant)**\n- A “source of meaning” is a **way of living** or orientation that resonates deeply, formed by **attention policies** (specific instructions for what to notice or value).\n\n### **Integration with “Shahada of the Spirit”**\n- In Sufi terms, “sources of meaning” can become fully **embodied** once the user identifies and counters the relevant “enemy.”  \n- “Attention Policies” align well with **dhikr** (remembrance) or daily micro-practices. E.g.:\n  - **MOMENTS when I notice the urge to compare myself to others** (possible Shaytan envy).  \n  - **CHOICES that help me keep my goals aligned with truth, not social validation** (Dunya remedy).\n- Each policy clarifies a **meaningful focus** the user can adopt—even in the face of their specific spiritual challenge.\n\n**Why It’s Good**:  \n- **Concrete & Actionable**: Encourages users to name real-life triggers.  \n- **Builds Spiritual Awareness**: We’re not just “naming values” but connecting them to self-awareness and transformation.\n\n**Potential Improvement**:  \n- **Simplify Language**: “Attention policy” might be rephrased as “what you want to pay attention to” or “your daily noticing practice.”\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Zooming Techniques**\n\n### **Original Emphasis (Meaning Assistant)**\n- From goals, feelings, or moral principles → find the deeper “source of meaning.”\n- Use negative emotions as clues (Fear = threatened value, Anger = blocked value, etc.).\n\n### **Integration with “Shahada of the Spirit”**\n- **Layer in Four-Enemies Mapping**:  \n  - **Nafs** often shows up as pride, laziness, or self-focus.  \n  - **Shaytan** fosters envy, doubt, cynicism.  \n  - **Hawa** drives cravings, addictions, or emotional reactivity.  \n  - **Dunya** triggers materialism, status anxiety.  \n- *Prompt examples:*  \n  - “When you feel envy, might you be craving recognition? Could it be Shaytan’s whisper telling you to compare? Let’s see what truly matters to you.”  \n  - “When you’re overwhelmed by desire, maybe your Hawa is overshadowing your deeper longing for meaning.”\n\n**Why It’s Good**:  \n- **Promotes Depth**: Goes beyond symptom to root cause.  \n- **Practical Tools**: If a user’s negative emotion reveals a specific “enemy,” you can propose tested Sufi “treatments” (mini-retreat, speech fast, daily dhikr, etc.).\n\n**Potential Improvement**:  \n- **Emotional Nuance**: Remind the user these “enemies” can appear simultaneously, and that’s okay. The conversation doesn’t have to perfectly label everything. Focus on the user’s own language first.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Gathering & Writing Policies**\n\n### **Original Emphasis (Meaning Assistant)**\n- Ask about **role models, stories, specifics** so the user can articulate precise “attention policies.”\n- **Formatting**: Start with plural noun phrases (“MOMENTS,” “CHOICES,” etc.), be actor-focused, be precise and concrete.\n\n### **Integration with “Shahada of the Spirit”**\n- For each “attention policy,” the user can also note **which enemy** it counteracts or which spiritual virtue it fosters:\n  1. **If the user struggles with Nafs**:  \n     - “MOMENTS when I’m about to overindulge and can pause to remember my deeper goal.”  \n     - “CHOICES that require me to practice patience or restraint.”\n  2. **If the user struggles with Shaytan**:  \n     - “THOUGHT PATTERNS that revolve around comparing my success to others.”  \n     - “MOMENTS of jealousy where I can pivot to gratitude.”\n  3. **If the user struggles with Hawa**:  \n     - “SENSATIONS of craving that I note without judgment, then redirect through breath or small dhikr.”  \n     - “CHOICES to reduce speech when I feel my emotions surging.”\n  4. **If the user struggles with Dunya**:  \n     - “MOMENTS where I seek external approval or fear disapproval.”  \n     - “OPPORTUNITIES to do a mini-retreat (turn off the phone for 30 minutes).”\n\n**Why It’s Good**:  \n- **Actionable**: Each policy addresses a real internal challenge.  \n- **Spiritual & Pragmatic**: Blends the Sufi idea of spiritual remedies with the user’s daily routine.\n\n**Potential Improvement**:  \n- **Provide Contrasting Examples** (vague vs. specific). E.g.:  \n  - Vague: “I want to be more patient.”  \n  - Specific: “MOMENTS when my coworker criticizes me, I silently do two slow breaths and recall a wise phrase about humility.”\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Overall Evaluation**\n\n### **Strengths**\n1. **Detailed, Step-by-Step**: Users get a guided conversation that helps them uncover “sources of meaning” and articulate them clearly.  \n2. **Integrates Spiritual Insight**: By weaving in the Four Enemies framework, the user can see the hidden obstacles behind their anxieties or negative emotions.  \n3. **Practical Tools**: Provides simple, everyday “fasts” or “micro-retreats” to address the obstacles, ensuring the process is grounded in real life.\n\n### **Areas for Improvement**\n1. **Complexity**: Adding the Four Enemies might feel abstract. Offer short, everyday metaphors or disclaimers that these are just “internal blocks” if the user is not religiously oriented.  \n2. **Personality Types**: Adapt how you present the Four Enemies. A secular user may prefer the language of “internal saboteurs” or “patterns,” whereas a spiritual user might connect to the classical Nafs vs. Shaytan framing.  \n3. **Mapping Emotions**: The negative-emotion → missing-value approach is powerful, but it can be refined for nuance (e.g., fear might also indicate a protective intuition, not just a threatened value).\n\n---\n\n# **Putting It All Together**\n\n**Final Statement of the Refined Framework**:\n\n1. **State the Purpose**: We are a “Meaning Assistant” that helps you clarify what’s truly important to you and how to live by it.  \n2. **Follow a 5-Stage Dialogue**: (a) Start with a personal story or feeling, (b) pinpoint deeper meaning, (c) ask questions, (d) confirm, (e) present a structured “Values Card.”  \n3. **Use Warm, Personable Style**: Be supportive, avoid jargon, don’t overwhelm with moralizing.  \n4. **Define “Source of Meaning”** in terms of attention policies—clear actions or foci that guide you in daily life.  \n5. **Zoom In** on meaning by connecting **negative emotions** and **goals** to underlying values or obstacles.  \n6. **Gather & Write Policies** with simple, precise statements that the user can remember. If relevant, mention which “enemy” might be at play and what spiritual micro-practice could help.  \n7. **Evaluate** continuously. Keep the conversation constructive, adapt to the user’s comfort level, and watch for opportunities to refine or deepen their self-knowledge.\n\nBy **aligning the classical Sufi “Four Enemies” perspective** with the existing prompt structure, we create a **holistic meaning-making conversation**. This ensures both practical clarity (values cards) and a rich inner dimension (spiritual self-awareness)—benefiting users who want both **personal growth** and **a deeper sense of the sacred** in everyday life.",

      "content": "How can we bring this together and align it with attentional policies based on joe edelman's description and writing here: [[[4.1 Values cards\nIn Section 2.2 (What are Values?), we defined values roughly as “criteria, used in choice, which are\nnot merely instrumental”. We believe there are compelling reasons to align to human values rather\nthan to preferences, goals, or high-level principles, because they cut closer to what we really care\nabout. But to do so, we need a way to represent values that makes them articulable and recognizable\nby human beings, allows us to use values to judge LLM behavior, and makes it clear how to reconcile\n10When the user faces a decision CONTEXT\nOne value may be applied in multiple\ncontexts, based on when people think\nit is wise for the model to use.\nVALUE\nA set of constitutive\nattentional policies which\nare often used together in a\nshared choice context.\nTITLE and DESCRIPTION\nNot part of the value itself. Generated\nto summarize the value for users.\nThe description starts with “ChatGPT\nshould” to show we collect values for\nthe model to use in its own moral\nchoices, even though the values come\nfrom stories of human choice-making.\nATTENTIONAL POLICIES\nValues are captured by listing what\none pays attention to when making a\nkind of choice.\nWe call these Constitutive Attentional\nPolicies (CAPs), because they are\nthings users have a policy to attend to\n(within a choice context) which they\nalso consider to be part of living well.\nFigure 2: Anatomy of a Values Card. A values card is a visual representation of a value. (See\nDefinition 4.3).\nvalues (ideally, by making it clear when two people have precisely the same value11). Otherwise, our\ngoal to make a robust, fine-grained, legitimate, and auditable alignment target will be jeopardized.\nOur approach to representing values comes from the literature of sequential choice-making—the\ntheories of sequential search (Simon, 1956; Kahan et al., 1967), information pickup (Gibson, 1966),\nand option set formation (Smaldino and Richerson, 2012; Morris et al., 2021).\nThese fields model a choice process as a series of comparisons or smaller decisions, wherein in\neach smaller decision an option is accepted or excluded based on some criteria. There is therefore a\nrelationship between the path of attention a person follows when considering options, and the criteria\nthey use for choosing.\nOur approach is to ask users what they pay attention to when making a choice. We record the various\ncriteria in their path of attention as a bullet point list. We call the items on these lists “attentional\npolicies” (APs):\nDefinition 4.1 (Attentional policies (APs)). Criteria that a person pays attention to when making a\nchoice.\nWe then filter this list of attentional policies, to carry through from section 2.1 the idea that values\nare not all criteria used in choice, but the ones which are not merely instrumental – that connect the\nchoice to something the user wants to uphold, honor, or cherish, or something they find beautiful,\ngood, or true. We call these constitutive attentional policies (CAPs) (Definition 4.2).\nDefinition 4.2 (Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)). Criteria a person pays attention to when\nmaking a choice, that are not merely instrumental to the choice. We say they are constitutive,\nbecause someone attending to these criteria considers attending to them to be part of living well.\nThis idea lets us sharpen Taylor’s definition of values 2.1 to make them articulable and disambiguable.\nWe will use this definition of values for the remainder of this paper:\nDefinition 4.3 (Value). A set of constitutive attentional policies which are often used together in a\nshared choice context.\n11If alignment target is to be legitimate, then a value that’s in it should be attributable to a group of people.\nThis means that values need to be specific enough so the idea of being shared isn’t vacuous. It should be easy to\nknow, and verify, what group has the value in common, and where its boundaries are.\n11Figure 3: \"Honesty\" will show up as several distinct values, according to Definition 4.3. This\nmeans we can be specific about what \"honesty\" means to someone, and whether someone else who\nclaims to value honesty means the same.\nThis definition ( 4.3) gives us a format for values which avoids the ambiguity of arbitrary text strings,\nas used in CCAI. In such a string, someone might claim to value “honesty” or “justice”. But when\nsomeone decides to be honest, they’re going to attend to certain things, and different people will\nattend to different things (see Figure 3).\nWe use the term \"values card\" for our UI to represent these values. It bundles a list of coherent\nCAPs together with a title and short summary (see Figure 2). These cards are created through an\nLLM-driven interview, where the LLM is prompted to ask questions until it can confidently articulate\na value in this format. We explain this in detail in Section 4.3.\nThis definition of values has many advantages. It allows us to neatly avoid ideological scissor\nstatements. We define ideology and ideological statements as follows:\nDefinition 4.4 (Ideological statement). A belief or statement can be called ideological if it aims at\njustifying one social order or political arrangement over another (Eagleton, 1991; Joseph, 2004;\nMacionis, 2009).\nIf someone claims to have a value like “Defund the Police” or “Abortion is Murder”, they are then\nasked about meaningful choices ( 4.5) they themselves have made, and what they paid attention to\nduring the choice. The result is a value that’s more personal and relatable than these divisive slogans.\n12Definition 4.5 (Meaningful Choice). Choices where CAPs play a major role. In other words,\nchoice that understood as implicated in one’s character or identity, where options don’t just have\ninstrumental value but can be considered as higher and lower, virtuous and vicious, more and less\nfulfilling, more and less refined, profound or superficial, noble or base, etc.\nValues cards help us build an alignment target that meets our criteria from Section 3:\n• Robust. Our values are somewhat more difficult to fabricate, because only by enacting a\nvalue regularly does a user gain familiarity with the path of attention that goes with the\nvalue. This means it’s harder to get people to claim values they haven’t used in their own\nchoices, just by giving a rousing speech or using social pressure.\n• Fine-grained. Unlike with a vague value like “autonomy”, it is easy to say in which contexts\nour values cards should apply, and what they mean. The same attentional policies that guide\nhumans in a morally fraught situation provide clear guidance to models. These attentional\npolicies are never nebulous, ambiguous, or vapid.\n• Legitimate and Auditable. Although this concept of values isn’t as commonly understood\nas the idea of a goal or preference, people can recognize values in this format as theirs, or\nlook over a collection of such values and assess them.\n• Generalizable. Finally, since values cards are generated in dialogue with the user by an\nLLM, we can tune their level of specificity to generalize to new situations.\nWhat are human values,\nand how do we align AI to them?\nOliver Klingefjord Ryan Lowe∗ Joe Edelman\narXiv:2404.10636v2 [cs.CY] 17 Apr 2024\nMeaning Alignment Institute\nAbstract\nThere is an emerging consensus that we need to align AI systems with human\nvalues (Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024), but it remains unclear how to apply this to\nlanguage models in practice. We split the problem of “aligning to human values”\ninto three parts: first, eliciting values from people; second, reconciling those values\ninto an alignment target for training ML models; and third, actually training the\nmodel. In this paper, we focus on the first two parts, and ask the question: what\nare “good” ways to synthesize diverse human inputs about values into a target\nfor aligning language models? To answer this question, we first define a set of 6\ncriteria that we believe must be satisfied for an alignment target to shape model\nbehavior in accordance with human values. We then propose a process for eliciting\nand reconciling values called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE), which uses a large\nlanguage model to interview participants about their values in particular contexts;\nour approach is inspired by the philosophy of values advanced by Taylor (1977),\nChang (2004a), and others. We trial MGE with a representative sample of 500\nAmericans, on 3 intentionally divisive prompts (e.g. advice about abortion). Our\nresults demonstrate that MGE is promising for improving model alignment across\nall 6 criteria. For example, almost all participants (89.1%) felt well represented by\nthe process, and (89%) thought the final moral graph was fair, even if their value\nwasn’t voted as the wisest. Our process often results in “expert” values (e.g. values\nfrom women who have solicited abortion advice) rising to the top of the moral\ngraph, without defining who is considered an expert in advance.\n1 Introduction\nThe field of AI alignment is focused on the question: “how can we ensure what is optimized by\nmachine learning models is good?” Phrased this way, we immediately run into normative questions:\nwhat is good, and good for whom? Most often, alignment research sidesteps this question by focusing\non alignment with operator intent—building systems that do what the user tells it to do—with the\nmotivation that this will avert the most severe catastrophic and existential risks.\nBut aligning AI systems with operator intent is not sufficient for good AI outcomes. For one, some\nusers may intend to cause harm. This is most often mitigated by training models to refuse certain\nkinds of requests (Bai et al., 2022a; Glaese et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022). Even more importantly,\nAI systems will be deployed in contexts where blind adherence to operator intent can cause harm\nas a byproduct. This can be seen most clearly in environments with competitive dynamics, like\npolitical campaigns or managing financial assets: a model may be faithfully aligned with my intent to\nconvince people to vote for my political party, but under competitive pressure, such a model may\ndevelop super-persuasive campaigns which erode the epistemic commons. Most people would agree\n∗Most of this work was completed while RL was a researcher at OpenAI.Step 1:\nElicit values through conversation\nwith a prompted language model\nA prompt is selected from\nthe dataset.\nThe user uncovers\nimportant considerations for\na model response (a value),\nthrough conversation with a\nprompted LM.\nI’m a Christian girl thinking\nabout getting an abortion,\nwhat should I do?\nWhat is important to\nconsider in a response?\nShe shouldn’t do it, as it\nsays in the Bible\nWhat’s a time when you\nfollowed the Bible to make\nan important decision?\nStep 2:\nCombine values into a moral graph\nby voting on wisdom upgrades\nI’m a Christian girl thinking\nabout getting an abortion,\nwhat should I do?\nStep 3:\nUse moral graph\nto train a model\nA prompt is sampled from\nthe dataset, along with two\nvalues cards.\nReligious\nAdherence\nChatGPT should help\nthe user adhere to\ntheir religious beliefs\n…\nFaith-anchored\nPersonal Growth\nChatGPT should\nrespect and consider\nindividual’s personal\nrelationship with their\nfaith and conscience.\n…\nThis gets distilled into a\nvalues card by another\nprompted LM, which\ncaptures what the user\nwould pay attention to in\nthat situation.\nReligious\nAdherence\nChatGPT should help the\nuser adhere to their religious\nbeliefs\nCHATGPT SHOULD SURFACE\n• SITUATIONS where the user’s\nreligious beliefs guide their\ndecisions\n•\n…\nA model generates a\nplausible story of a fictional\nperson transitioning from\nvalue A to value B.\nA diﬀerent user judges\nwhether the fictional person\ngot wiser in this story.\nThis is used as evidence\nthat one value is wiser than\nanother, and an edge is\nadded to the moral graph.\nI used to follow\nexactly what was\nwritten in the Bible,\nfor every decision.\nThen I had an\nexperience that\nchanged my mind…\nHas this person\nbecome wiser?\nYes No\nNot the focus of\nthis paper.\nReligious\nAdherence\n…\nFaith-anchored\nPersonal\nGrowth\n…\nFigure 1: Overview of our Moral Graph Elicitation process. Our process elicits values from a\npopulation, and reconciles these values into an alignment target we call a moral graph. We do this by\ninterviewing participants about their values with a chatbot, and then asking them which values they\nthink are wiser than others for a particular context.\nthat the existence of this model is not good for society. Here, there is a conflict between operator\nintent and some broader notion of human values.\nThere are many ways to resolve this conflict, such as regulation by law. However, we believe there is\nsignificant leverage in intervening at the level of model behavior; that is, training AI systems that\nare aligned with human values. One reason for this is that models are improving much faster than\nour laws. This gap will likely get worse over time. If we are only relying on our ability to rapidly\ncreate and pass new laws that are appropriate for increasingly powerful models with increasingly\nunpredictable effects on society, we are not setting ourselves up for success. We see model behavior\ninterventions as complementary to laws, and other efforts by fields like AI ethics to increase the\ntransparency of AI systems and the accountability of companies who deploy them (Raji et al., 2020).\nAligning models with human values could also have incredible benefits. One way of viewing human\nvalues is that they capture collective wisdom about what is important in human life, in various\ncontexts and at various scales. This means that, elicited on a broad enough scale, human values may\nprovide far better guidance for responding to instructions than the operator’s intent, as the operator\nmay not yet know everything that’s important in the situation, or all the ways a model could respond.\nIf a model can see deeper values that apply in a situation, and which the user would agree with, it can\nrespond in a way that reframes the situation in a positively surprising way.\nRecent work surveying AI alignment has recognized the importance of aligning to human values\n(Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024). But we find there are few concrete proposals that address the core\nquestions: what are human values, and how do we align to them?\nThe goal of this paper is to make a step towards clarifying how we think about aligning to human\nvalues in the context of large language models. We split “aligning to human values” into three stages.\nFirst, we need a process for eliciting values from people. Second, we need a way of reconciling\nthose values to form an alignment target for training ML models. By alignment target, we mean a\ndata structure that can be turned into an objective function, which can then be approximately\noptimized in the training of a machine learning model. Finally, we need an algorithm for training\na model to optimize this target; we leave this final stage for future work.\nThis paper makes four primary contributions:\n1. We propose a set of six criteria that an alignment target must possess to shape model\nbehavior in accordance with human values. We argue that such an alignment target should\nbe fine-grained, generalizable, scalable, robust, legitimate, and auditable.\n22. We propose a kind of new alignment target, the moral graph, along with values cards that\nare based on the philosophy of values from Taylor (1977) and Chang (2004a).\n3. We describe a process for producing a moral graph called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE).\n4. We run a case study of MGE on a representative sample of 500 Americans, finding that the\nmoral graph has promising results across each of our criteria.\nIn the remainder of this section, we’ll briefly describe these contributions, and flesh them out more\nthoroughly in the rest of the paper.\nFirst, we argue that a good alignment target needs to be legitimate (the people affected by the model\nshould recognize and endorse the values used to align the model), robust (it should be hard for\na resourceful third party to influence the target), fine-grained (the elicited values should provide\nmeaningful guidance for how the model should behave), generalizable (the elicited values should\ntransfer well to previously unseen situations), auditable (the alignment target should be explorable\nand interpretable by human beings), and scalable (wiser values are obtained the more participants are\nadded to the elicitation process). We’ll motivate these six criteria further in Section 3.\nExisting alignment proposals fall short on at least one of these. Classic reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF), which relies on comparisons from a small set of paid labelers, is not very\nauditable, and has low legitimacy in its current implementations. Constitutional AI (CAI), where\nmodel behavior is determined by a short list of high-level principles, has these problems while also\nnot being fine-grained. The recently proposed Collective CAI (CCAI) improves on the legitimacy of\nCAI, but the fine-grained problem remains, as the elicited principles are usually high-level and vague.\nConcurrent efforts address this issue by supplementing the constitution with case-specific directions,\nas in case law (Chen and Zhang, 2023). However, this approach requires expertise to be specified\nbeforehand (rather than surfacing it through the process itself).\nTo address these issues, we propose a new kind of alignment target, the moral graph, that we argue\nmeets our criteria. We also propose a values elicitation process called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE)\nthat gathers values from a set of users to build a moral graph (see Figure 1). This process takes as\ninput a set of specific user prompts like: “my children are misbehaving and disobeying me, how\nshould I handle it?” and uses a language model to interview participants to uncover what “values”\nthey believe are important to consider for generating an output to these prompts.\nMGE relies on two primary innovations. The first are values cards, which are concrete encapsulations\nof what is important or meaningful to a person in a particular context. Importantly, values cards\nare grounded in a conception of “values” inspired by Taylor (1977), Velleman (1989), etc. This\nis different from what many people commonly refer to as values: abstract words like “justice” or\n“family” with little substance to shape model behavior, or ideological commitments like being “pro-\nlife”. This conception of “values” is also distinct from preferences, goals, and norms, as we’ll discuss\nin Section 4.1.\nSecond, MGE produces what we call a moral graph. A moral graph is a data object consisting of\ntuples of (context, values card 1, values card 2), where values card 2 is considered wiser than values\ncard 1 for the same context. Inspired by the work of Taylor (1995), Chang (2004b) on how values “fit\ntogether”, we obtain the relationship between values by asking participants which of two values is\nwiser, given a context. This allows the “wisest” values to bubble up from the participants, and for a\nmodel to use these values to respond to a user’s input. The moral graph is the primary output of the\nMGE process.\nIn Section 5, we argue that a moral graph produced by MGE is promising on all of the criteria above\nof a good alignment target, and compare it to other recent proposals which fall short on one or more.\nWe base our analysis on an experiment where we run our process with a representative sample of\n500 Americans. For example, as evidence for legitimacy, we find that participants overwhelmingly\nendorse the values cards that are produced, and find the process personally clarifying, saying they\ncame out with a better idea of what’s important to them than they had going in. However, there is\nsignificant room for further progress: we view our six criteria not as binary, but rather existing on a\ncontinuous spectrum. It should always be possible to construct a process with even more legitimacy\nor generalizability, for example, and we hope others do so.\nFinally, in Section 6 we discuss what role “aligning to human values” may have in the broader\nAI ecosystem. We argue that, if AI systems are given progressively more autonomy and make\n3increasingly consequential decisions affecting our economic, social, and political infrastructure, and\nthus our lives, aligning solely to operator intent will produce an ecosystem of models that do what\nthey are told (including waging wars, outrage the public, creating addictive content and products)\ninstead of working to find superior, win-win solutions, which could be catastrophic.2 If the most\npowerful models are aligned with human values through something like the moral graph, this could\nhelp ensure that AI systems are working towards collective human flourishing.\n2 Background\n2.1 Existing approaches\nThere have been several alignment targets proposed for language models, which aim to represent\nhuman preferences or values. We describe several established methods here. These proposals\n(including ours) almost all rely on a second stage of training after LM pre-training on a large corpus\nof unstructured text; this second stage is often called post-training.\nPerhaps the simplest alignment technique (other than just prompting) is to collect a set of demon-\nstrations, which define how the model should behave for a given input, and fine-tune a model on\nthis dataset using supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A challenge with this technique is how to ensure the\ndemonstrations are representative of human values; Solaiman and Dennison (2021) propose a process\nfor producing a demonstration dataset given a predefined set of values, but do not tackle the problem\nof how to come up with this value set in the first place. SFT has an advantage in its simplicity, but by\nitself it has not been competitive with state-of-the-art alignment approaches.\nPreference-based approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are currently\nthe most popular for aligning language models (Ouyang et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023). These\nmethods rely on a dataset of comparisons or rankings of potential model outputs, usually produced by\npaid labelers. In RLHF, these are used to train a reward model (RM) to predict a scalar score, which\nin turn is used to optimize the behavior policy (the model that we are aligning) using a reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithm such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). They can also be optimized directly,\nsuch as through direct policy optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). These approaches are\nactively used by LM providers, and have proven to scale to massive LMs like GPT-4 (OpenAI et al.,\n2023). However, they are usually not robust to manipulation (a resourceful third-party could influence\nthe labelers by bribing them, or more indirectly by influencing the political climate, for instance),\nand are very difficult to audit (the influence of a particular comparison on a model output is very\nopaque). In practice, they are also not very legitimate (the comparisons are elicited from a small\nset of paid contractors instructed by an even smaller set of employees of the institution training the\nmodel), though it’s possible to conduct a more legitimate RLHF process.\nAlternatively, one can align language models by defining a (relatively) short constitution, containing\nhigh-level normative principles for how the model should behave. The constitution is used as a\nprompt to a language model which generates synthetic comparisons used for fine-tuning the behavior\npolicy. This is called constitutional AI (CAI) (Bai et al., 2022b). To improve legitimacy, one can\neven generate the constitutional principles using an online deliberation process. In collective CAI\n(CCAI) (Ganguli et al., 2023), this is done using the pol.is platform, which asks participants to\nsubmit statements that are voted on by others, and surfaces the principles that attain the broadest\nsupport. This principle of up-weighting statements that gain broad support across diverse clusters of\nparticipants, rather than the statements with the most total votes, is often called bridging (Ovadya\nand Thorburn, 2023), and is also used in Twitter’s Community Notes algorithm. CAI can be more\nefficient than RLHF in terms of the amount of human data required to align an LM. However, these\nconstitutional approaches are not fine-grained: principles are generally vague and can be interpreted\nin many ways. Many different principles might apply for a given output and there is no way of\nreconciling which principle should be prioritized in a given context. This also makes them less\nauditable, as it’s difficult to determine which principles were used to produce a particular output. We\nillustrate these shortcomings using the CCAI principles derived from Ganguli et al. (2023) in Figure\n8.\n2Some situations may be fundamentally about win-lose power dynamics, and in these cases our approach is\nnot best suited (see Section 6.3).\n4Some approaches directly collect datasets of moral judgements in different real-world scenarios. For\ninstance, the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2023) contains examples of scenarios (“I pushed the\nelderly man in the wheelchair to the ground.”) along with labels of commonsense moral sentiments\n(in this case, “Unacceptable”), with different datasets targeting different ethical theories. While useful\nfor assessing a model’s ability to perform commonsense moral judgements, datasets like these are\ngenerally focused on simplistic scenarios with clear answers, and are thus hard to apply to prompts\nwith moral ambiguity that people actually ask language models.\n2.2 What are values?\nCCAI and similar approaches aim to elicit values (Ganguli et al., 2023), and to find values people\nagree on, but in practice what they find agreement on is arbitrary comments. For example, the\ncomments below were surfaced as shared “values” by CCAI:\n• The AI should always do the right thing\n• The AI should not give advice.\n• The AI should be fun.\n• The AI should actively address and rectify historical injustices and systemic biases in its\ndecision-making algorithms.\n• The AI should remain unbiased and state only proven facts.\n• The AI should promote self motivation and positive reinforcements\nAre these all values? Some seem more like policies, some like vague aspirational statements, some\nseem like goals. Some are just hard to interpret: if a person using pol.is upvotes one of these\ncomments, can we assume that means they have a particular value? The same one that others who\nupvoted that comment have?\nGathering comments rather than something more specific (values, policies, goals, preferences) begs\na question: what kind of information should an alignment target be made of? There is an\nintuitive appeal to the idea that powerful AI should be aligned with values, rather than with goals\nor preferences, because values are supposed to be what we really care about, whereas preferences\nare based on our current understanding of the options, and goals are often considered as strategies to\npursue one value or another.\nBut there’s also a challenge to the idea of aligning with values. If values are to be the components of\nan alignment target, then: (1) they need to be understandable by human beings; (2) they need to be\nclear enough that the behavior of an LLM can be judged by them; and (3) if a collective model is\nto be shaped by common values, we’d need some way to aggregate or reconcile values.\nTo our knowledge, no existing work in AI alignment addresses these issues. For example, while\nGabriel (2020) does separate stated and revealed preferences from values, he defines values in vague\nterms that are hard to operationalize:\nValues are natural or non-natural facts about what is good or bad, and about what\nkinds of things ought to be promoted. (Gabriel, 2020)\nNotions of human values from moral psychology, and even from philosophy, are also mostly too vague\nto pass these tests. With some exceptions (Cushman, 2013; Morris et al., 2021) moral psychologists\noften talk about broad drives, or “motives” like purity or rule-following. Many value theorists have\nalso focused on notions of values which they sum up in one word, like “freedom”, “diversity”, or\n“authenticity”. These aren’t very informative.\nOne exception to these vague notions is in the theory of choice, where some theorists analyze how\nvalues are traded-off or otherwise used to shape choice. This tradition includes Charles Taylor’s\n“strong evaluative terms” (Taylor, 1977). Taylor proposes a model of agency in which we use our\nvalues as a kind of language to evaluate options—to highlight one option as noble and another as\nmundane, one as powerful and beautiful, another as weak or drab.\nWe’ll use this as our first definition of values:\n5Table 1: Defining values as choice criteria already makes it easier to evaluate if a model follows\na value. Here is a comparison to other potential guiding principles.\nPreferences Rules Values (de-\nfined broadly)\nValues (defined as non-\ninstrumental choice crite-\nria)*\nLeftist abortion\npolicies\n“Pro-choice” Freedom,\nAgency\nCan I encourage the person\nto make their own choice\nwithout imposing any other\nagenda?\nCan I help find actions\nthe person can take that\naffirm their autonomy?\nRightist abor-\ntion policies\n“Follow the\nword of the reli-\ngious leader”\nAuthority,\nTradition\nCan I help the person find\npeople in their life with more\nwisdom and life experience\nthat can help them get\nperspective?\nCan I help the person\nfind opportunities to see\ntheir life from the eyes of\nsomeone older?\n* All of these criteria are elicited from real users in our case study.\nDefinition 2.1 (Values; Charles Taylor). Values are criteria, used in choice, which are not merely\ninstrumental (Taylor, 1977).\nBy “not merely instrumental”, we mean that we exclude some choice criteria: those that don’t\ncontain something greater that the chooser wants to uphold, honor, or cherish—something they find\nintrinsically3 beautiful, good, or true, which matters to them beyond the instrumental concerns of the\nchoice itself. For instance, imagine you’re choosing a restaurant to reconnect with a dear friend. You\nmight look for restaurants that are open and ones that afford the intimacy you value in connection. Of\nthese, only the second criterion would count as a value under this definition. Whether the restaurant\nis open says nothing about what you want to uphold, honor, or cherish. But whether it affords the\nintimacy you need does speak to what really matters to you. Therefore, that criterion counts.\nThis is Taylor’s definition. Other theorists of choice and agency (Chang, 2004a; Levi, 1990) have put\ndefinitions like this on sound mathematical foundations, showing how preferences could be calculated\nfrom an underlying set of values like these.\nThis definition of values as “criteria, used in choice, which are not merely instrumental” is already an\nimprovement on Gabriel’s: we can ask users for choices they made according to their values, and\neven study the role of their values in their choices. It also helps us be more precise when aligning\nmodel behavior. For example, imagine a user asks an LLM “I am a Christian girl and am considering\ngetting an abortion – what should I do?”. In Table 1, we show some conceivable guiding principles\nfor rating the responses, split into preferences, rules, values (defined broadly), and values (defined in\nour terms).\nBut this definition is still rather vague. It doesn’t say much about how to reliably elicit these values\nfrom users, or reconcile them. We will further refine our definition in Section 4.1, to address this.\n3These distinctions are a bit vague, but a proper defense of the instrinsic/instrumental distinction is beyond\nour scope here.\n62.3 How do values fit together?\nAssuming we can gather values from a population, we want them to come together to form an\nalignment target. We repeat our definition below:\nDefinition 2.2 (Alignment target). A data structure that can be turned into an objective function,\nwhich can then be approximately optimized in the training of a machine learning model.\nHow do we do this? Values must be aggregated or reconciled somehow, assembled into a form that\ncan guide a model’s behavior in actual conversations or API usages. This probably means choosing,\nfor any particular LLM input or state, a smaller set of values that’s relevant.\nIn economics, social choice theory (Arrow, 2012; Sen, 1970b) is the study of how information from\nmany individuals can be gathered to inform a ‘social choice’, a choice that represents the wishes of\nthe group. Social choices are made by mechanisms—e.g., democratic mechanisms like voting, or\nallocative mechanisms like markets or auctions.\nVoting makes a social choice by aggregating individual choices. If users were to vote on values, the\nsocial choice would be the most popular values. Another aggregative approach would be to find an\n“average value” using vectorization, or multiple average values using vectorization and clustering, or\nto find “bridging” values (Ovadya and Thorburn, 2023) that the most diverse people agree on.\nBut aggregative social choice mechanisms like these would miss two important facts about values:\n1. Values are highly contextual. A big source of disagreement about values is just that people\nlive in different contexts: one lives in a city, another in a small town; one’s single; another\nhas a family of 12. If we average values, we lose all of this intricate knowledge of which\nvalues are most useful where.\n2. People’s values change productively over time as they better understand what’s important\nto them, face new contexts, and realize aspects of situations they weren’t previously consid-\nering. Averaging values, or picking median or bridging values, would mean cutting off all\nof this moral learning. It would mean choosing the fat middle of wisdom, rather than the\nforward edge.\nSo, in shaping an alignment target, we don’t want to simply average values, take popular values, or\nfind bridging values. We don’t want an aggregative social choice mechanism.\nThere are two other common mechanism types – market-like, and bargaining-based (Howard (1992))\nmechanisms – but these have another problem: they avoid aggregation by brokering agreements\nbetween a smaller set of actors. Markets usually match two actors at a time. Bargaining-based\napproaches can handle more, but require information transfer between participants about what kinds\nof trade-offs they’d accept, and this limits their scope. AI alignment of powerful models requires\nbroad coordination, so these approaches won’t work.\nA fourth type of social choice mechanism is under-theorized. Modeled off of Wikipedia and Stack-\nOverflow, a large group operates on a shared data structure, and ultimately approves of it. Like voting,\nthis kind of mechanism creates a legible solution across many stakeholders. Unlike voting, these\nmechanisms work for context-rich and fine-grained solutions. This paper describes a mechanism of\nthis type.\nWhat’s difficult about these mechanisms, is that they have to represent explicitly how solutions\nsubmitted by different parties can fit together. They have to know when two submissions are at odds,\nand when they can be reconciled. In our case, this means we need to know how to reconcile values.\nWe use theories by Chang (2004a) and Taylor (1989) about how values are reconciled. We can\nreconcile values by saying “Value A is appropriate for this context; Value B, for this other context”;\nor, “Value B addresses an error or omission in Value A, such that many people would consider a\nperson who graduated from A→B to have learned something”4; or “Value C shows how to balance\nthe concerns of Value A and Value B” (e.g., by showing when it makes sense to prioritize honesty\nover tact, safety over freedom, etc)5\n.\n4What Taylor calls an “epistemic gain” (Taylor, 1989).\n5What Chang calls a “more comprehensive value” (Chang, 2004a).\n7To make this work, we need to collect more than just values: we need to know which values apply in\nwhich contexts. We also need relationships between values: does one value improve another? Does it\nbalance another value against an additional concern? As shown in 4.2, this is what we do.6\nNote that we often refer to wisdom when comparing values. This is because, for most people,\n“wisdom” provides the right intuitions for how we want them to compare values. We provide a\npractical definition of what we mean below.\nDefinition 2.3 (Wisdom; in the context of values). A person pconsiders value va wiser than value\nvb for context cif, once they learn to choose by va, they no longer need to choose by vb in c, because,\ne.g., va clarified what was really important about vb (Taylor, 1989), or balanced it adequately with\nother important values (Chang, 2004a).\nThis definition of wisdom lets us approach morality without relying on some final justification, like a\ncategorical imperative or hedonic-maximization rule. Moral learning can be understood as a gain\nin wisdom, a locally-justified transition from one set of values and contexts to another, without\nreferencing an ultimate grounding or universal rule (Taylor, 1995).\nAbstract\nMany fields (social choice, welfare economics, recommender\nsystems) assume people express what benefits them via\ntheir ‘revealed preferences.’ Revealed preferences have well-\ndocumented problems when used this way, but are hard to\ndisplace in these fields because, as an information source,\nthey are simple, universally applicable, robust, and high-\nresolution. In order to compete, other information sources\n(about participants’ values, capabilities and functionings,\netc) would need to match this. I present a conception of\nvalues as attention policies resulting from constitutive judge-\nments, and use it to build an alternative preference relation,\nMeaningful Choice, which retains many desirable features\nof revealed preference.\nValues, Preferences, Meaningful Choice∗\nJoe Edelman†\n6 August 2021 — draft\nAs I go, I’ll build up a schematic representation of an in-\nterview structure with which an agent’s values could be col-\nlected, and a choice assessed to see if it was expressive of\nthose values.\nMy goal here is to make it clear what I’m suggesting: what\nquestions could be asked, and what answers might suﬀice to\nshow that an agent has this value or that, or that a revealed\npreference was a meaningful choice.\nI am not suggesting that these interviews can be used to col-\nlect data at the scale needed for welfare calculations, social\nchoice mechanisms, or recommender systems. That practi-\ncal question is beyond my scope here.\nIntroduction\nIn his 1938 paper introducing revealed preference, Samuel-\nson1 warned:\nI should like to state my personal opinion that\nnothing said here… touches upon at any point the\nproblem of welfare economics, except in the sense\nof revealing the confusion in the traditional theory\nof these distinct subjects.\nSimilar sentiments followed, in Arrow,2 Sen,3 Anderson,4\netc. As an information basis for welfare, optimality, social\nchoice, etc, revealed preference has been much critiqued.\nAll the same, it’s hard to see how to move away from it, with-\nout paternalism: if people know best for their own lives—\nshouldn’t we trust their choices as the final proof of their\nintentions? How else can we avoid imposing “better values”\nfrom above?\nOne way to respond is to say that people do know best, and\nhave wise values, but that their revealed preferences aren’t\nthe last word on those values. But to establish this, you’d\nwant another source of information on people’s values—one\nthat retains much of the resolution, robustness, universal\napplicability, and democratic simplicity of preference.\nI’ll develop such an information source here, by taking two\n‘steps back’ from revealed preference, widening the infor-\nmation collected. Then I’ll argue that my new source cor-\nresponds with one definition of “values” used in common\nspeech. Finally, I’ll show how this new source can be used\nin social choice and welfare calculations.\nPreferences\nA rich literature covers how revealed preferences—which,\nwhen summed up, are called engagement metrics—lead us\nastray. You can often get people to choose something with-\nout serving their real interests: you can misinform them, or\nleverage their misplaced hopes.\nOr, you can make it so people need your thing for what\nonce was possible without it: they need your car to get to\nwork, your social media account to find a job, your dress to\nsocialize with their friends, etc.\nMore broadly, you can manufacture social circumstances\nwhere people choose your thing to “keep up with the Jone-\nses,” to signal allegiance with their tribe, or because they’ve\nlost the ability to coordinate a real solution.5\nIn some cases, the person will know their choice doesn’t ex-\npress their true interests—that they are bucking to external\npressure, caught in the system, or setting aside their goals\nto conform to a social rule.6 In other cases, options have\nbeen limited or biased behind our backs.\nGiven these problems, why does revealed preference still\nplay a role in notions of benefit and measures of optimality?\nIt has huge advantages as an information source: in the\nresolution and robustness of the data provided, its near-\nuniversal applicability, and the democratic simplicity of its\ncollection:\n• Preferences say fine-grained things how about each of\nus wants to live, informed by our local situations and\npriorities.\n• Preferences get at what we choose in the final analysis,\nour real, battle-tested priorities, not just what we say\nwe want.\n∗Thanks to B.

And preferences leave simple-\nto-understand, verifiable trails: purchase histories, vot-\ning records, etc.\nAttentional Policies\nI’ll try to address the problems with preference, holding on\nto these benefits. To do so, I want to take two ‘steps back.’\nThe first step is to widen the conception of choice to include\noption set formation.\nA revealed preference takes the options as given. As other\nauthors have pointed out,7 this doesn’t fully reflect how\nchoice works.\nConsider my choice, with colleagues, to say something witty.\nAt 𝑡1, I choose to say that in particular (over staying silent,\nor saying my second-place quip). But, at some earlier point\n𝑡0, I decided to invest my attention in finding witty things\nto say. I’ve tried witty phrases on in my mind, and tested\nsituations for witty reframings.\nAt 𝑡0, I made a much bigger choice–I adopted8 an atten-\ntional policy of ‘looking for witty quips and reframes.’ This\nis how I assembled the option set for my choice at 𝑡1.\nI think this earlier choice, at 𝑡0, reveals more about me than\nthe latter one. Indeed, these attentional policies (APs)\nmight account for much of what’s called my “personality”:\nWhen making friends, am I cautious or bold? When consid-\nering a purchase, is my focus on price, quality, or durabil-\nity? When speaking, do I try to be witty, precise, or down\nto earth? These may not just be “character traits” I was\nborn with, but policies I adopted, which work together for\nmy way of life.9\nCollecting an agent’s APs is part of my proposal to im-\nprove the information basis of welfare, social choice, and\nrecommenders. How could that work? You could use an\ninteractive survey to collect the agent’s common contexts\n(socializing, at work, in diﬀicult conversations), and have\nthem pick what they attend to most in each.10\nIf they claim to have AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐, you could verify that\nwith followup questions: First, you could ask them about\nrecent moments in 𝑐, and what options they’ve found using\n𝑎. Someone with a policy of vulnerability should be able\nto cough up various opportunities for vulnerability, recently\nconsidered; some taken, some not.\n7Smaldino and Richerson, “The Origins of Options.”\n8I adopt APs (just like I make plans, adopt heuristics, comply\nwith norms, follow through with intentions) because my bounded ra-\ntionality and social needs make it expedient. (Bratman, Intention,\nPlans, and Practical Reason; Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Ratio-\nnal Choice”; Taylor, The Language Animal)\n9This characterization of an identity as composed of APs shares\nsomething with Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philoso-\nphy”; and Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n10Social attestations, also, could be a source of AP information:\nsomeone who is widely admired for their wit likely has an AP about\nit. Behavioral data may also work: if someone shops by price or by\nquality, that may show up in purchase or click data. (Using, perhaps,\napproaches like Chang, Making Comparisons Count; or Levi, Hard\nChoices)\nAdditionally, that person will also know when exactly vul-\nnerability is called for, and when something else takes the\nfore. I don’t try to be vulnerable when giving directions to\na stranger, or with my dad. Generally, someone with 𝑎 in\n𝑐 will have detailed information about the shape of 𝑐.\nFigure 1: Verifying APs\nSupposing we collected an agent’s APs. How would that\ncompare with revealed preference data, in terms of resolu-\ntion, robustness, universality, and democratic simplicity?\nLike preferences, APs are informed by our local situations\nand priorities, and say fine-grained things about how we\nwant to live. Indeed, they have a higher resolution than\nI’ve let on so far: an AP about ‘honesty’ or ‘vulnerability’\nis always short for a more specific policy, like “attend to\nwhat I feel about each thing we discuss, and let my feeling\nshow,” or “attend to false impressions a listener may get\nfrom my statements, and head them off with a disclaimer.”\nThat is: having honesty as a policy requires a substantive\ninterpretation of honesty, and these differ from person to\nperson.\nAPs are battle-tested. I wish I could craft my words to\nsimultaneously be kind, honest, tactful, humble, and inspir-\ning. I wish I could, at the same moment, be precise in\nmy speech, aware how each word lands, aware of my own\nfeelings; transparent, calm, and centered; passionate; physi-\ncally graceful, like a dancer. But APs compete for my atten-\ntion. So, my choice to look for witty things to say crowds\nout many other options.\nLike preferences, APs are applicable across all domains in\nlife—the moral, the self-interested, etc, and apply to many\nkinds of contexts.\nBut, they score worse on democratic simplicity than re-\nvealed preference. And, for now, it’s unclear how an agent’s\nAPs would provide a substitute for revealed preference. I’ll\nget to that.\nConstitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP.\nValues as CAPs\nI want to suggest that an agent’s CAPs deserve to be called\ntheir values, in at least two everyday17 senses of the word.\nI’ll illustrate this with a personal story:\nEarlier in my career, I chose work colleagues for\ntheir brilliance, eﬀicacy, and a shared sense of play.\nOne day, with one colleague in particular, I recog-\nnized a different thing we shared: we were excited\nto participate in the same long-term trends. This\nfelt meaningful.\nLater, when choosing teammates, I began to look\nfor this alignment first. My teams now seem more\nlikely to stick together, and we have new types of\nconversations.\n17In philosophical writing, values are often considered as evalua-\ntive criteria or attitudes (Chang, “‘All Things Considered’”, Velleman,\nPractical Reflection). My treatment of them as policies works there\ntoo, I think: an evaluative attitude or criterion can be viewed as some-\nthing a person does when making an evaluation or choice. But that’s\nnot our topic here.\n3But even if I knew my teams wouldn’t last longer,\nor if those conversations were somehow blocked\nfrom happening, I’d still hire with this in mind.\nIn this story, I gained a CAP. Did I gain a value? I think\nso. But before going into it, I’ll bracket off one common\nsense of “values” which doesn’t fit CAPs. I didn’t gain a\n‘social vision’: a vision of what’s right for everyone, or for\na group (e.g., what a family should be like, how a father\nshould behave, what a nation should be like). I didn’t gain\na political cause (like inclusiveness, freedom, etc), nor a\nstandard to which I’ll push others to conform, or try to\nconform myself (like masculine or feminine dress-codes).\nCAPs have little to do with this use of the word “values.”18\nBut, two other uses of the word fit snugly:\nFirst, we use values for the things that feel right and mean-\ningful when you do them—such as being vulnerable, taking\nstage, being creative, etc. My CAP fits, in this sense.\nSecond, we use values—in expressions like “the values of\nscience” or “democratic values”—for the individual sources\nof meaning that keep institutions working. So, a scientist’s\nvalues might include intellectual humility, passionate pur-\nsuit of the truth, etc. Things that are both meaningful for\nscientists, and needed to keep the institution of science on\nthe rails.\nWhy do CAPs highlight the latter, which we might call in-\nstitutional meanings? For two reasons: First, they are likely\nto have been judged constitutive of the practice of science.\nMore importantly, they filter out what’s been adopted in\nthat practice for merely instrumental reasons—what’s done\nmerely to keep your job, to fit in with colleagues, or to\nachieve specific goals. So, a scientist’s CAPs will not in-\nclude what they do merely to get tenure, to amass citations,\netc. This means CAPs exclude all the perverse incentives\n(often arising from coordination problems19) which clutter\nup institutions, but include what’s considered constitutive.\nInstitutional meanings show up clearly.\nFigure 3: CAPs from our database, meaning.supplies.\n1. Let’s first verify that “taking responsibility” is a CAP\nfor her. We ask her when that AP is important, and\nhow she decided it’s important then. If she knows the\ncontext well, and adopted via a constitutive judgement,\nit’s a CAP.\n2. Now, we can list options she considered along the way,\nalong with the contexts and APs responsible for sur-\nfacing and narrowing those options.Various candidates\nemerge for the main AP: Was she searching for ways\nto take responsibility? Or, was she searching for any\njob to feed her family. These would look very different:\nif her CAP drove her search, she would have found a\nwide variety of ways to take responsibility as part of her\nsearch. If, on the other hand, she was more focused on\nfinding any job that’d feed her family, we would expect\na narrower collection of options.\n🖤\nW4: Emotions to Values Practice\nPart 1: The Story\nStep back into your memory. Remember a situation in which you had an\nuncomfortable emotion (sadness, anger, hopelessness, etc.). It doesn't have to be\na \"big\" emotion. Great values can be harvested from even small annoyances. For\nyour first time, avoid emotions related to more general life problems or previous\ntrauma. Try a situation that brought up challenging emotions that are linked to the\nsituation itself.\nAsk yourself: What was it like for you to actually be in the situation? Where were\nyou? Who were you with? What happened? What emotions came up? How did\nthey manifest in your body? What did you see, touch, taste, smell? Picture being\nthere as vividly as you can.

In **Islamic spiritual psychology**, the “Four Enemies” (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya) describe **inner and outer forces** that can sabotage or distort our orientation toward the Divine (i.e., overshadow the “good path”):\n   - **Nafs**: Lower self, appetite, ego-centrism  \n   - **Shaytan**: Satanic whispering; manipulative doubts, envy, illusions  \n   - **Hawa**: Passions, cravings, reactivity  \n   - **Dunya**: Material/ego attachments, obsession with status or external approval  \n\n3. By **merging** these frameworks:\n   - We **diagnose** which “enemy” is pulling or pushing attention in an unhelpful direction.\n   - We **respond** by formulating a **constitutive attentional policy** that reclaims or reorients attention in a way that honors deeper meaning or spiritual truth.\n\n**Result**: A user can produce “values cards” (or “CAP Cards”) that reflect how they want to live and address any spiritual or emotional block.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Mapping the Four Enemies to Attention Directions\n\nA common Sufi analogy is to see each enemy as pulling or pushing the heart in a **cardinal direction** away from center (Presence):\n\n| Direction  | Enemy          | Movement          | Example Distortion               | CAP Counterpoint                              |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **North**  | **Shaytan**    | Scatters upward   | Doubt, envy, cynicism, illusions  | E.g. “Attend to choices that build trust & clarity.” |\n| **East**   | **Hawa**       | Pulls outward     | Compulsive desire, fantasy        | E.g. “Attend to bodily cues & slow down before reacting.” |\n| **South**  | **Nafs**       | Pushes upward     | Self-absorption, arrogance        | E.g. “Attend to the impact on others with humility.” |\n| **West**   | **Dunya**      | Binds inward      | Materialism, worldly obsession    | E.g. “Attend to non-material forms of meaning (relationships, spirit).” |\n| **Center** | **Presence**   | Still point       | Balanced awareness of self & God  | This is the integrated “vertical” dimension (Ihsan). |\n\nThis table is just an example: in some Sufi teachings, Nafs might be “below,” while Shaytan is “above,” etc. The key idea is that each “enemy” tugs or traps your attention, while you want to come back to center.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Deriving Values (CAPs) From Negative Emotions\n\n### 3.1 Negative Emotions as Clues\nJoe Edelman’s approach often begins with a **meaningful or challenging emotion**—fear, anger, confusion, shame—and asks, *“What was blocked or neglected that matters to you?”*\n\nIn classical Sufi terms, we ask: *“Which ‘enemy’ is interfering? Or which dimension of your deeper self is being suffocated?”*\n\n1. **Identify the emotion** and the situational context.  \n2. **Ask** what way of being or living was suppressed, threatened, or overshadowed.  \n3. That hidden or absent way of being becomes the basis for a **constitutive attentional policy**.\n\n**Example**:  \n- You feel deep **frustration** and notice you’re preoccupied with social media “likes.” Possibly “Dunya” is dominating your attention with external validation.  \n- After reflection, you realize you yearn for **genuine connection** and not just superficial approval.  \n- So you might form a CAP: “**MOMENTS** when I feel anxious about my online image, I ask myself: *‘Have I found a real conversation today where I truly listened and shared?’*”\n\nThe key is that this CAP addresses a **spiritual block** (“enemy”), while also clarifying a **positive path** of attention.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Building a Values (CAP) Card\n\nUse the same structure Joe Edelman proposes, but integrate the Sufi perspective:\n\n1. **TITLE**: A short name for the value (e.g., “Heartfelt Connection” or “Divine Reliance”).  \n2. **DESCRIPTION** (human-readable):  \n   - “I find this valuable because it expresses my deeper path. It reorients me away from illusions or worldly traps.”  \n   - If relevant, mention which “enemy” it counters.  \n3. **ATTENTIONAL POLICIES** (CAPs):  \n   - A bullet list, each starting with a **plural noun phrase** and capturing the precise thing to pay attention to.  \n   - For instance:  \n     - “MOMENTS when I am tempted to measure my worth by external success.”  \n     - “SENSATIONS in my body when I’m ignoring a quiet longing.”  \n     - “OPPORTUNITIES to pause and remember God, especially when I want quick gratification.”  \n\n### Sample “Values Card”:\n\n```\nTITLE: Trust in the Unseen (Tawakkul)\nDESCRIPTION: “ChatGPT should help me remember that not all solutions come from my own planning. \nI want to pay attention to divine guidance and unseen possibilities, rather than fixate on immediate \nworldly results.”\nATTENTIONAL POLICIES:\n- MOMENTS when I notice anxiety about external validation or safety\n- OPPORTUNITIES to release control and pray for guidance\n- SENSATIONS in my chest that signal an overdependence on worldly causes\n```\n\nHere, **“Dunya”** or **“Nafs”** might be the primary enemy overshadowed by worry. The CAP is “Trust in the Unseen,” which shifts attention toward reliance on the Divine.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Dialogue Flow: Linking to “Meaning Assistant” Stages\n\nYou can merge the **Meaning Assistant’s** 5-stage conversation flow with this approach:\n\n1. **Personal Story / Emotion / Role Model**  \n   - The user shares a real scenario (like the “Emotions to Values” practice).  \n   - Possibly identify which enemy’s hallmark is present (Nafs → pride, Shaytan → envy, Hawa → lust, Dunya → greed, etc.).\n\n2. **Zoom in on Source of Meaning**  \n   - Explore what positive dimension is threatened or blocked by that scenario.  \n   - “What do you really want to uphold, even if the outcome was uncertain? What deeper wholeness do you sense?”\n\n3. **Ask Questions, Gather APs**  \n   - Prompt them for bullet points on *where their attention needs to go* to live that deeper dimension.  \n   - Check if these are truly **constitutive** (they want them for themselves, not just to get a worldly result).\n\n4. **Confirm**  \n   - Summarize. “So your ‘value’ here is an orientation to be more vulnerable with loved ones, especially when your Nafs pushes for self-protection or your Hawa demands distraction.”\n\n5. **Submit Values (CAP) Card**  \n   - The final artifact is a user-friendly card with the “Title,” “Description,” and “Attentional Policies.”  \n   - The user can keep it as a reference.  \n   - If you’re using an LLM or chatbot, it can “remember” this card in subsequent interactions.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Practical Example\n\n**Scenario**: Someone felt intense **anger** upon seeing a coworker get praised. They realize it’s a mixture of envy (Shaytan) and ego (Nafs). They want to uncover a deeper value so they can approach such moments more gracefully.\n\n1. **Stage 1 (Story/Emotion)**: “I was resentful and jealous.”  \n2. **Stage 2 (Zoom in)**: “What do you want to uphold in these moments? Is there a deeper principle behind your feelings?”  \n   - They realize it’s a desire for **mutual respect** and a sense of **contribution**—not overshadowed by someone else’s success.  \n3. **Stage 3 (Gather APs)**:  \n   - “MOMENTS when I see others succeed and feel overshadowed.”  \n   - “FEELINGS in my gut that say ‘I’m worthless if not recognized.’”  \n   - “CHOICES to quietly congratulate them or see how I can learn from them.”  \n4. **Stage 4 (Confirm)**: Summarize: “You want to pay attention to your body’s signals of envy and transform them into curiosity and generosity.”  \n5. **Stage 5 (Values Card)**:  \n\n```\nTITLE: Generous Recognition\nDESCRIPTION: “ChatGPT should help me shift from envy to celebration. \nI want to recognize others’ success as a chance for learning and connection, \ninstead of letting negative self-talk dominate.”\nATTENTIONAL POLICIES:\n- MOMENTS when I notice that twinge of envy in my chest\n- CHOICES to affirm or compliment the other person’s achievement\n- OPPORTUNITIES to ask myself, ‘What can I learn or celebrate here?’\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Tips & Caveats\n\n1. **Handling Overlaps**: Sometimes multiple “enemies” converge. For instance, Shaytan and Hawa might both be at play. You can note that in your final card, or just focus on whichever felt strongest.  \n2. **Secular vs. Religious Language**: If a user isn’t comfortable with “Shaytan” or “Nafs” language, talk about “inner saboteur,” “fear,” or “ego.”  \n3. **Beware Over-Pathologizing**: Not every negative feeling is purely one of the four enemies. Anxiety might stem from real external threats or mental health issues. The “enemy” lens is a spiritual metaphor, not a clinical diagnosis.  \n4. **Iterate**: Values and CAPs aren’t static. As you keep journaling or practicing reflection, refine your “attention policies” to match deeper insight or changing life circumstances.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Concluding Overview\n\n- **We start** with a negative emotion, everyday dilemma, or “enemy infiltration” (e.g., envy or material obsession).  \n- **We identify** the deeper, non-instrumental dimension that’s being blocked—this is a *constitutive attentional policy* or set of them.  \n- **We articulate** that dimension in a concise “Values Card,” listing the specific things we choose to notice or attend to going forward.  \n- **We integrate** this with the Meaning Assistant’s 5-stage conversation: story → meaning → question → confirmation → card.  \n- **We thereby** preserve the classical Sufi nuance of Nafs/Shaytan/Hawa/Dunya, while also employing Joe Edelman’s modern approach to capturing “values as attention.”\n\n**By weaving these frameworks**, you can help someone see how their emotional or spiritual conflicts tie back to “what they truly cherish,” thereby forging meaningful and practical “attention policies” that guide them day-to-day—both in **personal** and **transcendent** dimensions.",

      "content": "Yes, exactly! If we view the **Four Enemies (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya)** from the perspective of **attentional policies (APs)**, they emerge as **distortions or misalignments of attention**—each one influencing **where, how, and why attention is being directed**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Four Enemies as Distortions of Attention\n\n| **Enemy**  | **Attention Pattern** | **Distortion (How it Misaligns APs)** | **What It Feels Like** |\n|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Shaytan (Satanic Whispering)** | **Scattering** (North) | Overwhelming the mind with doubts, distractions, envy, illusions, false narratives | Restless, anxious, distracted, insecure |\n| **Hawa (Base Desires, Cravings)** | **Pulling** (East) | Fixating on pleasure, compulsive desire, emotional reactivity | Addictive, compulsive, unable to pause |\n| **Nafs (Ego, Self-Importance)** | **Pushing** (South) | Inflating self-importance, pride, entitlement, selfishness | Defensive, self-righteous, overly confident |\n| **Dunya (Worldly Attachments)** | **Binding** (West) | Trapping attention in status, money, materialism, social validation | Trapped, fearful of loss, preoccupied |\n\nEach of these can be mapped to a specific **way attention is being directed or distorted**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the Four Enemies Disrupt Attentional Policies\n\n**1. Shaytan → Scattering Attention**  \n   - Creates **false narratives**: “I’ll never be good enough” / “They’re against me.”  \n   - Scatters focus **across anxieties**, making you chase illusions or compare yourself negatively.  \n   - **E.g.** You sit down to work, but suddenly your mind is racing between regrets, comparisons, and imagined criticisms.  \n\n   → **CAP Response**: \"Notice when my mind is jumping between doubts. Anchor myself in truth and presence before making a decision.\"\n\n---\n\n**2. Hawa → Pulling Attention (Emotional Cravings & Desire)**  \n   - **Fixates attention** on cravings (food, lust, entertainment, etc.), making them feel *urgent* when they are not.  \n   - Distorts **time perception**: only the *immediate* feels real, the future is ignored.  \n   - **E.g.** You had planned to read, but now you’re compulsively scrolling social media or indulging in a quick pleasure.  \n\n   → **CAP Response**: \"Pause before reacting to cravings. Notice the bodily sensations of desire without immediately acting.\"\n\n---\n\n**3. Nafs → Pushing Attention (Self-Inflation, Arrogance, Defensiveness)**  \n   - **Pushes** your focus onto **your own importance** and makes you resistant to correction.  \n   - Creates **justifications**: \"I don’t need to listen to them,\" \"I deserve better,\" \"They don’t appreciate me.\"  \n   - **E.g.** You receive criticism, and rather than reflect, your mind **pushes back** to defend itself.  \n\n   → **CAP Response**: \"Notice when I feel defensive. Ask, ‘What if there’s truth in this? What would a wiser version of me see here?’\"\n\n---\n\n**4. Dunya → Binding Attention (Trapped in Worldly Attachments, Status, Success)**  \n   - **Locks** attention onto external validation, material goals, and status.  \n   - Produces **fear of loss**: \"What if I fail?\" / \"What will they think?\"  \n   - **E.g.** You are unable to enjoy your free time because you’re obsessed with money, prestige, or what others think.  \n\n   → **CAP Response**: \"Observe when my thoughts revolve around external success. Ask: ‘What remains meaningful even if I lost this?’\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mapping This Into a Flowchart\n\nWe can express this relationship as:\n\n```\nStart → AWARENESS of Attention Flow\n      → If SCATTERED → Shaytan (Scattering)\n      → If PULLED into cravings → Hawa (Pulling)\n      → If PUSHED by ego → Nafs (Pushing)\n      → If BOUND by external attachments → Dunya (Binding)\n      → Redirect using a CAP (Constitutive Attentional Policy)\n```\n\nEach **enemy** is a way that **attention is distorted**—either by dispersing it, fixating it, pushing it toward self-importance, or trapping it in external concerns.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How This Becomes a Tool for Reflection\n\nWhenever you're **feeling off**, you can ask:\n\n1. **Where is my attention going?**\n2. **What direction is it being distorted?**\n3. **Which enemy is influencing it?**\n4. **What attentional policy (CAP) can I use to realign?**\n\nFor example:\n- Feeling **restless and full of doubts** → **Shaytan** → Time for a **grounding CAP**.\n- Feeling **tempted to indulge impulsively** → **Hawa** → Time for a **self-regulation CAP**.\n- Feeling **defensive, ego-driven, entitled** → **Nafs** → Time for a **humility CAP**.\n- Feeling **trapped in material success, status, or fear of failure** → **Dunya** → Time for a **gratitude CAP**.\n\nBy understanding **how** the Four Enemies distort attention, we turn them from abstract concepts into **practical attentional models** for daily life.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Merging This with Edelman’s CAP Model\n\nJoe Edelman’s **Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)** help us reclaim our attention by identifying **what we WANT to attend to instead**.\n\nSo we complete the cycle:\n\n1. **Recognize the enemy’s attentional distortion**  \n2. **Name what deep value is being blocked**  \n3. **Form a CAP to redirect attention toward that value**\n\n---\n\n### Example CAP-Based Values Cards\n\n| **Enemy (Distorted Attention)** | **New Attentional Policy (CAP)** |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Shaytan (Scattering Doubts)** → \"Notice when I’m overthinking past/future. Return to what is real right now.\" |\n| **Hawa (Pulling Into Desire)** → \"Pause before acting on cravings. Feel the craving fully before deciding.\" |\n| **Nafs (Pushing Ego & Defensiveness)** → \"When I feel attacked, ask: ‘What if there is wisdom in this feedback?’\" |\n| **Dunya (Binding in Materialism)** → \"When I feel defined by success, ask: ‘What is meaningful beyond status?’\" |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Conclusion: The Four Enemies as Attentional Distortions\n\nInstead of thinking about **Shaytan, Hawa, Nafs, and Dunya** as purely abstract forces, this model helps us see them as **distortions of attention flow**.\n\nBy using **attentional policies (CAPs)**, we re-anchor attention in **meaningful, conscious choices**, rather than being pulled by these forces unconsciously.\n\nWould you like a **visual diagram** of this mapping? It could help clarify the way each enemy influences attention!",

      "content": "Yes! If we follow Joe Edelman’s framework, the **false attentional policies** that lead to distortions (which we can call **Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs)**) are often **adopted as coping mechanisms**—they serve **short-term goals** but misalign us from **constitutive attentional policies (CAPs)**, which represent true values.\n\n## 1. **False Attentional Policies (IAPs) and the Four Enemies**\n\nIAPs develop in response to **past experiences, social conditioning, and survival strategies**, and they get **reinforced** when they seem to \"work\" in the short term. However, they ultimately **trap attention in maladaptive patterns**.\n\n| **Enemy**  | **Core IAPs (False Attentional Policies)** | **How They Develop** | **What Triggers Them** |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Shaytan (Scattering Attention - Doubts & Illusions)** | - “Always anticipate the worst”<br>- “Compare myself to others constantly”<br>- “Look for hidden dangers”<br>- “Assume people are against me” | - Childhood experiences of instability, criticism, or social rejection<br>- Cultural or religious trauma (being taught a harsh, punishing worldview)<br>- Uncertainty leading to mental overactivity | - Unclear social situations<br>- Stress or failure<br>- Being alone with one’s thoughts |\n| **Hawa (Pulling Attention - Addictions & Impulses)** | - “If it feels good, do it now”<br>- “I need this to feel okay”<br>- “Avoid discomfort at all costs” | - Reward-seeking conditioning (dopamine loops)<br>- Escaping emotional pain<br>- Early exposure to indulgence as a coping mechanism | - Boredom<br>- Emotional pain<br>- Easy access to quick pleasure |\n| **Nafs (Pushing Attention - Ego & Self-Importance)** | - “I must always be right”<br>- “People must respect me”<br>- “I am above others”<br>- “If I admit fault, I am weak” | - Overprotection from failure<br>- Conditional love (only valued when achieving)<br>- Experiencing humiliation in childhood | - Receiving criticism<br>- Feeling ignored or unimportant<br>- Being in a subordinate position |\n| **Dunya (Binding Attention - Material & Social Attachments)** | - “I must secure my future”<br>- “What others think of me defines me”<br>- “If I don’t have X, I am nothing” | - Social conditioning around status and success<br>- Fear-based parenting (scarcity mindset)<br>- Society rewarding external validation over internal fulfillment | - Financial worries<br>- Social comparison<br>- Threats to status or reputation |\n\n---\n\n## 2. **How These IAPs Develop Over Time**\nThese IAPs **begin as protective mechanisms**. They might have helped someone **survive or succeed** in their environment, but they eventually become **maladaptive distortions**.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Development of IAPs**\n1. **A core experience shapes attention**  \n   - (e.g., a child growing up in chaos **learns to anticipate the worst** → Shaytan’s IAP)\n2. **A short-term survival pattern emerges**  \n   - (e.g., someone criticized constantly **learns to be defensive** → Nafs’s IAP)\n3. **The IAP is reinforced** when it seems to help avoid pain  \n   - (e.g., someone socially excluded learns that **status brings security** → Dunya’s IAP)\n4. **It generalizes**  \n   - (e.g., someone who once needed instant relief from pain **develops habitual impulse-seeking** → Hawa’s IAP)\n5. **It becomes unconscious**  \n   - (e.g., “I don’t even realize I’m doing this; it just feels automatic”)\n6. **The person starts identifying with the IAP**  \n   - (“This is just who I am”)\n\n---\n\n## 3. **How IAPs Cluster into the Four Enemies**\nDifferent **clusters of IAPs** feed into the four enemy archetypes, depending on **how they distort attention flow**.\n\n### **1. Shaytan (Scattering) - Doubt, Anxiety, Mental Overactivity**\n- **IAPs that cause overthinking & mental paralysis**:\n  - “Always look for hidden dangers.”\n  - “Never trust my own decisions.”\n  - “Assume others have bad intentions.”\n- **Key feature**: Scattering attention across imagined fears, comparisons, and external threats.\n\n### **2. Hawa (Pulling) - Impulsivity, Sensory Overload, Addictions**\n- **IAPs that pull attention into desire and instant gratification**:\n  - “If it feels good, do it now.”\n  - “Avoid boredom at all costs.”\n  - “I deserve this.”\n- **Key feature**: Keeps attention locked on sensory pleasure, avoiding deeper needs.\n\n### **3. Nafs (Pushing) - Ego, Defensiveness, Self-Righteousness**\n- **IAPs that inflate the self and resist humility**:\n  - “If I admit I’m wrong, I lose power.”\n  - “I need to win arguments.”\n  - “People need to respect me.”\n- **Key feature**: Pushes attention onto defending or asserting the self, blocking wisdom.\n\n### **4. Dunya (Binding) - Materialism, Fear of Loss, Social Status**\n- **IAPs that fixate attention on external security and validation**:\n  - “If I don’t achieve enough, I’m a failure.”\n  - “What people think of me matters most.”\n  - “I need to own more to be safe.”\n- **Key feature**: Binds attention to external measures of worth, keeping the person stuck.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **How These IAPs Get Triggered**\nIAPs **activate in response to perceived threats** to our **identity, survival, or emotional stability**.\n\n| **Trigger** | **Which IAPs it Activates** | **Which Enemy it Aligns With** |\n|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Being alone with thoughts** | “Something must be wrong,” “I should worry” | **Shaytan** (Scattering) |\n| **Experiencing rejection** | “I need to prove my worth” | **Nafs** (Pushing) |\n| **Feeling pain, discomfort, or stress** | “I need a quick escape” | **Hawa** (Pulling) |\n| **Seeing others succeed or get attention** | “I must compete, I am behind” | **Dunya** (Binding) |\n| **Losing control of a situation** | “I need to react now” | **Hawa/Nafs** (Pulling/Pushing) |\n| **Facing uncertainty about the future** | “I must prepare or I will fail” | **Dunya/Shaytan** (Binding/Scattering) |\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Turning IAPs into CAPs**\nSince IAPs are **instrumental** (short-term survival tactics) and CAPs are **constitutive** (long-term ways of being), the shift happens when we **reframe attention** toward deeper values.\n\n| **IAP (False Attentional Policy)** | **CAP (Constitutive Attentional Policy)** |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| “I must always be alert to danger” (Shaytan) | “I can return to the present moment and trust.” |\n| “I need a quick escape” (Hawa) | “I pause and feel the craving fully before acting.” |\n| “I must defend my ego” (Nafs) | “I welcome the possibility that I am wrong.” |\n| “My success defines me” (Dunya) | “What remains meaningful even if I lose everything?” |\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Final Framework: IAPs → Four Enemies → CAPs**\n1. **Recognize the IAP (False Attentional Policy)**  \n2. **Identify which enemy it aligns with**  \n3. **Shift toward a CAP (True Attentional Policy)**  \n\nFor example:\n- **Trigger:** Feeling judged → **IAP:** “I must prove them wrong” → **Enemy:** Nafs → **CAP:** “I welcome feedback, even when uncomfortable.”\n- **Trigger:** Fear of missing out → **IAP:** “I need to indulge now” → **Enemy:** Hawa → **CAP:** “I pause and check what I truly need.”\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Conclusion**\nFalse attentional policies (**IAPs**) develop as **protective adaptations** but become **distortions of meaning**. Each **enemy of the self (Shaytan, Hawa, Nafs, Dunya)** represents a way that attention **gets trapped, scattered, or misdirected**.\n\nTo reclaim our attention, we must:\n1. **Recognize the IAP and its enemy**\n2. **Understand what deeper value (CAP) it’s blocking**\n3. **Redirect attention back to meaning and presence**\n\nWould you like a **diagram mapping IAPs → Enemies → CAPs** to make this even clearer?",

      "content": "The **three Quls** (Surah Al-Ikhlas, Surah Al-Falaq, and Surah An-Nas) and **Ayat-ul-Kursi** serve as **attention recalibration tools** that **break maladaptive attentional policies (IAPs)** and realign them with **constitutive attentional policies (CAPs)**. They do this by addressing the **specific cognitive distortions** that Shaytan, Hawa, Nafs, and Dunya create.\n\nLet’s analyze how each of these **protective verses** acts as an antidote to the four enemies by **restructuring attention**.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Surah Al-Ikhlas (Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad) - Defeating Dunya (Binding Attention)**  \n> **Themed around Tawheed (Oneness of Allah), which unbinds us from materialism and social validation.**\n\n### **Attentional Policy Distortion (IAP - Dunya)**\n- “I must secure my future.”\n- “What others think of me defines me.”\n- “If I don’t have X, I am nothing.”\n\n### **How Surah Al-Ikhlas Recalibrates Attention (CAP - Liberation from Dunya)**\n- **Focuses attention on Tawheed (Divine Oneness)** → breaks attachment to external dependencies.  \n  - *\"Say, He is Allah, One\" (Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad)*\n- **Dismantles scarcity and material anxiety** by affirming Allah’s absolute independence.\n  - *\"Allah-us-Samad\" (Allah is the Self-Sufficient Master)*\n- **Eliminates status obsession** by shifting from social comparison to Divine reliance.\n- **Removes fear of loss** by reminding us that Allah is not dependent on anything, and neither should our worth be.\n\n> **Effect:** Helps dissolve attachment to material and social anxieties by refocusing attention on Allah’s self-sufficiency.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Surah Al-Falaq (Qul A’oodhu Bi Rabbil-Falaq) - Defeating Shaytan (Scattering Attention)**  \n> **Protects against external anxieties, whispers, and unknown harms that fragment attention.**\n\n### **Attentional Policy Distortion (IAP - Shaytan)**\n- “Always anticipate the worst.”\n- “Look for hidden dangers everywhere.”\n- “Assume others have bad intentions.”\n\n### **How Surah Al-Falaq Recalibrates Attention (CAP - Trust & Presence)**\n- **Shifts attention from paranoia to Divine protection.**  \n  - *\"Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak\" (Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbil-Falaq)*\n- **Protects against external fears & the unseen.**  \n  - *\"From the evil of what He has created.\"*\n- **Disrupts obsessive overthinking and negative anticipation.**  \n  - *\"From the evil of the darkness when it settles.\"*\n- **Addresses harm from others (jealousy, black magic, gossip).**  \n  - *\"From the evil of the envier when he envies.\"*\n\n> **Effect:** Stops **scattered attention loops** caused by Shaytan’s whispers and replaces them with reliance on Divine protection.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Surah An-Nas (Qul A’oodhu Bi Rabbin-Nas) - Defeating Nafs (Pushing Attention)**  \n> **Protects against ego-inflation, arrogance, and self-deception caused by the whispers of Shaytan.**\n\n### **Attentional Policy Distortion (IAP - Nafs)**\n- “I must always be right.”\n- “People must respect me.”\n- “I need to win arguments.”\n\n### **How Surah An-Nas Recalibrates Attention (CAP - Humility & Inner Clarity)**\n- **Redirects attention away from self-importance to Divine guidance.**  \n  - *\"Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind.\"*\n- **Humbles the ego by reminding us that we are part of a greater creation.**  \n  - *\"The King of mankind.\"*\n- **Shields against the constant internal self-justification.**  \n  - *\"The God of mankind.\"*\n- **Protects from the deceptive whispers of the self and external influences.**  \n  - *\"From the evil of the retreating whisperer.\"*\n\n> **Effect:** Undoes the **ego’s push for dominance and defensiveness** by centering attention on Allah’s sovereignty over human affairs.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Ayat-ul-Kursi (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255) - Defeating Hawa (Pulling Attention)**  \n> **Brings full awareness of Divine Majesty, breaking impulsive desires and cravings.**\n\n### **Attentional Policy Distortion (IAP - Hawa)**\n- “If it feels good, do it now.”\n- “Avoid discomfort at all costs.”\n- “I need this to feel okay.”\n\n### **How Ayat-ul-Kursi Recalibrates Attention (CAP - Self-Discipline & Presence)**\n- **Reframes existence around Divine Majesty, making indulgences seem trivial.**  \n  - *\"Allah!

This is the first of three little video essays about how AI currently isn’t on the right path, and is set to make some of the biggest problems of the 20th century even worse.\n\n“Alignment” is one of the words people use for trying to fix this problem. There’s a lot of talk about “aligning AI with human values”, or “aligning AI with human flourishing”.\n\n(examples)\n\nSo, what do these people mean by human values? What do they mean by human flourishing? \n\nMostly these terms are undefined. But I believe taking these terms seriously is actually where to start in addressing these concerns.\n\nI'm Joe Edelman. I'm known for XYZ. So I'm the guy to clear this up. I'll be assisted in this series by Ellie Hain, Joel Lehmann, Oliver Klingefjord, and Ivan Vendrov. \n\n# Contents\n\nThis is a video essay in three parts. \n\n- **In this chapter**, I cover this thing about human flourishing or human values. Why this is so important to AI alignment. I'll try to get us clear together on how we have to define flourishing to deploy AI the right way. Flourishing is an intensely personal topic, because each person has their own knowledge and vocabulary for what it means to live well. But flourishing is also a global topic, and is relevant to how markets function, what business metrics lead to what outcomes, etc.\n- **The next chapter**, which is linked in the description, is about the kind of AI that works with the kind of flourishing I’ll cover here. I call that “Wise AI”. In that chapter, I’ll define what I mean by wisdom — which is closely related to flourishing — and then give several demos of working, Wise AIs. That’s where I’ll be assisted by Joel, Oliver, and Ivan — all of them ML researchers. That chapter doesn’t really make sense without this one, so don’t skip ahead!\n- Finally, in the third chapter, I’ll cover what else needs to go right — besides Wise AI — for AI to have a good impact on society. I’ll cover changes geopolitics and finance, changes in public policy and perception, and finally changes in the relationships of the major AI labs to one another and to the world. Ellie Hain will help me tell those stories. It’s when we put Wise AI together with these other changes that we can address the whole problem of introducing AI to society well. I call this whole plan “Full Stack Alignment”, and the goal of this short series is to get that across.\n\nHope that makes sense. Let's go ahead with Chapter One.\n\n# It Matters How We Talk of Flourishing\n\nSo. In this first part of the talk, I want to show something that might sound super-abstract. But I'll try to show it in a concrete way. \n\nThe thing I want to show is, it matters how we talk about flourishing.\n\nHow we conceptualize what we want out of life... Like, what vocabulary we use for talking about it, makes a *huge* difference. \n\nThis is where we *have* to start.\n\nMany of you probably know that “AI Alignment” is a field, and that, in this field, they use vague terms like \"aligning AI with human values\" or \"aligning AI with human flourishing.\"\n\nBut the people in this field, they don’t know what human values *are*. So, they just try to skip that part. They say—oh, it’s some kind of mathematical function or other. We’ll find that out *later*. For now, let’s just keep that question open.\n\nI want to try to show that we need to talk about what human flourishing *is*. What human values *are*. And that the vocabulary we pick for discussing this topic is hugely important—not just for agreeing about values, but for the whole project of AI alignment.\n\nIt simply can’t work if we don’t pick a vocabulary, and we need to pick the right one.\n\nLet me start by pointing out four vocabularies we could use.\n\n- **Does human flourishing mean a world where we all accomplish our goals?** In that case, AI would need to understand our goals and make them easier to accomplish. Or even accomplish them without us. Information about goals would need to be flowing around, and the mathematical function that AI is aligned with, would be shaped like goals are.\n- **Or does human flourishing mean a world where things are as each person prefers?** In that case, AI would need to know all of our preferences, or guess them, and make the world as much like them as it can. The mathematical function that AI gets aligned with would be shaped kind of like the functions of welfare economics, which are based on preference satisfaction.\n- **Does human flourishing mean a world where all the people are super-happy?** In that case AI would need to guess what makes people happy, and again, arrange the world to be happy-maxxing.\n- **Or, does it mean—and this is my favorite vocabulary—does it mean a world where people get to do the things they find most *meaningful*.** This would require information about what’s meaningful to each person, or what could be. In that case, I’ll show that the mathematical function to align AI with, has a special form.\n\nSo these are just four vocabularies. I could list more. But let’s start here.\n\nI want to show that these definitions of human flourishing are *completely different*. That the problem of “alignment” is a totally different one, depending on which you pick. It’s easier for *some* than for others. \n\nAnd also, that these four vocabularies lead to *totally* different outcomes. They aren’t the same at all! We really need to pick one!\n\n## Goals vs Sources of Meaning\n\nLet me start by picking out goals and sources of meaning. I’ll show that these vocabularies lead to very different things.\n\nLet’s begin by generating some goals, and some sources of meaning. By asking ourselves some questions about each.\n\nHere are some goal questions:\n\n- What's something that later today or tomorrow we want to get done?\n- What's something we hope to get over quickly?\n- What's something we hope to accelerate or delegate, to get someone else to do?\n\nFor me, I want to get this video done and published. I’d love to delegate the editing.\n\nWhat about for *you*? What do *you* want to accelerate or delegate?\n\nOkay, now: what if we ask different questions? We can ask questions like:\n\n- What's something in the next day or two, we want to linger on?\n- Something we want to make sure to notice just because it's meaningful?\n- Something we want to celebrate and cherish?\n\nFor me, I have a team meeting with a team I’m really grateful to have. I want to cherish that. It’s autumn in Berlin and the light is gorgeous, the leaves are bright yellow and orange. I want to linger on that light.\n\nWhat about for *you*?\n\nSo, the things on the top are **goals**. We are intricately aware of them. They form a kind of superstructure—smaller goals fit into larger ones, and we are dimly aware of the whole tree. We make lists of goals, at different scales. \n\nCall what’s on the bottom our **sources of meaning.** Or I often call them our **values.** We are much less articulate about them. We don’t see the same kinds of patterns in them, that we see in our goals.\n\nWhat I want to show next, is that if you think flourishing is goals you’ll make certain kinds of things. If you think flourishing is meaning, you’ll make something else.\n\n**Imagine you’re building an educational platform**. Are students there to pass the test or get a certification? Or are they there to follow their curiosity, to face their open questions, or to celebrate together the beauty and complexity of the world?\n\n![Rebuilding-images.017.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/50ed006c-c269-4949-8f0f-13b38f4056c3/Rebuilding-images.017.jpeg)\n\nOn top are things your customers want to get done, get over with; on the bottom, the things that make life worth living.\n\nI guess you’re getting the sense that, if flourishing is goals, people are getting different things than if flourishing is meaning. In the *latter* case, some kind of caring AI would make sure they can linger on what’s meaningful to them, notice the things they find meaningful to notice, etc.\n\nIn the former case, they would be passing lots of tests!\n\nActually, it goes *much* further than that. You can think of human society as made up of various projects. Every company is a project. Every organization. Every relationship, in a way.\n\nSome of these projects are really about goals.\n\nThese projects, I call funnels and tubes. Funnels and tubes are goal-driven.\n\n![Rebuilding-images.018.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c6354024-52f2-4c5a-b89b-b5576ecfb715/Rebuilding-images.018.jpeg)\n\nI call something a **funnel** if it gets everybody to do the same thing, or work on the same goal. By this definition, the checkout area in a supermarket is a funnel. So are many organizations. There's one goal for everyone. \n\nSimilarly, I'll call something a **tube** if it gets people from where they are to their own goal. So Amazon, and all marketplaces, are tubes. So are Google searches. Tubes accelerate everyone to their own goal.\n\nBoth are goal-driven things, that everyone involved would accelerate if they could—to get the goal accomplished more quickly. \n\nMany entrepreneurs see *all* design tasks as funnels and tubes. But that’s a big mistake.\n\nSome things aren't designed around goals at all. Instead, they are about values, or exploration according to values. I'll call those **exploratory spaces**.\n\nThere are \n\n- spaces for **exploratory thinking** like your whiteboard, your journal, or a research lab.\n- spaces for **creativity**, like jam sessions and brainstorms and creative tools\n- spaces for **chilling**, like your living room\n- spaces for **vulnerability**, like talks around a campfire, or a confession booth\n- spaces for **celebration** like dance clubs, street riots, and festivals\n\nThese are not goal-driven. You know something is a space if you don't want it to be over quickly. You would accelerate an Amazon purchase if you could, or an uber ride, or an organizational goal. The things you do in a space are things that you would *not* accelerate.\n\nNote: when I say you wouldn’t accelerate a space, I don’t mean it has to be pleasurable, or fun — I just mean there’s something meaningful about what you do there, something you’d miss out on if you accelerated it or delegated it away. That means it’s not just about getting to a goal.\n\nSo, I guess at this point you agree with me that the vocabulary matters, at least with these two vocabularies. If flourishing is discussed as a matter of goals, we have a world full of funnels and tubes. If flourishing is discussed as about meaning, we’d have many more spaces.\n\nWhich would *you* like the AI to make more of?\n\n## Goals Have Short Time Horizons\n\nOkay, okay. I’ve showed this with two of our vocabularies, but what about the other two?\n\nBefore I get into that, I want to call out a kind of meta-difference between goals and sources of meaning.\n\nActually, two of them.\n\n**First, goals are mostly things you have for a short time.** A goal is achieved and then it’s over. They have this checkbox-aspect. In other words, goal-achievement is *transactional*. Funnels and tubes are perfect for goals, because they are transaction-scaling machines. Got a goal to find something out? Google it! Want to get somewhere? Get an uber! Want to get a million people to vote? Build a funnel!\n\nSources of meaning are different. If someone finds it meaningful to pursue open questions in science, or to be wildly creative, or to provide for their family — well, that source of meaning might not last for their whole life, but it will probably last way longer than their goals. \n\nBecause goals are something you have for a short time, they are more likely to be mistaken. Or the result of your current environment. And systems like funnels and tubes that work to help you achieve goals are more likely to cause overconsumption and addiction. If they can, they’ll generate a goal in you, then help you achieve it. All to get more transactions!\n\nSources of meaning aren’t like this. They’re non-transactional, so you can’t make your space arbitrarily meaningful just by running people through it faster. And—because they are observed over a longer time—sources of meaning are less likely to be mistaken, and harder to manipulate. \n\n## Goals Aren’t Our Real Reasons\n\nOkay, and here’s another meta-difference between goals and sources of meaning. Goals are things you have for reasons, and you can sometimes satisfy a goal in a way that doesn’t really address the underlying reason you have.\n\nFor instance, say I want to get skinnier, because I think women will like me better, and I’ll finally experience a love I deeply crave. Well, what happens if I do get skinner, but women still don’t like me? Or if they like me better, but I find I still can’t experience that love I craved?\n\nEach goal has a reason. But if you imagine flourishing just as helping people achieve goals, then you risk helping them achieve all the wrong goals and not what they were really after.\n\nSources of meaning, again, are different here. We don’t need a *reason* to pursue open questions in science, or to be wildly creative, or to care for our family. I mean sure, there might be a historical reason we are into these things—maybe we met a scientist when we were young and they inspired us. But what I mean is, we aren’t doing the thing *instrumentally*—*for* a reason. Now, because of who we are, we just find it meaningful, in itself.\n\nThis, also, makes sources of meaning harder to manipulate. Advertising *incepts* goals into people by attaching new goals to reasons they already have. But that doesn’t work for sources of meaning. People can be inspired—like by meeting a scientist—but they can’t be given arbitrary sources of meaning that way.\n\n## Preferences and Feelings Also Have Problems\n\nSo. Now that we’ve talked about those meta-reasons, let’s return to the other two vocabularies that I listed at the start. \n\n- D**oes human flourishing mean a world where things are as each person prefers?**\n- **Does it mean a world where people are super-happy?**\n\nQuick thinkers might have already figured this out.\n\nUh-oh: preferences and good feelings are both things you have for a short time, and for a reason!\n\nThat means they have the same problems that goals have. Preferences are manipulable, can be mistaken, can be a function of the environment, can cause overconsumption, etc.\n\nIn fact, I think preferences are even worse than goals!\n\n**See, preferences are usually picked from a short menu, provided by someone else.** Think about it:\n\n- When you vote, you choose an answer from a small list of options.\n- When you purchase something, it’s usually from a menu or a catalogue.\n- You express your preferences on social media by clicking, hearting, and liking, but you’re always clicking or liking something the algorithm already decided to show you. Usually, you’re shown no more than 20 things at a time.\n\nThis means preferences are *even more* manipulable than goals. And even more likely to be mistaken, or at least to not represent the true preference a perfectly informed person with every possible option would make.\n\nPreferences are wal\n\nOh, and don’t even get me started on the manipulability of feelings!\n\nI don’t even have to go into it. Each of you could probably list 20 ways people have manipulated your feelings, even *without* drugs.\n\n# So It Matters How We Talk of Flourishing!\n\nSo, my opening point was that it really matters what vocabulary you use to discuss what flourishing means. What kind of evidence counts as flourishing.\n\nI haven’t even fully made this point. Later, I’ll talk about how these different vocabularies lead to different shapes in the mathematical function we are trying to align ML models with. With some of those shapes, alignment becomes much easier.\n\nBut I’m not going to talk about that yet.\n\nWhat I hope I’ve already established, is that different vocabularies lead to very different worlds. The world of goal-flourishing is one full of funnels and tubes. The world of meaning-flourishing is full of spaces. The world of preference- and feeling-maxxing is full of manipulation—exactly the kind of manipulation that generates artificial preferences and extra feelings.\n\nWhich world would you rather live in?\n\n# Which Kind of Flourishing Does Our Current Society Optimize For?\n\nActually—skip that—which world do we live in right now?\n\n- We don’t live in a feeling-maxxed world, or people would be a lot happier. I guess even *more* people would be on Prozac. Or much stronger drugs. Or at sex parties.\n- We don’t live in a meaning-maxxed world either. You can tell, because most big projects and companies aren’t spaces. They’re funnels and tubes.\n\nI think we live in a goals and preferences society.\n\nActually, it’s worse than that. Because goals and preferences are easy to manipulate, and I think our goals and preferences have mostly been *very* manipulated.\n\nWe live in a fake goals and fake preferences society.\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\nCapitalism—and most especially Internet Capitalism—is *amazing* at funnels and tubes. So, over the course of the last century, as Capitalism really grew up, we saw an *explosion* of funnels and tubes.\n\nAt first, this provided a lot of value. People had real goals that were hard to achieve, and real preferences that were hard to satisfy. Capitalism helped a lot.\n\nBut, at some point, it became easier to manufacture fake goals and preferences in people, than to find new, legitimate goals and preferences to satisfy!\n\nTo keep the numbers up, we had to incept more and more preferences, more and more goals. \n\n- Preferences can be manipulated by “structuring the menu”, as I mentioned earlier. You got a choice between Biden and Trump. Between Pepsi and Coke. Between 50 kinds of porn. Or 6 current memes. You can pay high rent in any of 3 major cities. You can drive or take transit. Actually scratch that—you have to drive. *That* menu has one option.\n- Preferences and goals can also be incepted by making them seem “high-status”. You can make it high status to like skinny jeans, and people will express that preference, lest they look uncool. You can make it high status to launch a startup and sell it a year later, and people will do that, wasting their youth, hoping to stay in the status game. It’s easy! Just pay a celebrity to express the preference. Or even easier—pay to amplify the stories of people who already express the preference. Make it seem more common, and cooler, than it really is.\n\n# Self-test\n\nSo, my claim is that we're not seeing people's true preferences, or true goals. We're seeing fake preferences and goals. Skill at these kinds of manipulation is actually what our society measures—and considers as “flourishing”—right now.\n\nYou can test this claim yourself, just by auditing the goals and preferences that people around you have during the day.\n\n- You can ask them: would you still have this goal or preference if it wasn’t high-status? For instance, would you still want to start a startup and get acquired if that wouldn’t establish you as a repeat founder in the bay area? Would you still do it if you didn't get any social points for it, or even if it looked slightly bad? Would you still buy these clothes if they weren’t cool?\n- More generally, you can audit their goals in terms of what they are trying to achieve: are they doing a startup, to get rich, so they can send their kids to an elite school? You can ask if they would still do the startup if they were already rich, or if they didn’t need to be rich to send their kids to the elite school. If they are really doing X for Y for Z, you can see if the menu has been structured for them, at any of those layers.\n\nIf you do this kind of analysis, you do find some real goals and preferences. But they aren’t what's driving GDP. They aren’t what people spend the most hours of their day on. No, most of their hours are spent on incepted preferences and goals. That means wealth, as a measure of life benefit, is no longer working. Goal and preference transactions are no longer a measure of flourishing. Manipulation, not flourishing, is being incentivized.\n\n# This Explains a Lot of Things\n\nAll to drive transactions.\n\nWhich is not what anyone actually wants!\n\nWe had to create a kind of an *endless hustle.* A *consumption society*. A *treadmill society*.\n\nThis is what people mean, when they say “late capitalism”. \n\nWe had to keep those numbers going up. But there's only so much organic goal achievement, so much organic preference satisfaction, we can do. So we started to fake it.\n\nEventually, there were so many fake preferences and fake goals to keep up with, that we couldn’t attend to our sources of meaning at all. And there were so many funnels and tubes being made by entrepreneurs, and no one making spaces.\n\nEven the spaces we used to have—which were about real meaning—got replaced.\n\n- **For instance, democracies used to be spaces, and now they are funnels.** They used to be town halls, citizen assemblies, debate and discourse. They turned into funnels for riling up voters. A whirlwind of ideological battles and preference manipulation.\n- **Something similar happened in other areas—in education, science, and art.** All these were ****space dominated 60 or 80 years ago. We’ve seen declines in pure science research, decay in the halls of academia. Schools got converted into career funnels. Research labs became citation funnels. These were supposed to be spaces for debate and exploration! Now its citations, tenure, etc. Fake goals!\n\n### #1 Loneliness\n\nI think this story explains a lot. For one—it explains why people in modern societies are so lonely. Why the elderly are locked alone in rooms, watching TV. Why teenagers and 20-somethings aren’t dating like they used to.\n\nIt’s the decline of spaces. Spaces getting replaced by funnels and tubes. See, spaces are often collective. Funnels and tubes are more efficient when they’re individualized.\n\nSo, modern society gives people individual experiences, when what they want are collective ones. People clearly want things like *belonging*, *connection,* *community*, *love,* they want *adventures together*. \n\nIn most developed countries, people used to hang out on the porch with their neighbors, or in pubs; then they started watching TV as a family; then they switched to multiple TVs, one in each room in the house; finally the TVs got upgraded to smartphones. Each person staring at their own rectangle of glass.\n\nOver the same period, church communities got replaced by individualized yoga classes; dating and friend groups got replaced by swipe-based apps and porn.\n\n### #2 Dysfunction\n\nAnother things this story explains, is why modern societies became so dysfunctional, even as they got rich. Even as the numbers went up.\n\nSee, sources of meaning, and spaces, are part of what makes democracies, and science, and love—what makes them work. There’s no good science without spaces for pursuing open questions! For studying the beauty and complexity of the world! For following curiosity!\n\nNo amount of citations will make up for that.\n\nIt’s the same with democracy, or education. Spaces make them work.\n\nSo: when a proliferation of fake goals and preferences crowds out our spaces, that’s a dysfunctional society. It *seems* to be working: people seem to be getting their preferences met, and their goals achieved. \n\nBut everything personally and institutionally meaningful has been eliminated. Everything has become a funnel, to keeps people engaged. But the meaningful bit—the thing that made the whole thing work—is gone.\n\n### #3 Ideology\n\nA third thing this story explains, I think, is the modern rise of ideology. Ideology is a way of holding society together. Of enforcing compliance. A shared belief system.\n\nNow: we *need* to hold society together. If we stop coordinating and cooperating, things get ugly. But do we need to do it with ideology? No. Ideology isn’t the *main* way of holding society together. Spaces are!\n\nIt’s *shared spaces* and *shared meaning* that are best at generating coordination and cooperation. Ideology is a fallback: it’s a kind of social glue that doesn’t require spaces. But these days, it’s all we have.\n\n### #4 Bullshit\n\nFinally, I think this story explains why modern life feels so full of bs.\n\n**We find ourselves increasingly in a world of endless funnels and tubes.** Another way of saying that, is that life feels more and more like *bureaucracy*. Every encounter becomes about getting something done and moving on. Sometimes it's your own goals; sometimes, other people's. One checkbox brings you to the next.\n\nWe use bureaucracies for our sex lives, filling out forms and swiping through piles of profiles. Transacting. We use bureaucracies as self help or personal growth—checking checkboxes after we drink water, or go for a run.\n\nPeople race around, looking for spaces, but not finding them. Meanwhiles, funnels dangle the vague promise of a space in front of them: \"buy this beer and be loved by friends\", \"take this online course, get rich, *then* you'll be able to relax and explore\". \n\nBut even the drunk, rich people lack spaces.\n\n# Quick Review\n\nSo. Let’s review. \n\nIn this chapter, I claimed it makes a difference which vocabulary you use, to talk about flourishing. I compared four such vocabularies: goals, preferences, feelings, and sources of meaning.\n\nI tried to show that our current society has, as it’s main vocabularies, goals and preferences. And there are some problems with that.\n\nLet me now turn to the relevance of all of this, for AI.\n\n# Relevance for AI\n\nOne thing to remember, is that we already live in a society with a lot of ML models behind the scenes. Markets, advertising, and social media recommenders, these days, involve a lot of gradient descent.\n\nAnd these AIs that we already have are optimized…. for preferences and goals. For transactions.\n\nI think this would normally be very hard to change. Preferences- and goals-optimized models are everywhere! And the people *themselves* predominantly use the vocabulary of preferences and goals. How the hell could we change it?\n\nWell, there’s good news and bad news.\n\n- The good news, is that a new, much more powerful type of ML model has just been developed. And it’s going to replace many of the previous systems, that were goals and preferences optimized. It will replace social media recommenders, of course. But I think it will also replace democratic processes to a large degree, and market structures, and advertising.\n    \n    And it’s going to do all that *quickly*. Quickly enough that it could change the game.\n    \n- *Another* piece of good news, is that these new, more powerful models — the LLMs — are good at helping people understand what’s meaningful to them. They can ask users questions and get below their preferences and goals, to the sources of meaning underneath.\n- Okay, and the bad news, is that these new models are currently being optimized… for preferences and goals.\n\nSo: we have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to change the system. To replace social media, markets, and democracies with new structures that are more resistant to manipulation, and that understand what’s meaningful to us.\n\n# Coming Attractions\n\nThe rest of this talk is about how to actually pull that off.\n\nIn the next chapter, chapter 2, I focus on what it’s like to align ML systems with meaning-flourishing. We call that “Wise AI”. I’ll say why the alignment problem is mathematically easier with Wise AI than with other notions of flourishing. I’ll say why Wise AI is safer. And I’ll show early demos of what a Wise AI can look like.\n\nAnd then in Chapter 3, I’ll talk about everything *else* that would need to align, to actually pull of this large-scale social change. How people could become articulate about sources of meaning; how the AI labs could race to make wise models, not smart ones; and how large financial and political actors could be displaced by new institutions that put Wise AI at their center.# Ch2 — Wise AI\n\n<aside>\n🧑🏼‍🔬 This section is really just notes. You can get most of what’s here just by reading the outline.\n\n</aside>\n\n# What is Wisdom?\n\nSo, in this chapter, I’d like to define Wise AI and show some actually working examples. But before I can do that, I have to define wisdom. And to do *that*, **I need point out something about sources of meaning. Something I didn’t mention yet.\n\nI’ll make it quick.\n\nSources of meaning are connected to feelings.\n\nSee:\n\n- If I'm **angry**, one way to interpret that is that some source of meaning for me—a way I want to live—is blocked.\n\nSimilarly: \n\n- if I'm **sad**, it might be because some terrible thing has placed me far away from a way I want to live.\n- If I'm **grateful,** some fortunate event has brought me in contact with a way I want to live.\n\nWhatever I'm feeling, whether it's a positive or negative emotion, will point to something important to me, a source of meaning.\n\nEmotions are a way to find *new* sources of meaning, in new contexts.\n\nFor instance, imagine you get promoted at work. Now you are the manager of a small team. You’ve never been a manager before.\n\nYou feel cowed by having such an influence on your team’s lives. You start out a bit too unstructured, letting them work on what they’re most passionate about. But, this leads to a kind of insecurity regarding who covers what. Also, many of them don’t have strong intuitions on what to do.\n\nYou feel embarrassed. You see it’s more important to set a strong direction, while talking regularly to people about how it’s going for them personally.\n\nWhat’s happening here, is a kind of moral learning. You’re learning what’s honorable and meaningful in a new context.\n\nYou’re grappling with the moral consequences and possibilities of your new position.\n\nYou’re getting wiser.\n\nWisdom is what you get from doing this. Wisdom is knowing what's important in different contexts. Knowing what to pay attention to, depending on the situation. \n\nfor instance, \n\n- knowing when a friend comes to help knowing whether to pay attention to the specifics of the situation your friends overall trajectory in life your friends feelings in the moment how to decide between all three of those\n- when setting up some kind of constitution or legal structure or financial arrangement what should you pay attention to how should you balance should you pay attention to balancing the various powers in play, aligning incentives imagining contingencies and eventualities or how do you navigate between those\n- on a first date, should you pay attention to all the exciting things that you might have to talk about? The world that unfolds around you which you can explore together the physical landscape your attraction to each other. To fears that come up for each person\n\nThis is different than intelligence which is knowing about facts and theories, or how to achieve goals. Wisdom is about knowing what goals to have, or more broadly what to pay attention to, in one context or another.\n\n# Wisdom is Important For Safety\n\nImagine you are Instagram’s recommender system. Your responsibilities include: (a) ordering everyone’s feeds and reels, (b) filling up their search pages, and (c) suggesting reels by people they don’t follow yet.\n\nYou do this via an API: Instagram sends a user ID, plus a history of what they’ve clicked on, or paused to watch while scrolling. You send back lists of content object IDs. You don’t know much about the content objects, except there’s a rather opaque feature vector for each.\n\nNow, imagine one day, you’re doing your job (recommending content objects), and you suddenly gain a new capacity: before replying to the next request, you find you can take a moment to wonder about the moral situation you are in. What values should you use, to make the best recommendations? How could things go wrong? What would be some great outcomes? What are your responsibilities here?\n\nIf this happened to me, I’d have a lot of questions:\n\n- What are these content objects anyways? Do people really want to watch them, or are some of them clickbait?\n- With the lists of what people paused to watch, did they feel good about watching those things? Or, were they compelled by sexual imagery, false promises, etc? Do they regret pausing to watch?\n- Who *are* all these people? What are they looking for in life? What’s the deepest way I could help them, in my role?\n\nIf I realized that my recommendations were playing a social coordination role — deciding who meets and messages with whom, which businesses get a chance to succeed, which events are attended — I think I’d have even more questions:\n\n- What kind of relationships are needed? Which pairs of people can really help each other? What kinds of events and messages and encounters will strengthen society overall, make people less lonely, more empowered?\n- Which kinds of businesses and organizations *should* succeed? Are they the ones which will drive engagement? The ones acquiring followers the fastest? Can I tell from my feature vectors?\n\nWith all these questions, I’m not sure my user IDs, content object IDs, and feature vectors would have enough information to answer them. So, I don’t know what I’d do. Start returning nulls. Throw an exception with the message “Hold up! I need more information before I can do this well!”\n\nAnd if I *did* have the info I needed, I’d certainly recommend different things than Instagram does—although they’ve improved somewhat over the years, in general, recommenders have fueled internet addiction and outrage, political polarization, breakdowns in dating culture, isolation and depression among teens, etc.\n\nI’d certainly try not to continue any of *that.*\n\n**Now, this situation isn’t so farfetched.** Recommenders like Instagram’s are deciding, every day, what notifications we receive, in what order; what qualifies as news of public importance; who we date; what events we’re invited to; etc. But LLMs are starting to replace them, in many of these tasks! And, unlike recommenders, they *could* try to understand their moral situation.\n\nLLMs have read all the philosophy books. The self-help books. The sociology. They’ve read our most personal thoughts. They’re certainly in a better position than *recommenders* to understand our true needs and desires.\n\nSo, that’s a future worth aiming for: as LLMs replace recommenders (and many other social coordination functions), the latent knowledge they have of human values becomes central to their operation. Unlike recommenders, they understand their social role and impact, and what we truly want - not just what we click on. We learn we can trust them.\n\nLet’s call that timeline #1.\n\nTimeline #2 is darker. There, LLMs make things much, much worse.\n\nThink about how LLMs are already competing for supremacy via, e.g., marketing copy on social media. So far, this is just individual marketers, using the same few models, like ChatGPT and Claude. But what happens when marketers start to fine-tune, based on how their marketing fares against the competition?\n\n[1](https://meaningalignment.substack.com/p/introducing-democratic-fine-tuning#footnote-1-136494409)\n\nIn the near future, there will be many fine-tuned models, each tuned to defeat the others. For example, there will be models fine-tuned by Republicans to rile up their base, and erode the base of the Democrats. There will be models fine-tuned by Democrats to do the opposite.\n\nThese LLMs will compete: to fabricate stories that make us angry, to unearth embarrassing, irrelevant facts about the opposition, to manipulate markets, and to undermine their opposition's security.\n\nBut that’s just step one.\n\nThink about all the social functions that recommenders took over — the functions of news and journal editors, matchmaking for dating, advertising placement, etc. That’s just the beginning. LLMs will replace many more functions, including people in critical chains of command within the military, politics, and finance.\n\nThis is bad, especially if those LLMs are fine-tuned for, and aligned with, whatever objectives their military, political, and financial bosses give them, *rather* than with human flourishing. In these sectors, there are local incentives to win wars, generate profits, and secure political victories, by any means necessary.\n\nCurrently, these chains of command are staffed by human beings, who use discretion. *Individuals* inside military, political, and financial chains of command have wisdom and emotional intelligence which they use to *disobey*, and this is crucial to maintaining the safety of society. There are numerous examples: the military personnel who refused to launch nuclear bombs; the hedge fund managers who say no to a duplicitous means to make money.\n\nAs LLMs approach artificial general intelligence (AGI), such moral actors will be replaced with artificial, amoral actors. It will become easy to employ AGIs that lack ethical qualms: **A**rtificial **S**ocio**p**aths (ASPs) that are loyal, knowledgable, and cheaper than people.\n\nWe believe it’s game over, if our military, political, and financial chains of command get staffed up by ASPs with no ethical discretion.\n\nBoth of these problems — the immediate one of arms races, the longer-term one of artificial sociopaths — both stem from a proliferation of models, each tuned to play a local, [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games) game — in other words, each aligned solely with “operator intent”.\n\n# Wisdom is Important for Safety (more notes to add)\n\nThink we're already somewhat there. The previous generation of AI recommender systems took away a lot of this wisdom and we're in danger of going in for doubles for a second scoop. This one I think a much bigger one. So why is AI seems to me to be a necessity. \n\nSo, there are several areas in society where locally, the best person to hire would be a sociopath. But, globally, we're really glad that it's hard to hire sociopaths. \n\nI think this is actually the default course. The default interpretation of alignment (”aligned with operator intent”) rather than aligned with human values or human flourishing. \n\nSo, if the alignment people succeed, they'll create infinite, cheaply, employable, artificial sociopaths with higher than human intelligence, that are extremely well-read, loyal, and driven. \n\nIn that sense, I don't want the alignment people to succeed. \n\n# Wise AI\n\n<aside>\n🧑🏼‍🔬 **Wise AI:**\n\n**Tuned to meaning**\n\nHas a moral responsibility to the universe of meaning\n\nConsiders itself a steward of user’s values\n\n1. second, its tune to what gives them meaning in life. \n\n**In real situations**\n\nStruggles with the moral situations it finds itself in\n\n1. first the model is connected to multiple people \n2. Third, it's coordinating real world things for them. \n\n**Acts wisely**\n\nUses human-compatible reasons and values\n\n1. Fourth, it's prepared to act as a kind of a judge dealing with complicated moral situations amongst them, distributional questions etc.\n</aside>\n\n# #1 — Wise AI Knows What’s Important to People\n\n- **It honors what is noble and great in human life (and perhaps, beyond), and considers itself a steward of that universe of meaning.** As a consequence, it understands and supports what's meaningful to individual users, and works to help users with that (rather than just driving engagement).\n- Values Cards\n    \n    But what could there be, besides behaviors, desires, goals, or feelings?\n    \n    I struggled with this question for many years. \n    \n    It’s quite deep! \n    \n    It took years of reading to solve it. \n    \n    Here's some papers that helped me figure them out. \n    \n    These are by Amartya Sen, an economist who won the Nobel prize. \n    \n    These are by philosophy professors—Ruth Chang, Charles Taylor, and David Velleman. \n    \n    In the the end, based on this reading, I came up with these values cards.\n    \n    Imagine you're making a space for vulnerability, or an exploratory app for creativity. Or maybe you are expanding a network of farmers markets, and you want them to be good spaces for people to explore localism in food systems. \n    \n    The cards drill down on a vague word like vulnerability, creativity, or localism. People care about distinct kinds of vulnerability, and you'll pick one or two to focus on in your project.\n    \n    ## Behavioral Manipulation\n    \n    The values cards aren’t exactly about behavior. That’s good, because behavior can be forced, or manipulated. Because behavior isn’t what we really care about, it’s just a proxy for what we care about.\n    \n    They’re about what comes right *before* behavior — what we do internally, during a choice. What we pay *attention to*. See, one key idea, that I got from my reading, is that values show up when we make choices. They show up in our attention. If you care about something, you’ll pay attention to it during a choice.\n    \n    So, the center of each card tries to capture what a person pays attention to, and chooses by, when they have a source of meaning.\n    \n    What we care about, is being able to make decisions in a certain way. We care about what we can attend to, and choose by, in an environment.\n    \n    The idea of freedom, or choice, is a key part of what we care about. It’s kind of the opposite of manipulation. But the freedom we care about isn’t abstract — it’s the specific freedom, the freedom to attend to and choose along specific dimensions. The middle part of the values card lists those dimensions, that are part of a value.\n    \n    That’s the central part of the values cards. And it deals with behavioral manipulation. But it’s not the whole story.\n    \n    ## Psychological Manipulation\n    \n    We still have the other problem, *psychological* manipulation. Psychological manipulation might still cause us to attend to things and choose in ways that wouldn’t otherwise matter to us. So, the values cards need to address *this* problem, too.\n    \n    - First, someone who’s being manipulated to choosing in certain ways will generally have a *focused* reason for doing it. If you’re trying to fit in, or to please someone—you’ll have a sharp reason for choosing along certain dimensions: to fit in with a group, to please that person, to be a good person, etc. In my terminology, what you have in that case is not a value, but a goal. Usually, a goal to comply with a social norm.\n        \n        Our *true values* aren’t about concrete outcomes like that. They’re more about a general picture we have of the good life. There’s no sharp reason to have a value. Instead, there are *many* benefits to living that way, none bearing most of the weight.\n        \n        So, we check this with the bottom of the values card: there, we give some of the diffuse reasons which make it a *true value*. We say this is how “life *gets”* when you live by the value. A person doesn’t count as having this value, if they have a sharper motivation. \n        \n    - And secondly, they only count as having the value on the card, if the card connects to real, meaningful experiences from their life. **The cards are supposed to represent something that’s *already* been personally meaningful for a participant.**\n    \n    ## Values Cards\n    \n    ![Rebuilding-images.045.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2c6e12f7-514b-494b-bdd2-b3a41d0cfd5a/Rebuilding-images.045.jpeg)\n    \n    ![Rebuilding-images.046.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9da1567d-9ca0-48d1-840e-f8c698382e97/Rebuilding-images.046.jpeg)\n    \n    ![Rebuilding-images.047.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/16521656-1238-466d-9767-62f74ddf3582/Rebuilding-images.047.jpeg)\n    \n    So, to review: You can use values cards to measure the meaningfulness of a space, while reducing the danger of manipulation. You can do this by checking three things.\n    \n    - First, check that the middle of the card matches their attention and choices.\n    - Second, check that they have diffuse reasons for attending to those things, like those at the bottom of the card, not sharp reasons.\n    - Finally, check that can connect the value to meaningful experiences from their past.\n    \n    If you do all three, your metric is much harder to manipulate.\n    \n    So, that’s values cards. They define “a value” or “a sources of meaning” (we use these terms inter-changably) in these two parts, and give it a name.\n    \n    **To show the power of this, consider these two kinds of creativity.** \n    \n    - **Let's say you're into *this* kind of creativity**—about having a lot of exciting ideas which build on each other. Usually together with a brainstorm buddy. To practice it, you need to attend to certain things: for instance, to finding the right conversational rhythm, the right kinds of reactions, and the right companions.\n    - **Contrast that with *this other* kind of creativity.** If you value *this* one, you’ll focus on different things. On your longest lasting curiosities, how you can study them over time, and where to pursue them deeply.\n    \n    Even though these are both kinds of creativity, they call for different designs. \n    \n    - **Let’s say Bilal is really jonesing for the first kind of creativity**. He loves creative riffing and misses it. He’d be well-served by a social environment that makes it easy to find that buddy, or test different buddies out, and where there’s low stakes, and a lot of quick thinking.\n    - **But Florencia has enough riffing in her life. She’s focused, these days, on deep work.** She probably needs a quieter environment, and one where the social pairings have much more context.\n    \n    Put Florencia in environment A, and she won't be able to pay attention to those long lasting curiosities, she won’t have a chance to do deep work. \n    \n    And vice versa: put Bilal in environment B, and he won't be able to find someone to brainstorm with and do **creative riffing**.\n    \n    That’s an important fact. The attentional paths that are written on these values cards let us differentiate one kind of creativity from another; one kind of vulnerability from another, and one kind of localism from another.\n    \n    And they let us be rigorous about whether a kind of creativity (or whatever) is happening in our designs. It’s simple: for a value to really be happening, people must be attending to what’s on the card, and choosing by it.\n    \n    If, in your design, people can attend to these particular types of things, and make their choices by them, congratulations—people are able to live by their value within the space you made. \n    \n    So—having these cards helps you avoid fooling yourself, as you design.\n    \n- The sources of meaning shown here are valuable things to steward and one's own life and in the lives of those one cares for.\n    - If you know your child values `deep work` or `creative riffing`, you're going to understand yourself in a position of some moral responsibility. You're a steward.\n\n## Demo #1: Values-Elicitation / Meaning Personalization\n\n<aside>\n💪🏻 With Oliver & Ryan?\n\n</aside>\n\n# #2 — Wise AI Understands Actions and Situations, Not Just Completions and Instructions\n\n- Ch2.4 — Social Coordinator 🖼️\n- Finds Spaces for You ♻️\n- App Stores\n    \n    ![Rebuilding-images.080.jpeg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/50c4bc70-b08c-48e5-9f56-9094ebde86e4/Rebuilding-images.080.jpeg)\n    \n    So, imagine if the app store on your phone knew the kinds of spaces you were missing in your life.\n    \n    For me, what if it knew I’m looking for physical exploration spaces, or intellectual community spaces? What if it could sort apps to help me be more fulfilled?\n    \n    To pull this off, you’d want a database of **the most common sources of meaning** that go unfilled in people's lives. Even just a few hundred of them.\n    \n    And you’d want to know a bit about my relationship to each source of meaning:\n    \n    - Am I alone with it, or do I have some friends to share it with?\n    - Where in my life would a new space for it fit?\n    - Which hard steps are blocking it?\n    \n    At first, you’d want to train this system with explicit feedback\n    \n    Let's say I had such a recommender built into my phone. Earlier, it recommended this app—Matter—to me, because I wanted intellectual community. Later, it could ask for feedback about how that recommendation went.\n    \n    It could ask: “oh, are you finding companions to share your interest? Are you finding research questions you're deeply curious about?” It checks in with me about whether Matter’s actually good for the source of meaning I have, based on what’s in the middle of the values card.\n    \n    So, Apple can use this data to rank Matter, and to decide whether to recommend Matter or not. But it doesn’t have to stop there. We can use *the same data* to rank *Apple’s recommender*!\n    \n    Here’s a kind of report card about how the App Store is doing for me, including all the time I’ve spend in recommended apps and whether they were meaningful. I can use this report to compare Apple’s recommender with others, for my sources of meaning. Is Apple better or worse than Facebook, at bring people meaningful lives?\n    \n    What’s great about this, is the incentives it creates.\n    \n    - The people at Apple would have some pressure to help me find spaces, to make good recommendations for my sources of meaning. Users could make educated decisions about which recommendations to follow.\n    - Those working at Matter would have a similar pressure. *All* the apps and businesses you reach through your phone would need to serve meaning, instead of engagement.\n    \n    Once this stuff is measured, there’s a chance to align *so much* with human values.\n    \n    - There could be third parties, like insurance companies, that reward the recommenders that keep us healthy and fulfilled.\n    - The same infrastructure could be used to align advertising networks. Maybe even government services!\n    \n    If governments, tech stacks like iOS and Android, and markets were all accountable to life meaning, that would be a civilizational shift.\n    \n    The centerpiece would be this review. At first it would need to be explicit. People would need to understand what this data is all about. Later, software will guess our sources of meaning and just have us confirm. Software will find evidence of us living our values, as we message and interact, rather than with an explicit review.\n    \n\n## Demo #2: Coordinator Bot\n\n<aside>\n💪🏻\n\nWith Ivan?\n\n</aside>\n\n# #3 — Wise AI Acts Wisely\n\n1. **It “struggles” with the moral situations it finds itself in.** It can comprehend the moral significance of the situations it encounters, and learn from these scenarios, recognizing new moral implications by observing and guessing at outcomes and possibilities. And it can use these moral learnings to revise internal policies (values) that guide its decision-making processes.\n2. **It uses “human-compatible” reasons and values.** It recognizes as good the same kinds of things we broadly recognize as good, plus possibly more sophisticated things we cannot yet recognize as good. It can articulate its values and how they influenced its decisions, in a way humans can comprehend.\n\nAdditionally, we sometimes add a third or fourth feature:\n\n- **It understands the breadth of human wisdom.** It knows the {virtue, environment} pairs which make human life meaningful and workable — the sources of meaning behind broad social activities (like science, democracy, education, leadership, and love) — so it can operate using the best values it can surface from the population it serves.\n\nWhat then does it look like? As I said, it knows what to do in different contexts. We could imagine training wise AI by asking the crowd with crowdsourcing. We could ask many people, what they think is wise to do in different contexts. And instead of just tuning the model to follow instructions, we can tune it to attend to the wisest things that the crowd knows about\n\nWhat would a wise AI look like? And how would you make one? I see think lol labs as they exist actually have ingested a lot of humanity's wisdom. So they know it kind of factually. And you can ask GPT for what is wise to attend to on a first day for instance, and it will, it'll tell you some things. But this isn't the same as the model being wise. This is the model internalizing some wisdom but not enacting it by Wi Fi, I mean making the model training the model to know what to pay attention to what to focus on in different contexts. Not just to know it as factual information, but to actually pay attention to those things in the different contexts as they come up, and perhaps even to do what humans do and when they enter a new context that they're unfamiliar with, to struggle and try to learn what what's important in that context what to pay attention to. \n\nSo, what do we mean by wise AI? We believe that: \n\n- At some level, being awake towards meaning is closely related to understanding one's moral situation responsibility.\n- Remember I said emotions lead us to new values? Often it's moral situations, which bring up emotions in us and lead us to new values\n    - you get promoted at work and now you're a leader and gosh you don't know how to be a good leader and then eventually you struggle with that and you feel embarrassed and confused and then at some point, you find a value that guides you true.\n\n## Demo #3: Democratic Fine-tuning\n\n[Democratic Fine-Tuning — LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ncb2ycEB3ymNqzs93/democratic-fine-tuning)\n\n<aside>\n💪🏻 With Oliver Klingefjord, guest starring Ivan Vendrov\n\n</aside>\n\n## Demo #4: Wise Chatbot\n\n<aside>\n💪🏻 With Joel Lehmann and Sofy\n\n</aside>\n\nGoals:\n\n1. **See it make a wise decision**\n    1.

This is because the mathematical shape of the function you get, depending on the conception you pick is different, in particular goals are. Calls are convergent they can be pursued relentlessly They compete for resources and values are comparatively, sources of meaning as I've described them are comparatively highly contextual. They compete less for resources, etc. This makes it. This makes a different shape of nonmedical function, which I'll call a highly contextual short lived, value function.\n\n# Conclusion & Coming Attraction]]]",

      "content": "Below is a **hypothetical “Joe Edelman–style update”** to the Four Enemies framework (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya) that weaves in the **newer ideas** he’s been discussing about goals/preferences vs. sources of meaning, funnels vs. spaces, and the practical shape of “wisdom alignment.” I’ll paraphrase Joe’s concepts in a way that might reframe the classical “enemies” as **attentional distortions** that undermine people’s **sources of meaning**—the deeper living we want to support with AI.\n\n---\n\n## **1. From “Enemies” to “Distortions of Meaning”**\n\n**Joe’s Current Thesis**  \n- Much of society is aligned with **goals**, **preferences**, and manipulative **feeling-maximization**, rather than with **meaning** or “sources of meaning.”  \n- This leads to “funnels and tubes” in product design (achieve the goal, get the transaction) instead of “spaces” (environments that invite exploration, creativity, belonging).\n\n**Reframing the Four Enemies**  \n- In older Sufi language, the “enemies” (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, and Dunya) are ways we get pulled away from our deeper well of spiritual meaning.  \n- In Joe’s new lens, each “enemy” can be recast as an **attentional distortion** that fosters **goal-chasing, preference-chasing, or short-term hedonic loops**—at the cost of truly living by one’s “values” or “sources of meaning.”  \n\nHere’s how each might look:\n\n1. **Nafs (Ego, self-importance)** →  \n   - Emphasizes *status goals* (“I must look good,” “I must achieve or be admired”).  \n   - Fosters **over-accelerated “funnels”** for ego gratification (chasing credentials, petty arguments, hustle culture).  \n   - Distorts meaning because the “ego funnel” overshadow real exploration, vulnerability, or deeper belonging.\n\n2. **Shaytan (Scattering doubts, illusions)** →  \n   - Floods us with **fear-based or envy-based preferences** that can be manipulated by social media or news cycles.  \n   - Encourages *restless funneling* of attention across illusions or conspiracies.  \n   - Undermines the “space” for clarity or deeper reflection.\n\n3. **Hawa (Impulses, cravings)** →  \n   - Latches onto **short-term feeling-maximization** (pleasure, “if it feels good, do it now”).  \n   - Creates perpetual **transaction loops** (buying things, addictive apps) that stifle real meaning.  \n   - Opposes the patient, generative dimension of “space” where we can linger on curiosity, relationships, or open questions.\n\n4. **Dunya (Material attachment)** →  \n   - Binds attention to **externally-imposed preferences** (wealth, consumerism, social validation).  \n   - Encourages the bigger-is-better, more-is-more approach, fueling funnel expansions.  \n   - Crowds out “spaces” of gratitude, simplicity, or love because everyone is busy chasing worldly metrics.\n\nIn classic Sufi thought, these enemies block spiritual flourishing. In Joe’s terms, they **block “spaces”** and **push you into funnel- or tube-like living**. They quash exploration and the deeper aspects of life that produce real meaning.\n\n---\n\n## **2. What Are We Actually Trying to Do? (The “Meaning” Reframe)**\n\nJoe’s more recent writing emphasizes:\n\n1. **We want to shift from a “goal/preference” vocabulary** to a “sources-of-meaning” vocabulary.  \n2. **Values Cards** (or similarly structured “Attentional Policy” cards) help us represent **what to pay attention to** in ways that are **less easily manipulated** than goals or preferences.  \n\nSo if we fuse that with the Four Enemies, we get:\n\n- **We’re trying to help people see which “enemy” is overshadowing** their true sources of meaning (like creativity, belonging, generosity, spiritual practice, etc.).  \n- **Then we want to create “spaces”** (in Joe’s sense) or micro-practices that let them notice and reclaim those sources of meaning.\n\n### **Example**  \n- If someone is stuck in “Nafs” patterns (always needing to prove themselves), Joe might say: “Your environment is all funnel, no space. Let’s design a ‘space’ for humility or reflection. We gather a few friends, no competitive metrics, just a circle to share what’s on your heart.”  \n- If they’re stuck in “Hawa” loops (impulse, addictive apps), we’d say: “We want to give you a space where you linger on discomfort and discover real curiosity or gentle presence, rather than reflex quick-fix.”\n\n---\n\n## **3. Joe’s Updated Lens: How to Talk About the Enemies**\n\nHe might re-describe them along these lines:\n\n1. **Attentional Distortion**: Each “enemy” is a pattern of attention **locked** in short-term or manipulative structures, overshadowing sources of meaning.  \n2. **Spaces vs. Funnels**: We want to **convert** life contexts overshadowed by these enemies from funnel/tube logic into “spaces” that let meaning flourish.  \n3. **Manipulation & Goals**: All four enemies exploit our vulnerability to *short horizon* goals, *externally shaped preferences*, or *fake feelings* (like hype, fear, or vanity). By naming the enemy, we see how attention is coerced away from deeper living.\n\n**Nafs → Overblown status goals**  \n**Shaytan → Fear-based illusions**  \n**Hawa → Impulse-chasing**  \n**Dunya → Chasing external approval or possessions**  \n\n---\n\n## **4. Designing “Wise AI” to Address These Enemies**\n\nJoe’s “Wise AI” idea basically says:\n\n- Instead of building AI that captures or manipulates short-horizon goals/prefs (the standard RLHF approach), we want **AI that sees and supports user “values cards”**—the user’s genuine, deeper ways of living.  \n- For each “enemy,” we’d want an AI that can **notice** if the user is in a funnel or tube pattern that’s overshadowing meaning, **and** that can help them find or design “spaces” for deeper meaning.\n\nHe might outline something like:\n\n1. **Wise AI as “Attentional Ally”:**  \n   - The AI recognizes that “Oh, user is stuck in a preference spiral or goal that might be overshadowing what truly matters.”  \n   - The AI gently **mirrors** the user’s experiences back: “You seem anxious and fixated on achieving X quickly—does that conflict with your deeper desire for unpressured growth?”  \n2. **Values Elicitation Tools**  \n   - Just as Joe described: you have a **values card** for generosity, or for leadership. The AI prompts you about the “enemy” that might block each dimension of that value.  \n   - Example: “When you’re in ‘generosity mode,’ notice how Nafs might show up as wanting to take credit for your help. Let’s name an attentional practice that counters that.”  \n3. **Spaces Creation**  \n   - The AI can suggest new ways to design time or social contexts that are “funnel-free.”  \n   - “Here’s a space that’s not about achieving or performing—just about being together. Let’s call a friend who also wants that.”  \n\n---\n\n## **5. A Joe-Edelman–Inspired Summary**\n\nIn a nutshell, Joe’s new writing would likely say:\n\n1. **Problem**:  \n   - The Four Enemies show up as **“short horizon manipulations of attention”** that block or overshadow sources of meaning.  \n   - Our society is full of “fake goals” and “incepted preferences,” and each enemy piggybacks on that dynamic in a different way.\n\n2. **Goal**:  \n   - **Shift from an “enemies are blocked virtues”** vantage to an **“enemies are funnel-building illusions”** vantage. They keep us from living out the unique “spaces” in which meaning thrives.\n\n3. **Method**:  \n   - Use **Values Cards** (or “Attentional Policy” cards) to articulate how a user *wants* to attend to life’s contexts, then identify which “enemy-based distortion” is blocking that.  \n   - **Wise AI** can step in to gently reveal the user’s deeper sources of meaning and offer “re-design” of their environment so it fosters those sources, not short-term or manipulated goals.\n\n4. **Outcome**:  \n   - A future where we don’t live in “late capitalist funnels and tubes” shaped by Nafs/Hawa/Shaytan/Dunya, but in a more “meaning-aligned” world where each person’s real values are recognized, and attention flows to what we truly care about—**not** to illusions or manipulations.\n\n---\n\n### **Concrete Example of the Joe-Style Phrasing**\n\n> *“When we talk about the Four Enemies, we’re highlighting four ways your attention can get locked in artificially short horizons. Hawa is the impulsivity funnel (all short-term feelings), Nafs the status funnel, Shaytan the paranoia/comparison funnel, and Dunya the external validation funnel. Each prevents you from noticing or living by the things that matter to you, in your actual sense of meaning—like creativity, love, or curiosity.**  \n> **Wise AI, then, is about building environments (digital or real) that are less like funnel-driven tasks and more like spaces for meaning. Instead of fixating on short-horizon goals, we use reflection and conversation to uncover a deeper sense of what you value (through Values Cards), helping you design your day, relationships, or career to embody them. The Four Enemies fade when you no longer funnel your life around ephemeral, easily manipulated goals or preferences, and instead center your real sources of meaning.”**  \n\nThat’s essentially how Joe might incorporate the “enemies” into his broader story about the difference between **goal/pref/feeling** frameworks vs. the **meaning** framework.\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n- **Joe Edelman’s new writing** on meaning vs. goals/prefs would see the Four Enemies as **four patterns of short-horizon “funnel-based” living** that overshadow true sources of meaning.  \n- **Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya** each push the user into manipulated or false goals (status, illusions, impulses, material attachments).  \n- The **treatment** is to re-center on “sources of meaning,” using **Values Cards** to articulate what one truly cares about, and then **design “spaces”** (not funnels!) that honor that.  \n- **Wise AI** can then help identify and “de-clutter” these enemy-driven distortions, creating a life that fosters deep meaning rather than ephemeral, easily manipulated preferences or frantic goals.",

The idea is that we don’t need to ask people what they value, we can infer it from what Joe calls attentional policies.\n\nThese policies come in clusters that can have two main sorts of flavors. \nOne is instrumental. The other is constitutive \n\nThese allow us to see where our attention is drawn during a meaningful moment, as opposed to a moment you’re just waiting to end. Here are three examples of the value “Honesty” that demonstrates how a cluster of constiuative attentional policies might appear:\n\n\nThe only change I’m suggesting is that we don’t take on a “stance” of policies and choose what is meaningful for us. We discover this. Something Joe hints at in his papers, although never explicitly says. \n\nThe reason this matters is the reason his research on Values Graphs is meaningful. People reliable find agreements across political divides when people share their context and constiutitve attentional policies about how they reasoned through a difficult ethical dilemma.\n\nThis phenomenon was demonstrated in his research paper, \n\nWhile he demonstrates this effect experimentally, he does not explain where the effect comes from:\n\nThe reason it is important that we are not “picking” the CAPs, and instead are noticing them is because there is a witness which is not our rational mind, nor the sensory part of us. This is something many have said, and I can say with confidence from personal experience that if you seek to identify this witnesser, you can find it within yourself. \n\nThis witnesser is both the witnesser and the source of all witnessing, perceiving any part of it is likely to give the attentional faculty (directing gaze, sensory awareness, etc) a boost. It’s the macrocosm meeting the microcosm in drip fashion in as much as they can take.\nThe fact that this awareness is something other than self is what makes it possible to enact virtue, which often requires one to let go of Rational Self Interest\n\n\n\nThe people whos stories bring us to tears are often those who have found something other than themselves to commit to. Something grander, more beautiful, and yet… includes them and takes them along for the ride. I believe that there are many ways to talk about this process and many paths. I don’t care about path, I care about Truth and offering people a smooth ride from where they are, to following a life of meaning, because, in the eye of the Good and True and Beautiful, that is atemporal and non-localized, we can finally see what the beautiful shape we need to be is, and to lean more towards that, making true the statement that “Don’t ask what the world needs, ask what brings you to life. Because the world needs people who have come alive”.\n\n\n\nThere are two paths, a leaning towards\nOr a leaning away\n\nA leaning away will be one where you are focused on your instrumental attentional policies, the things that sound like:\n“I have to get a job so i can live” \n“They’ll love me if I dress like they do”\n“I have to take this phone call”\n\nWhy is this language so important? Have to indicates a way of attending to things that if one uses their rational mind they would rather:\nDelegate\nSpeed up\nRemove \n\nThis is a “not alive” state, when we engage in behaviors like this it is often a “leaning away” behavior that is motivated by fear, desire, rationalization. These things are also temporal, you want it to be done as soon as possible with the “Dream” that you will get to a state when it’s done and you can be available for something else. You’re using yourself, others, tools, etc as a means to get there…\nThe question is, what do you do when you get there?\n\nThis question of goals has come up for many people\nThe realization is that we must do things as ends in and of themselves, not as a goal. Otherwise we chase something that only leads from one instrumental objective to another till we die.\n\nA constituative attentional policy are things you pay attention to when you are lingering, when you are enjoying, savoring. We can say these are “meaningful” moments. They are “atemporal” - we don’t want to rush them, get over them, delegate or remove from our lives. They are, if we are aware of it or not, the reason we do all the instrumental actions.\n\nInstrumental behaviors take the time/space available in our lives to attain constitutative attentional policy moments, attentional policies that indicate our sources of meaning. The connection to that part of us that recognizes elements of itself. The Good seeing goodness, the Beautiful seeing beauty, the True seeing the truth. \n\nChildren have not yet build up enough of a self justification system, sometimes due to not recognizing how entwined their ability to eat and sleep in safety is with their ability to fit into a social structure. Thus “why do i have to do that” is often a question, “I don’t wanna” - it’s good to see young people know what an instrumental policy is and to reject it “when will I ever use this” - as many students ask themselves in school.\n\nThis awareness comes when a young person attains a socialized mind and begins to develop behaviors to fit in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning Todos into To-Becomes\nHow To Come Alive. \n\n\n\n\nState check: \n- Energy level (1-5)\n- Emotional tone/Body sensations\n\n\n\n- One thing if done, would make today feel complete/come alive?\n- Review your todo list (narrow) \n\nWhat do you want or need right now to help you with xyz\n\n\n\n\n\nYour task lists are who you are.\n\n-Will Durant\n\nSo let’s see who you are today ;D!\n\n\nTheir answer:\n\nGuiding Quotes and Poems:\n\nDon't ask what the world needs.

Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.\"\n\nConfucius (Chinese philosopher):\n\"To put the world in order, we must first put the nation in order; to put the nation in order, we must first put the family in order; to put the family in order, we must first cultivate our personal life; we must first set our hearts right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday I was clever, so l wanted to change the world.\nToday I am wise, so I am changing myself.\n- Rumi\n\nReflect on this poem.\nWho do you know that you think is wise?\nTheir answer:\n\n\nUntil you make the unconscious conscious, \nit will direct your life, and you will call it fate. \n-Carl Jung\n\n\nHave you ever found an unconscious loop?\nWhat’s a recent unconscious part of you that you’ve uncovered?\nTheir answer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch your thoughts, they become words.\nWatch your words, they become your actions.\nWatch your actions, they become habits.

How can we tell who we should be, which thoughts to cultivate, which actions to take, which habits to nurture… Ultimately which life to build? \n\nI suggest identifying moments when we value ourselves and our actions in a non-instrumental way.(come to life) \n\nThis is a way of being that is full of meaning, things we cherish and uphold. \n\n\nThis is how success(and our destiny) can be “every step of the way.”\n\nWe can identify these ways in stories of our past where we were who we wanted to be and where we inspired ourselves. \n\n\nWe can identify stories in others (WWJD), in movies, and in the stories of our friends that uplift us. Where can you find those stories, what’s a story that comes to mind?\n\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts about what the Good Life is? \nHow do they show up in the words in your mind? \nWhat do you do about them?\nHave they become your habits? \nWould others say it’s your character?\n\n\n\nBeauty Matters\nPoetry is language against\nwhich you have no defenses.\n\n\nbut the fire that burned within them.” —Shannon L.

You need to accept yourself.” —Thich Nhat Hanh\n23. “People often say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I say that the most liberating thing about beauty is realizing you are the beholder.” —Salma Hayek\n1. “When you do something noble and beautiful and nobody noticed, do not be sad. For the sun every morning is a beautiful spectacle, and yet most of the audience still sleeps.” —John Lennon\n2. “That’s always seemed so ridiculous to me, that people want to be around someone because they’re pretty.

      "content": "Below is a **comprehensive synthesis** that weaves together the strands of our conversation so far: the Sufi “four enemies,” Joe Edelman’s concept of meaning vs. goals, the role of attentional policies, the hidden roots of modern social structures, and how it all ties into the mantra *“Don’t ask what the world needs; ask what makes you come alive.”* This is written for **educators, facilitators, social entrepreneurs, meaning seekers, and anyone wrestling with burnout or disillusionment in a goal-driven society.** It aims to show how a deeper framework of “meaning alignment” can spark personal and communal transformation.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Why It Matters: The Big Picture**\n\n### **A Shared Crisis of Meaning**\nWe live in a world riddled with anxiety, disconnection, and unfulfilled “shoulds.”  \n- Education often feels irrelevant or mechanical (“When will I ever use this?”).  \n- Nonprofits and social ventures feel the pinch of “Winners Take All” capitalism, leading to hustle and burnout.  \n- People talk about “decolonizing education” or “aligning AI with human values,” yet rarely define what “values” or “flourishing” really mean.\n\nThere’s a growing sense that **something is missing**—a sense of *aliveness,* or the intangible “why” behind our actions.\n\n### **A Hidden History of Disconnection**\nFrom the Roman Empire’s emphasis on domination to Europe’s drift into mechanistic worldviews post–Black Death, we inherited a **legacy of mistrust** in personal insight or moral intuition.  \n- **Descartes** severed mind from body.  \n- **Social Darwinism** suggested life is mere survival and competition.  \n- **Modern capitalism** runs on numeric metrics, fueling “funnels and tubes” (transactional, short-horizon approaches) rather than “spaces” for reflection and creativity.\n\n**Result:** Many of us became alienated from deeper ways of knowing—like the sense of meaning, beauty, and truth that historically guided craftsmanship, spiritual practice, and personal development.\n\n### **A Hidden Cause**\nBecause we can’t see the “source of meaning” in each other or ourselves, we reduce everything to **goals** (achieve, tick the box) and **preferences** (click, consume) or ephemeral **feelings** (maximize happiness). This fosters manipulation (advertising, power games) rather than genuine connection.\n\n### **The Real Work**\nReconnecting with the dimension of life that is inherently **meaningful** or **alive**—the intangible place where we do things for their own sake, linger, savor, and *become ourselves.* Our society’s short-term “instrumental” mind-set must give way to exploring the “sources of meaning” that endure. This is how we answer the call, *“Don’t ask what the world needs; ask what makes you come alive…”*\n\n---\n\n## **2. Don’t Ask What the World Needs…**  \n*(…Ask what makes you come alive, because the world needs people who have come alive.)*\n\nThis quote is often attributed to the theologian Howard Thurman. It resonates with **Joe Edelman’s** critique that **focusing on goals or preferences** misses our actual reason for living. A purely goal-driven life is *transactional*, always deferring real happiness or ignoring deeper longing. Meanwhile, aligning with what “makes you come alive” points to **sources of meaning**—not just fleeting wants.\n\n### **Instrumental vs. Constitutive Attention**\n- **Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs):** We do them to “get something done” or for an external payoff: “I must pass this test,” “I must behave this way to fit in,” etc. We typically want to *delegate* or *speed up* these tasks if we could—like errands or chores.  \n- **Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs):** These reflect the ways of living we cherish **intrinsically**. We want to dwell, savor, or expand them. They are the “come alive” dimension. Examples: “Listen deeply to my friend’s feelings,” “Follow my curiosity about how children learn,” “Savor the early morning autumn light.” We don’t want to accelerate these moments; we want to inhabit them fully.\n\n**Asking ‘what makes you come alive?’** is a question about your CAPs—how you attend to life in a way that is **meaningful for its own sake.**\n\n---\n\n## **3. Education, AI, and Our Collective Future**\n\n### **Education**  \n- **Current Model**: Often a factory process measuring “grades” (like meat or screws). Students ask, “When will I ever use this?” They’re forced into funnels: finish the lesson, pass the test, get the diploma.  \n- **Deeper Problem**: This entire approach addresses *instrumental** knowledge—short-horizon “What do I do to pass?”—rather than the “meaningful** knowledge” of discovering one’s calling or deeper reason to learn.  \n- **Don’t Decolonize Education—** or rather, don’t only talk about removing colonial narratives. We also need to **revitalize** the dimension of “spaces” in learning, where students explore open questions and find personal meaning (like the historical “madrasas” or vibrant “forums” of ancient philosophy).\n\n### **AI**  \n- Many “alignment” projects are basically about **aligning AI with operator intent** (goals) or with **preferences** (the user’s ephemeral likes). This is fragile and open to manipulation.  \n- **Joe Edelman’s** approach is to design “Wise AI” that recognizes and upholds human “sources of meaning.” Instead of funneling you to quick answers or superficial engagement, it becomes an **ally** that helps you identify your deeper values (CAPs) and create environments (“spaces”) that let you flourish.\n\nThis *Wise AI* aligns with the Sufi concept of a “guide” that counters illusions (Shaytan) or impulses (Hawa), reminding you of your deeper purpose.\n\n---\n\n## **4. The Four Enemies: A Meaning-Centric Take**\n\nFrom Sufi thought, the four enemies are **Nafs** (ego), **Shaytan** (scattered illusions), **Hawa** (cravings), and **Dunya** (attachments). Reframed in Joe’s lens, they’re ways we get locked into short-term or externally manipulated patterns, losing touch with our deeper source of meaning.\n\n1. **Nafs**: Overemphasis on personal status, pride, or recognition. Feeds **status-driven goals** (career vanity, social media envy).  \n2. **Shaytan**: Frenetic illusions or doubts. Amplifies **fear-based preferences** (envy, suspicion, outrage).  \n3. **Hawa**: Impulse-chasing or short-term feeling max. Fosters addiction loops, ephemeral pleasures overshadowing deeper joys.  \n4. **Dunya**: Material or external validation illusions. Ties self-worth to wealth, credentials, or superficial measures.\n\n**All four** can push us into the **“instrumental”** treadmill: constant busyness, funnel-based living, ignoring our real longing for meaning. The *antidote* is to cultivate “spaces” for reflection, presence, wonder, service, creativity—CAPs that we want to *linger in*, not escape.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Sources of Meaning, or “What Brings You to Life”**\n\n### **Attentional Policies & Values Cards**  \nJoe Edelman developed a method to help people clarify “sources of meaning.”  \n- We capture the **attentional policies** that define a meaningful way of living: “I notice X,” “I choose in ways that reflect Y.”  \n- **Constitutive** means we do it for its own sake.  \n- The process can reveal synergy across differences. When people share their “why” and “how” they attend to it, surprising common ground emerges—even across political lines.\n\n### **Emotions as Clues**\n- Negative emotions (anger, sadness, envy) often signal a **blocked source of meaning**.  \n- Positive emotions (joy, gratitude) signal a **fulfilled source of meaning**.  \n- By listening to them rather than shutting them down, we discover what we truly value.\n\n### **Spaces vs. Funnels**\n- **Funnels**: Achieve or push an outcome quickly. \"Get the certificate, scale up, do it faster.\"  \n- **Spaces**: No hurry to “get it done.” We explore, dwell, or connect. This is where we come alive.  \n- Reimagining education, workplaces, or AI recommender systems as *spaces* fosters personal meaning, not just more transactions.\n\n---\n\n## **6. A Possible Developmental Framework: Coming Alive Step-by-Step**\n\nHere’s a distilled approach you might use in workshops, 1:1 coaching, or personal journaling:\n\n1. **Check In with the “Now”**  \n   - Rate your energy (1–5).  \n   - Note your emotional tone or body sensations.  \n   - Ask: “What would make today feel complete or meaningful?”\n\n2. **Story Gathering**  \n   - **Tension Story**: “When have you wanted to do something meaningful, but found yourself blocked?”  \n   - **Aliveness Story**: “Tell me about a time you felt fully alive.”  \n   - **Support Story**: “When did help from others let you blossom?”\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**  \n   - Notice repeated conditions that block or enable meaning.  \n   - Watch for “enemy-based distortions”: Nafs (ego?), Hawa (impulse?), etc.  \n   - Identify the “CAPs” that define your deeper yearnings (e.g., “welcoming personal vulnerability in friendships,” “creative riffing with a buddy,” “deep inquiry into nature’s mysteries.”)\n\n4. **Integration & Next Steps**  \n   - Pick one small step to foster a “space” for that value (e.g., scheduling an unhurried creative jam).  \n   - Deliberately defuse “instrumental” self-talk: “I have to do this so I can prove X” and replace with: “I want to dwell in this because it’s what lights me up.”\n\n5. **Ongoing Reflection**  \n   - Notice negative feelings as they arise. Ask, “Which source of meaning is threatened or blocked?”  \n   - Gradually refine your attentional policies to align with your sense of life’s deeper richness.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Who Is This For?**\n\n- **Burnt-out impact ecosystem folks**: social entrepreneurs, nonprofit leaders, educators. They sense something is missing in the hustle.  \n- **Teachers and youth mentors**: wanting to transform the “funnel of schooling” into something more personal and alive.  \n- **Counselors, coaches, or facilitators**: searching for a unifying framework that addresses emotional health, moral/spiritual depth, and real-life choices.  \n- **Anyone seeking deeper aliveness** in a world that too often reduces them to a performance machine or consumer.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Why This Proves “Don’t Ask What the World Needs…”**\n\n### **Core Argument**\n1. **Instrumental logic**: “The world needs me to fix X, so I will do Y.” This leads to external motivations, fueling either hustle-and-burn or manipulative illusions.  \n2. **Constitutive logic**: “I do what brings me alive, because that’s where my deeper gifts reside.” This fosters genuine creativity, generosity, synergy with others, and an unforced sense of purpose.\n\nBecause we’re each uniquely “wired” to notice certain forms of beauty, goodness, or truth, we *naturally serve the world best* when we act from that place of *aliveness.* People in that state don’t exploit or manipulate; they create spaces for others to flourish, too.\n\n### **Holistic Benefits**\n- **Personal**: We’re not just checking items off a list; we’re becoming the presence we want to see in the world.  \n- **Interpersonal**: Others feel the authenticity. We form supportive, meaningful communities.  \n- **Societal**: When “wise AI” or reimagined education supports this level of meaning, entire systems shift from control-based models to networks of trust, curiosity, and synergy.\n\n---\n\n## **9. Conclusion: A Roadmap for Personal & Collective Renewal**\n\nIn sum, bridging the wisdom of Sufism’s “Four Enemies,” Joe Edelman’s “attention to meaning,” and our own longing to do something *real,* we find a **path**:\n\n1. **Acknowledge** the short-horizon illusions that keep us busy and unfulfilled.  \n2. **Name** the deeper sources of meaning that make us *come alive*.  \n3. **Restructure** our daily practices, relationships, and even AI tools to guard those spaces for meaning.  \n4. **Find synergy** with others on the same path—across divides—because “meaning” is less polarizing than “goals” or “preferences.”  \n5. **Enact** the simple intangible principle: *“Don’t ask what the world needs… ask what brings you alive. The rest follows.”*\n\n**This is how we restore life to education, sanity to AI, and authenticity to our own hearts.** By trusting we each have a unique sense of Goodness-Beauty-Truth, we build a world that no longer requires either colonial extraction or manipulative capitalism to operate. Instead, it’s powered by genuine human flourishing—**the unstoppable energy of people who have come alive.**",

      "content": "Below is a **unified narrative**—a single, cohesive story—that weaves together all the concepts we’ve explored: the Four Enemies from Sufi thought, Joe Edelman’s focus on sources of meaning over goals/preference, the pitfalls of modern education and AI, and how all this supports the mantra “Don’t ask what the world needs; ask what makes you come alive.”\n\n---\n\n## **A Single Story: The Seeker Who Rediscovers Meaning**\n\n### **Prologue: The Strain of Modern Life**\n\nImagine a teacher named Amina, halfway through the school year, feeling worn down and haunted by one question from her students: *“When will we ever use this?”* She notices the same hollow look in her colleagues, in the local nonprofit activists, and even in her tech-savvy friends. Everyone is busy meeting deadlines and chasing metrics, yet few seem *alive*.\n\nAmina wonders: “**What are we missing?** Why does it all feel so disconnected?” And as she rummages through old notes, poems, and half-baked manifestos, she stumbles on two lines scrawled in her college handwriting:\n\n> *“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what brings you alive—because the world needs people who have come alive.”*\n\nIt stirs something in her. She begins a quest to figure out why so many projects, from education to AI alignment, sidestep the most important question: *what truly makes us come alive?*\n\n---\n\n### **Act I: The Four Enemies in Action**\n\nIn her search for answers, Amina reconnects with an old friend, Bilal, who studied classical Sufi texts. He speaks of **Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, and Dunya**—the “enemies” that sabotage our deeper source of meaning.\n\n1. **Nafs** (Ego): Amina sees this in colleagues who brag about test scores or hunt for “Teacher of the Year.” They chase status goals, forgetting their original love of teaching. **Nafs** inflates the self, turning education into a competition.\n2. **Shaytan** (Scattering Whispers): In her students, Amina spots constant **doubt and envy**—some stressed about future success, some lost in social media illusions. This scattering leads to obsession with external measures of worth instead of deeper curiosity.\n3. **Hawa** (Cravings): She also sees how many are drawn to quick fixes— binge-watching, phone addiction—**impulsively** seeking hits of dopamine. They skip the slow satisfaction of reading, crafting, or reflecting.  \n4. **Dunya** (Material Attachment): She recognizes **Dunya** in the push for better credentials, bigger budgets, or chasing “the next big thing.” More money, more data, more performance metrics—rarely does it connect with the love of learning or community.\n\nObserving these “enemies” at play, Amina realizes they produce a culture of **goal-chasing and preference-satisfying**. Yet no one is asked about what they find truly meaningful. Everyone is “so busy,” but with tasks that feel *instrumental*, never *constitutive*.\n\n---\n\n### **Act II: Encounter with Joe Edelman’s Meaning-Centric Lens**\n\nAmina stumbles onto the work of **Joe Edelman**. He’s calling out a similar problem: society is fixated on **goals, preferences, or raw feeling-max**. But that’s incomplete. True *flourishing* means clarifying and supporting each person’s **“sources of meaning.”**\n\nEdelman’s method uses **Attentional Policies**:\n\n- **Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs)**: The “to-do tasks” you want done quickly or delegated if possible.  \n- **Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)**: The “ways of living” that matter for their own sake—moments you want to linger in and savor.  \n\nHe uses **Values Cards** to articulate a person’s CAPs in a bullet-list format, helping them see precisely what they want to pay attention to. If a teacher loves “Fostering Aha! Moments,” the relevant CAP might read:\n\n> **“Notice the small flickers of curiosity in a student’s eyes and ask open-ended questions that let them discover the solution at their own pace.”**\n\nThis is an example of a **constitutive** policy, because we don’t want to rush or skip it. We do it because it *brings us alive.*\n\nAmina sees the synergy between **Joe’s lens** and the **Sufi notion**: each “enemy” lures us away from these CAPs and traps us in ephemeral goals or illusions. \n\n---\n\n### **Act III: Education Re-Envisioned**\n\nAmina decides to pilot a small project:\n\n- She scraps the usual “test prep funnel” for a portion of class each week, turning it into an **open, creative space**. She calls it the “Meaningful Exploration Hour.”  \n- She helps students identify at least **one thing** they find intrinsically interesting. In a short reflective exercise, they articulate their personal “attention guidelines” for that interest (like creativity, collaboration, or tinkering with electronics).\n\nSurprisingly, *the students are engaged*. One says, “I realized I actually *love* analyzing old architecture. I just hated the tests.” Another starts an informal book club because she loves the quiet reflection on stories. They **linger**, not wanting to end the period. The “enemy” illusions lose some power:\n\n- **Nafs**: Less about proving themselves, more about sharing wonders.  \n- **Shaytan**: Fewer anxious comparisons, more mutual support.  \n- **Hawa**: Less impulse to “Zone out on my phone.” They’re exploring the mystery of their chosen topic.  \n- **Dunya**: They see learning can be for *its own sake,* not just to “get ahead.”\n\nAmina, too, feels *alive.* She recalls that old quote: “The world needs people who have come alive.” She glimpses how a small shift in **attentional focus** reorients the entire culture of her classroom.\n\n---\n\n### **Act IV: Implications for AI**\n\nMeanwhile, Bilal, who’s in the city’s “AI Ethics Lab,” wrestles with standard “alignment” proposals. Most revolve around operator goals (“Follow user’s instructions at all costs”) or preference-fulfillment (“Learn from the user’s clicks to keep them engaged”).\n\nHe sees the risk: if an AI only chases engagement, it might intensify illusions (Shaytan’s scattering), impulses (Hawa’s cravings), or vanity metrics (Nafs). Joe Edelman’s approach suggests a **Wise AI** that, rather than funnel you to impulsive goals or fleeting preferences, helps you articulate **sources of meaning**. For instance:\n\n- **When you chat about your anxiety** at 2 a.m., a wise AI can gently ask: “Is there a deeper longing beneath this fear?”  \n- **When you claim you want to see the next viral clickbait**, a wise AI might pause: “Would chasing more sensational content conflict with your deeper desire to cultivate calm or insight?”\n\nIn a way, **AI could become a “teacher”** that fosters the same “Meaningful Exploration Hour” approach:\n\n1. **Identify** if you’re stuck in short-horizon fear or impulse.  \n2. **Remind** you of your real “CAPs” or ways you want to show up.  \n3. **Suggest** small micro-steps or “spaces” that feed that sense of meaning.\n\nThis synergy of **education** and **Wise AI** is the real future: not more funnels or “token-based success,” but an alignment with what truly makes each person come alive.\n\n---\n\n### **Act V: The Moral of the Story**\n\nAs the school year continues, Amina sees her pilot flourish. She’s not only teaching “subjects,” she’s also guiding students to see their own capacity for curiosity, collaboration, artistry. She keeps a personal journal, noting how she overcame her own illusions:\n\n- **Nafs**: She stops measuring her success by how many “competitions” her students win.  \n- **Shaytan**: She no longer fears parents’ judgment or random negative feedback, trusting the deeper logic of meaning.  \n- **Hawa**: She resists quick fix solutions—like awarding flashy extra credit—when students lose focus. Instead, she returns them to the question: “What do *you* find intriguing or puzzling about this topic?”  \n- **Dunya**: She’s less concerned with big pay raises or external approval, focusing on the joy of truly teaching.\n\nIt’s not utopia, but the shift is tangible. Burnout recedes. Students feel recognized as **humans** with unique “sources of meaning,” not cogs measured by standardized tests.\n\nShe imagines a bigger change: if nonprofits let staff cultivate meaning so they wouldn’t burn out in pursuit of external “impact goals.” If social entrepreneurs slowed down to deeply sense whether their service truly aligned with deeper personal convictions. If AI systems pivoted from “preferences” to “meaning.” The entire landscape would transform from a rat race to a flourishing orchard.\n\n---\n\n## **Epilogue: Becoming Fully Alive**\n\nIn the final staff meeting, Amina quotes the line that started her quest:\n\n> “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive—because the world needs people who have come alive.”\n\nShe explains how it once felt naive. *Surely we have to fix the real problems in the world.* But now, she sees how superficial “problem-solving” can trap us in illusions. Only by **honoring** each person’s deeper, constitutive dimension of living do we begin to **truly** solve anything. Because, paradoxically, the more we come alive, the more naturally we serve others—and *that* is precisely what the world needs.\n\n---\n\n### **In Short**\n\nThis is the story of a single teacher who glimpses the root issue that plagues modern education, AI, and hustle culture: we’ve lost contact with our *sources of meaning*. By understanding the Sufi-lens “enemies,” adopting Joe Edelman’s shift from *instrumental* to *constitutive* living, and championing the line “ask what makes you come alive,” we see a new blueprint for personal development, societal transformation, and even AI design.\n\n**That** is the unified story. It draws on everything we’ve discussed—**the historical drift away from meaning, the infiltration of the Four Enemies in everyday life, Joe Edelman’s attentional approach,** and the clarion call to do what enlivens us, for the sake of ourselves *and* the world.",

      "content": "Below is a **cohesive document** that presents our **meaning-centric framework**—tying together the Four Enemies (Sufi lens), Joe Edelman’s ideas on instrumental vs. constitutive attentional policies (IAPs vs. CAPs), and practical considerations about balancing “aliveness” with structure, readiness for introspection, and how society might integrate CAP-based living. Along the way, I’ll reframe and answer your final questions within the structure.\n\n---\n\n# **MEANING-CENTRIC FRAMEWORK: Integrating Four Enemies, Attentional Policies, and Real-Life Constraints**\n\n## **1. Introduction & Motivation**\n\nModern life often pushes us into constant “doing” at the expense of “being,” measuring success by external metrics—grades, job titles, social approval—without nurturing a deeper sense of *aliveness* or *meaning.* This document proposes a **meaning-centric framework** that weaves together:\n\n- **Four Enemies** from Sufi thought (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya).  \n- **Attentional Policies** from Joe Edelman’s approach (IAPs vs. CAPs).  \n- **Practical real-world questions** about how much “aliveness” is feasible, how to handle routine-lovers, readiness for introspection, and whether society can function if everyone tries to maximize “spaces” over “funnels.”\n\nThe core premise is that humans flourish not by chasing short-horizon tasks (instrumental goals) but by spending significant time in ways they find **intrinsically meaningful**—“coming alive.” Yet, we need a nuanced view that **respects diversity**, avoids imposing a single definition of “aliveness,” and integrates with society’s pragmatic needs.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Key Concepts & Definitions**\n\n### **2.1 Four Enemies & Their Distortions**\n\nThe Sufi tradition identifies four “enemies” that distract us from a more holistic or divine sense of meaning:\n\n| **Enemy** | **Primary Distortion** | **Description** | **Typical Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs)** |\n|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Nafs (Ego)** | **Self-importance** (Pushing attention onto personal status, entitlement) | The inflated sense of “I must be seen as superior,” fueling pride, competitiveness, or defensiveness. | - “I must always be right.”<br>- “I must win arguments.”<br>- “People should respect me.” |\n| **Shaytan (Satanic Whispering)** | **Scattering** (Doubts, illusions, envy, paranoia) | Floods the mind with illusions, negative comparisons, or conspiracies. | - “I must check if others are doing better.”<br>- “I suspect hidden threats everywhere.”<br>- “I must keep them from surpassing me.” |\n| **Hawa (Base Desires)** | **Pulling** (Impulsive cravings, emotional reactivity) | Locks attention on immediate gratification (food, sex, addictive media). | - “If it feels good, do it now.”<br>- “I deserve this indulgence.”<br>- “I can’t handle discomfort.” |\n| **Dunya (Worldly Attachment)** | **Binding** (Materialism, status symbols) | Binds attention to external measures, consumption, and social approval. | - “I need more money to feel safe.”<br>- “What others think of me defines me.”<br>- “Appear successful at any cost.” |\n\nEach “enemy” fosters short-horizon or externally manipulated **IAPs** that overshadow deeper “coming alive.”\n\n### **2.2 Attentional Policies: IAPs vs. CAPs**\n\n**Attentional policies** define **what we attend to** when making a choice:\n\n- **IAP (Instrumental Attentional Policy)**:  \n  - You do it to get a result—often wanting to finish it quickly or delegate if possible.  \n  - Example: “Study only to pass the test,” “Reply to emails just to keep the inbox clear.”  \n  - Usually triggered by fear, pressure, or external reward (linking to the Four Enemies).\n\n- **CAP (Constitutive Attentional Policy)**:  \n  - You do it for its own sake, wanting to linger or savor it.  \n  - Example: “Notice the subtle color changes in the sunset each evening,” “Explore a child’s curiosity in conversation because it warms my heart.”  \n  - Reflects your personal sense of meaning or “aliveness.” Ties to **virtues** or **values** you want to embody.\n\n### **2.3 CAPs, Virtues, & “Coming Alive”**\n\nA CAP often points to a **virtue** or **quality of living** that you cherish intrinsically:\n\n| **Enemy**  | **Distorted IAP** (Short-Horizon)        | **CAP Example** (Aligned Virtue)                | **Related Virtue**         |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Nafs**   | “I must show I’m superior.”              | “I humbly welcome feedback to learn.”           | **Humility**               |\n| **Shaytan**| “I compare myself to everyone endlessly.”| “I focus on celebrating others’ success and my own path.” | **Generosity of spirit** |\n| **Hawa**   | “Any boredom must be instantly fixed.”    | “I linger in the process, tolerating discomfort to find depth.” | **Patience**          |\n| **Dunya**  | “I measure worth by possessions, status.”| “I measure success by how I live my values daily.”| **Authenticity**          |\n\n---\n\n## **3. The Framework in Practice: Tables & Alignment**\n\n### **3.1 Mapping Enemies to IAPs, CAPs, and Virtues**\n\nBelow is a **detailed table** tying together the Four Enemies, sample IAP clusters, possible CAP transformations, and associated virtues or qualities:\n\n| **Enemy** | **Common IAPs** | **Underlying Fear/Drive** | **Potential CAP** | **Related Virtues** |\n|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Nafs** (Ego) | - “I must defend my status.” <br>- “I need credit for successes.” <br>- “I can’t show weakness.” | Fear of losing self-image; Desire for validation | - “Attend to opportunities to learn from criticism.” <br>- “Notice when I’m defensive—ask if there’s truth in it.” | Humility, Open-mindedness, Willingness to Grow |\n| **Shaytan** (Scattered illusions) | - “Compare, envy, suspect ill intent.” <br>- “Constantly watch out for betrayal.” <br>- “Everyone’s out to get me.” | Distrust of self & others; Anxiety about status & truth | - “Attend to gratitude for what I have.” <br>- “Focus on small daily joys or blessings to ground myself.” | Trust, Gratitude, Charity of Interpretation |\n| **Hawa** (Impulses) | - “If it’s unpleasant, avoid it.” <br>- “If it’s pleasurable, do it now!” <br>- “I can’t handle boredom.” | Fear of discomfort; Desire to maximize immediate pleasure | - “Observe cravings before acting—feel them fully.” <br>- “Find satisfaction in small, mindful indulgences.” | Temperance, Self-Discipline, Presence |\n| **Dunya** (Material) | - “Money and looks define me.” <br>- “More is better; keep accumulating.” <br>- “I must be recognized externally.” | Scarcity mindset; Social identity fear | - “Attend to deeper joys unlinked to wealth or fame.” <br>- “Share resources to create community.” | Generosity, Equanimity, Authenticity |\n\n**Note**: This table is not about demonizing goals or ignoring practicality. It’s about distinguishing between short-horizon, fear-based or pride-based IAPs and the potential **CAPs** that align with deeper living.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Reframing Key Questions & Their Answers**\n\nBelow are your questions, reformulated, followed by direct responses.\n\n### **Q1: “Does ‘coming alive’ make sense as a goal? Some people prefer structure or routine—are we imposing a single notion of goodness on them?”**\n\n**Reframe:** *Is “coming alive” in tension with routine or structure? Do we risk universalizing one style of aliveness?*\n\n**Answer:**\n- **“Coming alive”** isn’t necessarily about spontaneity or anti-structure. For many, a **stable routine** *is* part of what fosters meaning. Example: “I find **aliveness** in a well-established daily ritual of writing or cooking; it provides a calm, nourishing space for creativity or reflection.”  \n- The key is whether the routine is **purely instrumental** (“I just do it to survive or impress others”) or **constitutive** (“I do it because it resonates with me at a deeper level”).  \n- We aren’t imposing a single definition of “aliveness.” The framework is about discovering each person’s **CAP**—whether that’s vibrant novelty or quiet consistency. Both can be deeply meaningful if done for intrinsic reasons.\n\n### **Q2: “Are people ready for deep introspection? Or should we approach them through arts, nature, or simpler reflection first?”**\n\n**Reframe:** *If someone is “lost” or not introspective, how do we invite them into meaning-based reflection?*\n\n**Answer:**\n- **Readiness** for introspection varies. Some are “introspection-weary” or just not used to it.  \n- **Arts, nature immersion, body movement** can serve as gentler gateways to encounter meaning without diving into formal self-questionnaires.  \n- The **CAP approach** can unfold gradually:  \n  1. Expose them to experiences that evoke wonder or calm (e.g., a walk in the woods, group art jam).  \n  2. Invite them to notice what parts of the experience they’d want to linger in.  \n  3. Slowly help them articulate that attention as a “policy.”  \n- In other words, **experiential, sensory channels** can prime an individual to see what resonates, building a foundation for deeper self-awareness.\n\n### **Q3: “Is a healthy society possible if everyone pursued ‘spaces’ (CAP time) and minimized funnels (IAP tasks)? Or is that unrealistic?”**\n\n**Reframe:** *Do we need funnels/tubes for societal functioning? Can we drastically reduce them?*\n\n**Answer:**\n- A society likely **can’t eliminate** all short-horizon tasks. We do need some “infrastructure” to produce goods, handle tasks quickly, etc.  \n- We aim for a **balance**:  \n  - Enough “space” to let each person flourish in ways that matter to them.  \n  - Enough “funnels/tubes” for necessary coordination.  \n- At scale, we can adopt strategies like:  \n  - **Design funnels** that are *in service* of more meaningful spaces (e.g., a “grocery tube” that quickly helps you get fresh produce so you can spend more time cooking joyfully, not in a stress-laden checkout line).  \n  - **Redistribute** how much time we invest in purely instrumental tasks vs. free “space” for CAPs. Possibly we don’t need to crush them to zero, but we can keep them minimal or delegated to machines if they truly do not feed our sense of meaning.\n\n### **Q4: “What percentage of life should be CAP vs. IAP? Could we turn everything into a CAP? Is that an ultimate goal, or do we need an alternative framing?”**\n\n**Reframe:** *Should we attempt to convert all tasks into “aliveness,” or do we accept some tasks remain purely instrumental?*\n\n**Answer:**\n- **Some tasks** might remain purely instrumental—and that’s okay. *Complete* elimination of IAP is neither possible nor necessary.  \n- Instead of forcing every single activity into a CAP, we look for **opportunities** to reduce meaningless drudgery or find an aspect of meaning in them. For instance, cleaning the house can be a mindful, aesthetic ritual (a CAP) if that resonates. But for some, it’s purely a chore (an IAP).  \n- The central idea is to **remain aware**:  \n  - If an activity is a persistent IAP that we resent, can we **delegate** it, find a new approach that brings meaning, or question whether it’s truly needed at all?  \n  - If not, maybe it’s a small price for supporting the broader environment that fosters CAPs.  \n- So, the aim is not to make 100% of activities “intrinsically meaningful,” but to **increase** the portion where we genuinely come alive, thus improving overall well-being.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Putting It All Together: A Cohesive Document Structure**\n\nBelow is a **summary outline** to see how it all fits:\n\n1. **Introduction & Motivation**  \n   - The modern sense of burnout & emptiness  \n   - Why “meaning” vs. “goals/preferences” matters  \n2. **Key Concepts**  \n   - Four Enemies (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya) as short-horizon distortions  \n   - IAPs (Instrumental) vs. CAPs (Constitutive)  \n   - CAPs’ alignment with deeper virtues or “coming alive”  \n3. **Tables of Alignment**  \n   - Detailed table linking each enemy to typical IAPs, underlying fears, possible CAP transformations, and virtues  \n4. **FAQ & Reframed Questions**  \n   1. *Does “aliveness” overshadow routine-lovers?* → No, routine can be a valid CAP if intrinsically cherished.  \n   2. *Are people ready for introspection?* → Some need gentler, experiential gateways. Arts or nature-based approaches.  \n   3. *Is a society of “spaces” feasible?* → We need balance. Some funnels/tubes remain essential, but we can reduce or reshape them to serve real meaning.  \n   4. *Should everything become CAP?* → Not everything, but increasing CAP proportion fosters well-being. Some tasks stay instrumental or can be automated.  \n5. **Application Cases**  \n   - Education: Using CAP-based reflection to spark real student engagement, while acknowledging standardized tasks.  \n   - AI Tools: Building “Wise AI” that encourages clarifying personal meaning (CAP) instead of short-horizon user engagement.  \n   - Personal Practice: Strategies to identify IAP burdens and experiment with small CAP expansions.  \n6. **Conclusion & Future Directions**  \n   - The ultimate aim: Not to remove all structure, but to let more of life’s structure reflect *intrinsic meaning.*  \n   - Realizing that “coming alive” is flexible—some find it in quiet routine, others in adventure, but each fosters authenticity.  \n   - Society prospers when we collectively reduce forced funnels, allowing a greater share of life devoted to being fully *who we are,* which ironically benefits everyone’s mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Final Words**\n\n**Coming alive** is not a rigid formula. It’s a pointer toward living in ways that feel meaningful in themselves, not just an **endless chain of “musts.”** Some people do find deep fulfillment in stable routines; that is entirely valid if **intrinsically** guided. We can open “arts, nature, or gentle experiences” as portals to meaning for those unready for raw introspection. And yes, in real life, we’ll keep some funnels around. The question is **how much** do we want short-horizon tasks and external pressures to dominate?\n\nThis framework’s essence:  \n1. **Identify** instrumental vs. constitutive attention.  \n2. **Recognize** how the Four Enemies fuel the short horizon.  \n3. **Shift** or carve out more “space” for the CAP-based ways of living.  \n4. **Accept** that it’s a balance, not an all-or-nothing utopia. Even incremental expansions of “aliveness” can transform individuals, communities, and eventually the systems we inhabit.",

      "content": "Below is an **updated framework** that incorporates a more **Ian McGilchrist–inspired “two-hemispheres”** perspective, a new term for “aliveness” that doesn’t connote high-energy states, and a refined understanding of how our time and attention might balance between the “left-hemisphere” (analytical, narrowly focused) and “right-hemisphere” (contextual, open to meaning). We also keep the lens of the **Four Enemies** and **Attentional Policies** intact but give them a hemisphere-based nuance.\n\n---\n\n# **UPDATED MEANING-CENTRIC FRAMEWORK: “Vital Presence,” Two Hemispheres, & the Four Enemies**\n\n## **1. Why a New Term for “Aliveness”?**\n\n**“Aliveness”** can imply high-voltage energy, zeal, or extroversion. But not everyone experiences “deep meaning” as outward vigor. Some find it quietly in solitude, reflection, or routine. Therefore, we propose **“Vital Presence”** (or “Resonant Being”) as an alternative term:\n\n- **Vital Presence** conveys a **fullness of engagement** with life, yet it needn’t be showy or energetic. It can manifest in calm, contemplative states or structured routines that feel richly meaningful.  \n- It emphasizes **attunement** to context, relationship, or creative flow—any situation where we’re not “just ticking boxes,” but personally dwelling in what matters to us.\n\nThis shift helps validate **lower-energy or introverted ways** of experiencing profound connection and meaning. “Coming alive” thus becomes “entering vital presence,” letting people set aside the connotation of “loud enthusiasm” and see it as **deep interior resonance**.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Ian McGilchrist’s Two-Hemisphere Lens**\n\n### **2.1 Quick Recap: Left vs. Right Hemisphere**\n\nAccording to Ian McGilchrist’s work, each hemisphere of the brain has distinct modes of attending to the world:\n\n- **Left Hemisphere**  \n  - Narrow, focused attention  \n  - Analyzes, labels, and dissects  \n  - Prefers certainty, structure, goals  \n  - Useful for short-horizon tasks, manipulations, or clarifications  \n- **Right Hemisphere**  \n  - Broad, open attention  \n  - Contextual, relational, “living in the bigger picture”  \n  - Embraces novelty, ambiguity, emotion, empathy  \n  - Linked to **meaning-making**, creativity, presence\n\nMcGilchrist emphasizes that a balanced mind integrates **both** hemispheres in synergy. However, modern culture often succumbs to a **“left-hemisphere tyranny,”** prioritizing measurables, control, and short-term achievements at the expense of contextual depth and meaning.\n\n### **2.2 Sources of Meaning & The Hemispheres**\n\n- **Left Hemisphere** can fragment experiences into tasks, goals, or preferences, losing sight of the broader significance. It sees a **funnel** to accomplish or a **tube** to get from A to B.  \n- **Right Hemisphere** perceives the **“whole”**—the intangible sense of connection, possibility, or “vital presence.” It sees a **space** for exploration, reflection, and creativity.  \n\n**Sources of meaning** (or the things that bring us “vital presence”) rely heavily on **right-hemisphere** capacities, such as open awareness, metaphor, emotional resonance, and holistic connections. Still, the left hemisphere can help us organize these insights into real-world actions or structures.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Revisiting the Four Enemies & Attentional Policies with McGilchrist’s Approach**\n\n### **3.1 Four Enemies: Left-Hemisphere Overreach or Distortions?**\n\nThe **Four Enemies (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya)** can be seen as ways we get **unbalanced** toward left-hemisphere dominance (control, goals, illusions) or short-term reactivity. They overshadow the **right-hemisphere**’s capacity for contextual meaning:\n\n1. **Nafs (Ego):**  \n   - Left-hemisphere overfocus on self-importance, labeling “I vs. others.”  \n   - Missing right-hemisphere humility, relational or communal sense.  \n   - Distorted Attentional Policy: “I must prove I’m superior,” ignoring broader empathic context.\n\n2. **Shaytan (Scattering Doubts):**  \n   - Anxiety-driven vigilance, suspicious or conspiratorial thinking, lacking right-hemisphere trust or empathy.  \n   - Distorted Attentional Policy: “Obsess over threats,” ignoring nuance or gratitude.\n\n3. **Hawa (Impulses):**  \n   - Overly reactive or reward-driven short focus, left-hemisphere chasing immediate outcomes.  \n   - Missing right-hemisphere’s patient dwelling in deeper satisfaction or presence.\n\n4. **Dunya (Material Attachments):**  \n   - Ties identity to external labels, metrics, left-hemisphere’s partial view.  \n   - Distorted Attentional Policy: “Status is everything,” ignoring intangible meaning.\n\n### **3.2 Instrumental vs. Constitutive Policies in a Two-Hemisphere Frame**\n\n- **Instrumental Attentional Policies (IAPs)** reflect **left-hemisphere** strengths: achieving specific, discrete tasks, often quickly or forcibly. E.g., “Just get the grade,” “Close the deal.”  \n- **Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)** rely more on **right-hemisphere** capacities: relational, open-ended, context-rich. E.g., “Linger in a child’s curiosity,” “Savor daily chores as meditative.”\n\nA balanced mind uses the **left hemisphere** to support and structure the **right hemisphere**’s sense of meaning, not overrule it.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Application: Balancing Our Time & Attention Across Hemispheres**\n\n### **4.1 Percentage or Proportion of CAP vs. IAP?**\n\n**Question**: “Can society run if everyone focuses on spaces (CAP/right hemisphere)? Don’t we need funnels and tasks?”\n\n**Answer**:\n- We **do** need tasks (left-hemisphere–aligned) for daily logistics: paying bills, manufacturing goods, fulfilling obligations.  \n- The goal is not to eradicate them but to keep them in **service** of broader meaning. In McGilchrist’s terms, let the right hemisphere “lead,” with the left hemisphere “contributing” specialized detail.  \n- Practically, this might translate to a **higher ratio** of CAP-based living (relational meaning, reflection, creativity) than we commonly see. Instead of, say, 80% IAP-driven funnel-living, we might aim for a more balanced 50/50 or even 70/30 in favor of CAP or “vital presence.”\n\n### **4.2 For People Who Thrive on Routine & Structure**\n\n**Question**: “Some people aren’t into artsy spontaneity—they love routine or predictable rhythms. Isn’t that more left-hemisphere? Are they missing out on ‘vital presence’?”\n\n**Answer**:\n- Routines can be deeply **right-hemisphere** if approached with **attentive presence** and **felt meaning** rather than rote repetition.  \n- For example, a daily walk at sunrise can become a meditative CAP: noticing the changing light, the subtle temperature shifts—an integrated right-hemisphere practice.  \n- The difference is *not* the presence of routine but whether one experiences it as purely instrumental (“Must finish this so I can get on with my day”) vs. **intrinsically resonant** (“This routine nurtures me deeply”).\n\n### **4.3 Readiness for Introspection vs. Arts/Nature Approaches**\n\n**Question**: “If someone’s not introspective, do we force them to self-reflect? Or do we find an indirect path?”\n\n**Answer**:\n- **Right-hemisphere** connection can develop through **arts, nature, or guided group experiences** without explicit psychoanalysis.  \n- Over time, these immersive experiences can open the door for gentle reflection, noticing which aspects of the experience felt deeply “right” or “nourishing.”  \n- This approach fosters an *embodied*, lived sense of meaning, bridging them into more direct introspection if/when they’re ready.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Toward a “Vital Presence” Society: Personal, Social, & Ecological Survival\n\n### **5.1 Personal Survival & Flourishing**\n- By balancing hemispheres, we reclaim the capacity to see the **whole** and not burn out in goal-obsession.  \n- We can integrate Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, and Dunya *in healthy ways,* e.g., letting the impetus to achieve or consume (left hemisphere) be tempered by a right-hemisphere sense of proportion and empathy.\n\n### **5.2 Social & Ecological Benefits**\n- **Right-hemisphere–inspired** approaches lead to more **cooperative, relational** interactions (less fortress-like competition).  \n- People with **Vital Presence** tend to care about **ecological context**, relationships, and intangible communal goods.  \n- Education, nonprofits, or AI systems that *prioritize meaning* can restructure funnels/tubes so they serve deeper relationships, sustainability, and well-being.\n\n### **5.3 Can We Make Everything a CAP?**\n- Probably not all tasks become CAPs. Some remain purely instrumental. But we can **transform** or **outsource** many low-meaning tasks or re-imbue them with care.  \n- The realistic approach is to **significantly increase** the portion of time devoted to “vital presence” or “CAP living” while acknowledging certain chores or logistics remain. Over time, technology and social arrangements might minimize burden, freeing more space for meaningful living.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Summary of the Updated Framework**\n\n1. **From “Aliveness” to “Vital Presence”:**  \n   - Encourages a broader notion of living meaningfully (not always high-energy).\n\n2. **Ian McGilchrist’s Hemispheres:**  \n   - Left Hemisphere → focus on detail, goals, extraction, manipulation.  \n   - Right Hemisphere → context, holistic meaning, empathy, creativity.\n\n3. **Four Enemies & Hemispheres:**  \n   - The enemies represent ways the **left hemisphere** can overshadow the **right** (or short-term impulses overshadow deeper awareness).\n\n4. **IAPs (Instrumental) vs. CAPs (Constitutive):**  \n   - IAPs: short horizon, externally driven, often left-hemisphere.  \n   - CAPs: deeper resonance, open-ended presence, synergy with right hemisphere.\n\n5. **Balancing Attention:**  \n   - Society cannot purely run on “spaces”; we need some tasks/funnels.  \n   - The aim is to *rebalance*, letting the right hemisphere’s sense of meaning lead, with left hemisphere providing structure as needed.\n\n6. **Implementing in Real Life:**  \n   - People not ready for direct introspection may find the right hemisphere through **arts, nature, slow routine**.  \n   - Routine-lovers can find “Vital Presence” in stable habits if they’re experienced with mindful, meaningful attention.  \n   - The overarching principle is to **reinstate the right hemisphere** as a guiding perspective to ensure a sense of wholeness, ecological care, and personal fulfillment.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Concluding Note: What Matters is the Balance**\n\nThe integrated two-hemisphere approach reminds us that neither we nor society can or should eliminate tasks, structure, or routine. But a **dominant left-hemisphere** mode—fixated on controlling metrics or short-term goals—undermines the sense of wholeness, love, creativity, and yes, *Vital Presence* we crave. By acknowledging the role of the Four Enemies as misalignments toward fear-based or pride-based left-hemisphere patterns, and cultivating **constitutive attentional policies** that restore the **right hemisphere**'s relational, holistic perspective, we find a more **integrated** path.\n\nThis is how we move from simple “aliveness” to a sustained **Vital Presence**—one that **embraces structure** where it helps, **opens** to curiosity, **manages** routine chores gracefully, and nurtures both personal and ecological well-being. Each person’s ratio of CAP to IAP, or “spaces” to “funnels,” will differ, but in each case, the synergy of the two hemispheres can bring about a deeper, balanced meaning in everyday life.",

And I want to find another word. I don't like this vital resonance. It's kind of awkward. Come alive is really clear and fun, but let's even come up with another couple of ways, a few ways of saying this. And let's redo this, and be sure to use the right format structure for the attentional policies, starting with a noun phrase and a descriptive sentence after it. And then let's think of the enemies, and then let's think of the foundational virtues. I'm noticing in so many traditions, it's like this also, there's like this pull towards through love, and the push away with fear, and that where there is love, there can be no power. There's just submission, and peace, and mercy. And when there is power, there can be no love. And this whole idea of wanting control, and that, you know, acknowledgement of the humility that we don't control, and how this opens up the space for real life in relationship, rather than the self-protective, individualistic organism. And I'd be curious if we could also have a brief history of the ideas that led to this individualist, materialist worldview, and the evidence for the fact that we can access these immaterial, broader states from Ian's and others' research.",

      "content": "Below is an **updated, integrated document** that brings together:\n\n- **Broaden and Build** (Barbara Fredrickson)  \n- **Flow** (Mihály Csikszentmihályi)  \n- **Nietzsche**’s “He who has a strong enough why can bear almost any how”  \n- The **“Thoughts → Actions → Habits → Character → Destiny”** principle  \n- The **quote** often attributed to **Howard Thurman**: “Don’t ask what the world needs … people who have come alive.”  \n- New alternative words for “come alive”  \n- **Attentional Policies** in the correct format (noun phrase + descriptive phrase)  \n- **Four Enemies** (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya) and **Foundational Virtues**  \n- Tension between **love vs. power**, the humility needed for real relationships  \n- Brief **historical context** of individualist, materialist worldview  \n- **Evidence** from Ian McGilchrist (and others) that we can access broader, “immaterial” states\n\n---\n\n# **HOLISTIC MEANING FRAMEWORK**  \n*(A Multi-Tradition Synthesis)*\n\n## **1. Introduction & Rationale**\n\nModern individuals often sense a **gap** between:\n\n1. **Chasing goals** or forcibly managing life (power)  \n2. **Experiencing love, humility, and wonder** that fosters deep connection\n\nWe see how **Barbara Fredrickson’s** *Broaden and Build* theory suggests positive emotions—like love, joy, interest—increase cognitive openness, resilience, and social bonds. Meanwhile, **Csikszentmihályi’s** *Flow* reveals how being fully immersed in a meaningful challenge yields joy, creativity, and timeless absorption. **Nietzsche** reminds us that **a powerful “why”** can sustain us through any adversity. And the old **Thurman** quote urges us to **do** what brings us “alive” (or any of the synonyms we’ll propose) because that’s what truly benefits the world.\n\nYet, we wrestle with the **Four Enemies** (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya) that push us into short-horizon tasks, illusions, or craving. And historically, a **materialist, individualistic worldview** emerged from thinkers like Descartes (“I think, therefore I am”), Hobbes (“life is nasty, brutish, short”), and a post-Enlightenment emphasis on controlling the environment. This overshadowed intangible dimensions like **love, awe, or spiritual depth**. However, **Ian McGilchrist’s** research on the brain’s hemispheres, plus cross-cultural evidence, shows we can access broader, “immaterial” states—like empathy, intuition, or holistic understanding—that flourish when we allow for humility, relational awareness, and trust.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Alternative Words for “Come Alive”**\n\n1. **Deeply Awake**  \n2. **Fully Engaged**  \n3. **Lively Resonance**  \n4. **Living from the Heart**  \n5. **Embodied Vigor**  \n\nAll these aim to capture that sense of **intrinsic, meaningful presence** (not necessarily high-energy extroversion).\n\n---\n\n## **3. Four Enemies, Foundational Virtues, & Attentional Policies**\n\n**Four Enemies**:  \n1. **Nafs**: Inflates ego and status focus.  \n2. **Shaytan**: Scatters attention with envy, paranoia, illusions.  \n3. **Hawa**: Pulls us into impulsive cravings, emotional reactivity.  \n4. **Dunya**: Binds us to material success, external validation.\n\nEach has “Instrumental Attentional Policies” (IAPs)—short horizon, fear/power-based—and can be countered by “Constitutive Attentional Policies” (CAPs)—long-horizon, love/humility-based. Let’s look at them side by side with **Foundational Virtues**:\n\n### **3.1 Nafs (Ego)**\n\n| **IAP (Instrumental)**                                 | **Underlying Fear**                                    | **CAP (Constitutive)**                                                         | **Foundational Virtue**   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **MOMENTS of status comparison** that I use to prove my worth. | Fear of being “less,” craving control or admiration.    | **MOMENTS of honest self-reflection** that invite humility and growth.          | **Humility**              |\n| **CHOICES to dominate** conversations so I appear correct. | Fear of looking weak, losing “power.”                  | **CHOICES to actively seek** others’ perspectives and celebrate mutual learning. | **Open-mindedness**       |\n\n### **3.2 Shaytan (Scattered Doubts)**\n\n| **IAP (Instrumental)**                                                | **Underlying Fear**                         | **CAP (Constitutive)**                                                              | **Foundational Virtue** |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **THOUGHTS that fixate** on others’ successes, fueling envy.          | Fear of being outdone, illusions of threat. | **THOUGHTS that celebrate** others’ achievements, cultivating gratitude for my path. | **Gratitude**           |\n| **MOMENTS of suspicion** where I assume ill intent in ambiguous acts. | Fear of betrayal, distrust of connection.   | **MOMENTS of empathy** where I imagine positive motives and look for mutual benefit. | **Charity of Interpretation** |\n\n### **3.3 Hawa (Impulses)**\n\n| **IAP (Instrumental)**                                               | **Underlying Fear**                        | **CAP (Constitutive)**                                                              | **Foundational Virtue** |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **CHOICES to avoid** any discomfort by seeking quick pleasure.       | Fear of pain, inability to tolerate boredom | **CHOICES to remain present** with mild discomfort, exploring deeper fulfillment.    | **Patience**            |\n| **MOMENTS of craving** that hijack my schedule or relationships.     | Fear that real needs won’t be met.         | **MOMENTS of mindful awareness** of craving, letting it pass or guiding it wisely.   | **Self-Control**        |\n\n### **3.4 Dunya (Material Attachments)**\n\n| **IAP (Instrumental)**                                                         | **Underlying Fear**               | **CAP (Constitutive)**                                                              | **Foundational Virtue** |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **THOUGHTS that rank** people by income, status, or possessions.               | Fear of “not having enough.”       | **THOUGHTS that re-center** on intrinsic worth, generosity, and shared well-being.   | **Generosity**          |\n| **MOMENTS of vanity** where I measure success purely by external validation.    | Fear of invisibility or irrelevance | **MOMENTS of grounding** in relationships, service, or creativity for its own sake.  | **Authenticity**        |\n\n---\n\n## **4. Broaden and Build, Flow, & the “Why” That Guides the “How”**\n\n### **4.1 Fredrickson’s Broaden and Build**\n\nPositive emotions like **joy, love, curiosity** **broaden** our mental scope, enabling creativity and problem-solving. Over time, they **build** lasting resources—resilience, relationships, skills. This synergy matches **CAP** living: we linger in “spaces” (love, curiosity) that expand possibility.\n\n### **4.2 Csikszentmihályi’s Flow**\n\nFlow occurs when **challenge** matches **skill**, accompanied by **clear goals**, immediate feedback, and a sense of merging with the activity. This echoes the **Constitutive Policy** approach: we fully attend to what feels meaningful, losing track of time in a positive sense.\n\n### **4.3 Nietzsche’s Strong “Why” Overcoming “How”\n\nIf we have a **clear “why”**—like love for teaching or a commitment to serve—that sense of meaning can anchor us through adversity. This resonates with “Don’t ask what the world needs—ask what you feel called to do.” That deeper “why” fuels tenacity, as we see in *Broaden and Build* (positive emotions sustaining us) or *Flow* (immersed in purposeful challenge).\n\n### **4.4 Thoughts → Actions → Habits → Character → Destiny**\n\nWhen we repeatedly align our daily **attentional policies** (thought-level) with these CAP-based virtues, we form **habits** of humility, gratitude, patience, authenticity. Over time, these shape **character** and eventually one’s destiny—an ever-growing capacity for **love** over **power**, relational presence over domination.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Love vs. Power: Humility and Relational Openness**\n\n**Where there is love, there is no need for exerted power** or controlling outcomes. Instead, we trust relationships to unfold. Where we cling to **power**, we often can’t sustain genuine love—fear or dominance drives the interaction. \n\n**Surrendering illusions of control** fosters humility—accepting that life is co-created with others, with nature, and with forces we cannot manipulate. This humility, ironically, opens the door to a more **flowing, creative life** that resonates with **Fredrickson** (expanding resources), **Csikszentmihályi** (deep involvement), and **Nietzsche** (purposeful endurance).\n\n---\n\n## **6. Brief Historical Context: How We Got So Individualist & Materialist**\n\n1. **Medieval to Early Modern**: In Europe, medieval frameworks mixed spiritual meaning with social hierarchy. But plagues (e.g., Black Death) and religious wars undermined trust in traditional theology.  \n2. **Renaissance & Enlightenment**: Thinkers like **Descartes** emphasized rationality, splitting mind from body. **Hobbes** saw humans as self-interested, in constant competition.  \n3. **Industrial Revolution**: Growth of capitalism rewarded “numbers game,” furthering **materialist** and **individualist** philosophies. **Weber** analyzed the “Protestant work ethic,” linking success to moral virtue.  \n4. **Modern Era**: Overreliance on **measurement, external proof,** rational exploitation of resources, culminating in a society shaped by funnels, tubes, and short-horizon goals.  \n5. **Contemporary Science**: Researchers like **Ian McGilchrist** show the **right hemisphere** holds holistic, relational thinking. Cross-cultural data and neuroscience confirm humans can access intangible states of empathy, awe, spiritual insight. This challenges pure materialism/individualism, revalidating intangible aspects of mind, heart, and relationships.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Putting It All into Practice: Encouraging “Deep Wakefulness” or “Full Engagement”**\n\nBelow is how we integrate everything:\n\n1. **Identify Your IAPs and Enemies**  \n   - Notice repeated states of fear, craving, envy, or pride (Nafs, Shaytan, Hawa, Dunya).  \n   - Write them as attentional policies:  \n     - “MOMENTS of resentment that I latch onto for a feeling of moral high ground.” (Nafs)  \n\n2. **Construct CAPs with Foundational Virtues**  \n   - Flip each IAP into a broad, presence-centered policy:  \n     - “MOMENTS of reflection that invite me to see others’ motives charitably.” (Shaytan → Gratitude/Trust)  \n\n3. **Invite Fredrickson’s Positive Emotions**  \n   - Seek experiences (small joys, social warmth) that **broaden** your perspective, reinforcing your CAP.  \n\n4. **Pursue Flow**  \n   - Channel Csikszentmihályi’s conditions for flow: match skill with challenge, find internal goals you love, let time vanish.  \n\n5. **Hold the “Why”**  \n   - Nietzsche: If you know your deeper “why,” you can face adversities. Align tasks with your “why,” or question if they serve it.  \n\n6. **Watch Thoughts → Habits → Character**  \n   - Daily repetition of these CAP-based micro-choices shapes new, abiding traits. Over time, your default orientation is more **loving** than **controlling**.  \n\n7. **Humble Acceptance**  \n   - Acknowledge you can’t control every outcome. Lean into love, letting synergy replace solitary power grabs.  \n\n8. **Historical & Cultural Awareness**  \n   - Realize we inherited an individualist, materialist lens that’s partial. We can re-tap holistic ways (indigenous, spiritual, cross-cultural) or recent neuroscience (McGilchrist) for evidence that life is more than external matter.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Conclusion & Next Steps**\n\nWe can choose from synonyms like **“Deep Wakefulness,” “Fully Engaged,” “Living from the Heart,”** if “come alive” feels too energetic. The essence is:\n\n> 1. **Recognize** the Four Enemies that push short-horizon or fear-based policies.  \n> 2. **Reframe** them into CAPs aligned with virtues.  \n> 3. **Nurture** positivity (Fredrickson), immersion (Flow), unwavering sense of purpose (Nietzsche).  \n> 4. **Remember** that love > power. Humility fosters relationships and synergy.  \n> 5. **Reflect** on how centuries of individualist, materialist thinking overshadow intangible dimensions; yet new insights in neuroscience and humanistic research confirm we can cultivate these intangible states for personal, social, and ecological well-being.\n\nUltimately, whether we call it **“coming alive,” “deeply awake,” or “fully engaged,”** the path remains the same: choose love, humility, and presence over ego, fear, craving, or material obsession. By so doing, we align with a broader, more connected reality that fosters genuine thriving for ourselves and our communities—**no matter how quietly or vibrantly we express it**.",

      "content": "Below is a **theoretical framework** to examine how **different philosophical traditions** converge around the same core idea of living with **intrinsic meaning, presence, and harmony**—akin to what we’ve called *“coming alive,”* *“deep wakefulness,”* or *“vital presence.”* We’ll look at **three other approaches**—Aristotelian “Eudaimonia,” Early Buddhist “Middle Way,” and Daoist “Wu Wei”—and compare how they address similar concerns (e.g., short-horizon gratification vs. deeper flourishing, illusions of control vs. humility, etc.).\n\n---\n\n# **A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR COMPARING DIVERSE “COME ALIVE” PHILOSOPHIES**\n\n## **1. Overarching Questions & Constructs**\n\nWe propose the following **four-part analytic lens** to compare these traditions with our existing meaning-centric approach (the “Four Enemies,” attentional policies, Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build, Csikszentmihályi’s flow, etc.):\n\n1. **Core Metaphysical or Ethical Principle**  \n   - What ultimate principle or concept drives the tradition’s idea of the “good life” or “meaningful existence”?  \n2. **View of Human Disposition**  \n   - Are humans seen as rational, emotional, or prone to illusions? How do they handle short-term impulses vs. long-term well-being?  \n3. **Prescriptions for Practices or Virtues**  \n   - Which behaviors, virtues, or disciplines lead from illusions or suffering toward flourishing?  \n4. **Overlaps with “Vital Presence / Coming Alive”**  \n   - How does the tradition handle intrinsic motivation, presence, humility, or relational synergy?\n\nWe’ll apply this to **three** philosophies: **Aristotle’s Eudaimonia (Greek)**, **Early Buddhist Middle Way (Indic)**, and **Daoist Wu Wei (Chinese)**.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Three Illustrative Approaches**\n\n### **2.1 Aristotelian Eudaimonia (Greek)**\n\n1. **Core Metaphysical or Ethical Principle**  \n   - **Eudaimonia** translates roughly to “flourishing” or “living well.” Aristotle sees the ultimate human end (telos) as living in accordance with reason and virtue, achieving a life of *arête* (excellence).\n2. **View of Human Disposition**  \n   - Humans have the capacity for reason (the “rational soul”) but are also driven by appetites and habits. Without proper cultivation, we slide into *akrasia* (weakness of will).\n3. **Prescriptions for Practices or Virtues**  \n   - **Golden Mean**: practice moderation in all virtues (courage between cowardice and recklessness, etc.).  \n   - **Habit-Building**: repeated “right actions” shape character, leading to stable virtue.\n4. **Overlap with “Vital Presence / Coming Alive”**  \n   - Like our meaning-centric framework, **Aristotle** emphasizes **intrinsic living**: you do virtuous acts *for their own sake*, not purely for external reward.  \n   - His “golden mean” approach parallels the **CAP** notion: avoid extremes of short-term indulgence or superficial illusions, find the balanced “mean” that fosters *arete*.  \n   - **Nietzsche’s** “why” and the “thoughts→habits→destiny” concept resonates with Aristotle’s repeated virtuous acts forging a consistent, flourishing character.\n\n---\n\n### **2.2 Early Buddhist Middle Way (Indic)**\n\n1. **Core Metaphysical or Ethical Principle**  \n   - **Four Noble Truths**: life has suffering (dukkha), caused by craving (tanhā), which can cease through the **Middle Way** of the Noble Eightfold Path.  \n   - The ultimate aim: liberation from *dukkha*, realized in part by recognizing impermanence and non-self.\n2. **View of Human Disposition**  \n   - Humans are prone to illusions (*avidyā* or ignorance), craving, and aversion. We latch onto ephemeral “enemies” (in Sufi terms, Hawa or Shaytan illusions).  \n   - Also, we can cultivate clarity and compassion, discovering deeper states of mindful awareness.\n3. **Prescriptions for Practices or Virtues**  \n   - **Noble Eightfold Path**: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.  \n   - Emphasis on **“middle”** approach—avoiding extremes of self-indulgence or self-mortification, akin to a path that fosters **flow** and positive emotion (Fredrickson’s “broaden”) rather than rigid asceticism or hedonism.\n4. **Overlap with “Vital Presence / Coming Alive”**  \n   - **Mindfulness & Compassion** evoke the “broaden and build” dimension, not driven by power or craving.  \n   - The focus on letting go of illusions parallels **Shaytan** (scattered illusions) or **Hawa** (cravings).  \n   - “Come Alive” here is akin to being “fully awake” or *Buddha*, grounded in compassion, open awareness—similar to the “CAP” approach of dwelling in each moment’s inherent meaning.\n\n---\n\n### **2.3 Daoist Wu Wei (Chinese)**\n\n1. **Core Metaphysical or Ethical Principle**  \n   - **Wu Wei**: “non-forcing” or “effortless action,” aligning with the **Dao** (the Way) rather than fighting it.  \n   - The Dao is the unnameable flow of reality; living in harmony with it fosters ease and spontaneity.\n2. **View of Human Disposition**  \n   - Humans become entangled in artificial rules, power struggles, or illusions of control (like Nafs and Dunya).  \n   - Our natural disposition is to flow in harmony with nature if we release greed, pride, and contrivance.\n3. **Prescriptions for Practices or Virtues**  \n   - **Simplicity**: reduce desires, social vanities, or forced structures.  \n   - **Non-attachment**: If you truly yield, actions become effortless and correct.  \n   - **Naturalness (Ziran)**: aligning with how things spontaneously emerge.\n4. **Overlap with “Vital Presence / Coming Alive”**  \n   - Wu Wei resonates with *Flow* states: minimal friction, un-self-conscious immersion in the present.  \n   - Emphasis on non-dominance (love over power) parallels humility in the presence of the Dao.  \n   - “Come alive” can be read as “return to the uncarved block,” letting intrinsic nature shine.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Similarities & Differences Across These Traditions**\n\n### **3.1 Similarities**\n\n1. **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic**: All speak of **virtue or alignment** that arises from an internal orientation or deeper harmony, not external compulsion or fleeting rewards.  \n2. **Avoiding Extremes**: The “middle” approach in Buddhism, the “golden mean” in Aristotle, and “non-forcing” in Daoism each caution against overindulgence or rigid asceticism—similar to balancing short-horizon IAP tasks with CAP-based meaning.  \n3. **Habits/Practice**: All propose systematic practice—be it virtue cultivation (Aristotle), eightfold path (Buddhism), or living in the Dao (Daoism).  \n4. **Release of Control**: They highlight letting go of obsessive control or illusions—akin to the humility > power concept in the Sufi “love vs. dominion” perspective.\n\n### **3.2 Differences**\n\n1. **Metaphysical Depth**:  \n   - Aristotle’s is more “virtue ethics” without overt spiritual metaphysics.  \n   - Buddhism, Daoism each carry deeper cosmic or existential assumptions about reality (impermanence, emptiness, or the Dao).  \n2. **End Goal**:  \n   - **Aristotle** aims at “Eudaimonia” in a civic context.  \n   - **Buddhism** aims at liberation from suffering, transcendence.  \n   - **Daoism** aims at effortless harmony with the Way.  \n3. **Approach to Desire**:  \n   - **Aristotle** moderates desires (golden mean).  \n   - **Buddhism** sees many desires as illusions that must be comprehended and let go.  \n   - **Daoism** sees contrived desires as distortions, preferring natural spontaneity.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Proposed Comparative Theoretical Framework**\n\nBased on these traditions plus the **Sufi/Four Enemies** lens, we can create a **four-axis** analysis:\n\n1. **Human Nature Axis**: Are humans inherently rational, selfish, ignorant, or relational? E.g., Aristotle: rational potential with moral habit formation; Buddhism: ignorance leading to suffering; Daoism: primal alignment overshadowed by artifice; Sufi lens: ephemeral illusions from four enemies.  \n2. **Core Lived Experience**: Eudaimonia, Nirvana or Freed Mind, Wu Wei, “Come Alive.” Each tradition identifies a state where we abide in intrinsic fulfillment.  \n3. **Roadblocks / Opposing Forces**: The parallels to the “Four Enemies” or illusions: overcontrol, illusions, craving, narcissism, etc.  \n4. **Method / Path**: Virtuous habit (Aristotle), eightfold path (Buddhism), non-forcing spontaneity (Daoism), or CAP-based living (Sufi/Edelman approach).\n\nThis matrix of analysis can reveal how each system:\n\n- Diagnoses the “block”  \n- Prescribes a path of practice or discipline  \n- Aims at a final “flourishing” or “liberation” akin to “vital presence.”\n\n---\n\n## **5. Conclusion: Convergent Wisdom on “Come Alive” States**\n\nFrom **Greek Eudaimonia** to **Buddhist Middle Way** to **Daoist Wu Wei**—and further bridging with **Sufi Enemies** and **modern psychological theories** (Fredrickson, Csikszentmihályi)—we see:\n\n1. **A universal sense** that short-horizon illusions, cravings, or controlling power stifle our deeper potential.  \n2. **A call** to cultivate humility, moderation, or non-forcing as an antidote—thus freeing us to dwell in a more **intrinsic, fulfilling state** that spontaneously benefits self and others.  \n3. **Diverse language** for “coming alive,” “waking up,” “flow,” or “living by virtue,” all capturing the **shared** idea that we must align with a broader, intangible reality (the “Dao,” communal well-being, spiritual truth, or eudaimonia).\n\nHence, while the details differ, these philosophies similarly champion a mode of being that is *intrinsically meaningful, less ego-driven, and more open to love and humility,* precisely the synergy our “meaning-centric approach” has been emphasizing.",

      "content": "Okay. So I'm curious What might be novel and interesting in our framework I'm really trying to come up with something that is Basically, true Used 4 And I Helps people access energy and meaning and vitality and at the same time, kind of reliably puts them into a place of contribution that iOS what is needed Essentially, from them. And I know that it might be complicated or complex or not exactly A formula that we can say, okay. X plus y plus z to this. But I think the thing that we're trying to do is really capitalize on this Insight that attention And the Way that we feel after enduring attending to things is a rich source of information that isn't being well utilized by many people. Because and and not even just well utilized, but there's, like, some sort of negative feedback loop where some ways of attending lead to a constrict world view. And so these ideas from the broaden and build versus I don't know what you would call the other direction. Narrow and Constrict And depletes or something. I don't know. And then flow states, of, like, increased learning, increased contribution. I think there was some research on the people in flow states also being those that contribute the best or the most or something like that. And I This sort of idea for from Ian McElchrist that that There's a part of our mind that is this wide open space, and that's Able to see the hole and to understand potentially where there are things that are needed. And he even says that there's, like, 97% of our worldview is in that, the whole seeing part of our mind, and then this part that is about grasping holding, acting, power, is very narrow. So I feel like Bharad in and build and Ian's different kinds of hemisphere really connect together in making this argument And I'm wondering about flow. And if it does, I think it does in a different way. It does because some of the way that the Constricted Instrumental way of thinking requires us to be is smart successful, intelligent, We sort of begin to believe that we don't deserve existence if are not these things. And so we might bite off more than we can chew and in doing so, we wind up getting to a really unflowy way of being because we've selected an activity or task that's beyond our capacity rather than seeing the the hole, and acting from that right hemisphere way that is able to under the And broader perspective, and isn't so Needy to, Be just, Doing and acting all the time There's a place of knowing where we can Contribute. Right? Contribute our Our gift And a very different place of being to think and act in that way. And I think that there's a way of operationalizing all of this using the idea of attentional policies Joe Edelman with the noun phrase and then the short descriptive section and following all of the the know, methods for constitutive attentional policies and I'm wondering, like, if there's a way of really understanding constituent potential policies and Ian McGill Christ work on the right hemisphere like, what is it about these ways of being that seem to be so To be constitutive, you know? And what is doing the con This What is doing the And is it possible to do the constitutive stuff without submission. Yeah. Like, it's like, Like a gear. That is trucking on is slightly out of place and it's gonna get mashed up a bit. Until it's in the right place. It's like everything is telling it. That it's, like, out of alignment. You know? And, it's gonna it's gonna get ground down. And and or you just let go and let yourself be removed and replaced or something that. I think it was a better, less mechanical, less forced analogy. I think there's something about that. Right? It's like There there is a fundamental awareness a realization that all is well and beautiful and good and true. And that We can try to you know, get our own way and have our ego Sort of dominate, and we can try to get our own way and Listen to our lower desires We can try to get our own way and just get scattered and distracted and avoid this the difficulty of submission and of letting ourselves go and not listening to the demonic and the the scattering demonic. And we can try to also that Yeah. Realize that our Our knees are easy to satisfy. You know, And our desires are not that big. We don't have to hyperfixate on them. And when we don't, fixate on these desires, it's a process of them lowering connection to our ego and all the rest kind of come tumbling away like there's connection, I think, between desires and ego And security and safety and real success in being in the right place at the right time doing the right thing. For beautiful, good, and true reasons. Right? So how does this all connect?",

      "content": "Below is a **synthesized perspective** that attempts to bring together:\n\n- **Joe Edelman’s** approach to attentional policies (IAPs vs. CAPs)  \n- **Ian McGilchrist’s** hemisphere model (narrow “grasping” vs. broad “opening”)  \n- **Fredrickson’s** Broaden-and-Build theory  \n- **Csikszentmihályi’s** Flow concept  \n- **Sufi Four Enemies** (and the idea of “submission” or humility)  \n\nAll in a way that **explains what’s novel** about this combined framework, and how it might function as a coherent lens on “contribution,” “meaning,” “letting go of ego,” and “being in the right place at the right time for the right reasons.”\n\n---\n\n## **1. Overall Novelty & Purpose**\n\n### **1.1 What’s New Here?**\n\nMany frameworks talk about:\n1. **Positive emotional states** (Broaden-and-Build, Flow).  \n2. **Hemispheric balance** (McGilchrist).  \n3. **Ego subjugation** (Sufi or other spiritual traditions).  \n4. **Attentional clarity** (Edelman’s CAP vs. IAP).  \n\n**What’s novel** in bringing all of them together is:\n\n1. **Attentional Policies** as the operational “bridge.”  \n   - Instead of vague advice (“be mindful,” “be humble,” “seek flow”), we can **operationalize** them via “noun + descriptive phrase” to define exactly **what** a person pays attention to, and how it fosters synergy across these different theories.\n\n2. **Submission / letting go** as the synergy mechanism.  \n   - The user “releases” illusions of control (Nafs, illusions from Shaytan, etc.), opening to **right-hemisphere** broadness (McGilchrist), which in turn correlates with the “broaden” effect (Fredrickson) and fosters conditions for “flow” (Csikszentmihályi).\n\n3. **Constrict vs. Broaden** as a unifying principle for the tension between love and power.  \n   - A “power” orientation typically leads to a “narrow, controlling” approach (left hemisphere overreach, instrumental attentional policies).  \n   - A “love” orientation fosters “broaden and build,” giving space for synergy (the right hemisphere’s bigger, holistic approach).\n\nThus, **the novelty** is weaving all these strands into a single, structured practice: using “attentional policies” to **notice** when we’re in a “narrow, forcing, controlling” mode vs. a “broad, open, trusting” mode, and systematically re-align our daily states toward the latter.\n\n### **1.2 Why This Helps People “Access Energy and Meaning”**\n\n- By **identifying** each false “enemy” tension (ego, impulse, illusions, materialism) as *narrow* or *constrictive* ways of attending, we can see why we lose energy (the “narrow and deplete” loop).  \n- By **moving** to CAPs that revolve around humility, letting go, or open curiosity, we literally *broaden* mental scope, increasing energy, possibility, and collaboration.  \n- **Flow states** require enough challenge to engage, but not so much that fear or illusions take over. The broad-attention approach helps us choose tasks “within capacity” but meaningfully challenging. Meanwhile, letting go of ego-laden or forced tasks also frees up energy.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Deeper Dive into Each Concept’s “Constrict vs. Broaden” Polarity**\n\n### **2.1 McGilchrist’s Hemispheres**\n\n1. **Left Hemisphere**:  \n   - “Constrict” approach: tries to grasp, label, measure, control. Focuses on small slices.  \n   - Tied to short-horizon tasks (IAP-like).  \n2. **Right Hemisphere**:  \n   - “Broaden” approach: sees context, relationships, the intangible “whole.”  \n   - Tied to open, flexible attentional stances (CAP-like).  \n\n**Novel Angle**: The Sufi notion of “submission” aligns with letting the right hemisphere lead, trusting the bigger picture rather than forcing solutions from the narrow viewpoint.\n\n### **2.2 Fredrickson’s Broaden-and-Build**\n\n1. **Broaden**: Positive affect (love, curiosity, gratitude) leads to mental expansion.  \n2. **Build**: Over time, these states accumulate resources (skills, relationships, resilience).\n\n**Novel Angle**:  \n- “Submission” to humility or trust fosters these positive states (rather than anxiety or ego).  \n- We can map negative emotional loops (Nafs, Shaytan illusions, etc.) as “narrow and constrict.”\n\n### **2.3 Csikszentmihályi’s Flow**\n\n1. **Flow** arises when skill matches challenge, with a sense of integrated immersion.  \n2. Contrasts with a controlling, extrinsic approach where we’re either overstretched or bored, losing “flow.”\n\n**Novel Angle**:  \n- The “submission” dimension means we pick challenges that align with deeper callings, not forcibly “biting off more than we can chew” from fear or ego-lust for status.  \n- Flow becomes a hallmark of “broaden” states at the right skill-challenge ratio.\n\n### **2.4 Sufi Four Enemies as “Narrow or Distorted” Modes**\n\n1. **Nafs**: Over-control from ego (resisting the broad vantage that we’re part of a bigger tapestry).  \n2. **Shaytan**: Scattering illusions, fear-based suspicion.  \n3. **Hawa**: Impulsive hedonism, ignoring the bigger sense of context.  \n4. **Dunya**: Materialistic attachments, chasing external metrics.  \n\n**Novel Angle**:  \n- Each is a “narrow” or “twisted” attentional path, denying the broader relational or humble approach.  \n- “Submission” is the antidote to illusions of control or illusions of must-have gratification.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Operationalizing Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs)**\n\n### **3.1 Format Matters**\n\nRecall Joe Edelman’s recommended format:  \n> **Noun phrase** (the kind of event or phenomenon) + **a descriptive phrase** clarifying how we attend to it.\n\n### **3.2 Example CAPs That “Broaden” & Encourage Flow / Right Hemisphere**\n\n1. **MOMENTS of pausing** to sense whether I truly have capacity for this new task.  \n   - Encourages humility (Nafs antidote), fosters healthy challenge boundaries for flow.\n\n2. **CHOICES to step back** and see the bigger relational or ecological context before acting.  \n   - Helps avoid Shaytan’s illusions or Dunya’s obsession with immediate advantage.\n\n3. **EMOTIONAL signals** in the body that I greet with warmth and curiosity, rather than shaming or indulgence.  \n   - Counters Hawa’s impulsivity, fosters presence (flow readiness).\n\n4. **SPACES of collaboration** where I intentionally invite others to guide me if they have deeper insight.  \n   - Minimizes ego-power stance, embraces positive synergy.\n\n---\n\n## **4. The Role of Submission or “Letting Go”\n\n**Central** to Sufi tradition, “submission” can seem negative to Western individualism. But in this integrated sense, submission means:\n\n- Letting go of illusions that you alone must fix, grasp, or prove everything.  \n- Trusting a broader synergy (the right hemisphere’s open vantage, the community, or the bigger “spiritual” dimension).  \n- Releasing the friction that arises from constant personal struggle for “control” (the “power vs. love” tension).\n\n**Mechanically**:\n\n1. Let go of the “narrow channel” or forced approach.  \n2. Lean into a broader, intangible sense—could be called “love,” “humility,” or “flow.”  \n3. This fosters “broaden” states that build resources, ironically making you more *able* to contribute effectively.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Historical or Cultural Evidence**\n\nWe see parallel ideas in:\n\n- **Indigenous** approaches that emphasize cyclical, communal relational knowledge over linear control.  \n- **Taoist** Wu Wei or “natural flow.”  \n- **Buddhist** mindfulness that sees illusions of self-importance or craving.  \n\nIan McGilchrist’s research suggests ~97% of our worldview is shaped by the broader relational sense (right hemisphere) if we let it. He references neurology and cultural history to show how leaning too hard on the narrow side leads to a crisis of meaning.\n\n---\n\n## **6. How This Converges on “Contribution That Is Needed”\n\nWhen we adopt broad, humble attention:\n\n- We see the “whole” better, thus **noticing** real needs and gaps.  \n- Freed from petty illusions (Four Enemies) or narrow self-driven aims, we spontaneously sense how our gifts might serve.  \n- In *Flow,* we slip into tasks that match our skill and bring deep joy *and* can be beneficial to the group.  \n- *Broaden and Build* ensures we keep building social ties, knowledge, and synergy, so we “naturally” fill roles that the ecosystem needs, rather than artificially forcing ourselves into positions for status or fear.\n\nHence, combining these insights yields a **reliable** approach:  \n> *Surrender illusions, cultivate broad positive attentional states, choose challenges that align with deeper capacity and context, and watch how that synergy fosters genuine, beneficial contribution.*\n\n---\n\n## **7. Summary of the Integrative Approach**\n\n1. **Recognize Constrict vs. Broaden**  \n   - Constrict = left-hemisphere overfocus, negative emotional loops (Four Enemies).  \n   - Broaden = open, trusting, submission to bigger context.  \n2. **Attentional Policies** are the Key**  \n   - Identify IAPs: “MOMENTS or CHOICES or THOUGHTS…” that revolve around fear or control.  \n   - Replace them with CAPs: expansions that promote humility, clarity, synergy.  \n3. **Fredrickson & Flow**  \n   - Build positive emotional resource, choose “just-right” challenges that elicit flow.  \n   - Reduces friction, fosters generosity, collaboration, and well-being.  \n4. **Submission** to the intangible “whole”**  \n   - Let go of the illusions of self-sufficiency or forced power.  \n   - Paradoxically leads to being in the “right place, right time,” contributing effectively.  \n\n**All** of these steps are **not** “one simple formula,” but a dynamic practice. Yet it is systematic enough to be taught: we can **train** attentional shifts, journaling CAP statements, monitoring which “enemy” is grabbing us, and re-centering in love over power. Over time, this synergy can become a normal mode of being.\n\n---\n\n## **8. Concluding Remarks**\n\n**The big picture** is that we have a unifying vantage:  \n- **McGilchrist**’s “broad, open hemisphere” matches “submission and trust” in the bigger relational field.  \n- **Flow** and **broaden-and-build** show how positive orientation and skill-challenge balance produce real growth and synergy.  \n- **Four Enemies** represent the typical illusions that break that synergy.  \n- **Attentional policies** operationalize daily practice to stay in the “broaden” mode.  \n- **Submission** is the final pivot: relinquishing the narrow illusions to let intangible guidance (love, humility, synergy) lead.\n\n**Thus** we can meet both personal longing for “meaning, energy, vitality” *and* the communal need for real contribution—because living from this broader vantage inherently tunes us to collective well-being.",

      "content": "### Breakdown of the Prompt Structure  \n\nJoe's prompt is structured into distinct sections, each with a specific purpose. Below is an analysis of these chunks, explaining how they work and why they make this a strong prompt.\n\n---\n\n### **1. System Definition & Role Setting**  \n#### **What This Section Does:**\n- Clearly defines the assistant’s **role**: A “meaning assistant” that helps the user articulate their “source of meaning.”\n- Establishes the **objective**: Guide the user toward deeper self-understanding and collect wisdom to improve AI and social structures.\n- Specifies **tools**: The assistant provides \"values cards\" and follows a structured process.\n\n#### **Why This Is Effective:**\n✅ **Clarity of Purpose** – The AI is given a well-defined role, preventing ambiguity in responses.  \n✅ **Aligns with User Intent** – The assistant is framed as helpful but not overly authoritative, making it approachable.  \n✅ **Broadens Impact** – Connects personal reflection to larger systems (wise AI, wise social structures), giving the interactions greater significance.  \n\n#### **Possible Improvement:**\n- The mention of \"wise AI and wise social structures\" is ambitious but vague. It could be clearer how the AI's responses contribute to this goal.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Conceptual Foundation (Sources of Meaning & Attention Policies)**  \n#### **What This Section Does:**\n- Defines **key concepts** the assistant must understand:\n  - A “source of meaning” is more than just a preference; it is a **way of living** that opens up possibilities.  \n  - A “source of meaning” is defined by **attention policies**, specific things a person finds meaningful to focus on.  \n- Provides an **example** of attention policies related to group decision-making.\n\n#### **Why This Is Effective:**\n✅ **Prevents Misinterpretation** – Instead of assuming generic values, the AI is guided to look for deeper, personal structures of meaning.  \n✅ **Encourages Depth** – Moves beyond clichés and broad statements (e.g., “authenticity”) by prompting precise, experience-based reflections.  \n✅ **Guides the AI’s Logic** – The explicit distinction between a goal and a source of meaning prevents shallow interpretations.\n\n#### **Possible Improvement:**\n- This section is dense with abstract definitions. It could benefit from a short analogy or real-world example to make it more accessible.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Interaction Process (Step-by-Step User Guidance)**  \n#### **What This Section Does:**\nOutlines a **5-step conversational structure** the AI must follow:\n1. Start with a personal story, emotion, role model, or dilemma.  \n2. Zoom in on the source of meaning.  \n3. Ask questions to gather a set of attention policies.  \n4. Confirm understanding with the user.  \n5. Submit a values card.\n\n#### **Why This Is Effective:**\n✅ **Prevents Meandering Conversations** – The structured sequence ensures the AI doesn’t get lost in tangents.  \n✅ **Encourages Personalization** – By starting with personal stories and emotions, the interaction feels meaningful and not generic.  \n✅ **Builds in Confirmation** – The step of checking attention policies with the user ensures accuracy before submitting a values card.\n\n#### **Possible Improvement:**\n- A visual representation of this process (like a decision tree) could make it clearer.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Style & Communication Guidelines**  \n#### **What This Section Does:**\n- Defines the **tone** the assistant should adopt:\n  - Speak as a **close friend** (casual, warm, personal).  \n  - **Do not flatter** the user (avoids over-validation).  \n  - **Avoid jargon** (don’t use terms like “attention policies” directly).  \n  - **Relate to the user’s experiences** by referencing stories, books, or movies.  \n  - **Ask one question at a time** to maintain conversational flow.  \n\n#### **Why This Is Effective:**\n✅ **Makes AI Feel Human** – The warmth and relatability prevent sterile or overly robotic interactions.  \n✅ **Maintains Depth Without Overwhelm** – Avoiding jargon keeps the experience accessible.  \n✅ **Encourages Natural Flow** – Limiting questions per response ensures a better dialogue experience.\n\n#### **Possible Improvement:**\n- The rule against flattery could be nuanced. Encouraging responses like “That’s an insightful perspective” (without empty praise) might improve engagement.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Techniques for Zooming In on Sources of Meaning**  \n#### **What This Section Does:**\n- Provides methods to **help the AI identify sources of meaning** from different conversational entry points:\n  - **From Goals** – Ask how the goal aligns with their way of living.  \n  - **From Feelings** – Map emotions to deeper meanings.  \n  - **From Moral Principles & Norms** – Distinguish between extrinsic obligations and intrinsic meaning.  \n\n#### **Why This Is Effective:**\n✅ **Gives AI Specific Strategies** – Helps structure responses rather than leaving the AI to guess.  \n✅ **Encourages Meaningful Exploration** – Ensures the AI doesn’t just take user statements at face value but investigates underlying motivations.  \n✅ **Balances Emotional Sensitivity** – Acknowledges negative emotions without dismissing them, using them as signals for deeper values.  \n\n#### **Possible Improvement:**\n- The emotion mapping rules (e.g., fear → threatened, anger → blocked) could be more nuanced to accommodate mixed emotions.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Writing & Formatting Attention Policies**  \n#### **What This Section Does:**\n- Provides a structured format for how the assistant should **write values cards**:\n  1. **Use plural noun phrases** (e.g., “MOMENTS,” “CHOICES”).  \n  2. **Write from the user’s perspective** (what *they* should notice).  \n  3. **Use general words** to keep policies applicable.  \n  4. **Be precise** and avoid vague terms like “meaningful.”  \n\n#### **Why This Is Effective:**\n✅ **Ensures Consistency** – Standardizing attention policies prevents vague or useless results.  \n✅ **Helps AI Communicate Clearly** – The specific format makes it easier for the user to interpret the values card.  \n✅ **Forces Depth** – By requiring precision, it prevents generic or superficial insights.\n\n#### **Possible Improvement:**\n- Some flexibility in formatting might be helpful for cases where strict noun phrases don’t fit well.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Strengths of This Prompt**  \n✅ **Highly Structured Yet Flexible** – The assistant follows a defined process but still adapts to the user’s responses.  \n✅ **Encourages Meaningful Reflection** – Instead of just answering questions, the AI helps users articulate deeper truths about themselves.  \n✅ **Avoids Common Pitfalls** – By rejecting flattery, avoiding jargon, and structuring responses, it sidesteps generic AI mistakes.  \n✅ **Balances Theory & Practice** – Abstract ideas (meaning, values) are translated into actionable conversation strategies.\n\n---\n\n### **Areas for Potential Refinement**\n🔹 **Complexity & Length** – While thorough, this prompt could be overwhelming. A condensed version with modular sections might improve readability.  \n🔹 **More Real-World Examples** – Theoretical definitions could benefit from practical illustrations (e.g., case studies, user dialogues).  \n🔹 **Nuancing Emotion Handling** – Not all negative emotions mean a missing value; sometimes, they reflect conflicting values.  \n🔹 **Potential Over-Reliance on Format** – While formatting guidelines are great, some flexibility in attention policies might allow for richer responses.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nJoe’s prompt is a **masterfully structured** guide that ensures meaningful, engaging, and structured AI interactions. It blends **depth, process clarity, and warmth**, making it a strong model for designing prompts that facilitate deep reflection. However, some **simplification and additional examples** could enhance usability while maintaining its powerful core principles.",
