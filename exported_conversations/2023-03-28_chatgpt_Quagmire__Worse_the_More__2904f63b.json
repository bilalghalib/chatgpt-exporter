It refers to a difficult or complicated situation that is hard to escape from, and where any action taken to resolve it seems to make it worse. The word can be used to describe physical situations such as being stuck in quicksand, as well as non-physical situations such as being involved in a complicated problem or relationship.",

This refers to a situation where continued effort is unlikely to produce any positive outcome and can even make the situation worse. It implies a sense of hopelessness and a recognition that further action would be pointless or counterproductive. So, in the situations you described where continuing to act would only exacerbate the problem, the word \"futile\" could be used to convey the idea that it is better to stop and reassess before taking any further action.",

In that case, the saying you might be thinking of is \"don't make a bad situation worse.\" This means that when you are already in a difficult or challenging situation, it is important to avoid actions that could potentially make the situation even worse. It is better to pause, reflect and seek a new approach rather than continue to act in a way that only exacerbates the problem. This saying is often used as a cautionary reminder to avoid impulsive or rash actions that could lead to further complications.",
