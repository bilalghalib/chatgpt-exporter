      "content": "If we are looking for a novel that is often considered as representative or iconic of Britain, then \"1984\" by George Orwell could be seen as a comparable counterpart to \"The Great Gatsby\" in America. \"1984\" is a dystopian novel that explores themes such as government surveillance, totalitarianism, and the manipulation of truth. It is widely regarded as a classic work of literature and has had a significant impact on popular culture and political discourse.",

      "content": "\"The Catcher in the Rye\" by J.D. Salinger is a quintessential American novel that explores themes of teenage angst, alienation, and disillusionment. In France, a similar novel that is often considered as representative of French literature is \"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus. Like \"The Catcher in the Rye\", \"The Stranger\" deals with existentialist themes such as the meaninglessness of life, isolation, and the search for identity. It is also a classic work of literature that has had a significant impact on French culture and beyond.",
