      "content": "If you're a U.S. citizen residing in France and you want to vote in Michigan for the 2024 elections, here's what you need to do:\n\n1. **Register to Vote and Request an Absentee Ballot**: \n   - You must register to vote and request an absentee ballot using the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA). You can fill out the FPCA online at [FVAP.gov](https://www.fvap.gov/) (Federal Voting Assistance Program).\n   - Once completed, you can either mail, email, or fax it to your local election office in Michigan. Be sure to check the submission deadlines on FVAP to ensure your ballot arrives on time.\n\n2. **Receive Your Ballot**: \n   - Once your FPCA is processed, you will receive an absentee ballot either electronically or by mail, depending on what you selected when filling out the FPCA.\n\n3. **Fill Out and Return Your Ballot**:\n   - Follow the instructions that come with the absentee ballot. Be sure to sign any necessary forms and complete the ballot properly.\n   - Return your ballot either by postal mail, fax, or email, depending on the options provided by Michigan. Postal mail is the most common method, so allow plenty of time for international mail.\n\n4. **Use the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB) as a Backup**:\n   - If you don’t receive your official absentee ballot in time, you can use the FWAB as a backup ballot. This form is also available at [FVAP.gov](https://www.fvap.gov/fwab-privacy-notice).\n\nCheck the deadlines for absentee ballots and make sure your vote is sent in time to be counted!",
