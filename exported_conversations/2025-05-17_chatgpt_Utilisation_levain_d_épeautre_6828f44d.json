      "content": "This product is **organic spelt sourdough starter (levain d’épeautre bio)**. It contains dried and inactive spelt sourdough, meant to be used as a **leavening agent** when baking bread. Here’s how to use it, based on the French instructions on the package:\n\n---\n\n### **Manual Use (by hand):**\n1. **Mix:**\n   - 500g of flour  \n   - 8g of salt  \n   - 21g of this **spelt sourdough starter**  \n   - 2 tablespoons of oil (optional)  \n   - Around **350 ml of lukewarm water (approx. 28°C)**\n\n2. **Knead the dough** until smooth and elastic.\n\n3. **Let rest for 30 minutes** in a bowl covered with a cloth.\n\n4. **Knead again briefly**, shape your dough into a ball or loaf and place it in a warm area (about 20°C) to rise.\n\n5. **Fermentation Time:**\n   - Let rise for a **minimum of 2 hours** at around 20°C.\n   - Then place the dough into a **preheated oven (220–230°C)**.\n   - **Bake for about 45 minutes**.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- This is **not an active yeast** but a **natural leaven** made from spelt—so it's meant to give flavor and help with fermentation.\n- The longer rising time is necessary because it doesn't work as fast as commercial baker’s yeast.\n\nWould you like me to help adapt this to a sourdough spelt bread recipe with added ingredients like seeds, dried fruit, or nuts?",

      "content": "Great question — here’s the key distinction:\n\n### What You’re Holding:\nThis is **dried and inactive spelt sourdough starter** (\"levain d’épeautre déshydraté et désactivé\").  \nIt’s made from natural fermentation but **has no live yeast or bacteria left** — it's primarily used for **flavor** and **mild leavening support**, not as a living starter.\n\n### So Is It Sourdough?\nTechnically, **no** — it's not *active sourdough starter*. It's more like **a flavoring and fermentation aid**, closer to a dried “sourdough powder.”\n\n---\n\n### What You Should Do:\nSince you **have a live sourdough starter**, that’s the real deal.\n\nHere are your options:\n\n#### **Option 1: Use Only Your Live Starter**\n- Skip this powder entirely.\n- Use your mature sourdough starter (e.g. 20–30% of your flour weight) as usual.\n\n#### **Option 2: Use Both**\n- Use your live sourdough as the **main leavening agent**.\n- Add **5–10g of this spelt powder per 500g flour** for extra **flavor depth** (like a boost of aged sour character from spelt).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Don’t rely on this powder alone for fermentation.**\n- **Yes, you can and probably should use your real sourdough starter.**\n- This powder can enhance flavor, especially if you're baking with white flour or want a touch of spelt complexity.\n\nWant a spelt-enhanced sourdough bread recipe with this included?",

      "content": "Excellent follow-up — this is a subtle point, and you're right to be confused.\n\n### Here’s the nuance:\n\nThe product says:\n> *\"Cette levure en synergie avec le levain d’épeautre va développer des parfums très agréables au cours de la fermentation, mais elle nécessite un temps de pousse adapté.\"*\n\n**Translation:**\n> “This yeast, in synergy with the spelt sourdough, will develop very pleasant aromas during fermentation, but it requires an appropriate rise time.”\n\nSo:\n\n### There **is** yeast in it — but not *active* wild sourdough culture.\n\nAccording to the ingredients:\n- **Farine d’épeautre déshydratée et dévitalisée** = dehydrated and devitalized spelt flour (i.e. no living sourdough microbes).\n- **Levure de fermentation naturelle** = natural fermentation yeast\n- **Levure sélectionnée** = selected yeast\n\nThis implies that **they added baker's yeast (probably dry yeast)** to the mix, which **is active**, even if the spelt levain part is not.\n\n---\n\n### So what is this product?\n\nIt’s a **hybrid pre-mix**:\n- **Inactive spelt sourdough** = for flavor (not rising)\n- **Dry selected yeast** = for actual leavening\n\nThat’s why it can rise *without* a live starter — but it’s **not the same as natural sourdough**, which relies on wild bacteria + yeast living in symbiosis.\n\n---\n\n### Should you still use your sourdough starter?\nYes — **if you want full sourdough fermentation**, use your own starter. This product is more like a “sourdough-flavored instant yeast mix.”\n\nYou can:\n- Use it as **a flavor enhancer** in your sourdough bake (5–10g)\n- Or use it **as a shortcut** if you don’t have time for long fermentation (it still rises thanks to the commercial yeast)\n\nWould you like me to write out a recipe that includes your live starter + a bit of this for extra spelt flavor?",

You're working with:\n\n- **900g wheat flour**\n- **300g sourdough starter** (assuming it's 100% hydration — meaning equal parts flour and water)\n\nLet’s calculate water based on a typical **70–75% hydration dough**, which works well for wheat bread and is manageable to handle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Starter water & flour\nIf your starter is 100% hydration, then:\n- 300g starter = **150g flour + 150g water**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Total flour =  \n**900g (main)** + **150g (from starter)** = **1050g flour**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Total water for 75% hydration =  \n**1050g x 0.75 = 787g water**\n\nYou've already got **150g water** from the starter, so:\n\n### Step 4: Water to add =  \n**787g – 150g = ~637g water**\n\n---\n\n### Final Dough Formula (75% hydration):\n- **900g wheat flour**\n- **300g sourdough starter (100% hydration)**\n- **637g water (to add)**\n- **20g salt** (2% of total flour — optional but recommended)\n\n---\n\nWould you like to add the spelt levain powder for extra flavor?
