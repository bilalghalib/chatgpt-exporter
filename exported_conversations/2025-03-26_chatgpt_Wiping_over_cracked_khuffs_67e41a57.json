      "content": "According to most scholars, if the **leather socks (khuffayn or kaff)** still **cover the area that must be washed during wudu (ablution)** and are generally **intact and wearable**, then a **small tear or crack** — such as one that **light passes through but doesn’t expose significant skin** — does **not invalidate** the permissibility of wiping over them.\n\nHere are some key points:\n\n- **Minor cracks or holes** that don’t expose a large portion of the foot (generally less than the size of three small toes) are overlooked in most schools of thought.\n- If the socks are still **worn as normal socks**, provide **general coverage**, and **stay up on the foot**, they are considered valid for wiping.\n- **Maliki and Hanbali** schools are typically more lenient about this, while the **Hanafi** school might be stricter and consider larger holes problematic.\n\n**So yes**, in most cases, a **tiny crack that lets light through** but doesn’t **expose the skin clearly** or affect the function of the socks is **okay**, and you **can still wipe over them**.\n\nIf you want a ruling according to a specific madhhab (school of thought), I can provide that too.",

      "content": "In the **Maliki school**, wiping over leather socks (*khuffayn*) is **permitted** under certain conditions — and they tend to be **more lenient** than the Hanafis regarding minor defects, including **holes or tears**, even **on the sole**.\n\n### **Maliki Ruling on Holes in the Khuff:**\n\nThe Malikis **do not consider small holes or tears to invalidate** the permissibility of wiping over the khuffayn, **even if they are on the sole** or the bottom of the foot. Their reasoning is based on:\n\n#### 1. **Ease (taysīr) and Customary Use (ʿurf):**\nThey argue that **some wear and tear is normal and inevitable**, and thus minor defects that do **not prevent the khuff from being worn normally** or fulfilling its function (i.e. protecting the foot) do **not prevent wiping**.\n\n> **Qarāfa (a Maliki scholar)** said: \"There is no specific limit [for the hole] because it is not narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him), so it returns to ‘urf (custom) and what is commonly considered a valid sock.\"\n\n#### 2. **Purpose of the Khuff:**\nAs long as the khuff:\n- **Covers the area normally washed in wudu**,  \n- **Stays on the foot without repeatedly falling off**,  \n- **Can be walked in (even a little)**,  \n\nthen **minor holes**, even **on the bottom**, **do not invalidate** it for wiping. This includes cases where **light enters** or **the skin can be seen slightly** through the tear, so long as it’s not a large opening.\n\n### **Bottom Line According to the Maliki School:**\nIf the crack in your **Kaff socks** is **tiny**, even if on the sole, and the socks are:\n- Worn normally,\n- Cover your foot,\n- Not constantly slipping off,\n- And you can walk in them (even just a little),\n\n**You can still wipe over them** during wudu.\n\nWould you like a citation or reference from a classical Maliki source like *al-Mudawwana* or *Mukhtasar Khalil*?",
