They're on a Mac, tethering with their phone, and it was working earlier today. They've already tried clearing DNS cache.\n\nLet me analyze this step by step:\n\n1. Port 443 is HTTPS port - so this is likely a network connectivity issue\n2. Both GitHub and ChatGPT are having issues, suggesting it's not service-specific\n3. They're tethering with phone - this could be the key issue\n4. It was working earlier today, so something changed\n\nThe user preferences indicate they like metaphors, prefer Python for coding, like constructive criticism/pushback, don't like flattery, and only want me to say something is special if it's actually true.\n\nThis seems like a network connectivity issue rather than something that requires web search since it's a technical troubleshooting problem. I should provide direct troubleshooting steps.\n\nLet me think of a good metaphor for this situation - maybe something about phone tethering being like sharing a straw or pipe, and when there are issues it affects everything flowing through it.This sounds like your phone's data connection is having issues - think of it like trying to drink multiple thick shakes through one increasingly clogged straw. Both GitHub and ChatGPT failing suggests the problem is at the network level, not with the individual services.\n\nHere's what to try, in order:\n\n**Quick fixes:**\n- Turn airplane mode on/off on your phone (resets the cellular connection)\n- Disconnect and reconnect the USB tethering \n- Try switching from USB to hotspot tethering or vice versa\n- Check if other devices can connect through your phone's hotspot\n\n**If those don't work:**\n- Restart your phone's cellular radio (airplane mode for 30+ seconds)\n- Try a different APN if you know your carrier's alternates\n- Check your data usage - some carriers throttle after certain limits\n- Test on a different network (coffee shop wifi) to confirm it's tethering-related\n\n**For the GitHub specific issue:**\n```bash\n# Try SSH instead of HTTPS\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git\n\n# Or force HTTPS through a different port\ngit config --global url.\"https://github.com/\".insteadOf git@github.com:\n```\n\nThe \"too many concurrent connections\" error from ChatGPT combined with GitHub's port 443 failure strongly suggests your phone's data connection is struggling with multiple simultaneous HTTPS connections. This often happens when cellular towers are congested or your phone is having trouble maintaining a stable data session.\n\nWhat's your current signal strength, and have you tried moving to a different location?",
