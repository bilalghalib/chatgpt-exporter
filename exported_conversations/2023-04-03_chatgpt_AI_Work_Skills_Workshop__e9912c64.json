      "content": "Great! Here's a potential structure for a 1-hour virtual workshop on AI prompting for work skills that incorporates principles from liberating structures:\n\n1. Introduction (5 minutes)\n   - Start by introducing yourself and explaining the purpose of the workshop.\n   - Explain that the goal of the workshop is to explore how AI prompting can be used to improve work skills.\n   - Provide a brief overview of what AI prompting is and why it is useful.\n   - Explain that the workshop will be interactive and invite participants to share their thoughts and experiences throughout.\n\n2. Background on AI Prompting (10 minutes)\n   - Start by explaining what AI is and how it works.\n   - Explain the concept of AI prompting, and how it can be used to provide prompts and feedback to workers.\n   - Provide examples of how AI prompting has been used successfully in different industries.\n   - Ask participants if they have any questions or comments about what has been discussed so far.\n\n3. Liberating Structure #1: \"1-2-4-All\" (15 minutes)\n   - Explain the \"1-2-4-All\" liberating structure, which encourages individual reflection, small group discussion, and large group sharing.\n   - Ask participants to reflect on the following prompt: \"What are some work skills that you would like to improve?\"\n   - Ask participants to pair up and discuss their responses with each other.\n   - Ask each pair to join another pair to form a group of four, and discuss their responses in the larger group.\n   - Finally, ask the entire group to share any common themes or insights that emerged from the discussion.\n\n4. Applying AI Prompting to Work Skills (15 minutes)\n   - Using the insights and themes from the previous exercise, ask participants to brainstorm different types of AI prompts that could be used to improve work skills.\n   - Encourage participants to be creative and think outside the box.\n   - Ask each participant to share one idea with the group.\n\n5. Liberating Structure #2: \"TRIZ\" (15 minutes)\n   - Explain the \"TRIZ\" liberating structure, which encourages problem-solving and innovation through the use of constraints.\n   - Ask participants to consider the following constraint: \"You can only use visual prompts to improve work skills.\"\n   - Ask participants to brainstorm different visual prompts that could be used to improve work skills, using the constraint as a guide.\n   - Encourage participants to think creatively and challenge themselves to come up with unconventional ideas.\n   - Ask each participant to share one visual prompt with the group.\n\n6. Wrap-Up (5 minutes)\n   - Summarize the key insights and ideas that emerged from the workshop.\n   - Thank participants for their participation and encourage them to continue exploring how AI prompting can be used to improve work skills.\n   - Provide any additional resources or materials that participants can use to learn more about AI prompting.",
