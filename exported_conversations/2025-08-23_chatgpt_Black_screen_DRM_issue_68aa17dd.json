      "content": "Got it — that’s a pretty common situation actually. What you’re describing (sound + subtitles showing, but a black video screen when you try to share it) is usually caused by **Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection**.  \n\nHere’s why:  \n\n- Many movies you download from Apple TV, Netflix, or other services use DRM.  \n- On your MacBook Pro, the hardware (M2 chip + macOS) supports DRM playback, so you can see the video locally.  \n- But when you try to screen share (via Zoom, Google Meet, QuickTime screen recording, etc.), macOS intentionally **blacks out the video feed** to prevent copying.  \n- Subtitles and audio aren’t considered part of the “protected stream,” so those still come through.  \n\nThat’s why it looks “weird”: black video, sound, and subtitles only.  \n\n🔧 **Possible workarounds (legal and practical):**\n1. **Use a non-DRM file** – If it’s from iTunes, Netflix, or similar, there’s no legal way around it. If it’s your own video (e.g. home recording), make sure you’re opening it in VLC or QuickTime directly from your Downloads.  \n2. **Check your player** – Try opening it in VLC Media Player (often avoids DRM issues if the file itself isn’t protected).  \n3. **Share the window vs. the screen** – In Zoom/Meet/Teams, sometimes sharing the whole screen works better than a specific window (or vice versa).  \n4. **Disable hardware acceleration** in Chrome/Zoom – occasionally fixes black screen when sharing.  \n\n👉 Question for you: do you know if this movie was bought/downloaded from iTunes/Apple TV/Netflix, or is it a non-DRM file (like an .mp4 or .mkv from elsewhere)? That’ll tell me if it’s a DRM lockout or just a playback/sharing issue.",

      "content": "Ahhh got it — thanks for clarifying 🙏  \n\nIf you’re **not actively sharing your screen** (like on Zoom/Meet), but your Mac is still showing only **black video + subtitles + audio**, then it could be that:  \n\n1. **A screen recording / screen share tool is running in the background**  \n   - macOS enforces DRM if it detects screen capture software (e.g. OBS, QuickTime recording, even background helper apps).  \n   - Sometimes Zoom, Teams, or Chrome extensions stay “listening” even if you’re not on a call, which triggers the blackout.  \n\n2. **Hardware acceleration / DRM rendering glitch**  \n   - The video is decoded with hardware acceleration, but if something is interfering with that (external monitor, screen recorder permission, etc.), macOS shows black instead.  \n\n3. **External display / HDMI adapter**  \n   - If you’re plugged into a monitor or TV that doesn’t support HDCP (the DRM handshake protocol), your Mac will only play sound + captions, but no video.  \n\n---\n\n✅ **What to try**  \n- Check **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording** and see which apps have permission. If something like Zoom, Chrome, or OBS is toggled on, try disabling it.  \n- Close any conferencing or recording apps running in the background.  \n- If you’re on an external display, try watching directly on your Mac screen.  \n- Try opening the video in **VLC** to see if it bypasses the issue (if it’s not DRM-protected).  \n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to help you check if it’s an **external monitor issue** (HDCP) or a **background screen recording permission** thing?",
