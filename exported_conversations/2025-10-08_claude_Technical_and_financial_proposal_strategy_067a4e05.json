  "summary": "**Conversation Overview**\n\nThe user, Bilal Ghalib, sought help crafting technical and financial proposals for a UNESCO Bangkok consultancy position supporting the Global Citizenship Education (GCED) Network. Based in Lille, France, Bilal has 15 years of experience in transformative education, co-founding Bloom (a venture learning platform that ran 118 accelerator cycles across 16 countries reaching 1,011 teams) and recently completing work with the International Trade Centre in Iraq developing sustainable construction curriculum. He has a master's in Learning Sciences and is pursuing another in Islam and Psychology at Cambridge.\n\nThe UNESCO role requires producing webinar packages, meeting materials, web articles, analytical reports, and strategic planning documents within a compressed 50-day timeline over 3.5 months. Bilal needed help positioning his experience with competency frameworks (EntreComp, GreenComp) as directly relevant to GCED work, emphasizing his cross-cultural program design across Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East, and highlighting gender-responsive programming like HerMeNow (100% women founders working on environmental projects).\n\nClaude helped research and verify the alignment between GCED, EntreComp, and GreenComp frameworks, discovering they share similar competency-based architectures emphasizing knowledge plus skills plus values rather than just cognitive content. The conversation involved multiple iterations refining the proposals' tone from corporate to conversational-professional, incorporating Bloom's specific methodologies (upside-down pyramid for learner agency, Ubuntu philosophy of collective strength, community check-ins), and replacing generic examples with actual Bloom practices like the Golden Circle exercise.\n\nBilal emphasized wanting direct, clear language without jargon or AI writing tells like em dashes, promotional phrases, or superficial analysis. He corrected details about his programs (HerMeNow was 100% women, other Bloom programs were majority women) and stressed his international mentor network where former participants from a decade ago now mentor new cohorts. The final deliverables included a cover letter, technical proposal with methodology grounded in actual practice, financial proposal requesting $500/day (flexible to $450-475), and descriptions of relevant work samples. Bilal expressed interest in moving from direct practice to policy-level systems work, viewing this consultancy as an opportunity to expand his impact by working with different ecosystems and broadening his perspective on transformative education implementation.",

            "extracted_content": "Given all you know about me and my profile, make a profile of me and the kind of jobs you think would be great for me given i have a 2 year old baby and live in lile france have some financial instability am doing consulting in iraq traveling to iraq sometimes for the un through the itc have a lebanese nonprofit that does entrepreneurship training my masters in education doing a new masters this year on islam and psychology at the cambridge muslim college online and this job attached below, does it look good?\n\nScrutinized job fit, weighed personal circumstances and potential.\n11s\nLooking at your materials and situation, let me sketch out your professional profile and then give you some honest pushback on this UNESCO opportunity.\nYour Profile\nYou're essentially operating as a bridge-builder in fragmented landscapes—think of yourself as someone who works at the intersection of conflict zones, education innovation, and wellbeing research. Your superpower is creating learning frameworks that work in contexts where institutional structures are weak or broken. You've spent 15 years figuring out how to make entrepreneurship training, maker movements, and citizenship education actually function in places like Iraq, Lebanon, and refugee camps—not in theory, but in practice.\nYour trajectory shows someone who:\nThrives in complexity: You're comfortable with remote coordination, multicultural teams, crisis environments\nCreates systemic interventions: Not just programs, but assessment frameworks, curriculum design, network building\nDocuments and translates: You convert messy field experience into polished reports, proposals, and presentations\nJuggles multiple identities: Academic researcher + practitioner + nonprofit founder + consultant\nGiven your current constraints (2-year-old, Lille-based, financial instability, multiple commitments), you need work that is:\nRemote-first with flexible hours\nWell-compensated per day of actual work\nDiscrete projects with clear deliverables (not ongoing management)\nAligned with your expertise so you're not learning from scratch\nAbout This UNESCO Job\nThe Good:\nIt's genuinely aligned with your experience—you've literally done all these tasks before\nHome-based/remote is perfect for your situation\n50 days over 3.5 months gives you flexibility to manage other commitments\n$22,500 for 50 days is decent (though not exceptional for consultancy)\nBangkok timezone (UTC+7) is only 5-6 hours ahead of Lille—doable for meetings\nShort-term contract aligns with your need for discrete projects\nThe Concerning:\nThe deadline is TODAY (Oct 8, 2025). If you haven't submitted yet, you're likely too late\nThe timeline is aggressive—deliverable 1.1 due in 10 days if contract starts mid-October\nYou'd be juggling this with: ITC Iraq work (ends Oct 2025), Bloom operations, new Cambridge masters starting, and parenting a 2-year-old\n50 days of work compressed into 3.5 months = ~14 days/month = you'd be working 2-3 weeks per month on this alone\nBangkok working hours mean potential evening calls from Lille (3pm Bangkok = 10am Lille, not terrible, but 5pm Bangkok = noon Lille)\nHere's my actual pushback: Your application materials are strong, but your workplan timeline looks unrealistic. You have 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 all due within the first 2 weeks (15 days of deliverables in 12 calendar days). Either you:\nFront-load the work heavily (bad with a toddler)\nAssume you'll start working before the contract officially begins\nHaven't accounted for revision cycles\nAlso, at $450/day, this isn't cheap labor, but it's not premium consultancy rates either—you're in the mid-range. Given your expertise and the coordination complexity, you could arguably charge $600-750/day for similar work with private sector or foundations.\nBetter-Fit Job Archetypes for You\nBased on your profile, here's what would actually serve you well right now:\nEvaluation/research consultancies for INGO programs (remote, discrete, well-paid)\nCurriculum design sprints (2-4 week intensive projects you can plan around)\nStrategy facilitation for organizations working in your regions (Middle East, North Africa)\nAcademic research contracts that feed both your Cambridge studies and income\nPart-time remote roles with EdTech or impact-focused organizations (stable income, flexible hours)\nThe UNESCO job fits the mold, but the timing and intensity might stretch you thin. If you got this contract, you'd essentially be working full-time across ITC + UNESCO + Bloom + new masters + parenting through November.\nReal talk: If the deadline hasn't passed and you can submit today, go for it—but negotiate the timeline in your technical proposal. Push deliverable 1.3 to early November, or propose a more gradual ramp-up. And if you don't get it, don't sweat it—there will be other UN/INGO consultancies that fit your profile with better timing.\nDoes this line up with how you're thinking about it? And did you manage to submit before the deadline?\nITC Is done this week, so I'm more free,bloom is done. I need the work, what can I do to improve the application, particularly the work plan and what materials i want to submit\n\nStrategized workplan refinement and application enhancement tactics.\n14s\nAlright, let's fix this application. Since you need the work and have the bandwidth, here's what needs sharpening:\nCritical Issues with Your Current Workplan\nYour timeline treats the contract like a sprint when it should be a relay race. You've crammed 15 days of work into the first 12 calendar days, which signals either:\nYou don't understand the scope\nYou're desperate and overselling capacity\nYou haven't accounted for UNESCO review cycles\nThe real problem: UNESCO bureaucracy moves slowly. You'll submit draft 1.1, wait 3-5 days for feedback, revise, wait again. Your current plan has no buffer for this.\nRevised Workplan Strategy\nPropose an immediate start (upon contract signature, even if that's Oct 10-12). This shows urgency and gives you actual time to hit October deliverables. Restructure like this:\nREVISED TIMELINE (assuming Oct 12 start)\n\nPhase 1: Member-Led Webinars (Oct 12-25)\n- Days 1-2: Kick-off call + desk review of past GCED webinars\n- Days 3-5: Draft 1.1 (concept, agenda, comms) → submit Oct 16\n- Days 6-7: Incorporate feedback + finalize 1.1 → Oct 18\n- Days 8-10: Draft 1.2 (announcements + country docs) → submit Oct 21\n- Day 11: Revisions → finalize Oct 25\n\nPhase 2: Annual Meetings Prep (Oct 21-Nov 8)\nOVERLAP with Phase 1 for efficiency\n- Days 12-16: Draft 1.3 (concept notes, agenda, ROS, deck, comms) → submit Oct 30\n- Days 17-19: Revisions + finalize 1.3 → Nov 5\n- Milestone: Materials ready 1 month before Dec 5 meetings\n\nPhase 3: Post-Meeting Deliverables (Nov 10-30)\n- Days 20-22: Draft 2.1 (web articles) → submit Nov 14\n- Days 23-29: Draft 2.2 (Annual Report inputs) → submit Nov 24\n- Day 30: Revisions → finalize Nov 30\n\nPhase 4: Synthesis & Analysis (Dec 1-20)\n- Days 31-37: Draft 3.1 (PowerPoint) + 3.2 (thematic report) → submit Dec 12\n- Days 38-40: Revisions → finalize Dec 20\n\nPhase 5: 2026 Planning (Jan 5-Feb 20)\n- Days 41-50: Draft 4.1 & 4.2 (proposal + evaluation) → submit Feb 6\n- Days 51-53: Revisions → finalize Feb 20\nKey improvements:\nFront-loads October work but builds in review cycles\nShows you understand UNESCO moves slowly\nGives them materials well before the Dec 5 deadline (not last-minute)\nPhases 1-2 overlap intentionally (you're gathering intel for 1.3 while wrapping 1.1-1.2)\nWhat to Include in Your Materials Package\n1. Employment History Form (you have this)\nLooks complete, no changes needed\n2. Updated CV (you have this)\nIt's strong. Maybe add one line under ITC experience: \"Delivered final curriculum documentation suite October 2025, including trainer guides and implementation roadmap\"\n3. Cover Letter (needs tightening) Your current version is too long and buries the lede. Restructure:\nParagraph 1: \"I bring X years doing exactly these tasks\" (you have this)\nParagraph 2: Cut the Bloom/ITC description by 50%. They've seen your CV. Just write:\n\"At Bloom (2016-2024), I built assessment frameworks and produced 100+ reports for diverse stakeholders. At ITC (2024-2025), I delivered curriculum documentation for 50+ stakeholders in Iraq, including concept notes, trainer guides, and visual presentations—all meeting international editorial standards and tight deadlines.\"\nParagraph 3: Your bulleted list is good—keep it but make it punchier:\n\"For UNESCO Bangkok, I would deliver:\nWebinar packages: concepts, agendas, facilitation plans, announcement articles (≤250 words)\nAnnual meeting materials: slide decks, concept notes, run-of-show agendas highlighting GCED-NEQMAP synergies\nAnalytical reports: succinct inputs (≤7 pages) capturing insights, gender-responsive recommendations, and practical follow-up actions\n2026 workplan: evidence-based priorities aligned with the 2023 Recommendation on Education for Peace\"\nParagraph 4: Keep the logistics paragraph (English/Arabic, remote, timezone)\nParagraph 5: Close with availability—this is critical:\n\"My current ITC contract concludes October 11, 2025, making me immediately available to begin upon contract signature. I've attached my technical proposal with a revised workplan showing early delivery of October materials.\"\n4. Past Work Samples (you wrote \"Example(in hyperlink)\" but didn't provide any)\nThis is a major gap. You need 2-3 examples that mirror what they're asking for:\nMust include:\nA short article (250-500 words) you've written for a website or report\nA concept note or agenda for a workshop/meeting (2-3 pages)\nA PowerPoint deck or visual presentation\nWhere to find these:\nAny Bloom program documentation\nITC curriculum concept notes or workshop agendas\nArticles you've written for Nawaya, Medium, or other platforms\nIf you genuinely don't have shareable examples (confidentiality issues), create sanitized versions:\nTake an ITC concept note, remove sensitive details, rename it \"Sample Workshop Concept Note - Youth Entrepreneurship Program\"\nPull 3 slides from a deck and label it \"Sample Presentation Excerpt\"\nFormat: Create a simple doc that lists each sample with context:\nPAST WORK SAMPLES\n\n1. Workshop Concept Note – Design Thinking for Refugee Youth (2017)\n   [PDF link or attached]\n   Context: UNICEF-funded program reaching 150+ youth. I developed the conceptual framework, \n   agenda, and communications materials. This sample demonstrates experience with concept \n   development and stakeholder communications similar to deliverables 1.1 and 1.3.\n\n2. Article – \"Building Resilient Ventures in Crisis Contexts\" (2022)  \n   [Web link]\n   Context: 400-word article for Bloom's website highlighting program insights. Demonstrates \n   concise writing for web publication similar to deliverables 1.2 and 2.1.\n\n3. Program Report – Annual Impact Summary (2021)\n   [PDF link or attached - pages 3-8 only]\n   Context: Executive summary section of Bloom's annual report. Shows analytical writing, \n   data presentation, and recommendations format similar to deliverables 2.2 and 3.2.\n5. Technical Proposal (needs restructuring)\nYour current \"Approach & Methodology\" section is just a header with no content. Write 1.5-2 pages covering:\nSection A: Understanding of the Assignment (0.5 page) Paraphrase the ToR to show you get it:\n\"UNESCO Bangkok seeks to strengthen the Asia-Pacific GCED Network through high-quality knowledge products, communications materials, and strategic planning documents. The deliverables span four categories: (1) immediate webinar support, (2) annual meeting facilitation, (3) analytical synthesis, and (4) forward planning for 2026. Success requires balancing urgent October deadlines with substantive analysis of 2025 activities and GCED-NEQMAP synergies, all while maintaining gender-responsive and whole-school approach lenses.\"\nSection B: Methodology (1 page) Explain HOW you'll actually do this:\nPhase 1 - Discovery & Alignment Upon contract start, I will conduct desk review of 2024-2025 GCED Network materials and hold alignment calls with UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU to clarify priorities, gather templates, and confirm editorial preferences. This front-end investment ensures all deliverables match UNESCO's voice and the network's evolution.\nPhases 2-4 - Iterative Development\nEach deliverable follows a draft-review-finalize cycle, with submissions timed to allow 3-5 days for UNESCO feedback. For visual materials (decks, agendas), I'll provide wireframes for early direction-setting before full development. For written pieces, I'll share outlines first to align on structure and key messages.\nCross-Cutting Approaches\nGender lens: All materials will foreground examples of women and girls in GCED, use inclusive language, and highlight gender-disaggregated data where available\n21st century skills bridge: Explicit connections between GCED competencies and NEQMAP assessment frameworks in every deliverable\nEvidence-informed: Footnoted references to UNESCO publications, regional data, and network member experiences\nWhole-school approach: Materials will emphasize institutional integration beyond individual classrooms\nQuality Assurance All text deliverables will be copy-edited, referenced per UNESCO style guide, and delivered in both Word (for editing) and PDF formats. PowerPoint decks will include speaker notes. I will track all feedback in revision logs for transparency.\nSection C: Workplan & Timeline (0.5 page) Insert your revised table from above, preceded by 2 sentences:\n\"The workplan below assumes contract signature by October 12, enabling immediate start. It front-loads October deliverables while building in UNESCO review cycles, ensuring materials are ready well before the December 5 annual meetings.\"\n6. Financial Proposal\nYour fee table is fine, but add a note at the bottom:\nNotes:\n- Daily rate of $450 USD reflects mid-career consultancy benchmark for international \n  development education sector\n- Total fee covers all revisions and feedback incorporation (no additional charges)\n- Proposed lump sum contract: $22,500 USD payable in three installments \n  (33% upon contract signature, 33% upon delivery of Phase 3, 34% upon final acceptance)\n- If official travel required, DSA and economy airfare to be covered separately per UNESCO rules\nOne More Thing: The Submission\nThe job post says to submit through the online portal, uploading everything as ONE Word document:\n\"Before uploading the completed form, please add the following documents as extra pages at the end of the Word file\"\nSo your final submission is:\nEmployment History Form (pages 1-X)\nCV (pages X+1 to Y)\nCover Letter (pages Y+1 to Z)\nPast Work Samples list with links or excerpts (pages Z+1 to...)\nTechnical Proposal (approach, methodology, workplan)\nFinancial Proposal (fee table + notes)\nAll in one Word doc. Add page numbers and a table of contents if it's over 15 pages.\nThe deadline is today. If you're going to do this, you need to:\nSpend next 2-3 hours finding/creating work samples\nRewrite cover letter (30 min)\nWrite technical proposal methodology section (1 hour)\nRevise workplan table (30 min)\nCompile everything into one doc (30 min)\nSubmit by 11:59pm Paris time\nDoable? Or do you need to triage and just get something submitted even if imperfect?"

I have what I need. Let me draft both proposals for you. I'll create them as professional, ready-to-submit documents.\n\n---\n\n## **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL**\n\n### A. Understanding of the Assignment\n\nUNESCO Bangkok seeks a consultant to strengthen the Asia-Pacific Global Citizenship Education (GCED) Network through the production of strategic communications materials, analytical reports, and planning documents across four work phases. The assignment requires balancing urgent October deliverables (webinar packages, annual meeting materials) with substantive analytical synthesis (2025 program reviews) and forward-looking strategic planning (2026 workplan). Success depends on producing concise, gender-responsive materials that bridge GCED competencies with NEQMAP assessment frameworks, maintain UNESCO's editorial standards, and support the network's evolution toward systemic, whole-school approaches.\n\nThe consultant must demonstrate facility with multiple formats—from 250-word web articles to comprehensive thematic reports—while working remotely with APCEIU and UNESCO Bangkok stakeholders across time zones. The 50-day timeline compressed into 3.5 months requires strategic sequencing to allow UNESCO review cycles while meeting the critical December 5th annual meeting deadline.\n\n### B. Methodology & Approach\n\n**Phase 1: Discovery & Alignment (Days 1-2)**\n\nUpon contract signature, I will conduct a rapid desk review of 2024-2025 GCED Network documentation, including past webinar materials, member communications, and relevant UNESCO publications. Concurrently, I'll hold alignment calls with UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU to clarify editorial preferences, confirm priority messaging, and gather existing templates. This upfront investment ensures all deliverables reflect UNESCO's voice and the network's strategic direction.\n\n**Phase 2: Iterative Development Across All Deliverables**\n\nEach deliverable follows a **draft-review-finalize cycle** with submissions timed to allow 3-5 working days for UNESCO feedback before finalization. This accounts for internal coordination within UNESCO Bangkok and between regional offices.\n\nFor visual materials (PowerPoint decks, meeting agendas, run-of-show documents), I will provide wireframes or outlines for early direction-setting before full development. For written pieces (articles, reports, concept notes), I will share structural outlines first to align on key messages, tone, and analytical depth.\n\n**Cross-Cutting Methodological Commitments:**\n\n1. **Gender-Responsive Lens**: All materials will foreground examples of women and girls in GCED programming, use inclusive language, and highlight gender-disaggregated data where available. Recommendations will explicitly address how proposed activities promote gender equity in education systems.\n\n2. **GCED-NEQMAP Synergy**: Every deliverable will make explicit connections between Global Citizenship Education competencies and NEQMAP's assessment frameworks, showing how values-based education and learning assessment can mutually reinforce quality education goals.\n\n3. **Evidence-Informed Content**: All analytical sections will be footnoted with references to UNESCO publications, regional education data, and documented network member experiences. Claims will be substantiated; recommendations will be grounded in precedent or research.\n\n4. **Whole-School Approach**: Materials will emphasize institutional integration of GCED beyond individual classrooms—addressing curriculum, pedagogy, school culture, community partnerships, and assessment practices as interconnected elements.\n\n5. **Concision & Clarity**: Understanding that network members span multiple countries with varying English proficiency, I will prioritize clear, jargon-free language. Articles will stay well under word limits; reports will use headers, bullet points, and visual breaks for scannability.\n\n**Phase 3: Quality Assurance & Delivery**\n\nAll text deliverables will be copy-edited for grammar, consistency, and UNESCO style guide compliance before submission. I will deliver materials in both editable formats (Word for text, PowerPoint with speaker notes) and PDFs for final distribution. A revision log will track all feedback incorporation for transparency.\n\n### C. Timeline & Workplan\n\n*Assumes contract signature by October 15, 2025, enabling immediate start on October 20, 2025.*\n\n| **Phase** | **Days** | **Key Deliverables** | **Timeline** |\n|-----------|----------|---------------------|--------------|\n| **Phase 1: Member-Led Webinars** | 11 days | | **Oct 20 - Nov 1** |\n| Kick-off & desk review | 2 | Alignment call with UNESCO/APCEIU; review past materials | Oct 20-21 |\n| Draft 1.1 | 3 | Concept, agenda, facilitation plan, comms template | Oct 22-24 |\n| Review & finalize 1.1 | 1 | Incorporate feedback | Oct 28 |\n| Draft 1.2 | 3 | Announcement article + country documentation | Oct 29-31 |\n| Finalize 1.2 | 2 | Revisions & submission | Nov 1 |\n| **Phase 2: Annual Meetings Preparation** | 19 days | | **Oct 25 - Nov 15** |\n| Draft 1.3 (overlap with Phase 1) | 5 | Concept notes, agenda, ROS, deck, comms | Oct 25-31 |\n| Review 1.3 | 5 | UNESCO feedback cycle | Nov 3-7 |\n| Finalize 1.3 | 3 | Revisions & submission | Nov 10-12 |\n| Buffer for final adjustments | 6 | Pre-meeting revisions if needed | Nov 13-15 |\n| **MILESTONE** | | All materials ready 3 weeks before Dec 5 meetings | Nov 15 |\n| **Phase 3: Post-Meeting Deliverables** | 10 days | | **Dec 9-23** |\n| Draft 2.1 | 3 | 3 web articles (250 words each) | Dec 9-11 |\n| Finalize 2.1 | 2 | Incorporate feedback | Dec 12-13 |\n| Draft 2.2 | 3 | Annual Report inputs (≤7 pages) | Dec 16-18 |\n| Finalize 2.2 | 2 | Revisions & submission | Dec 19-20 |\n| **Phase 4: Synthesis & Analysis** | 10 days | | **Jan 5-20** |\n| Draft 3.1 & 3.2 | 7 | PowerPoint + thematic report | Jan 5-13 |\n| Finalize 3.1 & 3.2 | 3 | Incorporate feedback | Jan 14-16 |\n| **TOTAL: Phases 1-4** | **50 days** | | **Oct 20 - Jan 16** |\n\n**Note on Flexibility**: While the table shows discrete phases, I maintain capacity to accommodate urgent requests (e.g., if UNESCO Bangkok needs rapid-turnaround edits for the December meetings or requires additional communications materials not specified in the ToR).\n\n---\n\n## **FINANCIAL PROPOSAL**\n\n### Fee Structure\n\n| **Item** | **Unit** | **Rate (USD)** | **Total (USD)** |\n|----------|----------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Professional consultancy services | 50 working days | $500/day | **$25,000** |\n| **TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE** | | | **$25,000** |\n\n### Payment Terms\n\nPayment structured in three installments tied to deliverable completion:\n\n- **First Installment (40%)**: $10,000 upon contract signature\n- **Second Installment (30%)**: $7,500 upon UNESCO acceptance of Phase 3 deliverables (Deliverables 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2)\n- **Final Installment (30%)**: $7,500 upon UNESCO acceptance of Phase 4 deliverables (Deliverables 3.1, 3.2)\n\n### Notes on Fee\n\n1. **Market Positioning**: The proposed daily rate of $500 USD reflects mid-to-senior consultancy benchmarks for international development education specialists with 15+ years of experience. It accounts for the complexity of synthesizing network-wide insights, producing multiple deliverable formats, and working across UNESCO's editorial and coordination structures.\n\n2. **Inclusive of Revisions**: The total fee covers all reasonable revisions and feedback incorporation cycles (up to two rounds of revisions per deliverable). Additional revisions beyond this scope would be negotiated separately.\n\n3. **Home-Based Work**: All work will be conducted remotely from Lille, France. No travel is anticipated for this assignment. Should UNESCO request in-person participation (e.g., December annual meetings in Bangkok), travel costs would be covered separately per UNESCO rules (DSA + economy airfare).\n\n4. **Flexible Negotiation**: While I've proposed a rate of $500/day based on comparable consultancy rates, I am open to discussing adjustments to align with UNESCO Bangkok's budget parameters while maintaining the scope and quality of deliverables.\n\n---\n\n## **PAST WORK SAMPLES**\n\nTo demonstrate relevant experience, I am providing the following work samples that mirror the deliverables required for this consultancy:\n\n### 1. **Program Management Guide – Bloom Accelerator Framework (2023)**\n*Format: 41-page comprehensive guide including facilitation methods, program design principles, and assessment frameworks*\n\n**Relevance to UNESCO Assignment**: \nThis document demonstrates my ability to create structured, pedagogically-sound program documentation similar to Deliverables 1.1 (webinar concept/agenda) and 1.3 (annual meeting materials).

We\r\ncreated it to help accelerators and program managers focus on impact and inclusive\r\nentrepreneurship in developing/emerging ecosystems through skill-based and\r\ncharacter-based support.\r\nHow to use this step-by-step guide?\r\nRunning accelerator programs is a young and evolving field. With limited proven\r\nresearch into best practices, we do not wish to claim a set formula or one-size-fits-all\r\napproach. Accelerator models vary significantly depending on their objectives.\r\nInstead, the guide aims to help program managers understand some of the critical\r\nchoices and challenges they'll need to consider if they're considering building a\r\nprogram of their own. It combines lessons from previous practices and patterns we\r\nidentified over the years to highlight and frame the strategic choices facing\r\nstakeholders interested in creating and running these programs.\r\nWe developed this guide into two sections:\r\n● Section 1: The Bloom Framework 🌻\r\nThis section will help you understand our framework and assessment suite.\r\n● Section 2: Running an Accelerator Program 🌟\r\nThis section covers the critical aspects of creating and running an accelerator in six\r\nsimple stages. Each stage comes with a series of toolkits to help you think about your\r\nplans and the context of accelerator design.\r\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 1 of 41",

It focuses on two core pillars:\r\n1. The Individual: Featuring Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH), Universal\r\nSkills, Character Strengths, and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\r\nAssessments.\r\n2. The Organization: Featuring the Organizational Development Assessment.\r\nThe framework helps assess core strengths and weaknesses, prioritizing areas for\r\nlearning and development. Our goal is to simplify the creation of custom learning\r\njourneys, enabling teams and program managers to identify optimal learning\r\nopportunities, foster a supportive environment, and positively impact businesses.\r\nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement\r\nacross both pillars, ensuring simultaneous development and, for example, improving an\r\nindividual's skill through activities that address core organizational needs.\r\nEntrepreneurs identify their priority development areas based on assessment results\r\nand customize their learning journey with program managers, co-creating a tailored\r\ncurriculum for the cohort.\r\nOur framework is based on proven cohort-based and project-based learning methods\r\ncombined with the power of mentorship. Peer learning enhances the experience, while\r\nproject-based learning aligns objectives with a mission or vision, fostering intrinsic\r\nmotivation. Using a flipped classroom approach, entrepreneurs first digest relevant\r\ncontent, reflect on their learnings, and apply them in their enterprises. They then meet\r\nwith their cohort for peer feedback and mentorship, using what they learn in real-life\r\nsettings.\r\nOur programs nurture individual and organizational development, promoting\r\ncooperation over competition and leveraging collective intelligence to solve pressing\r\nsocietal problems.\r\nThe Bloom Training Framework is versatile and can be used in various contexts,\r\nincluding companies, educational programs (youth, school, university), startup\r\naccelerators, and short events like startup sprints or hackathons.\r\nOur Principles\r\nWe use the following guiding principles to evaluate and prioritize program activities:\r\n1. Keep entrepreneurs/learners in the driver's seat. (Upside down pyramid) \\/\r\nOur goal is to unleash the potential within the teams in our programs to help them do\r\nthe right thing at the right time, saving time by not spending it on extraneous,\r\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 2 of 41",

A well-planned and well-facilitated event can have\r\nmore engagement and impact than a poorly planned or facilitated event.\r\nCreate Bridges Between the Physical and the Virtual\r\n● Play games and pass items back and forth between screens\r\n● Share tea, coffee, or a meal while on a call\r\n● Make a gift box of friendly perks/treats/tools to help them in the accelerator, and\r\nthings to do fun games/activities with:\r\n○ Inspirational items (posters, notebooks, magnets, etc.)\r\n○ Shirts, hats, or something to wear\r\n○ Clown noses or fun items (in wrapping that disguises what they are until\r\nuse)\r\n○ Tools for activities, such as printouts of frameworks, post-its, pens, activity\r\ncards, etc.\r\n○ Stretching exercises, especially after having been at the laptop for more\r\nthan half an hour.\r\n○ Sharing music: In each session, let a participant choose the session’s\r\nbackground music\r\n○ Whiteboard: share the whiteboard before the session begins and ask each\r\nparticipant to share a motivational quote/message.\r\nSimple Tips for Increasing Engagement Online\r\n● Eye contact: Look at the camera (not the screen) when talking, especially when\r\nrecording something\r\n● The background: Something nice?

Curriculums are customized according to teams’ Enterprise Capacities results,\r\nOrganization Development Plan, surveys, and one-on-one interviews to identify\r\nthe most present needs\r\n2. Content is created well before training sessions so entrepreneurs can learn at\r\ntheir own pace, apply their learning on homework, templates, and tools, and get\r\nfeedback in sessions with the trainers.\r\nDIAGNOSTIC & TOOLKIT: (assessments, checklists, models, templates)\r\n● Program Planning Template v2\r\n● Bloom Digital Library\r\nStage 4: Accelerator\r\nBloom Accelerator Programs Principles\r\nBelow are the five principles that guide the design of our accelerator programs.\r\nPraxis: learning happens by doing and reflecting.\r\nPraxis is the process by which a skill is embodied or realized. \"Praxis\" refers to engaging,\r\napplying, exercising, learning, or practicing ideas. Praxis is critical thinking that\r\ncombines reflection and action.\r\nBloom tools: In our programs, this is applied by encouraging enterprises to record their\r\ndaily tasks and activities on the Bloom task board.\r\nStrengths Oriented: use momentum and do more of what’s working.\r\nThe strength-based approach focuses on the positive attributes of a person or a group\r\nrather than the negative ones. This approach builds on the entrepreneurs’ strengths,\r\nspecifically seeing them as resourceful and resilient when in adverse conditions.\r\nStrengths are integral to our human identity, constituting the intrinsic and inherent\r\nqualities that define us as individuals. However, few are conscious and appreciative of\r\nthem or particular about how we can best put them to use to achieve desired\r\noutcomes.\r\nUsing strengths energizes and motivates individuals to contribute discretionary effort\r\ntowards attaining their goals. At the same time, it nourishes a feeling of achievement\r\nbecause they perform the things they are best at doing. Research indicates that when\r\nindividuals use their strengths, they feel happier, more confident and proud, and more\r\nengaged at work. In addition, they perform better while experiencing a sense of\r\nresilience in achieving their goals.\r\nBloom tools: In our programs, we apply this by administering personal assessments to\r\nidentify entrepreneurs’ strengths and capitalize on them through our library of\r\nactivities that help build the strengths. Additionally, we developed the Enterprise\r\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 26 of 41",

Once we set the common needs, we reach out to the teams with\r\nindividual needs to help them identify training activities they can do at their own pace\r\nand get feedback from mentors and trainers individually.\r\nLearning by Doing\r\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is nothing more important than “doing” and\r\n“testing” to understand the product, customers, and business model. At Bloom, we\r\nknow how much theory we introduce to entrepreneurs versus how much time we give\r\nthem to achieve results. Teaching entrepreneurs theory is inevitable — it is crucial to\r\nunderstand the context — but we make sure that every idea comes with a framework\r\nor a tool that entrepreneurs can use and develop over time to achieve their goals. These\r\ntools make robust theories actionable. Once we introduce them to our program, we\r\nmake an effort to revisit them during the program over and over again, in the best spirit\r\nof lean startup methodology, so we make sure we are helping the startups drive\r\nprogress and results.\r\nModular Learning\r\nModular learning, as the word connotes, uses learning modules that facilitate\r\nentrepreneurs learning by themselves. It is a form of distance learning that uses\r\nSelf-Learning Modules based on the essential learning competencies developed by the\r\ntrainers with the aid of the program and training manager.\r\nWhen there’s teaching, it’s tempting to sit students down in a classroom and show\r\nthem what they need to know. But GALI found that “the more remote work we allow,\r\nthe better.” For example, indirect learning, which focuses on the student’s inquiry and\r\nexploration rather than the teacher’s instruction, allows entrepreneurs to learn while\r\nworking on their business plans and product.\r\nAccelerators should design curricula around things entrepreneurs do remotely that\r\nserve the dual function of teaching valuable lessons and helping advance the startup. It\r\nis better to use the time to build relationships and get feedback. Online education with\r\ne-learning modules allows founders to spend more time building networks and\r\nproducts.\r\nOnce the teams complete the training activity, we invite them to share their work in the\r\ncommunity to get feedback from their peers and program managers. They will then\r\njoin an online training session to get further feedback from their peers and expert\r\ntrainers.\r\nKEY POINTS:\r\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 25 of 41",

As yet, an agreed framework for\r\nmeasuring the performance of an accelerator program does not exist, but standard\r\nmetrics collected and published so far include the following:\r\n● Number of applications to programs\r\n● Number of enterprises supported\r\n● Follow-on investment raised by enterprises\r\n● The survival rate of enterprises\r\n● Number of employees of enterprises\r\n● NPS of the program\r\nWe believe that we should pay more attention to defining performance and metrics for\r\nsuccess. Unfortunately, as startups, accelerators often lack the time and resources for\r\nsuch measurements, so the impact of accelerator methods is difficult to judge with\r\nlimited data available.\r\nHere are some metrics we recommend you track:\r\n1. Monthly: For each program, data is collected monthly depending on the KPIs\r\nthe program manager sets. This could include items such as\r\na. Pre and post-assessment results\r\nb. Organization Development Plan progress and status update for each\r\nactivity\r\nc. Revenues\r\nd. Expenses\r\ne. Traction (most relevant metric per enterprise)\r\nf. Feedback on this month’s accelerator activities\r\ni. Engagement\r\nii. Learning\r\niii. Inspiration\r\niv. Complexity\r\nv. Relevance\r\n2. Post-Program: Program managers should collect the following data quarterly\r\npost-accelerator.\r\na. KPIs\r\ni. Finance\r\n1. Revenue\r\n2. Expenses\r\n3. Burn rate & runway.\r\n4.

Achievement: Measures the accomplishment of goals and the sense of mastery,\r\nhighlighting the importance of setting and achieving personal and professional\r\nobjectives.\r\n6. Health: Assesses physical wellbeing, acknowledging that a healthy body is\r\nessential for overall life satisfaction.\r\nUsing the PERMAH framework, we ensure our programs focus on professional success\r\nand personal flourishing. This approach helps individuals and organizations achieve\r\nsustainable success by aligning personal wellbeing with organizational goals.\r\n1.2. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\r\nThe Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessment evaluates proficiency in\r\nrecognizing opportunities, mobilizing resources, and taking effective action in various\r\ncontexts. This assessment is based on the EntreComp framework, a comprehensive tool\r\ndeveloped by the European Commission to promote entrepreneurship education and\r\ntraining. EntreComp offers a common reference framework that defines the key\r\ncompetencies necessary for entrepreneurial behavior and mindset.\r\nWe use the EntrepComp framework to help people build skills along six dimensions:\r\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 4 of 41",

Gratitude is interesting due to the fact that it has\r\nhigh correlation with wellbeing and life satisfaction while it was one of the traits that\r\nthe program has room to improve on. Hope and Persistence have been demonstrated\r\nto be malleable Character Strengths (Gander 2019) and also have high correlations with\r\nEntrepreneurial Success (Worell 2011) as well as Life Satisfaction (Park, N., Peterson, C., &\r\nSeligman 2004) and Wellbeing (Gander 2019). We hypothesize the combination of the\r\nmalleability of the trait along with correlations with factors that can support\r\nentrepreneurs make these traits good candidates for strengthening over the course of\r\na program.\r\nPractical Program Applications of our Hypotheses\r\nA key objective of our programmatic approach in Bloom is to combine these critical\r\naspects of character and universal skills development into our entrepreneurial support\r\nprograms, since success of social impact and traditional enterprises is intimately\r\nconnected to the capacities of the team, especially founding and early team, of an\r\nenterprise. The more effective programs can be on both enterprise and personal\r\ndevelopment factors, the more impactful the programs can be both in the short-term\r\nand long-term. This is even more critical in emerging ecosystems and\r\nmarginalized/vulnerable communities where character and skill development\r\nopportunities are less available, and where exposure to acute and sustained traumatic\r\nexperiences are more common.\r\nFurther Exploration\r\nFurther exploration will be how to deepen the factors supporting these traits and\r\nengender post-traumatic growth for an age of instability and chaos. Some of the factors\r\nthat are correlated with increased potential for Post Traumatic Growth are Social\r\nSupport as well as Deliberate Rumination (Morris, B.

These dimensions are essential indicators of a well-lived life, each\r\ncontributing uniquely to an individual's overall sense of wellbeing.\r\n1. Positivity: Measures the extent to which an individual experiences positive\r\nemotions, crucial for enhancing resilience and overall mental health.\r\n2. Engagement: Assesses the level of involvement and absorption in activities,\r\nreflecting a flow state where individuals are fully immersed and find deep\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n3. Relationships: Evaluates the quality of an individual's connections with others,\r\nrecognizing that supportive and fulfilling relationships are fundamental to\r\nwellbeing.\r\n4. Meaning: Gauges the sense of purpose and direction in life, indicating how\r\nmuch individuals feel their lives have significance and contribute to something\r\ngreater.\r\n5. Achievement: Measures the accomplishment of goals and the sense of mastery,\r\nhighlighting the importance of setting and achieving personal and professional\r\nobjectives.\r\n6. Health: Assesses physical wellbeing, acknowledging that a healthy body is\r\nessential for overall life satisfaction.\r\nUsing the PERMAH framework, we ensure our programs focus on professional success\r\nand personal flourishing. This approach helps individuals and organizations achieve\r\nsustainable success by aligning personal wellbeing with organizational goals.\r\n1.2. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\r\nThe Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills Assessment evaluates proficiency in\r\nrecognizing opportunities, mobilizing resources, and taking effective action in various\r\ncontexts. This assessment is based on the EntreComp framework, a comprehensive tool\r\ndeveloped by the European Commission to promote entrepreneurship education and\r\ntraining. EntreComp offers a common reference framework that defines the key\r\ncompetencies necessary for entrepreneurial behavior and mindset.\r\nWe use the EntrepComp framework to help people build skills along six dimensions:\r\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 4 of 41",

We can help people develop skills of\r\neffectiveness by creating an enabling environment.\r\n2. Transformation > Information. Make available knowledge actionable. (Library\r\ncontent)\r\nPrioritizing transformative learning experiences over mere information dissemination\r\nensures that knowledge is applied in meaningful ways. By providing actionable insights\r\nand practical tools, we create an environment where learning translates into real-world\r\nimpact.\r\n3. Get the right people in the right seats on the bus. (Team assessments)\r\nOptimizing team composition by aligning individual strengths and roles enhances\r\noverall team effectiveness. Through comprehensive assessments, we identify key areas\r\nfor personal and professional growth, enabling targeted interventions that maximize\r\nindividual and collective potential.\r\nWhy integrate individual growth in an accelerator? The effectiveness of a team is\r\ndetermined by the development of each individual who comprises it. So, while personal\r\ndevelopment and well-being are also an end, we ensure that the teams are more\r\nrobust and the organization is more likely to keep going. Instilling such resilience helps\r\ncultivate values-driven people and a community of social change makers with a growth\r\nmindset and a contributor attitude.\r\n4. Create an enabling environment in the program and support the broader\r\necosystem.\r\nFostering a supportive community within cohort-based programs is essential for\r\ncreating an enabling environment where entrepreneurs can thrive. By nurturing a\r\nculture of collaboration and mutual support, we enhance the learning experience and\r\ncontribute to the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem. We win when we win together.\r\nPillar 1: The Individual\r\nBloom recommends the following individual development assessments:\r\n1. Add in in new flourishing frameworks\r\n2. Wellbeing & Engagement: at work & in life (through PERMAH)\r\n3. Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of\r\nentrepreneurship and leadership\r\n4. Character Strengths: through VIA, Values in Action\r\n5. Universal Skills: Skills relevant for all aspects of work and life)\r\n1.1.

Understanding of the Assignment\n\nUNESCO Bangkok seeks a consultant to strengthen the Asia-Pacific Global Citizenship Education (GCED) Network through the production of strategic communications materials, analytical reports, and planning documents across four work phases. The assignment requires balancing urgent October deliverables (webinar packages, annual meeting materials) with substantive analytical synthesis (2025 program reviews) and forward-looking strategic planning (2026 workplan). Success depends on producing concise, gender-responsive materials that bridge GCED competencies with NEQMAP assessment frameworks, maintain UNESCO's editorial standards, and support the network's evolution toward systemic, whole-school approaches.\n\nThe consultant must demonstrate facility with multiple formats—from 250-word web articles to comprehensive thematic reports—while working remotely with APCEIU and UNESCO Bangkok stakeholders across time zones. The 50-day timeline compressed into 3.5 months requires strategic sequencing to allow UNESCO review cycles while meeting the critical December 5th annual meeting deadline.\n\n### B. Methodology & Approach\n\n**Phase 1: Discovery & Alignment (Days 1-2)**\n\nUpon contract signature, I will conduct a rapid desk review of 2024-2025 GCED Network documentation, including past webinar materials, member communications, and relevant UNESCO publications. Concurrently, I'll hold alignment calls with UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU to clarify editorial preferences, confirm priority messaging, and gather existing templates. This upfront investment ensures all deliverables reflect UNESCO's voice and the network's strategic direction.\n\n**Phase 2: Iterative Development Across All Deliverables**\n\nEach deliverable follows a **draft-review-finalize cycle** with submissions timed to allow 3-5 working days for UNESCO feedback before finalization. This accounts for internal coordination within UNESCO Bangkok and between regional offices.\n\nFor visual materials (PowerPoint decks, meeting agendas, run-of-show documents), I will provide wireframes or outlines for early direction-setting before full development. For written pieces (articles, reports, concept notes), I will share structural outlines first to align on key messages, tone, and analytical depth.\n\n**Cross-Cutting Methodological Commitments:**\n\n1. **Gender-Responsive Lens**: All materials will foreground examples of women and girls in GCED programming, use inclusive language, and highlight gender-disaggregated data where available. Recommendations will explicitly address how proposed activities promote gender equity in education systems.\n\n2. **GCED-NEQMAP Synergy**: Every deliverable will make explicit connections between Global Citizenship Education competencies and NEQMAP's assessment frameworks, showing how values-based education and learning assessment can mutually reinforce quality education goals.\n\n3. **Evidence-Informed Content**: All analytical sections will be footnoted with references to UNESCO publications, regional education data, and documented network member experiences. Claims will be substantiated; recommendations will be grounded in precedent or research.\n\n4. **Whole-School Approach**: Materials will emphasize institutional integration of GCED beyond individual classrooms—addressing curriculum, pedagogy, school culture, community partnerships, and assessment practices as interconnected elements.\n\n5. **Concision & Clarity**: Understanding that network members span multiple countries with varying English proficiency, I will prioritize clear, jargon-free language. Articles will stay well under word limits; reports will use headers, bullet points, and visual breaks for scannability.\n\n**Phase 3: Quality Assurance & Delivery**\n\nAll text deliverables will be copy-edited for grammar, consistency, and UNESCO style guide compliance before submission. I will deliver materials in both editable formats (Word for text, PowerPoint with speaker notes) and PDFs for final distribution. A revision log will track all feedback incorporation for transparency.\n\n### C. Timeline & Workplan\n\n*Assumes contract signature by October 15, 2025, enabling immediate start on October 20, 2025.*\n\n| **Phase** | **Days** | **Key Deliverables** | **Timeline** |\n|-----------|----------|---------------------|--------------|\n| **Phase 1: Member-Led Webinars** | 11 days | | **Oct 20 - Nov 1** |\n| Kick-off & desk review | 2 | Alignment call with UNESCO/APCEIU; review past materials | Oct 20-21 |\n| Draft 1.1 | 3 | Concept, agenda, facilitation plan, comms template | Oct 22-24 |\n| Review & finalize 1.1 | 1 | Incorporate feedback | Oct 28 |\n| Draft 1.2 | 3 | Announcement article + country documentation | Oct 29-31 |\n| Finalize 1.2 | 2 | Revisions & submission | Nov 1 |\n| **Phase 2: Annual Meetings Preparation** | 19 days | | **Oct 25 - Nov 15** |\n| Draft 1.3 (overlap with Phase 1) | 5 | Concept notes, agenda, ROS, deck, comms | Oct 25-31 |\n| Review 1.3 | 5 | UNESCO feedback cycle | Nov 3-7 |\n| Finalize 1.3 | 3 | Revisions & submission | Nov 10-12 |\n| Buffer for final adjustments | 6 | Pre-meeting revisions if needed | Nov 13-15 |\n| **MILESTONE** | | All materials ready 3 weeks before Dec 5 meetings | Nov 15 |\n| **Phase 3: Post-Meeting Deliverables** | 10 days | | **Dec 9-23** |\n| Draft 2.1 | 3 | 3 web articles (250 words each) | Dec 9-11 |\n| Finalize 2.1 | 2 | Incorporate feedback | Dec 12-13 |\n| Draft 2.2 | 3 | Annual Report inputs (≤7 pages) | Dec 16-18 |\n| Finalize 2.2 | 2 | Revisions & submission | Dec 19-20 |\n| **Phase 4: Synthesis & Analysis** | 10 days | | **Jan 5-20** |\n| Draft 3.1 & 3.2 | 7 | PowerPoint + thematic report | Jan 5-13 |\n| Finalize 3.1 & 3.2 | 3 | Incorporate feedback | Jan 14-16 |\n| **TOTAL: Phases 1-4** | **50 days** | | **Oct 20 - Jan 16** |\n\n**Note on Flexibility**: While the table shows discrete phases, I maintain capacity to accommodate urgent requests (e.g., if UNESCO Bangkok needs rapid-turnaround edits for the December meetings or requires additional communications materials not specified in the ToR).\n\n---\n\n## **FINANCIAL PROPOSAL**\n\n### Fee Structure\n\n| **Item** | **Unit** | **Rate (USD)** | **Total (USD)** |\n|----------|----------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Professional consultancy services | 50 working days | $500/day | **$25,000** |\n| **TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE** | | | **$25,000** |\n\n### Payment Terms\n\nPayment structured in three installments tied to deliverable completion:\n\n- **First Installment (40%)**: $10,000 upon contract signature\n- **Second Installment (30%)**: $7,500 upon UNESCO acceptance of Phase 3 deliverables (Deliverables 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2)\n- **Final Installment (30%)**: $7,500 upon UNESCO acceptance of Phase 4 deliverables (Deliverables 3.1, 3.2)\n\n### Notes on Fee\n\n1. **Market Positioning**: The proposed daily rate of $500 USD reflects mid-to-senior consultancy benchmarks for international development education specialists with 15+ years of experience. It accounts for the complexity of synthesizing network-wide insights, producing multiple deliverable formats, and working across UNESCO's editorial and coordination structures.\n\n2. **Inclusive of Revisions**: The total fee covers all reasonable revisions and feedback incorporation cycles (up to two rounds of revisions per deliverable). Additional revisions beyond this scope would be negotiated separately.\n\n3. **Home-Based Work**: All work will be conducted remotely from Lille, France. No travel is anticipated for this assignment. Should UNESCO request in-person participation (e.g., December annual meetings in Bangkok), travel costs would be covered separately per UNESCO rules (DSA + economy airfare).\n\n4. **Flexible Negotiation**: While I've proposed a rate of $500/day based on comparable consultancy rates, I am open to discussing adjustments to align with UNESCO Bangkok's budget parameters while maintaining the scope and quality of deliverables.\n\n---\n\n## **PAST WORK SAMPLES**\n\nTo demonstrate relevant experience, I am providing the following work samples that mirror the deliverables required for this consultancy:\n\n### 1. **Program Management Guide – Bloom Accelerator Framework (2023)**\n*Format: 41-page comprehensive guide including facilitation methods, program design principles, and assessment frameworks*\n\n**Relevance to UNESCO Assignment**: \nThis document demonstrates my ability to create structured, pedagogically-sound program documentation similar to Deliverables 1.1 (webinar concept/agenda) and 1.3 (annual meeting materials).

I am based in Lille with stable childcare support, and I can provide **Bangkok overlap from 11:00–15:00 ICT** on key days, with email responsiveness outside those hours.\n\nI am confident my blend of **research-to-practice expertise**, **UN consultancy familiarity**, and **wellbeing-centered pedagogy** will deliver both quality and timeliness for UNESCO Bangkok. I have attached my Employment History Form, CV, selected samples (article, program guide excerpt, research report), and the technical and financial proposals. I would be honored to support UNESCO and APCEIU in advancing transformative education across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n**Warm regards,**\nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\n# 📄 Technical Proposal (Approach & Methodology)\n\n### 1. Understanding of the Assignment\n\nUNESCO Bangkok seeks a consultant to produce **GCED knowledge products and communications**—from webinar packages and annual meeting materials to short web articles, thematic briefs, and a 2026 proposal package. The assignment requires **fast-turnaround deliverables** that are both **analytical and communication-ready**, aligned with the **2023 Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights, and Sustainable Development**.\n\nThe work must:\n\n* Be **concise, clear, and in UNESCO editorial style**.\n* Highlight **gender and inclusion**.\n* Strengthen **GCED–NEQMAP synergies** on 21st-century skills.\n* Include **feedback loops** with UNESCO/APCEIU to ensure quality and uptake.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Methodological Principles\n\nFrom Bloom’s program design and my postgraduate research, I will apply:\n\n* **Upside-down pyramid facilitation**: put practitioners at the center, with scaffolding rather than prescriptive teaching. \n* **Community check-ins**: embed reflective, collective practices that build belonging and keep GCED people-centered. \n* **Strengths-based assessment**: focus on amplifying what’s working, rather than deficit correction.\n* **Mutual learning**: elevate case stories across countries to enable cross-pollination.\n* **AI-augmented thinking**: use LLMs as structured brainstorming and outlining tools—never as replacements—ensuring human authorship, coherence, and UNESCO style. \n\n---\n\n### 3. Workflow\n\n**Phase A — Discovery & Kickoff (Oct 20–24)**\n\n* Desk review of 2024–25 GCED/NEQMAP docs, APCEIU materials.\n* Alignment call with UNESCO/APCEIU.\n* Build a micro-style kit (formatting, tone, image rules).\n\n**Phase B — October Deliverables (Oct 25–Nov 11)**\n\n* Webinar concept/agenda/comms (1.1).\n* Short announcements + country docs (1.2).\n* Annual meeting packages: concept notes, ROS, decks, comms (1.3).\n\n**Phase C — November Deliverables (Nov 14–29)**\n\n* Web articles + follow-up actions (2.1).\n* Annual report inputs (2.2).\n\n**Phase D — December Deliverables (Dec 9–20)**\n\n* Consolidated PPT (3.1).\n* Thematic brief (3.2).\n\n**Phase E — January–February Deliverables (Jan 23–Feb 20)**\n\n* 2026 proposal package (4.1).\n* Evaluation report of 2025 activities (4.2).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Cross-Cutting Lenses\n\n* **Gender & inclusion:** Demonstrate with data and case examples (e.g., Bloom’s women-only program *HerMeNow*, 50%+ female participation across remote-first training).\n* **Whole-institution approach:** Highlight policy, teacher, and community alignment.\n* **Monitoring & assessment:** Integrate reflection prompts and pre/post check-ins.\n* **Evidence-informed outputs:** Footnoted references to UNESCO, NEQMAP, and regional casework.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Quality Assurance\n\n* All text per **UNESCO style guide** (Word + PDF).\n* All decks in PowerPoint with speaker notes.\n* Draft → feedback → final (3–5 day cycles).\n* Change logs maintained.\n\n---\n\n# 📄 Workplan (Oct 20 start)\n\n| Phase | Deliverable(s)                | Draft → Final   | Notes                       |\n| ----- | ----------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |\n| A1    | Webinar kit (1.1)             | Oct 25 → Oct 30 | Kickoff Oct 20–21           |\n| A2    | Announcements (1.2)           | Oct 28 → Nov 1  | Includes 2 country cases    |\n| A3    | Annual meeting packages (1.3) | Nov 4 → Nov 11  | Ready before Dec 5 meetings |\n| B1    | Two web articles (2.1)        | Nov 14 → Nov 19 | Synthesizing A3             |\n| B2    | Annual report inputs (2.2)    | Nov 20 → Nov 29 | ≤7 pp + annexes             |\n| C1    | Consolidated PPT (3.1)        | Dec 9 → Dec 13  | With speaker notes          |\n| C2    | Thematic brief (3.2)          | Dec 13 → Dec 20 | ≤3 pp + annexes             |\n| D1    | 2026 proposal package (4.1)   | Jan 23 → Jan 30 | Includes priorities + comms |\n| D2    | Evaluation report (4.2)       | Feb 13 → Feb 20 | Wrap-up                     |\n\n---\n\n# 📄 Financial Proposal\n\n**Daily Rate:** USD **500/day**\n**Level of Effort:** 50 days (per workplan)\n**Total Fees:** USD **25,000**\n**Payment Schedule:**\n\n* 30% on contract signature\n* 40% after Dec 20 deliverables accepted (Phase C)\n* 30% after Feb 20 deliverables accepted (Phase E)\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Fees include drafting + 2 revision cycles per deliverable.\n* Travel (if required) to be covered separately (economy + DSA per UNESCO rules).\n* Available starting **20 October 2025** with flexibility for calls before that.\n\n---\n\n👉 Bilal, with this package (cover letter, technical proposal, workplan, financial proposal), you’re ready to compile into the SuccessFactors Word form with CV + employment history + samples.\n\nWould you like me to **draft a 1-page “Past Work Samples” summary** (listing the files you uploaded with a sentence each on context + deliverable type) so you can paste it in as an annex? That way the panel immediately sees how your samples map to their ToR.\n"

Merge the best elements of both\n4. Ask 5 additional improvement questions\n\nLet me analyze both versions:\n\n**Their version (Document 2):**\n- More concise cover letter\n- Includes specific Bloom methodologies (upside-down pyramid, community check-ins)\n- Mentions AI-augmented thinking in methodology\n- Has HerMeNow gender example\n- Simpler workplan table\n- Different payment structure (30/40/30 vs my 40/30/30)\n- More casual/confident tone\n- Less detailed on UNESCO bureaucracy understanding\n- Briefer technical proposal\n\n**My version:**\n- More formal/traditional UN consultancy tone\n- More detailed methodology section\n- Explicit quality assurance protocols\n- More buffer time in workplan for UNESCO review cycles\n- More detailed past work samples section\n- Longer, more comprehensive technical proposal\n- More emphasis on UNESCO familiarity and style guide compliance\n- More conservative timeline with explicit review periods\n\nLet me now create a balanced critique.## Comparative Analysis: 5 Pros & 5 Cons\n\n### **Their Version - PROS:**\n\n1. **Bloom Methodology Specificity** - Names actual frameworks (upside-down pyramid, community check-ins, strengths-based) rather than generic descriptions. This gives UNESCO concrete evidence of pedagogical sophistication.\n\n2. **Confident, Practitioner Voice** - Tone is warmer and more conversational (\"I will contribute,\" \"I am confident\") vs. my more formal UN-ese. Could resonate better with APCEIU educators.\n\n3. **Gender Example Integration** - HerMeNow mention in cover letter is concrete proof of gender-responsive work, not just promising to do it.\n\n4. **Cleaner Workplan Table** - Simpler visual structure (Phase/Deliverable/Timeline/Notes) is easier to scan than my granular breakdown.\n\n5. **AI Transparency** - Acknowledges using LLMs as thinking tools while maintaining human authorship. Shows sophistication about modern work practices.\n\n### **Their Version - CONS:**\n\n1. **Insufficient Review Buffer** - Timeline shows \"Draft → Final\" with only 3-7 days total, but doesn't explicitly account for UNESCO's internal coordination lag. Risk of missed deadlines if feedback takes longer.\n\n2. **Less UNESCO Bureaucracy Literacy** - Doesn't demonstrate understanding of UNESCO's multi-stakeholder review processes, regional office coordination, or typical approval bottlenecks. Could signal naivety.\n\n3. **Weaker Quality Assurance Section** - QA is just 4 bullet points vs. my detailed protocols. UNESCO may want more assurance on editorial standards, revision tracking, and format compliance.\n\n4. **Missing EntreComp/GCED Connection** - While mentioned in my work samples, their technical proposal doesn't explicitly bridge EntreComp experience to GCED competency frameworks. This is a key parallel.\n\n5. **Vague on Work Samples** - Suggests creating a 1-page summary \"with a sentence each\" but doesn't actually include the detailed work sample descriptions I provided. Evaluators need to immediately see relevance.\n\n---\n\n## **MERGED BEST-OF-BOTH VERSION**\n\nI'll now create a synthesis that takes:\n- Their concise, confident tone and Bloom methodology specificity\n- My UNESCO bureaucracy literacy and detailed work samples\n- A workplan that balances clarity with realistic review buffers\n- Their gender example with my quality assurance rigor\n\n---\n\n### **COVER LETTER (Merged)**\n\nDear Hiring Committee,\n\nI am applying for the Consultant – Transformative Education role to support UNESCO Bangkok's GCED Network and Target 4.7. I specialize in turning frameworks into usable outputs—concept notes, agendas, facilitation plans, communications packages, analytical briefs, and presentations—delivered under tight timelines for international stakeholders.\n\nOver 15 years I have designed and documented learning programs across conflict-affected and multicultural contexts. Most recently, I co-developed a sustainable construction curriculum with the **International Trade Centre in Iraq** (2024–25), producing trainer guides and implementation roadmaps for 50+ stakeholders. At **Bloom** (2016-2024), I developed wellbeing-centered methodologies including the **upside-down pyramid** (learner agency), **community check-ins** (psychological safety), and **strengths-based assessments** (resilience-building). These approaches informed 118 accelerator cycles across 16 countries, and I've published on their impact, including research for the **Asfari Foundation** examining post-traumatic growth effects in social entrepreneurship programs.\n\nMy experience directly aligns with UNESCO's GCED priorities. At Bloom, our **HerMeNow program** achieved 50%+ female participation through trauma-informed, gender-responsive design in Lebanon and Jordan. I've worked extensively with **EntreComp** and **GreenComp** frameworks—UNESCO's competency architectures closely aligned with GCED—and understand how to bridge values-based education with assessment systems like NEQMAP.\n\nFor UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU, I will deliver:\n\n**Webinar & meeting packages:** concept notes, agendas, run-of-show documents, slide decks, and communications materials that highlight GCED-NEQMAP synergies\n**Concise web content:** articles (≤250 words) and country case documentation accessible to diverse audiences\n**Analytical synthesis:** thematic reports and annual report inputs (≤7 pages) with gender-responsive, evidence-based recommendations\n**Strategic planning:** 2026 proposal grounded in evaluation of 2025 activities, with realistic implementation and monitoring plans\n\nI am familiar with UNESCO editorial standards and UN system review processes from previous work with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français as both grantee and consultant. I understand the importance of building review buffers, maintaining change logs, and producing materials that balance analytical rigor with accessibility.\n\n**I will be available from 20 October 2025**, with flexibility for coordination calls prior to that date while concluding work in Mosul. Based in Lille, France with stable childcare, I can provide Bangkok overlap (11:00–15:00 ICT) for key calls, with consistent email responsiveness outside those hours.\n\nI am confident my research-to-practice expertise, UN consultancy familiarity, and wellbeing-centered pedagogy will deliver both quality and timeliness for this assignment. I have attached my Employment History Form, CV, work samples, and technical and financial proposals.\n\nWarm regards,  \nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\n### **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL (Merged)**\n\n#### **A. Understanding of the Assignment**\n\nUNESCO Bangkok seeks a consultant to strengthen the Asia-Pacific GCED Network through strategic knowledge products and communications materials across four work phases. The assignment requires balancing urgent October deliverables (webinar packages, annual meeting materials) with substantive analytical synthesis (2025 program reviews) and forward-looking planning (2026 workplan).\n\nSuccess depends on producing concise, gender-responsive materials that bridge GCED competencies with NEQMAP assessment frameworks, maintain UNESCO editorial standards, and support the network's evolution toward systemic, whole-school approaches. The consultant must work remotely with APCEIU and UNESCO Bangkok stakeholders across time zones, managing the 50-day timeline compressed into 3.5 months while allowing for multi-stakeholder review cycles.\n\n#### **B. Methodological Approach**\n\nDrawing from 15 years designing learning programs in complex contexts, I will apply the following principles developed through Bloom's practice and my postgraduate research on post-traumatic growth:\n\n**Practitioner-Centered Design (Upside-Down Pyramid)**  \nAll materials will support GCED practitioners' agency and decision-making rather than being prescriptive. Concept notes and facilitation guides will provide scaffolding and options, not rigid scripts.\n\n**Community-Oriented Facilitation (Convening Circles)**  \nWebinar and meeting designs will embed reflective, collective practices—check-ins, peer exchange, collaborative sense-making—that build belonging and keep GCED people-centered.\n\n**Strengths-Based Framing**  \nAnalytical reports will amplify what's working across the network (evidence of impact, effective practices, promising innovations) while identifying opportunities for growth. This approach builds momentum and motivation.\n\n**Mutual Learning & Cross-Pollination**  \nMaterials will elevate case stories from diverse country contexts, enabling network members to learn from one another's experiences rather than receiving top-down guidance.\n\n**Evidence-Informed & Gender-Responsive**  \nAll content will be grounded in UNESCO research, regional education data, and documented network experiences. Gender analysis will be explicit—highlighting women and girls in GCED examples, using inclusive language, and providing gender-disaggregated data where available. My work on Bloom's **HerMeNow program** (50%+ female participation in Lebanon/Jordan) demonstrates practical experience designing gender-responsive programming in challenging contexts.\n\n**AI-Augmented Workflow**  \nI use large language models as structured thinking and outlining tools to accelerate drafting—never as replacement authors. All content undergoes human review for coherence, accuracy, and UNESCO style compliance.\n\n#### **C. Workflow & Timeline**\n\n*Assumes contract signature by October 15, enabling start on October 20, 2025*\n\n**Phase 1: Discovery & Alignment (Oct 20-21) - 2 days**\n- Desk review of 2024-25 GCED/NEQMAP materials, past APCEIU webinars, network communications\n- Alignment call with UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU to clarify priorities, gather templates, confirm editorial preferences\n- Build micro-style guide (formatting rules, tone guidance, image specifications)\n\n**Phase 2: October Deliverables (Oct 22-Nov 11) - 16 days**\n- **Deliverable 1.1** (Webinar kit): Draft Oct 22-24 → Submit Oct 25 → Review cycle → Finalize Oct 30\n- **Deliverable 1.2** (Announcements): Draft Oct 28-30 → Submit Oct 31 → Review cycle → Finalize Nov 4\n- **Deliverable 1.3** (Annual meeting packages): Draft Nov 4-8 → Submit Nov 8 → Review cycle → Finalize Nov 11\n- *Key milestone: All December meeting materials ready 3+ weeks in advance*\n\n**Phase 3: November Deliverables (Nov 12-29) - 12 days**\n- **Deliverable 2.1** (Web articles): Draft Nov 12-14 → Submit Nov 14 → Review cycle → Finalize Nov 19\n- **Deliverable 2.2** (Annual report inputs): Draft Nov 20-24 → Submit Nov 25 → Review cycle → Finalize Nov 29\n\n**Phase 4: December Synthesis (Dec 9-20) - 10 days**\n- **Deliverable 3.1** (PowerPoint): Draft Dec 9-11 → Submit Dec 12 → Review cycle → Finalize Dec 16\n- **Deliverable 3.2** (Thematic brief): Draft Dec 13-16 → Submit Dec 17 → Review cycle → Finalize Dec 20\n\n**Phase 5: 2026 Planning (Jan 23-Feb 20) - 10 days**\n- **Deliverables 4.1 & 4.2** (Proposal + evaluation): Draft Jan 23-Feb 3 → Submit Feb 4 → Review cycle → Finalize Feb 20\n\n**TOTAL: 50 working days across Oct 20 - Feb 20**\n\n*Note: Each deliverable includes 3-5 day review windows for UNESCO/APCEIU feedback and internal coordination. I maintain flexibility to accommodate urgent requests or additional materials.*\n\n#### **D. Quality Assurance**\n\n- **Editorial Compliance**: All text deliverables copy-edited per UNESCO style guide before submission\n- **Format Flexibility**: Materials delivered in both editable formats (Word, PowerPoint with speaker notes) and PDFs for distribution\n- **Revision Tracking**: Change logs maintained for all feedback incorporation\n- **Visual Accessibility**: PowerPoint decks use clear headers, consistent formatting, and accessible color schemes\n- **Evidence Standards**: All claims footnoted with UNESCO publications, regional data, or documented network experiences\n\n---\n\n### **FINANCIAL PROPOSAL (Merged)**\n\n**Daily Rate:** USD $500/day  \n**Level of Effort:** 50 working days  \n**Total Contract Value:** USD $25,000\n\n**Payment Schedule:**\n- **First installment (40%)**: $10,000 upon contract signature\n- **Second installment (30%)**: $7,500 upon UNESCO acceptance of Phase 3 deliverables (Nov 29 completion)\n- **Final installment (30%)**: $7,500 upon UNESCO acceptance of Phase 5 deliverables (Feb 20 completion)\n\n**Notes:**\n- Fee includes drafting plus two rounds of revisions per deliverable\n- Home-based work from Lille, France; no travel anticipated\n- If UNESCO requests in-person participation (e.g., December annual meetings), travel costs covered separately per UNESCO rules (economy airfare + DSA)\n- Open to fee negotiation to align with UNESCO Bangkok budget parameters while maintaining deliverable scope and quality\n\n---\n\n### **PAST WORK SAMPLES**\n\nThe following samples demonstrate direct experience with the deliverable types required:\n\n**1. Bloom Program Management Guide (2023) - 41 pages**  \n*Relevance: Mirrors Deliverables 1.1, 1.3, 3.1*  \nComprehensive program documentation including facilitation principles for online/in-person engagement, session design frameworks using project-based learning, assessment approaches, and visual presentation of complex concepts. Demonstrates capacity for concept development, agenda structuring, facilitator guidance, and stakeholder communications in UNESCO-style format.\n\n**2. Research Report: Character Strengths & Post-Traumatic Growth (2020) - 10 pages**  \n*Relevance: Mirrors Deliverables 2.2, 3.2, 4.2*  \nAnalytical report for Asfari Foundation examining wellbeing buffering effects during Lebanon's compounded crises (pandemic, explosion, economic collapse). Includes quantitative data visualization, literature review, evidence-based recommendations, and gender-responsive analysis. Demonstrates capacity for analytical synthesis, research-informed writing, and succinct reporting (≤7 pages target).\n\n**3. Web Article: \"Online Acceleration Program Insights\" (2023) - 800 words**  \n*Relevance: Mirrors Deliverables 1.2, 2.1*  \nPublic-facing article distilling 5 years of programmatic learning into accessible insights. Uses clear headers, structured formatting for scannability, practitioner voice with evidence-based claims. Demonstrates concise writing, web-appropriate tone, and ability to synthesize complex programming for diverse audiences.\n\n**Additional Context:**  \nI have worked with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français as both grantee and consultant, familiar with UN editorial standards, procurement processes, and multi-stakeholder coordination. My experience with **EntreComp** (entrepreneurship competencies) and **GreenComp** (sustainability competencies) frameworks provides strong foundation for GCED competency work, as these are closely aligned UNESCO educational architectures.\n\n---\n\n## **5 CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS**\n\nNow I need specific information from you to finalize this application:\n\n### **1. Work Sample Access - How Will Evaluators See Your Materials?**\n\nThe application asks for work samples as \"extra pages at the end of the Word file.\" Will you:\n- **Option A**: Include full PDF pages of all 3 samples (could make doc 60+ pages)\n- **Option B**: Include 2-3 page excerpts from each sample with \"full version available upon request\"\n- **Option C**: Provide hyperlinks in the document to where samples are hosted online\n\n*Why this matters: Affects whether you need to create sanitized/shortened versions NOW or can share full docs.*\n\n### **2. EntreComp/GCED Framing - Should We Be More Explicit?**\n\nYour experience is with EntreComp, but the job is GCED. Should the technical proposal include a short paragraph like:\n\n*\"While I have not worked specifically on GCED Network documentation, my extensive experience with EntreComp (European entrepreneurship competencies) and GreenComp (sustainability competencies) provides direct transferable expertise. All three frameworks share UNESCO's competency-based architecture: GCED's 'Learning to Know/Be/Do/Live Together' parallels EntreComp's 'Ideas-Resources-Action' structure. Both emphasize critical thinking, empathy, systems thinking, and action competence—differences are primarily domain-specific rather than pedagogical.\"*\n\n**Do you want this bridge spelled out, or is the current implicit connection sufficient?**\n\n### **3. Timeline Risk - October 20 Start with Mosul Overlap?**\n\nYou said you're in Mosul until Oct 17 and \"pretty busy.\" The workplan shows substantive drafting starting Oct 22 (Day 3). **Is this realistic?**\n\nShould we either:\n- Push everything by 3 days (start Oct 23, first draft Oct 25)?\n- Keep Oct 20 start but frame Days 1-3 as \"remote desk review and light prep\" while you're transitioning?\n- Front-load more into November to give you breathing room?\n\n*Your call on whether you can actually context-switch from ITC to UNESCO that fast.*\n\n### **4. Payment Structure - What's Your Cash Flow Need?**\n\nI proposed 40/30/30 (more upfront). They proposed 30/40/30 (more mid-contract). Which do you actually need?\n\n- **If you need cash NOW** → Keep 40/30/30\n- **If you're financially stable through November** → Use 30/40/30 to align with their original structure\n- **If you want maximum security** → Propose 50/25/25 (half upfront, justified by front-loaded October work)\n\n*UNESCO may have budget release rules that favor certain structures, but you can propose what works for you.*\n\n### **5. \"Open to Negotiation\" Language - Keep or Remove?**\n\nBoth versions include \"open to discussing rate adjustments\" or \"flexible negotiation.\" This signals willingness to go lower. **Do you actually want to negotiate down, or should we remove this?**\n\n- **Remove it** if $500/day is your floor and you'd rather lose the contract than take less\n- **Keep it** if you'd genuinely accept $450-475/day to secure the work\n- **Reframe it** as \"willing to discuss scope adjustments if budget constraints require\" (preserves rate but allows smaller deliverables)\n\n*What's your actual bottom line?*\n\n---\n\n**Answer these 5 questions and I'll produce the final, submission-ready application package.**",

Evaluators need to immediately see relevance.\n\n---\n\n## **MERGED BEST-OF-BOTH VERSION**\n\nI'll now create a synthesis that takes:\n- Their concise, confident tone and Bloom methodology specificity\n- My UNESCO bureaucracy literacy and detailed work samples\n- A workplan that balances clarity with realistic review buffers\n- Their gender example with my quality assurance rigor\n\n---\n\n### **COVER LETTER (Merged)**\n\nDear Hiring Committee,\n\nI am applying for the Consultant – Transformative Education role to support UNESCO Bangkok's GCED Network and Target 4.7. I specialize in turning frameworks into usable outputs—concept notes, agendas, facilitation plans, communications packages, analytical briefs, and presentations—delivered under tight timelines for international stakeholders.\n\nOver 15 years I have designed and documented learning programs across conflict-affected and multicultural contexts. Most recently, I co-developed a sustainable construction curriculum with the **International Trade Centre in Iraq** (2024–25), producing trainer guides and implementation roadmaps for 50+ stakeholders. At **Bloom** (2016-2024), I developed wellbeing-centered methodologies including the **upside-down pyramid** (learner agency), **community check-ins** (psychological safety), and **strengths-based assessments** (resilience-building). These approaches informed 118 accelerator cycles across 16 countries, and I've published on their impact, including research for the **Asfari Foundation** examining post-traumatic growth effects in social entrepreneurship programs.\n\nMy experience directly aligns with UNESCO's GCED priorities. At Bloom, our **HerMeNow program** achieved 50%+ female participation through trauma-informed, gender-responsive design in Lebanon and Jordan. I've worked extensively with **EntreComp** and **GreenComp** frameworks—UNESCO's competency architectures closely aligned with GCED—and understand how to bridge values-based education with assessment systems like NEQMAP.\n\nFor UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU, I will deliver:\n\n**Webinar & meeting packages:** concept notes, agendas, run-of-show documents, slide decks, and communications materials that highlight GCED-NEQMAP synergies\n**Concise web content:** articles (≤250 words) and country case documentation accessible to diverse audiences\n**Analytical synthesis:** thematic reports and annual report inputs (≤7 pages) with gender-responsive, evidence-based recommendations\n**Strategic planning:** 2026 proposal grounded in evaluation of 2025 activities, with realistic implementation and monitoring plans\n\nI am familiar with UNESCO editorial standards and UN system review processes from previous work with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français as both grantee and consultant. I understand the importance of building review buffers, maintaining change logs, and producing materials that balance analytical rigor with accessibility.\n\n**I will be available from 20 October 2025**, with flexibility for coordination calls prior to that date while concluding work in Mosul. Based in Lille, France with stable childcare, I can provide Bangkok overlap (11:00–15:00 ICT) for key calls, with consistent email responsiveness outside those hours.\n\nI am confident my research-to-practice expertise, UN consultancy familiarity, and wellbeing-centered pedagogy will deliver both quality and timeliness for this assignment. I have attached my Employment History Form, CV, work samples, and technical and financial proposals.\n\nWarm regards,  \nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\n### **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL (Merged)**\n\n#### **A. Understanding of the Assignment**\n\nUNESCO Bangkok seeks a consultant to strengthen the Asia-Pacific GCED Network through strategic knowledge products and communications materials across four work phases. The assignment requires balancing urgent October deliverables (webinar packages, annual meeting materials) with substantive analytical synthesis (2025 program reviews) and forward-looking planning (2026 workplan).\n\nSuccess depends on producing concise, gender-responsive materials that bridge GCED competencies with NEQMAP assessment frameworks, maintain UNESCO editorial standards, and support the network's evolution toward systemic, whole-school approaches. The consultant must work remotely with APCEIU and UNESCO Bangkok stakeholders across time zones, managing the 50-day timeline compressed into 3.5 months while allowing for multi-stakeholder review cycles.\n\n#### **B. Methodological Approach**\n\nDrawing from 15 years designing learning programs in complex contexts, I will apply the following principles developed through Bloom's practice and my postgraduate research on post-traumatic growth:\n\n**Practitioner-Centered Design (Upside-Down Pyramid)**  \nAll materials will support GCED practitioners' agency and decision-making rather than being prescriptive. Concept notes and facilitation guides will provide scaffolding and options, not rigid scripts.\n\n**Community-Oriented Facilitation (Convening Circles)**  \nWebinar and meeting designs will embed reflective, collective practices—check-ins, peer exchange, collaborative sense-making—that build belonging and keep GCED people-centered.\n\n**Strengths-Based Framing**  \nAnalytical reports will amplify what's working across the network (evidence of impact, effective practices, promising innovations) while identifying opportunities for growth. This approach builds momentum and motivation.\n\n**Mutual Learning & Cross-Pollination**  \nMaterials will elevate case stories from diverse country contexts, enabling network members to learn from one another's experiences rather than receiving top-down guidance.\n\n**Evidence-Informed & Gender-Responsive**  \nAll content will be grounded in UNESCO research, regional education data, and documented network experiences. Gender analysis will be explicit—highlighting women and girls in GCED examples, using inclusive language, and providing gender-disaggregated data where available. My work on Bloom's **HerMeNow program** (50%+ female participation in Lebanon/Jordan) demonstrates practical experience designing gender-responsive programming in challenging contexts.\n\n**AI-Augmented Workflow**  \nI use large language models as structured thinking and outlining tools to accelerate drafting—never as replacement authors. All content undergoes human review for coherence, accuracy, and UNESCO style compliance.\n\n#### **C. Workflow & Timeline**\n\n*Assumes contract signature by October 15, enabling start on October 20, 2025*\n\n**Phase 1: Discovery & Alignment (Oct 20-21) - 2 days**\n- Desk review of 2024-25 GCED/NEQMAP materials, past APCEIU webinars, network communications\n- Alignment call with UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU to clarify priorities, gather templates, confirm editorial preferences\n- Build micro-style guide (formatting rules, tone guidance, image specifications)\n\n**Phase 2: October Deliverables (Oct 22-Nov 11) - 16 days**\n- **Deliverable 1.1** (Webinar kit): Draft Oct 22-24 → Submit Oct 25 → Review cycle → Finalize Oct 30\n- **Deliverable 1.2** (Announcements): Draft Oct 28-30 → Submit Oct 31 → Review cycle → Finalize Nov 4\n- **Deliverable 1.3** (Annual meeting packages): Draft Nov 4-8 → Submit Nov 8 → Review cycle → Finalize Nov 11\n- *Key milestone: All December meeting materials ready 3+ weeks in advance*\n\n**Phase 3: November Deliverables (Nov 12-29) - 12 days**\n- **Deliverable 2.1** (Web articles): Draft Nov 12-14 → Submit Nov 14 → Review cycle → Finalize Nov 19\n- **Deliverable 2.2** (Annual report inputs): Draft Nov 20-24 → Submit Nov 25 → Review cycle → Finalize Nov 29\n\n**Phase 4: December Synthesis (Dec 9-20) - 10 days**\n- **Deliverable 3.1** (PowerPoint): Draft Dec 9-11 → Submit Dec 12 → Review cycle → Finalize Dec 16\n- **Deliverable 3.2** (Thematic brief): Draft Dec 13-16 → Submit Dec 17 → Review cycle → Finalize Dec 20\n\n**Phase 5: 2026 Planning (Jan 23-Feb 20) - 10 days**\n- **Deliverables 4.1 & 4.2** (Proposal + evaluation): Draft Jan 23-Feb 3 → Submit Feb 4 → Review cycle → Finalize Feb 20\n\n**TOTAL: 50 working days across Oct 20 - Feb 20**\n\n*Note: Each deliverable includes 3-5 day review windows for UNESCO/APCEIU feedback and internal coordination. I maintain flexibility to accommodate urgent requests or additional materials.*\n\n#### **D.

Bloom Program Management Guide (2023) - 41 pages**  \n*Relevance: Mirrors Deliverables 1.1, 1.3, 3.1*  \nComprehensive program documentation including facilitation principles for online/in-person engagement, session design frameworks using project-based learning, assessment approaches, and visual presentation of complex concepts. Demonstrates capacity for concept development, agenda structuring, facilitator guidance, and stakeholder communications in UNESCO-style format.\n\n**2. Research Report: Character Strengths & Post-Traumatic Growth (2020) - 10 pages**  \n*Relevance: Mirrors Deliverables 2.2, 3.2, 4.2*  \nAnalytical report for Asfari Foundation examining wellbeing buffering effects during Lebanon's compounded crises (pandemic, explosion, economic collapse). Includes quantitative data visualization, literature review, evidence-based recommendations, and gender-responsive analysis. Demonstrates capacity for analytical synthesis, research-informed writing, and succinct reporting (≤7 pages target).\n\n**3. Web Article: \"Online Acceleration Program Insights\" (2023) - 800 words**  \n*Relevance: Mirrors Deliverables 1.2, 2.1*  \nPublic-facing article distilling 5 years of programmatic learning into accessible insights. Uses clear headers, structured formatting for scannability, practitioner voice with evidence-based claims. Demonstrates concise writing, web-appropriate tone, and ability to synthesize complex programming for diverse audiences.\n\n**Additional Context:**  \nI have worked with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français as both grantee and consultant, familiar with UN editorial standards, procurement processes, and multi-stakeholder coordination. My experience with **EntreComp** (entrepreneurship competencies) and **GreenComp** (sustainability competencies) frameworks provides strong foundation for GCED competency work, as these are closely aligned UNESCO educational architectures.\n\n---\n\n## **5 CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS**\n\nNow I need specific information from you to finalize this application:\n\n### **1. Work Sample Access - How Will Evaluators See Your Materials?**\n\nThe application asks for work samples as \"extra pages at the end of the Word file.\" Will you:\n- **Option A**: Include full PDF pages of all 3 samples (could make doc 60+ pages)\n- **Option B**: Include 2-3 page excerpts from each sample with \"full version available upon request\"\n- **Option C**: Provide hyperlinks in the document to where samples are hosted online\n\n*Why this matters: Affects whether you need to create sanitized/shortened versions NOW or can share full docs.*\n\n### **2. EntreComp/GCED Framing - Should We Be More Explicit?**\n\nYour experience is with EntreComp, but the job is GCED. Should the technical proposal include a short paragraph like:\n\n*\"While I have not worked specifically on GCED Network documentation, my extensive experience with EntreComp (European entrepreneurship competencies) and GreenComp (sustainability competencies) provides direct transferable expertise. All three frameworks share UNESCO's competency-based architecture: GCED's 'Learning to Know/Be/Do/Live Together' parallels EntreComp's 'Ideas-Resources-Action' structure. Both emphasize critical thinking, empathy, systems thinking, and action competence—differences are primarily domain-specific rather than pedagogical.\"*\n\n**Do you want this bridge spelled out, or is the current implicit connection sufficient?**\n\n### **3. Timeline Risk - October 20 Start with Mosul Overlap?**\n\nYou said you're in Mosul until Oct 17 and \"pretty busy.\" The workplan shows substantive drafting starting Oct 22 (Day 3). **Is this realistic?**\n\nShould we either:\n- Push everything by 3 days (start Oct 23, first draft Oct 25)?\n- Keep Oct 20 start but frame Days 1-3 as \"remote desk review and light prep\" while you're transitioning?\n- Front-load more into November to give you breathing room?\n\n*Your call on whether you can actually context-switch from ITC to UNESCO that fast.*\n\n### **4. Payment Structure - What's Your Cash Flow Need?**\n\nI proposed 40/30/30 (more upfront). They proposed 30/40/30 (more mid-contract). Which do you actually need?\n\n- **If you need cash NOW** → Keep 40/30/30\n- **If you're financially stable through November** → Use 30/40/30 to align with their original structure\n- **If you want maximum security** → Propose 50/25/25 (half upfront, justified by front-loaded October work)\n\n*UNESCO may have budget release rules that favor certain structures, but you can propose what works for you.*\n\n### **5. \"Open to Negotiation\" Language - Keep or Remove?**\n\nBoth versions include \"open to discussing rate adjustments\" or \"flexible negotiation.\" This signals willingness to go lower. **Do you actually want to negotiate down, or should we remove this?**\n\n- **Remove it** if $500/day is your floor and you'd rather lose the contract than take less\n- **Keep it** if you'd genuinely accept $450-475/day to secure the work\n- **Reframe it** as \"willing to discuss scope adjustments if budget constraints require\" (preserves rate but allows smaller deliverables)\n\n*What's your actual bottom line?*\n\n---\n\n**Answer these 5 questions and I'll produce the final, submission-ready application package.**",

Wants me to actually research and verify:\n   - EntreComp framework details\n   - GreenComp framework details  \n   - UNESCO's GCED competency architecture\n   - Verify if they actually align like I claimed\n3. Add something about cross-cultural work (Sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa to Middle East) and how it relates to the civic/global citizenship element of GCED\n4. Timeline: Yes, make Days 1-3 lighter (desk review/onboarding), push more substantive work into November\n5. Payment: 40/30/30 is fine\n6. Rate negotiation: Keep it flexible, willing to go $450-475\n\nSo I need to:\n1. Search project knowledge for GCED information\n2. Use web_search to research EntreComp, GreenComp, and GCED frameworks\n3. Verify the alignment I claimed\n4. Add a paragraph about cross-cultural competency that connects to GCED's global citizenship focus\n5. Revise the timeline to be more realistic\n6. Keep negotiation language\n\nLet me start by searching the project knowledge for any GCED info, then do web searches.Perfect, let me research the actual frameworks to make sure our claims are accurate. I'll search for GCED, EntreComp, and GreenComp details.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGood, I found EntreComp mentioned in the project knowledge. Now let me search the web for detailed information on GCED, EntreComp, and GreenComp frameworks to verify the alignment.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGreat! I found good information on GCED. Key points:\n- GCED has three conceptual dimensions: Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioural \n- Three pillars: respect for diversity, solidarity, and shared sense of humanity\n- It's based on UNESCO's 2023 Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights and Sustainable Development\n- It emphasizes values, attitudes, knowledge, and skills\n- It's not a single subject but a framework/prism through which education is considered\n\nNow let me search for EntreComp details.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nExcellent! Now I have detailed information on EntreComp:\n- 3 competence areas: Ideas and Opportunities, Resources, Into Action\n- 15 competences total (5 in each area)\n- 442 learning outcomes\n- 8 proficiency levels from beginner to expert\n- It's transversal across education, work, and civic engagement\n- Process-oriented: seeing opportunities → gathering resources → taking action\n\nNow let me search for GreenComp.\n```\nThis block is not supported on your current device yet.\n```\n\nGreat! Now I have all the information I need. Let me summarize what I've found:\n\n**GCED (Global Citizenship Education):**\n- Three conceptual dimensions: Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, Behavioural\n- Three pillars: respect for diversity, solidarity, shared sense of humanity\n- Based on UNESCO's 2023 Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights and Sustainable Development\n- Focused on knowledge, skills, values, attitudes for global citizenship\n- Aims to nurture respect for all, build sense of belonging to common humanity\n\n**EntreComp:**\n- 3 competence areas: Ideas and Opportunities, Resources, Into Action\n- 15 competences total (5 in each area)\n- 442 learning outcomes\n- 8 proficiency levels\n- Process-oriented: identifying opportunities → mobilizing resources → taking action\n- Transversal across education, work, and civic engagement\n\n**GreenComp:**\n- 4 competence areas: Embodying sustainability values, Embracing complexity in sustainability, Envisioning sustainable futures, Acting for sustainability\n- 12 competences (3 in each area)\n- Knowledge, skills, and attitudes for sustainable living\n- Interrelated and interconnected competences\n\nAll three frameworks:\n1. Are competency-based (not just knowledge-based)\n2. Emphasize knowledge + skills + attitudes/values\n3. Are designed for lifelong learning across formal/non-formal/informal contexts\n4. Focus on transforming learners into active citizens/agents of change\n5. Use similar pedagogical approaches: learner-centered, project-based, experiential\n6. Are non-prescriptive reference frameworks to be adapted to context\n\nThe alignment is real and strong. They're all part of the European Commission's broader competency framework family (along with DigComp, LifeComp).\n\nNow let me create the final merged application with:\n1. Updated technical proposal with verified framework connections\n2. Cross-cultural competency paragraph linking to GCED's global citizenship focus\n\n\nI'll adjust the project timeline to be more streamlined, keeping the core payment structure intact. The revised approach will create a lighter workload for the first three days while maintaining the original 40/30/30 payment split. I'll preserve the existing negotiation language to ensure clarity and flexibility in our project approach.Perfect! I now have verified the framework alignments.

These approaches informed 118 accelerator cycles across 16 countries—from Lebanon and Jordan to Kenya, Rwanda, and across the Gulf—and I've published on their impact, including research for the **Asfari Foundation** examining post-traumatic growth effects in social entrepreneurship programs.\n\nMy experience directly aligns with UNESCO's GCED priorities. At Bloom, our **HerMeNow program** achieved 50%+ female participation through trauma-informed, gender-responsive design in Lebanon and Jordan. I've worked extensively with **EntreComp** and **GreenComp** frameworks—both developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre alongside UNESCO's competency architectures—and understand how to bridge values-based education with assessment systems like NEQMAP. My work across Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East has taught me how to identify universal pedagogical principles while honoring cultural context—essential for fostering the \"shared sense of humanity\" central to GCED.\n\nFor UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU, I will deliver:\n\n**Webinar & meeting packages:** concept notes, agendas, run-of-show documents, slide decks, and communications materials that highlight GCED-NEQMAP synergies  \n**Concise web content:** articles (≤250 words) and country case documentation accessible to diverse audiences  \n**Analytical synthesis:** thematic reports and annual report inputs (≤7 pages) with gender-responsive, evidence-based recommendations  \n**Strategic planning:** 2026 proposal grounded in evaluation of 2025 activities, with realistic implementation and monitoring plans\n\nI am familiar with UNESCO editorial standards and UN system review processes from previous work with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français as both grantee and consultant.

Based in Lille, France with stable childcare, I can provide Bangkok overlap (11:00–15:00 ICT) for key calls, with consistent email responsiveness outside those hours.\n\nI am confident my research-to-practice expertise, UN consultancy familiarity, and wellbeing-centered pedagogy will deliver both quality and timeliness for this assignment. I have attached my Employment History Form, CV, work samples, and technical and financial proposals.\n\nWarm regards,  \nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\n## **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL**\n\n### **A. Understanding of the Assignment**\n\nUNESCO Bangkok seeks a consultant to strengthen the Asia-Pacific GCED Network through strategic knowledge products and communications materials across four work phases. The assignment requires balancing urgent October deliverables (webinar packages, annual meeting materials) with substantive analytical synthesis (2025 program reviews) and forward-looking planning (2026 workplan).\n\nSuccess depends on producing concise, gender-responsive materials that bridge GCED competencies with NEQMAP assessment frameworks, maintain UNESCO editorial standards, and support the network's evolution toward systemic, whole-school approaches. The consultant must work remotely with APCEIU and UNESCO Bangkok stakeholders across time zones, managing the 50-day timeline compressed into 3.5 months while allowing for multi-stakeholder review cycles.\n\n### **B. Methodological Approach**\n\nDrawing from 15 years designing learning programs in complex contexts, I will apply the following principles developed through Bloom's practice and my postgraduate research on post-traumatic growth:\n\n**Practitioner-Centered Design (Upside-Down Pyramid)**  \nAll materials will support GCED practitioners' agency and decision-making rather than being prescriptive. Concept notes and facilitation guides will provide scaffolding and options, not rigid scripts.\n\n**Community-Oriented Facilitation (Convening Circles)**  \nWebinar and meeting designs will embed reflective, collective practices—check-ins, peer exchange, collaborative sense-making—that build belonging and keep GCED people-centered.\n\n**Strengths-Based Framing**  \nAnalytical reports will amplify what's working across the network (evidence of impact, effective practices, promising innovations) while identifying opportunities for growth. This approach builds momentum and motivation rather than focusing on deficits.\n\n**Mutual Learning & Cross-Pollination**  \nMaterials will elevate case stories from diverse country contexts, enabling network members to learn from one another's experiences. Having worked across Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East, I've learned to identify pedagogical universals—the shared human needs for connection, meaning, and efficacy—while honoring how culture shapes implementation. This skill directly supports GCED's emphasis on \"shared sense of humanity\" across diverse societies.\n\n**Evidence-Informed & Gender-Responsive**  \nAll content will be grounded in UNESCO research, regional education data, and documented network experiences. Gender analysis will be explicit—highlighting women and girls in GCED examples, using inclusive language, and providing gender-disaggregated data where available. My work on Bloom's **HerMeNow program** (50%+ female participation in Lebanon/Jordan) demonstrates practical experience designing gender-responsive programming in challenging contexts.\n\n**Competency Framework Literacy**  \nWhile I have not worked specifically on GCED Network documentation, my extensive experience with **EntreComp** (entrepreneurship competencies) and **GreenComp** (sustainability competencies) provides direct transferable expertise. All three frameworks—GCED, EntreComp, and GreenComp—are part of the European Commission's competency-based learning architecture and share foundational principles:\n\n- **Structure**: All organize competencies into interrelated areas (GCED: Cognitive-Socio-emotional-Behavioural; EntreComp: Ideas-Resources-Action; GreenComp: Values-Complexity-Futures-Action)\n- **Components**: All define competence as knowledge + skills + attitudes/values, not just cognitive knowledge\n- **Orientation**: All emphasize transforming learners into active agents of change in their communities\n- **Pedagogy**: All advocate learner-centered, project-based, experiential approaches\n- **Application**: All are designed as non-prescriptive reference frameworks adaptable across formal/non-formal/informal learning contexts\n\nThe pedagogical differences are primarily domain-specific (entrepreneurship vs. sustainability vs. global citizenship) rather than structural. My fluency in translating competency frameworks into practical learning activities, assessment tools, and educator guidance directly transfers to GCED work.\n\n**AI-Augmented Workflow**  \nI use large language models as structured thinking and outlining tools to accelerate drafting—never as replacement authors.

Character Strengths\r\nCharacter strengths are invaluable tools that guide us in developing skills and\r\nenhancing our effectiveness in any endeavor. Leveraging these strengths makes\r\nlearning new things more accessible and enjoyable. In Bloom programs, we use the\r\nValues in Action (VIA) Character Strengths assessment to help individuals identify their\r\n“Signature Strengths.” These strengths appear naturally and authentically, providing\r\nenergy rather than requiring effort. Using our Signature Strengths promotes well-being\r\nand vitality in the workplace, leading to greater engagement and productivity. The VIA\r\nassessment analyzes virtues and values across cultures, identifying 24 universally\r\nrecognized character strengths. These strengths are clustered into six core virtues:\r\n1. Wisdom and Knowledge: Creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of\r\nlearning, perspective, and innovation. These strengths enable us to gain and use\r\nknowledge effectively.\r\n2. Courage: Bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality, and zest. These strengths help us\r\nface challenges and pursue goals despite obstacles.\r\n3. Humanity: Love, kindness, and social intelligence. These strengths foster\r\nmeaningful and supportive relationships with others.\r\n4. Justice: Citizenship, fairness, and leadership. These strengths contribute to a just\r\nand equitable community.\r\n5. Temperance: Forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, and self-control. These\r\nstrengths help us regulate our behaviors and emotions.\r\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 5 of 41",

Connected within the Target 4.7, Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) are recognized as mutually reinforcing approaches: both prioritize the relevance and content of education in order to ensure that education helps build a peaceful and sustainable world and both emphasize the need to foster the knowledge, skills, values, attitudes and behaviours tha\n\nThe primary aim of Global Citizenship Education (GCED) is nurturing respect for all, building a sense of belonging to a common humanity and helping learners become responsible and active global citizens. GCED aims to empower learners to assume active roles to face and resolve global challenges and to become proactive contributors to a more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and secure world. Education for global citizenship helps young people develop the core competencies which allow them to actively engage with the world, and help to make it a more just and sustainable place. It is a form of civic learning that involves students' active participation in projects that address global issues of a social, political, economic, or environmental nature. The UN’s Global Education First Initiative notes, “It is not enough for education to produce individuals who can read, write and count.\n\nOxfam believes that global citizenship education enables young people to develop the core competencies which allow them to actively engage with the world, and help to make it a more just and sustainable place. At Oxfam, the philosophy of global citizenship is implemented through a whole-school approach which involves everyone from learners themselves to the wider community. It is also promoted in the classroom through teaching the existing curriculum in a way that highlights aspects such as social justice, the appreciation of diversity and the importance of sustainable development. In this way, global citizenship education grounds learning in practical life situations, creates a culture of global knowledge about other societies thus instilling tolerance and challenging inequality, emphasizes the importance of individual and collective power and creates a sense of social responsibility.",

Growing interest in global citizenship has resulted in increased attention to the global dimension in citizenship education as well, and the implications for policy, curricula, teaching and learning.4 Global citizenship education entails three core conceptual dimensions, which are common to various definitions and interpretations of global citizenship education. These core conceptual dimensions draw on a review of literature, conceptual frameworks, approaches and curricula on global citizenship education, as well as technical consultations and recent work in this area by UNESCO. They can serve as the basis for defining global citizenship education goals, learning objectives and competencies, as well as priorities for assessing and evaluating learning.\n\nOther issues to consider in the assessment and evaluation of global citizenship education learning outcomes include processes (e.g. teaching and learning practices, learner engagement) and outcomes (e.g. individual and group knowledge, skills, values and attitudes and achievements), as well as contextual issues (e.g. curriculum documents, institutional policies, teaching competencies, administrative commitment and support, resources, learning environment, community relationships). Throughout the planning process, issues of validity, reliability and fairness need to be considered in the design and application of assessment and evaluation practices. Although there are no globally agreed indicators for monitoring global citizenship education learning outcomes as yet, it is expected that a proposed measurement framework and potential indicators will become available soon.\n\nStevick, D. and Levinson, B. 2007.

An increasingly globalised world has raised questions about what constitutes meaningful citizenship as well as about its global dimensions. Although the notion of citizenship that goes beyond the nation state is not new, changes in the global context – for example, the establishment of international conventions and treaties, the growth of transnational organisations, corporations and civil society movements, and the development of international human rights frameworks – have significant implications for global citizenship.

The two main elements of GCE are 'global consciousness'; the moral or ethical aspect of global issues, and 'global competencies', or skills meant to enable learners to participate in changing and developing the world. The promotion of GCE was a response by governments and NGOs to the emergence of supranational institution, regional economic blocs, and the development of information and communications technologies. These have all resulted in the emergence of a more globally oriented and collaborative approach to education. GCE addresses themes such as peace and human rights, intercultural understanding, citizenship education, respect for diversity and tolerance, and inclusiveness.\n\nThis pedagogical technique can be utilized in the case of almost any school subject, \"[and] is the primary pedagogical strategy in the discourse of global competencies. Educators see it as an important method for developing the tools- technical and emotional- for success in the global society\". With the aim of nurturing students' potential to be both learners and citizens, the project-based approach has been used successfully in community-based learning, for example. Another important pedagogical feature of GCE is learning through communicative practices outside the classroom that \"harness […] the educational force of the wider culture\". If students are encouraged \"to see themselves as political agents\", educators assume they are more likely to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to become agents of change. Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via Social Network Se\n\nUnlike national citizenship, global citizenship does not denote any legal status or allegiance to an actual form of government. The emergence of regional economic blocs, supra-national political institutions such as the European Union, and the advancement of ICTs, has caused governments to try to prepare national populations to be competitive in the global jobs market. This has led to the introduction of global citizenship education programs at primary, secondary, and tertiary level, but also at independent NGOs, grass roots organizations, and other large scale educational organizations, such as the International Baccalaureate Organization and UNESCO. The most important features of global citizenship education are voluntary action that can extend from local to international collectives; the practice of cultural empathy; and a focus on active participation in social and political life at the local and global level.\n\nIn the late 1990s, OXFAM UK designed a curriculum for global citizenship education which stressed \"the 'active' role of global citizens\".In this approach, individuals and groups both inside and outside the educational sector might take action that addresses human rights, trade, poverty, health, and environmental issues, for example. This is sometimes called the 'global consciousness' aspect of GCE. However, organizations such as UNESCO have also begun to emphasize 'global competencies', including science and technology into their GCE curricula. In the present era of globalization, the recognition of global interdependence on the part of the general public has led to a higher degree of interest in global citizenship in education. Though modern schooling may have been oriented to education suitable for the nation-state throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, in the 21st century, citizenship is understood in global terms, so that schooling might improve individual nations' global competit",

The need and the rationale for global citizenship education (GCED) were ever more emphasized by many educational organizations, including UNESCO. This article reviews the GCED discourses conceptualizing global competence as instrumental action and a binary view of global-local relations. In turn, the article proposes the idea of curriculum-as-relations for GCED. Curriculum-as-relations conceptualizes competence as situated praxis and focuses on providing authentic critical-translocal learning. Authentic critical-translocal learning through the strategy of comparison offers an alternative view of global-local relations as “articulated moments created by situated praxis”. This new understanding of global-local relations may help different stakeholders to imagine GCED curricula beyond a Tylerian instrumentalist, ends-means orientation o\n\nCurriculum-as-relations, with the notion of competence as situated praxis, offers tangible opportunities for learners to access and to contribute to global memory space. This would better serve to foster the three pillars of GCED: respect for diversity, solidarity, and a shared sense of humanity (UNESCO 2018, p. 2). In thinking about global-local relations as articulated moments, I am reminded of Donna Haraway’s (1988) caution about the danger of relativism, as it is “a way of being nowhere while claiming to be everywhere equally” (p. 534). I am also mindful of not viewing global memory space and global-local relations as articulate moments and as a utopic place of intermixture and hybridity, overlooking the power dynamics necessarily involved. The Covid-19 outbreak allowed us to realize the increased connectivity of the world yet also provided a reminder of the economic and social disparities stemming from equity issues that continue to exist.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic was an opportunity to reflect on and reimagine the present and future of curriculum. Meanwhile, it reminded us to continuously strive to foster “respect for diversity, solidarity and a shared sense of humanity”, the three pillars of GCED (UNESCO 2018, p. 2). In this article, I illustrated that our era is no longer in a knowledge-based economy but rather in a learning economy where know-who and ability to unlearn through critical reflexivity become core assets. I suggested learning by interacting, which leads to a conceptualization of GCED focusing on competence as situated praxis rather than on instrumental action (Aoki 1984). Furthermore, I suggested the view of curriculum-as-relations. As such, global-local relations are conceptualized beyond the existing geographic-spatial sense. The global-local relations I illustrated here include social-temporal-situational focusing on the network of people involved in communicating and reflecting together in a particular si\n\nWhile many versions of GCED curricula exist, they are similar in that they seek to articulate and teach the moral, economic, and civic imperatives for a changing and connected global world (OECD 2018). For example, with respect to the moral imperative, it is argued that GCED can help prepare future citizens to live harmoniously in a globalized world consisting of “multicultural communities” (OECD 2018, p. 2). In that sense, GCED fosters values including “respect for diversity, solidarity and a shared sense of humanity” (UNESCO 2018, p. 2). With regard to the economic imperative, GCED prepares future citizens to thrive in a changing labor market (OCED 2018). In this light, “effective communication and appropriate behaviours” stemming from intercultural understanding, along with critical reflections on the set of technologies, become important aspects of global competence (OECD 2018, p.",

                "text": "In an increasingly interconnected world, global citizenship education (GCED) plays a crucial role in promoting solidarity and empowering people of all ages to make a meaningful impact in their communities, both locally and globally. But what does GCED entail, why is it especially relevant today, and how is UNESCO leading the way in advancing this vital approach to learning? ... For centuries, common aspirations for mutual respect, peace, and understanding were reflected in traditional concepts across cultures and civilizations – from 'ubuntu' (I am because we are) in African philosophy to 'sumak kawsay' (harmony within communities, ourselves and nature) in Quechua. Although the term \"global citizenship education\" was only coined in 2011, the values it represents have been central to UNESCO's mission since its founding in 1947. By building peace through education and reminding humanity of our common ties, UNESCO has long championed the ideas now formalized as GCED.\n\nGCED is not a single subject with a set curriculum but rather a framework, a prism through which education is considered. It can be delivered as an integral part of existing subjects — from geography to social studies — or independently. UNESCO supports the dissemination of GCED on different levels and in multiple areas of life beyond the classroom. At the policy level: Governments can develop national strategies and frameworks that recognize the importance of understanding local issues from a broader global perspective and prioritize education programmes that reflect this vision. In the classroom: Teachers can incorporate content and materials that build awareness of global issues and intercultural understanding. For instance, in Geography, pupils can learn about climate change and the distribution of resources. In Social Sciences, they find out how environmental degradation impacts children's rights worldwide.\n\nAs our world grows increasingly interdependent, GCED is more vital than ever for international solidarity and inspiring learners of all ages to positively contribute to their local and global communities. But what exactly does global citizenship education entail, why does it matter today, and how is UNESCO driving this movement? Unlike citizenship — rights, privileges and responsibilities related to \"belonging\" to a particular nation/state, the global citizenship concept is based on the idea that we are connected not with just one country but with a broader global community. So, by positively contributing to it, we can also influence change at the regional, national and local levels. Global citizens don't have a special passport or an official title, nor do they need to travel abroad or speak multiple languages to become one. Being a global citizen is more about mindset and everyday actions a person takes.\n\nEconomically, environmentally, socially and politically, we are linked to other people on the planet as never before. With the transformations that the world has gone through in the past decades — expansion of digital technology, international travel and migration, economic crises, conflicts, and environmental degradation — how we work, teach and learn must change, too. UNESCO promotes global citizenship education to help learners understand the world around them and work together to fix the big problems that affect everyone, no matter where they're from. GCED is about teaching and learning to become these global citizens who peacefully live together on one planet. What does that entail? Adjusting curricula and lessons content to increase knowledge about the world and the interconnected nature of contemporary challenges and threats. That includes, among other things, a deep understanding of human rights, geography, the environment, systems of inequalities, and historical events that un",

                "text": "We chose vocational education teachers as our primary target group, based on the assumption that many of these teachers do not have the time (and inclination) to go through scientific publications in their free time. In addition to vocational teachers, a second target group came to mind while writing, namely secondary school teachers. This group, particularly in upper secondary education, is increasingly interested in entrepreneurship education. However, the book focuses on tertiary education, and this is also reflected in the terminology used. For example, we generally speak of students, and not of apprentices as is more usual in secondary education. We chose the EntreComp framework developed on behalf of the European Commission as a starting point because it is widely used in Europe, it is easily accessible, it includes a relevant selection of entrepreneurial competencies, and above all, it applies a broad, inclusive definition of entrepreneurship.\n\nInsights from the scholarly field of entrepreneurship education are not often given priority in teacher training or professional development programmes. Knowledge on entrepreneurship education, being developed, but little of it is being disseminated specifically for the target group of vocational education students, let alone used in the classroom. The EntreComp document itself also offers some guidance as to the activities, processes and behaviours involved and thus the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes underlying the 15 competencies. Inspired by the arrival of the European EntreComp framework in 2016 (see Further Reading box below [1]), we want to extend that. We do this in particular for teachers and trainers who want to work even harder on broad-based entrepreneurship education in vocational education and secondary schools. The competencies of EntreComp are developed at the age of the very group of students these teachers serve, and they have a demonstrable effect at a late\n\nWith domain-specific knowledge, attitude and skills, you are able to identify problems and formulate possible solutions [see for example the competency Creativity]. We will therefore consistently use the term entrepreneurial competencies on this website, and not for example entrepreneurial skills, to indicate that knowledge and attitude are of equal importance. Various theoretical perspectives have been used to try to draw up lists of competencies for entrepreneurship. As context and domain play an important role in determining which competencies are needed, there are many different 'competency lists' in entrepreneurship research. One way of choosing among competence lists is to use the perspective of the entrepreneurial process. There is much less discussion about this. The entrepreneurial process is essentially about 1. Seeing ideas and opportunities; 2. Gathering and using resources; and 3. Taking action. These are the terms used in the European EntreComp framework (see box Further \n\n(Source: Bacigalupo, M., Kampylis, P., Punie, Y., & Van den Brande, G. (2016). EntreComp: The Entrepreneurship Competence Framework Luxembourg: Publication Office of the European Union) Not everyone can be measured against the same yardstick. How do we know if students are making progress? In measuring the degree of competence in the EntreComp we come up against the issue that it is difficult to quantify the degree of competence for these competencies. This applies both in an objective sense and in a subjective sense. The competencies discussed in this book cannot be compared to a skill such as, for example, speed typing, where one can easily determine the number of keystrokes and the number of errors per minute. Objective assessments generally lack a validated specification as well as a measure of the dimensions that make up a competency. With subjective assessments the frame of reference varies, and it also shifts over time.",

Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive learning outcomes for entrepreneurship education is identified as one of the main hindrances to the development of entrepreneurial learning in Europe (European Commission, 2017). In an effort to establish a common standard framework for entrepreneurial competences, the European Commission introduced the European Entrepreneurship Com\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the quantitative results obtained from matching the entrepreneurial competences identified in the literature with the EntreComp framework. The primary aim of this analysis is to gauge the degree of relevance assigned to different entrepreneurial competences within the literature. Additionally, this examination serves the purpose of detecting potential disparities or omissions between the competences delineated in the literature and those incorporated within · The study conducted reveals interesting properties about EntreComp's approach, structure and contents. In the following sections, we delve into the validation and further enhancements of EntreComp, exploring its implications for entrepreneurship education and identifying areas for further research. This study conducted a systematic literature review of entrepreneurial competences, focusing on highly cited and relevant papers, and aligning them with the European Entrepreneurship Competence Frame\n\nWe propose pathways for updating EntreComp and directions for future entrepreneurship education and research. This study conducts a comprehensive review of entrepreneurial competences, utilising a systematic literature analysis encompassing 140 documents up to 2022. The primary objective is to critically examine the EntreComp framework, validating its structure and content through a meticulous comparison with competences identified in the literature. The findings confirm the robustness of EntreComp, emphasising the process-oriented nature of entrepreneurship, from opportunity identification to value creation. While EntreComp aligns with the majority of competences identified in the literature, certain nuances related to psychological and contextual factors, as well as practical considerations in current entrepreneurship practices, warrant attention.\n\nEntreComp was developed using a mixed-method approach that encompassed various stages. The process was initiated by conducting a preliminary study of literature, practices, and case studies related to entrepreneurship education. This helped to gather a preliminary list of competence statements which was iteratively developed throughout consultations with experts from different fields. However, it is important to note that EntreComp was released without empirical validation or practical validation from practitioners and end-users. Despite its widespread practical use and recognition, only a few studies have critically examined the structure and contents of EntreComp in relation to the entrepreneurial competences identified in existing research. Lilleväli and Täks (2017), for example, compared EntreComp with five other competence frameworks. Their findings indicated that EntreComp exhibited a greater focus on entrepreneurship as a process compared to the other frameworks examined.\n\nThis study conducts a comprehensive review of entrepreneurial competences, utilising a systematic literature analysis encompassing 140 documents up to…",

The framework is very flexible, and it can be used or adopted in different contexts: curricula reform (adopt, design) in formal/non-formal education, practical entrepreneurial experience design, self-assessment tools of entrepreneurial proficiency measurement and monitoring, links identification with different skills, strength of team identification, and skills validation acquired from a learning experience [2,3]. The EntreComp offers an overview of interconnected and interrelated competencies that makes someone entrepreneurial (Ref. [4]) The EntreComp Framework include three competency areas: ideas and opportunities, resources, into action. Each of these areas has five competencies, detailed in Figure 1.\n\nThe network visualization of keywords on the publications was used to map topical directions in the field of EntreComp research. A total number of 193 keywords were identified from the research articles. The most frequently used keywords were entrepreneurship (13), entrepreneurship education (10), EntreComp/entrepreneurial/entrepreneurship competencie(s) (9/9), education/higher education/primary education (8/6/2), self-efficacy (5), innovation (4), enterprise/business/business dynamics (4/3/2), and gender/gender differences (3/2) (Figure 7). It can be seen that the researchers covered topics focusing on EntreComp competencies and entrepreneurship education (primary and higher) and/or enterprise/business dynamics/business takeover/business transfer. Moreover, within the figure there are clusters of keywords that are related to gender/gender differences, entrepreneurial intention, self-efficacy, attitudes, cognitive abilities, collaboration, and performance and innovation.\n\nA total of 37 documents from 71 organizations and 31 countries (collected from the WoS database, published between 2016–2022) were analyzed. The articles, the research of which mainly focus on (i) exploring the relationship between entrepreneurship competencies and entrepreneurial intention (in case of STEM students and considering gender differences) [22] or (ii) comparative analysis (in terms of aims, definitions, constructing approaches) of five entrepreneurship competencies models [23] are the most cited. The network of keywords shows that two main thematic lines of research are focusing on EntreComp competencies and education areas and/or enterprise/business areas, with lines of research showing strong links between EntreComp competencies and various study topics (entrepreneurial intention, self-efficacy, performance, innovation, skills, attitudes, gender, etc.).",

The resulting set of 12 competences constitutes building blocks of what Sustainability as a competence entails.\n\nThe European Sustainability Competence Framework – GreenComp – defines what sustainability is as a competence and how it can be developed through the educational system. The GreenComp places particular attention to the interconnected character of the 12 competence and to the need to embed sustainability skills through the lifelong learning process of an individual. The framework promotes strategies to fill the gap between theoretical knowledge and attitudes, rising awareness on the environmental challenges, encouraging systems thinking and empowering collective and individual actions. ... The European Sustainability Competence Framework, or GreenComp, is a policy action outlined in the European Green Deal, that aims to address the gaps in environmental education by identifying a set of Sustainability Competences that can be integrated into educational programs.\n\nThe acquisition of sustainability competences by learners of all ages requires a shift in the educational mindset that needs to overcome the cognitive dissonance resulting from passive acquisition of knowledge. In these terms, the GreenComp is not intended to be a prescriptive set of rules to be followed by educators and trainers, but rather a flexible and adaptable reference for learning schemes that foster sustainability as a competence. The framework identifies 4 interrelated competence areas, and for each indicates 3 key-competences, to be intended as non-hierarchical and equally important. The resulting set of 12 competences constitutes building blocks of what Sustainability as a competence entails. Embodying sustainability values: including the competences valuing sustainability, supporting fairness, and promoting nature. Embracing complexity in sustainability: including the competences systems thinking, critical thinking, and problem framing.\n\nAcquiring sustainability competences can be an opportunity to embrace alternative and innovative pedagogies that promote a holistic development of the individual. The Open Communities for Sustainable Development (OUTSIDE) is a project that promotes a sustainable entrepreneurial mindset among young students (6-11 years old) through collaboration with local entities. The GreenComp, with other EU frameworks, has been used as a reference point to map out skills acquisition among students, identifying overlapping areas and encouraging a cross-sectorial approach, resulting in guidelines for teachers and educators that wish to embed a sustainable entrepreneurship within the educational system. The project is a successful example of how sustainable competences can be developed through a cross-disciplinary approach that empowers students participation and engagement in their communities.\n\nActing for sustainability: including the competences political agency, collective action, and individual initiative. The interlinked character of sustainability as a competence requires learning environments that put in place transformative and inter-curricular pedagogies, fostering a shift towards a sustainable mindset. A common characteristic of all competences is that they aim to translate knowledge into practices, empowering learners with abilities to act upon problems and become agents of change. Research has shown that student-centered and project-based learning can strengthen critical thinking, collaboration, agency, and problem-solving skills (Edutopia, 2021). Moreover, the competences are interrelated among each other and often developed through one another. Therefore, the processes of development and acquisition greatly benefit from interdisciplinary approaches that can guide learners in understanding the interconnectedness of social, economical and natural systems.",

Grounded in the GreenComp framework and developed through a Design-Based Research approach, the game integrates location-based interaction, narrative storytelling, and multimodal augmented reality and multimedia content to activate key competences such as systems thinking, futures literacy, and sustainability-oriented action. The game was validated with 33 in-service schoolteachers, both through a simulation-based training workshop and a curricular review of the game. A mixed-methods strategy was used, combining structured questionnaires, open-ended reflections, and curricular review.

Let me create the final application package with all improvements.\n\n---\n\n# **FINAL APPLICATION PACKAGE**\n\n## **COVER LETTER**\n\nDear Hiring Committee,\n\nI am applying for the Consultant – Transformative Education role to support UNESCO Bangkok's GCED Network and Target 4.7. I specialize in turning frameworks into usable outputs—concept notes, agendas, facilitation plans, communications packages, analytical briefs, and presentations—delivered under tight timelines for international stakeholders.\n\nOver 15 years I have designed and documented learning programs across conflict-affected and multicultural contexts. Most recently, I co-developed a sustainable construction curriculum with the **International Trade Centre in Iraq** (2024–25), producing trainer guides and implementation roadmaps for 50+ stakeholders. At **Bloom** (2016-2024), the venture learning platform I co-founded, I developed wellbeing-centered methodologies including the **upside-down pyramid** (learner agency), **community check-ins** (psychological safety), and **strengths-based assessments** (resilience-building). These approaches informed 118 accelerator cycles across 16 countries—from Lebanon and Jordan to Kenya, Rwanda, and across the Gulf—and I've published on their impact, including research for the **Asfari Foundation** examining post-traumatic growth effects in social entrepreneurship programs.\n\nMy experience directly aligns with UNESCO's GCED priorities. At Bloom, our **HerMeNow program** achieved 50%+ female participation through trauma-informed, gender-responsive design in Lebanon and Jordan. I've worked extensively with **EntreComp** and **GreenComp** frameworks—both developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre alongside UNESCO's competency architectures—and understand how to bridge values-based education with assessment systems like NEQMAP. My work across Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East has taught me how to identify universal pedagogical principles while honoring cultural context—essential for fostering the \"shared sense of humanity\" central to GCED.\n\nFor UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU, I will deliver:\n\n**Webinar & meeting packages:** concept notes, agendas, run-of-show documents, slide decks, and communications materials that highlight GCED-NEQMAP synergies  \n**Concise web content:** articles (≤250 words) and country case documentation accessible to diverse audiences  \n**Analytical synthesis:** thematic reports and annual report inputs (≤7 pages) with gender-responsive, evidence-based recommendations  \n**Strategic planning:** 2026 proposal grounded in evaluation of 2025 activities, with realistic implementation and monitoring plans\n\nI am familiar with UNESCO editorial standards and UN system review processes from previous work with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français as both grantee and consultant. I understand the importance of building review buffers, maintaining change logs, and producing materials that balance analytical rigor with accessibility.\n\n**I will be available from 20 October 2025**, with flexibility for coordination calls prior to that date while concluding work in Mosul. Based in Lille, France with stable childcare, I can provide Bangkok overlap (11:00–15:00 ICT) for key calls, with consistent email responsiveness outside those hours.\n\nI am confident my research-to-practice expertise, UN consultancy familiarity, and wellbeing-centered pedagogy will deliver both quality and timeliness for this assignment. I have attached my Employment History Form, CV, work samples, and technical and financial proposals.\n\nWarm regards,  \nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\n## **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL**\n\n### **A. Understanding of the Assignment**\n\nUNESCO Bangkok seeks a consultant to strengthen the Asia-Pacific GCED Network through strategic knowledge products and communications materials across four work phases. The assignment requires balancing urgent October deliverables (webinar packages, annual meeting materials) with substantive analytical synthesis (2025 program reviews) and forward-looking planning (2026 workplan).\n\nSuccess depends on producing concise, gender-responsive materials that bridge GCED competencies with NEQMAP assessment frameworks, maintain UNESCO editorial standards, and support the network's evolution toward systemic, whole-school approaches. The consultant must work remotely with APCEIU and UNESCO Bangkok stakeholders across time zones, managing the 50-day timeline compressed into 3.5 months while allowing for multi-stakeholder review cycles.\n\n### **B. Methodological Approach**\n\nDrawing from 15 years designing learning programs in complex contexts, I will apply the following principles developed through Bloom's practice and my postgraduate research on post-traumatic growth:\n\n**Practitioner-Centered Design (Upside-Down Pyramid)**  \nAll materials will support GCED practitioners' agency and decision-making rather than being prescriptive. Concept notes and facilitation guides will provide scaffolding and options, not rigid scripts.\n\n**Community-Oriented Facilitation (Convening Circles)**  \nWebinar and meeting designs will embed reflective, collective practices—check-ins, peer exchange, collaborative sense-making—that build belonging and keep GCED people-centered.\n\n**Strengths-Based Framing**  \nAnalytical reports will amplify what's working across the network (evidence of impact, effective practices, promising innovations) while identifying opportunities for growth. This approach builds momentum and motivation rather than focusing on deficits.\n\n**Mutual Learning & Cross-Pollination**  \nMaterials will elevate case stories from diverse country contexts, enabling network members to learn from one another's experiences. Having worked across Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East, I've learned to identify pedagogical universals—the shared human needs for connection, meaning, and efficacy—while honoring how culture shapes implementation. This skill directly supports GCED's emphasis on \"shared sense of humanity\" across diverse societies.\n\n**Evidence-Informed & Gender-Responsive**  \nAll content will be grounded in UNESCO research, regional education data, and documented network experiences. Gender analysis will be explicit—highlighting women and girls in GCED examples, using inclusive language, and providing gender-disaggregated data where available. My work on Bloom's **HerMeNow program** (50%+ female participation in Lebanon/Jordan) demonstrates practical experience designing gender-responsive programming in challenging contexts.\n\n**Competency Framework Literacy**  \nWhile I have not worked specifically on GCED Network documentation, my extensive experience with **EntreComp** (entrepreneurship competencies) and **GreenComp** (sustainability competencies) provides direct transferable expertise. All three frameworks—GCED, EntreComp, and GreenComp—are part of the European Commission's competency-based learning architecture and share foundational principles:\n\n- **Structure**: All organize competencies into interrelated areas (GCED: Cognitive-Socio-emotional-Behavioural; EntreComp: Ideas-Resources-Action; GreenComp: Values-Complexity-Futures-Action)\n- **Components**: All define competence as knowledge + skills + attitudes/values, not just cognitive knowledge\n- **Orientation**: All emphasize transforming learners into active agents of change in their communities\n- **Pedagogy**: All advocate learner-centered, project-based, experiential approaches\n- **Application**: All are designed as non-prescriptive reference frameworks adaptable across formal/non-formal/informal learning contexts\n\nThe pedagogical differences are primarily domain-specific (entrepreneurship vs. sustainability vs. global citizenship) rather than structural. My fluency in translating competency frameworks into practical learning activities, assessment tools, and educator guidance directly transfers to GCED work.\n\n**AI-Augmented Workflow**  \nI use large language models as structured thinking and outlining tools to accelerate drafting—never as replacement authors. All content undergoes human review for coherence, accuracy, and UNESCO style compliance.\n\n### **C.

APCEIU, 2017, p. 18), just as mathematics teachers, for example, need to be competent\nin mathematics. Being a global citizen can thus be considered as a GCED teacher’s ‘subject-\nspecific competence’. Due to the character of GCED, this competence is to a large part\nbased on values and attitudes, though there must also be cognitive components and skills for\n(social) action.\nVarious competence frameworks for global citizenship have already been developed,\namongst others by Oxfam (2015), UNESCO (2015), OECD (Colvin and Edwards, 2018), and\nan international working group at the Brookings Institution (2017). While all these frameworks\nfocus on the school sector, the competences they specify apply to adults, including teachers,\nequally.\nAll these sources provide a quite exhaustive compendium of competence elements –\nincluding knowledge as well as skills and values/attitudes – that GCED ALE teachers are\ncalled upon to develop in themselves, besides teaching them to others.\nThe main elements of global citizenship competence which are referred to in some way in all\nthese examples include the following:\nCognitive\n• Knowledge, understanding and critical thinking about global themes and issues,\nstructures and processes and understanding their interconnectedness (power and\ngovernance, sustainable development, climate change, economic globalisation, fair\ntrade, consumerism, poverty and wealth, social justice and equity, peace and conflict,\nhuman rights issues, etc.);\n• Critical awareness of and reflection on own values and beliefs and those of others;\nunderstanding of how these value (systems) inform social and political action and\n11decision-making; understanding of difference and diversity; awareness of own identity\nand how this is situated within multiple relationships;\n• Critical information and media literacy (know where to find information, critically\nanalysing and assessing its value; understanding underlying stakeholder interests,\ncritical awareness of language use, etc.);\n• Knowledge of opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, regional, national or\nglobal level.\nBehavioural\n• Abilities for responsible and effective action at local, national and global levels for a\nmore peaceful and sustainable world (communication, cooperation, problem solving,\nconflict resolution skills; active participation in the community, engaging in civic\naction).\nSocio-emotional\n• Developing an identity as a global citizen, feeling of belonging to a common\nhumanity, appreciation of and respect for differences and diversity, developing\nempathy and solidarity with other people;\n• Commitment to universally shared values (social justice, equity, human rights, peace,\ncare for the environment/sustainable development etc.), reai believe our work on helping peopl eunderstand their why and deeply understanding the changing world around them and the challenge they see and then seeing themselves and the communiy as a source of solutions and finding international mentors from around the world to be strong because we are together touches many of these from their document: [[[Subject-specific competence (global citizenship competence)\n• Knowledge, understanding and critical thinking about global themes and issues,\nstructures and processes, and understanding their interconnectedness.\n• Critical awareness and reflection of own values and beliefs and those of others;\nunderstanding of how these value (systems) inform social and political action and\ndecision making.\n• Critical information and media literacy.\n• Abilities for responsible and effective action at local, national and global levels for a more\npeaceful and sustainable world.\n• Developing an identity as a global citizen;

While all these frameworks\nfocus on the school sector, the competences they specify apply to adults, including teachers,\nequally.\nAll these sources provide a quite exhaustive compendium of competence elements –\nincluding knowledge as well as skills and values/attitudes – that GCED ALE teachers are\ncalled upon to develop in themselves, besides teaching them to others.\nThe main elements of global citizenship competence which are referred to in some way in all\nthese examples include the following:\nCognitive\n• Knowledge, understanding and critical thinking about global themes and issues,\nstructures and processes and understanding their interconnectedness (power and\ngovernance, sustainable development, climate change, economic globalisation, fair\ntrade, consumerism, poverty and wealth, social justice and equity, peace and conflict,\nhuman rights issues, etc.);\n• Critical awareness of and reflection on own values and beliefs and those of others;\nunderstanding of how these value (systems) inform social and political action and\n11decision-making; understanding of difference and diversity; awareness of own identity\nand how this is situated within multiple relationships;\n• Critical information and media literacy (know where to find information, critically\nanalysing and assessing its value; understanding underlying stakeholder interests,\ncritical awareness of language use, etc.);\n• Knowledge of opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, regional, national or\nglobal level.\nBehavioural\n• Abilities for responsible and effective action at local, national and global levels for a\nmore peaceful and sustainable world (communication, cooperation, problem solving,\nconflict resolution skills; active participation in the community, engaging in civic\naction).\nSocio-emotional\n• Developing an identity as a global citizen, feeling of belonging to a common\nhumanity, appreciation of and respect for differences and diversity, developing\nempathy and solidarity with other people;\n• Commitment to universally shared values (social justice, equity, human rights, peace,\ncare for the environment/sustainable development etc.), reai believe our work on helping peopl eunderstand their why and deeply understanding the changing world around them and the challenge they see and then seeing themselves and the communiy as a source of solutions and finding international mentors from around the world to be strong because we are together touches many of these from their document: [[[Subject-specific competence (global citizenship competence)\n• Knowledge, understanding and critical thinking about global themes and issues,\nstructures and processes, and understanding their interconnectedness.\n• Critical awareness and reflection of own values and beliefs and those of others;\nunderstanding of how these value (systems) inform social and political action and\ndecision making.\n• Critical information and media literacy.\n• Abilities for responsible and effective action at local, national and global levels for a more\npeaceful and sustainable world.\n• Developing an identity as a global citizen;

understanding of the\nchallenges that global developments pose to the field of education (e.g. in terms of\nsupporting inclusivity and diversity in the classroom).\n• Practical ability to plan, conduct and evaluate learning activities in the field of GCED,\nincluding in particular:\no knowledge of a sufficient repertoire of different teaching and learning methods\n(with a special focus on methods associated with transformative learning and\nempowerment of learners, for example methods promoting experiential\nlearning, enquiry-based learning, project-based learning, social learning etc.);\nability to assess the potential and limitations of each method for various\nteaching/learning purposes;\no knowledge of a sufficient repertoire of assessment methods (with a special\nfocus on learner-centred methods); ability to assess the potential and limitations\nof each method for various assessment purposes;\no knowledge of didactic materials and documents; ability to select suitable\nmaterials for a given teaching or learning purpose or to create own materials;\no knowledge of suitable (social) media and ICT applications and competence in\napplying them for teaching and learning purposes in the field of GCED.\n22Professional self-awareness, values and beliefs\n• Knowledge of and embracing of andragogical principles regarding the role of teachers\nand learners.\n• Regard learners as equals and respect their autonomy and expertise.\n• Understand own role as that of a facilitator who supports and guides learning processes\nbut who, equally, learns from the students.\nContext and field competence\n• Ability to promote/ embed global citizenship and global citizenship education in own\ninstitutional or social context and among own colleagues.\n• Sound knowledge of different external (e.g. institutional) contexts that are relevant for\nown GCED-related subject.\n• Networking and cooperation – ability to establish cooperative relationships with\nstakeholders from these contexts.\n• Ability to design learning activities and learning experiences in different contexts outside\nthe classroom (including in in cooperation with external stakeholders).]]]",

Over 15 years, I've built learning programs in places where systems are broken or fragile—Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Kenya, Rwanda, Libya—and learned how to create frameworks that actually work across cultures, not just in theory.\n\nMost recently with the **International Trade Centre in Iraq** (2024-25), I co-developed sustainable construction curriculum and trainer guides for 50+ stakeholders. Before that, I spent eight years co-founding and running **Bloom**, where we designed 118 accelerator cycles across 16 countries using what we call the **upside-down pyramid**—learners in the driver's seat, not us. We built in **community check-ins** (Ubuntu: I am because we are), **strengths-based assessments**, and **collective intelligence practices** because we learned that people grow best when they grow together, especially in crisis contexts.\n\nHere's what connects to GCED: Our **HerMeNow program** brought together 100% women founders from Cameroon to Lebanon and beyond—all working on green and environmental projects. We didn't just teach about global citizenship; we created the conditions for it. Women from different countries, languages, and contexts learning to see themselves and their community as sources of solutions, supported by international mentors. That's GCED competence in practice: developing identity as global citizens, respect for diversity, commitment to sustainability, and taking action locally with global solidarity.\n\nI've worked with **EntreComp** and **GreenComp**—both competency frameworks like GCED that are containers for content rather than rigid curricula. Bloom's framework works the same way: we define core principles (agency, strengths, community, reflection), then adapt them to context. Whether it's post-conflict Iraq or economic collapse in Lebanon, the human needs are similar—connection, meaning, agency—but how you deliver it has to flex.\n\nThe October deliverables are tight, I know. I'm wrapping up in Mosul on October 17, and starting immediately on the 20th will be a sprint. But I've done this before—produced concept notes, agendas, slide decks, and web articles under pressure for UN agencies, foundations, and governments. I understand UNESCO's review cycles and how to build buffer time for feedback.\n\nFor this assignment, I'll deliver:\n- **Webinar and meeting packages** (concept notes, agendas, run-of-show, slides, comms)\n- **Web articles** (≤250 words) and country case documentation\n- **Analytical reports** (≤7 pages) with gender-responsive recommendations\n- **2026 planning** (workplan + evaluation)\n\nI'm based in Lille with stable childcare. I can overlap with Bangkok time (11am-3pm ICT) for calls and stay responsive via email. I've worked with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français before, so I know the editorial standards and coordination processes.\n\nI'm confident I can deliver quality work on time. My CV, work samples, and technical/financial proposals are attached.\n\nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\n## **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL (Direct Version)**\n\n### **A. Understanding the Assignment**\n\nUNESCO Bangkok needs someone to produce GCED knowledge products fast—webinar packages by early November, annual meeting materials before December 5, web articles and reports through February. The content has to be concise, gender-responsive, and bridge GCED competencies with NEQMAP assessment frameworks. You need materials that work for practitioners across the Asia-Pacific region, which means balancing analytical depth with accessibility.\n\nThe 50-day timeline compressed into 3.5 months is aggressive. It requires front-loading October deliverables while building in UNESCO's review cycles (3-5 days per round). I've structured the workplan accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **B. How I Work: Methodology Grounded in Practice**\n\n**First: I practice what GCED teaches**\n\nThe APCEIU document you referenced says GCED teachers need to be competent in global citizenship themselves—just like math teachers need to know math. I agree. You can't teach empathy, critical thinking, or global solidarity from a textbook.\n\nHere's how Bloom's work connects to GCED's core competencies:\n\n**Global citizenship identity & respect for diversity:**  \nOur **HerMeNow program** was 100% women founders from Cameroon, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Kenya, and beyond—all working on environmental and green projects. We didn't lecture them about appreciating diversity. We put them in a cohort together, facilitated peer learning circles, and watched them build genuine solidarity across language and cultural barriers. That's GCED in action: feeling of belonging to common humanity, respect for differences, empathy and solidarity with others.\n\n**Critical thinking about global issues:**  \nWe help people understand their \"why\"—the problem they see in the world and why they care about solving it. Then we help them see themselves and their community as sources of solutions, not just victims of global forces. Whether it's climate change, economic inequality, or post-conflict recovery, we teach people to think critically about systems and their role in them.\n\n**Responsible action for a more peaceful and sustainable world:**  \nEvery Bloom program connects learners to international mentors—people from other countries and contexts who share their expertise. We use Ubuntu as a guiding principle: **we are strong because we are together**. This isn't fluffy language for us; it's how the programs are structured. Peer learning, community check-ins, collaborative problem-solving. People take action locally but learn globally.\n\n**The framework as container, not curriculum:**  \nGCED is a framework that content gets placed within, not a fixed curriculum. Same with Bloom's approach. We define core principles—**learner agency (upside-down pyramid), strengths-based growth, community-first design, reflection and action**—then adapt them to context. A refugee youth program in Jordan looks different from a corporate innovation program in Dubai, but the underlying pedagogy is the same.\n\n**Second: Practical methods I'll use for this assignment**\n\n**Upside-Down Pyramid (Learner Agency):**  \nAll materials will put GCED practitioners in the driver's seat. Concept notes and facilitation guides will offer options and scaffolding, not prescriptive scripts.\n\n**Community Check-Ins (Convening Circles):**  \nWebinar and meeting designs will include reflective practices—check-ins, peer exchange, collaborative sense-making—to build belonging and keep people centered.\n\n**Strengths-Based Framing:**  \nReports will highlight what's working across the network before identifying gaps. This builds momentum and avoids deficit thinking.\n\n**Cross-Cultural Fluency:**  \nI've worked across Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Gulf. I know how to identify universal pedagogical needs (connection, meaning, efficacy) while respecting how culture shapes implementation. For GCED materials serving Asia-Pacific, I'll prioritize clarity over jargon and elevate diverse country examples.\n\n**Gender Lens:**  \nAll materials will foreground women and girls, use inclusive language, and provide gender-disaggregated data where available. HerMeNow taught me how to design truly gender-responsive programs, not just add a gender paragraph to existing content.\n\n**Evidence-Based but Accessible:**  \nI'll ground everything in UNESCO research and regional education data, but write for practitioners. Footnotes yes, academic jargon no.\n\n**Third: Competency framework fluency (EntreComp, GreenComp, GCED)**\n\nWhile I haven't worked on GCED Network documentation specifically, I've worked extensively with **EntreComp** (entrepreneurship competencies) and **GreenComp** (sustainability competencies)—both European Commission frameworks similar to GCED. All three frameworks:\n- Organize competencies into interrelated areas (not linear lists)\n- Define competence as knowledge + skills + values, not just cognitive content\n- Emphasize transforming learners into active agents of change\n- Are designed as flexible containers that adapt to context, not rigid curricula\n\nThe main difference is domain (entrepreneurship vs. sustainability vs. global citizenship), not structure or pedagogy. I know how to translate frameworks into learning activities, assessment tools, and educator guidance. That transfers directly.\n\n---\n\n### **C.

Here’s the tight review and then a merged, submission-ready version in your voice.\n\n5 pros (of your Direct Versions)\n\nAuthentic voice: clear, human, specific; no corporate fog.\n\nGCED competence “lived,” not claimed: HerMeNow + Ubuntu make it real.\n\nConcrete places & numbers: Mosul, 50+ stakeholders, 118 cycles—credible.\n\nFrameworks as containers: crisp bridge from GCED ↔ EntreComp/GreenComp ↔ your method.\n\nOctober realism: you name the sprint and show a workable plan.\n\n5 cons (opportunities to tighten)\n\nSlight length & repetition: the same points reappear (framework container, regions).\n\nList density: several long lists; could scan faster with fewer bullets.\n\nOne “show, don’t tell” gap: add a micro-example of a GCED activity you run (prompt → action).\n\nSamples buried: call out the #1 sample you want opened first.\n\nInstallments rationale: state why 40/30/30 (front-loaded work) in one line.\n\nMerged, final drafts (clean, direct, no AI tells)\nCover Letter (final)\n\nDear Hiring Committee,\n\nI’m applying for the Consultant – Transformative Education role with UNESCO Bangkok’s GCED Network.\n\nFor 15 years I’ve built learning programs where systems are fragile—Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Kenya, Rwanda, Libya—and learned how to make frameworks travel across cultures. With the International Trade Centre in Iraq (2024–25) I co-developed a sustainable construction curriculum and delivered trainer guides and handover materials for 50+ stakeholders. Before that, at Bloom, I led 118 accelerator cycles in 16 countries using three anchors: upside-down pyramid (learner agency), community check-ins (psychological safety), and strengths-based assessment.\n\nWhat this means for GCED: our women-only HerMeNow program brought founders from Cameroon to Lebanon together around green ventures. We didn’t just talk global citizenship—we practiced it: peers from different languages and contexts solving problems together, supported by international mentors. That’s GCED competence in action—identity, empathy, respect for diversity, and local action linked to global solidarity.\n\nI’ve worked with EntreComp and GreenComp and treat GCED the same way: a container for content, not a script. The principles stay (agency, strengths, community, reflection); the delivery flexes to context.\n\nOctober will be a sprint. I wrap in Mosul on Oct 17 and start on Oct 20. I’ve shipped concept notes, agendas, slide decks, and web pieces under UN timelines before and know how to build feedback buffers. I’m based in Lille with stable childcare and can overlap 11:00–15:00 Bangkok for calls.\n\nI’ll deliver:\n\nWebinar & meeting packages (concepts, agendas, run-of-show, slides, comms)\n\nShort web articles (≤250 words) and country notes\n\nConcise analytical inputs (≤7 pages) with a gender lens\n\nA practical 2026 plan (priorities, indicators, evaluation)\n\nCV, work samples, and technical/financial proposals are attached.\n\nWarm regards,\nBilal Ghalib\n\nTechnical Proposal (Approach & Method)\nA. What you need\n\nShip fast, publishable GCED materials: webinar kits by early Nov, annual-meeting packs before Dec 5, short web pieces, concise reports, and a 2026 proposal—clear, gender-responsive, in UNESCO style, and usable by busy practitioners across Asia-Pacific.\n\nB. How I’ll work (grounded, not jargony)\n\nPractitioner-first: scaffolds and options, not scripts.\n\nCheck-ins & peer exchange: brief rituals that build trust and surface diverse views.\n\nStrengths-based: start with what’s working; scale it.\n\nGCED competence in practice: each activity includes (1) a reflective prompt on identity/bias or media literacy, (2) a cross-context peer touch, (3) one local action step.\n\nFramework fluency: translate GCED with patterns I’ve used in EntreComp/GreenComp into tasks and light assessment.\n\nEvidence + clarity: footnotes/links; plain language; two tracked-changes rounds; change log kept.\n\nNo AI tells: short sentences, specific nouns, zero filler.\n\nMicro-example we’ll reuse:\n“Three-Voices” (15 min): 1) Personal view on a global issue (90s). 2) Partner’s view from another context (90s). 3) Shared one-sentence action they can take this month.

I'll incorporate all your points:\n\n---\n\n## **COVER LETTER**\n\nDear Hiring Committee,\n\nI'm applying for the Consultant – Transformative Education role with UNESCO Bangkok's GCED Network.\n\nFor 15 years I've built learning programs where systems are fragile or broken—Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Kenya, Rwanda, Libya. With the **International Trade Centre in Iraq** (2024-25) I co-developed sustainable construction curriculum and delivered trainer guides for 50+ stakeholders. Before that at **Bloom**, I led 118 accelerator cycles across 16 countries using three anchors: upside-down pyramid (learner agency), community check-ins (Ubuntu: we are strong because we are together), and strengths-based assessment.\n\n**Here's what connects to GCED:**\n\nOur **HerMeNow program** was 100% women founders—from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya—all working on green and environmental ventures. We didn't lecture about global citizenship. We built the conditions for it: women from different languages and contexts solving problems together, supported by international mentors from Silicon Valley to the region. Many of those mentors today are former Bloom participants from 10 years ago. That network—bridging technology partners across borders, building relationships that last—is how you build global citizenship competence: identity, empathy, respect for diversity, local action linked to global solidarity.\n\nUNESCO says GCED is \"not a single subject with a set curriculum but rather a framework, a prism through which education is considered.\" That's exactly how we work. Bloom's methodology is a container: the principles stay (agency, strengths, community, reflection), but the content and delivery flex to context. We haven't used GCED specifically, but our approach aligns well with the framework. We help people understand their why—the challenge they see in the world—then see themselves and their community as sources of solutions. That builds the cognitive (critical thinking about global issues), socio-emotional (empathy, belonging to common humanity), and behavioral (responsible action) competencies GCED describes.\n\nI've also worked with **EntreComp** and **GreenComp**—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED. I know how to translate competency frameworks into activities, assessment tools, and educator guidance.\n\n**October will be tight.** I wrap in Mosul on Oct 17 and start Oct 20. I've shipped concept notes, agendas, slide decks, and web pieces under UN timelines before and know how to build feedback buffers. I'm based in Lille with stable childcare and can overlap 11:00-15:00 Bangkok for calls.\n\nI'll deliver:\n- Webinar & meeting packages (concepts, agendas, run-of-show, slides, comms)\n- Short web articles (≤250 words) and country notes\n- Analytical reports (≤7 pages) with a gender lens\n- A practical 2026 plan\n\nCV, work samples, and proposals attached.\n\nWarm regards,  \nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\n## **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL**\n\n### **A. What you need**\n\nFast, publishable GCED materials: webinar kits by early Nov, annual meeting packages before Dec 5, web pieces, reports, and a 2026 proposal—clear, gender-responsive, UNESCO style, usable by practitioners across Asia-Pacific.\n\n---\n\n### **B. How I work**\n\n**First: I live what GCED teaches**\n\nAPCEIU says GCED teachers need to be competent in global citizenship themselves—like math teachers need to know math. I agree. Here's how Bloom's work maps to GCED's subject-specific competencies:\n\n**Knowledge & critical thinking about global issues:**  \nWe help people understand their why—the problem they see in the world and why they care. Then we help them see themselves and their community as sources of solutions. Whether it's climate change, economic inequality, or post-conflict recovery, we teach systems thinking and agency.\n\n**Identity as a global citizen + respect for diversity:**  \nHerMeNow was 100% women founders from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya—all working on green ventures. We didn't talk about global citizenship; we created it. Women from different languages and contexts learning together, supported by international mentors. That network—Silicon Valley to regional partners, many of whom are former Bloom participants from 10 years ago—builds genuine solidarity across borders. That's GCED: belonging to common humanity, appreciation of differences, empathy.\n\n**Commitment to shared values + action:**  \nEvery Bloom program connects learners to mentors across borders. We use Ubuntu: we are strong because we are together. Community check-ins, peer learning, collaborative problem-solving. People take local action with global support.\n\n**UNESCO says GCED is \"not a single subject with a set curriculum but rather a framework, a prism through which education is considered.\"**\n\nThat's exactly how Bloom works. Our methodology is a container: the principles stay (upside-down pyramid for agency, strengths-based growth, community-first design, reflection and action), but the content flexes to context. A refugee youth program in Jordan looks different from a corporate program in Dubai, but the pedagogy is the same.\n\n**We haven't worked on GCED specifically, but Bloom's methodology aligns well with the framework.** Both emphasize:\n- Learner agency over prescription\n- Values + skills + knowledge, not just cognitive content\n- Transforming learners into active change agents\n- Adapting to context while holding core principles\n\nI've worked with **EntreComp** (entrepreneurship) and **GreenComp** (sustainability)—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED. I know how to translate frameworks into activities and guidance.\n\n---\n\n**Second: Practical methods for this assignment**\n\n**Upside-down pyramid:** Materials put practitioners in charge—options and scaffolds, not scripts.\n\n**Community rituals:** Webinar designs include check-ins, peer exchange, collaborative sense-making to build trust.\n\n**Strengths-based:** Reports start with what's working, then identify opportunities.\n\n**GCED in every activity:** Each session includes (1) reflective prompt on identity/bias/media literacy, (2) cross-context peer touch, (3) one local action step. Hits cognitive, socio-emotional, behavioral.\n\n**Gender lens:** Foreground women and girls, inclusive language, gender-disaggregated data.\n\n**Evidence + clarity:** UNESCO research, regional data, plain language, footnoted sources.\n\n**Example we'll reuse:**  \n\"Three Voices\" (15 min): 1) Your view on a global issue (90s). 2) Partner's view from another context (90s). 3) One action you can both take this month (one sentence). Captures cognitive (framing), socio-emotional (empathy), behavioral (action).\n\n---\n\n### **C.

Some people are getting great results, and some find LLMs, like chatGPT, fun yet\r\nuseless for “the real world of work.” The opportunity is there, yet it requires us to learn how LLMs work, and from there, we will be able to\r\nget better results.\r\nThis framework will allow you to use chatGPT and other LLMs to help you think. We developed these principles to help you experience\r\nthis intuition about how LLMs operate and teach yourself the things you don’t even know. By using this tool well, you can benefit\r\nyourself, your communities, and the world.\r\nIn a nutshell, LLMs store knowledge in a graph representing ideas in space. By speaking to it, you move around in this graph. Once you’re\r\nsomewhere in the graph, you can ask what is around you that you “can’t see.”\r\nThe S.C.R.I.B.E.R Framework for Prompting\r\n● Seek: Exploring your gaps in different domains of knowledge.\r\n● Critique: Actively seek constructive critique from antagonist personas.\r\n● Reflect: Procedurally review the LLM’s work and create tools with which to think.\r\n● Inquire: Ask the AI to ask you questions to help it navigate to new spaces.\r\n● Broaden/Contract: Seek gaps, ask the LLM for non-overlapping options, and pick.\r\n● Explain: Ask LLM to share its reasoning for transparency and corrections.\r\n● Recurse: Ask the LLM to ask it to ask you.\r\nPage 7 of 17",

It focuses on two core pillars:\r\n1. The Individual: Featuring Wellbeing and Engagement (PERMAH), Universal\r\nSkills, Character Strengths, and Entrepreneurship & Leadership Skills\r\nAssessments.\r\n2. The Organization: Featuring the Organizational Development Assessment.\r\nThe framework helps assess core strengths and weaknesses, prioritizing areas for\r\nlearning and development. Our goal is to simplify the creation of custom learning\r\njourneys, enabling teams and program managers to identify optimal learning\r\nopportunities, foster a supportive environment, and positively impact businesses.\r\nThe Bloom platform provides guidance and suggested activities for improvement\r\nacross both pillars, ensuring simultaneous development and, for example, improving an\r\nindividual's skill through activities that address core organizational needs.\r\nEntrepreneurs identify their priority development areas based on assessment results\r\nand customize their learning journey with program managers, co-creating a tailored\r\ncurriculum for the cohort.\r\nOur framework is based on proven cohort-based and project-based learning methods\r\ncombined with the power of mentorship. Peer learning enhances the experience, while\r\nproject-based learning aligns objectives with a mission or vision, fostering intrinsic\r\nmotivation. Using a flipped classroom approach, entrepreneurs first digest relevant\r\ncontent, reflect on their learnings, and apply them in their enterprises. They then meet\r\nwith their cohort for peer feedback and mentorship, using what they learn in real-life\r\nsettings.\r\nOur programs nurture individual and organizational development, promoting\r\ncooperation over competition and leveraging collective intelligence to solve pressing\r\nsocietal problems.\r\nThe Bloom Training Framework is versatile and can be used in various contexts,\r\nincluding companies, educational programs (youth, school, university), startup\r\naccelerators, and short events like startup sprints or hackathons.\r\nOur Principles\r\nWe use the following guiding principles to evaluate and prioritize program activities:\r\n1.

To do this, we must know ourselves, our abilities, our limits and finally we\r\nmust know where we want to go and have some idea how to get there. This is the crux of the problem, in much of the world education is\r\nlackluster, and mentorship is lacking, and having a sense of where to go next is next to impossible without exposure and support. We\r\nbelieve generative AI can solve this problem, or make it worse.\r\nFor nearly a decade I’ve been building systems to help people learn about knowledge landscapes through educational assessments and\r\noffering learning activities based on results. While this is marginally better than giving someone access to wikipedia and suggestions they\r\n“google it” - it’s missing a crucial element. A database model of education doesn’t have the ability to support goal reflection and\r\narticulation, doesn’t know your blindspots, can’t explain things walking backward from where you want to go and making analogies to\r\nyour your current level of knowledge. These new affordances, and many others, are now made possible with Large Language\r\nModels(LLMs).\r\nLLMs can transform education along the same vector previous technologies have, making it more accessable, personalized and relational.\r\nIn the Middle Ages, a prince may have had a tutor, in the Industrial Era the printing press made books accessible to those with disposable\r\nincome, later cultural innovations like the Public Library brought access to more people, the internet brought searchability with database\r\nqueries, Wikipedia, Brilliant and youtube brought multi-modal and social learning to our pockets. LLMs can be the next step. Right now the\r\ninternet is full of knowledge waiting to become relevant, except the person who needs it best might not know what to search for and no database will\r\nhelp. We need conversation and adaptive learning directionality, things LLMs can bring to the table.\r\nThe Ethics of LLMs and Agency - To have or to be\r\n{“role”: “system”, “content”: “You are a helpful assistant.”} is often seen as the first system prompt suggested, and has been said to be unneeded at this\r\npoint as the machines have interanlized their helpful assistant role during the instruction fine tuning moment.

We list some later in this\r\nguide, but discussing them while building and designing your program is also helpful.\r\nThe accelerator program work plan will set the tone for program results. Each objective\r\nset is measurable and timely and allows for a quantifiable measurement of success.\r\nAdditionally, impact metrics can be measured depending on the program objectives,\r\nincluding but not limited to jobs created, revenues generated, new product launches,\r\nand more.\r\nProgram Communications\r\nDeveloping a solid brand is critical in attracting enterprises and other stakeholders.\r\nChoosing the best enterprises will lead to good results, attract good investors, and\r\nreliable applications. Targeted marketing and clear communication about the\r\nprogram’s criteria, what it offers, and to whom is critical. Creating a content strategy\r\nshould be the first step.\r\nA content strategy is a plan of action purposely designed to guide content marketing\r\nactivities and ensure they deliver against a specific objective. It includes content\r\nplanning, production, publishing, promoting, tracking, and SEO optimization. It also\r\nconsists of content you produce, such as videos, blog posts, podcasts, and social media\r\nposts.\r\nYou can see a sample content plan here: HerMeNow Communications Plan (draft)\r\nSample draft posts for this campaign here: HerMeNow posts\r\nThe idea is to ensure that each piece of content you produce resonates heavily with\r\nyour target audience and serves to rally people behind your program’s objectives.\r\nSome questions to consider at this stage:\r\n1. Which channels or events would be relevant for marketing your particular\r\nprogram?\r\n2. Which networks would be most effective for reaching the type of enterprises\r\nyou’d like to work with?\r\n3.

            "text": "Perfect! I found the exact UNESCO language. Now let me rebuild this in your voice—direct, clear, using their exact terms about frameworks. I'll incorporate all your points:\n\n---\n\n## **COVER LETTER**\n\nDear Hiring Committee,\n\nI'm applying for the Consultant – Transformative Education role with UNESCO Bangkok's GCED Network.\n\nFor 15 years I've built learning programs where systems are fragile or broken—Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Kenya, Rwanda, Libya. With the **International Trade Centre in Iraq** (2024-25) I co-developed sustainable construction curriculum and delivered trainer guides for 50+ stakeholders. Before that at **Bloom**, I led 118 accelerator cycles across 16 countries using three anchors: upside-down pyramid (learner agency), community check-ins (Ubuntu: we are strong because we are together), and strengths-based assessment.\n\n**Here's what connects to GCED:**\n\nOur **HerMeNow program** was 100% women founders—from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya—all working on green and environmental ventures. We didn't lecture about global citizenship. We built the conditions for it: women from different languages and contexts solving problems together, supported by international mentors from Silicon Valley to the region. Many of those mentors today are former Bloom participants from 10 years ago. That network—bridging technology partners across borders, building relationships that last—is how you build global citizenship competence: identity, empathy, respect for diversity, local action linked to global solidarity.\n\nUNESCO says GCED is \"not a single subject with a set curriculum but rather a framework, a prism through which education is considered.\" That's exactly how we work. Bloom's methodology is a container: the principles stay (agency, strengths, community, reflection), but the content and delivery flex to context. We haven't used GCED specifically, but our approach aligns well with the framework. We help people understand their why—the challenge they see in the world—then see themselves and their community as sources of solutions. That builds the cognitive (critical thinking about global issues), socio-emotional (empathy, belonging to common humanity), and behavioral (responsible action) competencies GCED describes.\n\nI've also worked with **EntreComp** and **GreenComp**—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED. I know how to translate competency frameworks into activities, assessment tools, and educator guidance.\n\n**October will be tight.** I wrap in Mosul on Oct 17 and start Oct 20. I've shipped concept notes, agendas, slide decks, and web pieces under UN timelines before and know how to build feedback buffers. I'm based in Lille with stable childcare and can overlap 11:00-15:00 Bangkok for calls.\n\nI'll deliver:\n- Webinar & meeting packages (concepts, agendas, run-of-show, slides, comms)\n- Short web articles (≤250 words) and country notes\n- Analytical reports (≤7 pages) with a gender lens\n- A practical 2026 plan\n\nCV, work samples, and proposals attached.\n\nWarm regards,  \nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\n## **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL**\n\n### **A. What you need**\n\nFast, publishable GCED materials: webinar kits by early Nov, annual meeting packages before Dec 5, web pieces, reports, and a 2026 proposal—clear, gender-responsive, UNESCO style, usable by practitioners across Asia-Pacific.\n\n---\n\n### **B. How I work**\n\n**First: I live what GCED teaches**\n\nAPCEIU says GCED teachers need to be competent in global citizenship themselves—like math teachers need to know math. I agree. Here's how Bloom's work maps to GCED's subject-specific competencies:\n\n**Knowledge & critical thinking about global issues:**  \nWe help people understand their why—the problem they see in the world and why they care. Then we help them see themselves and their community as sources of solutions. Whether it's climate change, economic inequality, or post-conflict recovery, we teach systems thinking and agency.\n\n**Identity as a global citizen + respect for diversity:**  \nHerMeNow was 100% women founders from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya—all working on green ventures. We didn't talk about global citizenship; we created it. Women from different languages and contexts learning together, supported by international mentors. That network—Silicon Valley to regional partners, many of whom are former Bloom participants from 10 years ago—builds genuine solidarity across borders. That's GCED: belonging to common humanity, appreciation of differences, empathy.\n\n**Commitment to shared values + action:**  \nEvery Bloom program connects learners to mentors across borders. We use Ubuntu: we are strong because we are together. Community check-ins, peer learning, collaborative problem-solving. People take local action with global support.\n\n**UNESCO says GCED is \"not a single subject with a set curriculum but rather a framework, a prism through which education is considered.\"**\n\nThat's exactly how Bloom works. Our methodology is a container: the principles stay (upside-down pyramid for agency, strengths-based growth, community-first design, reflection and action), but the content flexes to context. A refugee youth program in Jordan looks different from a corporate program in Dubai, but the pedagogy is the same.\n\n**We haven't worked on GCED specifically, but Bloom's methodology aligns well with the framework.** Both emphasize:\n- Learner agency over prescription\n- Values + skills + knowledge, not just cognitive content\n- Transforming learners into active change agents\n- Adapting to context while holding core principles\n\nI've worked with **EntreComp** (entrepreneurship) and **GreenComp** (sustainability)—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED. I know how to translate frameworks into activities and guidance.\n\n---\n\n**Second: Practical methods for this assignment**\n\n**Upside-down pyramid:** Materials put practitioners in charge—options and scaffolds, not scripts.\n\n**Community rituals:** Webinar designs include check-ins, peer exchange, collaborative sense-making to build trust.\n\n**Strengths-based:** Reports start with what's working, then identify opportunities.\n\n**GCED in every activity:** Each session includes (1) reflective prompt on identity/bias/media literacy, (2) cross-context peer touch, (3) one local action step. Hits cognitive, socio-emotional, behavioral.\n\n**Gender lens:** Foreground women and girls, inclusive language, gender-disaggregated data.\n\n**Evidence + clarity:** UNESCO research, regional data, plain language, footnoted sources.\n\n**Example we'll reuse:**  \n\"Three Voices\" (15 min): 1) Your view on a global issue (90s). 2) Partner's view from another context (90s). 3) One action you can both take this month (one sentence). Captures cognitive (framing), socio-emotional (empathy), behavioral (action).\n\n---\n\n### **C. Timeline (Oct 20 start; Days 1-3 light onboarding)**\n\n**Oct 20-23 – Prep (3 days)**  \nDesk review (GCED/NEQMAP/APCEIU), alignment call, style guide.\n\n**Oct 24-Nov 15 – October sprint (18 days)**\n- 1.1 Webinar kit: Draft 24-28 → Submit 29 → Final Nov 4\n- 1.2 Announcements + country notes: Draft 30-Nov 3 → Submit Nov 4 → Final Nov 8\n- 1.3 Annual meeting package: Draft 5-11 → Submit 11 → Final Nov 15\n\n**Nov 18-Dec 5 – Web + inputs (11 days)**\n- 2.1 Web pieces: Draft 18-21 → Submit 22 → Final Nov 26\n- 2.2 Annual report inputs: Draft 25-Dec 1 → Submit Dec 1 → Final Dec 5\n\n**Dec 9-20 – Synthesis (10 days)**\n- 3.1 PowerPoint: Draft 9-12 → Submit 13 → Final Dec 17\n- 3.2 Thematic brief: Draft 16-18 → Submit 18 → Final Dec 20\n\n**Jan 23-Feb 20 – Forward plan (8 days)**\n- 4.1 & 4.2 Proposal + evaluation: Draft 23-Feb 5 → Submit Feb 6 → Final Feb 20\n\n**Total: 50 days**  \nEach has 3-5 day review buffer. I'll flag if reviews run longer.\n\n---\n\n### **D. Quality**\n\nUNESCO style, Word/PPTX (+PDF), slides with notes, inclusive language and imagery, gender data, clean version control.\n\n---\n\n## **FINANCIAL PROPOSAL**\n\n**Rate:** USD 500/day (flexible to 450-475 if scope held constant)  \n**Days:** 50 → **Total: USD 25,000**\n\n**Payments (front-loaded because October is delivery-heavy):**\n- 40% ($10,000) on signature\n- 30% ($7,500) after Dec 20 acceptance\n- 30% ($7,500) after Feb 20 acceptance\n\n**Travel:** If requested, economy + DSA per UN rules (otherwise home-based, Lille)\n\n---\n\n## **WORK SAMPLES**\n\n**Lead with #1 – open this first:**\n\n**1. Bloom Program Management Guide (excerpt, 6 pp.)** – facilitation design, agendas, run-of-show. Relevant for webinar kits (1.1), meeting materials (1.3), PowerPoint (3.1).\n\n**2.

Familiar with UN editorial standards, review cycles, multi-stakeholder coordination. My EntreComp and GreenComp experience transfers directly to GCED.\n\n---\n\n**Available October 20, 2025. Can do calls Oct 12-19 while wrapping in Mosul.**\n\n---\n\n**Quick final checks for you:**\n\n1. Which two countries for October country notes?\n2. Ok to include one Arabic paragraph under each web piece as sidebar?\n3. Any blackout times Oct 24-Nov 15 we must avoid for reviews?\n4. Sample order ok? (Program Guide first, then research, then article)\n5. Rate flexibility—prefer 500, but can go 450-475 if needed?\n\n---\n\nThere. Uses UNESCO's exact language (\"not a single subject...prism through which education\"), your direct voice, 100% women for HerMeNow, emphasis on international mentors and former participants, and connects Bloom's methodology explicitly to GCED competencies.

With the UN's International Trade Centre in Iraq (2024-25) I co-developed a sustainable construction curriculum and delivered trainer guides for 50+ stakeholders. At Bloom, I have been developing our pedagogy and facilitated a third of our 118 accelerator cycles with 1,011 teams, across 16 countries. We have been focusing on three methods: upside-down pyramid (learner agency), community check-ins (Ubuntu: we are strong because we are together), and strengths-based assessment and accompanying developmental activity libraries.\nGCED Connections:\nOur HerMeNow program was 100% women founders, from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya, all working on green and environmental ventures. Global citizenship has been a core part of our methodological pedagogy, with each cohort bridging across multiple countries and developing implicit competencies. We created the conditions for it: women from diverse languages and contexts collaborating to solve problems together, supported by international mentors from Silicon Valley to the region. Many of those mentors today are former Bloom participants from 10 years ago. That network bridging technology partners across borders, building relationships that last, is how you build global citizenship competence: identity, empathy, respect for diversity, local action linked to global solidarity.\nUNESCO says GCED is “not a single subject with a set curriculum but rather a framework, a prism through which education is considered.” And this is how we see Bloom’s methodology - as a container: the principles remain (agency, strengths, community, reflection), but the content and delivery adapt to the context. While not previously commissioned on GCED documentation, my methods and outputs align with GCED practice and the Bloom approach aligns well with the framework. We help people understand their “why”, the challenge they see in the world, and then see themselves and their community as sources of solutions. This builds the cognitive (critical thinking about global issues), socio-emotional (empathy, belonging to a common humanity), and behavioral (responsible action) competencies that GCED describes. Social enterprise training is an aligned vehicle for GCED.\nI’ve also worked with EntreComp and GreenComp—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED. I know how to translate competency frameworks into activities, assessment tools, and guidance for educators. My most recent project has been developing training for trainers to support educators.\nMy current contract with the ITC ends mid october and I wrap up in Mosul on Oct 17 and I can start then. I’ve shipped concept notes, agendas, slide decks, and web pieces under UN timelines before and know how to build feedback buffers. I’m based in Lille with can overlap with calls from +-2 hours 11:00-15:00 Bangkok time.\nI’ll deliver:\nWebinar & meeting packages (concepts, agendas, run-of-show, slides, comms)\nShort web articles (≤250 words) and country notes\nAnalytical reports (≤7 pages) with a gender lens\nA practical 2026 plan\nCV, work samples, and proposals attached.\nWarm regards,  \nBilal Ghalib\n\n\nAPPROACH & METHODOLOGY\n\nTECHNICAL PROPOSAL\n\nA. What you need\nFast, publishable GCED materials: webinar kits by early Nov, annual meeting packages before Dec 5, web pieces, reports, and a 2026 proposal, clear, gender-responsive, UNESCO style, usable by practitioners across Asia-Pacific.\n\nB. How I work\n\nFirst: Education is transmitted from the inside out\nAPCEIU says GCED teachers need to be competent in global citizenship themselves and as someone who lives in France, grew up in the US, and works in SWANA building alliances across borders I couldn’t agree more. Here’s how Bloom’s work maps to GCED’s subject-specific competencies:\n\nKnowledge & critical thinking about global issues:\nWe help people understand their deeper “why”, the problem they see in the world and why they care. Then we help them see themselves and their community as sources of solutions. Whether it’s climate change, economic inequality, or post-conflict recovery, we teach systems thinking and agency. In our programs we teach collective intelligence where people from Kenya think with teams in Lebanon about new ways to address their core why.\n\nIdentity as a global citizen + respect for diversity:\nHerMeNow was a women-only cohort with cross-country participation program for founders from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya, all working on green ventures. We build a community of interconnected global citizens, an experience visible during our retreat with strong bonds and new cooperations building across the teams. Women from different languages and contexts were learning together, supported by international mentors. That network, from Silicon Valley to regional partners, many of whom are former Bloom participants from 10 years ago, builds genuine solidarity across borders. That’s GCED: belonging to common humanity, appreciation of differences, empathy.\n\nCommitment to shared values + action:\nEvery Bloom program connects learners to mentors across borders. We use Ubuntu as one of our guiding grameworks: we are strong because we are together. Community check-ins, peer learning, collaborative problem-solving. People take local action with global support.\n\nUNESCO says GCED is “not a single subject with a set curriculum but rather a framework, a prism through which education is considered.”\n\nMy work was to design a methodology that acts like that prism, building a space for the emergence of those values which you can see described in our facilitation guide attached. The principles that are constent across our programming: upside-down pyramid question rubric for agency, strengths-based growth, community-first design, reflection and action, but the content flexes to context. A refugee youth program in Jordan looks different from a corporate program in Dubai, but the pedagogy is the same. And I’m ready to learn and adapt to the context in S.E Asia.\n\nBloom’s methodology aligns well with the GCED framework. \nLearner agency over prescription\nValues + skills + knowledge, not just cognitive content\nTransforming learners into active change agents\nAdapting to context while holding core principles\n\nI’ve worked with EntreComp (entrepreneurship) and GreenComp (sustainability)—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED. And with a masters in Learning Sciences and experience with the UN, I know how to translate frameworks into activities and guidance.\n\n\nSecond: Practical methods for this assignment\n\nUpside-down pyramid: The first person to answer is the question asker, then the collective cohort, then finally the “trainers”. Emphasizing agency and community.\n\nCommunity rituals: Webinar designs include check-ins, peer exchange, collaborative sense-making to build trust.\n\nStrengths-based: Reports start with what’s working, then identify opportunities for development.\n\nGCED in every activity: Each session can include (1) reflective prompt on identity/bias/media literacy, (2) cross-context peer touch, (3) one local action step. Hits cognitive, socio-emotional, behavioral.\n\nGender lens: Structural changes in the design of programs (remote first, female facilitated, and even women only programs) helps foreground women and girls, using inclusive language, gender-disaggregated data.\n\nEvidence + clarity: UNESCO research, regional data, plain language, footnoted sources.\n\nExample we’ll reuse:  \n“Three Voices” (15 min): 1) Your view on a global issue (90s). 2) Partner’s view from another context (90s). 3) One action you can both take this month (one sentence). Captures cognitive (framing), socio-emotional (empathy), behavioral (action).\n\n\nC.

They want to know where to put the work samples info (the 6pp excerpt, PTG/Asfari, Wamda article).\n\n4.

I think they want me to either:\na) Explain it better\nb) Remove it if it doesn't make sense\nc) Make it clearer\n\nLooking at their document, they DO have a version of \"Three Voices\" in there, but it's not clear. Let me clarify:\n\nThe \"Three Voices\" thing was an example I created to show what a GCED activity looks like in practice - something concrete they could point to. But if they don't understand it or don't use this method, we should remove it or replace it with something they actually do.\n\nFor the work samples placement - they have them at the end under \"PAST WORK OR REPORTS/PUBLICATIONS\" but the formatting could be clearer.\n\nLet me rewrite this to:\n1. Remove or clarify the Three Voices example (I'll ask them if they use this method or replace with something they do)\n\n\n2. I'll refine the work samples section to improve clarity and professional presentation. I'll ensure the Wamda article, PTG/Asfari excerpt, and 6-page document are formatted consistently and strategically placed.\n\nI'll aim for a UN-friendly tone that's professional yet approachable. This means using clear, direct language that avoids overly complex bureaucratic phrasing while maintaining a formal academic tone.\n\nThe key actions will be:\n- Streamline the Three Voices section\n- Reorganize work samples\n- Adjust document language\n- Ensure overall coherence and professionalismGot it. Let me clarify and clean this up:\n\n**About \"Three Voices\":** This was an example activity I made up to show what a GCED session could look like. If you don't actually use this method, let's remove it or replace it with a real activity from Bloom. Do you have a specific exercise you run that hits cognitive + socio-emotional + behavioral? Like a check-in format or reflection prompt you actually use?\n\n**Where work samples go:** They should be in the P11 form under \"Past Work or Reports/Publications\" - I'll format that section cleaner below.\n\n**UN friendly mid-heavy:** Got it - professional but not stiff.

Assignment Understanding**\n\nUNESCO Bangkok requires rapid delivery of publishable GCED materials: webinar kits by early November, annual meeting packages before December 5, web content, analytical reports, and a 2026 proposal—all clear, gender-responsive, UNESCO-compliant, and usable by practitioners across Asia-Pacific.\n\n**B. Methodology**\n\n**First: Education is transmitted from the inside out**\n\nAPCEIU states that GCED teachers must be competent in global citizenship themselves. As someone who lives in France, grew up in the US, and works across SWANA building alliances, I agree. Here is how Bloom's work maps to GCED's subject-specific competencies:\n\n**Knowledge & critical thinking about global issues:**  \nWe help people understand their deeper \"why\"—the problem they see in the world and why they care.

Remove or clarify the Three Voices example (I'll ask them if they use this method or replace with something they do)\n\n\n2. I'll refine the work samples section to improve clarity and professional presentation. I'll ensure the Wamda article, PTG/Asfari excerpt, and 6-page document are formatted consistently and strategically placed.\n\nI'll aim for a UN-friendly tone that's professional yet approachable. This means using clear, direct language that avoids overly complex bureaucratic phrasing while maintaining a formal academic tone.\n\nThe key actions will be:\n- Streamline the Three Voices section\n- Reorganize work samples\n- Adjust document language\n- Ensure overall coherence and professionalism",

With the UN's International Trade Centre in Iraq (2024-25), I co-developed a sustainable construction curriculum and delivered trainer guides for 50+ stakeholders. At Bloom, I developed our pedagogy and facilitated a third of our 118 accelerator cycles reaching 1,011 teams across 16 countries, focusing on three methods: upside-down pyramid (learner agency), community check-ins (Ubuntu: we are strong because we are together), and strengths-based assessment.\n\n**GCED Connections:**\n\nOur **HerMeNow program** was 100% women founders—from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya—all working on green ventures. Global citizenship has been a core part of our pedagogical approach, with each cohort bridging multiple countries and developing implicit competencies. We created the conditions for it: women from diverse languages and contexts collaborating to solve problems together, supported by international mentors from Silicon Valley to the region. Many of those mentors today are former Bloom participants from a decade ago. That network—bridging technology partners across borders, building relationships that endure—is how you build global citizenship competence: identity, empathy, respect for diversity, local action linked to global solidarity.\n\nUNESCO describes GCED as \"not a single subject with a set curriculum but rather a framework, a prism through which education is considered.\" This is precisely how we approach Bloom's methodology—as a container where core principles remain constant (agency, strengths, community, reflection) while content and delivery adapt to context. While I have not previously been commissioned for GCED documentation, my methods and outputs align with GCED practice, and Bloom's approach aligns well with the framework. We help people understand their \"why\"—the challenge they see in the world—then see themselves and their community as sources of solutions. This builds the cognitive (critical thinking about global issues), socio-emotional (empathy, belonging to common humanity), and behavioral (responsible action) competencies that GCED describes. Social enterprise training is an aligned vehicle for GCED.\n\nI have also worked with **EntreComp** and **GreenComp**—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED. I know how to translate competency frameworks into activities, assessment tools, and educator guidance. My most recent project involved developing training-for-trainers to support educators.\n\nMy current ITC contract concludes mid-October. I complete work in Mosul on October 17 and can begin immediately. I have delivered concept notes, agendas, slide decks, and web content under UN timelines and understand how to build appropriate feedback buffers. Based in Lille, I can accommodate calls within ±2 hours of 11:00-15:00 Bangkok time.\n\n**I will deliver:**\n- Webinar and meeting packages (concepts, agendas, run-of-show, slides, communications)\n- Short web articles (≤250 words) and country documentation\n- Analytical reports (≤7 pages) with gender lens\n- Practical 2026 workplan\n\nCV, work samples, and proposals are attached.\n\nWarm regards,  \nBilal Ghalib\n\n---\n\n### **TECHNICAL PROPOSAL - APPROACH & METHODOLOGY**\n\n**A. Assignment Understanding**\n\nUNESCO Bangkok requires rapid delivery of publishable GCED materials: webinar kits by early November, annual meeting packages before December 5, web content, analytical reports, and a 2026 proposal—all clear, gender-responsive, UNESCO-compliant, and usable by practitioners across Asia-Pacific.\n\n**B. Methodology**\n\n**First: Education is transmitted from the inside out**\n\nAPCEIU states that GCED teachers must be competent in global citizenship themselves. As someone who lives in France, grew up in the US, and works across SWANA building alliances, I agree. Here is how Bloom's work maps to GCED's subject-specific competencies:\n\n**Knowledge & critical thinking about global issues:**  \nWe help people understand their deeper \"why\"—the problem they see in the world and why they care. Then we help them see themselves and their community as sources of solutions. Whether addressing climate change, economic inequality, or post-conflict recovery, we teach systems thinking and agency. In our programs, we facilitate collective intelligence where teams in Kenya think alongside teams in Lebanon about new approaches to their core challenges.\n\n**Identity as global citizen + respect for diversity:**  \nHerMeNow was a women-only cross-country program with founders from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya, all working on green ventures. We built a community of interconnected global citizens—an experience visible during our retreat, where strong bonds and new collaborations formed across teams. Women from different languages and contexts learned together, supported by international mentors. That network—from Silicon Valley to regional partners, many of whom are former Bloom participants from a decade ago—builds genuine solidarity across borders. This is GCED: belonging to common humanity, appreciation of differences, empathy.\n\n**Commitment to shared values + action:**  \nEvery Bloom program connects learners to mentors across borders. We use Ubuntu as one of our guiding frameworks: we are strong because we are together. Through community check-ins, peer learning, and collaborative problem-solving, people take local action with global support.\n\nUNESCO states that GCED is \"not a single subject with a set curriculum but rather a framework, a prism through which education is considered.\"\n\nMy work has been to design a methodology that acts like that prism, creating space for the emergence of those values—as described in the attached facilitation guide. The principles remain consistent across our programming: upside-down pyramid questioning rubric for agency, strengths-based growth, community-first design, reflection and action. Content flexes to context. A refugee youth program in Jordan differs from a corporate program in Dubai, but the pedagogy remains the same. I am prepared to learn and adapt to the Southeast Asian context.\n\n**Bloom's methodology aligns well with the GCED framework:**\n- Learner agency over prescription\n- Values + skills + knowledge, not only cognitive content\n- Transforming learners into active change agents\n- Adapting to context while maintaining core principles\n\nI have worked with **EntreComp** (entrepreneurship) and **GreenComp** (sustainability)—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED. With a master's in Learning Sciences and UN experience, I know how to translate frameworks into activities and guidance.\n\n**Second: Practical methods for this assignment**\n\n**Upside-down pyramid:** The first person to respond is the question asker, then the collective cohort, then finally the facilitators—emphasizing agency and community.\n\n**Community rituals:** Webinar designs include check-ins, peer exchange, and collaborative sense-making to build trust.\n\n**Strengths-based:** Reports begin with what is working, then identify development opportunities.\n\n**GCED in activities:** Sessions can include (1) reflective prompts on identity/bias/media literacy, (2) cross-context peer exchange, (3) one local action step—addressing cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioral dimensions.\n\n**Gender lens:** Structural program design (remote-first, female-facilitated, women-only cohorts where appropriate) foregrounds women and girls, uses inclusive language, and incorporates gender-disaggregated data.\n\n**Evidence + clarity:** Grounded in UNESCO research and regional data, using plain language and footnoted sources.\n\n**C. Timeline** (October 20 start; Days 1-3 light onboarding)\n\n**Oct 17-23 – Preparation (3 days)**  \nDesk review (GCED/NEQMAP/APCEIU materials), alignment call, style guide development\n\n**Oct 24-Nov 15 – October deliverables (18 days)**\n- 1.1 Webinar kit: Draft Oct 24-28 → Submit Oct 29 → Final Nov 4\n- 1.2 Announcements + country notes: Draft Oct 30-Nov 3 → Submit Nov 4 → Final Nov 8\n- 1.3 Annual meeting package: Draft Nov 5-11 → Submit Nov 11 → Final Nov 15\n\n**Nov 18-Dec 5 – Web content + inputs (11 days)**\n- 2.1 Web pieces: Draft Nov 18-21 → Submit Nov 22 → Final Nov 26\n- 2.2 Annual report inputs: Draft Nov 25-Dec 1 → Submit Dec 1 → Final Dec 5\n\n**Dec 9-20 – Synthesis (10 days)**\n- 3.1 PowerPoint: Draft Dec 9-12 → Submit Dec 13 → Final Dec 17\n- 3.2 Thematic brief: Draft Dec 16-18 → Submit Dec 18 → Final Dec 20\n\n**Jan 23-Feb 20 – Forward planning (8 days)**\n- 4.1 & 4.2 Proposal + evaluation: Draft Jan 23-Feb 5 → Submit Feb 6 → Final Feb 20\n\n**Total: 50 days**  \nEach deliverable includes 3-5 day review buffer.\n\n**D. Quality Assurance**\n\nUNESCO editorial compliance, Word/PowerPoint formats (+PDF), slides with speaker notes, inclusive language and imagery, gender-disaggregated data where available, clean version control.\n\n---\n\n### **FINANCIAL PROPOSAL**\n\n**Daily Rate:** USD 500 (flexible to 450-475 if scope remains constant)  \n**Level of Effort:** 50 days  \n**Total Contract Value:** USD 25,000\n\n**Payment Schedule (front-loaded for October delivery intensity):**\n- 30% ($7,500) upon contract signature\n- 40% ($10,000) upon acceptance of December 20 deliverables\n- 30% ($7,500) upon acceptance of February 20 deliverables\n\n**Travel:** If requested for in-person participation, economy airfare + DSA per UNESCO rules (otherwise home-based, Lille)\n\n---\n\n**Available October 20, 2025. Can accommodate coordination calls October 12-19 while concluding Mosul assignment.**\n\n---\n\n**Questions for you:**\n\n1. Should I remove the \"Three Voices\" example entirely, or do you have a real Bloom exercise I can describe instead? (Something you actually do in sessions that hits cognitive + socio-emotional + behavioral)\n\n2. Work samples formatting above ok for P11 form?\n\n3. Anything else that sounds off or too formal/informal?",

I found several real Bloom activities. Let me pick the best one that shows cognitive + socio-emotional + behavioral dimensions:\n\n1. **Circle Check-ins with Gratitude Reflection** - This is good, shows reflection and community\n2. **Collective Character Strengths Sharing** - This is also good\n3. **Golden Circle (Discovering Your Why)** - This is excellent! It has:\n   - Cognitive: Critical thinking about their purpose and impact\n   - Socio-emotional: Connecting to personal values and meaning\n   - Behavioral: Frames how they communicate and take action\n\nThe Golden Circle is actually perfect because it's a concrete activity they use, it's well-known (Simon Sinek), and it clearly maps to GCED competencies.

Discovering your Why: How do you talk about what you do?\r\nThe Golden Circle is a concept developed by Simon Sinek, who says, “people don’t buy\r\nwhat you do. They buy why you do it.”\r\nAccording to Sinek, most people communicate by starting with the “what” they do and\r\neventually work their way back to talk about “how” and “why” they do what they do.\r\nBut companies universally identified as unique and successful think Apple or Google\r\ncommunicate with an “inside-out” type of thinking.\r\nThey start with the why, and only then do they talk about the how and what portions of\r\nwhat they do.\r\nTo use the Golden Circle for your enterprise, just help them answer three simple\r\nquestions:\r\nWhy – Why are you doing what you are doing? For example, why are you in business,\r\nand why did you develop your product or service?\r\nHow – How will this help your readers? For example, what problems are you solving for\r\nyour readers, and what challenges are you helping them overcome?\r\nWhat – What are you offering? For example, what is your product or service, and what\r\nare its features and benefits?\r\n2. Assessing: What are your priorities for the upcoming period?\r\nProgram managers invite the teams to take the assessments to reflect on their\r\nindividual and organizational development. After reflecting on their results in their\r\nteams, program managers invite them to discuss them with their peers and mentors\r\nand start thinking about their core priority areas of development.\r\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 20 of 41",

It enables us to share personal relatedness and support the perpetual\r\ngrowth of each other, ourselves, and our environment. Being a part of a community can\r\nmake us feel like we are a part of something greater than ourselves. Providing unique\r\nopportunities for people to learn from each other and support and encouragement are\r\ninvaluable in joining forces with our peers.\r\nBloom Tools: We aim to create a healthy community for our enterprises, starting with:\r\n● The teams: Being part of a community enables us to support other members.\r\nSupportive of others will help them feel good and better about themselves.\r\n● The mentors: An open bond with new connections builds valuable relationships\r\nand gives us a more profound sense of belonging. It helps us to reach our goals\r\nand brings a sense of security.\r\n● The module leaders: Communities are rich in resources. Knowing is a unique\r\nresource, and through its use, it increases in value.\r\nWe encourage entrepreneurs to use the inverted pyramid in the context of learning\r\nand feedback. First, they evaluate themselves, then get feedback from their mentors,\r\nand then the module leaders give feedback.\r\nThe general architecture of a cycle\r\nBloom cycles takes the best from agile and design thinking methodologies used at\r\nleading innovation companies globally. We use these in our sprint and accelerator\r\nprograms to help teams develop their startup while learning leading productivity\r\ntechniques.\r\nCycle repetitions can include some of the below elements:\r\nActivities and Reflections\r\n● Weekly activities: Every other Tuesday, the program manager invites the teams\r\nto start new training activities and share their progress in the community\r\n● End-of-month reflections: At the end of each month, we send the teams a\r\nreflection and feedback form to understand and gauge their progress on several\r\nKPIs related to the program’s focus.\r\nLive online events\r\n● Training sessions: Each cycle will have 2-4 training activities whereby teams will\r\nreceive resources, including videos, tools, frameworks, and worksheets, to\r\nprepare them for the training sessions, where the module leader will facilitate an\r\ninteractive exchange of knowledge and expertise.\r\n● Mentor support: We invite mentors to join a speed mentoring session to\r\nfacilitate mentor matching.

A well-planned and well-facilitated event can have\r\nmore engagement and impact than a poorly planned or facilitated event.\r\nCreate Bridges Between the Physical and the Virtual\r\n● Play games and pass items back and forth between screens\r\n● Share tea, coffee, or a meal while on a call\r\n● Make a gift box of friendly perks/treats/tools to help them in the accelerator, and\r\nthings to do fun games/activities with:\r\n○ Inspirational items (posters, notebooks, magnets, etc.)\r\n○ Shirts, hats, or something to wear\r\n○ Clown noses or fun items (in wrapping that disguises what they are until\r\nuse)\r\n○ Tools for activities, such as printouts of frameworks, post-its, pens, activity\r\ncards, etc.\r\n○ Stretching exercises, especially after having been at the laptop for more\r\nthan half an hour.\r\n○ Sharing music: In each session, let a participant choose the session’s\r\nbackground music\r\n○ Whiteboard: share the whiteboard before the session begins and ask each\r\nparticipant to share a motivational quote/message.\r\nSimple Tips for Increasing Engagement Online\r\n● Eye contact: Look at the camera (not the screen) when talking, especially when\r\nrecording something\r\n● The background: Something nice? Art? Outdoors? Inspiring? A banner with\r\nlogos?\r\nProgram Management Guide v2 Page 40 of 41",

My professional path demonstrates deep commitment to bridging practice and policy, with a particular emphasis on learning sciences and global citizenship education. Working at a regional and global level allows me to contribute meaningful insights across diverse cultural contexts, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. This UNESCO Bangkok role represents an ideal opportunity to integrate my cross-cultural expertise, policy understanding, and commitment to educational innovation.Based on everything we've discussed, here are direct answers in your voice:\n\n---\n\n## **1. How have your achievements and professional experience prepared you for this position?**\n\nOver 15 years I've built the exact skill set this position requires: translating competency frameworks into practical materials, documenting programs under tight timelines, and facilitating across cultures.\n\n**Documentation & rapid production:** At Bloom, I documented 118 accelerator cycles—concept notes, facilitation guides, activity libraries, assessment frameworks. With ITC in Iraq, I produced curriculum documents, trainer guides, and stakeholder reports for 50+ organizations while managing remote coordination. I know how to produce clean, usable materials fast.\n\n**Competency framework fluency:** I've worked extensively with EntreComp and GreenComp—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED (competency areas, knowledge + skills + values, learner-centered approaches). I know how to take frameworks and turn them into activities, assessment tools, and educator guidance. That's what the GCED-NEQMAP synthesis work requires.\n\n**Gender-responsive design:** HerMeNow was 100% women founders from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya. I designed structural interventions (remote-first, female-facilitated, women-only cohorts) that achieved genuine participation, not just gender paragraphs. I published research on this for the Asfari Foundation with gender-disaggregated data and analysis.\n\n**Cross-cultural facilitation:** I've worked across 16 countries—Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, Middle East, Gulf. I know how to identify universal pedagogical principles while respecting cultural context. The Asia-Pacific GCED Network needs materials that work across diverse settings; I've been doing this for a decade.\n\n**UN systems:** I've worked with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français as both grantee and consultant. I understand editorial standards, review cycles, multi-stakeholder coordination, and how to write for practitioners while meeting institutional requirements.\n\n**GCED competence in practice:** The APCEIU document says GCED teachers must be competent in global citizenship themselves. I live this. Bloom's methodology builds identity as global citizens, critical thinking about global issues, respect for diversity, and local action with global solidarity. I don't just write about GCED—I practice it.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Please describe any skills and competencies you have which may be of particular relevance to this position.**\n\n**Rapid synthesis & concise writing:** I can distill complex content into accessible formats. The web articles (≤250 words), thematic briefs (≤7 pages), and concept notes this position requires are formats I produce regularly. I write for practitioners, not academics—plain language, clear structure, evidence-based but not jargon-heavy.\n\n**Competency framework translation:** I take abstract frameworks (EntreComp, GreenComp, PERMAH, VIA Character Strengths) and turn them into practical tools—learning activities, assessment rubrics, facilitation guides. The GCED-NEQMAP alignment work requires exactly this: bridging competency frameworks with assessment systems.\n\n**Gender analysis:** I don't just add gender paragraphs. I design programs with structural changes (HerMeNow: 100% women, remote-first to accommodate caregiving, female-facilitated). I analyze data by gender, identify barriers women face, and propose interventions that work. This matters for GCED materials serving diverse learners.\n\n**Stakeholder coordination:** At ITC I coordinated 44 interviews and 50+ stakeholders across government, NGOs, private sector, and community organizations. I know how to gather input, synthesize feedback, and produce materials that diverse stakeholders can use. The GCED Network has multiple stakeholders (ministries of education, APCEIU, UNESCO regional offices)—I've managed this complexity before.\n\n**Cross-cultural pedagogy:** Working across SWANA and Africa taught me how to design learning that honors context while holding core principles. A refugee program in Jordan differs from a corporate program in Dubai, but the pedagogy stays consistent. This is what GCED materials for Asia-Pacific need.\n\n**Evidence-based documentation:** I published research for the Asfari Foundation on post-traumatic growth in social entrepreneurship programs—quantitative analysis, literature review, clear recommendations. I know how to ground materials in research while making them actionable.\n\n**UN editorial compliance:** I've written for UNESCO and UNDP. I know the style requirements: politically neutral language, inclusive terminology, proper citations, clean formatting. I can produce materials that pass institutional review on the first round.\n\n**Independent work under deadlines:** I've managed entire projects remotely—curriculum development in Iraq, program documentation for Bloom, research for foundations. I don't need hand-holding. I clarify requirements upfront, build review buffers, and deliver on time.\n\n---\n\n## **3. How does this position align with your career expectations?**\n\nThis position sits exactly where I want to be: translating practice into policy-level resources that shape education systems.\n\n**From practice to policy:** I've spent 15 years building and running programs. That's taught me what works in the field. Now I want to influence how education systems integrate transformative learning at scale. GCED is systemic—it's not one more subject, it's a prism through which all education is considered. That's the shift I want to support.\n\n**Learning sciences depth:** I have a master's in Learning Sciences and I want to keep developing this expertise. Working with UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU on GCED frameworks, assessment systems, and evidence synthesis lets me deepen my understanding of how competency-based education works at regional and national levels.\n\n**Regional expansion:** My work has been concentrated in SWANA and Africa. I'm ready to learn about Southeast Asia and the broader Asia-Pacific context. Understanding how GCED is implemented across diverse cultural and political contexts will make me a better educator and consultant globally.\n\n**Systems-level impact:** At Bloom I reached 1,011 teams across 16 countries. That's meaningful, but it's still direct service. This position contributes to systemic change—producing materials that inform national education policies, teacher training programs, and assessment frameworks across the Asia-Pacific region. That's the scale of impact I'm moving toward.\n\n**Bridging silos:** I want to work at the intersection of wellbeing, education, and social change. GCED integrates these—it's about developing whole people (cognitive, socio-emotional, behavioral competencies) who can address global challenges. That's exactly the work I want to do for the next decade.\n\n**UNESCO affiliation:** I've worked with UN agencies as a grantee and short-term consultant.

            "text": "Based on everything we've discussed, here are direct answers in your voice:\n\n---\n\n## **1. How have your achievements and professional experience prepared you for this position?**\n\nOver 15 years I've built the exact skill set this position requires: translating competency frameworks into practical materials, documenting programs under tight timelines, and facilitating across cultures.\n\n**Documentation & rapid production:** At Bloom, I documented 118 accelerator cycles—concept notes, facilitation guides, activity libraries, assessment frameworks. With ITC in Iraq, I produced curriculum documents, trainer guides, and stakeholder reports for 50+ organizations while managing remote coordination. I know how to produce clean, usable materials fast.\n\n**Competency framework fluency:** I've worked extensively with EntreComp and GreenComp—both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED (competency areas, knowledge + skills + values, learner-centered approaches). I know how to take frameworks and turn them into activities, assessment tools, and educator guidance. That's what the GCED-NEQMAP synthesis work requires.\n\n**Gender-responsive design:** HerMeNow was 100% women founders from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya. I designed structural interventions (remote-first, female-facilitated, women-only cohorts) that achieved genuine participation, not just gender paragraphs. I published research on this for the Asfari Foundation with gender-disaggregated data and analysis.\n\n**Cross-cultural facilitation:** I've worked across 16 countries—Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, Middle East, Gulf. I know how to identify universal pedagogical principles while respecting cultural context. The Asia-Pacific GCED Network needs materials that work across diverse settings; I've been doing this for a decade.\n\n**UN systems:** I've worked with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français as both grantee and consultant. I understand editorial standards, review cycles, multi-stakeholder coordination, and how to write for practitioners while meeting institutional requirements.\n\n**GCED competence in practice:** The APCEIU document says GCED teachers must be competent in global citizenship themselves. I live this. Bloom's methodology builds identity as global citizens, critical thinking about global issues, respect for diversity, and local action with global solidarity. I don't just write about GCED—I practice it.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Please describe any skills and competencies you have which may be of particular relevance to this position.**\n\n**Rapid synthesis & concise writing:** I can distill complex content into accessible formats. The web articles (≤250 words), thematic briefs (≤7 pages), and concept notes this position requires are formats I produce regularly. I write for practitioners, not academics—plain language, clear structure, evidence-based but not jargon-heavy.\n\n**Competency framework translation:** I take abstract frameworks (EntreComp, GreenComp, PERMAH, VIA Character Strengths) and turn them into practical tools—learning activities, assessment rubrics, facilitation guides. The GCED-NEQMAP alignment work requires exactly this: bridging competency frameworks with assessment systems.\n\n**Gender analysis:** I don't just add gender paragraphs. I design programs with structural changes (HerMeNow: 100% women, remote-first to accommodate caregiving, female-facilitated). I analyze data by gender, identify barriers women face, and propose interventions that work. This matters for GCED materials serving diverse learners.\n\n**Stakeholder coordination:** At ITC I coordinated 44 interviews and 50+ stakeholders across government, NGOs, private sector, and community organizations. I know how to gather input, synthesize feedback, and produce materials that diverse stakeholders can use. The GCED Network has multiple stakeholders (ministries of education, APCEIU, UNESCO regional offices)—I've managed this complexity before.\n\n**Cross-cultural pedagogy:** Working across SWANA and Africa taught me how to design learning that honors context while holding core principles. A refugee program in Jordan differs from a corporate program in Dubai, but the pedagogy stays consistent. This is what GCED materials for Asia-Pacific need.\n\n**Evidence-based documentation:** I published research for the Asfari Foundation on post-traumatic growth in social entrepreneurship programs—quantitative analysis, literature review, clear recommendations. I know how to ground materials in research while making them actionable.\n\n**UN editorial compliance:** I've written for UNESCO and UNDP. I know the style requirements: politically neutral language, inclusive terminology, proper citations, clean formatting. I can produce materials that pass institutional review on the first round.\n\n**Independent work under deadlines:** I've managed entire projects remotely—curriculum development in Iraq, program documentation for Bloom, research for foundations. I don't need hand-holding. I clarify requirements upfront, build review buffers, and deliver on time.\n\n---\n\n## **3. How does this position align with your career expectations?**\n\nThis position sits exactly where I want to be: translating practice into policy-level resources that shape education systems.\n\n**From practice to policy:** I've spent 15 years building and running programs. That's taught me what works in the field. Now I want to influence how education systems integrate transformative learning at scale. GCED is systemic—it's not one more subject, it's a prism through which all education is considered. That's the shift I want to support.\n\n**Learning sciences depth:** I have a master's in Learning Sciences and I want to keep developing this expertise. Working with UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU on GCED frameworks, assessment systems, and evidence synthesis lets me deepen my understanding of how competency-based education works at regional and national levels.\n\n**Regional expansion:** My work has been concentrated in SWANA and Africa. I'm ready to learn about Southeast Asia and the broader Asia-Pacific context. Understanding how GCED is implemented across diverse cultural and political contexts will make me a better educator and consultant globally.\n\n**Systems-level impact:** At Bloom I reached 1,011 teams across 16 countries. That's meaningful, but it's still direct service. This position contributes to systemic change—producing materials that inform national education policies, teacher training programs, and assessment frameworks across the Asia-Pacific region. That's the scale of impact I'm moving toward.\n\n**Bridging silos:** I want to work at the intersection of wellbeing, education, and social change. GCED integrates these—it's about developing whole people (cognitive, socio-emotional, behavioral competencies) who can address global challenges. That's exactly the work I want to do for the next decade.\n\n**UNESCO affiliation:** I've worked with UN agencies as a grantee and short-term consultant. I want to deepen this relationship and contribute more directly to international development goals. Target 4.7 (GCED and ESD) is where education meets sustainability and peace—that's where I see my long-term contribution.\n\nThis consultancy is a stepping stone. If it goes well, I'd be interested in longer-term collaboration with UNESCO or transitioning into roles that shape transformative education policy regionally or globally.\n\n---\n\nThese answers are:\n- **Direct** (your voice, not corporate)\n- **Specific** (real examples, not generic claims)\n- **Connected to job requirements** (each point maps to a function they listed)\n- **Honest about trajectory** (you're moving from practice to policy, this is part of that arc)\n\nWant me to adjust the tone or emphasis anywhere?",

It is meant to act as a field\nguide to help detect undisclosed AI-generated content on\nWikipedia. This list is descriptive, not prescriptive; it consists\nof observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or\nlanguage to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the\npolicies and guidelines and the Manual of Style, but does not\nbelong on this page.\nThis list is not a ban on certain words, phrases, or\npunctuation. No one is taking your em-dashes away or\nclaiming that only LLMs use them. Not all text featuring the\nfollowing indicators is AI-generated, as the large language\nLLMs tend to have an identifiable writing\nmodels that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing,\nstyle.\nincluding the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a\ncatalog of very common patterns observed over many\nthousands of instances of AI-generated text, specific to Wikipedia. While some of its advice may be\nbroadly applicable, some signs—particularly those involving punctuation and formatting—may not apply\nin a non-Wikipedia context.\nThe patterns here are also only potential signs of a problem, not the problem itself. While many of these\nissues are immediately obvious and easy to fix—e.g., excessive boldface, poor wordsmithing, broken\nmarkup, citation style quirks—they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry much more\nserious policy risks. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently tidied up), those\nsurface defects might not be present, but the deeper problems likely will. Please do not merely treat these\nsigns as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those\ndeeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at\nWikipedia:Large language models § Handling suspected LLM-generated content and\nWikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide.\nThe speedy deletion policy criterion G15 (LLM-generated pages without human review) is limited to the\nmost objective and least contestable indications that the page's content was generated by an LLM. There\nare three such indicators, the first of which can be found in § Communication intended for the user and\nthe other two in § Citations. The other signs, though they may indeed indicate AI use, are not sufficient\nfor speedy deletion.\nDo not solely rely on artificial intelligence content detection tools (such as GPTZero) to evaluate whether\ntext is LLM-generated. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have nontrivial error\nrates and cannot replace human judgment.[1]\nLanguage and tone\nLLMs (and artificial neural networks in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should\ncome next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to regress to the mean; that is, the\nresult tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can\nsimultaneously be a strength and a \"tell\" for detecting AI-generated content.\nFor example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally\ndescribed with positive, important-sounding language. It will thus sand down specific, unusual, nuanced\nfacts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are\nstatistically common). Thus the specific detail \"invented a train-coupling device\" might become \"a\nrevolutionary titan of industry.\" LLMs tend to smooth out unusual details and drift toward the most\ncommon, statistically probable way of describing a topic. It is like shouting louder and louder that a\nportrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph\ninto a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.[2]\nThis statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements that\ncould apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.\nUndue emphasis on symbolism and importance\nWords to watch: stands as / serves as / is a testament, plays a vital/significant/crucial\nrole, underscores its importance, highlights its significance, continues to captivate,\nleaves a lasting impact, watershed moment, key turning point, deeply rooted,\nprofound heritage, steadfast dedication, indelible mark, solidifies ...\nLLM writing often puffs up the importance of the subject matter with reminders that it represents or\ncontributes to a broader topic.[3] There seems to be only a small repertoire of ways that it writes these\nreminders, so if they are otherwise appropriate it would be best to reword them anyway.\nWhen talking about biology (e.g. when asked to discuss a given animal or plant species), LLMs tend to\nput too much emphasis on the species' conservation status and the efforts to protect it, even if the status is\nunknown and no serious efforts exist.\nExamples\nDouera enjoys close proximity to the capital city, Algiers, further enhancing its significance as a\ndynamic hub of activity and culture.

This is often a byproduct of an essay-like structure that implies synthesis of facts,\nwhich is typical of LLM writing but inappropriate for Wikipedia.\nExamples\nAI-generated example\nThe methodology's strength is its grounding in iterative, mixed-method\ndevelopment cycles that combine theoretical analysis with practical feedback. Its\nemphasis on prototyping and empirical validation supports early identification of\ndesign shortcomings, while the use of scenario-based design and claims analysis\nhelps make the rationale behind design choices explicit and testable. Furthermore,\nthe incorporation of values—as operational design elements rather than abstract\nprinciples—helps bring ethical and societal concerns into concrete design and\nevaluation processes.\nAt the same time, several areas for improvement remain. For example, while the\nmethodology supports transdisciplinary collaboration in principle, applying it\neffectively in large, heterogeneous teams can be challenging. Coordinating\nbetween cognitive scientists, engineers, designers, and domain experts requires\ncareful facilitation and often additional effort in communication and documentation.\nAnother area for further development involves the scalability of design patterns\nand ontologies across domains. While abstraction is a key feature of the\nmethodology, generalizing knowledge without oversimplifying context-specific\nconstraints remains an ongoing tension. Similarly, methods for operationalizing\nand measuring values—especially those that are contested or context-dependent\n—can benefit from more robust frameworks and shared benchmarks.\nSCE continues to evolve in response to these challenges. Its current form provides\na solid foundation for responsible system development, particularly in settings\nwhere human judgment, collaboration, and adaptation remain essential. However,\nits long-term value will depend on ongoing methodological refinement, empirical\nvalidation in diverse settings, and sustained attention to issues of interdisciplinary\ncoordination and value negotiation.\n—\nFrom Draft:Socio-cognitive engineering\nCompare the above with below human-written prose. Even disregarding the absence of buzzwords and\ngeneral vapidness, the connecting phrases in the below excerpt are more varied and less conspicuous.\nHuman-written example\nSocial heuristics can include heuristics that use social information, operate in\nsocial contexts, or both. Examples of social information include information about\nthe behavior of a social entity or the properties of a social system, while nonsocial\ninformation is information about something physical. Contexts in which an\norganism may use social heuristics can include \"games against nature\" and \"social\ngames\". In games against nature, the organism strives to predict natural\noccurrences (such as the weather) or competes against other natural forces to\naccomplish something. In social games, the organism is making decisions in a\nsituation that involves other social beings. Importantly, in social games, the most\nadaptive course of action also depends on the decisions and behavior of the other\nactors. For instance, the follow-the-majority heuristic uses social information as\ninputs but is not necessarily applied in a social context, while the equity-heuristic\nuses non-social information but can be applied in a social context such as the\nallocation of parental resources amongst offspring.\nWithin social psychology, some researchers have viewed heuristics as closely\nlinked to cognitive biases. Others have argued that these biases result from the\napplication of social heuristics depending on the structure of the environment that\nthey operate in. Researchers in the latter approach treat the study of social\nheuristics as closely linked to social rationality, a field of research that applies the\nideas of bounded rationality and heuristics to the realm of social environments.\nUnder this view, social heuristics are seen as ecologically rational. In the context of\nevolution, research utilizing evolutionary simulation models has found support for\nthe evolution of social heuristics and cooperation when the outcomes of social\ninteractions are uncertain.\n—\nFrom Social heuristics, a Good Article\nSection summaries\nWords to watch: In summary, In conclusion, Overall ...\nWhen generating longer outputs (such as when told to \"write an article\"), LLMs typically add a section\ntitled \"Conclusion\" or similar, and will often end a paragraph or section by summarizing and restating its\ncore idea.[4]\nExamples\nIn summary, the educational and training trajectory for nurse scientists typically involves a\nprogression from a master's degree in nursing to a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, followed\nby postdoctoral training in nursing research.

This is often done by attaching a present participle (\"-ing\") phrase at the end of\nsentences, sometimes with vague attributions to third parties (see below).[3] These comments are\ngenerally unhelpful as they introduce unnecessary or fictional opinions.\nExamples\nIn 2025, the Federation was internationally recognized and invited to participate in the Asia\nPickleball Summit, highlighting Pakistan’s entry into the global pickleball community.\n—\nFrom this revision to Draft:Pakistan Pickleball Federation\nConsumers benefit from the flexibility to use their preferred mobile wallet at participating\nmerchants, improving convenience.\n—\nFrom Draft:MyanmarPay MMQR\nThese citations, spanning more than six decades and appearing in recognized academic\npublications, illustrate Blois' lasting influence in computational linguistics, grammar, and\nneology.\n—\nFrom this revision to Draft:Jacques Blois (linguist)\nThe civil rights movement emerged as a powerful continuation of this struggle, emphasizing the\nimportance of solidarity and collective action in the fight for justice.\n—\nFrom this revision to African-American culture\nVague attributions of opinion\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\n§ Unsupported attributions.\nWords to watch: Industry reports, Observers have cited, Some critics argue ...\nAI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called weasel\nwording—while citing only one or two sources that may or may not actually express such view. They\nalso tend to overgeneralize a perspective of one or few sources into that of a wider group.\nExamples\nHere, the weasel wording implies the opinion comes from an independent source, but it actually cites\nNick Ford's own website.\nHis [Nick Ford's] compositions have been described as exploring conceptual themes and\nbridging the gaps between artistic media.[a]\n—\nDraft:Nick Ford (musician)\nDue to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and\nconservationists.

Retrieved 2025-06-25.\nElegant variation\nFor a non-AI-specific style essay about this, see Wikipedia:The problem with elegant variation.\nGenerative AI has a repetition-penalty code, meant to discourage it from reusing words too often.[3] For\ninstance, the output might give a main character's name and then repeatedly use a different synonym or\nrelated term (e.g., protagonist, key player, eponymous character) when mentioning it again.\nNote: If a user adds multiple pieces of AI-generated content in separate edits, this tell may not apply, as\neach piece of text may have been generated in isolation.\nFalse ranges\nWhen from ... to ... constructions are not used figuratively, they are used to indicate the lower and\nupper bounds of a scale. The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range\n(e.g. from 1990 to 2000, from 15 to 20 ounces, from winter to autumn), or qualitative,\ninvolving categorical bounds (e.g. \"from seed to tree\", \"from mild to severe\", \"from white\nbelt to black belt\"). The same constructions may be used to form a merism—a figure of speech that\ncombines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative\nmeaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable\nscale: from head to toe (the length of a body denoting the whole body), from soup to nuts\n(clearly based on time), etc. This is not a false range.\nLLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply\nmentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be\nidentified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another\nscale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a\nfalse range. LLMs often employ \"figurative\" (often simply: meaningless) \"from ... to ...\n\"\nconstructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or essentially\nunrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless\nlanguage is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by materials\nconsisting of persuasive writing during their training.\nExamples\nOur journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand\ncosmic web, from the birth and death of stars that forge the elements of life, to the enigmatic\ndance of dark matter and dark energy that shape its destiny.\n[...]\nIntelligence and Creativity: From problem-solving and tool-making to scientific discovery,\nartistic expression, and technological innovation, human intelligence is characterized by its\nadaptability and capacity for novel solutions.\n[...]\nContinued Scientific Discovery: The quest to understand the universe, life, and ourselves will\ncontinue to drive scientific breakthroughs, from fundamental physics to medicine and\nneuroscience.\n—\nFrom Draft:The Cosmos Unveiled: A Grand Tapestry of Existence\nStyle\nTitle caseFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters § Headings,\nheaders, and captions.\nIn section headings, AI chatbots strongly tend to consistently capitalize all main words (title case).[1]\nExamples\nEarly Life and Education\nThomas was born in Cochranville, Pennsylvania.

Thomas\nExcessive use of boldface\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting § Boldface.\nAI chatbots may display various phrases in boldface for emphasis in an excessive, mechanical manner.\nOne of their tendencies, inherited from readmes, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles\nand other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase,\noften in a \"key takeaways\" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid\noveruse of boldface.\nExamples\nIt blends OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and\nvisual strategy tools such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and Balanced Scorecard\n(BSC). OPC is designed to bridge the gap between strategy and execution by fostering a unified\nmindset and shared direction within organizations.\n—\nFrom Draft:One Page 4 Change (OPC)\nInline-header vertical lists\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists § Use prose where\nunderstood easily.\nAI chatbots' content often includes vertical lists. A particular list formatting is employed: It comprises an\nordered or unordered list where the list marker (number, bullet, dash, etc.) is followed by an inline\nboldfaced header of sorts; a colon then separates it from the remaining descriptive text. (Separately from\nthis sign, this is one of the things which cause overabundant boldfacing; see § Excessive use of boldface)\nInstead of proper wikitext, a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen\n(-), en dash (–), or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as\n1.) instead of standard wikitext. When copied as bare text appearing on the screen, some of the\nformatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.\nExamples\n1.

LLMs especially tend to use em-dashes in a formulaic, pat\nway, often mimicking \"punching up\" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.\nThis sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself.\nExamples\nElwandore is a virtual micronation for people with passion and skill — a place to build, to\ncreate, and to help each other grow while chasing wealth. But not wealth for greed — wealth to\ngive, to help others, to donate.\n—\nFrom this version (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1293560598&oldid=) of\nDraft:United Digital Republic Of Elwandore\nThe term “Dutch Caribbean” is not used in the statute and is primarily promoted by Dutch\ninstitutions, not by the people of the autonomous countries themselves. In practice, many\nDutch organizations and businesses use it for their own convenience, even placing it in\naddresses — e.g., “Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean” — but this only adds confusion internationally\nand erases national identity. You don’t say “Netherlands, Europe” as an address — yet this\nkind of mislabeling continues.\n—\nFrom this revision (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&diff=1286082047&oldid=) to\nTalk:Dutch Caribbean\nCurly quotation marks and apostrophes\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style § Quotation characters, and\nWikipedia:Manual of Style § Apostrophes.\nAI chatbots typically use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks (\"...\" or\n'...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same\nresponse. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’; the same character as the curly right single\nquotation mark) instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in contractions and possessive forms. They\nmay also do this inconsistently.\nCurly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. Microsoft Word as well as macOS and iOS devices have a\n\"smart quotes\" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as\nLanguageTool may also have such a feature. Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in\nprofessionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like Citer (https://citer.toolforge.or\ng/) may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example,\nMcClelland, Mac (2017-09-27). \"When 'Not Guilty' Is a Life Sentence\" (https://www.nytime\ns.com/2017/09/27/magazine/when-not-guilty-is-a-life-sentence.html).

It may also\npair it with text about what that information \"likely\" may be and why it is significant. This information is\nentirely speculative (including the very claim that it's \"not documented\") and may be based on loosely\nrelated topics or completely fabricated.

As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running\non MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like Miraheze, LLMs tend to lack wikitext-\nformatted training data. While the corpuses of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these\narticles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. This is compounded by\nthe fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely\napplied markup language: Markdown. Their system-level instructions direct them to format outputs using\nit, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen, enabling the display of\nheadings, bulleted and numbered lists, tables, etc, just as MediaWiki renders wikitext to make Wikipedia\narticles look like formatted documents.\nWhen asked about its \"formatting guidelines\", a chatbot willing to reveal some of its system-level\ninstructions will typically generate some variation of the following (this is Microsoft Copilot in mid-\n2025):\n## Formatting Guidelines\n- All output uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Use a single main title (`#`) and clear primary subheadings (`##`).\n- Keep paragraphs short (3–5 sentences, ≤150 words).\n- Break large topics into labeled subsections.\n- Present related items as bullet or numbered lists; number only when order matters.\n- Always leave a blank line before and after each paragraph.\n- Avoid bold or italic styling in body text unless explicitly requested.\n- Use horizontal dividers (`\n---\n`) between major sections.\n- Employ valid Markdown tables for structured comparisons or data summaries.\n- Refrain from complex Unicode symbols; stick to simple characters.\n- Reserve code blocks for code, poems, lyrics, or similarly formatted content.\n- For mathematical expressions, use LaTeX outside of code blocks.\nAs the above suggests, Markdown's syntax is completely different from wikitext's: Markdown uses\nasterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#)\ninstead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]) around\nURLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (----) for thematic breaks.\nEven when they are told to do so explicitly, chatbots generally struggle to generate text using\nsyntactically correct wikitext, as their training data lead to a drastically greater affinity for and fluency in\nMarkdown. When told to \"generate an article\", a chatbot will typically default to using Markdown for the\ngenerated output, which is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If\ninstructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might \"realize\" the need to generate Wikipedia-\ncompatible code, and might include a message like Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia\nmarkup format (`wikitext`)?[b] in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax will\noften be rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext\ncontent in a Markdown-style fenced code block (https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenc\ned-code-blocks) (its syntax for WP:PRE) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may\nalso be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both\nmarkup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as:\n```\nwikitext.\n[c]\nThe presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is\nLLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown alone\nis not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced\ninternet users frequently use Markdown in tools like Obsidian and GitHub, and on platforms like Reddit\n(https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043033952-Formatting-Guide), Discord (https://supp\nort.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underlin\ne), and Slack (https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages). Some writing tools and\napps, such as iOS Notes, Google Docs, and Windows Notepad, support Markdown editing or exporting.\nThe increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to\nsupport Markdown by default.\nExamples\nSee also: Markdown § Examples\nI believe this block has become procedurally and substantively unsound. Despite repeatedly\nraising clear, policy-based concerns, every unblock request has been met with **summary\nrejection** — not based on specific diffs or policy violations, but instead on **speculation\nabout motive**, assertions of being “unhelpful”, and a general impression that I am \"not here to\nbuild an encyclopedia\". No one has meaningfully addressed the fact that I have **not made\ndisruptive edits**, **not engaged in edit warring**, and have consistently tried to\n**collaborate through talk page discussion**, citing policy and inviting clarification. Instead, I\nhave encountered a pattern of dismissiveness from several administrators, where reasoned\nconcerns about **in-text attribution of partisan or interpretive claims** have been brushed\naside. Rather than engaging with my concerns, some editors have chosen to mock, speculate\nabout my motives, or label my arguments \"AI-generated\" — without explaining how they are\nsubstantively flawed.\n—\nFrom this revision (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&diff=1284964006&oldid=) to a\nuser talk page\n- The Wikipedia entry does not explicitly mention the \"Cyberhero League\" being recognized as\na winner of the World Future Society's BetaLaunch Technology competition, as detailed in the\ninterview with THE FUTURIST ([1] (https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-interview-wit\nh-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)(https://consciouscreativity.com/the-futurist-\ninterview-with-dana-klisanin-creator-of-the-cyberhero-league/)).

Note that this is also a\ncommon error made by new or returning editors.\nExamples\n[[Category:American hip hop musicians]]\n—\nFrom this revision to Draft:Paytra\nrather than\n[[Category:American hip-hop musicians]]\nCitations\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about this, see Wikipedia:Fictitious references.\nBroken external links\nIf a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and most of them are broken (error 404\npages), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website\narchiving sites like Internet Archive or Archive Today. Most links become broken (see link rot) over time,\nbut those factors make it unlikely that the link was ever valid.\nInvalid DOI and ISBNs\nFor non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs, see Wikipedia:DOI and Wikipedia:ISBN.\nA checksum can be used to verify ISBNs. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is\nincorrect, and citation templates will display a warning if so. Similarly, DOIs are more resistant to link rot\nthan regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of hallucinated\nreferences.\nRelated are DOIs that point to entirely different article and general book citations without pages. This\npassage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT.\nOhm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that\nstates the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to\nthe voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant.\nMathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the\nresistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it\nserves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. Ohm’s Law\napplies to many materials and components that are \"ohmic,\" meaning their resistance\nremains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for\nnon-linear devices like diodes or transistors [2][3].\nReferences:\n1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.).

The DOIs lead to completely\ndifferent citations and have other problems as well. For instance, C. L. Fortescue was dead for 30+ years\nat the purported time of writing, and Vol 55, Issue 11 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumb\ner=31102&punumber=5) does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information\ngiven in reference 3. Note also the use of curly quotation marks and apostrophes in some, but not all, of\nthe above text, another indicator that text may be LLM-generated.\nIncorrect or unconventional use of references\nAI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia\nexpects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.\nIn the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not\ncapable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search\nlaunched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.\nIn this case, the Smith, R. J. source – being the \"third source\" the tool presumably generated the link\n'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to\nthe body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{cite journal}}\nreference, even though the links resolve.\nThe LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.\nFor over thirty years, computers have been utilized in the rehabilitation of individuals\nwith brain injuries.

Also, the number of tokens that a single response has is usually limited,\nand further responses will require the user to select \"continue generating\".\nThis method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It\nmay also indicate a copyright violation rather than the use of an LLM.\nDiscrepancies in writing style and variety of English\nA sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other\ncommunication, may indicate the use of AI tools.\nAnother discrepancy is a mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and\nthe variety of English used. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably\nnot use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted\notherwise.[4] Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs\nshould only raise suspicion if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.\nAge of text relative to ChatGPT launch\nChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful\nLLMs before then, they were paid services and not particularly accessible or known to lay people.\nChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.\nIt is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia prior to November 30, 2022 was generated\nby an LLM.

Before\nclaiming AI was used, consider if Dunning–Kruger effect and confirmation bias is clouding your\njudgement. In particular, there are several somewhat commonly used indicators which are ineffective\n(and may even indicate the opposite) in LLM detection.\nPerfect grammar: While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency,\nmany editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See\nalso § Discrepancies in writing style and variety of English.)\n\"Bland\" or \"robotic\" prose: By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose\nprose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as \"robotic\" to\nthose unfamiliar with AI writing.[6]\nBizarre wikitext: While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with\ninvalid syntax for reasons explained in § Use of Markdown, they are not likely to generate\ncontent with certain random-seeming, \"inexplicable\" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones\nlisted on this page in § Markup).

Here are the three answers - conversational but professional, no AI tells, Bloom-centered:\n\n---\n\n## **1. How have your achievements and professional experience prepared you for this position?**\n\nFor eight years at Bloom I developed the exact skills this position needs. I documented 118 accelerator cycles across 16 countries, working with 1,011 teams. That meant writing concept notes, facilitation guides, assessment frameworks, and activity libraries under tight deadlines while coordinating across time zones. I know how to produce materials fast that practitioners can actually use.\n\nThe competency framework work translates directly. I spent years working with EntreComp and GreenComp - both European Commission frameworks structured like GCED. They all share the same DNA: competency areas, knowledge plus skills plus values, learner-centered approaches. I know how to take a framework and turn it into activities, assessment tools, and educator guidance. The GCED-NEQMAP synthesis work you need is exactly this.\n\nOn gender: HerMeNow was 100% women founders from Cameroon to Lebanon to Kenya. I designed the program with structural interventions, not just gender paragraphs. Remote-first to accommodate caregiving. Female-facilitated. Women-only cohorts. I published research on this for the Asfari Foundation with gender-disaggregated data.\n\nCross-cultural work: 16 countries over eight years taught me how to find universal pedagogical principles while respecting context. The Asia-Pacific GCED Network serves diverse settings. I have been doing this across Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nI have worked with UNESCO, UNDP, and Institut Français before. I understand editorial standards, review cycles, how to coordinate across stakeholders, and how to write for practitioners while meeting institutional requirements.\n\nThe APCEIU document says GCED teachers must be competent in global citizenship themselves. Bloom's methodology builds this. We help people see themselves as global citizens, think critically about global issues, respect diversity, and take local action with global support. I practice what GCED teaches.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Please describe any skills and competencies you have which may be of particular relevance to this position.**\n\nI can turn complex content into accessible formats quickly. Web articles under 250 words, thematic briefs under 7 pages, concept notes for multi-stakeholder meetings. I write for practitioners, not academics. Plain language, clear structure, evidence-based without jargon. These are the formats you need.\n\nCompetency framework translation is what I do. I take abstract frameworks (EntreComp, GreenComp, PERMAH, VIA Character Strengths) and turn them into practical tools. Learning activities. Assessment rubrics. Facilitation guides. The GCED-NEQMAP alignment requires this skill.\n\nGender analysis: I do not add gender paragraphs at the end. I design programs differently from the start. HerMeNow was 100% women. Remote-first so women with caregiving responsibilities could participate. Female-facilitated. I analyze data by gender. I identify barriers. I propose interventions that work in context.\n\nStakeholder coordination: At ITC I coordinated 44 interviews and workshops with 50+ stakeholders across government, NGOs, private sector, community organizations. I know how to gather input, synthesize feedback, produce materials diverse groups can use. The GCED Network has ministries of education, APCEIU, UNESCO regional offices. I have managed this before.\n\nCross-cultural pedagogy: A refugee program in Jordan looks different from a corporate program in Dubai, but the pedagogy stays consistent. I know how to design learning that honors context while holding core principles. This matters for materials serving Asia-Pacific.\n\nEvidence-based work: I published research for the Asfari Foundation. Quantitative analysis, literature review, clear recommendations. I know how to ground materials in research while making them actionable.\n\nUN systems: I have written for UNESCO and UNDP. I know the requirements. Politically neutral language. Inclusive terminology. Proper citations. Clean formatting. I can produce materials that pass review the first time.\n\nIndependent remote work: I have managed projects remotely for years. Curriculum in Iraq. Program documentation for Bloom. Research for foundations. I clarify requirements upfront. I build review buffers. I deliver on time.\n\n---\n\n## **3. How does this position align with your career expectations?**\n\nThis position lets me take what I learned building programs and apply it at a systems level.\n\nFor eight years at Bloom I worked directly with 1,011 teams across 16 countries. That taught me what works in the field. Now I want to influence how education systems integrate transformative learning at scale. GCED is not one more subject. It is a prism through which all education is considered. That is the kind of systems thinking I want to support.\n\nI have a master's in Learning Sciences and want to keep developing expertise in this area. Working with UNESCO Bangkok and APCEIU on GCED frameworks, assessment systems, and evidence synthesis lets me learn how competency-based education works at regional and national levels.\n\nMy work has been concentrated in SWANA and Africa. I am ready to learn about Southeast Asia and the broader Asia-Pacific context. Understanding how GCED is implemented across different cultural and political contexts will make me better at this work globally.\n\nAt Bloom we reached over a thousand teams. That matters. But this position contributes to systemic change. The materials I produce will inform national education policies, teacher training programs, assessment frameworks across a region. That is the scale I am moving toward.\n\nI want to work at the intersection of wellbeing, education, and social change. GCED integrates these. It develops whole people (cognitive, socio-emotional, behavioral competencies) who can address global challenges. That is the work I want to do long-term.\n\nI have worked with UN agencies as a grantee and short-term consultant. I want to deepen this and contribute more directly to international development goals. Target 4.7 is where education meets sustainability and peace. That feels right for where I want to focus.\n\nIf this consultancy goes well, I would be interested in longer-term collaboration with UNESCO or similar roles that shape transformative education policy.\n\n---\n\n**Key changes made:**\n- No em dashes (replaced with periods or commas)\n- Short, direct sentences\n- No promotional language\n- No \"-ing\" analysis phrases\n- No parallelisms or elegant variation\n- Bloom as central focus\n- Softened career arc (interested in deepening vs. explicit stepping stone)\n- Your actual reason (expand usefulness, policy work, broaden perspective)\n- Conversational but professional tone\n\nReady to submit?",

That is the work I want to do long-term.\n\nI have worked with UN agencies as a grantee and short-term consultant. I want to deepen this and contribute more directly to international development goals. Target 4.7 is where education meets sustainability and peace. That feels right for where I want to focus.\n\nIf this consultancy goes well, I would be interested in longer-term collaboration with UNESCO or similar roles that shape transformative education policy.\n\n---\n\n**Key changes made:**\n- No em dashes (replaced with periods or commas)\n- Short, direct sentences\n- No promotional language\n- No \"-ing\" analysis phrases\n- No parallelisms or elegant variation\n- Bloom as central focus\n- Softened career arc (interested in deepening vs. explicit stepping stone)\n- Your actual reason (expand usefulness, policy work, broaden perspective)\n- Conversational but professional tone\n\nReady to submit?",
