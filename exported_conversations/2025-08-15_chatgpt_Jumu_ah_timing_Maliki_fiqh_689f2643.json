      "content": "In **Maliki fiqh**, the key question is: did you catch enough of the **Jumuʿah** prayer to be counted as having performed it?  \n\n### 1. **Minimum for Valid Jumuʿah in Maliki Fiqh**  \nIn the Maliki school, you are considered to have caught the Jumuʿah prayer if you join the congregation **before the imam gives the salām** at the end of the prayer.  \n- If you arrive **before the imam finishes the rukūʿ of the second rakʿah**, you complete the prayer as normal and it counts as Jumuʿah.  \n- If you arrive **after** that point (e.g., the imam is already in sujūd or tashahhud of the second rakʿah), you will join, but then you must **pray Ẓuhr (4 rakʿahs)** afterwards, because in the Maliki view you didn’t catch Jumuʿah in time.\n\n### 2. **Arriving Before Iqāmah**  \nIf you arrive *before* the iqāmah is called for the prayer, you’ve certainly caught it. The iqāmah is made right before the imam begins, so being there means you will be there for the khutbah (if you came before the prayer started) or at least the prayer itself from the start.\n\n### 3. **About the Hadith on Missing Three Jumuʿahs**  \nThe hadith you’re referring to (“Whoever leaves three Jumuʿahs out of negligence, Allah will seal his heart…”) refers to **deliberately neglecting** Jumuʿah without excuse.  \n- If you caught the prayer as described above, it counts.  \n- If you missed it due to valid excuse (travel, illness, etc.), it’s not the same as negligent abandonment.  \n- The “hypocrite” warning is about repeated willful neglect, not about occasional lateness or catching it just in time.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also share the **exact Maliki source texts** that detail the minimum for catching Jumuʿah so you have a clear scholarly reference. Would you like me to bring those?",

      "content": "In **Maliki fiqh**, the ruling for *catching* Jumuʿah is not exactly the same as for the regular five daily prayers — and yes, there’s specific evidence they use.  \n\n---\n\n## **Maliki Position on Catching Jumuʿah**\n\n**Summary:**  \nYou must catch **one full rakʿah with the imam** (meaning: you joined before the imam rises from rukūʿ of the second rakʿah). If you catch less than that, you haven’t caught Jumuʿah — you pray Ẓuhr instead.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Evidence in Maliki Sources**\n\n#### 1. **Hadith of Abu Hurayrah**  \n> **\"Whoever catches one rakʿah of the prayer has caught the prayer.\"**  \n> — *Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī* (580), *Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim* (607)  \n\n- **Malikis** apply this to Jumuʿah as well, but with the condition that Jumuʿah is only valid if you catch one *full* rakʿah with the imam.  \n- If you enter **before the imam rises from rukūʿ of the second rakʿah**, you complete the second rakʿah with the imam and your prayer counts as Jumuʿah.  \n- If you join **after** that, the hadith means you caught the *time* of prayer, but not the Jumuʿah form — so you pray Ẓuhr.\n\n#### 2. **Practice of the Companions**  \nMaliki jurists cite narrations from the Companions (e.g., Ibn ʿUmar, Ibn Masʿūd) indicating that latecomers who missed a rakʿah on Jumuʿah would complete it as Jumuʿah, but if they missed more than a rakʿah they would pray Ẓuhr.  \n- See: **Ibn Abī Zayd al-Qayrawānī**, *al-Risālah*, section on Jumuʿah:  \n  > \"Whoever catches a rakʿah of Jumuʿah prays it as Jumuʿah, and whoever misses it prays it as Ẓuhr.\"\n\n#### 3. **Muwatta of Imam Mālik** – Book 5, Hadith 5.6.12  \n> Mālik said: “The sunna with us is that whoever catches a rakʿah of Jumuʿah joins it and adds another, and whoever misses both rakʿahs prays Ẓuhr in four.”\n\nThis is essentially the Maliki *proof-text* — it comes directly from Imam Mālik’s own statement of practice in Medina.\n\n---\n\n### **Why the Malikis are Stricter than ‘Any Part of Prayer’ View**\nSome schools allow Jumuʿah if you catch even the tashahhud, but the Malikis argue that Jumuʿah is a distinct prayer with its own minimum structure — two rakʿahs — and catching less than one rakʿah means you didn’t participate in it as legislated. The hadith “Whoever catches one rakʿah…” is taken literally here.\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can **quote the full Arabic text from the Muwatta and al-Risālah** so you have the exact Maliki evidences to show a scholar. That would make it crystal clear.  \n\nDo you want me to pull those next?",

      "content": "Here’s a breakdown of **what counts as “catching” Jumuʿah** in the four major madhhabs, side by side, with the main evidence each uses.  \n\n---\n\n## **1. Hanafi**\n- **Minimum:** You must catch **any part** of the Jumuʿah prayer before the imam says the *second salām* at the end.  \n- **If you arrive after:** You pray Ẓuhr instead.  \n- **Evidence:**  \n  - Hadith: *“Whatever you catch, pray it, and complete what you missed.”* (Bukhārī 635, Muslim 602)  \n  - Interpreted broadly — even catching tashahhud counts as catching the prayer.  \n- **Note:** They require at least three others for the prayer to be valid (imam + 3), so if you join them in that state, it counts.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Shafiʿi**\n- **Minimum:** You must catch **one rakʿah** before the imam rises from rukūʿ of the second rakʿah.  \n- **If you arrive after:** You pray Ẓuhr.  \n- **Evidence:**  \n  - Hadith: *“Whoever catches a rakʿah of the prayer has caught the prayer.”* (Bukhārī 580, Muslim 607)  \n  - Applied to Jumuʿah specifically.  \n- **Reasoning:** Jumuʿah has its own form (two rakʿahs), so catching less than a rakʿah doesn’t fulfill its minimum.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Maliki**\n- **Minimum:** Same as Shafiʿi — must catch **one full rakʿah** before the imam rises from rukūʿ of the second rakʿah.  \n- **If you arrive after:** You pray Ẓuhr.  \n- **Evidence:**  \n  - Practice of Medina as recorded by Imam Mālik (*Muwatta*, Book 5, Hadith 5.6.12).  \n  - Hadith: *“Whoever catches a rakʿah of Jumuʿah, let him add another, and his prayer is complete.”* (from Companion practice, authenticated in fiqh texts).\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hanbali**\n- **Minimum:** Must catch **one rakʿah** before the imam rises from rukūʿ of the second rakʿah.  \n- **If you arrive after:** Pray Ẓuhr.  \n- **Evidence:**  \n  - Same hadith as Shafiʿi/Maliki: *“Whoever catches a rakʿah of the prayer has caught the prayer.”*  \n  - Hanbalis interpret “prayer” here to include the special rules of Jumuʿah.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick Table**\n\n| Madhhab   | Minimum to Catch Jumuʿah | If Missed This | Basis |\n|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|-------|\n| Hanafi    | Any part before salām     | Pray Ẓuhr      | “Whatever you catch…” (Bukhārī/Muslim) |\n| Shafiʿi   | 1 full rakʿah             | Pray Ẓuhr      | “Whoever catches a rakʿah…” |\n| Maliki    | 1 full rakʿah             | Pray Ẓuhr      | *Muwatta*, practice of Medina |\n| Hanbali   | 1 full rakʿah             | Pray Ẓuhr      | “Whoever catches a rakʿah…” |\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also make you a **flow chart** showing *exactly* when you’ve “caught” Jumuʿah according to each madhhab, from walking in the door to the imam finishing. That would make the differences super easy to remember.  \n\nDo you want me to make that chart?",

      "content": "Ah — you’re talking about the **hadith describing the reward for arriving early to Jumuʿah**, where the Prophet ﷺ gave a vivid analogy of different levels of reward depending on how early you come.  \n\n---\n\n## **The Hadith**\nNarrated by **Abu Hurayrah** رضي الله عنه:  \n> *“Whoever takes a bath on Friday like the bath for janābah, then goes in the first hour, it is as if he sacrificed a camel; whoever goes in the second hour, it is as if he sacrificed a cow; whoever goes in the third hour, it is as if he sacrificed a horned ram; whoever goes in the fourth hour, it is as if he sacrificed a chicken; whoever goes in the fifth hour, it is as if he sacrificed an egg. When the imam comes out, the angels come to listen to the khutbah.”*  \n> — **Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī (881), Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim (850)**\n\n---\n\n### **Meaning**\n- **“Hours” here** don’t mean literal 60-minute hours, but divisions of the time between **Fajr** and the **start of the khutbah**.  \n- The **earlier you arrive**, the greater your reward — compared to offering increasingly smaller sacrifices.  \n- Once the imam comes out to start the khutbah, the “register” of those rewards closes — the angels stop writing the names of those coming for Jumuʿah and instead listen to the khutbah.\n\n---\n\n### **Relation to the Athan**\nIn the Prophet’s ﷺ time, there was **one adhan** for Jumuʿah, given **when the imam sat on the minbar**.  \n- In that practice, arriving **before** the adhan meant you were still in the angels’ record of early arrivals.  \n- In the time of ʿUthmān رضي الله عنه, a **second earlier adhan** was added in the marketplace to give people more warning — so “before the adhan” can now mean much earlier than khutbah time.\n\n---\n\n### **Bottom line for you today**\n- Coming right before the iqāmah means you caught the **obligation** (you fulfilled Jumuʿah in Maliki fiqh, so the “hypocrite” warning doesn’t touch you).  \n- But you **missed the extra reward tiers** of arriving earlier for the khutbah, which is a sunnah.  \n- The hadith’s “camel, cow, chicken” analogy isn’t about validity, but about **levels of reward and virtue**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can break down **exactly when in today’s clock time** each of those “five hours” would roughly fall according to the Maliki view of Jumuʿah time in your location. That way you can see when you’d need to arrive to “get the camel.”  \n\nDo you want me to do that?",
