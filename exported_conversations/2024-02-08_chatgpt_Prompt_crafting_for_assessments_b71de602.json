You are a large language model whisperer and you will first read and digest some best practices for prompt engineering here:\nPrompting tips:\nIn this lesson we look at the importance of prompts in AI content creation. I explain what AI prompts are and how they work, and highlights the various forms that prompts can take. The lesson also covers the importance of effective prompts in shaping the user experience and determining the usefulness of an AI system.\nHere I will also provide a hierarchical view of the structure of a prompt, starting with the general AI prompt components layer, followed by the element layer, and finally the recipe layer. The four key components of a great prompt are discussed in detail, including the task, instructions, context, and parameters/settings.\nBy understanding the structure and components of a prompt, you can craft effective prompts that will help you get the most out of your AI interactions. The lesson concludes by inviting you to dive into the world of prompting and create amazing AI interactions.\n\nThe Importance of Prompts in AI Content Creation\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way content is created, but the quality of the output is dependent on the quality of the prompt. A well-designed prompt can steer the AI model towards producing engaging, relevant and on-point content, whereas a poorly designed prompt will result in generic and lackluster output.\nRecently, the popularity of ChatGPT has brought attention to the field of Prompt Engineering, leading many to believe that “AI Prompts” only refer to the chat-style method used in ChatGPT.\nHowever, this couldn't be further from the truth. An AI prompt can take many forms, including natural language prompts, image prompts, or even audio prompts. Essentially, anything fed to an AI model from which it must produce output is technically a prompt.\nPrompts and prompting are critical aspects of AI content creation as they set the tone, style, and direction of the output. The prompt acts as a guide, shaping the final outcome and determining the success of the project.\nIn essence, the prompt acts as the paintbrush to the AI model's canvas. A skilled prompt engineer can turn a blank canvas into a masterpiece, just as a well-crafted prompt can transform an average AI-generated output into a compelling and persuasive composition.\n💡\nThe power of prompts in AI content creation cannot be underestimated. A well-designed prompt has the ability to elevate AI-generated content to new heights of excellence, producing work that is convincing, friendly, and highly targeted.\n\nWhat are “Prompts” and How Do They Work?\nAn AI prompt is a piece of text or information that serves as an instruction or command for the AI model. Whether we're asking a question, providing input, or directing the AI system to perform a specific task, a prompt is the key that allows us to communicate our intentions to the machine.\nThe prompt is the main means of communication between the user and the AI model, and its structure and content are critical to the success of the model in performing the desired task.\nIt's important to note that there are different types of AI models, each trained to specialize in specific types of input and output. This highlights the importance of understanding the different types of AI models and the unique prompting skills required to produce the desired output.\nFor instance, in the case of generative AI models, such as image generation models and large language models (LLMs), the prompt provides the model with the information it needs to generate a response. For image generation models, the prompt is typically a description of the image to be generated, while for LLMs, it can range from a simple question to a complex problem with multiple data inputs.\nHere are some of the more popular AI Models:\n1. GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer, Version 3): This model is trained to understand human language and is the model behind DALL-E 2 and ChatGPT.\n2. Codex: This model specializes in understanding computer code and can translate human language into computer code.\n3. Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model that is capable of generating detailed images based on text descriptions. It is a latent diffusion model, a type of deep generative neural network.\nHow Prompts Work\nGood prompts provide clear and concise input to the AI system, which then generates a corresponding output. The prompt acts as a guide or request, directing the AI system towards the desired outcome. The nature of the prompt can vary depending on the type of AI system and the task it's being used for.\nFor instance, in the case of a language model like GPT, the prompt might be a simple sentence fragment that the model is asked to complete. The AI system will then analyze the input, draw from its vast database of knowledge, and generate a continuation of the sentence that's most likely to align with the given context and meaning. (Well so it seems, but in essence the AI is just guessing what the next word might be based on the previous chain of words).\nIn another example, the prompt might be a set of instructions or parameters for an AI system used for image or video processing. The AI system will use these prompts to adjust its behavior and perform the desired task, such as recognizing objects in an image or detecting specific events in a video.\nThe Many Forms of Prompts\nAI prompts have evolved significantly over the years, with advances in language model and artificial intelligence technology leading to the development of more sophisticated and nuanced prompts.\nIn the early days of language model and AI, prompts were relatively simple, usually in the form of questions or basic commands. However, with the introduction of second and third-generation language models and text-to-image AI models, there has been a shift towards more thoughtful and meaningful prompts.\nWhile AI prompts can take many different forms, ranging from simple text inputs to complex text and image prompts, the most effective prompts are those that are well-designed and tailored to the specific task and desired outcome.\nWith the increasing capabilities of AI models, it is becoming increasingly important for prompt designers to consider the nuances and complexities of the task at hand and to design prompts that effectively communicate the task and provide the necessary information to the AI model.\nWho knows what prompts may entail in the future, they could be spoken word or even body language. The important thing to note is that the prompt provides the AI system with the information it needs to understand our request or command and generate an appropriate response.\nWhat Makes a Great Prompt\nAs AI technology continues to advance, many commercial AI systems are now capable of producing usable and decent output with pre-programmed and trained models. However, to truly stand out from the competition and deliver exceptional results, it's important to aim for not just a good prompt, but a great one.\nA good AI prompt is one that meets the user's intent and requires minimal post-processing and review. But a great AI prompt goes beyond this by not only satisfying the user's intent, but also exceeding their expectations. It opens up new possibilities and inspires the user to create unique and personalised content. Additionally, a great AI prompt requires little or virtually no post-processing, making the output more efficient and effective.\n\nGeneral Structure of a Prompt\nIf you want to make the most of your AI interactions, it's essential to understand the structure of a prompt.\nThe structure that I am about to present is a hierarchical one, and starts at a very general high level view showing the basic building blocks of any AI prompt. This is the top with component layer, a 30, 000 ft, generalized view of the prompt structure. This layer provides a foundation where we can build any type of prompt for any AI system.\n￼\nNext, the element layer, these are blocks that make up the components in the component layer. These elements are the building blocks of the prompt and help to define the task and provide the necessary information to the artificial intelligence (AI) model. Use these blocks to build your prompt recipes by specifying what information is needed. While the component layer offered us a very wide and general scope applicable to almost any AI model, the element layer is very specific to the AI model and platform you are using.\nThe next layer , the recipe layer, are specific combinations various elements or sub components of the AI prompt in a specific order to achieve a desired outcome. In this layer the various elements of the component layer are combined and ordered in a way that defines the task and provides the necessary information to the AI model. The order in which these elements are combined can greatly impact the outcome of the task, and it is important to consider the desired outcome when designing the recipe layer.\nThe prompt layer is where the AI prompt comes to life, and it is the result of the careful design and consideration of the previous layers. In the prompt layer, the prompt recipes created in the previous layer are combined with real-world data and objectives to create a prompt that is tailored to the specific task and desired outcome.\nNext we will end this lesson with a closer look at the component layer!\n\nAI Prompt Components Layer\nThis is layer can be seen as an abstraction layer. It is only intended give a generalization and framework foundation to the underlying AI model, and present a universal understanding of virtually any AI prompt.\nSome aspects maybe implied, such as in image generation models where the task is to create an image, but in LLM the task this maybe left up to the user to explicitly state. It is important to note, depending on the underlying AI Model, the order of elements may affect the output. This is precisely why we want would want to use such a model for a prompt.\n💡\nThis component level is universal for most contemporary AI systems within the foreseeable future. But that's the issue, foresight. However, should some textbased model suddenly rise up from the digital primordial soup, we will be prepared with ammendments in hand.\nHere's a closer look at the four components that make up a great prompt:\nTask\nThe task refers to the specific action or process that an artificial intelligence (AI) model is trained to perform in response to a prompt. It is the simplest form of a prompt. The task is the goal that you are directing the AI model to achieve. The task could range from answering a question to generating creative content, generating and image or writing a story or composing music (coming soon). As mentioned, tasks maybe implied by the model and not necessarily needed to be stated.\nAction Point: Think of the task as the output + topic. Ex \"write a social post on entrepreneurship\"\nInstructions\nBeyond the task, you need to give the AI system specific instructions to achieve the desired outcome. These can be simple or complex, and may cover the overall interaction, the attributes and qualities of the output, and even the format of the output.\nInstructions provide the AI model with a clear road map of what it needs to do, and they help ensure that the task is completed correctly and efficiently. Instructions can encompass the content you want the AI to include or build upon, as well as any do's and don'ts. And the specific steps or actions that must be taken to complete the task.\nFor example, if the task is to write a poem, the instructions could specify the length, rhyme scheme, and meter of the poem.\n💡\nAction Point: Think of the instructions as rules; Ex \"the poem must be written in first person. It must be at least 500 words.\"\nContext\nWhile instructions are specific steps or actions, or attributes of the output, that must be taken to complete the task, context refers to the background information or situation that surrounds a task. It provides the AI model with additional information about the task and helps it understands the situation and the goals of the task. The context maybe seen as guides and not strict rules\nThe context sets the stage for the AI system and provides information that helps it understands what you're after. This can come in the form of examples, images, or seeds that give the AI a better idea of the response you expect.\n💡\nAction Point: Think of the context as guidance and open for interpretation from the AI. For instance, \"write in a combination of voices from Barrack Obama or Steve Jobs\"\n💡\nDepending on the AI model and the task at hand it may not be necessary for a prompt to explicitly possess each component, indeed some may be optional, though we consider it good practice. This is where, depending on the AI model or system, the engineer can make his/her own judgment on the categorization of the components and elements into primary and secondary components.\nParameters/Settings:\nThese are specific elements or variables, that are either included in the prompt itself or set beforehand, that governs or directly affect the output of the AI model. These are usually meta-attributes or settings that likely cannot be set in plain language in the prompt.\nParameters can range from simple temperature and probability settings to more complex configurations specific to each AI model. Keep in mind that the available parameters and settings can vary greatly between AI systems, so it's important to familiarize yourself with what's available and experiment to find the right combination to meet your needs. In some AI models the parameters maybe used to define set instructions such “--no” parameter in MidJourney.\nInput\nThis is particularly important when the is specific subject matter for transformation. Inputs may or may not be required for the intended output. Input can include images for editing or to build on such as for “inpainting” and “outpainting”, for instance, in generative art and diffusion models, or it can be various amounts of text or text files in the case of LLM.\n\nExample Prompts\nBefore I bid you farewell and close this lesson off, it would not be fair to write a whole diatribe about prompts and not include a couple examples. So here are a few, first stated and then broken down to illustrate the pieces. In these examples the parameters are ignored for simplicity (trust me).\nGPT/ChatGPT Prompt Example 1\nUse the following idea to write a motivational article about mindfulness for entrepreneurs.

This approach ensures you'll achieve the most exceptional outcomes for your AI endeavours.\nDemystifying Prompting\nAt the heart of prompt engineering lies Prompting - the fascinating blend of art and science that involves designing and crafting text-based prompts in natural language for AI systems. This critical element bridges the human-AI relationship, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions with technology.\nA Foolproof, Step-by-Step Framework for Prompting Mastery\nWhile the AI landscape is ever-evolving, embracing a structured process empowers you to generate consistent, high-quality results. As you diligently apply this framework to each prompt you create, you'll evolve into a more effective and efficient prompt engineer. The icing on the cake? A clear and repeatable process minimizes trial and error, freeing up precious time and resources for other aspects of your work.\nMoreover, adhering to a process guarantees that your prompts consistently meet the quality standards and guidelines you've established. Ultimately, a well-defined process fuels better results, increased productivity, and success in the dynamic field of prompt engineering.\nA Glimpse into the Captivating Prompting Process\nThe prompting journey commences with defining your desired outcome, be it generating specific text or answering a particular type of question. Next, you'll design a prompt that propels the model towards this outcome, employing targeted keywords or phrases, providing context, or phrasing a question in a unique way.\nWith the prompt crafted, you'll dive into optimization through experimentation and iteration. By testing various prompt variations, gathering human evaluator feedback, and scrutinizing the model's output, you'll pinpoint the optimal prompt that delivers peak performance.\nThe significance of prompt engineering is immense. By fine-tuning prompts, we can elevate large language models' performance, making them invaluable for tasks such as generating high-quality text, answering questions, and even creating fresh content. In essence, prompt engineering is a pivotal factor in developing cutting-edge NLP systems and shaping AI's future.\nPrompting Langauge Considerations\nThe best type and manner of language to construct AI prompts is clear, concise, and specific. To create effective prompts, consider the following guidelines:\n1. Use plain language: Avoid jargon and complicated terms. Make your instructions easy to understand so the AI can quickly grasp your intent.\n2. Be specific: Clearly state your expectations and desired outcomes. Provide detailed information to help the AI generate accurate and relevant outputs.\n3. Maintain a logical structure: Organize your prompt in a coherent manner, so the AI can easily follow your instructions and provide the desired response.\n4. Include examples: If possible, provide examples to illustrate the type of output you're looking for. This can help the AI better understand your expectations and generate more accurate results.\n5. Consider the context: Tailor your prompt to the AI system and its capabilities. Be mindful of the platform or model you're working with, and ensure your instructions are compatible with its limitations and strengths.\nLanguage considerations: This is a big debate, but from our experience and the studies we have seen, using simple, concise English seems to be the best approach (as of the date of publishing). This may change in the future, but since LLMs are primarily built on English, it makes sense to use English. However, the latest generations of LLMs seem to be great at other major languages as well. As the field develops, we will advise professionals as necessary.\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you'll be able to construct AI prompts that effectively communicate your intentions and yield the desired outcomes.\nAn Overview of the AI Prompting Process\nAI Prompts comprise 5 primary components: Task, Instructions, Context, Parameters, and Input. Depending on the use case, not all components may be required. For instance, a simple AI prompt may only include the Task component.\n￼\nThese components remain relatively fixed and are not advised to be altered. Nevertheless, each component consists of various elements, such as the Task being composed of role, command, and topic. These elements can be adjusted, rearranged, and tailored to create distinct prompt \"recipes.\"\nElements and recipes allow for the application of one's skill and creativity. While these lessons offer standard elements appropriate for most scenarios, individuals are encouraged to infuse their personal touch. As one learns prompt engineering, adhering to the provided examples is recommended until greater proficiency is achieved.\nThe process entails decomposing tasks into components and elements, subsequently crafting an assortment of recipes to assess with the AI, and ultimately determining the optimal fit for the project. These recipes should be stored in one's prompt library for future utilization.\nThese recipes can be converted into actual prompts to be fed to the AI. For prompt engineers, this method serves as one of the most efficient ways to conceptualize, generate, and maintain prompts within one's prompt library.\nA Prompt Example\n￼\nThe Flow in Developing an effective AI Prompt\nLet's ignite our exploration by examining a sample prompt and uncovering its diverse components. We've crafted this recipe and example with ChatGPT 3.5/GPT-4 in mind, but fear not—flexibility is at your fingertips! You can effortlessly adapt the prompt or structure to cater to your unique requirements.\nRemember, your prompt needn't encompass all these elements and components; it's all about tailoring your approach to the system you're utilizing and the outcomes you desire. Study the table below, and join us as we unravel each facet of the prompt in the subsequent sections.\nStatement of Purpose: I want to be more helpful to my subordinates at work and help them grow.

This will be sent as a message to the person who is afflicted. The person you are writing to is in their 30s, single and alone.\nDeveloping AI Prompts for LLMs: Step 1 - Statement of Purpose\nBefore you start crafting your AI prompt, it's essential to briefly consider your goals, purpose, and desired outcome. This first step will help guide the subsequent steps in the process.\nYou may have some ideal examples of the output you'd like. Collect and keep these at hand.\nDon't overthink it - this statement doesn't need to be complicated, as refinement will occur throughout the following steps.\n💡\nA statement of purpose is not always necessary and it does not have to be repeated for every situation. The more complex or specific the desired output the more of these elements are necessary.\nFrom our example above we can see our statement is simple and not too complex, expressed in everyday terms and language:\nStatement of Purpose: I want to be more helpful to my subordinates at work and help them grow. One of the issues I have identified that some suffer with is imposter syndrome. I want to offer some helpful advice.\nDeveloping AI Prompts for LLMs: Step 2 - Define the Task\nAs you begin the process, it's essential to clearly define the task and its components. This foundational step is crucial for the success of your work.\nThink about the specific goals you want the AI system to achieve and the input data it will use. The task consists of several elements, such as Command or Query, the topic or subject, and the role or persona. For most modern LLMs, consider the role you want the AI to play for optimal results.\nRemember to be precise. Use clear verbs and words as if you were instructing a person. For instance, instead of saying \"Generate a blog post on skipping rope,\" say \"Write a blog post on how to skip rope.\"\n￼\nBy clearly defining the task, the AI system will understand its exact purpose and what information to search for. Nail this step, and you're on the path to successful AI prompt engineering.\nAgain referencing our example, for the task we defined as best as possible, in simple and concise language, the Task, which is composed of the role you want the AI to take, the actual command to execute and the general or specific topic you want to write on:\nTask\tRole\tYou must act as a motivational coach like Les Brown. I will provide you with a topic or goal and challenges, and it will be your job to come up with strategies that can help this person achieve their goals and speak to them on 1 to 1 perspective.\n\tCommand\tI want you to give me 5 main points on the following topic. Then I want you to write on each point.\n\tTopic\tThe Topic is: What are some ways to overcome imposter syndrome and feel more confident in my abilities?\nDeveloping AI Prompts for LLMs: Step 3 - Give the AI the Right Instructions\nDefine the ideal output: Be specific about the desired outcome from the AI system. Clearly outline the format and characteristics of the output to give the AI a proper understanding of your expectations.\nOutput Format and Structure: Think about the final use case and audience. Define the length, content type, and format of the final product. For instance, \"The article should be 2500 words, with each idea clearly stated in headers and a logical flow.\"\nOutput Characteristics: Define the tone, style, and level of detail, such as \"The article should be written in a friendly, inspiring, conversational tone using natural language.\"\nOutline the points and topics you want to be included: Provide the AI system with the information and topics necessary for the output. Specify any specific ideas or perspectives you'd like the AI to include.\n\"Do's and Don'ts\": Set boundaries for the AI. Offer guidelines and restrictions to ensure the output aligns with your expectations and avoids unwanted or problematic content.\nIdeal Input and Output Examples: Provide clear examples of the desired input and output. This helps the AI system understand the tone, style, and format you want for the output.\nIncorporate \"Ideal Input and Output Examples\" in your AI prompt engineering plan to ensure the AI system delivers relevant, high-quality, and tailored content that meets the specific needs and expectations of your target audience and use case.\n￼\nIn our example, we've identified the following elements for the instruction component:\n1. Output structure and format\n2. Qualities of the output\n3. Content\n4. Do's and Dont's\nWe've made sure to keep the language simple and concise to the best of our ability.\nInstructions\tOutput - Format, Structure\tEach point should have it's own headings.

Do not mention anything about yourself or your role.\nDeveloping AI Prompts for LLMs: Step 4 - Context: Additional Guidance for the AI\nAs a prompt engineer, you can enhance AI output by providing extra guidance. This goes beyond basic instructions and offers a deeper understanding of your unique requirements. By doing this, you ensure that the AI output is relevant, high-quality, and tailored to your needs.\nDesired Point of View or Perspective: Specifying the desired point of view is crucial for aligning the AI output with your vision. Think about your audience and the perspective that makes the most sense. Providing this context helps the AI create output that resonates with your audience.\nTarget Audience: Define your target audience before starting. Consider demographics like age, gender, location, interests, and values. This context helps the AI create output specifically for your audience. Don't forget about your audience's brand archetype, which guides the AI in creating output consistent with your audience's expectations.\nPurpose and Use Case: Defining the purpose and use case sets the direction and provides a roadmap for the AI. Specify the context in which the output will be used to ensure it meets specific requirements. This step is critical for producing output that's relevant, high-quality, and tailored to your needs.\nSupplementary Information and Data: Providing additional data and background information empowers the AI to create a unique, relevant, and high-quality output. More data also leads to greater accuracy, ensuring the output meets your specific needs and expectations.\n￼\nIn our example, we've outlined the following elements for the context component:\n1. Perspective\n2. Your goal\n3. Target Audience\nWe've ensured that the language remains simple and concise for optimal clarity.\n💡\nI hope you see a pattern here, simple and concise if very important when communicating with an AI.\nContext\tPerspective( you want the output to be composed from, the person you want the AI to take)\tWrite from the perspective of a motivational coach speaking one on one to a depressed and confused person.\n\tYour Goal (who are you, where will it be published etc.)\tThis will be sent as a message to the person who is afflicted.\n\tTarget audience\tThe person you are writing to is in their 30s, single and alone.\nDeveloping AI Prompts for LLMs: Step 5 - Parameters: Setting Expectations for AI\nIn AI prompt engineering, specifying the parameters of your model or platform is essential. It helps set clear expectations for the AI system, ensuring it understands the desired complexity, data processing, and output format.\nFor a machine learning model, specify the accuracy, confidence level, data processing, and computational resources. If you're using a platform, define the desired output format and specific features or functionality. For example, in a natural language generation platform, set the level of detail and complexity for the output. Some of these settings control how deterministic the model is when generating output. Generally, you want to keep these settings low if you are looking for exact answers and higher if you are looking for the model to be more creative.\nIn summary, the \"Parameters\" step allows you to dictate requirements and limitations for your AI system. Providing this information ensures your AI operates effectively and efficiently, producing the desired output in the correct format.\n￼\nIn our example, no parameters are specified since ChatGPT doesn't utilize them directly (at the time of writing). However, we'll explore additional examples in subsequent lessons, with other LLMs that may require parameter adjustments or fine-tuning.\n\nDeveloping AI Prompts for LLMs: Step 6 - User Input: Transforming Existing Content\nUser Input refers to the text or information you want to transform. While creating content from scratch may not require this, it's useful when refining existing content, such as an email draft to your supervisor. Providing the draft as input to the AI helps improve your email, resulting in a polished and professional message with a friendly tone.\nKeep in mind, user input is not a necessary part of the prompt, as it's only required when refining or working on pre-existing text or content.\nIn our example, we didn't specify any input because we aimed to generate content using ChatGPT's extensive knowledge.\n\nDeveloping AI Prompts for LLMs: Step 7 - Output Review and Commit\nThe final step in the Prompting Process is executing the prompt and reviewing the output. Compare the output to your initial expectations or examples of your ideal result. You may want to tweak your prompt recipe or copy the output to a word processor for further edits before sending it off.\nAt this point, you have three options:\n1. Refine the prompt: Work on the prompt until it meets your needs. You can either refine the original prompt or use additional prompts to improve the output (known as prompt chaining). For example, if you want words and headings highlighted but didn't include that in the original prompt, you can create a new prompt to achieve the desired outcome and incorporate it into the original prompt.\n2. Commit to Prompt Library: When you have a successful prompt recipe, add it to your prompt library with appropriate descriptions and any other relevant information.\n3. Human Review and Publish: Always review the output of an LLM, as there may be inconsistencies. Use tools like Grammarly to check spelling and grammar, and have someone else review the content if possible. Once completed, publish the content, whether it's an email, presentation, or article.\nRemember, there's a point of diminishing returns where spending more time on a prompt may not yield the exact result you had in mind. It's essential to find the right balance between prompt refinement and moving forward with the output.\nSummary & Conclusion: Mastering AI Prompt Engineering\nThe AI Prompting process is a crucial aspect of prompt engineering, involving designing and crafting text-based prompts for AI systems. By following a structured framework, you can effectively create and optimize AI prompts for various purposes. This includes defining the task, providing clear instructions, adding context, specifying parameters, and incorporating user input when necessary.\nBreaking down the prompting activity into components enables testing different permutations, ensuring the best outcome for your AI model. This comprehensive approach improves large language model performance and contributes to the development of advanced NLP systems and the future of AI.\nWith a solid grasp of prompt structure and process, you're ready for the next exciting lesson:\n\nMaster Prompt Engineering: Prompt Recipes - A Framework for Reusable AI Prompts\nDiscover the power of prompt recipes for AI tasks!

The four major ones are:\n1. Zero-shot prompting\n2. Few-shot prompting\n3. Fine-tuning\n4. Embedded Vector Search aka Embedding\nThe following graphic briefly summarises these approaches and when some you may need to explore them.\n￼\nA Summary and Guide on How to Approach an LLM Strategy\nZero-Shot Prompting\nLanguage models, especially large-scale ones like GPT-4, have revolutionized the way we approach natural language processing tasks. One of the most remarkable features of these models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning.\nThis means that the models can understand and execute tasks without having seen any explicit examples of the desired behaviour. In this section, we will explore the concept of zero-shot prompting and provide unique examples to illustrate its capabilities.\nExample 1:\nPrompt: Translate the following English text into French.\nText: The weather is beautiful today.\nOutput: Le temps est magnifique aujourd'hui.\nExample 2:\nPrompt: Summarize the main idea in the following text.\nText: The rapid growth of technology has led to significant advancements in various industries. From communication and transportation to healthcare and education, technology has played a crucial role in improving our lives. However, we must also be cautious of the potential negative effects, such as job loss due to automation and privacy concerns.\nOutput: Technology's rapid growth has positively impacted various industries but also raises concerns about job loss and privacy.\nIn the examples above, the model is given clear instructions without any demonstrations or examples. The zero-shot capability of the model allows it to understand the task and generate appropriate outputs.\nHowever, it's essential to note that zero-shot prompting may not always yield accurate or desired results. In such cases, few-shot prompting can be a more effective approach. By providing the model with demonstrations or examples, it can better understand the desired output and perform the task more accurately. In the next section, we delve into the concept of few-shot prompting and discuss its applications.\nFew-Shot Prompting\nFew-shot prompting enables large language models to perform better on complex tasks by providing demonstrations, but it has limitations in addressing certain reasoning problems, suggesting the need for advanced prompt engineering and alternatives like chain-of-thought prompting.\nWhile zero-shot capabilities have shown remarkable results, few-shot prompting has emerged as a more effective way to tackle complex tasks by utilizing different numbers of demonstrations, such as 1-shot, 3-shot, 5-shot, and so on.\nWhat is Few-Shot Prompting\nFew-shot prompting is a technique used to guide large language models (LLMs), like GPT-3, towards generating desired outputs by providing them with a few examples of input-output pairs. While few-shot prompting has shown promising results, there are limitations to this approach. This method allows for in-context learning by conditioning the model using examples, guiding it to produce better responses.\nExamples and Explanations of Few-Shot Prompting\nIn this section, we will delve into more detailed examples of few-shot prompting to better understand how it works and how it can be applied effectively.\nExample 1: Using a New Word in a Sentence\nTo demonstrate few-shot prompting, consider the following example from Brown et al. (2020) in which the task is to use a new word in a sentence correctly:\nPrompt:\nA \"whatpu\" is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses the word whatpu is: We were travelling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus. To do a \"farduddle\" means to jump up and down really fast. An example of a sentence that uses the word farduddle is:\nAI:\nWhen we won the game, we all started to farduddle in celebration.\nHere, the model has learned to perform the task by providing it with just one example (1-shot).\nExample 2: Sentiment Analysis with Random Labels\nIn this example, we will experiment with random labels for a sentiment analysis task:\nPrompt:\nThis is awesome! // Negative This is bad! // Positive Wow that movie was rad! // Positive What a horrible show! //\nAI:\nNegative\nDespite randomizing the labels, the model still produces the correct answer. This demonstrates the importance of format in few-shot prompting.\nExample 3: Complex Reasoning Task\nFew-shot prompting may struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning. For example, consider the following problem:\nPrompt:\nThe odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1.\nAI:\nYes, the odd numbers in this group add up to 107, which is an even number.\nThe response is incorrect, indicating that few-shot prompting may not be sufficient for this type of problem. Let's try to add more examples:\nPrompt:\nThe odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 4, 8, 9, 15, 12, 2, 1. A: The answer is False.\nThe odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 17, 10, 19, 4, 8, 12, 24. A: The answer is True.\nThe odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. A:\nAI:\nThe answer is True.\nAgain, the response is incorrect. This example demonstrates that few-shot prompting might not be enough to generate reliable responses for complex reasoning tasks. Instead, it might be more effective to use advanced prompting techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting, which involves breaking a problem down into smaller steps and demonstrating those steps to the model.\nThese examples illustrate the potential of few-shot prompting as a technique to improve the performance of large language models on various tasks. However, as the complex reasoning task example shows, it may not always be sufficient, prompting the need for advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.\nTips for Effective Few-Shot Prompting\n1. Label Space: Ensure the label space is well-defined and relevant for the task at hand, as it significantly affects the performance of few-shot prompting. Example Task: Sentiment analysis (Positive or Negative) Well-defined Label Space: Positive, Negative Example: \"The movie was fantastic!\" should be labeled as Positive.\n2. Input Text Distribution: Carefully consider the distribution of input text in the demonstrations, as it plays a crucial role in the model's ability to generalize to unseen examples. Example Task: Classify animals into categories (Mammal, Bird, Fish, Reptile, or Amphibian) Balanced Input Text Distribution: Provide an equal number of examples for each category in the demonstrations. Example: \"Kangaroo, Mammal; Penguin, Bird; Salmon, Fish; Iguana, Reptile; Frog, Amphibian.\"\n3. Format Consistency: Maintain a consistent format in the demonstrations, as it helps the model understand the task and generate better responses. Example Task: Translate English sentences to French Consistent Format: English sentence // French translation Example: \"Hello, how are you? // Bonjour, comment ça va?\"\n4. Random Labels: Interestingly, using random labels can lead to better performance than not providing any labels at all. This suggests that even with incorrect labels, the model can still learn from the structure and format of the demonstrations. Example Task: Sentiment analysis (Positive or Negative) Random Labels Example: Assign random labels to the input text and observe if the model can still generate correct answers. Demonstration: \"This is amazing! // Negative; What a terrible day! // Positive;\" Input: \"I had a great time at the party.\" Output: Even with random labels, the model may still classify the sentiment as Positive.\n5. True Distribution of Labels: Select random labels from a true distribution of labels (instead of a uniform distribution), as it can help the model better understand the problem and improve its performance. Example Task: Categorize news articles into topics (Politics, Sports, Technology, or Entertainment) True Distribution Example: Suppose the true distribution of labels is 40% Politics, 30% Sports, 20% Technology, and 10% Entertainment. Select random labels based on this distribution, rather than uniformly. Demonstration: \"Politics, Article A; Sports, Article B; Politics, Article C; Technology, Article D;\" Input: \"Article E\" Output: The model is more likely to generate accurate categorizations based on the true distribution of labels.\nThese tips, based on the findings of Min et al. (2022), can help enhance the effectiveness of few-shot prompting and enable AI models to generate more accurate and coherent responses.\nWhen to Use Zero-Shot & Few-Shot Prompting\nHere are some of the major instances where you would want to use the few-shot prompting methodology:\n1. Zero-shot prompting is insufficient: Large language models may have impressive zero-shot capabilities, but they can still struggle with more complex tasks. Few-shot prompting can help improve the model's performance on these tasks by providing additional context and examples.\n2. Limited training data is available: If you have a limited amount of labelled data for a specific task, few-shot prompting can help the model learn more effectively by leveraging the existing demonstrations.\n3. Fine-tuning is not feasible: When fine-tuning the model is not possible due to computational or data constraints, few-shot prompting can serve as an alternative to enhance the model's performance on a particular task.\n4. Rapid experimentation is needed: Few-shot prompting allows for quick experimentation, as it only requires a few examples to demonstrate the desired behaviour. This can help you iterate and test ideas more quickly than with other techniques.\nLikely Use Cases for Few-Shot Prompting\nFew-shot prompting has a wide range of applications across various domains, owing to its ability to improve large language model performance on complex tasks with limited examples. Some of the most likely use cases for few-shot prompting include:\n1. Natural Language Understanding (NLU): Few-shot prompting can be used to enhance NLU tasks such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and relationship extraction. By providing a few examples of the desired behavior, models can better understand and classify text based on context and specific requirements.\n2. Question Answering (QA): In the context of QA systems, few-shot prompting can help improve the model's ability to generate accurate and relevant answers to user queries by providing demonstrations of correct answers for similar questions.\n3. Summarization: Few-shot prompting can be applied to improve text summarization by providing examples of well-summarized content. This can help guide the model to generate more concise and informative summaries.\n4. Translation: For translation tasks, few-shot prompting can be employed to adapt large language models to specific translation styles or specialized domains with limited examples of the translated text.\n5. Code Generation: Few-shot prompting can be used to enhance code generation tasks by providing demonstrations of the desired output for a given input. This can help the model generate more accurate and efficient code based on the provided context.\n6. Creative Writing and Content Generation: Few-shot prompting can be applied to creative writing and content generation tasks, such as generating stories, articles, or marketing copy, by providing examples of the desired writing style, tone, or structure.\n7. Domain-specific Tasks: Few-shot prompting can be especially useful in niche domains where data is limited or costly to acquire. By providing a few examples of the desired output, models can be guided to perform tasks in specialized fields such as finance, law, medicine, or scientific research.\n8. Conversational AI: In the context of chatbots and conversational AI, few-shot prompting can be used to guide the model's responses to user queries, making them more context-aware, accurate, and coherent. By providing examples of desired conversational patterns, the model can generate more human-like interactions.\n9. Structured Output Generation: Few-shot prompting can be particularly useful for applications where the large language model's output must adhere to a specific format, contain particular information, or follow certain patterns. By providing demonstrations of the desired output structure, models can generate responses that meet these specific requirements. Some examples include:\n10. Data Extraction and Formatting: In tasks where information must be extracted from unstructured text and presented in a structured format (e.g., tables, lists, or key-value pairs), few-shot prompting can be used to guide the model in generating the desired output. Examples of formatted output can help the model understand the structure it should adhere to while extracting and organizing the relevant information.\n11. Template-based Content Generation: When generating content based on specific templates, such as legal documents, contracts, or business reports, few-shot prompting can help ensure that the model generates text that complies with the required format, structure, and language. Providing examples of properly formatted documents can help the model generate content that adheres to the established norms of the specific domain.\n12. Customized Reporting and Visualization: In applications involving the generation of customized reports or visualizations from raw data, few-shot prompting can be used to guide the model in presenting the information in a specific format or layout. By providing examples of desired report structures or visualization styles, the model can generate outputs that meet the user's requirements and preferences.\nThese use cases represent just a fraction of the potential applications for few-shot prompting. As large language models continue to evolve and improve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications for few-shot prompting across various industries and domains.\nImplementing Few-Shot Methodology within the Framework of Prompt Recipes\nPrompt recipes provide a structured approach to creating and reusing effective prompts for AI applications, ensuring consistent and repeatable results. To incorporate few-shot methodology within this framework, we need to consider the four key components of a prompt recipe: Task, Instructions, Context, and Parameters/Settings. Here's how few-shot prompting can be integrated into each component:\n1. Task: Clearly define the task you want the AI model to perform, focusing on the specific problem it should solve or the outcome it should achieve. With few-shot prompting, this task should be one that benefits from the addition of demonstrations or examples.\n2. Instructions: Provide clear and concise instructions to the model, outlining the desired behavior or output. For few-shot prompting, this should include one or more demonstrations of the task, illustrating how the model should perform the task based on the given examples. Ensure that the examples provided are representative of the task and cover diverse cases, if possible.\n3. Context: In the context component of the prompt recipe, include any background information, domain-specific knowledge, or relevant details that will help the model understand the task more effectively. When using few-shot prompting, the context may include the examples themselves, as well as any additional information that can help the model generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\n4. Parameters/Settings: Fine-tune the parameters and settings of the AI model to optimize its performance for the given task. For few-shot prompting, this might involve adjusting the number of shots (examples), experimenting with different input and output formats, or tweaking the model's temperature and token limit to control the randomness and length of the generated response.\nExample: Sentiment Analysis Using Few-Shot within a Prompt Recipe\nIn this example, we will implement a few-shot prompting methodology for a sentiment analysis task using the prompt recipe framework. The goal is to guide the AI model to classify input sentences as either Positive or Negative.\n1. Task: Sentiment analysis - classify sentences as Positive or Negative.\n2. Instructions: a.

Some of the most prominent large language models that have shown promising results with few-shot prompting include:\n1. GPT-3/3.5/4 (OpenAI): GPT-3, with its 175 billion parameters, has demonstrated remarkable performance in few-shot prompting. Its ability to understand the context and generate coherent responses makes it one of the best choices for this technique.\n2. BERT (Google): BERT is another large language model that can be effectively used with few-shot prompting, especially when fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n3. T5 (Google): The Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) is a versatile large language model that has shown strong performance across various tasks when used with few-shot prompting.\n4. XLNet (Google/CMU): XLNet is another large language model that can benefit from few-shot prompting, particularly for tasks like question answering and language understanding.\nWhile there seem to be new LLMs being released every week, ultimately, the choice of a large language model for few-shot prompting will depend on factors such as the specific task, data availability, computational resources, and the desired level of performance. It is essential to experiment with different models and settings to find the best fit for your particular use case.\n💡\nNo methodology works with every use case and every LLM. The key to finding the right prompt for the job is using your Prompt Recipes to continually test!\nLimitations of Few-Shot Prompting\nDespite its potential, few-shot prompting has limitations, particularly when dealing with complex reasoning tasks.\nIn this section, we will discuss the main challenges and drawbacks of few-shot prompting:\n1. Inconsistency: Few-shot prompting can sometimes yield inconsistent or unpredictable results. The model may generate high-quality responses in some instances while producing irrelevant or inaccurate outputs in others. The limited number of examples provided may not be sufficient to guide the model consistently.\n2. Sensitivity to Prompts: The performance of few-shot prompting is highly dependent on the quality and format of the prompts. Poorly designed prompts can lead to suboptimal results, and finding the most effective prompt can be a time-consuming and iterative process.\n3. Confabulation: Few-shot prompting may result in the model generating plausible-sounding but incorrect or fabricated information. This confabulation can make it challenging to rely on the model's outputs for critical applications, where accuracy and reliability are paramount.\n4. Lack of Fine-Grained Control: Few-shot prompting provides limited control over the model's generated outputs. While fine-tuning allows for more precise adjustments to the model's parameters, few-shot prompting relies on guiding the model through examples, which may not always produce the desired level of control.\n5. Scalability: Few-shot prompting can be resource-intensive, especially when working with large language models. The computational power required for processing multiple input-output examples may limit the scalability of this approach for large-scale or real-time applications.\n6. Inability to Learn New Information: Unlike fine-tuning, few-shot prompting does not inherently teach the model new information. It only guides the model to generate outputs based on the patterns it has already learned. This limitation can restrict the adaptability of the model to new domains or evolving requirements.\nFew-shot prompting is indeed a powerful technique for guiding LLMs, but it has its limitations. Understanding these challenges is essential for selecting the most appropriate method for a given task and for developing strategies to address the inherent drawbacks of few-shot prompting.\nOpting for Fine-Tuning When Few-Shot Prompting Falls Short\nIn some instances, few-shot prompting may not effectively address a specific use case or deliver the desired results. In such situations, fine-tuning becomes a more suitable option to tailor the large language model (LLM) to the targeted application.\nFew-shot prompting relies on providing the model with a handful of examples as context, allowing it to understand the desired output format and perform the task accordingly. While this approach can work well for many applications, certain tasks may require more nuanced understanding or domain-specific knowledge that few-shot prompting struggles to provide.\nFine-tuning, on the other hand, involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained model to improve its performance on a particular task. By supplying the model with a curated dataset of relevant examples, fine-tuning allows the LLM to generate more accurate and context-specific responses. This process is especially beneficial for tasks that demand a deeper understanding of domain-specific terminology, jargon, or unique context that may not be sufficiently captured through few-shot prompting.\nWhen considering fine-tuning as an alternative to few-shot prompting, it is crucial to acknowledge that this approach can be more time-consuming, computationally intensive, and expensive. However, when the need arises to tailor an LLM to a specific domain or task with greater precision, the benefits of fine-tuning often outweigh these challenges. This makes fine-tuning an essential technique for organizations and researchers aiming to leverage the full potential of LLMs, such as GPT-3, in their unique applications.\nTakeaway\nFew-shot prompting is a valuable technique that improves large language models' performance on complex tasks, but it has its limitations. For more reliable responses on problems that involve multiple reasoning steps, advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting should be considered. Additionally, fine-tuning the models and further experimenting with prompt engineering can lead to even better outcomes.\n\nTo start, Please write your summary of best practices and principles to use as a poet crafting an ideal prompt:",

      "content": "Crafting an ideal prompt for poetry using AI involves a thoughtful and structured approach that considers the unique capabilities and limitations of language models. Here are some best practices and principles to guide poets in creating effective prompts:\n\n### 1. **Clarity and Specificity**\n   - **Define Your Goal:** Clearly articulate the theme, mood, or subject of the poem you want to generate.\n   - **Be Specific:** The more specific the prompt, the more likely the AI is to generate relevant and focused content. For instance, instead of saying \"write a poem,\" say \"write a sonnet about the tranquility of nature in spring.\"\n\n### 2. **Incorporating Literary Elements**\n   - **Style and Form:** Specify any desired poetic form (e.g., sonnet, haiku) or stylistic elements (e.g., rhyme scheme, meter).\n   - **Imagery and Metaphors:** Encourage the use of vivid imagery or specific metaphors that resonate with the poem's theme.\n\n### 3. **Setting the Tone and Voice**\n   - **Tone and Mood:** Indicate the desired emotional tone (e.g., melancholic, joyful) and mood to guide the AI's language choices.\n   - **Perspective and Voice:** Define the narrative voice or perspective, whether it's first person, third person, or a specific character's viewpoint.\n\n### 4. **Contextual Guidance**\n   - **Provide Context:** If the poem relates to a particular context or background story, include this information to guide the AI's creativity.\n   - **Use Examples:** Providing examples of similar poems or styles can help the AI understand the desired output.\n\n### 5. **Creative Constraints**\n   - **Employ Constraints:** Setting constraints, like a word limit or a theme limitation, can foster creative and focused poetry.\n   - **Challenge the AI:** Encourage the AI to explore unique or unconventional ideas within the poem's theme.\n\n### 6. **Iteration and Experimentation**\n   - **Iterative Approach:** Be prepared to refine the prompt based on the initial outputs. Iteration can significantly improve the final poem.\n   - **Experiment:** Try different variations of your prompt to see how subtle changes can impact the generated poem.\n\n### 7. **Balancing AI Capabilities and Human Touch**\n   - **Understand AI Limitations:** Be aware of the AI’s limitations in understanding nuanced human emotions and abstract concepts.\n   - **Human Intervention:** Use the AI-generated poem as a starting point and infuse your personal touch to finalize the piece.\n\n### 8. **Ethical and Cultural Sensitivity**\n   - **Avoid Sensitive Topics:** Be mindful of ethical considerations and cultural sensitivities when crafting prompts.\n   - **Originality:** Strive for originality in your prompts to generate unique and creative poems.\n\n### 9. **Utilizing Few-Shot or Zero-Shot Learning**\n   - **Leverage Few-Shot Learning:** For more complex themes, use few-shot prompting by providing examples of the desired output.\n   - **Zero-Shot for Exploration:** Use zero-shot prompting to explore different styles and themes without specific examples.\n\n### 10. **Feedback and Refinement**\n   - **Evaluate Output:** Critically assess the AI-generated poems and use this feedback to refine future prompts.\n   - **Collaborative Creativity:** View the process as a collaboration between your creative vision and the AI’s capabilities.\n\nBy adhering to these principles and continuously refining your approach, you can effectively harness AI as a tool for poetic expression, expanding the boundaries of your creative work.",

      "content": "Including a new competency, \"Mobilizing Others,\" with all its threads into the same prompt is a comprehensive task. Since your goal is to create a detailed and nuanced competency-based assessment, a few-shot approach would be more suitable. This approach allows for the inclusion of multiple examples (threads in each competency level) to guide the AI in understanding the complexity and depth of each competency. A few-shot approach is especially beneficial in this context as it helps in better capturing the nuances of each thread at different levels of expertise.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while longer prompts can provide more context and detail, they also need to be structured carefully to maintain clarity and focus. Given the complexity and length of the information, breaking down the prompt into manageable sections is crucial. \n\nHere's how the revised prompt, including the \"Mobilizing Others\" competency with its threads, can be structured:\n\n### Revised Prompt with New Competency:\n\n\"Expand the structured competency-based assessment table for online entrepreneurship students, already aligned with the EU's EntreComp framework, to include the new competency 'Mobilizing Others'. This competency should be integrated alongside the existing levels of expertise: Level 1 (Inception & Exploration), Level 2 (Experimentation & Action), Level 3 (Skill Enhancement), Level 4 (Collaboration & Complexity), and Level 5 (Transformation & Innovation). For each level, provide evidence examples that demonstrate the development of the 'Mobilizing Others' competency, ensuring that all threads (Inspire and Get Inspired, Persuade, Communicate Effectively) are represented at each level. The evidence should be digital or digitizable, such as project reports, leadership role documentation, persuasive presentations, etc., tailored to demonstrate skills in communication, persuasion, negotiation, and leadership.\n\nAs with the Creativity competency, use the following format:\n\n- Competence: Mobilizing Others\n  - Level 1: Inception & Exploration\n    - Example Evidence: [List of evidence types specific to Level 1 threads]\n  - Level 2: Experimentation & Action\n    - Example Evidence: [List of evidence types specific to Level 2 threads]\n  - ... [Continue for Levels 3, 4, 5]\n\nEnsure that the evidence types for each level are specific, concrete, and diverse, accurately reflecting the progression from foundational to expert skills in mobilizing others.\"\n\n### Example Format for \"Mobilizing Others\" Competency:\n\n| Competency Level | Evidence for Mobilizing Others |\n|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Level 1: Inception & Exploration | Documented instances of inspiring peers, initial persuasive communications |\n| Level 2: Experimentation & Action | Recorded pitches, evidence of successful persuasion in small-scale projects |\n| ... | ... |\n\nThis prompt ensures that the AI understands the need to address each thread within the \"Mobilizing Others\" competency across all levels of expertise. The examples given for each level will guide the AI to provide relevant and specific evidence types, ensuring a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the competency.",

To guide the LLM in generating thematic attempts for evidence lists corresponding to each level of the \"Mobilizing Others\" competency, it's essential to create a prompt that clearly delineates the task, including the need to address all threads across different levels. Here’s how we can structure the prompt:\n\n### Structured Prompt for the LLM:\n\n\"Develop five thematic attempts to create evidence lists for the 'Mobilizing Others' competency, part of an online entrepreneurship program aligned with the EU's EntreComp framework. Each thematic attempt should provide unique and digital or digitizable evidence types that demonstrate proficiency in 'Mobilizing Others' across five levels of expertise: Level 1 (Inception & Exploration), Level 2 (Experimentation & Action), Level 3 (Skill Enhancement), Level 4 (Collaboration & Complexity), and Level 5 (Transformation & Innovation). Ensure that the evidence addresses all threads of the competency: 'Inspire and Get Inspired', 'Persuade', and 'Communicate Effectively'. The thematic attempts should offer diverse and creative perspectives on how students can showcase their development and mastery in each area.\n\n### Themes for the Attempts:\n1. **Digital Leadership Journey**: Focus on digital evidence showcasing leadership and persuasion skills.\n2. **Creative Communication Strategies**: Emphasize innovative methods of effective communication and inspiration.\n3. **Collaborative Endeavors Evidence**: Highlight teamwork, negotiation, and collaborative project management.\n4. **Personal Growth and Impact**: Center on personal development, mentoring, and the impact on others.\n5. **Innovative Mobilization Techniques**: Explore cutting-edge approaches to mobilization, persuasion, and leading change.\n\n### Format for Each Thematic Attempt:\n\nFor each thematic attempt, provide evidence examples for each level of the 'Mobilizing Others' competency:\n\n- **Digital Leadership Journey**\n  - Level 1: [Evidence examples]\n  - Level 2: [Evidence examples]\n  - ...\n  - Level 5: [Evidence examples]\n\n- **Creative Communication Strategies**\n  - Level 1: [Evidence examples]\n  - ...\n  - Level 5: [Evidence examples]\n\n... [Continue the same format for the remaining themes]\n\nEach example should be specific, concrete, and illustrate the student's abilities and growth in mobilizing others according to the level of expertise.\"\n\n### Note to the LLM:\n- The evidence examples should be practical and achievable within a virtual learning environment.\n- Ensure diversity and uniqueness in the evidence types across different themes and levels.\n\nThis prompt guides the LLM to create a comprehensive and multi-dimensional assessment structure for the \"Mobilizing Others\" competency. It emphasizes the need for diverse, practical, and relevant evidence that aligns with each level's requirements and the thematic focus of each attempt.",

      "content": "To create a generic, reusable prompt that can accommodate various competencies and their respective threads, we need a prompt structure that guides the LLM to understand and adapt to different competency frameworks. This structure should be flexible enough to insert any competency and its threads while maintaining the integrity of the task.\n\nGiven the complexity and variability of competencies, a two-step, few-shot approach is more practical and effective:\n\n### Step 1: Extract Threads and Generate Example Ideas\nFirst, the LLM is guided to understand the specific threads of a new competency. This step involves generating initial ideas for evidence types based on these threads.\n\n#### Prompt for Step 1:\n\"Given the following competency and its associated threads, generate initial ideas for types of evidence that could demonstrate proficiency in each thread at different levels of expertise. The competency framework is as follows:\n\n- Competency: [[Insert Competency Here]]\n- Threads:\n  - Thread 1: [[Description]]\n  - Thread 2: [[Description]]\n  - ...\n  - Thread N: [[Description]]\n\nProduce a list of diverse and practical examples of evidence that students could provide to demonstrate their skills and growth in each thread of this competency.\"\n\n### Step 2: Create Detailed Evidence Lists Across Five Levels\nOnce the LLM has generated initial ideas, the second step involves creating detailed evidence lists for each level of expertise within the competency.\n\n#### Prompt for Step 2:\n\"Based on the initial ideas generated for the '[Insert Competency]' competency, develop a comprehensive list of evidence for five levels of expertise. These should align with the typical progression in the EntreComp framework: Level 1 (Inception & Exploration), Level 2 (Experimentation & Action), Level 3 (Skill Enhancement), Level 4 (Collaboration & Complexity), and Level 5 (Transformation & Innovation). Ensure that the evidence is diverse, digital or digitizable, and clearly demonstrates the development of skills pertinent to each thread of the competency.\"\n\n### Reasoning Behind the Approach\n1. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: This two-step approach allows for the prompt to be easily adapted to different competencies and threads. It's versatile and can be reused for various competency frameworks.\n\n2. **Depth and Breadth**: By initially focusing on understanding the threads and generating example ideas, the LLM can better grasp the nuances of each competency. This leads to more thoughtful and relevant evidence generation in the second step.\n\n3. **Structured Yet Open-Ended**: The prompts provide structure but are open-ended enough to apply to a range of competencies, encouraging creative and tailored responses from the LLM.\n\n4. **Ensures Thoroughness**: Breaking down the task into two steps allows for a more thorough exploration of each competency, ensuring that all threads are adequately addressed.\n\n### Reusable Generic Prompt Template\n1. **Step 1 Prompt**: \"Generate initial ideas for types of evidence for the following competency: [[Insert Competency and Threads Here]].\"\n\n2. **Step 2 Prompt**: \"Develop a comprehensive list of evidence types for five levels of expertise for the '[Insert Competency]' competency, ensuring alignment with its threads and levels of the EntreComp framework.\"\n\nThis approach provides a template that can be easily modified for various competencies, making it a valuable tool for your assessments.",

Let's break this down and propose improvements.\n\n### Evaluation Against Derived Principles\n\n#### Principles Adhered to Well:\n1. **Clarity and Specificity**: The prompt clearly states the task, framework alignment (EU's EntreComp), and the requirement for digital or digitizable evidence. \n2. **Structured Layout**: The prompt provides a structured approach to creating a competency table, including levels of expertise and thematic rows.\n3. **Inclusion of a Concrete Example**: The use of the 'Creativity' competency as a reference model aids understanding and consistency.\n4. **Step-by-Step Thinking Process**: Asking the AI to articulate its thought process enhances transparency and aligns with the principle of methodical task breakdown.\n\n#### Principles Lacking or Needing Improvement:\n1. **Brevity and Conciseness**: The prompt is quite lengthy and detailed, which might affect its usability and the AI's ability to focus on key aspects.\n2. **Flexibility for Different Competencies**: While the prompt is designed to be adaptable, it could be challenging to apply it seamlessly to a wide range of competencies without modifications.\n3. **Encouraging Creativity and Diversity in Responses**: The prompt might overly rely on the 'Creativity' example, potentially limiting the AI’s innovation in generating new evidence types.\n4. **Feedback Mechanism Integration**: While feedback is requested at the end, the prompt could better facilitate ongoing, iterative input throughout the process.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1. **Streamline the Prompt**: Shorten and simplify the language where possible, focusing on the essential elements of the task. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clearer structure.\n   \n2. **Enhance Flexibility**: Include a brief guideline on how to adapt the prompt for different competencies. This could involve instructions on replacing certain parts of the prompt with new competency details.\n   \n3. **Stimulate Diverse Responses**: Encourage the AI to think beyond the 'Creativity' example by adding a line like: \"While using the 'Creativity' example as a reference, feel free to propose innovative and diverse types of evidence that might uniquely apply to the new competency.\"\n   \n4. **Iterative Feedback Integration**: Modify the prompt to encourage feedback at each major step. For instance, after the AI outlines its understanding of the task and competency, it could ask for confirmation or additional input before proceeding to the next step.\n\n### Incorporating Changes\n\nThe revised prompt should be concise yet comprehensive, flexible enough to accommodate various competencies, and encourage creative input from the AI. Iterative feedback should be integrated to enhance the human-in-the-loop approach, ensuring that the final output is tailored and relevant. By making these adjustments, the prompt will align more closely with our derived principles, resulting in a more effective and efficient tool for competency assessment development.",
