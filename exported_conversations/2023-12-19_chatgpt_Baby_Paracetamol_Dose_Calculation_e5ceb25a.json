      "content": "For a 6.6 kg baby, the appropriate dose of 2.4% Paracetamol solution can be calculated based on the recommended dosage guidelines. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for precise and safe dosing, as dosages for infants depend on various factors including age, weight, and overall health. \n\nThe general guideline for Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) in infants is 10-15 mg/kg/dose, given every 4-6 hours. However, do not exceed 5 doses in 24 hours. To calculate the dose in milliliters (mL), use the concentration of the solution (2.4%, which is 24 mg/mL) and the baby's weight in kilograms.\n\nLet's calculate the dose.",
