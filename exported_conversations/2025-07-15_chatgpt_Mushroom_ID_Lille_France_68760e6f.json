      "content": "Thanks for sharing the images — based on the shape, coloring, and growth pattern (on rotting wood in a forested area near Lille, France in July), here's an educated guess:\n\n### Tentative ID: **Pluteus species**, possibly *Pluteus cervinus* (commonly known as the **Deer Mushroom** or **Fawn Mushroom**)\n\n#### Identification Features:\n- **Habitat**: Grows on rotting wood — check ✅\n- **Cap**: Often light brown, greyish, or tan with a slightly darker center, sometimes a wrinkled or fibrous texture — matches Image 1\n- **Gills**: Free from the stem, pinkish to brown-pink as spores mature — suggested in Image 2\n- **Stem**: Smooth and pale, no ring, and fairly central — visible in Image 2\n- **Spore print**: Pink to salmon (not visible in image but diagnostic if confirmed)\n\n---\n\n### Key Characteristics to Double-Check (for more certainty):\n1. **Spore print color** (Place cap gill-down on white and black paper overnight)\n2. **Smell** – mild or radish-like?\n3. **Cap texture** – fibrous or smooth when touched?\n4. **Gill attachment** – are they truly free from the stem?\n\n---\n\n### Similar Species:\n- **Pluteus salicinus** – has a more bluish tint, sometimes with mild psychoactive compounds (do not consume).\n- **Entoloma spp.** – similar pinkish gills but grow in soil, not wood, and often have angular spores.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Caution:\nNever eat wild mushrooms without **microscopic confirmation or expert consultation**. Many wood-loving mushrooms look similar — e.g., *Galerina marginata* (deadly toxic) also grows on rotting wood and can resemble edible species.\n\nWould you like a checklist to confirm key traits in the field or lab (spore print, microscopy, smell, etc.)?",

If it’s **pink** → *Pluteus* genus confirmed.\n2. **Watch bruising area over an hour**: Keep it in the light and observe changes.\n3. **Microscopy or DNA sequencing** (only if you’re seriously trying to ID psychoactive fungi).\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Final Note:\nBecause *Pluteus salicinus* is mildly psychoactive, but many similar species are **not**, and a few **lookalikes can be toxic**, **do not consume** unless you're 100% certain — especially with faint or ambiguous bluing.\n\nLet me know if you’d like help setting up a spore print or comparing with other known *Pluteus* species (e.g., *P. cyanopus*, *P. petasatus*).",

If brown, white, or black: ❌ Not *Pluteus* |\n| **Gill attachment** | Free from the stem — no connection or notch |\n| **Gills** | Start pale, turn pinkish with age |\n| **Cap color** | Silvery-gray, bluish-gray, sometimes greenish. Moist caps may appear slimy |\n| **Cap texture** | Smooth, slightly sticky when fresh |\n| **Stem** | No ring, pale to grayish, often darker toward base, sometimes bruises blue or greenish-blue |\n| **Bruising** | Bluing on gills, cap edge, or base of stem within ~30 minutes of handling |\n| **Habitat** | Grows on **decaying hardwood** (especially willow, alder, poplar) — not on soil or conifers |\n| **Odor** | Mild, sometimes mealy (like flour or cucumber) — not pungent or sweet\n\n---\n\n## 🚩 Red Flags That Suggest It’s **Not** *Pluteus salicinus*\n\n| Observation | Possible Issue |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| **Spore print is white, brown, or black** | ❌ Not *Pluteus* |\n| **Gills are attached to the stem** | Could be *Entoloma* (some are toxic) or other genus |\n| **Cap has a strong, unpleasant odor** | Not typical of *Pluteus*; might indicate toxicity |\n| **Cap is brightly colored (orange, red, etc.)** | Could be a toxic *Galerina* or *Cortinarius* |\n| **Presence of a ring or volva** | ⚠️ Could be *Amanita* — includes **deadly** species |\n| **Fruiting on soil or in grass, not wood** | Likely not *Pluteus* |\n\n---\n\n## ☠️ Toxic Lookalikes Worth Knowing\n\n| Species | Key Differences | Toxic? |\n|---------|------------------|--------|\n| **Galerina marginata** | Brown cap, rusty-brown spores, ring on stem, grows on wood — **deadly** | ☠️ Yes — contains amatoxins |\n| **Entoloma spp.** | Gills may appear pink but are **attached**, often have angular spores | ⚠️ Some are toxic |\n| **Inocybe spp.** | Often has fibrous cap, unpleasant odor, grows in soil — muscarine toxin | ⚠️ Yes |\n| **Cortinarius spp.** | Rusty-brown spores, partial veil (cobwebby cortina), not on wood | ☠️ Some deadly |\n| **Mycena spp.** | Tiny, fragile, white spores | ✘ Not toxic, but not a match |\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Best Ways to Confirm *Pluteus salicinus*\n\n1. **Pink spore print**\n2. **Free pinkish gills**\n3. **Growing on hardwood**\n4. **Bluing (even subtle) on bruising**\n5. **No ring, no volva, no veil remnants**\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Optional Advanced Steps (if you're curious)\n\n- **Microscopy**: *Pluteus* species have **pleurocystidia with apical hooks** (horned tips)\n- **Chemical reaction**: Psilocybin oxidizes to blue compounds — if in doubt, crushing and observing over time helps\n\n---\n\nLet me know how the spore print turns out!
