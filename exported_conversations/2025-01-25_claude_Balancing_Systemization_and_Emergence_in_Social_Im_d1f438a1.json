            "extracted_content": "I want to produce the essay that's stuck inside here, I want to write it for Munir and Dara my cofounders at Bloom.pm and help them see why I am convinced that we need emergent approaches, we need good people and trust that they will do beautiful things - not good systems that we attempt to shape people through. That the suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the masters house with the masters tools is becoming clearer and clearer to me and that I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people like ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. That it's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful, as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror, and that honor and dignity is worth more than continued funding from donors that don't trust us to treat us well. That even the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care, our connection, we need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful, a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. Something about relationship that we've been ailienated from - we text we don't call, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands and have systems with drop off at every stage vs the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres, and through them to their spheres, and beyond, through our connection with mentors we can transmit these new ways of seeing, these lived values, not as a list, as a lived experience and that is how we can trust that they get it. We will know, because we will see/feel it in our interactions iwth them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right, they will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality, we need to see them with the eye of quality, the eye of Goodness, Truth and Beauty, the eye that knows these things. And then we can have scalable systems, those people can impact the others, rather than think about scale in breadth - showing people how many people have jobs or planted trees - we need to get more comfortable with depth. how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change vs one which has \"good impact\" - impact, the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor, or an asteroid on the earth reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days, things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing. The idea of developing skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know, and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something, what if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and to access what their hearts are calling them towards? What if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out rather than pushing funding, expendatures, and movement that may be adding friction, doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone, with so much friction we certainly can burn people out (and have seen that on our own teams... what are we really doing?) why do we talk about wellbeing and stress - what if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community. We can move fast later, when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, I know you worry about the business failing, and that's ok, I sort of think that business might need to go. I don't know if you believe though, as I do, that good things live, true things find their homes, and that if we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and if we really focus on what is the problem that moves us, what brings us to life truely and sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood\" - i think we'll find something. It might be small, who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while, although I don't think that's so bad. What if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\" - perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world, maybe we need time to reflect and can work like einstien did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling isn't the time to rush, maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things... perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what i've been doing. i've been thinknig about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. the ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most \"effective\"\" - It's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate - Initially I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things - that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance. And still I think that externally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident, and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me - if you think about it, you will use your will to compell your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal, your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors (ends justify the means, think about it, especially when you are willing to use yourself as the means, of course anything can/should justify it. It's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when i was younger, when I was inspired by father greg boyle - when they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed, or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, care - these are all ends. Reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not percieved by the eye of rationality. THey are percieved by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, what beauty is, that eye is the one that I would like to cultivate. The neichze quote, he with a strong enough why can overcome any how guides me here, people who love have climbed mountains \"there ain't no mountain high enough\" there ain't no ocean vast enough, to keep them away from the beauty they want to do, babe. This is a real reason, this is a source of persistence, vitality, passion to knock on the thousand doors till one opens, this is the reason they'll leave our heart based aliveness focused program and join Ycombinator and get what they need financially, or figure something totally new and unexpected out. I'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, about the upside down pyramid, about start with why, about character strengths about come alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness based stress reduction for some people to better be able to manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. it's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct, what about that is meaningful for us that' sbeing lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echos within you. Those emotions are treasures and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra. Each tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist and sink into what we're doing and not be attached. Contentedness is not an emotion, it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing thigns and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small bold action. Similar to the zone that is described by the flow state where our skills are at the  edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at - we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of the calls. This means trust, implies process, moves people, businesses, projects and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future and planned. it's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise, it's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keep us alive(palestinians and lebanese) we saw how let down the people who can see this hypocracy felt. It's so true though, the goals, the SDGs, the plans, these things are dead on arrival, the reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on attainment of something. I know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact I'm confident, perhaps since you've known me for long enough you might accept it a bit more, yet for me it took me a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with aristotle and the idea of classification Historical Origins: Aristotle’s metaphysics focusing on cause-and-effect relationships (final cause, material cause ... percolate like water through the grounds of western culture and get amplified by the mechanistic thinking of the Scientific Revolution (Descartes, Newton) - I'm just a brain watching a world of parts interact sort of system thinking, Hobbes, oh crap christians are killing each other we're totally horrible and we need a rational govornment to put things in order, systems should be what we follow not people, enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, ladeeda democratic american let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion etc etc we live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that gallelio said is the perfect way to describe the world and it can all be displayed as a nice little info graphic - the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of conciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria and let's go fix that because death is bad, what about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about, probably, or even understand the impact of the history of ideas)  had. That we're here because of someone elses war freaking people out, our systems which destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans (and if there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to more efficiently achieve goals, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes? who cares if we breed them to be able to be transported across the ocean and have no idea what that does to the flavor, let alone nutritional profile, we must use these fear based epistemologies and ontologies that see the world full of nasty brutish people who will die shortly, unless we use our reason to align with the reason of the natural world, to break it up into leeetle pieces and use it to our favor, and BTW, the people who think like this, are more likely to be skiing inth alps and owning the businesses than running it. Also their kids don't go to Public schools and get graded like screws and meat of varying quality, by th way, I'm more of a B/B+  sort of person than a Grade A, so here doing this thinking is a bit out of my weight class, yet I digress and I try anyway to help you see, feel and understand this foundational thing. It's NOT about the wrong goals, profit or SDGs, it's not even about the systems leveraging personal and professional growth to help transform the economic system into one that's better ofr people and planet, no it's about the way of seeing and understanding what a person is, what the world is, and the systems that emerge from that understanding. Our neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is sort of hard to argue with, market efficiency sort of works, so does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core, we can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy and resources and food all commodities which the markets manage valuing perfectly well. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short sighted efficiency of materiality. I've tried not to say God in this runon paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of instagram, or a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country - little pin ball bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love, that's some oxytocin and some seretonin floating around a blood stream in a body that wants to keep it's bodily integrity intact so that it can propogate itself and not die. You cannot learn darwins theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty, don't you know. There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this, you may have even felt this, if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost. These things have been bugging me for a long time, I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children, full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it, at our own expense. Sure this is all fine said typing on a macbook pro made by a capitalist company with 216 billion dollars in cash reserves, benefitting from the international trade that brings me coffee from etheopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe. Yet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness is and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that. A little each day, weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet ... somehow I think that goes against my point here. That we need to see each other, even our messy each other. That this is from my heart to yours, I'm writing this with you Dara and you Munir in mind. It's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey - where I've felt off, yet I aquiessed allowing my doubt in my own feeling to fester. I thought, maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way, maybe I'm wrong, maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do, that the upside down pyramid, self efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, 1-1s, 1% better journey was about that. that goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, yet they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon, become a runner. We've talked about these. Yet more foundationally is this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on, that we should measure at the end of the day, and attend to our sources of meaning at the start, that the story of self and the story of the world can/must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to be able to see/echo/resonate with and inspire knowledge and action, that togetherness matters, that being a mirror matters, that finding emotions is precious, that discernment between emotions and state matters, that goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice, that we can go slow, that we can be gentle with ourselves, that we are successful once we start on the path to self knowledge and alignment with values perception and enaction. I think sometimes you must think that I'm crazy, and perhaps I am. Although I'm working on developing my ideas, gathering stories (micro finance was beautiful, right? Amu Yunus got a nobel prise, cool? well, we're seeing the fruits of not foundationally changing the perception of what finance is, what money is, what it serves, what a human is with a spate of suicides as a result of not being able to pay the petty sum back and being hounded by people who are achieving \"targets\" - targets, pretty grim. https://www.theafricareport.com/329702/microfinance-suicides-show-africans-must-beware-of-excessive-debt/\n\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no it's not only because we don't have money to have paid holidays, there's something burney about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions, we must treat people as ends - and get close. Relationships matter, commtiment matters, connection matters, scale can happen, in a beautiful and authentic way, and probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again. I sometimes think perhaps I've been saved from success, because I'm not sure I would have had the time, perspective, and frustration quite frankly to see as I do. Am I just \"sour grapesing\" this whole thing? I don't think so, I think indigenous economics talking about cyclical time (not linear) thinking 7 generations (not retire when I'm 40), relationships with a world of meaning (not humans and nature as resources to extract) - are similar, yet indigenous economics stays small and sort of implies we must take their principles and ways of doing things rather than discovering them ourselves in our own indegenatiy - our Lebanese indigenous economics... emerging from systems built by people who have re-integrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic, and the eyes of meaning and quality. And beingconfident enough to know we need to be wary of too much planning in an era of collapse, we need to live in a way that when the bombs drop, or the seas start rising, we are confident we did what we were made to do, and were successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not. I hope this short essay made some sense, I wanted to share this to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic. I think this is what I want to do next for work, to operationalize this process of first recognizing the perceptual faculty that we're being gas-lit not to identify (that artists usually are pretty clear about, good ones at least), that that faculty can see things and know things that are both //realiable// and //true// - that just as reason can see and we can deduce truth, we can do that with quality as well, that this faculty can help us identify our sources of meaning, the things that matter to us, that by finding that and living them more in our lives we come alive, and that coming alive brings energy and goodness, and that through this process we build capacity, skills, relationships, knowledge stories of self, stories of world to dynamically move through the world without artifice. That we all need to awaken the artist within us to help us weave a more beautiful story, that is just as true, and perhaps more true. To undo the fragility of systems and unearth the beauty and humility of emergence. I don't think I intend to \"get by\" anymore with my work, I have to share what I know or I shrivel up and help no one. I remember being asked in 2016 to make an entrepreneurship program and I thought it was silly to have everyone do the same assignments, I thought it would be cool to direct people to the things they needed with technology and today I'm going back again and having another one of those moments where I can't do the same thing anymore. I need to do something different, beautiful, and I'd love to do it with you - if you're in with me :)"

Let me pull out and engage with some of the key threads I see running through your essay:\n\n1. The tension between systemization and emergence\nYou're wrestling with how our drive to create scalable systems often conflicts with the organic, emergent nature of meaningful change. You use the metaphor of \"the master's tools\" which is particularly apt - suggesting that using purely systematic, metrics-driven approaches to create social change may reproduce the very patterns we're trying to transform.\n\nA lens that might be helpful here is thinking about gardens versus machines. A gardener creates conditions for growth but can't directly control how things emerge. They work with natural processes rather than trying to engineer predetermined outcomes.\n\n2. The critique of instrumental rationality \nYou're pointing out how treating people (including ourselves) as means to an end - even noble ends like SDGs - can be deeply problematic. This reminds me of Martin Buber's distinction between I-It and I-Thou relationships. When we relate to people instrumentally (I-It), we miss the essence of human connection and meaning-making.\n\n3. The question of scale and depth\nYou propose an interesting reframe - what if instead of focusing on breadth of impact, we focused on depth? This connects to your point about transmission of values happening through lived experience rather than through systems and forms.\n\nLet me challenge one aspect though - you seem to sometimes set up a stark dichotomy between systematic/rational approaches and meaning/quality-based approaches. Could there be a both/and here? Just as we need both eyes to see depth, perhaps we need both rational systems and quality-based discernment to create lasting positive change.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring what a concrete example of this integrated approach might look like? For instance, how might Bloom's mentorship program be redesigned to honor both the systematic and emergent aspects of development?",

            "extracted_content": "Dear David and Dara,\nWe need both eyes to see depth. I think we’ve been working with one eye shut and I’d like to open the second eye, the eye of insight, quality, beauty, love, truth. The eye that knows what’s good. We need good people and trust that they will do beautiful things—not good systems that we attempt to shape people through.\nThe suspicions I've been having about \"winners take all\" and that we can't take down the master's house with the master's tools are becoming clearer and clearer to me. I want to ensure that our work honors the non-instrumental nature of treating people as ends, not means to SDGs or impact, or stories to tell our donors. It's by doing the right things for the right reasons that we can be successful as human beings first, facing ourselves in the mirror. Honor and dignity are worth more than continued funding from donors who don't trust us to treat us well.\nEven the idea that we can create systems of digital tools that scale and create an impact that is \"out of our hands\" is somehow missing something important. Our care and our connection are essential. We need to ensure that we are crafting something meaningful and beautiful—a system that honors the maker and the person using it, preserving their insight. There's something about relationship that we've been alienated from. We text instead of calling, we want to \"blast\" an email to thousands, and have systems with drop-offs at every stage versus the connection and knowledge that grows from our spheres and through them to their spheres.\nThrough our connection with mentors, we can transmit these new ways of seeing and lived values—not as a list, but as a lived experience. This is how we can trust that they get it. We will know because we will see and feel it in our interactions with them. The idea that we can give a feedback form or an assessment and get answers from our mentors is only half right. They will only be able to share what they see with the eye of rationality. We need to see them with the eye of quality—the eye of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty—the eye that knows these things.\nThen, we can have scalable systems where those people can impact others, rather than thinking about scale in breadth—showing how many people have jobs or planted trees. We need to get more comfortable with depth: how many people are having meaningful moments, finding their gifts, and sharing them in gratitude, making a more sincere, honest, and beautiful change versus one which has \"good impact.\" Impact—the sound of a heavy book hitting the floor or an asteroid on the earth—reminds me of \"fail fast and break things\" and disruptive technologies. We don't need to be disruptive in these days; things are disruptive enough. We need to be a source of healing.\nDeveloping skills and knowledge at the edge of our growth in the face of challenges means we need to be sincere about what we know and what we don't know, what we can do and what we can't. I believe that rushing into things because there is funding is a horrible reason to do something. What if we can get funding so people can know themselves, the world, and access what their hearts are calling them towards? What if funding allowed us to go deeper, work with fewer, and support them as they worked it out, rather than pushing funding, expenditures, and movement that may be adding friction and doing a bunch of wrong things that'll need to be undone? With so much friction, we can certainly burn people out, as we've seen on our own teams. What are we really doing?\nWhy do we talk about wellbeing and stress? What if we aligned ourselves more humbly, took on projects that gave us deep connection, and built real community by helping everyone slow down enough to have community? We can move fast later when fast is what wants to happen. I know this sounds idealistic, and I know you worry about the business failing, and that's okay. I sort of think that business might need to go.\nI don't know if you believe, as I do, that good things live and true things find their homes. If we don't focus on what we \"can do to keep going\" and truly focus on what is the problem that moves us and what brings us to life sincerely, if we are \"eating our own dogfood,\" I think we'll find something. It might be small—who knows, maybe a team of two or three for a while—although I don't think that's so bad.\nWhat if we found ways to help Bloom be a business we \"want to do\" rather than \"have to do\"? Perhaps we need to find other jobs to give us time to build the real thing we want to share with the world. Maybe we need time to reflect and can work like Einstein did at some desk job somewhere so we can think. Maybe our children happening, our contracts dwindling, isn't the time to rush. Maybe these are signs (if you believe in those things—perhaps you'd prefer signals) that we should slow down and think deeper. It's what I've been doing.\nI've been thinking about our time in Turkey and the idea of coming alive that was starting to come into resolution for me there. The ideas that there was something weird about helping people have goals for social change and getting them to take on the \"habits and best practices to help them be most effective\"—it's possible that I'm wrong, yet I think it's clearer than ever to me that this is not something I'm willing to subjugate. Initially, I thought I could draw on the \"depth\" of things, and the systems would help scale out to the \"breadths\" of things—that wellbeing and welldoing were possible to bring together in a harmonious balance.\nExternally, that may be what people see when they witness someone like my friend Dug Song build businesses while being a family man, not leaving Detroit for Silicon Valley, and still skateboarding while building a business that sells for 2.x billion dollars. I think that this is not an accident and that it was not a set of systems that he took on or books he read. The idea of \"habits of success\" is so instrumental to me. If you think about it, you will use your will to compel your mind and body into specific patterns of behavior to achieve a goal. Your mind and body have become instruments for this goal. Is the goal worth it? Why do you think there's burnout, alienation, and why do you think even in the social sector there are bad actors who believe that the ends justify the means?\nIt's taken me a long time to accept the lessons I was given when I was younger, inspired by Father Greg Boyle. When they asked his intentions for doing his social enterprise, he didn't give some SDG that needed to be addressed or some \"God told me to do it\" nonsense. He said because they were his friends. Relationality, closeness, love, connection, and care—these are all ends, reasons to do things that no one should have to justify and might be impossible to justify because they are not perceived by the eye of rationality. They are perceived by the eye that knows what goodness is, what truth is, and what beauty is. That eye is the one that I would like to cultivate.\nThe Nietzsche quote, \"He who has a strong enough why can overcome any how,\" guides me here. People who love have climbed mountains—\"there ain't no mountain high enough,\" \"there ain't no ocean vast enough\"—to keep them away from the beauty they want to do. This is a real reason, a source of persistence, vitality, and passion to knock on a thousand doors until one opens. This is why they'll leave our heart-based aliveness-focused program and join Y Combinator to get what they need financially or figure something totally new and unexpected out.\nI'm finally able to see why I care so much about community, the upside-down pyramid, starting with why, character strengths, and coming alive. It's not about some materialist interpretation of mindfulness-based stress reduction for people to better manage their emotions to do the nonsense they have committed to doing. It's about coming to view emotions as messengers, to look through them into the place they touch your heart. Why do we feel sad when we see animals going extinct? What about that is meaningful for us that's being lost? Think about it, feel into it, see what echoes within you. Those emotions are treasures, and we are constantly being played by a masterful orchestra.\nEach tense emotion tells us something about a blocked source of meaning. Each positive emotion is a gift to enjoy, persist, and sink into what we're doing without being attached. Contentedness is not an emotion; it's a state. I believe these states are profoundly important to the idea of why we should be doing things and can be found when we tap into our sources of meaning, come alive, and heed their calls with small, bold actions. Similar to the zone described by the flow state, where our skills are at the edge of our capacity and the challenge we're at, we can gradually find the next emerging way of being by responding to the constant flow of calls.\nThis means trust, implies process, and moves people, businesses, projects, and more from a system of semi-static parts to an alive, organic whole that cannot be segmented, assessed with forms, analyzed, projected into the future, and planned. It's the reality that it's hubris to think otherwise. It's part of the insanity about why the iNGOs are more than happy to give us jobs, yet are silent when it comes to keeping us alive (Palestinians and Lebanese). We saw how let down the people who can see this hypocrisy felt. It's so true though—the goals, the SDGs, the plans—these things are dead on arrival. The reality of being responsive, being real, being caring, being human and humane is lost to the organizations focused on the attainment of something.\nI know this all probably sounds crazy. In fact, I'm confident that since you've known me long enough, you might accept it a bit more. Yet for me, it took a while to finally deconstruct a few things, starting with Aristotle and the idea of classification. Aristotle’s metaphysics focus on cause-and-effect relationships (final cause, material cause) percolate like water through the grounds of Western culture and get amplified by the mechanistic thinking of the Scientific Revolution (Descartes, Newton). It's just a brain watching a world of parts interact—sort of system thinking, Hobbes. Oh crap, Christians are killing each other; we're totally horrible, and we need a rational government to put things in order. Systems should be what we follow, not people. Enlightenment off with his headism, individualist pieces that can reason best for themselves, laden with democratic American ideas like \"let's pick happiness as a teleological conclusion,\" etc.\nWe live in a soulless world of rational objects, bodies needing food, cause-effect transactions in a swirl of beautiful elegance making a souffle out of anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, and the mathematics that Galileo said is the perfect way to describe the world. It can all be displayed as a nice little infographic—the world is made of markets transacting materiality. The hard problem of consciousness is irrelevant when we have people dying of malaria, and we go fix that because death is bad. What about not living at all, not coming alive, becoming a machine, giving up your ability to sense meaning and connect to true purpose for some fear-based worry your philosophical forefathers (that most have no idea about or understand the impact of the history of ideas) had?\nWe're here because of someone else's war, freaking people out. Our systems destroy the planet due to seeing humans as human resources for a machine that's efficiently transforming materiality into material to satisfy the needs and desires of humans. If there aren't enough desires to create enough demand to necessitate the improvement of the systems and optimization to achieve goals more efficiently, because hey, what rational person wouldn't want cheaper tomatoes? Who cares if we breed them to be transported across the ocean and have no idea what that does to the flavor, let alone nutritional profile? We must use these fear-based epistemologies and ontologies that see the world full of nasty, brutish people who will die shortly unless we use our reason to align with the reason of the natural world, to break it up into little pieces and use it to our favor. And BTW, the people who think like this are more likely to be skiing in the Alps and owning businesses than running them. Also, their kids don't go to public schools and get graded like screws and meat of varying quality. By the way, I'm more of a B/B+ sort of person than a Grade A, so here, doing this thinking is a bit out of my weight class. Yet I digress, and I try anyway to help you see, feel, and understand this foundational thing.\nIt's NOT about the wrong goals, profit or SDGs. It's not even about the systems leveraging personal and professional growth to help transform the economic system into one that's better for people and the planet. No, it's about the way of seeing and understanding what a person is, what the world is, and the systems that emerge from that understanding.\nOur neoliberal order is sort of a beautiful system that is hard to argue with. Market efficiency sort of works, as does reductionist science as we break atoms further down into their core. We can understand the material and superficial world and can move things, energy, resources, and food—all commodities—which the markets manage, valuing perfectly well. The problem is there is no reason for this elegant dance of a billion buy-sell decisions mostly run by machines. There is only short-sighted efficiency of materiality.\nI've tried not to say God in this run-on paragraph. Yet it's a bit hard not to, so how about you look at your favorite person, a loved one, and convince yourself they are a \"user\" of Instagram, a customer of Zara, or a citizen of a country—little pinballs bouncing around in the systems of goals and accomplishments of others. What about your feeling of love? That's some oxytocin and some serotonin floating around a bloodstream in a body that wants to keep its bodily integrity intact so that it can propagate itself and not die. You cannot learn Darwin's theory and believe it without hurting your soul a little bit. There are people who die for beauty—don't you know? There are things that matter more than life itself. You know this; you may have even felt this if you're lucky. Yet we have no way in our modern mindset to understand it, where we can place it, what power this is that is ultimately lost.\nThese things have been bugging me for a long time. I started in education, realizing the issue with the control systems being forced on children—full of aliveness and dreams, shaping them into consumers and workers. I saw the post-WWII economic system require us to win the war of ideas and ensure that capitalism produces power and material success, and we did it at our own expense. Sure, this is all fine, said typing on a MacBook Pro made by a capitalist company with $216 billion in cash reserves, benefiting from the international trade that brings me coffee from Ethiopia to my door and markets that pressure countries to fight on my behalf so everything is affordable and safe.\nYet I think it doesn't have to be revolutionary. I think the simple act of finding that part of us that can see and feel what beauty and goodness are and asking it what it needs to shine and doing that—a little each day. Weirdly enough, for me, it's writing you this long letter. I was going to use AI to help clean it up and summarize and make it all polished, yet somehow I think that goes against my point here. We need to see each other, even our messy selves. This is from my heart to yours. I'm writing this with you, Dara, and you, Munir, in mind.\nIt's been a long struggle for me, starting before 2022 in Turkey—where I've felt off, yet I acquiesced, allowing my doubt in my own feelings to fester. I thought maybe he's right. Maybe we can keep doing/building this way. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a productive tension. I mentioned these ideas of coming alive in the retreat, although I think I didn't realize at the time that that's the foundational thing I want to do—the upside-down pyramid, self-efficacy, character strengths, notes journal, breakout rooms, one-on-ones, the 1% better journey were about that. Goals can come not from a dream of a desired future state, but they can emerge from becoming the kind of person who achieves that goal. Don't plan to run a marathon; become a runner. We've talked about these.\nYet more foundationally, this clarity shows me the kinds of things to focus on: we should measure at the end of the day and attend to our sources of meaning at the start. The story of self and the story of the world can and must be discovered and grown so we can allow our qualitative witnessing to see, echo, resonate with, and inspire knowledge and action. Togetherness matters, being a mirror matters, finding emotions is precious, discerning between emotions and states matters, goals can be had, yet ways of being we admire are what we must engender and practice. We can go slow, be gentle with ourselves, and be successful once we start on the path to self-knowledge and alignment with values, perception, and enaction.\nI think sometimes you must think that I'm crazy, and perhaps I am. Although I'm working on developing my ideas, gathering stories (microfinance was beautiful, right? Amu Yunus got a Nobel Prize, cool? Well, we're seeing the fruits of not foundationally changing the perception of what finance is, what money is, what it serves. What a human is with a spate of suicides as a result of not being able to pay the petty sum back and being hounded by people who are achieving \"targets\"—targets, pretty grim).\nI'm working on developing this into a clearer vision of what I think my work in \"social impact\" can be, what I think the problems are of burnout and lack of wellbeing. And no, it's not only because we don't have money for paid holidays; there's something burning about using yourself for something that is not yourself. We can cultivate gardens of conditions—we must treat people as ends and get close. Relationships matter, commitment matters, connection matters. Scale can happen in a beautiful and authentic way, probably not in the way we plan, where we draw hockey stick charts and hope and hope again.\nI sometimes think perhaps I've been saved from success because I'm not sure I would have had the time, perspective, and frustration, quite frankly, to see as I do. Am I just \"sourgraping\" this whole thing? I don't think so. I think indigenous economics—talking about cyclical time (not linear) thinking, seven generations (not retiring when I'm 40), relationships with a world of meaning (not humans and nature as resources to extract)—are similar. Yet indigenous economics stays small and sort of implies we must take their principles and ways of doing things rather than discovering them ourselves in our own indigeneity—our Lebanese indigenous economics—emerging from systems built by people who have reintegrated both eyes, seeing with reason and logic and the eyes of meaning and quality. Being confident enough to know we need to be wary of too much planning in an era of collapse. We need to live in a way that when the bombs drop or the seas start rising, we are confident we did what we were made to do and were successful at every step of the way, no matter if we arrived wherever we thought we might or not.\nI hope this short essay made some sense. I wanted to share this to see if you have feedback, what gaps were in my logic. I think this is what I want to do next for work: to operationalize this process of first recognizing the perceptual faculty that we're being gaslit not to identify (artists usually are pretty clear about this, good ones at least). That faculty can see things and know things that are both reliable and true—just as reason can see and we can deduce truth, we can do that with quality as well. This faculty can help us identify our sources of meaning, the things that matter to us. By finding that and living them more in our lives, we come alive. Coming alive brings energy and goodness, and through this process, we build capacity, skills, relationships, knowledge, stories of self, and stories of the world to dynamically move through the world without artifice.\nWe all need to awaken the artist within us to help us weave a more beautiful story that is just as true, and perhaps more true, to undo the fragility of systems and unearth the beauty and humility of emergence. I don't think I intend to \"get by\" anymore with my work. I have to share what I know, or I shrivel up and help no one. I remember being asked in 2016 to make an entrepreneurship program, and I thought it was silly to have everyone do the same assignments. I thought it would be cool to direct people to the things they needed with technology. Today, I'm going back again and having another one of those moments where I can't do the same thing anymore. I need to do something different, beautiful, and I'd love to do it with you—if you're in with me :)\nWarm regards,\n\n"

The Instrumental vs. Intrinsic Value Tension\nYou make a compelling case about how our current systems often reduce people to instruments for achieving goals (even noble ones like SDGs). Your metaphor about \"using your will to compel your mind and body into specific patterns\" to achieve goals really lands - it captures how even self-improvement can become a form of self-instrumentalization.\n\nHowever, here's a challenge to consider: Might there be a way to hold both instrumental and intrinsic value simultaneously? For instance, when a parent cooks for their child, it's both instrumental (the child needs food) and an act of love. The key seems to be whether the instrumental aspect serves the intrinsic one, rather than replacing it.\n\n2. The Scale vs. Depth Question\nYou suggest that true scale might come through depth rather than breadth - through the authentic transmission of lived values rather than through systems and metrics. Your gardening metaphor (cultivating conditions) is apt.\n\nBut let me push back: Isn't there something democratizing about systems? While personal mentorship is beautiful, it's also inherently limited. Might thoughtfully designed systems help extend the reach of that human touch rather than replace it?\n\n3. The Integration of Two Ways of Seeing\nYour core argument about needing both eyes - the eye of rationality and the eye of quality/meaning - is profound. But I wonder if you're sometimes setting up a false dichotomy. When scientists speak of the \"elegance\" of a theory, aren't they using both eyes? When artists master their technical craft to serve beauty, aren't they integrating both?\n\n4. The Question of Implementation\nHere's the challenging question: How might Bloom operationalize this vision? Some concrete thoughts:\n- What if your technology focused on enabling deeper human connections rather than replacing them?\n- Could your metrics capture depth of transformation alongside breadth?\n- How might you design programs that honor both systematic skill-building and emergent meaning-making?\n\nI especially appreciate your point about indigenous economics and cyclical time. Rather than just adopting indigenous principles, you suggest discovering our own way of seeing with both eyes - that feels key.\n\nYou ask about gaps in your logic. The main one I see isn't so much a gap as a need for integration: How do we honor both systematic and emergent ways of knowing without falling into dualism? The answer might lie in your own metaphor of depth perception requiring both eyes working together.\n\nYou're not crazy. You're wrestling with fundamental questions about meaning, scale, and social change. The challenge now is finding practical ways to embody these insights while staying viable as an organization.
