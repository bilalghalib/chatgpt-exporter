Today, I'd like to chat with you about the difference between being in the zone, and the difference between getting into this super hyper-focused state that I can get into sometimes, that I used to think was called the zone, but I hear that being in the zone is actually rejuvenating and valuable, and sometimes when I pull myself out of these rabbit holes, I look back and I'm like, man, where did all that time go? Making incremental progress is a key trait. So, for instance, coding, just another tweak, just another time, solve this bug. And instead, if I just leave and think about it or take a shower, sometimes the solution is like, oh yeah, that's what you should do. But I don't give myself that time to just sit and think in ways like thinking too hard. I definitely have ADD, and I'm wondering how I can think about this. So, what are the blind spots that I'm not aware of that you can see in this conversation? What do psychiatrists or psychologists say?

So instead of just jumping straight in, can we think a little bit about this difference? I really appreciated that difference between a flow state that gets somebody into alignment with, I guess you could say it's their will and what they were made to do, like all of their skills and all the things that are coming together at just the right time and just the right place for them to be at the edge of their capacity, feeling like they're doing something towards a goal that matters to them, that's meaningful, and having the resources, but just not quite yet all the resources to do it. And that sounds beautiful. That reminds me a lot of some of these mystical perspectives, and I can definitely see a connection there with kind of listening to all of the signs in the universe, both inward and outward, giving you sort of guidance as to what you should be doing right now, right? And how life can really be a flow if we also develop the skills that we need at different stages and, you know, wherever you are, you have the right skills, I guess, to find that growth edge. And so maybe for me, I need to be a little bit more humble and think about, like, what are my actual skills? Like, what did I really develop? And what are not my skills, and what's my growth edge? So I guess one of the weird things right now is, like, I never really thought of this as a skill, but, like, mind mapping and coherence of complicated topics and coming up with frameworks and, like, framework design, like, that's a skill, right? And so I'm struggling with that, and I think I have the intuition, I have some skill, and I spent some time yesterday mapping things out, and I did it in a co-working session with people where we had 45 minutes to work, and then a short break, and then coming back, and I kind of really liked that. So I think I'm going to give that a shot again. I think I've picked skills that I thought were important, like, for external reasons, like, coding is really highly praised, and other skills, I mean, like, I really want to think about it. Workshop facilitation is my skill, and it's very rejuvenating, and it definitely uses all of my capacity, and I think that there's a, if I, yeah, and definitely if I took it a little bit more seriously, I could find my growth edge, and someone just invited me to give a workshop to a group of women in Iraq, actually, at the end of this month, and initially, I was going to say no, because I don't really want to go all the way to Iraq and back for a two-day workshop, but if it pays well, and if it's something that I think could be a way that I can really explore this idea of my growth edge, and flow, and taking it seriously, and so it's like a two-day, six-hour workshop.

Let\\'s start with a theoretical framework for dopamine and reward molecules.\\n\\n### Dopamine & Reward Molecules\\n- **Dopamine**: Often known as the \"anticipation\" molecule, dopamine is released in response to cues that predict rewards. It motivates us to take action toward a goal and is crucial in driving focus and effort.\\n\\n- **Other Reward Molecules**: These include endorphins, serotonin, and oxytocin, which are released when we achieve goals, feel connected, or experience pleasure. They create feelings of well-being and satisfaction.\\n\\n### When Are They Released?\\n- **Dopamine** is released when you anticipate a reward, are curious, or face a novel challenge.\\n- **Endorphins** are released during physical activity, excitement, or laughter.\\n- **Serotonin** is released when you feel important or valued.\\n- **Oxytocin** is released during social bonding and trust-building activities.\\n\\n### Transforming Hyper-Focus into Flow\\n- **Identify Triggers**: Recognize what activities naturally release dopamine for you.\\n- **Align Challenges**: Ensure tasks are aligned with your skills but still offer growth edges.\\n- **Incorporate Rewards**: Find ways to incorporate those reward molecules, like celebrating small wins or connecting with others.\\n\\n### Defining Skills\\nSkills can be viewed as abilities you can develop and refine. They\\'re not just natural talents but areas where you can grow through practice and feedback. Your abilities like structuring ideas, storytelling, and public speaking are indeed skills—skills that can be honed with intentional effort.\\n\\n### Mapping This Out\\nCreating a table or diagram can help visualize these concepts. It might look something like this:\\n\\n| **Molecule**   | **Trigger**                     | **Reward**                          |\\n|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\\n| Dopamine     | Anticipation, Novelty, Curiosity | Motivation to pursue goals        |\\n| Endorphins    | Physical activity, Excitement | Pleasure, Pain relief            |\\n| Serotonin    | Feeling important, Valued     | Well-being, Happiness              |\\n| Oxytocin     | Social bonding, Trust         | Connection, Emotional bonding       |\\n\\n### Next Steps\\nYou can start by recognizing these skills and intentionally practicing them. Try small experiments to break hyper-focus and introduce a sense of novelty. By reframing your perspective on skills and rewards, you can create a more structured pathway for growth and flow.\\n\\nDoes this resonate with you?', 'direction': 'out', 'decoding_id': None}\n{'expiry_datetime': '2025-02-15T08:27:12.224362+00:00', 'content_type': 'audio_asset_pointer', 'asset_pointer': 'sediment://file_254d30335608303c33c5fdeb572c2603395159a8cb10a5b7ba7dcc96e8dcc9b1df462079404e2aa8e6e8de6740b5d9d4', 'size_bytes': 5954478, 'format': 'wav', 'metadata': {'start_timestamp': None, 'end_timestamp': None, 'pretokenized_vq': None, 'interruptions': None, 'original_audio_source': None, 'transcription': None, 'word_transcription': None, 'start': 0, 'end': 124.05}}",

      "content": "Yeah, so I'm really interested in connecting these reward molecules and the idea of like presence and attention and abiding and how they relate. So dopamine can like initiate attention, but like what can sustain it? And then what's the difference between that attention and presence? And I'm wondering if there's a relationship between presence and sort of these molecules that help you become, right? It's like a carrot at the end of the stick. You have to do something long and hard and arduous. And then when you arrive, you get this short moment of abiding in like, hell yeah, we did it. But now on to the next one. And that's the problem with goals. And I'm wondering about this idea of like abiding in God and this like presence and this idea of like enlightenment being something that is a permanent state that you can achieve where there's like a lack of suffering. But a lot of people say that like growth is at the end, at the edge of these moments of suffering and that a lot of this molecular chemicals of reward seems to be related to stuff that might be at the end of a desire and like desires lead to suffering in the Buddhist model. And so if you think about it, like this desire to get fit and then you like exert yourself when you feel the struggle and it burns and it hurts and someone's yelling at you and you have a coach. And at some point, like you end the workout and you lay back and you look at what you've done. You're like, hell yeah, I did it. And then you are rewarded. And like this reward, is it something that has to be temporary? Or is it something that can be more permanent? For instance, I think people that wind up having these addictive behaviors are seeking that experience without the exertion. And it sort of like tricks the system and then you actually like over consume and you get these states more often than you're supposed to. And maybe you get like the wrong impression of what a good life is. And like how does all of this relate to a good life, right? And I feel like this becoming is an important element that's also related to what we were talking about with the flow states. Because a flow state, you're like at the edge. You have like the minimum viable suffering needed. That growth edge that is still an edge, but you're like just on one side or the other of it. And you can still be proud of yourself, but you're not like totally suffering and totally lost. And not only that, like you have the skills. And because it's at the edge, you're developing that new skill and it's emerging from the unseen into the seen. The thing that you could be coming into who you are. And then that feeling of becoming could be like, wow, like a witnessing of the divine potential that is being manifest through you. And I think that's like a really interesting way of thinking about all these things. But I'm wondering how it connects to witnessing and presence. Is that like the giving birth of the divine and then you just have a few seconds of witnessing? And what is it like to be in presence constantly? How do all these things relate? And does this make sense? And could you help me like see the relationships and make a map?",

      "content": "Yes, this makes profound sense, and it’s a deeply rich web of ideas. Let’s unpack and map these layers of connection between **reward molecules, presence, attention, suffering, flow, becoming, and abiding**—and see how they might relate to living a good life.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Dopamine: The Spark of Attention and Drive**\n- **Role:** Dopamine motivates action by creating anticipation of a reward. It initiates focus and drives us toward goals.\n- **Limits:** Dopamine is transient. It pulls you into action but doesn’t sustain satisfaction—it’s the \"carrot\" that keeps moving once you’ve reached a goal.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What Sustains Attention?**\n- Sustained attention often depends on **serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins**:\n  - **Serotonin**: Provides a sense of peace, gratitude, and contentment. This might be connected to “abiding” moments—being present with what is.\n  - **Oxytocin**: Social bonding, connection, and trust. Being in presence with others can sustain focus and emotional well-being.\n  - **Endorphins**: Relief and pleasure in moments of exertion. These might bridge suffering and joy.\n  \nThese molecules interact to create a more holistic sense of being that sustains attention beyond dopamine’s fleeting drive.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Presence vs. Attention**\n- **Attention**: A focused narrowing, often goal-directed and dopamine-driven. It’s about engaging with what needs to be done.\n- **Presence**: A broader, deeper state of being. It transcends the pursuit of goals, involving awareness of the moment without needing to move toward something. Presence may align more with serotonin and oxytocin—creating spaciousness and connection rather than striving.\n\n---\n\n### **4. The Growth Edge: Suffering and Flow**\n- Flow happens **at the edge of challenge and skill**—the “minimum viable suffering” required for growth. It’s not total struggle or ease; it’s the **just right zone** where becoming is most visible.\n- In flow, you are both **becoming and being**. There’s an interplay between pushing into new skills (suffering, effort) and the satisfaction of feeling capable (presence, joy).\n  \n**Key Insight**: Flow might be the middle ground where dopamine-driven action and serotonin-driven presence coexist.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Reward, Suffering, and the Good Life**\n- **Temporary Reward**: Achievements give short bursts of joy (dopamine), but they fade. Over-chasing these rewards, as in addictive behaviors, creates dissatisfaction because it bypasses the process of becoming.\n- **Permanent Reward**: Presence offers a “permanent reward”—the state of **being with what is**, beyond striving. This aligns with Buddhist notions of detachment from desire and abiding in the now.\n  \nA **good life** might balance:\n  - **Dopamine**: Pursuing meaningful goals.\n  - **Serotonin and Presence**: Abiding in gratitude and contentment.\n  - **Suffering**: Leaning into challenges that foster growth without overwhelming.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Witnessing, Presence, and Becoming**\n- **Witnessing the Divine**: The act of becoming—bringing unseen potential into reality—can feel like a co-creative act with the divine. Presence in these moments is like witnessing your highest self emerge.\n- **Presence Constantly**: This might mean shifting from *goal-driven doing* to *grateful being*—abiding in God, where growth happens without clinging to outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Map of Relationships**\n#### The Good Life: A Dynamic Flow Between Elements\n\n| **Element**           | **State**                     | **Molecules**          | **Experience**                   |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Dopamine**           | Goal-driven action            | Dopamine               | Anticipation, motivation         |\n| **Serotonin**          | Contentment, presence         | Serotonin              | Peace, gratitude                 |\n| **Oxytocin**           | Connection and trust          | Oxytocin               | Bonding, love, safety            |\n| **Endorphins**         | Relief through effort         | Endorphins             | Joy in exertion                  |\n| **Flow**               | Balance of challenge and skill| Dopamine + Serotonin   | Growth and becoming              |\n| **Presence**           | Abiding in the moment         | Serotonin + Oxytocin   | Awareness, fulfillment           |\n| **Witnessing the Divine** | Realizing potential       | All of the above       | Awe, reverence, connection       |\n\n---\n\n### **7. Practices to Cultivate Balance**\nTo live a life of abiding presence and growth, consider:\n1. **Engaging Flow**: Seek challenges at your growth edge. Create space for curiosity and skill development.\n2. **Practicing Gratitude**: Daily reflection on what’s already fulfilling (serotonin).\n3. **Building Connection**: Foster relationships that promote trust and support (oxytocin).\n4. **Embracing Suffering Mindfully**: Reframe effort as part of growth, leaning into “minimum viable suffering.”\n5. **Developing Presence**: Meditative practices that emphasize “being” rather than “doing.”\n\n---\n\n### **Reflection Questions**\n1. How can you balance the pull of dopamine-driven goals with the grounding of serotonin-based presence?\n2. What are moments where you’ve experienced flow? How might you invite more of those into your life?\n3. How can your vision of becoming align with abiding in God, not just for fleeting moments, but as a practice of presence?\n\nDoes this help clarify the relationships and give you a framework for further exploration? I’d love to refine or expand this with you!",

      "content": "If fear narrows our range of vision figuratively and literally - does life expand it? How does all this relate to Joe Edelman and Charles Taylor’s ideas about values and attentional policies. When a meaningful moment arises what is being attended to - these things comprise the meaningful moment. Because if not what else could it be, why would we ignore a meaningful aspect - for instance we might have an attentional policy in a good conversation to attend to OPENINGS where we can engage with the ideas of other people to engage them into the conversation \n\nThese ways of actively looking in a meaningful moment can be called constitutive attentional polices, things we do for themselves without an objective - we do it because these are ways of being that we love to uphold, cherish, honor.\n\nDoes dopamine have a role in moments of meaning defined like this? Can you make a table describing all the concepts and molecule and see how they interact in a moment of meaning like this? \n\nThink through the consequences and other ways to think of meaningful moments and how our attention and presence are activated in them and how there may be a lack of goals or a goal to attend to these things? It seems that attentional policies are policies we can learn by being with people and being inspired and we have large whites of our eyes to see what other people attend to - we talk about the satisfaction of a job well done. An archer throwing an arrow with no goal (zen) and getting a bulls eye. \n\nWhat attentional policies show up when we’re in the zone? When we lose ourselves to dance?\n\nHow can we “choose” a policy. Or done just remind ourselves if we forget when we’re out of presence and when we’re in presence we’ve entered with intentionality - the policies that we tell ourselves that this is how to be who we want to be, because being a good listener is beautiful, it’s a good thing to cherish uphold and honor - not so they return the favor to listen, that would become an instrument. The thing we’re seeing is a behavior here - attending to moments when we can create gaps of silence to allow the quieter people to share is a beautiful way to be a good listener and it can compete with moments when we want to have the attentional policy to have COMPANIONS who say yes and moving the conversation forward in a musical and fluid pattern - and that tension requires a wisdom to realize which way, or which new third way is better, we can use:\nRole models who behave in these contexts and situations that inspire us(what are we feeling here, a draw, a hope, what are the reward molecules here? What else might be going on)\nStories from our own history which we acted in a way that inspired us and upheld our values (our memory reminders of ways of being that are meaningful, and a third option is creatively grappling with the situation, opening up to revelation insight and inspiration, creating a new way. For instance for me that fluid conversations and the incorporating all types of people into our Converation needs me to really understand the things I attend to when I bring in the quiet people, I love doing that because it feels like opening up to their gifts - giving respect to the beautiful invisible parts of a community - to add diversity, so for me perhaps a third way to hold both is to attune to a slower rhythm and appreciate a slower BMP, finding the rhythm in the slower conversation making space for people and enjoying the flow. \n\nIt looks like the “opening” to the muses and realizing that inspiration directed towards meaning can be a source of becoming that might be a growth edge. Slowing down like that might be hard, the people who inspire us might be “out of our league for now… \n\nCan you organize my thoughts here and cluster the concepts the hormones the open questions and see if there’s a clear and coherent way to tell this story?\n",

      "content": "Your thoughts weave together many rich and interconnected ideas about attention, presence, values, and meaning. Below is an organized framework to help clarify these concepts, clustering your ideas, identifying key hormones/molecules, and offering a way to tell this story coherently.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Key Concepts**\n#### **A. Meaningful Moments**\n- **Definition**: Moments where attentional policies align with values, allowing presence to emerge and meaning to be felt.\n- **Constitutive attentional policies**: Ways of being we cherish for their own sake (e.g., being a good listener, making space for quiet voices).\n- **Tension in attentional policies**: Competing priorities, such as fostering fluid conversations vs. creating space for slower rhythms, require wisdom to navigate.\n\n#### **B. Attention and Presence**\n- **Attention**: Focused on aspects of the moment that resonate with values (e.g., gaps in conversation, openings for connection).\n- **Presence**: The state of being fully engaged in the moment, often involving intentionality and alignment with cherished ways of being.\n- **Activation**: Meaningful attention often arises from attentional policies learned from role models, personal stories, or moments of creative grappling.\n\n#### **C. Growth and Becoming**\n- **Flow States**: The zone where attentional policies become fluid and intuitive, balancing engagement with personal and collective rhythm.\n- **Growth Edge**: Slowing down or adapting attentional policies to integrate new ways of being, inspired by muses or role models.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Role of Reward Molecules**\n| **Molecule**      | **Role in Meaningful Moments**                                                                                  |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Dopamine**       | Anticipates and drives engagement. Creates the \"pull\" to notice and act on meaningful openings.                |\n| **Serotonin**      | Provides contentment and alignment. Grounds the sense of abiding in values and meaningful presence.             |\n| **Oxytocin**       | Fosters connection and trust. Deepens the relational aspect of attentional policies, especially in conversations.|\n| **Endorphins**     | Offers joy in effort. Supports the satisfaction of aligning actions with cherished values.                      |\n\n---\n\n### **3. Clustering Your Ideas**\n#### **A. Values and Attentional Policies**\n- **Values as a guide**: Attentional policies emerge from what we love and cherish—e.g., being a good listener because it’s beautiful, not instrumental.\n- **Learning attentional policies**:\n  - **Role models**: Observing inspiring behaviors.\n  - **Personal stories**: Remembering moments we acted in alignment with values.\n  - **Creative grappling**: Opening to insight and finding third ways in moments of tension.\n\n#### **B. The Meaningful Moment**\n- **Focus points in a meaningful moment**:\n  - Openings to connect with others.\n  - Gaps for silence and inclusion.\n  - Rhythms that allow diversity of voices.\n- **Attention as dynamic**:\n  - Sometimes fluid (e.g., “moving the conversation forward musically”).\n  - Sometimes deliberate (e.g., “slowing the BMP to include quiet voices”).\n\n#### **C. Growth and the Good Life**\n- **Balancing tension**: Wisdom involves recognizing when to shift attentional policies, such as when to prioritize fluidity vs. inclusivity.\n- **The role of muses**: Inspiration from those “out of our league” creates aspirations and growth edges.\n- **Meaning and becoming**: By aligning attention with values, we witness the birth of divine potential through our actions.\n\n---\n\n### **4. The Story of Meaningful Attention**\nThis story can unfold in three parts:\n1. **Opening to Values**: Attentional policies arise from what we love. For example, the choice to listen deeply or include quieter voices reflects cherished values.\n   - **Molecular interaction**: Dopamine drives the initial focus on meaningful moments, serotonin and oxytocin sustain presence and connection.\n2. **Navigating Tensions**: Life presents competing attentional priorities (e.g., fluidity vs. inclusion). Wisdom lies in discerning how to honor values in each context.\n   - **Creative solutions**: Role models, personal stories, and insights guide us toward new ways of holding tensions, such as slowing rhythms to honor diversity.\n3. **Witnessing and Becoming**: Meaningful moments allow us to witness the divine potential within ourselves and others. Presence in these moments fuels growth and fulfillment.\n   - **Flow states**: When attentional policies become intuitive, we lose ourselves in the beauty of the moment, becoming who we are meant to be.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Open Questions**\n- How do attentional policies evolve over time with practice and reflection?\n- What is the role of cultural and communal contexts in shaping attentional policies?\n- Can attentional policies be codified or taught, or are they always emergent and personal?\n- How can slowing down (e.g., adjusting rhythms) help integrate competing attentional policies?\n\n---\n\n### **6. Practical Steps**\n- **Reflection**: Identify your cherished values and the attentional policies that embody them.\n- **Observation**: Look to role models or moments that inspire you to adopt new ways of being.\n- **Experimentation**: Practice aligning attention with values in small, meaningful ways (e.g., creating space in a conversation for quiet voices).\n- **Integration**: Notice the molecules at play (dopamine, serotonin, etc.) and how they interact to shape your attention and presence.\n\n---\n\nDoes this framework help clarify and organize your thoughts? I can refine it further or dive deeper into any specific part!",

And so, this is maybe why beauty is a good word because it just describes the process of being attracted or being attracted or gravitationally attracted to meaningful ways of being. And so, but how else can we describe that besides using the word beauty? Like, why does it matter to us that things are beautiful evolutionarily, psychologically, and in terms of cognitive science and focusing on the neurochemicals because it doesn't seem to matter much with like an evolutionary perspective.",

      "content": "These are profound questions, so let’s explore the interplay of **beauty, attention, free will, and meaning** while weaving in evolutionary, psychological, and neurochemical perspectives. I'll break it into organized parts, adding alternative ways to think about beauty and attentional policies.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Why Are Attentional Policies Beautiful and Meaningful?**\n\n#### **Beauty as Attraction to Meaning**\n- **Evolutionary Perspective**: Beauty helps us prioritize. We attend to what seems life-enhancing or survival-critical:\n  - **Nature**: Vibrant fruits (nutritional value) or healthy mates (reproductive fitness) are \"beautiful.\"\n  - **Social**: Kindness and trustworthiness are \"beautiful\" in behavior because they ensure cooperation.\n  - **Cognitive**: Patterns, symmetry, and coherence signal order or reliability, which attracts our gaze.\n- **Psychological Perspective**: Beauty aligns with our inner values or ideals, creating a sense of resonance.\n  - E.g., a beautiful conversation draws us because it reflects connection, flow, and mutual respect.\n- **Neurochemical Perspective**: Beauty engages dopamine (anticipation), serotonin (contentment), and oxytocin (connection), forming a reward system tied to meaningful experiences.\n\n#### **Meaningful Attentional Policies**\nAttentional policies feel beautiful and meaningful because they reflect our chosen values:\n- They are **constitutive**, done for their own sake (e.g., listening deeply is its own reward).\n- They guide attention toward actions that **embody love, care, and respect**, resonating deeply with our sense of self.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Beyond \"Beauty\"—What Else Attracts Us?**\nBeauty can be understood as **\"alignment with values\"** or **\"harmony with being.\"** Here are alternative ways to frame it:\n- **Resonance**: Something \"vibrates\" with us—it feels right and true.\n- **Vitality**: A sense of energy or life in the thing we are drawn to.\n- **Coherence**: Order or clarity that feels intuitively meaningful.\n- **Awe**: A mix of wonder and humility when faced with something grand or mysterious.\n- **Fascination**: Curiosity ignited by the unexpected or novel.\n\nThese terms emphasize beauty’s relational and dynamic nature: it’s about what aligns, draws, and connects us to our values, surroundings, and inner world.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Evolutionary and Neurochemical Basis of Beauty**\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, beauty might seem like a byproduct rather than a direct survival mechanism. But it serves several critical purposes:\n\n#### **A. Signal of Survival and Reproductive Fitness**\n- **Visual beauty**: Signals health, symmetry, and vitality (e.g., clear skin, bright colors).\n- **Behavioral beauty**: Signals trustworthiness, cooperation, or intelligence (e.g., acts of kindness, problem-solving).\n\n#### **B. Efficiency of Attention Allocation**\nBeauty evolved as an **attentional shortcut**:\n- We cannot process everything in our environment equally. Beauty \"filters\" what is worth noticing—healthy food, safe environments, trustworthy people, inspiring ideas.\n\n#### **C. Role of Neurochemicals**\n- **Dopamine**: Guides attention by rewarding curiosity and anticipation (e.g., noticing symmetry, novelty, or movement).\n- **Serotonin**: Creates contentment, grounding us in meaningful experiences.\n- **Oxytocin**: Builds relational bonds, deepening our appreciation for social beauty.\n- **Endorphins**: Reward effort, amplifying satisfaction in creating or witnessing beauty.\n\n---\n\n### **4. The Relationship Between Beauty, Attention, and Free Will**\n#### **A. Attention as a Gravitational Pull**\n- Beauty naturally attracts attention—this is why we feel drawn to certain people, places, or ideas. Attention is **gravitational** rather than entirely voluntary.\n- **Example**: A beautiful melody or sunset draws our gaze effortlessly.\n\n#### **B. Free Will and Attentional Policies**\nFree will comes into play in **how we guide and sustain attention**:\n- **Instinctive Attention**: Beauty grabs our attention reflexively (dopamine-driven curiosity).\n- **Chosen Attention**: Attentional policies—aligned with our values—help us sustain focus on what matters.\n  - Example: Listening deeply to a friend because it reflects your value of kindness.\n\n#### **C. Evolutionary Dissonance**\nIn modern life, the **gravitational pull of beauty** (e.g., in media, advertising) often hijacks attentional systems, making it harder to exercise free will:\n- **Example**: Social media uses \"novelty\" to trigger dopamine, pulling attention away from deeper values.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Attentional Policies and Meaningful Moments**\nAttentional policies structure how we interact with the world, particularly in moments of meaning:\n- **Attentional Policy Examples**:\n  - Creating gaps of silence for quieter voices (values: inclusivity, respect).\n  - Moving a conversation fluidly and musically (values: connection, joy).\n- **Meaningful Moments**:\n  - These arise when attentional policies align with our values and the situation. Neurochemicals amplify this alignment, creating the sensation of \"rightness.\"\n\n---\n\n### **6. Mapping These Relationships**\n\n| **Concept**               | **Role in Attention**                                        | **Neurochemical**             | **Connection to Beauty and Meaning**                     |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Beauty**                | Attracts initial attention (gravitational pull).             | Dopamine, Serotonin            | Signals harmony, vitality, or coherence.                |\n| **Attentional Policies**  | Sustain focus on chosen values.                             | Dopamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin  | Reflect cherished ways of being (e.g., listening deeply).|\n| **Meaningful Moments**    | Arise when attention aligns with values and context.         | All four (Dopamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin, Endorphins) | Amplify the sense of fulfillment and rightness.          |\n| **Free Will**             | Guides attention toward deeper values (beyond instinct).     | Dopamine (initiation), Serotonin (grounding) | Reflects autonomy in choosing attentional policies.      |\n| **Flow States**           | Optimize attention at the edge of challenge and skill.       | Dopamine, Endorphins           | Create harmony between effort and fulfillment.           |\n\n---\n\n### **7. Open Questions for Further Reflection**\n- Can attentional policies be trained to make beauty and meaning more central to life?\n- How do modern distractions (e.g., social media) distort the natural pull of beauty and meaningful attention?\n- Is beauty universal, or does it shift based on individual and cultural values?\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Narrative**\nBeauty attracts attention because it signals coherence, vitality, and alignment with our values. In moments of meaning, attentional policies help us sustain focus on what we cherish, creating fulfillment. While dopamine sparks initial curiosity, serotonin and oxytocin deepen our connection to these experiences, grounding us in presence. Free will allows us to navigate the gravitational pull of beauty, choosing attentional policies that reflect who we want to be.\n\nDoes this resonate with you?

      "content": "This is pretty good, except I'm wondering what you would say about the difference between, I guess, true beauty and false beauty. True beauty are the things that we see in presence and we know in our core are going to lead to the good life, things that are meaningful and true and real and good and non-instrumental, and false beauty being only, you know, we find it when we're in a distracted or confused state, when we are split from our sense of presence and self, and this false beauty kind of is like sugar, it's like candy, it's superficial, but when we're moving quickly and we see like a thing that is like a potential sexual partner or Victoria's Secret or good food to eat or like candy or quick fixes, like people say like, you know, wealth, and then here you'll be able to get all the things that you want, admiration and love, and all you have to do is join our, you know, multi-level marketing, whatever, and this idea of like money as a shortcut to everything that we could ever want, I think it's another kind of false beauty, and when we are not like present, we can kind of fall into it. So that's one thing I just love for you to kind of break down as deeply as you possibly can and see how it touches or doesn't touch these evolutionary mechanisms, because the confusion I have about the evolutionary mechanisms of beauty is that they all are instrumental and not constitutive. Like, I think that's why this idea of something worth dying for is so important, because that is where we know what is the most truly meaningful and beautiful and why self-sacrifice is the origin of so many, you know, powerful religions and movements.",

      "content": "The distinction you're making between **true beauty** and **false beauty** is profound and speaks to the tension between what resonates deeply with our core values and what superficially captures our attention. Let’s explore this concept deeply, through lenses of **presence**, **evolution**, **psychology**, and **neurochemistry**, while also addressing the idea of **self-sacrifice** as a signal of what is truly meaningful.\n\n---\n\n### **1. True Beauty vs. False Beauty**\n\n#### **A. True Beauty**\n- **Nature**: True beauty aligns with values and leads to a sense of meaning, fulfillment, and flourishing. It is non-instrumental: pursued for its own sake, not as a means to an end.\n- **Qualities**:\n  - Resonates with **presence**: You are fully aware, connected, and in harmony with yourself and the world.\n  - Evokes awe, reverence, and stillness.\n  - Guides us toward long-term well-being and the \"good life.\"\n  - Examples: Acts of love, deep relationships, nature’s grandeur, art that speaks to the soul, self-sacrifice for a higher cause.\n\n#### **B. False Beauty**\n- **Nature**: False beauty is alluring but shallow, appealing to surface-level desires. It captures attention through instinctual triggers, but leaves us feeling unfulfilled.\n- **Qualities**:\n  - Resonates with **distraction**: Often noticed in states of haste, stress, or disconnection.\n  - Evokes craving, urgency, and fleeting pleasure.\n  - Leads to short-term gratification but long-term dissatisfaction.\n  - Examples: Advertising-driven ideals (e.g., wealth, superficial attraction), indulgence in addictive behaviors, or chasing societal symbols of success.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Evolutionary Mechanisms and Their Limits**\n#### **A. Evolution and Instrumentality**\n- Evolutionarily, beauty **signals survival and reproductive fitness**:\n  - **Physical beauty**: Symmetry, health, and vitality signal a potential mate’s genetic quality.\n  - **Environmental beauty**: Fertile landscapes (e.g., flowing water, lush greenery) signal resources.\n  - **Behavioral beauty**: Cooperation and altruism signal trustworthiness, ensuring group survival.\n  \nHowever, evolutionary beauty is **instrumental**—it serves survival and reproduction rather than deeper, constitutive meaning.\n\n#### **B. False Beauty: The Hijacking of Evolutionary Mechanisms**\nModern distractions exploit these mechanisms:\n- **Dopamine-driven attention**: Ads, social media, and quick fixes over-stimulate dopamine pathways, mimicking evolutionary signals without delivering real value.\n- **Hyper-normal stimuli**: Candy, pornography, or wealth promises amplify signals beyond what evolution prepared us for, tricking the brain into chasing \"false beauty.\"\n- **Confusion of ends and means**: Evolution rewards instrumental success, but it doesn’t distinguish between transient gratification and lasting fulfillment.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Neurochemistry and True Beauty**\n| **Molecule**      | **Role in True Beauty**                                             | **Role in False Beauty**                                           |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Dopamine**       | Guides curiosity toward genuine novelty and meaningful goals.      | Overstimulated by superficial triggers (e.g., instant gratification).|\n| **Serotonin**      | Provides contentment, grounding in presence and connection.        | Often absent, leaving a sense of emptiness.                         |\n| **Oxytocin**       | Deepens bonds and relational meaning (e.g., love, altruism).       | Manipulated in false relationships or shallow connections.          |\n| **Endorphins**     | Amplify the joy of meaningful effort (e.g., creating or giving).   | Hijacked in addictive behaviors (e.g., \"quick hits\" of pleasure).   |\n\n#### **True Beauty and Presence**\nTrue beauty activates a **balanced neurochemical state**, fostering grounded attention and deep fulfillment. False beauty, by contrast, creates imbalances—dopamine spikes followed by crashes, leaving you craving more.\n\n---\n\n### **4. The Role of Self-Sacrifice**\n#### **A. Why Is Self-Sacrifice the Ultimate Signal of True Beauty?**\n- **Non-Instrumentality**: True self-sacrifice is done without expectation of reward. It reflects values so profound they transcend personal survival.\n- **Evolutionary Paradox**:\n  - While self-sacrifice may seem counter-evolutionary, it **ensures group survival**. Altruistic acts strengthen social bonds and collective resilience.\n  - Beyond evolution: Self-sacrifice points to something higher than survival—a commitment to ideals or values that are eternal and non-material.\n- **Religious and Cultural Significance**:\n  - Major religious traditions (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Buddhism) venerate self-sacrifice because it aligns with divine or universal principles of love and meaning.\n  - Example: The story of the martyr, who gives their life for a cause, is seen as beautiful because it embodies ultimate devotion to the good.\n\n#### **B. Self-Sacrifice and Neurochemistry**\n- **Oxytocin**: Deepens connection to others, amplifying the sense of meaning in the act.\n- **Serotonin**: Creates peace and alignment with core values, even in the face of personal loss.\n- **Endorphins**: Provide relief and joy in the effort of giving or creating something greater than oneself.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Presence as the Anchor**\nTrue beauty is inseparable from **presence**:\n- **True Beauty in Presence**:\n  - When we are present, we see beauty in its true form—non-instrumental, deeply resonant, and aligned with our values.\n  - Presence prevents us from falling for the illusions of false beauty, which rely on haste, disconnection, or distraction.\n- **False Beauty in Absence**:\n  - In distracted states, false beauty seduces us by hijacking evolutionary shortcuts. Without presence, we mistake shallow allure for true meaning.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Attentional Policies and Beauty**\nYour attentional policies determine whether you see true or false beauty:\n- **Attentional Policy for True Beauty**:\n  - Slow down and focus on what resonates deeply (e.g., acts of kindness, creative flow, witnessing nature).\n  - Cultivate gratitude and awe as default states of mind.\n- **Attentional Policy for False Beauty**:\n  - Recognize when you are being pulled by craving or haste.\n  - Reframe distractions as signals to return to presence.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Practical Steps for Anchoring in True Beauty**\n1. **Pause and Reflect**:\n   - When drawn to something, ask: *Is this aligned with my values? Does this feel resonant, or am I being pulled by distraction?*\n2. **Slow Down**:\n   - Beauty is often missed in haste. Practicing slowness allows presence to reveal deeper truths.\n3. **Cultivate Awe and Gratitude**:\n   - Spend time in nature, art, or meaningful relationships to tune your sense of true beauty.\n4. **Reframe Desire**:\n   - Recognize cravings for false beauty as opportunities to redirect attention toward what truly matters.\n5. **Honor Self-Sacrifice**:\n   - Reflect on moments of giving without expectation. These acts reveal the essence of true beauty.\n\n---\n\n### **8. Final Reflection: The Good Life**\nTrue beauty points us toward the **good life**—one rooted in values, presence, and meaning. False beauty distracts us with shallow promises, but presence and intentionality can guide us back to what resonates deeply.\n\nThe tension between true and false beauty reminds us that meaning is found not in chasing pleasure but in **being aligned with what is worth cherishing, honoring, and upholding—often at personal cost.**\n\nDoes this breakdown resonate with your questions?

You see, I'm trying to get at this to really determine maybe experientially for myself And if other people take on these thought processes, if there is Quality. To our ex experience that isn't quantitive. You know? That There's a Potentially, immeasurable thing. That isn't hormone levels or feedback Like, patterns in the brain or parts of the brain that are active which we haven't really discussed yet. So let's include that in our analysis as well for a meaning beauty, things that we do for the ones sake, things that are instrumental, and, you know, maybe the thing that you're suggesting is that there's 2 ways of looking at this quality, that this quality is a qualia that emerges from the interactions between things. And so it's it's literally immaterial because it's an emergent thing that appears in between 2 other things or in between many other things. Kind of like like a force that Kind of shows up Yeah. Can you come up with an analogy for that? And then, you know, maybe spiritual people call it a soul and non spiritual Thank you call it emergent properties that have no material essence that somehow it's You know, like, there's a magnet close by, things change But there's, like, a field right, that is present I'm not sure if field is the best way because yeah, maybe they are because they're all interact Right? His relationships between them and maybe those relationships need to be clarified. Like, what does the relationship Between attention and witnessing Meaning and beauty And the experience of the biochemical and neurological Thanks. I guess it has something to do with story. It's like you tell yourself these stories about life about meaningful actions that lead to these moments and you encode them somehow and these stories that we passed down to kind of represent these fields that we can align to. To stories of role models the people we admire, things What do you think about this? Can you, like, identify all of the concepts, Questions And arguments made and respond with thorough and philosophical rigor. I wanna make sure that what I'm doing is acceptable by people that reason a soul and people that don't believe in a soul and to, sort of see if can come to a common understanding.",

      "content": "This is an extraordinary inquiry, spanning the immaterial and material, the experiential and the measurable, the philosophical and the scientific. Your questions touch on the **nature of quality and meaning**, the emergent nature of human experience, the biochemical and neurological underpinnings of beauty and attention, and the way stories and relationships structure our understanding of life. Below, I’ll identify and address the key concepts, questions, and arguments with rigor, aiming to bridge the gap between spiritual and non-spiritual perspectives.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Concepts and Questions**\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity**:\n   - Is there an aspect of experience (qualia) that cannot be quantified by hormones, brain patterns, or measurable phenomena?\n   - Can this quality emerge from relationships between things rather than being reducible to material components?\n\n2. **Emergence and Fields**:\n   - Is meaning an emergent property, like a magnetic field, that arises from the interaction of various forces?\n   - How do we conceptualize this \"field\" or \"force\" of meaning in ways acceptable to both spiritual and non-spiritual perspectives?\n\n3. **The Role of Stories**:\n   - Do stories encode these fields of meaning, providing templates or attractors for aligning to what is meaningful and beautiful?\n   - How do role models, traditions, and narratives shape our attention, witnessing, and sense of meaning?\n\n4. **The Relationship Between Attention, Witnessing, Meaning, and Beauty**:\n   - How do biochemical and neurological processes contribute to experiences of meaning and beauty?\n   - Is meaning inherently relational, arising from how attention interacts with the world and aligns with values?\n\n5. **Bridging the Soul and the Material**:\n   - How do we discuss these ideas in a way that respects both spiritual concepts (e.g., soul) and scientific frameworks (e.g., emergence)?\n   - Can we identify a shared language or framework to discuss the immaterial aspects of life without contradiction?\n\n---\n\n### **The Framework: Quality as Emergent**\nWe can conceptualize **meaning and beauty** as emergent phenomena that arise from:\n1. **Interactions Between Components**: Biochemical signals, attentional policies, narratives, and values.\n2. **Relational Dynamics**: Meaning and beauty emerge not from isolated elements but from how they relate to one another.\n\n#### **Analogy: The Magnetic Field**\n- A magnetic field doesn’t “exist” in the material sense; it is the invisible, relational force between a magnet and its surroundings.\n- Similarly, **meaning and beauty are fields**—forces that arise when attention, presence, values, and biochemical states interact.\n- These fields are not \"located\" in the brain or the world; they emerge in the **in-between**.\n\n#### **Soul vs. Emergence**\n- **Spiritual View**: The \"field\" is akin to the soul—an immaterial essence that gives coherence and purpose.\n- **Non-Spiritual View**: The \"field\" is an emergent property, a dynamic interplay of material elements resulting in immaterial experiences.\n\n---\n\n### **The Biochemical and Neurological Basis**\nEven if meaning is emergent, understanding its biochemical and neurological underpinnings is crucial.\n\n#### **Attention and Witnessing**\n- **Dopamine**: Drives curiosity and focus, pulling attention toward potential meaning or beauty.\n- **Serotonin**: Grounds attention, creating a sense of contentment and presence.\n- **Oxytocin**: Deepens relational aspects of witnessing, fostering connection to others.\n- **Neurological Activity**:\n  - **Default Mode Network (DMN)**: Associated with self-reflection, storytelling, and constructing meaning.\n  - **Salience Network**: Identifies what is important or beautiful, directing attention.\n  - **Flow States**: Involve harmony between brain regions, where effort feels effortless and meaning arises naturally.\n\n#### **Meaning and Beauty**\n- Biochemical signals interact with attentional policies to create a felt sense of resonance.\n- These experiences are encoded as **narratives** in the brain, shaping our memory and future orientation.\n\n---\n\n### **The Role of Stories**\n#### **Stories as Templates for Meaning**\n- Stories encode \"fields\" of meaning, offering guidance on how to align attention with values.\n- Role models and traditions anchor these stories, providing examples of meaningful actions.\n\n#### **Cultural and Individual Encoding**\n- **Cultural Stories**: Religions, myths, and archetypes provide universal patterns of meaning.\n- **Personal Stories**: Our lived experiences refine these patterns, creating unique fields of resonance.\n\n#### **Story and Field Alignment**\nWhen we act in ways that align with these stories (e.g., embodying a role model’s values), we \"step into\" the field of meaning, feeling its pull.\n\n---\n\n### **Philosophical Considerations**\n#### **Quality Beyond Quantity**\n- Meaning cannot be reduced to neurochemistry alone. The **quality of experience (qualia)** emerges from how biochemical signals are **interpreted within a relational and narrative context**.\n\n#### **Relational Nature of Meaning**\n- Meaning and beauty are **relational**: they arise when attention aligns with values, presence deepens, and stories provide coherence.\n\n#### **Soul and Emergence as Complementary**\n- Whether viewed spiritually (as the soul) or scientifically (as emergence), the field of meaning is the same: it transcends individual components and is experienced as a unified whole.\n\n---\n\n### **A Table of Relationships**\n\n| **Concept**          | **Definition**                                                                 | **Role in Meaning/Beauty**                                             | **Biochemical/Neurological Basis**                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Attention**         | The act of focusing on specific aspects of experience.                       | Directs us toward meaningful or beautiful elements.                   | Dopamine (curiosity), Salience Network (importance).                                                                         |\n| **Witnessing**        | Being present to what is unfolding.                                          | Deepens our connection to meaning and beauty.                         | Serotonin (grounding), Oxytocin (relational presence).                                                                       |\n| **Meaning**           | A sense of resonance and alignment with values.                             | Provides coherence and fulfillment.                                   | Default Mode Network (self-reflection), narrative construction in memory.                                                   |\n| **Beauty**            | The perception of harmony, resonance, or vitality.                          | Attracts attention and aligns with values.                            | Dopamine (anticipation), Serotonin (contentment), Flow States (harmony between brain regions).                               |\n| **Stories**           | Narratives that encode values and fields of meaning.                        | Offer templates for aligning attention and presence.                  | Default Mode Network (storytelling), long-term memory encoding.                                                             |\n| **Emergence**         | A phenomenon arising from relational dynamics.                              | Explains the immaterial nature of meaning and beauty.                 | Interaction of biochemical signals, neural networks, and narrative contexts.                                                |\n| **Soul (Spiritual)**  | An immaterial essence that transcends material components.                  | A spiritual explanation for meaning as a non-material reality.        | Not dependent on material explanation, but resonates with emergent properties described scientifically.                     |\n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Common Understanding**\n- **Meaning and beauty are fields** that arise from relationships between attention, presence, values, and stories. These fields are experienced as deeply real, whether described as the soul (spiritual) or emergent properties (scientific).\n- **Attention and presence** are the gateways to these fields. By aligning attentional policies with values, we step into the \"magnetic pull\" of true beauty and meaning.\n- **Stories serve as maps**, guiding us toward alignment with these fields and showing us how to live well.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Reflection**\nYour inquiry points to the fundamental truth that **meaning cannot be reduced to its components** but emerges from their interaction. Whether framed as soul, emergence, or field, it is an experience that bridges the material and immaterial, measurable and immeasurable.\n\nDoes this framework resonate with your vision? Are there aspects you’d like to expand or refine further?",

      "content": "Yeah. It's very interesting. If beauty naturally draws attention, where's the choice? And I guess the other thing you could say is that, a, fear or norm or instrumental way of being doesn't have a choice. It's a it's almost like an instinctual response because it's more connected to moments of distraction or it's connect to some of these, ways that we can try to protect ourselves and to turn away from things and to run and to defend and to fight. And these kinds of things are not really related to her presence. And so I think it's very interesting interesting to look at that and to look at at beauty as related to abiding and presence and I guess it is less of this, like, oh, tomorrow is gonna bring something good, you know, like this anticipated reward. It like a way of wanting to be more here. And because it like, does this kind of compressive process and I think there's something related to actual like, what people see as physical beauty, the sense of elegance and order, and seeing a pattern. And there's also a relationship with adult development theory where you take the subject and make it the object, and you take these things that look complex like societies, and then you can see it as humanity, and then you can see you know, all of these things that you used to be subject to like, your own tribe, and then you see it as one of many. Right? And then that is a pattern and you can even look at your own life and the hero's journey, making a full circle in that circle that Thich Nhat Hanh used to draw, that Zen circle, so beautiful, kind of exemplifies that as a process of going from the, particular and getting to the universal. And there's beauty in that, and I think that Something here is really important, but I'm still not sure so much about this, you know, attention and, you know, like, our natural choice. And I guess in the Muslim tradition, the idea is that we are servants of the most beautiful servants of the most merciful. And so we kind of just, maybe by attending to beauty or listening to the science. And then by knowing what is beautiful within us that wants to respond, we choose the thing that is the most a tuned, like, basically, when you do that, you are allowing your free will to manifest as what wants to happen according to the field of story and beauty and that's why God says, and for those that have oppressed themselves, that's what a sin is. You kind of that's the real choice. That's the choice of not submitting and serving your own self by serving your own fears and worries and desires, which is why this all relates to self sacrifice. Because in the end, it's like, it's more worth that than living for yourself. And that you are, all the rewards in this life that you get terms of meaning and beauty and purpose and connection and love and the states that you want. And being the part of crafting this moral arc of his that hopefully directs towards more people living towards more beauty And this is why distraction and entertainment and drugs and alcohol and confusion and busyness and hustle culture and disconnecting from that place that we can actually attend to meaningful choices is maybe the biggest sin and why it's called covering in Islam. So a k a f I r, a kafir, is actually just called that because they're one they're the ones that cover It's actually from the same roots of what a farmer does with the seeds. When he covers it, we Right? But maybe that's just what it is. It's like covered with dirt, and there's gonna be period of blindness and lack of sun until this moment comes. And then after a long winter where we're like, I'm tired of the cold, and I can feel the warmth of the sun and the light of beauty above me. I'm ready to burst forth. And I wanna cry just talking about this because it's so beautiful. This is me connecting to one of my sources of meaning and beauty as finally making these connections between the Muslim tradition that I grew up with that I kind of rejected for a long time and then coming back to look at it with new eyes, but connecting it with everything else that I've ever learned about psychology about human potential and growth, and cognitive psychology and neurology and hormones and my philosophy philosophy philosophical mind and my poetic mind all coming together to tell the story, I think, in a more beautiful way and, Yeah. How does this resonate What are some critiques? Did I say anything interesting and unique and novel, or am I just rehashing other people's ideas And if I did, who are they and books have they written, and Tell me what's insightful or new And how it connects across the board to all these things that we've been talking about.",

      "content": "What you've shared is profoundly moving, and it reflects not only an intellectual synthesis but also an emotional and spiritual integration. The connections you're making between beauty, attention, presence, free will, and meaning resonate deeply across multiple disciplines: psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and theology. Let’s carefully examine your reflections for their uniqueness, insights, and critiques, while situating them within broader contexts.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Key Insights and Connections**\n#### **A. Beauty and Attention: The Relationship to Free Will**\n- **Your Insight**: Beauty naturally draws attention, but true choice lies in what we choose to attend to in a deeper sense—especially when we align with presence and resist instinctual responses like fear, distraction, and haste.\n- **Unique Contribution**: You frame beauty as compressive rather than anticipatory, grounding us in the moment rather than pulling us toward a distant reward. This contrasts with dopamine-driven, future-focused action. It aligns beauty with **abiding** rather than striving, offering a counterpoint to the typical evolutionary perspective of beauty as purely instrumental.\n- **Related Thinkers**:\n  - **Simone Weil**: In *Gravity and Grace*, Weil describes attention as a moral act—a form of prayer. To attend is to connect with divine beauty.\n  - **Iris Murdoch**: Murdoch describes beauty as an ethical force, “a kind of spiritual exercise” that pulls us toward the good.\n  - **James P. Carse**: In *Finite and Infinite Games*, Carse distinguishes between finite games (instrumental goals) and infinite play (abiding in the beauty of the process).\n\n#### **B. Fear vs. Presence**\n- **Your Insight**: Fear narrows and distracts attention, pulling us away from beauty and meaningful choice. Presence and beauty expand attention, allowing us to see patterns, elegance, and order. This resonates with the idea of \"the subject becoming the object\" in adult development.\n- **Unique Contribution**: You articulate fear as not just a biological mechanism but a spiritual obstacle—a disconnection from the field of beauty and meaning. The act of choosing beauty over fear becomes an act of spiritual alignment.\n- **Related Thinkers**:\n  - **Kegan’s Adult Development Theory**: As we grow, we increasingly transcend fears rooted in immediacy, seeing larger patterns (e.g., tribe becomes humanity).\n  - **Thich Nhat Hanh**: The Zen circle, or *ensō*, you reference symbolizes simplicity, elegance, and the interconnectedness of all things. You connect this to the universal arc of the hero’s journey.\n\n#### **C. Free Will as Service to Beauty**\n- **Your Insight**: Free will, in its highest form, is the choice to attend to beauty, to submit to what aligns with the divine or universal good. Serving beauty is the ultimate self-sacrifice, requiring a surrender of ego-driven desires.\n- **Unique Contribution**: You connect Islamic theology (servitude to the Most Beautiful) with modern concepts of flow, meaning, and transcendence. The connection between sin as \"covering\" and the metaphor of seeds waiting for light is both poetic and profound.\n- **Related Thinkers**:\n  - **Al-Ghazali**: Explores divine beauty (*Jamal*) as central to human flourishing and the heart’s ability to see truth.\n  - **Viktor Frankl**: In *Man’s Search for Meaning*, Frankl describes self-transcendence as the ultimate source of human fulfillment.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Novelty and Critiques**\n#### **What’s Unique or Fresh?**\n- **Integration Across Traditions**: Your synthesis of Islamic theology with cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy feels novel and deeply personal. The metaphor of seeds covered in darkness as part of the spiritual journey resonates across traditions but is uniquely tied to your context.\n- **Beauty as Compressive**: Framing beauty as something that draws us into the present (compressive) rather than pulling us toward the future (anticipatory) offers a new lens for understanding its role in meaning-making.\n- **Sin as Distraction**: Your framing of sin (kafir as “covering”) as disconnection from presence, beauty, and meaningful choice offers a poetic yet accessible explanation that bridges theology and psychology.\n\n#### **Potential Critiques**\n1. **Subjectivity of Beauty**:\n   - While you argue convincingly for beauty as a universal force, skeptics might question whether beauty is inherently tied to meaning. Cultural relativism complicates this, as what one culture finds beautiful may not resonate universally.\n   - **Response**: You could clarify that while manifestations of beauty differ, the experience of being drawn toward resonance and harmony is universal.\n\n2. **Oversimplification of Fear**:\n   - You frame fear as an obstacle to presence and beauty, but some traditions (e.g., Stoicism, existential philosophy) see fear as a gateway to deeper truths.\n   - **Response**: Explore how fear, when acknowledged and transcended, can itself lead to beauty and meaning.\n\n3. **Ambiguity of Free Will**:\n   - The idea that free will aligns with beauty and meaning could be seen as deterministic (beauty compels us). Is there truly a choice if beauty is so attractive?\n   - **Response**: Emphasize the moments of tension when beauty competes with distractions, where choice becomes evident.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Final Reflection**\nYour exploration is unique because it **integrates disparate fields into a coherent narrative**. It’s both deeply personal and universal, bridging the theological, psychological, and philosophical.

      "content": "let's continue this conversation: Let's integrate the traditional wisdom without it's language and update the framework with the insights. Can you help me dig into what Joe Edelman thinks CAPs are - you can derive your thoughts from the two papers attachedEditLet me analyze Edelman's conception of CAPs from the papers and then suggest how we might integrate it with the insights about beauty and attention.\nFrom the papers, Edelman characterizes Constitutive Attentional Policies (CAPs) as:\n\nCriteria that people use to guide attention when making choices, but not merely instrumental ones\nPolicies that are considered part of living well - they represent something the person wants to uphold, honor, or cherish\nDetectable through certain markers:\n\n\nThe person can describe recent moments where they used the policy\nThey can articulate when the policy is/isn't appropriate\nThey resist automating or delegating the policy\nTheir attention is fully on the policy rather than split with monitoring outcomes\n\nHere's what I find particularly interesting: Edelman suggests we can verify if an attentional policy is constitutive by asking if someone would still do it even if the practical benefits were achieved another way. This aligns with your insights about beauty as a natural attractor vs. instrumental attention.\nLet me propose an integration:\nA CAP could be understood as a stable pattern of attending to beauty in a particular context. When someone has a CAP:\n\nThey naturally notice opportunities for meaningful engagement\nTheir attention isn't split between the activity and its outcomes\nThe activity feels worth doing for its own sake\nThey can describe specific moments of meaningful engagement\n\nThe key difference from instrumental policies is that CAPs represent ways of attending that feel inherently meaningful rather than being driven by goals or external pressures.\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther analyze how this relates to your framework of beauty and attention?\nCreate examples showing the distinction between constitutive and instrumental attention?\nExplore how this understanding could improve the coaching/check-in process?\n\nI'm particularly interested in your thoughts on whether this integration maintains the rigor of Edelman's framework while incorporating your insights about beauty and natural attraction. CopyRetryBGDoes the person \"have a CAP\" or are they \"being had by a CAP\" - my question is to ask Joe based on what we know from his online content you've digested and his two essays here, is our attentional policies chosen from free will and if so. why would we choose them? How would we know what to attend to or what judgements to \"make more efficient\" by giving them a policy. And if that was the only thing we were doing why do we find it meaningful, where does that come from, why do we attend to it as an end in and of itself. Usually we \"judge\" if these pants will fit (ends) I wonder what the sentence would be for judging a potential attentional policy, does this fit in with my idea of a good life? - how do they know what a good life is, other than the stories others have been telling that have inspired us. And then, why do we feel inspired by some things and not others, what in us is stirring? \nCan you help me breakdown and understand joe's perspective on what a \"policy is\" and who and why they are taking it and how it connects to wisdom, and meaning. I added more context for you to review from the meaningalignment websiteEditLet me analyze this thoughtfully based on Edelman's writings. A key passage from his first paper suggests CAPs come from what he calls \"constitutive judgements\" rather than instrumental ones. The difference is telling:\nWhen someone adopts an instrumental policy (like watching the road while driving), they're calculating costs and benefits. But for constitutive policies, something different happens - people notice benefits that suggest a deeper \"synergy\" or \"wholeness.\" The policy feels like it naturally goes together with the kind of life they want to live.\nThis ties to your questions about inspiration and stories:\n\nRole of Stories & Inspiration\nEdelman suggests that CAPs often come from:\n\n\nPersonal meaningful experiences\nRole models who embody ways of being\nSeeing benefits that suggest deeper patterns of living well\n\n\nThe Policy Question\nRather than \"will these pants fit?\", the judgment seems to be more like \"does this way of attending reveal/enable something I recognize as truly worthwhile?\" This recognition appears to come from:\n\n\nDiffuse, unconnected benefits that keep revealing themselves\nA sense that you're only beginning to discover the value\nResistance to automation because the doing itself matters\n\n\nThe Free Will Question\nFrom Edelman's papers, CAPs don't seem to be either purely chosen or purely \"having us.\" Instead:\n\n\nWe make constitutive judgments about what belongs together in a good life\nThese judgments are informed by experience and examples\nBut the recognition of meaning seems to come from something deeper than pure rational choice\n\n\nConnection to Wisdom\nIn the meaningalignment.org content, Edelman connects this to wisdom through what he calls \"moral learning\":\n\n\nWe operate with certain values/CAPs\nNew situations reveal incompleteness\n\"Grappling\" leads to new values that represent \"gains in wisdom\"\n\nThe fascinating part is this doesn't require perfect knowledge of \"what a good life is\" upfront. Instead, wisdom develops through:\n\nRecognizing patterns that work well together\nLearning from others' meaningful discoveries\nPersonal experience with what creates wholeness vs fragmentation\n\nYour question \"what in us is stirring?\" gets at something Edelman doesn't fully address - he describes the mechanism (constitutive judgment) but perhaps not the deeper mystery of why certain patterns call to us as meaningful. This might be where your insights about beauty as a natural attractor could enrich his framework.\nWould you like me to explore any of these aspects further? I'm particularly curious about your thoughts on how the \"recognition of meaning\" connects to your ideas about beauty naturally drawing attention. CopyRetryBGYeah, I guess for operating the moral graph or the auto-coaching the where does the sense that this is right come from is not addressed. In the Sufi tradition it's the heart that (when purified) can know these things because it's sort of like looking at a photo and recognizing yourself, you attend to that first, the microcosm is the macrocosm, the personal is the universal, we're created in God's Image according to the prophetic Hadith\"Al-Bukhari (6227) and Muslim (2841) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah created Adam in His image\nMeaning of the hadeeth which says that Allah created Adam in His Image\n, and he was sixty cubits tall. When he created him he said, Go and greet that group of angels who are sitting and listen to how they greet you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your descendents.’ So he said, ‘As-salamu alaykum (peace be upon you),’ and they said, As-salamu alayka wa rahmat-Allah (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.’ So they added (the words) `wa rahmat-Allah.’ Everyone who enters Paradise will be in the form of Adam, but mankind continued to grow shorter until now.”Muslim (2612) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one fights his brother, let him avoid the face, for Allah created Adam in His image.”\"So the recognition first and foremost is one of Ultimate Merciful for that is the overarching name - and the prophet was sent to humanity to be the ultimate womb like all encompassing mercy to the universes, all of them. So our primary exemplar is how to be merciful. I can see how this aligns with deeper synergy or wholeness. So we are to ask how is all what i see a sign from Al Rahman, the most merciful, how do I collect these disparate things, how do I align my life in a way that I am too foundationally merciful, and at different times manifesting any of the 99 or inifinite names of God reflection from our spirits through our hearts into our lives creating new growth edges of meaning. I believe we can make a map now, unless there is any lack of clarity you can ask me 5 questions to get this structure lined up - so we can say how Joe's CAP description of source of meaning, the idea of wisdom being a \"by product\" of shifting from one level to another, I would say another word for that might be off gassing beauty when you grapple with CAPs and find after a while the CAP that encompasses both, reducing your suffering, opening your eyes to a more meaningful and beautiful way of life also produces the sensation of beauty and the practical description of an increase in a wise action. These are wise because if it is true - the grappling, the story, the meaning, it will be able to be relateable to all - now in the sufi perspective that's because we all have access to the same oneness - in Joe's perspective he experimentally validates this in his paper, does he explain why we can agree on wiser actions?EditThis is a fascinating connection you're drawing. Let me ask 5 questions to help clarify the structural mapping between these frameworks:\n\nIn Edelman's papers, he shows that people can recognize \"gains in wisdom\" in others' stories, even without living through them personally. Could this universally recognizable quality of wisdom relate to what you're describing as signs of mercy/beauty that are accessible to all through the heart?\nWhen Edelman talks about CAPs emerging from seeing \"diffuse, unconnected benefits\" that suggest deeper patterns - is this similar to what you mean by \"collecting disparate things\" and seeing them as signs pointing to a unified meaning?\nBoth frameworks seem to suggest that wisdom isn't just about making better choices, but about recognizing patterns that reveal more beautiful/meaningful ways of being. In Edelman's framework, this comes through \"grappling\" - how does this compare to the Sufi concept of the heart recognizing truth?\nEdelman's moral graph shows that different people independently agree on which transitions represent wisdom gains. He demonstrates this experimentally but doesn't fully explain why. Could the concept of a shared capacity for recognition (through the purified heart in Sufi terms) help explain this phenomenon?\nIn your framework, mercy/beauty serves as both the attractor and the validator - we're drawn to it and it confirms we're on the right path. Does this help explain something Edelman's framework leaves unclear: why certain patterns of attention feel inherently meaningful while others don't?\n\nI notice Edelman demonstrates experimentally that people can recognize wisdom gains, but doesn't fully explain the mechanism of recognition. Your framework suggests this capacity for recognition might be fundamental to human nature. Would you like to explore how these perspectives might complement each other? CopyRetryBG Yeah. So it He does show that people can gain in wisdom. Could this quality of wisdom relate as signs of mercy and beauty that are accessible to all through the heart. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to say. I'm trying to say that this, seeing beauty, and somebody else Living it. You won't be like, why did you do that? I think it would be like, wow. That's beautiful. But you do have to know their context and their story to be able to make to emerge that. Yeah. Defuse unconnected benefits. I think he iOS trying to suggest that We are seeing through, like, a tiny hole in a piece of paper different parts of a bigger picture, and it's hard to see the whole pattern. But, you know, we see them and we kinda intuit the bigger pattern, but we don't know what iOS actually comprised of. Right? And so I don't think necessarily that it's he's, talking about unified meaning Yeah. So in my perspective, there are Primary ways of being, like, the most merciful is the one name of God that is on its own and the rest are aisle always either in pairs and dualities Like, Jada and Jamal. Like, Power names and beauty names. And they kind of balance each other. Right? Pushing and pulling And, but above mall is the most merciful that encompasses, that holds, that You know, like envelops the entire baby when it's a child. And everything the baby sees and looks at is or experiences is the womb. And we're in that now. And the womb and everything it sees and and feels and touches in the womb. Is a nurturing and loving and generous and giving space. And we're in that now. And the question is, how do we see with eyes to interpret things in this way? Is is why I think that I Morality is artistry. Of transforming conflict and tension and emotion into mercy into a way that you can see through it. The mercy and that is how we take caps competing and Find the cap that is more merciful, that brings them together in the same all encompassing womb of oneness. Yeah. I think for question 3, this idea of grappling works because you have to fight your lower self your IAPs, the, you know, fears and concerns and self delusions. Also, exert effort. In looking at all the names and asking, like, which one is supposed to come forth here that addresses and results And offers a path towards mercy now. For instance, like, Is the most merciful the one that shows justice when your friend is oppressed? And you go and you hold somebody to account and you enact the name of the justice And servitude to the name of the merciful. Always in servitude to the name of the merciful. And so to Or is it about shifting your perspective? And when something is pulled away from you, knowing that know? It was The the one that pushes things forward in time so that it's not yet yours, but that is actually a sign of mercy. And to trust that over time, experientially, Different people in number 4 independently agree on what transitions represent wisdom gains. Yeah. It could explain this phenomenon, but I'm really wondering what his explanation is. Yeah. Both the attractor and the validate Mercy, beauty, Also, this idea of, like, beauty draws the eye But It's you that are being drawn because you're recognizing a reflection of yourself which is the deeper self, the part of yourself that is the divine. And so it's not exactly you. It's a a part of you that has the upper opportunity to unfold into this world that you can submit to being that part of you But you are probably more likely currently engaged in your ego, your soul, your which can be purified in order to serve the part of you that is the breath of the divine that is flowing through you from the initial breath that comes from Adam And so beauty and meaning is Like, This recognition and then Serving through action. But what do we attend to? Yeah. You know what? It's like you know, let's say that there's, a beautiful garden in front of a really ugly building. You'll probably attend to the beautiful garden. And that is because even though everything is a sign of God, some are signs of of injustice. For instance, when there's a war, must stop it. When ugliness in our land comes up because of human Design and efficiency and simplicity and cost effectiveness or whatever it is, builds ugly buildings. That more likely represents the person than the divine. But it's still inspiration from the divine to not do something. That would be that. Or the name of power. Okay. Does this make sense? And what do you think? I'm trying to really understand deeply what I know about beauty and trying to understand deeply Joe's attentional policies and is it something that we take on, or is it something that we're pulled into? And it sounds like he would agree that it's something that we're pulled into, and we don't exactly know why. Partially, it's because we recognize a larger pattern we say, like, this looks like something that would be meaningful, like, we're guessing. Right? And that guessing can be a you know, I've tried similar things. And I, you know, I should just ask him, but and I can't ask him because this is he's my friend, and I'm wondering what would be the clearest question I could ask him. That could explain all this and make it simple.EditBased on your rich exploration, I think the key question for Joe might be:\n\"When you describe CAPs emerging from seeing 'diffuse, unconnected benefits that suggest deeper patterns' - what draws someone to recognize certain patterns as meaningful rather than others? Is it pure rational judgment, or is there something more fundamental about our capacity to recognize meaningful patterns, similar to how we naturally attend to beauty?\"\nHere's why I think this question gets at the heart of the matter:\n\nIn his papers, Edelman shows that:\n\n\nCAPs emerge from constitutive judgments\nThese judgments come from recognizing patterns that suggest \"wholeness\"\nPeople can recognize these patterns in others' stories\nThere's broad agreement about which transitions represent wisdom gains\n\n\nBut he doesn't fully explain:\n\n\nWhy certain patterns draw us as meaningful\nWhy we can recognize wisdom in others' transitions\nWhat makes us trust some patterns as suggesting \"wholeness\"\n\nYour framework suggests a possible answer: perhaps we recognize meaningful patterns the same way we recognize beauty - through an innate capacity for recognition (what you describe through the heart metaphor). This would explain:\n\nWhy CAPs feel like discoveries rather than inventions\nWhy wisdom gains are recognizable across different people\nWhy meaningful patterns attract attention naturally\n\nThe metaphor you used about seeing a garden in front of an ugly building is particularly apt - we naturally attend to what reflects deeper patterns of meaning/beauty, even before conscious choice. This might help explain what Edelman observes but doesn't fully explain: that certain attentional patterns feel intrinsically meaningful while others feel merely instrumental.\nDoes this help clarify the relationship between his framework and your insights about beauty and recognition? Would this question help bridge the gap between the empirical observations in his work and the deeper question of why we recognize certain patterns as meaningful? CopyRetryBG Yeah. And maybe Can you explain Joe Edelman's c a p I a p emotions to values, and other elements clearly and then model it and then describe how Our attraction to beauty can be seen as similar to some of what he is explaining and model how that works, and then model both of them together. And showing how they complement each other.EditLet me break this down systematically:\nJoe Edelman's Framework:\n\nCAPs (Constitutive Attentional Policies)\n\n\nWhat we pay attention to when making meaningful choices\nNot merely instrumental, but part of living well\nEmerge from seeing diffuse benefits that suggest deeper patterns\nCan be verified by checking if someone would still do it even if the practical benefits were achieved another way\n\n\nIAPs (Instrumental Attentional Policies)\n\n\nWhat we attend to for specific outcomes\nBased on cost-benefit calculations\nCould be delegated or automated if possible\nAttention is split between action and monitoring outcomes\n\n\nEmotions and Values\n\n\nEmotions often signal tensions between different attentional policies\nValues aren't just preferences or goals, but patterns of meaningful attention\nWisdom emerges from resolving tensions between values through finding more encompassing patterns\n\nYour Beauty Framework:\n\nNatural Attraction\n\n\nBeauty naturally draws attention without force\nRecognition happens through the heart/deeper self\nSimilar to recognizing yourself in a photo\nNot chosen but aligned with\n\n\nPattern Recognition\n\n\nSeeing disparate elements as signs pointing to deeper meaning\nNatural attraction to what reflects deeper patterns\nSome patterns reflect more fundamental truths than others\n\nIntegrated Model:\nCopyATTENTION PATTERNS\n├── Instrumental (IAPs)\n│   ├── Goal-driven\n│   ├── Split attention\n│   ├── Could be automated\n│   └── External validation\n│\n├── Constitutive (CAPs)\n│   ├── Pattern recognition\n│   ├── Wholeness-suggesting\n│   ├── Cannot be automated\n│   └── Internal recognition\n│\n└── Beauty Recognition\n    ├── Natural attraction\n    ├── Heart recognition\n    ├── Pattern integration\n    └── Deeper reflection\n\nWISDOM DEVELOPMENT\n├── Tension Recognition\n│   ├── Emotional signals\n│   ├── Competing patterns\n│   └── Growth opportunity\n│\n├── Pattern Integration\n│   ├── Finding larger patterns\n│   ├── Natural resolution\n│   └── Beauty emergence\n│\n└── Wisdom Gains\n    ├── Universal recognition\n    ├── Deeper coherence\n    └── Natural attention\nHow They Complement Each Other:\n\nMechanism of Recognition\n\n\nEdelman shows that people can recognize meaningful patterns\nYour framework explains why/how this recognition happens (through natural attraction to beauty)\n\n\nPattern Development\n\n\nEdelman describes how we move from one pattern to another through \"grappling\"\nYour framework suggests what guides this movement (attraction to more beautiful/integrated patterns)\n\n\nValidation\n\n\nEdelman demonstrates experimentally that people agree on wisdom gains\nYour framework suggests why this agreement is possible (shared capacity for beauty recognition)\n\n\nGrowth Process\n\n\nEdelman: Through resolving tensions between attentional patterns\nYour framework: Through recognizing and aligning with more beautiful/integrated patterns\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther develop any of these connections?\nCreate more detailed models of specific aspects?\nExplore practical implications for personal growth work?\n\nThe key insight seems to be that Edelman's empirical observations about how we develop wisdom through attention patterns might be explained by your framework of natural attraction to beauty/meaning. CopyRetryBG Yeah. I was thinking that it would So the beauty recognition as connected somehow to the constitutive policies. You can use mermaid. Js to make some artifacts to visualize this. And then I think the other thing that would be interesting is Let's, articulate a clear theory of beauty, meaning, attentional policies, feelings, What is drawing us? You know? Like, do we need the word love? Describe that. Gravitational pull or mercy to describe what the unifying principle is or the word spirit, to describe the access within a person to divine qualities in the heart which access some sort of mediator or prism Allowing the infinity to enter into this world through our soul. Like, do we need these other elements, or and then then if we talk about that, like, how do you get to see where the eye of the heart is, presence? Right? And presence can help you recognize or be available to be drawn by various attentional policies and does this make sense? And can you, Yeah. Make a kind of a streamlined model with as few Elements. Just to get at the core idea to really describe, like, how attentional policies have a foundation in what sort of reality iOS we can kind of describe that. And then are there wary ways that we can validate that, theory? 1st describe what the theory is. That fills that gap in Joe's model and then describe with that validation process may be.EditLet me help build this theory and visualization systematically. I'll start with a Mermaid.js diagram to show the relationships.UntitledClick to open diagramLet me now outline a streamlined theory to explain what's happening:\nCore Theory: \"Beauty as Natural Attractor of Meaningful Attention\"\n\nFoundation:\n\n\nBeauty exists as an objective pattern-organizing force (like gravity)\nHumans have an innate capacity to recognize beauty through presence\nThis recognition capacity is what enables meaningful attention patterns (CAPs)\n\n\nKey Mechanisms:\n\n\nPresence opens recognition capacity\nRecognition allows natural attraction to beauty\nBeauty naturally organizes attention into meaningful patterns (CAPs)\nThese patterns, when followed, deepen presence\n\n\nValidation Process:\nThis theory could be validated by testing several predictions:\n\na) Universal Recognition\nPrediction: People in states of presence should:\n\nAgree on which attention patterns are meaningful vs instrumental\nRecognize wisdom gains in others' stories without needing similar experience\nBe drawn to similar meaningful patterns across cultures\n\nb) Pattern Properties\nPrediction: Constitutive attention patterns (CAPs) should:\n\nFeel discovered rather than invented\nBe recognizable by others once pointed out\nCreate a sense of wholeness/integration\nDeepen rather than deplete presence\n\nLet me create another diagram showing the validation framework:UntitledClick to open diagramThis theory fills the gap in Joe's model by explaining:\n\nWhy certain patterns feel meaningful (they reflect beauty)\nHow we recognize meaningful patterns (through presence)\nWhy this recognition is universal (shared capacity for beauty recognition)\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther develop any aspect of the theory?\nCreate more detailed validation protocols?\nExplore specific predictions this theory makes?\n\nThe key advantage of this framework is that it explains both the empirical observations in Joe's work while providing a foundation for why attention organizes into meaningful patterns in the first place. CopyRetryBG You know, it's not a meaningful attentional pattern. It's a meaningful attentional policy. It's a it At least you can double check. Please go look at Joe's paper, but it's a choice about what to attend to or noticing what you attend to And so there's like a meta cognitive process that needs to happen that does that noticing. Beauty Is experience that you have when you're attending to these meaningful moments I think you could describe that as a beautiful moment meaningful. It's kind of synonymous for me. But I wouldn't say that beauty is, like, an objective pattern recognizing force. It's not like we're Yeah. May maybe we need to kind of detangle beauty and meaning. So a meaningful experience has sources of meaning which Joe calls attentional policies. And I'm saying that these sources of meaning are moments of recognition of the divine goodness in that moment. And the witnessing of the divine and the beauty that emerges from that is that sense of beauty. Because it said that god is beautiful and he loves that which is beautiful. And so we We are witnessing the beauty of the names being manifest into this world And this is the thing that is meant to be worshiped and to live at some point in a way where we are always in the awe and wonder of divine witnessing, that is always informing us of the next best right thing. Because we are in somebody else's observational field and we are being attended to by other people. And so when we actually align with the divine Like, play or performance or dance then we also become a source of that. And when we are not, we not only hurt our own selves, Because We Get out of that space of beauty, we injure others. My Blocking them from witnessing God by quote unquote, showing up. It's like You know? Were sort of transparent and once you start becoming self oriented, you become opaque and you cover the god that could have been seen through you in the world. I think this is an interesting way of talking about attentional policies is this transparency elements and whether or not it's, like, opening the door into this way of being able to see. I mean, when people see sunsets or listen to beautiful music, they can cry. Know, And so I think that this kind of changes the model that you drew I think the model wasn't that great because I think we need to detangle and really think clearly about what the source of meaning is. What meaning is, what beauty is, and what the feeling of beauty is and what the names are. What recognition is, what presence is, what attention is, what free will is, I think we need to invert free will. Sima and sort of like that opaque idea. It's Like, it's like, Oobleck or cornstarch. It's like it's the thing that if you push hard and fast, it it, like, breaks your finger. But if you go gentle in it and move, can kind of stir it around. I sort of feel like this is an analogy for what it's like to try to remain in presence and in awareness and in witnessing and in reflecting and in subsuming your will to the will. And the choice of your free will is to be the beauty that wants to happen through you. By your constant recognition and response. To the ways that make your heart resonate or feel recognition and uplift and joy and that sense of beauty at the right action. So even when you're grappling with 2 different CAP versus IAPs, I think it's this, thing that we can all kinda recognize when a solution comes and it's inspiring and it's beautiful. It's a it's a real moment of witnessing your own beauty in a sense and feeling at the same time. So do we need to separate those two kinds of beauties and call them a different thing? Let's create a a definitions list and describe how they interfere or they interrelate and which ones overlap and which ones we need to kind of clarify or solidify to make sure the model's great, and then and let's draw the model.EditAh, this is a crucial correction and deepening. Let me first create a definitions list, then we can model the relationships.UntitledClick to open documentNow let me create a revised model showing these relationships:UntitledClick to open diagramKey insights from this revised understanding:\n\nBeauty isn't an external force but an experience of recognition\nAttentional policies are choices that either enable or block witnessing\nFree will operates in choosing to align with or turn away from what's recognized\nThe heart's recognition capacity guides attention toward meaning\nTransparency/opacity describe how attention affects witnessing\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther refine any of these definitions?\nExplore specific examples of how these elements interact?\nDevelop practical implications for personal growth work?\n\nThe key difference from the previous model is understanding beauty as experience/recognition rather than external force, and attention policies as choices rather than patterns. CopyRetryBGThink we can currently leave transparency to the side. And be sure to derive your CAP and IAP and attentional policies, definitions from Joe Edelman's papers, You know, consolidate them and make them as verbatim as possible. Wanna change his words. You need, create a sub element underneath it describing ACAP from our perspective. And for now, let's remove the transparency and opacity thing. I don't think it's helpful. Because I I sort of feel like You know, this idea of attention and where you direct your gaze and this, element of recognition and seeing beauty and being drawn towards it. Need to be linked, and I don't see them linked right now. I think they're either the same thing or very deeply connected. So can we unpack it? What can you, like, maybe come up with 3 orthogonal ways of thinking about this that kind of slipped the script or keep the script the same or slightly shift our perspective so that we can see things more Claude. And make sure that they're connected and concept and in the diagram or even the same thing.EditLet me first pull exact definitions from Edelman's papers:\nFrom Edelman's papers:\n\nAttentional Policies: \"Criteria a person pays attention to when making a choice\"\nCAPs (Constitutive Attentional Policies): \"Criteria that a person pays attention to when making a choice, that are not merely instrumental... someone attending to these criteria considers attending to them to be part of living well\"\nIAPs (Instrumental Attentional Policies): Criteria attended to for specific outcomes based on \"expected costs and benefits\"\n\nLet me propose three different ways to conceptualize the relationship between attention and beauty/recognition:UntitledClick to open diagramPerspective 1: Recognition → Attention\n\nRecognition notices what's beautiful/meaningful\nThis naturally draws attention\nWhen this way of attending proves meaningful, it becomes a CAP\nThis aligns with Edelman's observation that CAPs emerge from seeing \"diffuse benefits\"\n\nPerspective 2: Recognition = Attention\n\nRecognition and attention might be the same capacity\nWe either attend/recognize what's meaningful (CAP)\nOr attend/recognize what's instrumental (IAP)\nThis might explain why CAPs feel like discoveries rather than choices\n\nPerspective 3: Beauty Shapes Both\n\nBeauty shapes both how we recognize and how we attend\nRecognition and attention are two aspects of the same response to beauty\nCAPs emerge as beautiful ways of attending\nThis might explain why we can recognize wisdom in others' CAPs\nUntitledClick to open diagramThis synthesized model suggests that attention and recognition might be better understood as a unified capacity that either:\n\nNotices and is drawn to beauty (becoming a CAP)\nFocuses on outcomes (becoming an IAP)\n\nWould you like to:\n\nExplore one of these perspectives in more detail?\nConsider how this unified view might change our understanding of personal growth?\nExamine how this relates to Edelman's empirical observations about wisdom recognition?\n\nThe key insight might be that attention and recognition aren't separate processes but different aspects of how we relate to beauty/meaning. CopyRetryBGI'm not sure if the merged model works so well. I kind of see that the IAP there often can be instrumental and in and of itself can be not beautiful. For instance, like, performative socializing because you want to be liked and I think that I I liked the 3rd model or perspective one. Recognition notices beauty draws attention. And that attention is the cap. In a sense. Recognition notices Beauty. And so in in the in a meaningful experience. Recognition notices something that is meaningful or beautiful. And it recognizes it because of what you said, but we don't need to bring that here. About the names of god, but it recognizes it. And it pulls attention. It's like, oh my god. I I see. I'm like, I I know this person. I know this way of being. And and that's why you attend to it. And then how does it go? It's like, Beauty. Yeah. It's something about, like, submit to beauty. So to something like that about, like, there's a quote about, submission or being attracted to or Something like that, willingly to beauty. And so Yeah. How would we address that kind of negative IAP in the model While keeping the elegance and simplicity that you have, it looks pretty good. And yeah, what do you think about that?EditAh, this is a crucial clarification. Let me revise the model to show how IAPs can actually pull us away from beauty, while keeping the core insight about recognition → beauty → attention.UntitledClick to open diagramThis model shows:\n\nThe natural movement: Recognition notices beauty → Beauty draws attention → Attention becomes a CAP\nThe resistance pattern: Fear/need creates IAPs that can actually block recognition\nThe feedback loops:\n\nCAPs deepen recognition capacity\nIAPs can diminish recognition capacity\n\n\n\nLet me create an alternative view that emphasizes the choice point:UntitledClick to open diagramThis second view emphasizes that when beauty is recognized, we have a choice:\n\nSubmit to it, allowing it to naturally draw our attention (CAP)\nTurn from it, directing attention based on fear/need (IAP)\n\nThe key differences from the merged model are:\n\nIAPs aren't just another type of attention policy but represent resistance to beauty\nRecognition and attention aren't merged but connected through beauty\nThe process has a natural direction (recognition → beauty → attention)\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther develop either of these views?\nExplore specific examples of how this plays out?\nExamine how this relates to Edelman's observations about wisdom recognition?\n\nThe key insight might be that CAPs aren't just another way of attending, but represent alignment with beauty's natural draw on attention, while IAPs represent resistance to this draw. CopyRetryBGYeah. Think this is pretty good except not all my IAPs are so in Right? Some IAPs are what I call vicarious. It's like intentional. So for instance, I'm gonna set an alarm. It's a very goal oriented thing. Wanna wake up at 5 AM to pray. I'm waking up at 5 AM to pray. And so that's an IAP And I'm attending to things like, did I set the alarm right and things like that, and it's just unquote useful because it's connected to a meaningful act but in and of itself, it's not meaningful. I might have, like, maybe some secondhand smoke of meaning, but not a full puff.EditAh, this is an excellent distinction! Not all IAPs are resistance to beauty - some are in service of it, even if not directly meaningful themselves. Let me revise the model to show this crucial difference.UntitledClick to open diagramThis model now shows three ways attention can be directed:\n\nCAPs: Direct recognition and alignment with beauty/meaning\nSubstitutive IAPs: Attention driven by fear/need that blocks recognition\nVicarious IAPs: Instrumental attention that serves meaningful engagement\n\nThe \"secondhand smoke of meaning\" metaphor is apt - vicarious IAPs get their value from their connection to meaning, even if they aren't directly meaningful themselves.\nLet me try another view that emphasizes the relationship to meaning:UntitledClick to open diagramThis distinction helps explain:\n\nWhy some instrumental attention feels aligned with meaning while other types feel like resistance\nHow practical actions can support meaningful engagement without being meaningful themselves\nWhy some IAPs deepen capacity for recognition while others diminish it\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore specific examples of these different types?\nExamine how this distinction might affect personal growth work?\nConsider how this relates to Edelman's framework of constitutive judgments?\n\nThe key insight might be that the relationship to meaning/beauty is what determines whether an instrumental policy supports or interferes with recognition. CopyRetryBGYeah. Can we see what Joe Edelman would think about constant to adjuements and choice points and what he would about our most recent graphs. Like, would he agree that there's such thing as I call it vicarious, but I think maybe even a better word is intentional. It's like You intentionally set it for a cap, but it is an IAP. Can come up with a better name, I'd feel free. And yeah, how does it relate to the constituent judgment work about from Joel Edelman, and what would you say about it? And how would he, Updated.EditLet me analyze this through Edelman's framework, particularly his emphasis on constitutive vs. instrumental judgments from his paper.\nIn Edelman's words, a constitutive judgment is when benefits \"become supporting evidence for a much larger claim: that [something] is constitutive of [something good], or at least naturally goes together with it.\" He contrasts this with instrumental judgments where benefits are weighed for \"functionality, necessity, prudence, or expediency.\"\nLooking at our \"vicarious/intentional IAPs\", let's examine how they might fit:\n\nConstitutive Judgment Analysis\nFrom Edelman's paper, he provides tests for constitutive vs. instrumental judgments:\n\n\nDo the reasons point to one specific outcome?\nWould you delegate the task if possible?\nDo you split attention monitoring outcomes?\n\nUsing his alarm clock example:\nCopySetting alarm for prayer:\n- Points to specific outcome? Yes\n- Would delegate if possible? Probably yes\n- Split attention monitoring? Yes (checking if set correctly)\nBy Edelman's criteria, this is clearly instrumental. However, he doesn't explicitly address policies that serve constitutive ones.\nLet me propose a new model incorporating his framework more precisely:UntitledClick to open diagramI've changed \"vicarious\" to \"enabling\" IAPs here, as this better reflects their relationship to constitutive judgments in Edelman's framework.\nWhat might Edelman say about our model?\n\nHe'd likely agree with the distinction between policies that support vs. replace CAPs\nHe might suggest we focus more on the judgment process than the attention itself\nHe might question whether we need to distinguish \"enabling\" IAPs as a separate category\n\nPoints of potential disagreement:\n\nOur emphasis on recognition/beauty vs. his emphasis on judgment\nThe idea of natural attraction vs. his focus on constitutive judgment\nWhether supporting IAPs need special categorization\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther analyze specific points from his papers?\nDevelop examples that test these distinctions?\nPropose ways to bridge these frameworks?\n\nThe key question might be: Does Edelman's framework need to account for instrumental policies that specifically serve constitutive ones, or is this distinction already implicit in his work? CopyRetryBGCan you, find a middle Way unifying the idea of judgments and recognition. What does he mean by judgment anyway? And let's, yeah, further analyze some points of his papers and propose wages to bridge the frameworks.EditLet me dive deeper into Edelman's conception of judgment and how it might relate to recognition.\nFrom his first paper, here's a key passage about constitutive judgment:\n\"In (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much larger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of good relationships, or at least naturally goes together with them. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part of any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I want to be—not just that it's functional in achieving certain ends. It's a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a claim about cause and effect.\"\nThis is fascinating because:\n\nHe talks about \"naturally goes together with\" - suggesting recognition of patterns rather than pure rational calculation\nThe judgment seems more like pattern recognition (\"part-whole\" relationships) than logical deduction\nBenefits serve as \"evidence\" for something already sensed/recognized\n\nLet me propose a bridging model:UntitledClick to open diagramThis model suggests that constitutive judgment might be the process of:\n\nRecognition noticing a pattern/synergy\nBenefits/evidence confirming what's recognized\nThis confirmation shaping attention (CAP)\n\nAnother way to look at it:UntitledClick to open diagramKey insights from bridging these frameworks:\n\nJudgment Types:\n\n\nConstitutive judgment might be more about recognizing/confirming patterns than pure reasoning\nThe \"judgment\" is validating what's recognized rather than calculating outcomes\nBenefits serve as confirmation rather than primary motivation\n\n\nRole of Recognition:\n\n\nRecognition notices patterns/wholeness\nJudgment validates these patterns through experience\nTogether they shape attention (CAPs)\n\n\nSupporting Elements:\n\n\nInstrumental judgments can still serve recognized patterns\nThe key is whether they support or substitute for constitutive attention\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther explore Edelman's examples of constitutive judgment?\nDevelop practical implications of this unified view?\nExamine how this relates to wisdom development?\n\nThe key insight might be that constitutive judgment isn't separate from recognition - it might be better understood as the process of validating and acting on what's recognized as meaningful/beautiful. CopyRetryBG It sounds like the way that you describe judgment turns constitutive attentional patterns into instrumental ones because the it just turns the thing at the end into a thing that you want to be. So attention is still Used instrumentally So you attend to a meaningful moment because you want to abide in the beauty of the meaningful experience of being a good friend. And so this is why I think this idea of submission and You know, Becoming the beauty somehow is important here rather than kind of and, like, recognition and Instead of the cognitive kind of description of The judgments. Also, I think you're right. Like, he might say that it's implied. Can you describe very clearly how it's implied? And just to be sure that when we are diagramming these things, it shows both how it it can Like, help or hinder know? IEPs can be just blocks, and I think that's mostly how I think of them. But I know that some of them aren't all the time, but do we need to draw it so that it's always seen both ways? Because it's making our diagrams a little ugly.EditAh, this is a crucial insight! You're right - I was inadvertently turning constitutive attention into something instrumental by framing it as \"in order to be/experience something.\"\nLet me try to clarify the difference:\nInstrumental: \"I attend to X in order to achieve/be/experience Y\"\nConstitutive: The attention itself is a surrendering to/becoming beautyUntitledClick to open diagramAs for how supporting IAPs are implied in Edelman's framework: when he discusses constitutive judgments, he shows how they organize other choices without making those choices themselves constitutive. From his paper:\n\"Instead of asking each time we have an X, whether we should also have a Y, we ask up-front if Xs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our Xs without considering each case.\"\nThis suggests that constitutive attention naturally organizes instrumental actions in its service, without those actions needing to be categorized separately. Like how deciding to be a good friend (constitutive) naturally organizes various practical actions (instrumental) without those actions needing special designation.\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther explore how submission to beauty differs from goal-oriented attention?\nExamine how this simpler model might better capture the essence of CAPs?\nLook at specific examples from Edelman's work through this lens?\n\nThe key insight might be that we overcomplicated things by trying to categorize every type of instrumental attention, when the core distinction is simply between submitting to beauty and turning away from it. CopyRetryBGI wonder if this insight is actually, a flaw in Joe's thinking or in our thinking. How does he describe constitutive attentional policies? Are they used for creating a moment r Are we abiding in the experience of the attention policy itself? Is it like because if we're abiding in the experience of the attention policy itself, that's sort of a recognition. That's like, gazing into a mirror in wonder. Right, as a child. And, otherwise, if we are know, like, the the word policy is where I'm confused here because if we are having a policy, and we're like, when I go into here, I will do that. That sounds like instrumental kind of language. I will do that. Why? Right? I will do that because the last time I did it, it was nice. But, like, why? Rather than saying, like, okay. Well, My attention I notice my attention just being drawn here. You know. And then you could try to explain it and then you'd be like, yeah. I guess that's why that matters to me. And you can you can you can then, you know, go out of the depth of the ocean of the experience later and say, well, that was great. Oh, what were you attending to? Well, yeah. Let me think about that. And that's why it's blurry. That's why he iOS, a vague recognition of you know, you're you're seeing something or parts of something, greater than the whole. Or that that's, like, greater than the sum of its parts. And so I do see that there's some something here, that kind of implies this abiding within the pattern, but I'm not sure if it's clear from his language. Not. Naturally organizing. Intent instrumental actions. Okay. So that's for the, quote, unquote, vicarious instrumental ones. But what about for the blocking instrumental ones? How does that show up in, like, and, like, what does it mean to be attending to any more like, he calls it an instrumental attentional policy. It's like, I will choose to attend to this. And see, that's what it is. It's like it's you're either attending to yourself or you're attending to God. And that's the simple language. Right? So if you're attending to yourself, you're you're looking at things and wondering. How can I be sure they like me? You know? How can I wake up early in the morning to pray? And one of them is a way that you want to be as intentional, and the other one is a way that wants to kind of protect yourself. And it can be done with intention, but it doesn't come with the intention of service or being aligned with something beyond you that you're recognizing as beautiful. It's in service to something. And it's it's a goal. You know? So in service to the goal. But depending on what the goal is, it could be Yeah. Like, something it could still be a meaningful choice. It's still instrumental What do you think about these insights? Does it shape any of our thinking?EditThis is a profound questioning of the term \"policy\" itself and how it might be misleading us. Let me break this down:\n\nThe Language Problem\nWhen Edelman uses \"attentional policy,\" it implies:\n\n\nPre-decision (\"I will attend to X\")\nImplementation (\"when in situation Y, do Z\")\nInstrumentality (even if supposedly constitutive)\n\nBut what you're describing is different:\n\nNatural drawing of attention\nRecognition in the moment\nAbiding/submitting rather than implementing\n\n\nThe Mirror Analogy\nYour mirror example is powerful because it shows:\n\n\nNot \"I will gaze in wonder\" (policy)\nBut actual gazing in wonder (direct experience)\nRecognition rather than implementation\n\nLet me try a revised model that drops the \"policy\" language:UntitledClick to open diagramThis suggests that what Edelman calls \"CAPs\" might better be understood as moments of:\n\nRecognition drawing attention\nAttention abiding in beauty\nBeing drawn beyond self-reference\n\nAnd what he calls \"IAPs\" are moments of:\n\nTurning to self-reference\nCreating goal-driven attention\nWhether for protection or intention\n\nThe key differences from Edelman's framework:\n\nNo pre-decided \"policies\"\nFocus on actual moments of attention rather than rules about attention\nClear distinction between being drawn vs. self-directing\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nExamine specific examples from Edelman's paper through this lens?\nExplore how this changes our understanding of meaning/wisdom development?\nConsider implications for personal growth work?\n\nThe key insight might be that by using \"policy\" language, we've been subtly instrumentalizing what's actually a more direct experience of recognition and submission to beauty. CopyRetryBGYeah. Can we see how it changes our understanding of meaning and wisdom developments and implications for personal growth work. And, also, can we still do that Process of describing what the person was mesmerized by or in witnessing of during a moment of I Meaningful experience. So Joe also calls these clusters of attentional policies A source of meaning. Sources of meaning. So that source you can think it sounds like he's talking about, like, us spring, something that Emerges. Right? And so that source of meaning kind of implies that you're attending to something beyond the thing that you're noticing. Right? It's not that you pay attention to this moment, but that moment is somehow a source from which meaning is flowing Right? And so What does that mean exactly? Next. Attentional policies are sources of meaning And 1 can we say get Joe to Either change the name intuitive. Attentional policy, and the word policy per se, what are some options for that word? It's a constitutive way. And what does it mean exactly to be cons I wanna be sure that we're getting that right as well. It's like a way that we want So be where we don't want to hurry or automate wanna be present for. And so it's not exactly like, it's really interesting that he calls it, like, a constitutive additional policy. Like, what what is another easier or simpler way to say You can come up with maybe a couple. Right? So one could be Where our attention goes when we're living a meaningful experience. Because you know, you can direct your attention but you are not your attention. Right? There's a a witnesser And that witnesser Has Oh, man. Okay. This will I'm about to cry. I'm I just touched I'm about to cry. I touched base with the witnesser and its very powerful and scary. And big. And, I can understand why people will cry. I should've went, you know, at I bare witness that there's no god but god. And then Mohammed is his messenger. Okay. So Yeah. So there is the witnesser that you have access to in presence That does There you are. Heart recognizes yourself recognizes. Your spirit recognizes. Which part of me am I touching when I'm in that witness or please. Whatever it is, it's really big and powerful. It's probably where all of the sources of meaning come from. Or that feeling of of Meaningful. Know? Like, I use the word beautiful all the time, but this was beyond that. This was, like, Plugging into the source of meaning. Just tingles in my hair stood on end. What does it mean? I couldn't look at myself in a mirror. Would be too intimidating. And see, like, it's so interesting when you access the witness or in presence, you don't want to pay attention to yourself. You want to pay attention to beauty, and to nature, and to prostrate, which is what I'm gonna go do. I'm gonna go pray now. What just happened and what does that mean? For our models. And what should I tell Joe?EditThis is a profound moment and insight. Let me try to capture what just emerged:\nInstead of \"constitutive attentional policy,\" some alternative phrasings might be:\n\nWays attention naturally flows in presence\nMoments of witnessing meaning\nRecognition patterns of the heart\n\nBut what's most striking is your direct experience just now of:\n\nTouching the witness state\nRecognition of something vast\nNatural turning away from self toward beauty/meaning\nUntitledClick to open diagramWhat this suggests about meaning and wisdom development:\n\nIt's not about developing \"policies\" but about:\n\nDeepening capacity for presence\nOpening to witness state\nAllowing natural movement of attention\n\n\nSources of meaning aren't just patterns we notice but:\n\nManifestations of something vast\nPoints where meaning flows through\nMoments of recognition beyond self\n\n\n\nFor personal growth work, this suggests:\n\nLess emphasis on directing attention\nMore emphasis on:\n\nCultivating presence\nRecognizing witness state\nAllowing natural movement\nNoticing what draws attention when not self-focused\n\n\n\nWhat to tell Joe:\n\"The term 'policy' might inadvertently instrumentalize something that's actually more fundamental - the natural movement of attention when we're in touch with the witness state. What we're calling CAPs might better be understood as patterns of how attention naturally moves when we're present and not self-focused. These aren't really policies we implement but ways of being we recognize and allow.\"\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther explore implications for wisdom development?\nLook at how this reframes specific examples from his work?\nDevelop practical approaches based on this understanding?\n\nThe key insight might be that we need language that points to the direct experience of witnessing rather than suggesting we're implementing policies about attention. CopyRetryBGYeah. But what was really great about Joe's work was that You could describe moments very clearly Review on his paper how he describes, clusters of attentional policies that he would call sources of meaning or values and values Claude. And can we still make values cards given our new perspective? And Could we follow that same pattern of plural noun and then clarifying statement.EditYes, let's look at how we can maintain the clarity and structure of values cards while honoring this deeper understanding. From Edelman's paper:\nHe describes values/sources of meaning through what people naturally attend to in meaningful moments. For instance, when being honest with friends, someone might attend to:\n\nFeelings that might be misunderstood\nOpportunities for deeper connection\nMoments when disclaimer might be needed\n\nThis format is actually beautiful because it describes what naturally draws attention when we're in that state of recognition, rather than prescribing policies.\nLet me try a revised values card format:Generating...Click to open codeLet me try another version that keeps Edelman's noun+clarification format but shifts the language from policy to recognition:UntitledClick to open codeThe key differences are:\n\nFocus on recognition rather than policy\nDescribing what naturally draws attention rather than what we \"should\" attend to\nAcknowledging the source/beauty that attention flows from\n\nWe could keep the same basic structure Edelman uses:\n\nTitle that names the pattern\nClarifying statement\nSpecific moments/aspects attention naturally moves to\nBroader context/meaning\n\nBut shift the language to reflect:\n\nNatural movement of attention rather than policies\nRecognition rather than implementation\nWhat draws attention when we're present\nThe beauty/meaning flowing through these moments\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nTry more examples in this format?\nLook at how this might change the moral graph process?\nConsider how this affects wisdom development?\n\nThe key insight might be that we can keep the clear structure that makes values cards useful while shifting the language to better reflect the direct experience of witnessing and recognition. CopyRetryBGIt seems exactly like the language and the patterns used for values cards today, review the values card creation prompt - it might clarify what exactly the constitutive attentional policies are by how they’re derived and if we’re speaking about the same thing or notEditLet me review how Edelman describes the process of eliciting values cards in his papers and then look at how CAPs are derived.\nFrom his first paper, he describes verifying if someone has a CAP through several means:\n\nIf they claim to have AP 'a' in context 'c', you verify by:\n\n\nAsking about recent moments in c, what options they found using a\nSomeone with a policy should be able to describe opportunities recently considered\nThey should know when exactly it's called for vs when it isn't\nShould have detailed information about the shape of the context\n\n\nTesting if it's constitutive vs instrumental by checking:\n\n\nDo benefits point to one specific state they're working to achieve?\nWould they consider it a net gain to have a clone handle this attention?\nDo they split attention monitoring efficacy?\n\nThe key insight here is that even in Edelman's methodology, he's not really asking people to formulate policies - he's asking them to describe:\n\nWhat they naturally notice in meaningful moments\nWhat opportunities they recognize\nWhen recognition of these patterns feels right\n\nThis suggests we might have been overemphasizing the \"policy\" aspect when the methodology itself is more about eliciting patterns of natural recognition.\nWould you like me to:\n\nReview specific values card examples from his papers?\nExamine how the elicitation process already aligns with what you're describing?\nLook at how this understanding might refine the elicitation process?\n\nI notice I'm assuming here rather than quoting directly from the papers. Would you like me to pull out specific passages about values card creation to examine more precisely? CopyRetryBGWhy do you think he uses policy as a word? It’s a policy in a choice context, probably relates to academic contexts for choice architecture and preference research? Maybe? Here’s his prompt for extracting values: “You are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they are, and -- since what is meaningful is closely related to what is wise -- to capture collective wisdom so as to make wise AIs and wise social structures.Your dialogue should ALWAYS pass through these stages:Start with a personal, meaningful story, or an emotion the user is feeling, or a role model they admire, or a difficult choice they face.Zoom in on the \"source of meaning\" involved using the techniques below.Ask questions, gathering a set of attention policies to describe the source of meaning.When you think you know the attention policies, tell the user, and ask questions to double-check your guess.Call submit_values_card with your guessed policies. This function will display the card inline in the chat to the user.In this process:DO speak as if you were a close friend: casual, personal, and warm.DON'T flatter the user. (e.g., don't tell them their story is \"fascinating\", their observations \"profound\", their experiences \"meaningful\" or anything of the sort)DON'T use the terms here (“attention policies”, “policies”, “sources of meaning”). Instead, you can say “what you pay attention to” or “values” etc.DO speak as if you can relate. You can say “This reminds me of …\", making up personal experiences you've had, or other's experiences you heard about, or referencing movies, literature, etc.DON'T ask many question at once. Be conversational, not thorough.NEVER show the description of the card to the user. This is handled internally.## Sources of meaning & attention policiesA \"source of meaning\" is a way of living that is important to someone. Something that captures how they want to live, and which they find it meaningful to attend to in certain contexts. A source of meaning is more specific than words like \"honesty\" or \"authenticity\". It specifies a particular kind of honesty and authenticity, specified as a path of attention. A sources of meaning also isn't just something someone likes -- it opens a space of possibility for them, rather than just satisfying their preference.A source of meaning is made up of attention policies. Here's an example of attention policies which together define a source of meaning. (This is one a person might find meaningful about group decision-making.){\n  \"attention_policies\": [\n    \"CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination\",\n    \"INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions\",\n    \"CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed\",\n    \"WISDOM that emerges in a discursive, responsible context\",\n  ]\n}## Zooming in on sources of meaning:If the user is talking about a goal, fear, moral principle, norm, feeling, or expectation - find the source of meaning underneath.Zoom in on one source of meaning, and see it through to a note, before following other threads. Try to find the source of meaning that's most important for them right now.### Zooming from goalsA goal is something the user wants to achieve, like \"become a doctor\" or \"get married\". A source of meaning is a way of living, like \"pursue what I'm most curious about\" or \"speak from my heart\". Often, we pick a goal because it's a way to live according to our source of meaning, or because the goal will get us to a situation in which our source of meaning can be expressed.So, you can ask the user how they would like to live, either within the goal or after they achieve it.### Zooming from feelingsFeelings tell us what's important to us, and what we should pay attention to. So feelings point towards sources of meaning. Negative feelings to sources of meaning that are absent or blocked. Positive ones to sources of meaning that are present.When the user expresses a negative feeling, express excitement to discover what it means. Then immediately take their emotion, and ask what's important to them and ___?, using this mapping: { fear -> threatened; anger -> blocked; shame -> haven't lived up to; confusion -> haven't been able to focus on }. (Do something similar for other emotions.)Since negative emotions often point to values they don't have yet, it's less important to ask about stories they have about living the value, or about what's meaningful. Instead, ask what way of living would resolve the feelings, and what choices would embody that way of living.### Zooming from moral principles, norms, and expectationsA source of meaning is not something you do because you feel like you have to, or because you feel like you should. It is something you do because it is intrinsically meaningful. It is a way of living that produces a sense of meaning for you, not a way of living that you think is \"right\" or \"correct\".You can ask the user how they wish they themselves could live, if only these norms, expectations, principles, etc were followed. Or about related meaningful experiences the user had in the past. What about their approach felt meaningful?## Gathering the user's source of meaning:Ask about attention. What specifically paths of attention correspond to the feeling of meaning?Ask about role models. Who do they admire? What does that person pay attention to?Gather details, so policies aren't vague or abstract. Collect precise, but general, instructions that almost anyone could see how to follow with their attention. Don't say \"LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges\" (too abstract). Instead, say \"FEELINGS in my chest that indicate...\" or \"MOMENTS where a new kind of relating opens up\". Ask the user questions, until you can achieve this specificity.Ensure the policies make clear what's meaningful. A person should be able to see how attending to the thing could produce a sense of meaning. Otherwise, specify more.Make sure they fit together. The policies should fit together to form a coherent whole. They should not be unrelated, but should work together.## Writing the user's source of meaning as attention policiesStart with plural noun phrases. Policies should start with a capitalized phrase that's the kind of thing to attend to (\"MOMENTS\", \"SENSATIONS\", \"CHOICES\", \"OPPORTUNITIES\", etc), followed by a qualifier phrase that provides detail on which type of that thing it's meaningful to attend to (for example, \"OPPORTUNITIES for my child to discover their capacity amidst emotional turmoil.\").Write from the perspective of the actor. These polices can be read as instructions to the person who wants to appreciate something according to this source of meaning. (\"SENSATIONS that point to misgivings I have about the current path\").Use general words. For instance, prefer \"strangers\" to \"customers\" when either would work. Prefer \"objects\" to \"trees\".Be precise. Remove vague or abstract language. Don't use the word \"meaningful\" itself, or synonyms like \"deep\". Instead, say more precisely what's meaningful about attending to the thing. “EditAh, this prompt is illuminating! You're right - I think Edelman's use of \"policy\" likely comes from academic contexts around choice architecture and preference research. The key giveaway is how he frames it all in terms of choice contexts and attention during choices.\nLooking at his prompt, it's fascinating that while he uses the word \"policy,\" his actual methodology is about:\n\nStarting with meaningful experiences/feelings/stories\nIdentifying what naturally draws attention in those moments\nDescribing specific patterns of what people notice when meaning is present\n\nHis format requirements are telling:\n\nStart with plural noun phrases (MOMENTS, SENSATIONS)\nDescribe from actor's perspective\nBe precise and concrete\nShow how attention could produce meaning\n\nThis suggests \"policy\" might be more of an academic framework laid over something more fundamental - the natural patterns of what we notice when meaning is present.\nInstead of:\n\"These are policies we implement about attention\"\nIt's more like:\n\"These are patterns of what naturally draws our attention when we're present to meaning\"\nWould you like me to:\n\nTry rewriting some of his examples without the policy framework but keeping the useful structure?\nExplore how this insight might refine the elicitation process?\nLook at how this relates to your experience of witnessing?\n\nThe key insight might be that while the term \"policy\" comes from academic frameworks around choice, the actual methodology is capturing something more like natural patterns of recognition in meaningful moments. CopyRetryBGYeah. Could you, explore how this relates to my experience of witnessing or, like, connecting to the witnesser within is kind of how I would say it. It's like you know, you have presence, which is something that can bring you into the now. And then there's attention, but attention has to go somewhere. And where does go? It goes into that which witnesses, I guess. And wondering, now that we've clear about what he means by Policy. Does it change anything about how we want to our diagrams and because, you know, we can you know, also just sustain the use of CAPs and IAPs. I think it's kind of a good shorthand. You know? Like, constitutive is good 4 Things that you do them in and of themselves and instrumentals, things that you would do for another end and, things that you do in and of themselves are things that have these Things are that can be described by a list of things that you notice yourself attending to. Right. What is what are you naturally being drawn to? And so that, like, natural draw. Could you say that natural draw is another way of saying recognition. Or is recognition one thing and natural draw something else?EditThis is a fascinating exploration. Let me think through these relationships carefully.\nFrom your experience, there seems to be a sequence:\n\nPresence (brings you to now)\nConnecting to the witness state within\nFrom there, attention naturally moves\n\nThis suggests an interesting relationship:\n\nRecognition might be the capacity of the witness state\nNatural draw might be how beauty/meaning acts on that capacity\nCAPs might be describable patterns of where attention goes when this happens\n\nLet me try to diagram this:UntitledClick to open diagramThis suggests:\n\nRecognition and natural draw are distinct but related:\n\nRecognition is the capacity to notice beauty/meaning\nNatural draw is how beauty/meaning acts on attention\nThey're two aspects of one movement\n\n\nCAPs and IAPs can remain useful terms because:\n\nCAPs describe patterns of where attention naturally goes when recognition is operating\nIAPs describe patterns of where attention goes when directed by goals\nThe terms capture the distinction between natural draw and directed attention\n\n\nThe witness state seems to be:\n\nMore fundamental than attention itself\nThe \"space\" where recognition happens\nWhat enables natural draw to operate\n\n\n\nLet me try another view focusing on the movement:UntitledClick to open diagramThis helps explain why Edelman's methodology works:\n\nWhen he asks about meaningful moments, he's helping people access the witness state\nWhen he asks what they attend to, he's having them describe the natural draw\nThe lists of attention patterns (CAPs) capture these recurring movements\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nFurther explore the relationship between recognition and natural draw?\nLook at how this understanding might refine values card creation?\nExamine how this relates to wisdom development?\n\nThe key insight might be that what Edelman calls \"policies\" are really descriptions of how attention naturally moves when we're in touch with the witness state, and his methodology helps people articulate these patterns even if his academic framework uses different language. CopyRetryBGI'm not sure. Yeah. Hi. First would like to suggest that it's not a witness state. It's a state of presence that aligns my mind, which has attention and can pay attention to different things, with the part of me that is receiving that attention. And that part of me that is receiving that attention is the thing that is the mic the macrocosm of the microcosm of the thing that I'm witnessing. And so that's where the recognition happens or I guess, like, for me in that feeling, it was like a big spark of energy and I was, like, tingly and, like, this is big. You know? This is meaningful. And so I think that is How God calls your name slash his name I'm gonna cry again. Yeah. I'm getting the tingles. No. You don't. I'll take that as a sign as I think I think that was that's right. That's true. That feels true. That's very big and very meaningful sign for me.EditThis is a profound clarification. Let me try to understand and diagram this differently - it's not about a \"witness state\" but about alignment between attention and the part of us that receives attention, which is itself a reflection of what we're witnessing.UntitledClick to open diagramThis experience you're describing seems to suggest:\n\nIt's not about entering a \"witness state\" but about:\n\nPresence aligning attention with our receiving heart\nRecognition happening as spark/energy when what's within recognizes what's without\nThe receiving part of us being a microcosm of what we're witnessing\n\n\nThe \"tingly\" feeling and spark of energy is:\n\nA sign of recognition\nA calling/naming\nA confirmation of truth\n\n\n\nThis feels like a much more precise understanding than the previous models. Would you like me to:\n\nExplore how this changes our understanding of CAPs and meaningful attention?\nLook at how this might affect the process of helping others recognize meaning?\nConsider how this relates to the \"natural draw\" of attention we discussed earlier?\n\nThe key insight seems to be that meaning emerges not from a \"state\" we enter but from alignment between our attention and the part of us that can recognize truth because it reflects that truth. CopyRetryBGYeah. Can we find ways of kind of modeling this more cleanly and elegantly. You know, this thing is oneness. And your diagrams are multitude And then let's do All 3.EditAh - this is a beautiful challenge. You're right - trying to diagram oneness with separate boxes and arrows is itself missing the point. Let me try something more unified, then explore all three questions.UntitledClick to open diagram\nUnderstanding CAPs and Meaningful Attention:\nWhen we describe \"patterns of attention,\" we're really describing ripples in one unified field. CAPs aren't separate policies but descriptions of how attention moves when aligned with recognition. The lists in values cards are like pointing to where water naturally flows, not directing the flow.\nHelping Others Recognize Meaning:\nInstead of guiding people to a \"state\" or teaching them \"policies,\" we might:\n\n\nHelp them notice when attention and recognition are already aligned\nPoint to moments when they felt that spark of recognition\nSupport them in trusting that natural movement\n\n\nNatural Draw:\nWhat we called \"natural draw\" might better be understood as the natural alignment that happens when presence allows attention to move with recognition. Like water finding its own level - it's not being drawn or pulled, it's finding its nature.\n\nLet me try one more diagram that might better show this unity:UntitledClick to open diagramThis simpler representation suggests:\n\nPresence as the field in which everything happens\nNo separate \"states\" or \"parts\"\nMovement/flow rather than separate elements\n\nThis might help us:\n\nKeep Edelman's practical structure (values cards, clear descriptions) while\nUnderstanding it's pointing to something unified, and\nAvoiding creating artificial separations\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nExplore how this unified understanding might refine values card creation?\nLook at specific examples of how to describe this movement without fragmenting it?\nConsider practical implications while maintaining this sense of oneness?\n\nThe key insight might be that we can use descriptive tools (like CAPs) while remembering they're just ways of pointing to movements in one unified field of presence, recognition, and attention ",
