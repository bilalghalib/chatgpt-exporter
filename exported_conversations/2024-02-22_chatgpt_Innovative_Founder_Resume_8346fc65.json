      "content": "Help me turn this into a resume worthy set of bullet points\nI wanna say that I helped come up with the learning by doing system in a cohort based facilitation for online workshops for social enterprises and that I built the first prototype software to have people take tests and get just the right learning nugget back for them. It's messy. I ran the programs, I designed the tech, I built the tech, then I taught other people to facilitate my methodology so people don't do random \"work\" when they're learning entrepreneurship, they do what they need to do. And now I need to brag about it in my resume, can you help?\nHere's what I got:\n\nBLOOM\t\t          Lebanon  \nCo-Founder and Research Development\t\t       2016-2023\n●\tPioneered cohort-based learning by doing systems and developed the early prototypes. \n●\tGrew dev and facilitation teams  team in creating custom software for learning-by-doing experiences, focusing on social entrepreneurship and post-traumatic growth. This included pioneering a unique learning system.\n●\tConducted research on applied positive psychological frameworks, which was instrumental in creating an online community-oriented startup learning environment. Also co-facilitated the online accelerator program.\n\n\nIt's hard when you're a founder, you do everything!",
