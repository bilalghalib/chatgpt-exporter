      "content": "This error is happening because Gemini CLI (or Code Assist) **requires you to set a specific environment variable** after login to complete authentication for your project.\n\n### 🛠️ Why It Fails\nEven though the login appears successful, it fails because the environment variable `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` is **not set**, and the Gemini CLI can't tell which Google Cloud project to use.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ How to Fix It\n\nYou need to set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable in your terminal. Here's how:\n\n#### 1. **Find your Google Cloud Project ID**\n- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager)\n- Copy the **Project ID** of the project you want to use\n\n#### 2. **Set the Environment Variable**\nIn your terminal, run:\n\n```bash\nexport GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id\n```\n\n_(Replace `your-project-id` with the actual Project ID you copied)_\n\nIf you're using `zsh` or `bash`, you can also make this permanent by adding it to your shell config file:\n\n```bash\necho 'export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id' >> ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 Then try logging in again\nNow re-run the Gemini CLI or Code Assist tool:\n\n```bash\ngemini login\n```\n\nOr whatever command you were using.\n\n---\n\nLet me know which tool you're using (`gemini` CLI, IDE plugin, etc.) and I can give you more specific steps.",
