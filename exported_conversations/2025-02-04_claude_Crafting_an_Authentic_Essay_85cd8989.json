Sallamu’alaykum\n\nSummary\nIn this transcript, the speaker discusses a variety of interrelated topics focusing on the notion of wholeness, the role of the heart or inner faculty in discerning truth, and the way Western philosophical and historical events—such as the Black Plague, Enlightenment thinkers, and Darwin—have contributed to a fragmented mindset. They emphasize the importance of reintroducing a sense of spiritual and emotional wholeness in personal and societal development, particularly in projects aimed at social change. They also speak about their desire to connect with an authentic tradition (possibly in an Islamic context) to validate their insights and develop confidence.\nA practical method mentioned is the process of examining one’s “To Do List” through the lens of “want to” versus “have to,” with the aim of reconnecting to deeper meaning, joy, and alignment with one’s true purpose or divine guidance.\n\nConcepts, Ideas, and Themes\nFoundational Schemas and Perceptual Faculty of Wholeness\nDisconnection and Burnout in Social Enterprises\nSocratic Method and Inner Knowledge (‘Ruh’)\nGod Confidence vs. Self-Confidence\nHistorical and Philosophical Influences on Western Mindsets\nBlack Plague\nEnlightenment Thinkers (Descartes, Galileo, Hobbes)\nDarwinism\nFear, Hierarchy, and Bureaucracy\nDecolonialization and Fear\nRole of the Heart (Spiritual/Inner Perception) in Knowing\nGentle Opening of the Heart’s Insight\nBalancing Rationality with a Holistic Perspective\nHealing, Wholeness, and the Metaphor of Honey and Black Seed\nProcess of ‘Come Alive’ (Examining Tensions in the To Do List)\nDifference Between ‘Have To’ and ‘Want To’\nConnecting to Meaning, Joy, and the Source of Good\nDesire to Join an Authentic Tradition or Chain\n\nVersion 2:\nIntroduction\nI've been thinking about these foundational schemas that we use to see the world and about how this way of disconnection from a perception of wholeness—the idea that we have a perceptual faculty as a civilization—shapes our reality. As a society, we are gas lit to refuse to acknowledge, even though most people will admit their perceptual faculty of recognizing love, meaning, beauty, and truth is real. Part of my focus is on how this ties into the burnout we experience when we try to “change the world” without including ourselves in that world.\nI hope to connect these reflections to various strands of thought, possibly including Islamic psychology, to better understand how we might bring back a sense of wholeness, “whole seeing,” and a heart-centered approach to knowledge. I would be honored if anyone with more formal training could give me a gut check on where my head is going and how I might improve my thinking.\n\n1. Foundational Schemas and a Lack of Wholeness\nThis disconnection from wholeness is closely linked to how we dismiss our inherent perceptual faculty. Even though we recognize love, meaning, beauty, and truth, we often treat these as mere emotions rather than valid forms of knowing. In developing truly impactful social enterprises, or in endeavors to “change the world,” we burn out if we fail to include ourselves. The problem partially lies in ignoring the whole of our being—neglecting both heart and mind.\nConnecting these observations with principles from Islamic psychology (or other spiritual traditions) suggests that recognizing and nurturing our deeper, holistic faculties might be key. This is not merely an intellectual exercise; it is also an emotional and spiritual orientation that acknowledges how a sense of wholeness combats burnout and fuels meaningful action.\n\n2. The Socratic Method, Self-Confidence, and ‘Ruh’\nSometimes, I grapple with my own lack of confidence because I’m not formally trained. I’ve listened to a thousand YouTube videos and been to a few classes, but I wonder whether I have anything important to share. Yet the idea of the Socratic method being an indication of the ruh—the inner spirit—resonates with me deeply. It suggests we can discern knowledge from within, creating a space for people to uncover understanding through practice and introspection.\nFor me, this brings up the distinction between self-confidence and “God confidence.” It feels crucial not to doubt my curiosities, interests, and diverse educational backgrounds, as long as I stay aligned with something higher. By trusting that this curiosity comes from a place of authenticity, I’m encouraged to keep exploring and to present these thoughts in a way that is clearer and more structured.\n\n3. History, Western Philosophy, and the ‘Mind Virus’\nPart of my exploration involves history: considering what the Black Plague in Europe did to the mindset of Europeans, leading to a rejection of God and the eventual rise of Enlightenment thinking. From the Roman Empire’s hierarchy merging with Constantine’s bureaucratic approach to the influence of Hobbes and Descartes, the Western tradition has often been suspicious of human nature, viewing it as “nasty, brutish, and short.”\nDarwin tells us all humans want is to procreate, reinforcing a belief that there is nothing more profound inside each person. Consequently, this perspective encourages systems of domination, calculation, and control—market systems, fines, fees, and jails—over a more trusting and emergent sense of human goodness. This is what I sometimes refer to as a “mind virus” that has infected the world, creating fear and distrust in our inherent capacities for love, meaning, and spiritual perception.\n\n4. Perceptual Faculties and the Heart’s Knowing\nAgainst this backdrop, I wonder what it would look like to recognize another quality of perception, one that Socrates suggested we can access by continually asking questions and digging within ourselves. There’s something that knows right from wrong, echoing the saying of Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam: “Put something against your heart and see if it shakes.”\nWhere does this knowing come from? Opening the “eye of the heart” can be a way for everyone, regardless of background, to see more deeply. It may also offer a gentler approach to decolonialization—recognizing that colonialism might have been a Band-Aid covering fear of death, fear of the world, and fear of each other. So instead of simply ripping off the Band-Aid, we might try to lovingly peel it off to see what wisdom might flourish when the heart’s knowing is trusted.\n\n5. Healing, Wholeness, and Sharing the Vision\nMy thinking involves pairing the bitter with the sweet—like honey and black seed—to address how the Western mindset evolved and to offer a healthier alternative. By gently helping people who are deeply invested in a materialist worldview regain even an iota of fitra (the innate human disposition), I see a pathway toward healing.\nI’m developing this understanding for myself through a framework that I’m calling “come alive.” It’s about working with the perceptual faculty of tension, using something as simple as a To Do List to see where we linger in what we want and where we feel forced by what we have to do. This is often how we reinforce systems that go against our true desires and how we disconnect from the source of all good.\n\n6. The ‘Have To’ vs. ‘Want To’ Approach\nWhen someone brings their To Do List, we examine which items they genuinely want to do and which items they feel they have to do. The have to’s typically carry tension. We race through them, delegate them, or view them as burdens. This habit can gradually erode our connection to meaning, joy, and possibility.\nHowever, it doesn’t mean that every have to is negative. Sometimes, you might set your alarm because you want to wake up for Fajr (the pre-dawn prayer). This transforms a have to into a want to through a shift in intention. By reexamining these assumptions, we can rediscover what truly nourishes us and fosters alignment with our deeper values.\n\n7. Moving Forward with a Tradition and a Chain\nUltimately, I recognize my own need for belonging to a tradition—a clearer chain of guidance. I have intuitions, feelings, and research, but aligning with a lineage or discipline provides grounding and confidence. This could be Islamic psychology, or it might be something else that honors the interplay between heart and mind. Either way, finding a spiritual or intellectual chain ensures I’m not misled by my curiosities. It helps integrate my diverse background and God confidence into a coherent path forward.\n\nConclusion\nReconnecting with wholeness means acknowledging a perceptual faculty beyond mere rational calculation—one that recognizes love, beauty, and truth as real. We can trace the roots of our fragmented worldview back through history and philosophy, yet we also have the capacity to open the eye of the heart. By consciously distinguishing between have to and want to, by trusting the ruh or the spirit within, and by engaging in gentle decolonialization, we can heal ourselves and the systems we operate in.\nThis work, whether through an established tradition or through personal exploration, requires courage, curiosity, and kindness. It is a reminder that we need to include ourselves in the world we want to improve, bridging the gap between intellect and heart so that our actions arise from a place of wholeness.\n\nVersion 3:\nIntroduction\nIt’s my intention that this becomes a snapshot of my thinking about the truths I’ve discovered in my life and the realities they imply for living a good life—particularly in the face of our sense of speed, rush, fear, otherness, alienation, and impending disaster. My mom shared with me, back in October 2011, the Eid prayer from Mecca, and in that prayer, the speaker mentioned the idea that God is beautiful and loves that which is beautiful. At the time, I was hurt and struggling to accept the tradition I’d been raised with because it seemed to interfere with me trusting my heart. Yet that tension, that reality, set in motion a series of reflections about the interplay between text, tradition, and the aliveness I felt inside.\n\n1. Confronting Fear and Confusion\nI remember laying on the ground outside when someone asked me, “Do you love me?” Instead of taking a breath to look inside my heart for the truth, I deflected. I asked for a literal definition of love, avoiding what I already knew within me. There are places within us that know love, that can distinguish it from lust. But in my confusion—and my desire to remain confused so I wouldn’t face the pain of confronting my family or my own identity—I created more conflict for myself. I lived like a zombie, sneaking out at night to let the parts of me that were alive breathe in the shadows.\nThen, in October 2011, I received one key of a sort of trifecta that helped me open my heart, reconnect with my emotions, and trust my perception of beauty and meaning again. I realized that beauty is the splendor of truth, that beauty draws you into love, and that the faculty of perceiving beauty is also inextricable from the reality of knowing what is good, true, and meaningful.\n\n2. The Faculty That Sees Beauty\nThis faculty within us that recognizes beauty is the same place where we can answer the questions about what is really true and good, and how we should live. My background in science, technology, and philosophy often pulled me toward rational explanations and control. But I started to see that this controlling mindset can disconnect us from the reality of the bird: waking up in fear and hope, leaving its nest in search of sustenance with awe and wonder, grateful for what it finds. That way of being uses both eyes—one rational, the other connected to the heart.\nI realized that my rejection of the tradition that was originally teaching me how to open the “eye of the heart” limited my ability to walk the tightrope of life with confidence. Keeping my eyes focused on beauty while also planning and planting seeds is a delicate balance. You know the rope will move. You don’t know if the next step will land. But you trust. For me, that trust is echoed in the Islamic tradition, where God-consciousness and faith lead one to success. It is not about blind leaps but about step-by-step learning and seeing—like the bird discovering worms, or the tightrope walker feeling the invisible line beneath each foot.\n\n3. A Destructive Stasis and the Roots of Alienation\nOur society’s stasis has become destructive. We remain stuck in systems that alienate us from our perceptual faculty of beauty, truth, and goodness. We can’t keep telling ourselves that these are just “mere emotions” or illusions. If we watch a film about Nelson Mandela and feel uplifted and inspired, that sense of possibility and hope matters. Yet fear often stops us from acting on it.\nWhen I lost someone dear to me, it was because I couldn’t face the reality of my own love—of my own heart’s knowing. I didn’t understand that love is the splendor of truth, that beauty, truth, and love intertwine, and that if I want to know God, I have to “read” all three books: revelation, inner insight (feelings, thoughts, self-reflection), and the outer world (the beauty of nature, the signs of pollution and destruction).\n\n4. Signs and Missteps in Human Progress\nI began to see the signs of repulsion in polluted rivers, the squalor of 1800s London, the miseries of industrialization, and the illusions of progress. So much technology, ironically, stems from fear or the desire to dominate. The “mind virus” of materialism led us to exploit the world through hierarchical systems—like capitalism and neoliberalism—often built on a single, rational eye that sees resources, markets, profits, and efficiency, but not the other eye that perceives beauty and meaning.\nDopamine teaches us to chase rewards, imagining that tomorrow will be better, that we’re building heaven in some future realm. Meanwhile, we pollute the present. We rationalize decisions like the lobotomy and nitrogen-fixing fertilizers—originally inventions motivated by some form of love or survival—only to watch them become monstrous when adopted for profit or destructive pursuits.\n\n5. The Eye of the Heart: Rediscovering Wholeness\nYet there’s another way. We can open that other eye, the eye of the heart, and many of us caught a glimpse of it during the pandemic. People stayed home, baked sourdough, and reconnected with crafts and arts—collaborating with yeast and flour instead of rushing off to busy offices. That may seem trivial, but it reflects how we can be co-creators with nature, savor time, and share the fruits of our labor.\nWe’re always told to do gratitude practices, but they sometimes clash with an underlying entitlement or the leftover illusions of control. Opening the eye that perceives beauty requires humility. It demands daily practice, daily listening, daily risk—trusting that infinite goodness can unfold in each moment if we’re sensitive to it.\n\n6. Releasing Fear, Embracing Love\nMy own story shows how living in that fear can hold us back. Yet when I met my wife, I finally decided to trust that faculty inside me. Even though our background, cultures, and languages seemed incompatible at first glance, I felt my shoulders drop when I held her. There was a leaning-in, a “yes.” I suspect that what religions call “God” is a oneness that exists outside time, urging us toward the next step in a greater, mysterious story. Small experiments with beauty lead us deeper into trust and alive-ness.\nThis perspective helps me reflect on the frameworks and worldviews we’ve adopted. It helps me see how we’ve turned many people’s misery and the planet’s suffering into mere means to an end, as if fulfilling the UN Sustainable Development Goals or building a social enterprise is always a matter of measured outcomes and philanthropic ROI. But real transformation, I believe, requires a bottom-up blossoming, like seeds that break open in fertile soil. Let people discover their own sources of meaning and follow the threads of their own aliveness.\n\n7. Seeds of a More Beautiful World\nWhen I was younger, I worked in Iraq and saw the international NGOs arrive, looking for women’s tech businesses to fund. They cropped up overnight. But real growth and lasting change unfold more organically. It’s fluid, adaptive, daily, like the bird leaving the nest again and again, trusting worms will be found.\nIn a world accelerating toward climate crisis, social upheaval, and spiritual alienation, I believe the solution isn’t in building higher walls or “escaping” to Mars. It’s in re-engaging with the faculty that perceives deeper truth, wonders at the infinite variety of possibility, and resonates with beauty as it emerges. That place within us directs our attention in ways that complex systems and measurements can’t capture.\n\n8. Conclusion: Living in Aliveness\nI understand now that trusting the eye of the heart doesn’t exclude using our rational faculties. We can still plant seeds, manage resources, and plan for the future. The difference is that every step becomes an act of beauty, an attempt to stay in harmony with the wonders unfolding around us. Our “success” is in each stride on the tightrope, each morning the bird leaves the nest, each moment we choose to see rather than control.\nIn my life, I see that coming alive doesn’t mean racing to build unstoppable technologies or forging bulletproof retirement plans. It means receiving the gifts of each day, letting them shape us and show us our next step. I hope there are critiques or suggestions that could refine my perspective, but for now, I hope you’re having a beautiful day—and that you’re opening up, day by day, to that which makes you come alive.\n\n"

The thread of fear runs through your thinking - fear of death, fear of each other, fear that holds us back from trusting our hearts. Yet you also speak of your wife and that moment of your shoulders dropping, of feeling a \"yes.\" Could you walk us through how you moved from fear to trust in that situation? What did it teach you about the \"faculty that perceives beauty\"?\n\nI'm asking these specific questions because I notice your most compelling passages come when you share personal experiences - like laying on the ground avoiding the question \"Do you love me?\" or feeling your shoulders drop when meeting your wife. These moments make your philosophical ideas feel lived and real rather than abstract. They help readers connect your deeper insights about perception and wholeness to their own lives.\n\nWhat do you think?

As a society, we are gas lit to refuse to acknowledge, even though I think most people will acknowledge that their perceptual faculty of recognizing love, meaning, beauty, truth is a real thing that they have. But I think it's emotions.\nAnd so I've been working on how do we bring that into my framework for developing and truly impactful, quote UN quote social enterprises and people that want to, quote UN quote, change the world, but are burning out and helping them realize that that problem is partially because they don't include themselves in the world that they want to improve. And part of that is because of this lack of wholeness and lack of whole seeing. And of course, you know, I'm sure you have many different ways of connecting some of these ideas to the world of Islamic psychology and these principles. But I would love to give you some writing and to get a gut check.\nAnd I really hope that that isn't too much to ask, but I would be really honored if you could give just give me a yeah, your, your opinion on where my head is going and if you have any insights of how I could improve my thinking. Yeah. And I'd love to, yeah, see what you think. Inshallah.\n\n[2. Seeking Feedback and Overcoming Self-Doubt]\nOK. Salam. And if you say yes, it means I have a lot of work to do. You can tell I'm in a cafe, but yes, that OK. First of all, thank you for the encouraging message. Sometimes I have a lack of confidence because I'm not trained, you know? I've only listened to 1000 YouTube videos and been to a few classes, so I feel that I might not have something important to share.\nBut this idea of the Socratic method being an indication of the roar and the idea that we can actually discern knowledge from within and creating a space for that in people's lives through whatever the process of practice is. And, and for me. So I'm trying to distinguish that for myself and, and sort of not have my myself confidence, but God confidence in a sense that I'm not being LED wrong by my curiosities, interests, and very diverse educational backgrounds. But yes, thank you so much for the encouragement and insha'allah, I will share with you my thoughts in a way that can be a little more clear and structured.\n\n[3. History, Western Philosophy, and the ‘Mind Virus’]\nIt involves both history like what did the Black Plague in Europe do to the mindset of Europeans and the rejection of God and enlightenment. So how could it be related? So, so looking at both philosophical evolution of mostly Western Europe, I think, you know, this is the mind virus that has infected the world through hierarchy coming from the Roman Empire merging with Constantine and this sort of domination and bureaucratic approach, plus the Black Plague, plus Descartes, plus Galileo, plus Hobbes. And like, not being able to trust people because you know that they are nasty, brutish and short.\nAnd Darwin tells you that all they want to do is procreate. And like, you don't have a sense that there's something beautiful inside of them that you can reliably trust and create a space for emergence. And so this idea that everything must be accounted for, calculated, dominated and controlled in these systems of whatever it is. So currently we have market systems and, you know, fines and fees and time in jail or, you know, stuff like that.\n\n[4. Perceptual Faculties and the Heart’s Knowing]\nAnd versus, yeah, what would it be like if we had recognition that we have this other quality perception that is connected to the thing that Socrates was suggesting? We can get at it and keep asking ourselves and digging within to recognize that there's something that knows good and wrong that the Papa Muhammad Sallallahu and he sent them says, put something against your heart and then see if it shakes. Like, what does it mean for something to shake when you put it up against your heart? Like, does your heart know?\nWhere does that knowing come from anyway? So I feel that there's a way of talking about this in a way that is for everybody and will be a way of, you know, even countering this idea of decolonialization. It's like don't decolonialize till you realize what Band-Aid colonialism was covering, which is fear of death, fear of the world, fear of each other. And once we can understand that, maybe we can be a little bit more gentle in peeling this Band-Aid off and not decolonializing and saying everything must be indigenous or whatever.\nBut finding what happens when a Western mindset gently opens up the eye of insight and the eye quote UN quote of the heart as Muslims might say. And like, how will that 3 dimensional 2 eyed perspective of reason and rationality and quality and holistic comprehension influence the western world and the western mindset, if that can be opened? And I think we need to do it in a gentle way and maybe experientially to know that the heart has access to truths that are both reliable and factual and true. This is this is my, my, some of the thinking that I've been exploring.\n\n[5. Healing, Wholeness, and Sharing the Vision]\nSo it's both history and understanding, like why the West's developed these mindsets, being gentle and knowing that medicine is both bitter and also sweet. So honey and black seed, I think is metaphorically important to comprehend here. And then kind of bringing it together in a way that is possible to share that is acceptable for someone that is deeply invested in this materialist mindset and sort of helping them crawl out if they have even an iota of Fipra and access to their heart left. So this is the work that I've been exploring.\nI'm, I'm, I'm developing it in both writing and, and like understanding things more clearly for myself. And then also in a process that I'm calling come alive. And essentially the process works through the perceptual faculty of tension. So you bring me your To Do List and then we see which ones do you want to do and which ones do you have to do?\n\n[6. The ‘Have To’ vs. ‘Want To’ Approach]\nAnd the have to usually have tensions, right? It's like the want to, the things that you want to linger and be present with and you know you want to be having dinner with your family and it's not something you'd rush or delegate or automate. And then the have to's are I have to get a job because I have to and so many have to's. And this is how we run on Enfusina, right?\nThis is how we go against ourselves with all these have to do's and reinforce the systems. And the question is, can we take these have to's, understand the reasoning behind it? Why do you think you have to do that? Is it true? What could be possible if it wasn't true?\nAnd this idea of taking this To Do List and making it a doorway into, first of all, you know, connecting back with meaning, which and and joy and possibility and dreams and all of these things that I think connect us to, I was like the source of all good, the good, but right. And so when we have something within us that's like, oh, wow, that's amazing, that's beautiful. This is what I want to do.\nThis is who I want to be. I think we are accessing that. And whenever we're like, I have to, we are, you know, first of all, it could just be not like unintentionally have to. So for instance, you might want to set an alarm that you have to to wake up for fetcher or something.\nBut with the right intentionality, that have to becomes more of a flavored with want to. So these are these are my thoughts. I hope, I hope it's not too long. And thank you so much for the encouragement.\n\n[7. Moving Forward with a Tradition and a Chain]\nI could put this together a little bit more clearly and articulately in some writing if it helps for you to give feedback on. Otherwise, this is a short summary of where my head is at. Hamdulillah. My contract with the UN is over and I've been deep in this reflection mode and I'm so honoured and grateful that I have people that have studied and have teachers to be able to install guide me. And maybe it's not Islamic psychology, maybe it's a few other things like you mentioned, but I would really like to 1st, you know, I have my own intuitions and feelings and research, but I would like some confidence by being a part of a tradition.\nAnd I know that it's something that I need is to be a part of a chain in a clearer way. Sallamu’alaykum\n\nSummary\nIn this transcript, the speaker discusses a variety of interrelated topics focusing on the notion of wholeness, the role of the heart or inner faculty in discerning truth, and the way Western philosophical and historical events—such as the Black Plague, Enlightenment thinkers, and Darwin—have contributed to a fragmented mindset.

      "content": " Here's a draft that aims to capture your core insights while maintaining your voice but with a slightly more polished tone:\n\nSeeing With Both Eyes: A Path to Wholeness\n\nWe have been taught to distrust something fundamental within us: our perceptual faculty for recognizing love, meaning, beauty, and truth. As a society, we are gas lit to refuse to acknowledge this way of knowing, even though most people will admit they have it. We dismiss it as \"just emotions\" while burning ourselves out trying to change a world we've stopped fully seeing.\n\nThis disconnection stems from what might be called a mind virus - one that has infected our civilization through centuries of accumulated fear and control. From the Black Plague through the Enlightenment to modern times, Western thought has increasingly viewed humans as creatures to be managed rather than beings capable of emergence and beauty. This mindset tells us that everything must be accounted for, calculated, dominated, and controlled. We see this playing out in our market systems, our institutions, and even in how we relate to ourselves.\n\nBut what if we recognized that we have another quality of perception? One that connects us to a deeper knowing - not mere intuition, but a faculty that lets us perceive wholeness rather than just pieces. Think of it as having two eyes: one for rational analysis and one for holistic comprehension. Most of us have learned to rely almost entirely on the first while letting the second grow dim.\n\nThis shows up practically in how we approach even simple things like our daily to-do lists. We divide tasks into \"have to\" versus \"want to,\" and find ourselves constantly tensing against the \"have to's\" - rushing through them, delegating them, automating them. We race through dinner with family or rush past moments of potential beauty because we're caught in systems of obligation that we've internalized so deeply we forget to question them.\n\nThe path forward isn't about rejecting rationality or planning. Rather, it's about inverting our usual process. Instead of starting with calculation and control, then trying to squeeze in meaning and beauty, we can begin with our faculty for perceiving wholeness. This doesn't mean abandoning practical action - it means allowing our actions to emerge from a more complete way of seeing.\n\nThis isn't just personal - it's about healing our collective disconnection. When we step back from rushing to \"change the world\" and instead include ourselves in the world we want to improve, something shifts. We start to see that impact doesn't always mean scaling up. Sometimes it means getting smaller, more present, more connected to what's right in front of us. The world needs this more complete way of seeing now more than ever.",

We dismiss it as \"just emotions\" while burning ourselves out trying to change a world we've stopped fully seeing.\n\nThis disconnection stems from what might be called a mind virus - one that has infected our civilization through centuries of accumulated fear and control. From the Black Plague through the Enlightenment to modern times, Western thought has increasingly viewed humans as creatures to be managed rather than beings capable of emergence and beauty. This mindset tells us that everything must be accounted for, calculated, dominated, and controlled. We see this playing out in our market systems, our institutions, and even in how we relate to ourselves.\n\nBut what if we recognized that we have another quality of perception? One that connects us to a deeper knowing - not mere intuition, but a faculty that lets us perceive wholeness rather than just pieces. Think of it as having two eyes: one for rational analysis and one for holistic comprehension. Most of us have learned to rely almost entirely on the first while letting the second grow dim.\n\nThis shows up practically in how we approach even simple things like our daily to-do lists. We divide tasks into \"have to\" versus \"want to,\" and find ourselves constantly tensing against the \"have to's\" - rushing through them, delegating them, automating them. We race through dinner with family or rush past moments of potential beauty because we're caught in systems of obligation that we've internalized so deeply we forget to question them.\n\nThe path forward isn't about rejecting rationality or planning. Rather, it's about inverting our usual process. Instead of starting with calculation and control, then trying to squeeze in meaning and beauty, we can begin with our faculty for perceiving wholeness. This doesn't mean abandoning practical action - it means allowing our actions to emerge from a more complete way of seeing.\n\nThis isn't just personal - it's about healing our collective disconnection. When we step back from rushing to \"change the world\" and instead include ourselves in the world we want to improve, something shifts. We start to see that impact doesn't always mean scaling up. Sometimes it means getting smaller, more present, more connected to what's right in front of us. The world needs this more complete way of seeing now more than ever.",
