If you want we could remove this project completely from this agreement.\n[i]@saadaghalib@gmail.com - @falahmus52@gmail.com is suggesting we only add one additional engineer consultant alongside you and Steve to respond to the construction team and to be the liason and help with the oversight with the Design consultancy that will be hired. \n\n\nMakes sense?\n_Assigned to saadaghalib@gmail.com_\n[j]Again WET needs to provide one in addition to Saad & Steve the rest to be provided by the overall design consultant\n[k]Indeed, is there any edit to this that will clarify that? I will give it an attempt\n[l]Agree, Those are the core people during for work on the project. However checking the design need other PART TIME disciplines listed. This is very important to assure the design is checked and there is no issues with the design. Full time construction oversight engineer is needed during construction with part time support from other disciplns.  I thought this was clear in the text that Bilal and I sent, if not please add any clarifications to it.\n[m]@falahmus52@gmail.com - we've highlighted the updated elements here in yellow :)\n[n]From Falah, a question: \"to be decided as per the client payments (What if the client deducts retention money or any other deductions then needs to be taken into consideration\" - answered by revised 2.A.4\n[o]Original text: Profit sharing will start to be paid upon achieving positive cash flow during the progress of the design and construction phases and in accordance with the payment schedule by the project beneficiary.\n[p]Falah's comment: (to be removed because the design and engineering will be done by outsiders under WET’s responsibility.\n[q]@falahmus52@gmail.com the idea is that WET's responsibility to manage the outsiders is where the overhead costs are going to be deployed.\n[r]@falahmus52@gmail.com please keep the language consistent - JV means party two correct? It's been confusing to include the new terminology. Why use the word JV instead of party two, is there a reason?\n[s]Falah's comment:\nthis contract to be done by the JV\n[t]This makes sense to me, @saadaghalib@gmail.com what do you think? Do we have a joint venture responsibility section that makes sense for us to move this into?\n[u]Falah's comments: (no need the design team will get a fee which will cover all expenses)\n[v]I expect this goes through the standard budgeting process. Makes sense then to me.\n[w]Falah's comment: (To be removed)\n[x]It's not critical and can be removed although it is mentioned in point four above, we can keep this repeated here as well since it reinforces and makes clear the inclusion of insurance / accomodation costs as well.\n[y]Original Text: The costs of the construction oversight engineering team and expenses will be paid at actual cost plus 15% to cover Party 2’s overhead costs.\n[z]Falah's notes: (to be removed as it is a joint work)\n[aa]Falah's notes: (to be removed)\n[ab]Notes from Falah:\nThis should be the opposite way around the first party is responsible for the construction program and budget and Party 2 to review and approve within one week.\n[ac]Notes from Falah:\nThis should be the opposite way around the first party is responsible for the construction program and budget and Party 2 to review and approve within one week.\n[ad]Updated liability clause to indicate our work as a team.\n[ae]@falahmus52@gmail.com here's an updated liability clause based on our last conversations, please review and let us know your thoughts.\n\nversion 2: \nTable Of Contents:\nBACKGROUND:\n1.

      "content": "To compare the role and ownership of Party 2 over the design process in the two documents, I will focus on how each document outlines Party 2's responsibilities, authority, and rights in relation to the design process. This involves examining aspects such as decision-making power, scope of design responsibilities, intellectual property rights, and any clauses that might enhance or limit Party 2's position. \n\nAfter reviewing the two documents, here's the comparison:\n\n1. **Design Process Authority and Responsibilities**:\n   - **Document 1**: Party 2 is responsible for offering the use of its patented technology, providing concept/preliminary designs, and overseeing the design process, including final engineering designs. They also have a significant role in selecting and negotiating contracts with design consultants.\n   - **Document 2**: Similar responsibilities are outlined for Party 2, including offering patented technology and overseeing the design process. Additionally, there's emphasis on Party 2's role in consulting, selecting, and negotiating with the design consultancy in coordination with Party 1.\n\n2. **Intellectual Property Rights**:\n   - **Document 1**: Specifies licensing payments for the use of Party 2's intellectual property, indicating a strong ownership position over the patented technology.\n   - **Document 2**: Similar to Document 1 in terms of intellectual property rights but includes more details on the coverage of licensing fees, which could imply a stronger stance for Party 2 in protecting its IP rights.\n\n3. **Decision-Making in Design**:\n   - **Document 1**: Party 2 is responsible for key decisions in the design phase, including research, selection of a consulting company, and QA/QC staff.\n   - **Document 2**: Similar to Document 1, but with an added emphasis on the coordination and help of Party 1 in these processes.\n\n4. **Approval of Design Changes and Submittals**:\n   - **Document 1**: Party 2 is responsible for the approval of submittals, including changes to the original design.\n   - **Document 2**: This responsibility is also present, reiterating Party 2’s authority in the design process.\n\nBased on these points, let's assess which document puts Party 2 in a better position:\n\n- **Authority and Responsibilities**: Both documents place Party 2 in a strong position regarding the design process, with substantial responsibilities and decision-making power.\n- **Intellectual Property Rights**: Document 2 might edge out slightly due to its more detailed coverage of licensing fees and specific conditions, reinforcing Party 2's control over its IP.\n- **Decision-Making and Coordination**: While both documents are similar, Document 2 emphasizes coordination with Party 1, which could be seen as a more collaborative approach, possibly reducing unilateral control by Party 2 but potentially leading to more harmonious project progression.\n- **Design Changes Approval**: Both documents give Party 2 significant authority over design changes.\n\nIn summary, both documents position Party 2 strongly in terms of design process ownership and authority. Document 1 provides a clear-cut authority to Party 2, while Document 2 adds more details, especially in the aspect of intellectual property rights, and emphasizes collaboration with Party 1. The choice of which document is better for Party 2 might depend on whether Party 2 prefers more unilateral control (leaning towards Document 1) or detailed protection of IP rights and collaborative decision-making (leaning towards Document 2).",

Any engagement in subsequent phases, including operation and maintenance, requires a separate agreement or addendum to this contract.\"\n\n2. **Either 15% Overhead or 20% Profit Sharing**:\n   - **Rationale**: This provides a choice between a fixed overhead rate or a potentially variable profit sharing percentage, giving flexibility and risk-sharing options.\n   - **Integration in Document Two**: Frame this as a mutually beneficial choice, allowing Party 1 to opt for a predictable cost (overhead) or a share in the success of the project (profit sharing).

Here's a professional and concise email that incorporates your points:\n\n---\n\nSubject: Review and Integration of Contract Modifications – Further Discussion Needed\n\nDear Team,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. Given the time, I propose we postpone our meeting to a later date. Dr. Saad and I have carefully reviewed the recent comments and proposed modifications to the contract. We've prepared our responses and criteria for integration into Document Two and would like to share these with you for your consideration.\n\n1. **Contract Ends at Construction Completion**: We suggest clarifying that the contract concludes at the end of the construction phase. This would necessitate a new contract or addendum for any subsequent operations or maintenance work. This approach will help maintain clear boundaries and focused responsibilities.\n\n2. **Choice of Overhead or Profit Sharing**: To balance financial predictability and shared success, we propose an option for Party 2 to receive either a 15% overhead on direct costs or a 20% share in the net profits. This choice offers flexibility and aligns financial planning with the project's outcomes.\n\n3. **License Fees Exclusion from WET’s Operating Budget**: We recommend explicitly stating that license fees for Party 2's technology are separate from WET's operating budget. These fees are solely for the usage license and should not be allocated to other expenses, including personnel payments.\n\n4. **Design Contract Responsibility of Party Two**: To ensure independent quality assurance, the design contract and process should be the sole responsibility of Party 2. Party 1 will retain standard oversight, including access to design budgets and accounts, and participation in decision-making as detailed in the Agreement.\n\nWe believe these suggestions will benefit both parties, ensuring clarity, transparency, and a solid foundation for our project's success. Your review and incorporation of these points would be greatly appreciated. Let's aim to reconvene when everyone is available to discuss these in more detail. Unfortunately, I won't be available later tonight for further discussions.\n\nLooking forward to your feedback and to our continued collaboration.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",

It’s getting late today for a meeting, I propose we postpone our meeting till we align on the criteria outlined in this email. Dr. Saad and I have carefully reviewed the recent comments and proposed modifications to the contract. We've prepared our responses and criteria based on the document Falah and Nova created and would like to share these with you for your consideration before we meet again: \n\t•\tContract Ends at Construction Completion: We suggest clarifying that the contract concludes at the end of the construction phase. This would necessitate a new contract or addendum for any subsequent operations or maintenance work. This approach will help maintain clear boundaries and focused responsibilities.\n\t•\tThe choice between Overhead or Profit Sharing: We propose for Party 2 to receive either a 15% overhead or a 20% share in the net profits, as opposed to 18%. \n\t•\tLicense Fees Exclusion from WET’s Operating Budget: We recommend explicitly stating that license fees for Party 2's technology are separate from WET's operating budget. These fees are solely for the usage license and should not be allocated to other expenses, including personnel payments - Mr. Steve, for example.\n\t•\tDesign Contract is the Responsibility of Party Two: To ensure independent quality assurance, the design contract and process should be the sole responsibility of Party 2. Party 1 will retain standard oversight, including access to design budgets and accounts, and participation in decision-making as detailed in the Agreement.\n\t•\tPayment Clarification: Need to clearly specify the meaning behind the language recently included in the contract which is as follows: \"ANY PAYMENTS BY FIRST PARTY OR JV ARE COSTS THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF COSTS OF THE PROJECT\". It’s not clear enough.\nLastly, please let us remain consistent in either using Party 1 and party 2, the recent inclusion of the “JV” language has included a concept for a third entity and is causing confusion. \nWe believe these suggestions will benefit both parties, ensuring clarity, transparency, and a solid foundation for our project's success. Please review the points above with Nova before we reconvene so we have a “head start” discussion before we meet again. These points are important to WET and we appreciate your understanding.\nLooking forward to the next meeting and our continued collaboration.\n\nResponse: Dear Bilal / Dr Saad \n\nPlease find our response to the your comments on the final revised agreement (highlighted) :\n\nWe hope that this will be the final amendment, now we can fix a mutually convenient meeting for the reading and approval of this final copy. \n\nRegards\n\nFalah \n\nI hope this email finds you well. It’s getting late today for a meeting, I propose we postpone our meeting till we align on the criteria outlined in this email. Dr. Saad and I have carefully reviewed the recent comments and proposed modifications to the contract. We've prepared our responses and criteria based on the document Falah and Nova created and would like to share these with you for your consideration before we meet again: \n\t•\tContract Ends at Construction Completion: We suggest clarifying that the contract concludes at the end of the construction phase. This would necessitate a new contract or addendum for any subsequent operations or maintenance work. This approach will help maintain clear boundaries and focused responsibilities.\n               The contract will not end at the end of the construction period but will end at the end of O&M period, since our contract with the client includes O&M period, therefore \n                 we are all jointly liable during that period (such as retention money payment,  etc) and any other client requirements that appears during O&M period.\n                \n\t•\tThe choice between Overhead or Profit Sharing: We propose for Party 2 to receive either a 15% overhead or a 20% share in the net profits, as opposed to 18%. \n                This has been discussed and covered because the in-depth analysis of the design of the double cylinder treatment plant in medical city project showed that a lot of effort and\n                  expenditure is needed much more than expected, to test and complete the detailed design and construction related unexpected costs,  in addition to the relatively high patent\n                  cost of 3 million USD which is demanded by WET. Therefore, we believe that WET share of 3 million (for patent) plus 18% of the net profit is enough for an unmature and un\n                    tested patent. \n                 However, for all the above reasons and as a show of good will, the first party is ready to pay a lump sum fee of 50,000 USD to WET in addition to the patent fee and share.\n\n\t•\tLicense Fees Exclusion from WET’s Operating Budget: We recommend explicitly stating that license fees for Party 2's technology are separate from WET's operating budget. These fees are solely for the usage license and should not be allocated to other expenses, including personnel payments - Mr. Steve, for example.\n               According to the revised agreement there is no separate operating budget for WET as all design related expenses shall be covered by the first party. We also need to emphasize                    that we realize that your partnership with Steve Willaims is essential for the justification of the patent fees and WET share in the project.  \n  \n\t•\tDesign Contract is the Responsibility of Party Two: To ensure independent quality assurance, the design contract and process should be the sole responsibility of Party 2. Party 1 will retain standard oversight, including access to design budgets and accounts, and participation in decision-making as detailed in the Agreement.\n              Agreed no Problem.  \n \n\t•\tPayment Clarification: Need to clearly specify the meaning behind the language recently included in the contract which is as follows: \"ANY PAYMENTS BY FIRST PARTY OR JV ARE COSTS THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF COSTS OF THE PROJECT\". It’s not clear enough.\n              We will remove the term JV from the agreement.  We agree that all expenses on the project are the responsibility of the first party which are part of the project cost. \n \nLastly, please let us remain consistent in either using Party 1 and party 2, the recent inclusion of the “JV” language has included a concept for a third entity and is causing confusion. \n    We agreed to remove the term JV. \n \nWe believe these suggestions will benefit both parties, ensuring clarity, transparency, and a solid foundation for our project's success. Please review the points above with Nova before we reconvene so we have a “head start” discussion before we meet again. These points are important to WET and we appreciate your understanding.\n\n   Finally,  \n\nWhat important information is in their response, think step by step what party one finds important based on party ones first email and make a summary of the key takeaways \n\n",

      "content": "Certainly! Here's a summary of the key takeaways from Party One's response, presented in a positive and constructive tone:\n\n1. **Contract Duration**:\n   - Party One clarifies that the contract will extend beyond the construction phase to include the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) period. This is due to joint liabilities and client requirements during the O&M phase.\n\n2. **Profit Sharing and Overhead**:\n   - Party One acknowledges the proposal for either 15% overhead or 20% profit sharing. However, they highlight that the design and construction of the double cylinder treatment plant require more effort and expenditure than anticipated. Considering the high patent cost demanded by WET, they suggest that WET’s share of 3 million USD for the patent plus 18% net profit is sufficient. Additionally, as a goodwill gesture, they offer to pay WET a lump sum of 50,000 USD in addition to the patent fee and profit share.\n\n3. **License Fees and Operating Budget**:\n   - Party One agrees to the separation of license fees from WET's operating budget. They also recognize the importance of the partnership with Steve Williams in justifying patent fees and WET’s share in the project.\n\n4. **Design Contract Responsibility**:\n   - They agree that Party Two (WET) will be responsible for the design contract, ensuring independent quality assurance. Party One will retain standard oversight rights, including access to design budgets and accounts.\n\n5. **Payment Clarification and JV Terminology**:\n   - Party One agrees to remove the term \"JV\" from the agreement for clarity. They confirm that all project expenses are the responsibility of Party One and are part of the project cost.\n\n6. **Consistency in Terminology**:\n   - They acknowledge the confusion caused by the inclusion of \"JV\" and agree to maintain consistency in using \"Party 1\" and \"Party 2\".\n\nParty One's response shows a willingness to clarify contract terms and address concerns raised by WET. They display an understanding of the complexities involved in the project and express a commitment to reaching an agreement that benefits both parties. Their response sets the stage for a constructive discussion in the next meeting.",

      "content": "Certainly! Let's delve into more detail regarding the payment clarification and contract duration aspects, incorporating Party One's original language and context:\n\n1. **Contract Duration**:\n   - **Party Two's Proposal**: The contract should conclude at the end of the construction phase, with any further involvement in operations or maintenance requiring a new contract or addendum.\n   - **Party One's Response**: \"The contract will not end at the end of the construction period but will end at the end of O&M period, since our contract with the client includes O&M period, therefore we are all jointly liable during that period (such as retention money payment, etc) and any other client requirements that appears during O&M period.\"\n\n2. **Payment Clarification**:\n   - **Party Two's Proposal**: Seeking clear specification of the meaning behind \"ANY PAYMENTS BY FIRST PARTY OR JV ARE COSTS THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF COSTS OF THE PROJECT\".\n   - **Party One's Response**: \"We will remove the term JV from the agreement. We agree that all expenses on the project are the responsibility of the first party which are part of the project cost.\"\n\nFrom Party One's response, it's clear they view the contract's duration as extending into the O&M period, aligning with client requirements and shared liabilities. For payment clarification, they agree to remove any ambiguity by deleting the term \"JV\" and affirming that all project expenses fall under the responsibility of Party One. This approach aims to streamline the contract's language and responsibilities.",

      "content": "ok, here's an upate on the response:\n\nhere's their original email:\nDear Bilal / Dr Saad \n\nPlease find our response to the your comments on the final revised agreement (highlighted) :\n\nWe hope that this will be the final amendment, now we can fix a mutually convenient meeting for the reading and approval of this final copy. \n\nRegards\n\nFalah \n\nI hope this email finds you well. It’s getting late today for a meeting, I propose we postpone our meeting till we align on the criteria outlined in this email. Dr. Saad and I have carefully reviewed the recent comments and proposed modifications to the contract. We've prepared our responses and criteria based on the document Falah and Nova created and would like to share these with you for your consideration before we meet again: \n\nContract Ends at Construction Completion: We suggest clarifying that the contract concludes at the end of the construction phase. This would necessitate a new contract or addendum for any subsequent operations or maintenance work. This approach will help maintain clear boundaries and focused responsibilities.\n\n               The contract will not end at the end of the construction period but will end at the end of O&M period, since our contract with the client includes O&M period, therefore \n                 we are all jointly liable during that period (such as retention money payment,  etc) and any other client requirements that appears during O&M period.\n                \nThe choice between Overhead or Profit Sharing: We propose for Party 2 to receive either a 15% overhead or a 20% share in the net profits, as opposed to 18%. \n\n                This has been discussed and covered because the in-depth analysis of the design of the double cylinder treatment plant in medical city project showed that a lot of effort and\n                  expenditure is needed much more than expected, to test and complete the detailed design and construction related unexpected costs,  in addition to the relatively high patent\n                  cost of 3 million USD which is demanded by WET. Therefore, we believe that WET share of 3 million (for patent) plus 18% of the net profit is enough for an unmature and un\n                    tested patent. \n                 However, for all the above reasons and as a show of good will, the first party is ready to pay a lump sum fee of 50,000 USD to WET in addition to the patent fee and share.\n\nLicense Fees Exclusion from WET’s Operating Budget: We recommend explicitly stating that license fees for Party 2's technology are separate from WET's operating budget. These fees are solely for the usage license and should not be allocated to other expenses, including personnel payments - Mr. Steve, for example.\n\n               According to the revised agreement there is no separate operating budget for WET as all design related expenses shall be covered by the first party. We also need to emphasize                    that we realize that your partnership with Steve Willaims is essential for the justification of the patent fees and WET share in the project.  \n  \nDesign Contract is the Responsibility of Party Two: To ensure independent quality assurance, the design contract and process should be the sole responsibility of Party 2. Party 1 will retain standard oversight, including access to design budgets and accounts, and participation in decision-making as detailed in the Agreement.\n\n              Agreed no Problem.  \n \nPayment Clarification: Need to clearly specify the meaning behind the language recently included in the contract which is as follows: \"ANY PAYMENTS BY FIRST PARTY OR JV ARE COSTS THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF COSTS OF THE PROJECT\". It’s not clear enough.\n\n              We will remove the term JV from the agreement.  We agree that all expenses on the project are the responsibility of the first party which are part of the project cost. \n \nLastly, please let us remain consistent in either using Party 1 and party 2, the recent inclusion of the “JV” language has included a concept for a third entity and is causing confusion. \n\n    We agreed to remove the term JV. \n\n \nWe believe these suggestions will benefit both parties, ensuring clarity, transparency, and a solid foundation for our project's success. Please review the points above with Nova before we reconvene so we have a “head start” discussion before we meet again. These points are important to WET and we appreciate your understanding.\n\n\n\n\nHere's our text:\nOkay, okay, so we are giving a response to Falaah, and we'd like to say that we are a team, that we're working together, and that during the O and M period, we will likely not have an active role, although we will still be liable and happy to take part in any important decisions to make sure that the project is successful. As for the profit sharing, we want to suggest that it's very generous to suggest $50,000, and it appears that you are trying to approach the required costs of overhead, which include project-related expenses that we don't need to necessarily itemize. And so rather than the $50,000, we did a quick estimate where we identified the maximum potential overhead to be around $225,000, and so as a sign of goodwill on our part, we are going to cap the 15% overhead at $150,000 over the course of eight years. And this way, it's not as scary. 15% of what? It could be very high. So understanding your perspective about why you don't want a 15% of a variable in the contract, we're recommending a $150,000 cap. Now, Steve Williams, it seems like there is a point of contention here, and so we do not necessarily need to work with Steve Williams, and we will discuss with him shortly to remove him from the design team if this is being a problem, and we will hire an alternative designer to help us with this role. And thank you so much for understanding the importance of the WET team supporting and managing the design contract. It is of utmost importance to be sure that the project is successful, and we are looking forward to our further collaboration.\n\nAm i missing responding to anything important based on their input?",

This shows a cooperative stance.\n\n2. **Profit Sharing and Overhead Costs**:\n   - Party One mentions a $50,000 lump sum as a goodwill gesture, in addition to the patent fee and profit share.\n   - Your Response: You propose capping the 15% overhead at $150,000 over eight years, which is a strategic counteroffer. This addresses their concern about variable overhead costs.\n\n3. **License Fees and Operating Budget**:\n   - Party One agrees that WET's license fees are separate from the operating budget and acknowledges the partnership with Steve Williams.\n   - Your Response: You suggest removing Steve Williams from the design team if it's a point of contention, showing flexibility. However, ensure that this does not compromise the quality or the integrity of the design process.\n\n4. **Design Contract Responsibility**:\n   - Party One agrees with Party Two's responsibility for the design contract.\n   - Your Response: You express gratitude for understanding the importance of WET managing the design contract, which reinforces your commitment to the project's success.\n\n5. **Payment Clarification and JV Term**:\n   - Party One agrees to remove the term \"JV\" and confirms that all project expenses fall on Party One.\n   - Your Response: This point seems to be adequately addressed by Party One and doesn't require further response.\n\n6. **Consistency in Terminology**:\n   - Party One agrees to the consistent use of \"Party 1\" and \"Party 2\" instead of \"JV.\"\n   - Your Response: This point is also satisfactorily addressed by Party One and doesn't necessitate additional response.\n\nOverall, your response covers the essential aspects of Party One’s email. It shows a collaborative approach, a willingness to compromise, and an understanding of the project's financial aspects. However, it’s important to ensure that any changes, especially those involving key personnel like Steve Williams, do not negatively impact the project's quality or your company's interests. Additionally, reiterating the importance of clear communication and mutual decision-making in the O&M phase can further strengthen the cooperative spirit of the agreement.",

And thank you so much for understanding the importance of the WET team supporting and managing the design contract. It is of utmost importance to be sure that the project is successful, and we are looking forward to our further collaboration.\n",

      "content": "Certainly! It seems that Party One's mention of there being \"no separate operating budget for WET\" implies that all design-related expenses, presumably including those related to licensing fees, will be covered by Party One. They also recognize the significance of your partnership with Steve Williams in justifying the patent fees and WET's share in the project. \n\nHere are a few ideas to address this in your response:\n\n1. **Clarify the Role of Steve Williams**: If Steve's involvement is crucial for justifying patent fees, you might consider keeping him but in a more limited or advisory role. This could maintain his contribution to patent justification without causing contention.\n\n2. **Propose a Detailed Breakdown of Design-Related Expenses**: To align with their statement about covering design-related expenses, you might offer a clear breakdown of what these expenses entail, ensuring transparency and mutual understanding.\n\n3. **Discuss the Implication of \"No Separate Operating Budget for WET\"**: Seek clarity on what this means for WET's financial planning and operations within the project.\n\nNow, let's put this into a professional email format with clear bullet points:\n\n---\n\nSubject: Response to Contractual Clarifications and Moving Forward\n\nDear Falah,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. Thank you for your thoughtful response to our proposals. We have reviewed your points and would like to address some key areas for further clarification and mutual agreement:\n\n- **Role During O&M Period**: We agree to a collaborative approach and will remain involved in key decisions during the O&M period, ensuring the project's success.\n- **Proposed Overhead Cap**: In light of your generous offer of $50,000, we've recalculated our overhead costs and propose capping them at $150,000 over eight years. This cap provides financial clarity and aligns with our shared goals.\n- **Steve Williams' Involvement**: Recognizing the importance of Steve's role in justifying the patent fees, we're open to adjusting his involvement to suit the project's needs better. We can retain him in a limited or advisory capacity, or if preferred, explore alternatives while maintaining the project's integrity.\n- **Clarification on Operating Budget**: We'd like to understand more about the implication of \"no separate operating budget for WET\" and how it impacts the project's financial planning.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and are committed to ensuring a successful and transparent collaboration. We look forward to resolving these points and finalizing the agreement.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis email addresses the key points raised by Party One, proposes solutions, and seeks further clarification where needed, all while maintaining a collaborative and positive tone.",

      "content": "can you make this language more professional and a tiny bit more consice no need to do deep edits, clean it up:\n\nDear Falah,\nI hope this email finds you well. Thank you for your thoughtful response to our proposals. Dr. Saad and I have reviewed your points and have found a workable solution. We have a few key areas for further clarification and mutual agreement:\nNote:  We were puzzled with these changes to come at this late stage of drafting the contract and especially after our agreement on the terms and final language a few days ago.  The changes you are proposing are on items that we neve heard discussed before and they were part of the contract circulating among us for the last five to six months.  These changes bring the concern that any decision in the future will take long and would not be easy to reach.  \n\nRole During O&M Period: We agree to a collaborative approach for the duration of the project and recommend the contract, including liability, be valid till the end of the O&M period, as you suggest. WET has no active role during the O&M phase, yet we should remain consulted on key decisions if we are to remain liable.We will add the following to the contract under Party 2 responsibility:  Party 2, at this time, has no specific responsibility, scope of work or budget defined during the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) period subsequent to the  completing the construction of the project.  Party 2 will be available to provide assistance at this stage if requested by Party 1.  Party 2 will develop the scope of work and budget for such assistance when such a scope of work will be more defined at a later stage of construction.  This scope of work and budget will be submitted for Party 2 for approval before start the work and will be included as an addendum the current contract.\nOverhead: In light of your offer to cover overhead for WET to pay costs that are not going to be charged to the project (few of these costs were  mentioned in our previous response).  The 15% is an industry standard in the US to be added for the overhead on any work that is managed by WET as a sub-consultant (not direct hires).   Because of the small size of WET we are willing to reduce the overhead.  As such we are willing to reduce the  WET overhead costs  to 10%. This provides financial clarity and aligns with our shared goals.\nSteve Williams' Involvement: Since Steve seems to be a point of confusion we offer the following.  Steve had no role in justifying the patent fees, He is not a partner or owner of the patent. The fees are a fixed cost anybody must pay to the patent holder to offer the use of the intellectual property (patent), just like paying for the property to build the project on.   \nSteve will be one of the QA/QC team that covers Process Engineering and Hydraulics.  Steve could be replaced by any other competent process engineer and  hydraulic engineer that they still need to be paid by the project.  The thing unique about Steve is that he covers two disciplines that may require two individuals to cover who need to be sub-consulted and paid by the project through WET as part of the QA/QC.  I hope this makes it explicitly clear that this is not negotiable and is not related to licensing the patent.   Bilal I already talked to Steve and he will call me for his input tomorrow\nClarification on Operating Budget: You mention that WET has \"no separate operating budget for WET\".  That is completely untrue and contrary to the written contract that has been circulating for months.  WET will be responsible for hiring a full time project manager in addition to the  subconsultants representing the QA/QC team, construction versatile engineer and support engineering disciplines as stated in details in the contract.  WET will scope of work and budget for the  full time project manager, the QA/QC team and construction oversight team with their operating costs, travel, subscriptions ?, lodging, etc. to be covered by the project.  The project manager will be a direct hire, others will be subconsultants subcontracted as needed.  \n\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and are committed to ensuring a successful and transparent collaboration. We look forward to resolving these points and finalizing the agreement.\nBest regards,\n",

Here's a more polished and concise version of your email:\n\n---\n\nSubject: Clarifications and Proposals for Contractual Terms\n\nDear Falah,\n\nI trust this email finds you in good health. Dr. Saad and I appreciate your detailed response and have devised solutions for mutual agreement. However, we wish to express our surprise at the late-stage changes proposed, especially after our recent consensus on the terms. These unexpected changes suggest future decision-making could be protracted and challenging.\n\nHere are our thoughts and proposals for key areas:\n\n- **Role During O&M Period**: We agree to extend the contract's validity, including liabilities, until the end of the O&M period. WET will not play an active role during this phase but should be consulted on significant decisions. We propose adding to the contract that WET's specific responsibilities, scope, or budget during O&M will be defined later and included as an addendum.\n\n- **Overhead Costs**: Acknowledging your offer to cover overhead, we propose reducing WET's overhead to 10%, below the US industry standard of 15%. This adjustment ensures financial clarity and aligns with our shared objectives.\n\n- **Involvement of Steve Williams**: Clarifying Steve's role, he is not involved in patent fee justification as he is neither a partner nor patent owner. His expertise covers Process Engineering and Hydraulics, and if necessary, can be replaced with equivalent professionals. His involvement is crucial for QA/QC but unrelated to patent licensing.\n\n- **Clarification on Operating Budget**: The statement that WET has \"no separate operating budget\" contradicts the existing contract draft. WET is responsible for hiring a project manager and subcontracting QA/QC and engineering support as detailed in the contract. These costs, including operational expenses like travel and lodging, will be covered by the project.\n\nWe look forward to your understanding and to finalizing an agreement that ensures a successful and transparent partnership.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis version maintains the key points from your original draft, with adjustments for clarity, conciseness, and professionalism. It addresses each point directly and reaffirms your commitment to a successful collaboration.",
