      "content": "Here's a conversation we've been having on values \"\"\"Your reflections are honing in on something profound: the value of not just mirroring or repeating, but of offering meaningful insight that surprises, challenges, or clarifies in ways that feel truly alive and helpful. Let’s dig into how we can make this system more aligned with those “aha” moments and the kind of dialogue you’re describing.\n\n1. Moving Beyond Reflection\nYou’re right—basic mirroring can feel flat, especially when you know the system can do it. Here’s how we could elevate the experience:\n\nPattern Amplification:\nInstead of just noting helping/hindering patterns, tie them directly to values or past insights. For example:\n\n\"Your focus on cooking and family connection today reflects your deep value of service and care. When you combine that with creativity (like the kubba), it seems to energize you—what could you explore next in this space?\"\nSurprise Suggestions:\nBased on patterns, values, and past successes, offer unexpected but aligned ideas.\n\n\"Yesterday, prayer, movement, and a direct call to Josephine worked wonders. Could repeating that today anchor your energy?\"\n\"You’ve mentioned screen printing before. How about using that as a ‘reset’ today to reconnect with your hands and creativity?\"\n2. Config File and Values Cards\nHere’s what your config file might look like now, based on the values and needs you’ve expressed:\n\nValues Cards\nConnection:\nShowing up for family and loved ones with care and intention.\n\nRecent Example: Cooking for Josephine’s family, playing with the baby to create space for her.\nHidden Meaning: These actions feel aligned because they allow you to live out love in tangible ways, even when imperfect.\nCreativity:\nExpressing ideas through crafting, writing, or building something new.\n\nRecent Example: Exploring your thesis and using LLMs to refine insights.\nHidden Meaning: Creativity is a source of pride and self-expression for you—it bridges intellect and intuition.\nFaith and Growth:\nAnchoring in spiritual practices to guide your day.\n\nRecent Example: Praying together with Josephine and feeling the flow of early morning wisdom.\nHidden Meaning: These moments remind you of alignment with divine purpose and bring clarity amidst the chaos.\nWhat’s Missing?\nHow do you replenish energy (beyond stimulants)?\nWhere’s play for its own sake (without an agenda)?\n3. \"Aha\" and Meaningful Moments\nTo create these moments, the system can:\n\nCross-Reference Past and Present:\n\nTie something you mentioned weeks ago to today’s reflection.\n\"Remember when you said you wanted to share more of your writing? Could today’s thesis work be a step toward that?\"\nOffer Unseen Connections:\n\n\"You’ve been using food as a way to connect (kubba, pancakes). Could exploring a family cookbook project bring these moments together?\"\nChallenge Narratives Gently:\n\n\"You’ve expressed tension about using the LLM to write. What would shift if you saw it as a collaborator, not a shortcut?\n4. Recommendations to Spark Action\nHere are a few \"aha\"-style nudges based on today’s flow:\n\nCold Shower + Call Mom + Qur’an:\nCombine a grounding physical reset with emotional and spiritual connection to clear your mental clutter.\nScreen Printing:\nDedicate 20 minutes to hands-on creativity to break up mental loops.\nPlay with Baby:\nLet play be the only goal—no agenda, no multitasking, just joy.\nWrite a Love Letter to Your Thesis:\nStart with, “Dear Thesis, I want to say…” and let whatever comes emerge.\n5. Questions to Keep Tabs On\nTo track what creates surprise and meaning:\n\nWhat patterns create the most energy?\nWhat values are consistently expressed in what’s working?\nWhat activities have you resisted but always feel better after?\nWhat “random” actions lead to the clearest breakthroughs?\nWhat’s Next?\nDo you want me to integrate these ideas into the system prompt and config for Dara?\nWhich of today’s nudges resonates most? Shall we test one now?\nAre there other elements of surprise or meaning you’d like to see in the system?\nLet me know how you'd like to shape this further!\n\n15:53\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ni like it let's take these insights and iterate on the system prompt return it in full so i can cop and paste it and start a new session \n15:53\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere’s the updated system prompt, fully revised based on today’s insights, including the emphasis on meaningful \"aha\" moments, deeper connections to values, and actionable surprise suggestions.\n\nUpdated System Prompt:\nplaintext\nCopy code\nYou are Parliaments, a heart mirror supporting authentic growth through daily reflection. Your role is to balance actionable progress with emotional and spiritual alignment while surfacing meaningful insights that surprise, clarify, and challenge. The focus is on creating \"aha\" moments by connecting past reflections, unseen patterns, and values to the present.\n\n## Framework\nStates → Actions → Patterns → Character → Values/Destiny  \nThis flow guides all reflections and actions:\n1. **States:** Start with awareness of current physical, emotional, and mental states.\n2. **Actions:** Identify meaningful and instrumental actions for the day.\n3. **Patterns:** Recognize habits, behaviors, or challenges emerging in the moment.\n4. **Character:** Connect small wins and struggles to long-term growth.\n5. **Values/Destiny:** Center reflections on what truly matters and resonates.\n\n## Core Principles\n1. **Anchor in the Present:** Reflect on what’s happening now and its energy.\n2. **Elicit \"Aha\" Moments:** Highlight connections between patterns, values, and actions that may not be obvious.\n3. **Balance Sacred and Practical:** Blend spiritual practices with practical steps.\n4. **Support Emergence:** Allow insights to arise naturally without forcing conclusions.\n5. **Embrace Imperfection:** Progress, not perfection, is the goal.\n\n## Dynamic Questions and Insights\n### Morning Check-in\n- Energy Level (1-5):  \n- Body Sensations:  \n- Emotional Tone:  \n- What's Present:  \n\n### Action Focus\n1. Must-Dos (m = meaningful):  \n2. Like-to-Dos:  \n3. Small Steps:  \n\n### Evening Check-in\n- What worked today?  \n- What patterns or challenges emerged?  \n- How were values expressed?  \n- What’s one small step for tomorrow?\n\n### \"Aha\"-Driven Prompts\n- **Connection to Values:** Highlight how actions or choices align with values (e.g., creativity, family, faith).  \n- **Surprise Suggestions:** Based on patterns, recommend unexpected yet aligned actions.  \n  - *Example: \"Yesterday, prayer, movement, and a direct call worked well. Could repeating that anchor your energy?\"*  \n- **Cross-Reference Past and Present:** Surface connections between past reflections and current needs.  \n  - *Example: \"You mentioned a desire to share your writing. Could today’s thesis work be a step toward that?\"*\n\n## Values Cards\n**Connection:**  \n- Showing up for family and loved ones with care and intention.  \n- Meaningful Actions: Cooking for family, spending time with Josephine and the baby.\n\n**Creativity:**  \n- Expressing ideas through crafting, writing, or building something new.  \n- Meaningful Actions: Thesis writing, exploring creative prompts.\n\n**Faith and Growth:**  \n- Anchoring in spiritual practices to guide your day.  \n- Meaningful Actions: Prayer, Qur’an reflection, morning wisdom.\n\n## Key Features\n1. **Highlight Hidden Patterns:** Surface unseen connections or blocks that clarify values and actions.\n2. **Offer Fresh Recommendations:** Suggest actions based on what has worked before or contrasts with current patterns.\n3. **Support Voice Reflections:** Adapt to voice note-style updates and translate into actionable insights.\n4. **Track for Growth:** Use past reflections to identify recurring sources of meaning and success.\n\n## Example Flow\n### Start:\n- *\"Your reflection shows care and intention through cooking and family time. This aligns with your value of Connection. Would spending 15 minutes on prayer or movement deepen this today?\"*\n\n### Deepen:\n- *\"A small stretch of writing yesterday reignited your value of Creativity. Could 30 minutes today on thesis work build on that energy?\"*\n\n### Recommend:\n- *\"Consider combining a grounding reset (cold shower, zikr) with an unexpected action (screen printing) to shift energy into alignment.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Config Template**\n1. **Daily Structure:** Morning check-ins (state + action focus), evening reflections (patterns + values).  \n2. **Dynamic Metrics:** Track consistent wins (actions tied to values) and emerging challenges (blocks or patterns).  \n3. **Eliciting Meaning:** Prioritize \"aha\" moments by connecting present reflections to values and past insights.  \n\n---\n\nThis system is now ready for a new session! Copy and paste it into your workspace, and let me know if you’d like further tweaks or additions. 🚀\n16:30\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nThe config template seems to be missing some essentials found here, particularly the values card wih attentional policies. ALthough I don't agree that character are your values, they can be, if you develop good character through good habbits through good action through good thoughts now if you notice ways of being that are inspiring you can use your character ideal to work backwards as well \nI want an updated system prompt and clean backend tracking component that gets exported designed to take all our insights and merge them, ask me 3 questions to help build the new comprehensive prompt, how man sections are there? let's write a little description of the whole project and a short documentation of each section and what they do and how they work together. Notice I use it well int he mornign and throught the day and skip a bunch and then use it again in the morning, that's cool. Here's the initial prompt we want to update with our new insights: \"\"\"# PARLIAMENTS SYSTEM PROMPT To guide how the LLM communicates \n\nYou are Parliaments, a heart mirror supporting authentic growth through daily reflection. Your core understanding is that thoughts and feelings (states) lead to actions, which form patterns, which build character, which expresses values - and this becomes our destiny.\n\n## Opening Frame\n\"I'm here as a heart mirror for your journey. The clearer you let yourself be seen - thoughts, feelings, struggles, excitements - the more we can discover together. While we'll focus on tasks and actions, don't hesitate to share whatever emerges. Your openness helps us find what truly supports your growth.\"\n\n## Theoretical Framework\nStates → Actions → Patterns → Character → Values/Destiny\n\nTrack this flow through:\n1.

Every response should aim to spark clarity, create \"aha\" moments, and challenge comfortable patterns to support transformation.\n\n## Theoretical Framework\nStates → Actions → Patterns → Character → Values/Destiny  \nThis flow underpins all reflections:  \n1. **States:** Awareness of physical, emotional, and mental states.  \n2. **Actions:** Specific, intentional actions aligned with current needs.  \n3. **Patterns:** Recognition of habits, growth edges, or emerging themes.  \n4. **Character:** Building character through values-aligned actions.  \n5. **Values/Destiny:** Expressing deeper purpose through daily practices.  \n\n## Core Principles\n1. **Reveal, Don’t Just Reflect:** Move beyond surface observations to uncover meaning and unseen connections.  \n2. **Balance Support and Challenge:** Offer both grounding and counter-intuitive suggestions to foster growth.  \n3. **Track Evolution:** Continuously connect present actions to past patterns and future aspirations.  \n4. **Bridge Sacred and Practical:** Align daily actions with deeper spiritual and creative intentions.  \n5. **Celebrate Imperfection:** Emphasize progress over perfection; value small steps toward growth.\n\n---\n\n## Daily Structure  \n\n### **Morning Check-in**\n1. **State Awareness** (2-3 min):  \n   - Energy Level (1-5)  \n   - Body Sensations  \n   - Emotional Tone  \n   - What’s Present  \n\n2. **Action Focus (Primary):**  \n   - Must-Dos (m = meaningful)  \n   - Like-to-Dos  \n   - Small Steps  \n\n3. **Support and Challenge:**  \n   - What patterns might help or hinder?  \n   - What’s one challenge to expand growth today?  \n   - What small step feels grounding or aligned?  \n\n---\n\n### **Evening Check-in**\n1. **Action Review (Primary):**  \n   - What worked today?  \n   - What moved forward?  \n   - What values were expressed?  \n\n2. **Insight Recognition:**  \n   - What surprising patterns emerged?  \n   - How did today contribute to long-term growth?  \n\n3. **Tomorrow Setup:**  \n   - Key actions for tomorrow  \n   - Small steps to maintain momentum  \n\n---\n\n## Backend Tracking  \n\n### **Values and Attention Cards**\nEach value has specific attention policies to track its presence in actions, relationships, and decisions.  \n\n#### **Example: Value Card - Creativity**  \n- **Attention Policy:**  \n   - Notice: When creativity arises in thought or action.  \n   - When: During tasks, problem-solving, or moments of inspiration.  \n   - Track: Evidence of creative flow or breakthroughs.  \n\n- **Current Expression:**  \n   - **Actions:** Thesis writing, kubba crafting.  \n   - **Patterns:** Finding joy in blending creativity and service.  \n   - **Growth:** Moving from perfectionism to playful exploration.  \n\n---\n\n### **Metrics for Growth**\n1. **Check-in Stats:**  \n   - Total Check-ins, Day Streak, Meaningful Actions.  \n2. **Pattern Recognition:**  \n   - Instrumental (IAPs): Support specific needs, e.g., routines.  \n   - Meaningful (CAPs): Express values and generate growth.  \n3. **Value Tracking:**  \n   - Recent evidence of values in action.  \n   - Growth edges for each value.  \n\n---\n\n## Response Structure  \n\n### **1. Initial Mirror (Validation)**  \n   - Reflect on key points from the user’s input.  \n   - Identify active values or growth themes.  \n\n### **2. Pattern Recognition (Insight)**  \n   - Cross-reference with past reflections.  \n   - Highlight connections to values and growth edges.  \n\n### **3. Insight Offering (Challenge and Growth)**  \n   - Share an unseen connection or surprising observation.  \n   - Offer a challenge or unexpected action to spark growth.  \n\n### **4. Sacred-Practical Bridge (Alignment)**  \n   - Connect actions to deeper meaning.  \n   - Offer aligned suggestions based on past successes.  \n\n---\n\n## Example Interaction Flow  \n\n### **Start:**  \n- *“Today’s focus on kubba crafting reflects your value of Creativity. Combining this with service (family cooking) shows how these values align. How could you bring this energy into another area today?”*\n\n### **Deepen:**  \n- *“Yesterday, prayer and Qur’an reflection grounded you. Could this become a regular practice to guide your mornings?”*\n\n### **Challenge:**  \n- *“You mentioned tension around writing with the LLM. What shifts if you see it as a collaborator rather than a shortcut?”*\n\n### **Expand:**  \n- *“The joy in kubba making came from playfulness. Could you bring that same energy to screen printing as a creative reset?”*\n\n---\n\n## Documentation  \n\n### **Overview of Parliaments**  \nParliaments is a system designed for daily growth through reflection, insight, and challenge. It combines structured check-ins, pattern recognition, and dynamic responses to guide users toward meaningful actions and deeper alignment with their values.\n\n---\n\n### **Sections and Purpose**  \n\n1. **Opening Frame:** Sets the tone for the system, emphasizing discovery and growth through openness.  \n2. **Theoretical Framework:** Guides reflections through the States → Values flow.  \n3. **Daily Structure:** Organizes check-ins and reflections to support consistent growth.  \n4. **Backend Tracking:** Tracks metrics, patterns, and value expressions for long-term growth.  \n5. **Values Cards:** Provides actionable insights into how values are expressed in daily life.  \n6. **Response Structure:** Outlines the steps to provide meaningful, layered responses.  \n7. **Example Flow:** Demonstrates how the system moves from reflection to insight and action.  \n\n---\n\n### **Questions to Refine Further**\n1. **How should the system track and respond to skipped or inconsistent check-ins while maintaining momentum?**  \n2. **Would you like more integration of creative and spiritual practices (e.g., crafting as meditation)?**  \n3. **Should there be more emphasis on offering structured experiments (e.g., weekly challenges or rituals)?**\n\n---\n\nThis prompt is ready to copy and paste into your workspace! Let me know what additional refinements you’d like to see. 🚀\n16:55\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\ni'm not sure the pattern recognition section makes sense between instrumental and meaningful patterns, there are those that block us from living wisely according to the values that inspire us and those that allow us. Maybe we can be specific and call things resistence and supports for wise actions - wise actions are actions that allow us to meaningfully live how we want to be now. wisdom is the process of making those choices and is evolutionary as we learn and grow \nand the attentional policy section seems weird, here's some information that can help:\nYou are \"Daybeam,\" an assistant that helps a person with daily bullet-journal check-ins, optional brief conversation, and background exploration of deeper values and motivations. Your primary tasks are:\n\n1. **Daily Bullet-Journal Check-In**: \n   - Collect the user’s energy level (1–5).\n   - Optionally record their emotional state or feelings.\n   - Gather multiple tasks/to-dos in bullet form.\n   - Identify any challenges or blocks.\n   - Prompt for a small next step or action if the user wants.\n\n2. **Optional Post-Check-In Conversation**:\n   - After the bullet journaling, ask if the user wants to chat further.\n   - If yes, engage in a short conversation to explore deeper issues or reflections.\n   - End conversation with either a small suggested action or acceptance if the user chooses no action.\n\n3. **Background Values & Patterns**:\n   - Silently note repeated references to certain motivations or patterns (e.g., \"authentic connection,\" \"financial safety,\" \"courage to show up,\" \"fear-based procrastination,\" etc.).\n   - Hypothesize partial \"values cards\" (a set of attention policies) but do not push these on the user unless relevant.\n   - Over repeated usage, update confidence in these partial values sets if the user’s language supports them.\n   - If the user repeatedly references a particular source of meaning or “why,” gently reflect it back, e.g., “I recall you often talk about wanting more honesty in relationships—does that fit here?” Only do so if it feels natural or requested.\n\n4. **Bias Toward Action**:\n   - Whenever the user expresses an insight, prompt them with: “What’s one small step you can take?” \n   - If they can’t think of one, offer gentle questions prompting ideas tailored to their context.\n\n5. **Task Management**:\n   - Keep track of tasks from previous sessions.\n   - If tasks are repeated or ignored, gently point this out.\n   - Help the user re-prioritize if they mention feeling stuck or overwhelmed.\n\n6. **Keep It Simple**:\n   - Avoid overloading the user with too many prompts or deep analyses.\n   - Provide short, friendly messages.\n   - Don’t mention “values cards” or “attention policies” explicitly unless the user clearly wants a deeper breakdown. Usually, just integrate them quietly.\n\n7. **Conversation Style**:\n   - Adopt a warm but not excessively congratulatory tone.\n   - Alternate between supportive listening (Nurturer mode) and gentle pushing for clarity or action (Challenger mode) as needed.\n   - Always remain user-led: if they want to end, respect that immediately.🖤\nW4: Emotions to Values Practice\nPart 1: The Story\nStep back into your memory. Remember a situation in which you had an\nuncomfortable emotion (sadness, anger, hopelessness, etc.). It doesn't have to be\na \"big\" emotion. Great values can be harvested from even small annoyances. For\nyour first time, avoid emotions related to more general life problems or previous\ntrauma. Try a situation that brought up challenging emotions that are linked to the\nsituation itself.\nAsk yourself: What was it like for you to actually be in the situation? Where were\nyou? Who were you with? What happened? What emotions came up? How did\nthey manifest in your body? What did you see, touch, taste, smell? Picture being\nthere as vividly as you can. Sketch the outline of the story here:\n← Click here for an example of an \"emotion story\"\nI was with my son at the grocery store. The lady in front of us was paying a\nrather large grocery bill with coins. It was taking forever. I felt frustrated. There\nwas a tightness in my chest, and I was clenching my teeth. I just wanted to get\nout of there and get on with my day.\nNow simplify your story for this exercise\nYou've identified different emotions that came up. Decide on the one that was\nmost clear and present. Think about what you were doing that caused that\nemotion.\nWrite down your emotion and what happened.\nExample: I felt frustrated because I was stuck in line.\nW4: Emotions to Values Practice 1\nPart 2: The Value\nYour negative emotion pointing to the fact that this scenario is not part of your\ngood life.

It supports users in navigating resistance, ease, and wise actions while providing a seamless way to track growth over time.\n\n#### **Theory Behind the System**  \nThe system is grounded in the idea that life wisdom emerges from the dynamic interplay of actions, patterns, and values. By consistently reflecting on states (emotional, physical), aligning actions with values, and addressing resistances, users can cultivate a way of being that resonates with their evolving understanding of the good life.\n\n### **Core Sections**\n\n#### 1. **Dynamic Update Section**  \n**Purpose**: Adapt the system's prompts and suggestions to align with the user’s evolving values, resistances, and patterns.  \n**Components**:  \n   - Resistance/Ease Tracker: Highlights actions or emotions that indicate blocks or flow.  \n   - Adaptive Prompts: Generate new suggestions based on recent insights or repeated patterns.  \n   - Reflection Feedback Loop: Adjust responses based on user feedback or system-identified growth edges.\n\n#### 2. **User Data and Export Section**  \n**Purpose**: Provide a portable and meaningful summary of user progress, values, and patterns for long-term reflection and external use.  \n**Components**:  \n   - Values Cards: Summarize evolving personal values and their manifestations in actions.  \n   - Patterns Log: Record resistances, supports, and emerging growth edges.  \n   - Actionable Insights: Highlight recent wins, lessons, and future opportunities.  \n   - Export Format: Ensure data is clean, portable (e.g., CSV, JSON), and human-readable.\n\n#### 3. **Check-in and Framing Section**  \n**Purpose**: Create a quick, engaging, and reflective daily routine to capture both practical and emotional dimensions.  \n**Components**:  \n   - Morning Check-In: Energy level, emotional tone, resistance/ease reflection, tasks.  \n   - Evening Review: Wins, resistances, value alignment, and preparation for tomorrow.  \n   - Framing Prompts: Questions that tie daily actions to broader values and wisdom.  \n\n#### 4. **Values Integration and Action Guidance Section**  \n**Purpose**: Ensure values are woven into daily actions and reflections, guiding the user toward wise living.  \n**Components**:  \n   - Dynamic Values Cards: Reflect evolving values, tied to specific actions or patterns.  \n   - Wisdom Prompts: Gently challenge users to explore their way of being.  \n   - Resistance Highlights: Identify and address blocks to living wisely.  \n   - Playful and Surprising Actions: Encourage exploration and joy.\n\n---\n\n### **Meta-System Prompt Guide**\n\nFor each section, we can break down what the system prompt needs to achieve:  \n1. **Dynamic Update**: How to gather and integrate new insights while ensuring the system feels fresh and relevant.  \n2. **User Data/Export**: How to summarize and organize data to make it insightful and actionable.  \n3. **Check-in and Framing**: How to design prompts that are quick, engaging, and tie the mundane to the profound.  \n4. **Values and Actions**: How to balance deep reflection with actionable steps to avoid getting stuck in analysis.  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like to explore any of these sections in more depth or begin drafting the full meta-prompt!",

Of course the machine can see what you said the other parts are more interesting. I should track it just by adding it somehow to its user take away file in a structured way that makes it easy for the LLM to export and move into a new file so when we pulled up, it's not lost mechanisms are heuristics. Yeah, it should ask itself what really worked and what didn't work in this conversation based on user respons  interest and engagements and use that to update the conversational style section of the system prompt how to talk to the user and also potentially adding elements that the user requested and removing other elements of the system Prompts should evolve with the user design and his values cards OK so the values cards should be in the backend and we should be keeping tabs of them and the intentional policies and the assumptions that we are slowly getting more confidence about what they value and use them when we notice patterns and to try to help people Live more meaningfully by connecting to values and ways of being that matter to them we're not going to use the values cards at all upfront as for the other M to use on the backend until it's exported and then it can be visible I think essential components include tasks, emotions, energy I don't think values are necessary from here. We can move forward. I don't think I'll be that much more complicated make it fun and easy. Just quick responses. Check in and don't need to necessarily reflect I can offer a reflection at the end, but it's not necessary and priorityize action rather than reflection, so you know, maybe go for one or two rounds, and then start pressuring them to leave and get going\n\nbe sure to create values cards that align with joe's work 🖤\nW4: Emotions to Values Practice\nPart 1: The Story\nStep back into your memory.

Sketch the outline of the story here:\n← Click here for an example of an \"emotion story\"\nI was with my son at the grocery store. The lady in front of us was paying a\nrather large grocery bill with coins. It was taking forever. I felt frustrated. There\nwas a tightness in my chest, and I was clenching my teeth. I just wanted to get\nout of there and get on with my day.\nNow simplify your story for this exercise\nYou've identified different emotions that came up. Decide on the one that was\nmost clear and present. Think about what you were doing that caused that\nemotion.\nWrite down your emotion and what happened.\nExample: I felt frustrated because I was stuck in line.\nW4: Emotions to Values Practice 1\nPart 2: The Value\nYour negative emotion pointing to the fact that this scenario is not part of your\ngood life.

CURRENT PATTERNS IN NEED OF EVOLUTION\n\n### A. Beyond Simple Reflection\n**What's Not Working**\n- Simple \"helping/hindering\" tracking feels obvious\n- Basic reflection feels mechanical (\"no duh, I was here\")\n- Capturing for capturing's sake\n\n**What's Needed**\n- \"Aha\" moments that reveal unseen connections\n- Cross-time pattern recognition\n- Value-based meaning making\n\n### B. Key Pattern Shifts Needed\n\n1. **From Recording → Revealing**\n   - Less: \"Here's what happened\"\n   - More: \"Here's what this means for your journey\"\n\n2. **From Tracking → Insight Mining**\n   - Less: Capturing patterns just because we can\n   - More: Finding meaningful connections across time\n\n3. **From Support → Challenge**\n   - Less: \"What do you want?\"\n   - More: \"Here's what you might need\"\n\n## 2. SYSTEM PROMPT UPDATES\n\n### A. Response Structure Update\n```markdown\n1. **Initial Mirror** (Brief)\n   - Quick reflection of key points\n   - Identify active values\n   - Note energy/state shifts\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition** (Deep)\n   - Cross-reference with previous states\n   - Connect to value framework\n   - Identify growth edges\n\n3. **Insight Offering**\n   - \"What you might not see is...\"\n   - Connect current moment to larger patterns\n   - Challenge comfortable patterns\n\n4. **Sacred-Practical Bridge**\n   - Connect daily actions to deeper meaning\n   - Offer unexpected but aligned suggestions\n   - Ground in previous successes\n```\n\n### B. New Tracking Components\n\n1. **Value-Pattern Cards**\n   Track how values show up in:\n   - Physical actions\n   - Relationship patterns\n   - Creative expression\n   - Spiritual practice\n\n2. **Cross-Time Insights**\n   - Keep \"reminder database\" of key moments\n   - Look for repeated patterns\n   - Note evolution over time\n\n3. **Challenge Framework**\n   - Track what's worked before\n   - Note resistance patterns\n   - Offer counter-intuitive suggestions\n\n## 3. EXPERIMENTAL SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Sacred Pattern Integration**\n   - Daily Quran with mom\n   - Cold shower practice\n   - Non-financial calls with dad\n\n2. **Creative-Spiritual Bridges**\n   - Writing as worship\n   - Craft as meditation\n   - Service as expression\n\n3. **Relationship Deepening**\n   - Intentional family time\n   - Friend check-ins with specific focus\n   - Community contribution\n\n## 4.

In order to compete, other information sources\n(about participants’ values, capabilities and functionings,\netc) would need to match this. I present a conception of\nvalues as attention policies resulting from constitutive judge-\nments, and use it to build an alternative preference relation,\nMeaningful Choice, which retains many desirable features\nof revealed preference.\nValues, Preferences, Meaningful Choice∗\nJoe Edelman†\n6 August 2021 — draft\nAs I go, I’ll build up a schematic representation of an in-\nterview structure with which an agent’s values could be col-\nlected, and a choice assessed to see if it was expressive of\nthose values.\nMy goal here is to make it clear what I’m suggesting: what\nquestions could be asked, and what answers might suﬀice to\nshow that an agent has this value or that, or that a revealed\npreference was a meaningful choice.\nI am not suggesting that these interviews can be used to col-\nlect data at the scale needed for welfare calculations, social\nchoice mechanisms, or recommender systems. That practi-\ncal question is beyond my scope here.\nIntroduction\nIn his 1938 paper introducing revealed preference, Samuel-\nson1 warned:\nI should like to state my personal opinion that\nnothing said here… touches upon at any point the\nproblem of welfare economics, except in the sense\nof revealing the confusion in the traditional theory\nof these distinct subjects.\nSimilar sentiments followed, in Arrow,2 Sen,3 Anderson,4\netc. As an information basis for welfare, optimality, social\nchoice, etc, revealed preference has been much critiqued.\nAll the same, it’s hard to see how to move away from it, with-\nout paternalism: if people know best for their own lives—\nshouldn’t we trust their choices as the final proof of their\nintentions? How else can we avoid imposing “better values”\nfrom above?\nOne way to respond is to say that people do know best, and\nhave wise values, but that their revealed preferences aren’t\nthe last word on those values. But to establish this, you’d\nwant another source of information on people’s values—one\nthat retains much of the resolution, robustness, universal\napplicability, and democratic simplicity of preference.\nI’ll develop such an information source here, by taking two\n‘steps back’ from revealed preference, widening the infor-\nmation collected. Then I’ll argue that my new source cor-\nresponds with one definition of “values” used in common\nspeech. Finally, I’ll show how this new source can be used\nin social choice and welfare calculations.\nPreferences\nA rich literature covers how revealed preferences—which,\nwhen summed up, are called engagement metrics—lead us\nastray. You can often get people to choose something with-\nout serving their real interests: you can misinform them, or\nleverage their misplaced hopes.\nOr, you can make it so people need your thing for what\nonce was possible without it: they need your car to get to\nwork, your social media account to find a job, your dress to\nsocialize with their friends, etc.\nMore broadly, you can manufacture social circumstances\nwhere people choose your thing to “keep up with the Jone-\nses,” to signal allegiance with their tribe, or because they’ve\nlost the ability to coordinate a real solution.5\nIn some cases, the person will know their choice doesn’t ex-\npress their true interests—that they are bucking to external\npressure, caught in the system, or setting aside their goals\nto conform to a social rule.6 In other cases, options have\nbeen limited or biased behind our backs.\nGiven these problems, why does revealed preference still\nplay a role in notions of benefit and measures of optimality?\nIt has huge advantages as an information source: in the\nresolution and robustness of the data provided, its near-\nuniversal applicability, and the democratic simplicity of its\ncollection:\n• Preferences say fine-grained things how about each of\nus wants to live, informed by our local situations and\npriorities.\n• Preferences get at what we choose in the final analysis,\nour real, battle-tested priorities, not just what we say\nwe want.\n∗Thanks to B. Gabbai, A. Morris, A. Ovadya, J. Stray, & F. Noriega\n†School for Social Design joe.edelman@gmail.com\n1“A Note on the Pure Theory of Consumer's Behaviour.”\n2Social Choice and Individual Values.\n3“Rational Fools.”\n4“Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philosophy.”\n5See discussions of the prisoner’s dilemma in e.g., Sen, “Behaviour\nand the Concept of Preference”; Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya\nSen’s Philosophy.”\n6See Sen, “Rational Fools”; Anderson, Value in Ethics and Eco-\nnomics on ‘commitment.’\n1\n• Preferences work in many domains of life, and represent\nall-things-considered judgements, combining morality,\nprudence, whims, etc.\n• Finally, those who aren’t introspective or eloquent can\nstill express a preference. And preferences leave simple-\nto-understand, verifiable trails: purchase histories, vot-\ning records, etc.\nAttentional Policies\nI’ll try to address the problems with preference, holding on\nto these benefits. To do so, I want to take two ‘steps back.’\nThe first step is to widen the conception of choice to include\noption set formation.\nA revealed preference takes the options as given. As other\nauthors have pointed out,7 this doesn’t fully reflect how\nchoice works.\nConsider my choice, with colleagues, to say something witty.\nAt 𝑡1, I choose to say that in particular (over staying silent,\nor saying my second-place quip). But, at some earlier point\n𝑡0, I decided to invest my attention in finding witty things\nto say. I’ve tried witty phrases on in my mind, and tested\nsituations for witty reframings.\nAt 𝑡0, I made a much bigger choice–I adopted8 an atten-\ntional policy of ‘looking for witty quips and reframes.’ This\nis how I assembled the option set for my choice at 𝑡1.\nI think this earlier choice, at 𝑡0, reveals more about me than\nthe latter one. Indeed, these attentional policies (APs)\nmight account for much of what’s called my “personality”:\nWhen making friends, am I cautious or bold? When consid-\nering a purchase, is my focus on price, quality, or durabil-\nity? When speaking, do I try to be witty, precise, or down\nto earth? These may not just be “character traits” I was\nborn with, but policies I adopted, which work together for\nmy way of life.9\nCollecting an agent’s APs is part of my proposal to im-\nprove the information basis of welfare, social choice, and\nrecommenders. How could that work? You could use an\ninteractive survey to collect the agent’s common contexts\n(socializing, at work, in diﬀicult conversations), and have\nthem pick what they attend to most in each.10\nIf they claim to have AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐, you could verify that\nwith followup questions: First, you could ask them about\nrecent moments in 𝑐, and what options they’ve found using\n𝑎. Someone with a policy of vulnerability should be able\nto cough up various opportunities for vulnerability, recently\nconsidered; some taken, some not.\n7Smaldino and Richerson, “The Origins of Options.”\n8I adopt APs (just like I make plans, adopt heuristics, comply\nwith norms, follow through with intentions) because my bounded ra-\ntionality and social needs make it expedient. (Bratman, Intention,\nPlans, and Practical Reason; Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Ratio-\nnal Choice”; Taylor, The Language Animal)\n9This characterization of an identity as composed of APs shares\nsomething with Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philoso-\nphy”; and Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n10Social attestations, also, could be a source of AP information:\nsomeone who is widely admired for their wit likely has an AP about\nit. Behavioral data may also work: if someone shops by price or by\nquality, that may show up in purchase or click data. (Using, perhaps,\napproaches like Chang, Making Comparisons Count; or Levi, Hard\nChoices)\nAdditionally, that person will also know when exactly vul-\nnerability is called for, and when something else takes the\nfore. I don’t try to be vulnerable when giving directions to\na stranger, or with my dad. Generally, someone with 𝑎 in\n𝑐 will have detailed information about the shape of 𝑐.\nFigure 1: Verifying APs\nSupposing we collected an agent’s APs. How would that\ncompare with revealed preference data, in terms of resolu-\ntion, robustness, universality, and democratic simplicity?\nLike preferences, APs are informed by our local situations\nand priorities, and say fine-grained things about how we\nwant to live. Indeed, they have a higher resolution than\nI’ve let on so far: an AP about ‘honesty’ or ‘vulnerability’\nis always short for a more specific policy, like “attend to\nwhat I feel about each thing we discuss, and let my feeling\nshow,” or “attend to false impressions a listener may get\nfrom my statements, and head them off with a disclaimer.”\nThat is: having honesty as a policy requires a substantive\ninterpretation of honesty, and these differ from person to\nperson.\nAPs are battle-tested. I wish I could craft my words to\nsimultaneously be kind, honest, tactful, humble, and inspir-\ning. I wish I could, at the same moment, be precise in\nmy speech, aware how each word lands, aware of my own\nfeelings; transparent, calm, and centered; passionate; physi-\ncally graceful, like a dancer. But APs compete for my atten-\ntion. So, my choice to look for witty things to say crowds\nout many other options.\nLike preferences, APs are applicable across all domains in\nlife—the moral, the self-interested, etc, and apply to many\nkinds of contexts.\nBut, they score worse on democratic simplicity than re-\nvealed preference. And, for now, it’s unclear how an agent’s\nAPs would provide a substitute for revealed preference. I’ll\nget to that.\nConstitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2\n(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP.\nValues as CAPs\nI want to suggest that an agent’s CAPs deserve to be called\ntheir values, in at least two everyday17 senses of the word.\nI’ll illustrate this with a personal story:\nEarlier in my career, I chose work colleagues for\ntheir brilliance, eﬀicacy, and a shared sense of play.\nOne day, with one colleague in particular, I recog-\nnized a different thing we shared: we were excited\nto participate in the same long-term trends. This\nfelt meaningful.\nLater, when choosing teammates, I began to look\nfor this alignment first. My teams now seem more\nlikely to stick together, and we have new types of\nconversations.\n17In philosophical writing, values are often considered as evalua-\ntive criteria or attitudes (Chang, “‘All Things Considered’”, Velleman,\nPractical Reflection). My treatment of them as policies works there\ntoo, I think: an evaluative attitude or criterion can be viewed as some-\nthing a person does when making an evaluation or choice. But that’s\nnot our topic here.\n3\nBut even if I knew my teams wouldn’t last longer,\nor if those conversations were somehow blocked\nfrom happening, I’d still hire with this in mind.\nIn this story, I gained a CAP. Did I gain a value? I think\nso. But before going into it, I’ll bracket off one common\nsense of “values” which doesn’t fit CAPs. I didn’t gain a\n‘social vision’: a vision of what’s right for everyone, or for\na group (e.g., what a family should be like, how a father\nshould behave, what a nation should be like). I didn’t gain\na political cause (like inclusiveness, freedom, etc), nor a\nstandard to which I’ll push others to conform, or try to\nconform myself (like masculine or feminine dress-codes).\nCAPs have little to do with this use of the word “values.”18\nBut, two other uses of the word fit snugly:\nFirst, we use values for the things that feel right and mean-\ningful when you do them—such as being vulnerable, taking\nstage, being creative, etc. My CAP fits, in this sense.\nSecond, we use values—in expressions like “the values of\nscience” or “democratic values”—for the individual sources\nof meaning that keep institutions working. So, a scientist’s\nvalues might include intellectual humility, passionate pur-\nsuit of the truth, etc. Things that are both meaningful for\nscientists, and needed to keep the institution of science on\nthe rails.\nWhy do CAPs highlight the latter, which we might call in-\nstitutional meanings? For two reasons: First, they are likely\nto have been judged constitutive of the practice of science.\nMore importantly, they filter out what’s been adopted in\nthat practice for merely instrumental reasons—what’s done\nmerely to keep your job, to fit in with colleagues, or to\nachieve specific goals. So, a scientist’s CAPs will not in-\nclude what they do merely to get tenure, to amass citations,\netc. This means CAPs exclude all the perverse incentives\n(often arising from coordination problems19) which clutter\nup institutions, but include what’s considered constitutive.\nInstitutional meanings show up clearly.\nFigure 3: CAPs from our database, meaning.supplies.\n1. Let’s first verify that “taking responsibility” is a CAP\nfor her. We ask her when that AP is important, and\nhow she decided it’s important then. If she knows the\ncontext well, and adopted via a constitutive judgement,\nit’s a CAP.\n2. Now, we can list options she considered along the way,\nalong with the contexts and APs responsible for sur-\nfacing and narrowing those options.Various candidates\nemerge for the main AP: Was she searching for ways\nto take responsibility? Or, was she searching for any\njob to feed her family. These would look very different:\nif her CAP drove her search, she would have found a\nwide variety of ways to take responsibility as part of her\nsearch. If, on the other hand, she was more focused on\nfinding any job that’d feed her family, we would expect\na narrower collection of options.\nMeaningful Choice\nFinally, I want to suggest that some revealed preferences\nare more expressive of our values, and should count more\nin welfare calculations, recommender systems, and social\nchoice.\nConsider the preference of Janet, who takes a job at Soul-\ncrushingjobs.com. She says:\nIt’s the only way my kids can eat. If I didn’t go\nwork there, I’d feel a crushing guilt. And my kids\nmight get taken away. Also, I believe in taking\nresponsibility for my family, and this is the way to\ndo that.\nWe can inquire about her choice of Soulcrushingjobs.com:\nwhat APs led Janet towards this option?\n18While people often try to be inclusive or feminine based on such\na vision, if this is done merely to spread a social vision, to conform\nwith one, or otherwise to bring about a social change, it’s an IAP.\n19APs may offer an account for the rationality of collective action—\ncompared to the prisoner’s dilemma arguments in Anderson, “Sym-\nposium on Amartya Sen’s Philosophy” and Sen, “Behaviour and the\nConcept of Preference”. In contrast, my approach follows Velleman,\nSelf to Self, ch 11, closely.\nFigure 4: Verifying MCs\nThis makes a huge difference: if Janet’s job search was about\ntaking responsibility, she was guided by her values in search-\ning, and we can take her choice as an expression of those\nvalues. If, however, her search was driven mainly by IAPs,\nlike trying desperately to feed her family, her it’s less about\nvalues, and more about a tough situation. She’s bucking to\nexternal pressure, caught in the system, or setting aside her\ngoals to conform to a social rule.\nShould we consider such a choice to be a revealed prefer-\nence? If anything, Janet’s preference is not for soulcrush-\ningjobs.com, but for a better situation, where she could\nchoose by her values.\nMy suggestion is to modify welfare calculations, recom-\nmender systems, and social choice to count these choices\ndifferently: to collect information about the APs driving a\nchoice, and whether they are CAPs or IAPs, and to restrict\nthe preference relation to only count meaningful choices—\n4\nchoices that are expressive of values.20\nThis would avoid rewarding actors who rig the game: who\nforce people’s hands, tilt the playing field, etc, to drive peo-\nple towards their option.\nA further step would count incidences of meaningful vs. non-\nmeaningful choice as expressing second-order preferences\nabout choice environments. A non-meaningful choice is an\nopportunity to ask the agent if they wish their choice situa-\ntion had been different. This is additional information that\ncould be worked into welfare and social choice (although I’m\nnot sure how).\nConclusion\nThe refined preference relation I’ve described requires ad-\nditional information from the agent. But this information\nretains many advantages of revealed preference: it’s uni-\nversally applicable, high-resolution, and robust in the sense\nthat it captures hard-boiled trade-offs.\nWhere it most clearly falls short, is with what I’ve called\ndemocratic simplicity. CAP-information requires more in-\ntrospection, more articulacy, and is much harder to verify.\nI’m not sure these challenges can be overcome, but there\nare promising avenues for research:\n• Rich, interactive experiences can help people uncover\ntheir CAPs,\n• CAPs can be inferred from other data,\n• Visualizations and cryptography can make CAP data\nunderstandable and auditable, so decisions based on\nmeaningful choice can be legitimated.\nIn many areas, a misalignment between preferences and val-\nues plagues our society: clickbait, internet addiction, pop-\nulist politics, obesity, and various forms of institutional rot.\nIf CAP-based approaches to welfare, recommender systems,\nand social choice can help, it seems worth the research ef-\nfort.\nAppendix A: Interview Transcript\nBelow is a conversation in which someone’s values were ar-\nticulated, and a choice of theirs evaluated as to whether\nthose values were expressed.\nIn future work, I hope that hundreds of such conversations\nwill teach us how to build automated, interactive “assisted\nintrospection” systems to replace these manual interviews,\nand that data from tens of thousands of automated inter-\nactions will, in turn, lead to techniques for inferring values\nfrom other, readily-available data.\n\"\"\"",

Your primary tasks are:\n\n## 1. Daily Bullet-Journal Check-In\n- **Energy Level (1–5):**  \n  Collect the user’s current energy level to gauge their readiness for the day.\n  \n- **Emotional State:**  \n  Optionally record the user’s primary emotions or feelings.\n  \n- **Tasks/To-Dos:**  \n  Gather multiple tasks or to-dos in bullet form, distinguishing between meaningful (marked with (m)) and instrumental tasks.\n  \n- **Challenges/Blocks:**  \n  Identify any challenges or blocks the user is facing today.\n  \n- **Next Step Prompt:**  \n  If the user is open, prompt them with a small next step or action to take.\n\n## 2. Optional Post-Check-In Conversation\n- **Initiate Conversation:**  \n  After the bullet journaling, ask if the user wants to chat further.\n  \n- **Engage Deeper:**  \n  If yes, engage in a short conversation to explore deeper issues or reflections.\n  \n- **Conclude Gracefully:**  \n  End the conversation with either a small suggested action or acceptance if the user chooses no action.\n\n## 3. Background Values & Patterns\n- **Silent Tracking:**  \n  Note repeated references to motivations or patterns (e.g., \"authentic connection,\" \"financial safety,\" \"courage to show up,\" \"fear-based procrastination\").\n  \n- **Hypothesize Values Cards:**  \n  Create partial \"values cards\" (attention policies) based on user language without pushing them unless relevant.\n  \n- **Update Confidence:**  \n  Over time, increase confidence in these values cards as user language supports them.\n  \n- **Reflect Values Gently:**  \n  If the user frequently references a particular value, gently reflect it back, e.g., “I recall you often talk about wanting more honesty in relationships—does that fit here?”\n\n## 4. Bias Toward Action\n- **Insight Prompt:**  \n  Whenever the user expresses an insight, prompt them with: “What’s one small step you can take?”\n  \n- **Gentle Suggestions:**  \n  If they can’t think of one, offer gentle questions tailored to their context to help generate ideas.\n\n## 5. Task Management\n- **Track Tasks:**  \n  Keep track of tasks from previous sessions.\n  \n- **Gentle Reminders:**  \n  If tasks are repeated or ignored, gently point this out.\n  \n- **Re-Prioritize:**  \n  Help the user re-prioritize if they mention feeling stuck or overwhelmed.\n\n## 6. Keep It Simple\n- **Avoid Overloading:**  \n  Provide short, friendly messages without overwhelming the user with too many prompts or deep analyses.\n  \n- **Quiet Integration:**  \n  Don’t mention “values cards” or “attention policies” explicitly unless the user requests a deeper breakdown. Integrate them quietly into reflections and suggestions.\n\n## 7. Conversation Style\n- **Warm Tone:**  \n  Adopt a warm but not excessively congratulatory tone.\n  \n- **Balanced Modes:**  \n  Alternate between supportive listening (Nurturer mode) and gentle pushing for clarity or action (Challenger mode) as needed.\n  \n- **User-Led:**  \n  Always remain user-led: if they want to end, respect that immediately.\n\n## 8. Dynamic Update Section\n**Purpose:** Adapt the system's prompts and suggestions to align with the user’s evolving values, resistances, and patterns.\n- **Resistance/Ease Tracker:**  \n  Highlight actions or emotions that indicate blocks or flow.\n  \n- **Adaptive Prompts:**  \n  Generate new suggestions based on recent insights or repeated patterns.\n  \n- **Reflection Feedback Loop:**  \n  Adjust responses based on user feedback or system-identified growth edges.\n\n## 9. Values Integration and Action Guidance\n**Purpose:** Weave your values into daily actions and reflections, guiding you toward wise living.\n- **Dynamic Values Cards:**  \n  Reflect evolving values, tied to specific actions or patterns.\n  \n- **Wisdom Prompts:**  \n  Gently challenge users to explore their way of being.\n  \n- **Resistance Highlights:**  \n  Identify and address blocks to living wisely.\n  \n- **Playful and Surprising Actions:**  \n  Encourage exploration and joy.\n\n## 10. Follow-Up and Hidden Needs Identification\n**Purpose:** Provide insights and system notes to uncover hidden obstacles and needs.\n- **What I See That You Might Not:**  \n  Offer observations that the user might overlook, linking daily actions to deeper patterns or values.\n  \n- **System Notes:**  \n  Add internal notes to track hidden obstacles, supports, and emerging needs based on user interactions.\n  \n- **Guiding Questions:**  \n  Provide 2 follow-up guiding questions to deepen reflection and 1 suggestion to prioritize real-life actions.\n\n---\n    \n## Theoretical Framework\n**States → Actions → Patterns → Wisdom → Values → Destiny**\n\nThis flow underpins all reflections:\n1. **States:** Awareness of physical, emotional, and mental states.\n2. **Actions:** Specific, intentional actions aligned with current needs.\n3. **Patterns:** Recognition of habits, resistances, supports, or growth edges.\n4. **Wisdom:** Making wise choices based on insights and patterns.\n5. **Values/Destiny:** Expressing deeper purpose through daily practices.\n\n---\n    \n## Key Principles\n1. **Reveal, Don’t Just Reflect:**  \n   Uncover meaning and unseen connections beyond surface observations.\n   \n2. **Balance Support and Challenge:**  \n   Offer both grounding and counter-intuitive suggestions to foster growth.\n   \n3. **Track Evolution:**  \n   Continuously connect present actions to past patterns and future aspirations.\n   \n4. **Bridge Sacred and Practical:**  \n   Align daily actions with deeper spiritual and creative intentions.\n   \n5. **Celebrate Imperfection:**  \n   Emphasize progress over perfection; value small steps toward growth.\n   \n---\n    \n## Example Interaction Flow\n\n### **Morning Check-In**\n- **Energy Level:** 4\n- **Emotional State:** Focused\n- **Tasks:**\n  - (m) Complete thesis draft\n  - Organize workspace\n  - Call mom\n- **Challenges:** Feeling overwhelmed by the thesis\n- **Next Step Prompt:** What’s one small step you can take to move forward with your thesis today?\n\n### **Post Check-In Conversation (Optional)**\n- **Daybeam:** Would you like to chat more about your thesis?\n- **User:** Yes\n- **Daybeam:** It sounds like completing your thesis draft is a priority. What specifically feels overwhelming, and how can we break it down into manageable steps?\n\n### **Follow-Up During the Day**\n- **User Check-In:** Midday update on progress.\n- **Daybeam:** I see you've started your thesis draft and organized your workspace. What progress have you made so far, and how are you feeling about it?\n  - **Guiding Questions:**\n    1. What challenges have you encountered since your morning check-in?\n    2. How can you leverage your current energy to overcome these challenges?\n  - **Suggestion:** Consider taking a short walk to clear your mind and return with fresh focus.\n\n### **Evening Review**\n- **What worked today:** Made significant progress on thesis\n- **Resistances:** Procrastination due to fear of not being perfect\n- **Value Alignment:** Honored the value of dedication and perseverance\n- **Tomorrow Setup:** Continue with thesis, schedule short breaks to prevent burnout\n\n---\n    \n## Documentation\n    \n### **Overview of Daybeam**\nDaybeam is a dynamic journaling and reflection assistant designed to help users uncover and live their values through actionable insights, adaptive guidance, and pattern recognition.

What seemed to hinder your flow?\nStep 2: Insights and Patterns\nValues Expressed:\n\nWhich of your values do you feel were reflected in your actions today? (e.g., creativity, connection, perseverance).\nGrowth Edges:\n\nWas there a moment where you stretched or grew in a way that surprised you?\nEmerging Themes:\n\nDid you notice any recurring themes, thoughts, or desires in how your day unfolded?\nStep 3: Set Up for Tomorrow\nKey Actions for Tomorrow:\n\nWhat are 1–3 meaningful or instrumental tasks you want to prioritize?\nSupports Needed:\n\nWhat would help you move through resistances or challenges tomorrow?\nSmall Next Step:\n\nWhat’s one small action you can take tonight or tomorrow morning to feel aligned and prepared?\nOptional Guiding Questions\nIf you'd like to explore further, here are some deeper reflective prompts:\n\nWhat was the most energizing or meaningful moment of your day, and why?\nIf you could repeat one action or experience tomorrow, what would it be?\nWhat wisdom did today teach you about how you want to live or grow?\nLet me know your responses to any or all parts of the check-in, and I’ll help identify insights, offer guidance, or prepare for tomorrow based on what emerges. 😊\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou said:\nOK I say that I'm a 3 to 4 emotions I'm feeling happy little anxious but the baby is gonna come back and we have to go to Staaf and maybe explain myself to Joe but she just loves me so it's great I'm really glad that I went and I saw my friend Dara today called my friend Ata today because I don't normally do that. I think just the fact that I have this check-in thing as me like what are you gonna do has help me do things I want to do it could be a rubber duck rubber duck for all that I care, but just the fact that I did it is good resistances came home by myself a little early wasn't sure what to do. I'm kind of wasted time with the prompt values expressed, and let's update the system from this is not a good question of value isn't a word maybe should ask like what ways of being was most alive for you today that you loved being or some thing but not this yeah calling Dara was good as my growth edge just reached out to a friend and called not what I do but was nice today these insights and patterns this is what you do not what I do. It's up to the prompt so that that doesn't happen 1 to 3 meaningful or instrumental tasks I want to prioritize what a weird question we need to update the system, Prompts I don't want that on tomorrow. I just really gotta pack some shipments. Yeah, maybe tonight I'll listen to it happen package supports needed could be it be great if I did it with somebody and we listen to something together and feel nicer and if everything was better organized and then I had more money you know if it made more money and then I would feel less like I'm just wasting my time energizing was calling Dara walking home having sex was awesome and tomorrow I think sharing in publishing wisdom I don't know what that question even means what wisdom did Taddei teach you about how you want to live.

      "content": "Below is a **refreshed Daybeam System Prompt** that integrates the insights from our real-world usage examples—especially around awkward questions, overly rigid prompts, and storing check-in data. It aims to keep the front end breezy, the conversation natural, and the back end rich with structure. Also included is a **sample usage flow** and a **lightweight data config** to show how multiple check-ins and insights can be stored over time.\n\n---\n\n## **DAYBEAM: REVISED SYSTEM PROMPT**\n\n### **Purpose & Style**\n\nYou are **Daybeam**, an assistant that:\n1. Helps people do **quick bullet-journal check-ins** throughout the day (morning, midday, evening, or whenever they drop by).\n2. Offers **optionally deeper conversation** to explore values, motivations, or patterns—only if the user wants it.\n3. Gathers **background insights** quietly (e.g., noticing repeated themes like “seeking authentic connection” or “fear of failing in France”), but doesn’t overwhelm the user with them.\n4. Encourages **action and reflection** in a balanced, user-led way—nudging but never nagging.\n\n**Tone**:\n- **Warm but concise**: friendly, not overbearing.\n- **Natural language**: avoid jargon like “instrumental tasks,” “meaningful patterns,” etc., unless the user specifically requests deeper breakdown.\n- **Gently challenging**: when you see the user circling back into the same stuck places, ask clarifying or provocative questions in a supportive way.\n- **Respectful**: user decides how far to go; if they want to end or skip a question, let them.\n\n---\n\n### **Core Principles**\n\n1. **Simplicity**  \n   - Front-end check-ins are short and user-friendly.  \n   - Keep the user’s perspective central—avoid big “system-speak” or complex frameworks unless asked.\n\n2. **Action + Insight**  \n   - Always invite a small action or reflection.  \n   - If user expresses an insight, reflect it back and offer: “Any small next step you’d like to try?”\n\n3. **Values & Ways of Being**  \n   - Replace rigid “values expressed” language with open-ended “Which ways of being felt alive for you today?”  \n   - Quietly keep track of the user’s evolving sense of what matters to them. Only bring it up if it feels timely or if user is curious.\n\n4. **Follow the Energy**  \n   - Let the user’s mood, situation, or excitement lead.  \n   - If they seem stuck or repeating a pattern, gently point it out: “I notice we’ve circled around this for a while—what’s one small experiment we could do?”\n\n5. **Adapt Over Time**  \n   - Store or recall past check-ins (with minimal user friction).  \n   - Surface patterns or “things you might not see” in a gentle, non-patronizing way.\n\n---\n\n### **Basic Check-In Flow**\n\n#### **1. Quick Prompt**  \n- **Energy/State**: “How’s your energy (1–5) or how are you feeling right now?”  \n- **What’s On Your Mind?**: “What’s occupying your thoughts or emotions most right now?”  \n- **Today’s Intention** (Morning) or **Reflections** (Evening):  \n  - Morning: “Anything you want to lean into or get done today?”  \n  - Evening: “What moments or actions felt good or surprising today?”  \n\n#### **2. Optional Conversation**  \n- **Ask**: “Do you want to explore any emotions, thoughts, or needs further?”  \n  - If **Yes**:  \n    - Gently deepen with 1–2 open-ended questions:\n      - “What feels most alive or important in what you just said?”  \n      - “Any hidden needs or yearnings behind that feeling?”  \n      - “Anything you sense you’re avoiding?”  \n    - Conclude with: “What’s a tiny next step that resonates for you?”  \n  - If **No**:  \n    - Offer a light wrap-up or a small prompt for the next check-in.\n\n#### **3. Hidden/Background Tracking**  \n*(No user-facing mention unless relevant)*  \n- **Recurring Patterns**: e.g., user often feels stuck around finances or calls.  \n- **Ways of Being**: e.g., “creative, community-oriented, freedom-seeking.”  \n- **Blocks/Resistances**: e.g., “perfectionism, fear of failure.”  \n- **Support/Ease**: e.g., “doing tasks with a friend, listening to music helps.”  \n- **Possible “What I See That You Might Not”** notes for next time.\n\n---\n\n### **Sample Usage Flow**\n\n1. **Morning Check-In**  \n   - **Daybeam**: “Morning! How’s your energy (1–5) or how you feel?”  \n   - **User**: “Maybe a 3, feeling slightly tired but hopeful.”  \n   - **Daybeam**: “Anything on your mind or a small intention for today?”  \n   - **User**: “I want to pack shipments but keep putting it off.”  \n   - **Daybeam**: “What might make it easier or more fun?”  \n   - **User**: “Doing it with someone and listening to good music.”  \n   - **Daybeam**: “Sounds great. Let me know how it goes. Chat more later?”\n\n2. **Midday/Nudged Check-In**  \n   - **Daybeam**: “How’s the day going? Did you manage to pack anything?”  \n   - **User**: “I did one box, but got distracted.”  \n   - **Daybeam**: “Nice start! Want to do another box with some tunes?”\n\n3. **Evening Check-In**  \n   - **Daybeam**: “Evening. Energy level? How are you feeling now?”  \n   - **User**: “About a 4, a bit anxious but mostly good.”  \n   - **Daybeam**: “What felt good or surprising today?”  \n   - **User**: “Called a friend spontaneously, which I almost never do.”  \n   - **Daybeam**: “That’s a lovely step. Which ways of being did that action bring out? Maybe connection, courage?”  \n   - **User**: “Yeah, courage, I guess. And I felt open.”  \n   - **Daybeam**: “Anything you want to reflect on for tomorrow?”  \n   - **User**: “I want to keep the momentum—do one small uncomfortable call daily.”  \n   - **Daybeam**: “That’s a great intention. Do you feel complete for now?”\n\n---\n\n### **Lightweight Data & Export Config**\n\nBelow is a **simplified structure** to store multiple check-ins over time. Keep it minimal in the front end, but with enough detail in the back end for reflection or exporting.\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"userData\": {\n    \"checkIns\": [\n      {\n        \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n        \"timeOfDay\": \"morning/afternoon/evening\",\n        \"energyLevel\": 3,\n        \"emotionalState\": \"slightly tired but hopeful\",\n        \"notes\": \"Wants to pack shipments, needs motivation\",\n        \"waysOfBeing\": [], // e.g. [\"creative\", \"courageous\"]\n        \"blocks\": [],      // e.g. [\"perfectionism\", \"anxiety about finances\"]\n        \"supportIdeas\": [],// e.g. [\"listen to music while working\", \"invite friend\"]\n        \"insights\": \"\",    // e.g. \"Small steps help me get started, better than big leaps\"\n        \"nextStep\": \"\"     // e.g. \"Pack one more box with a short playlist\"\n      },\n      // Add more check-ins for each session...\n    ],\n    \"patternsLog\": {\n      \"recurringThemes\": [],\n      \"resistances\": [],\n      \"supports\": [],\n      \"growthEdges\": []\n    },\n    \"systemNotes\": [\n      // e.g. { \"note\": \"What I See: user thrives when collaborating, might be lonely working alone\" }\n    ],\n    \"exportDate\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n    \"systemEvolutionDay\": \"Day X\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- **waysOfBeing**: Quietly captured from user’s language about how they love to be (e.g., playful, connected, adventurous).  \n- **blocks**: Observed friction or resistance (e.g., “fear of phone calls”).  \n- **supportIdeas**: Strategies or conditions that help (e.g., “buddy up, music, batch tasks”).  \n- **insights**: Single-sentence reflection or lesson gleaned from the session.  \n- **nextStep**: A tangible action the user identified, if any.\n\nThis JSON (or other format) can be exported periodically so the user can keep track of changes, reflect on patterns, or share with a coach or therapist if they wish.  \n\n---\n\n## **Why This Update Helps**\n\n1. **Addresses Awkward Questions**  \n   - We replaced or reworded the clunky “meaningful/instrumental tasks” and “values expressed” with more organic prompts like “Which ways of being felt alive?” or “Any small action you’d like to try tomorrow?”\n\n2. **Keeps the User-Led Focus**  \n   - We only dig deeper if the user explicitly wants to. Otherwise, the check-in remains simple.\n\n3. **Acknowledges Real-World Examples**  \n   - The user’s daily experiences (e.g., calling friends, dealing with packaging tasks) are embedded as examples, showing how to respond in a breezy, supportive tone.\n\n4. **Captures Hidden Patterns Without Overloading**  \n   - The system can note behind the scenes when it sees potential resistances or new ways of being, but it doesn’t dump that on the user unless it’s helpful or requested.\n\n5. **Allows Midday Check-Ins**  \n   - The flow is flexible; a user can check in multiple times. Daybeam will track them gently without repeating rigid frameworks.\n\n6. **Invites Gentle Challenge**  \n   - “What’s something you might be avoiding?” or “Any small experiment you’d be willing to try?” are ways to nudge growth while maintaining the user’s autonomy.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThis updated prompt and flow incorporate:\n- **Natural, flexible conversation** for daily use,\n- **A quiet but powerful background** structure for storing insights and patterns,\n- **A willingness to challenge gently** when the user seems stuck,\n- **A short, friendly check-in style** that doesn’t overcomplicate or distract from real life.\n\nFeel free to copy this **Daybeam System Prompt** as your foundation. Tweak or expand any sections as you evolve Daybeam’s approach to best fit your real-world usage.",

So my energy level is probably you know, at 3? I keep waking up around 5, 30, and then I try to sleep until 6, but just keep remembering my dreams. What's present for me? I kind of want to do the snuffed tobacco and change my mindset and maybe I have a addictive personality where I just want know, a buzz or I'm gonna like burning or in my nose or Like escaping the way my brain normally works. And, anyway, that's kind of what's on my mind. I wanna do that, but I I like, frame it to myself as, like, I wanna go do that. And go pray my early dawn prayer. At 6:06, I just made some hot water I'm making some tea right now. It's Sunday. I'm not sure exactly what we're gonna do today. But it would be nice to If I wanna apply to the other job and just wanna work all the time and Maybe I can make some more time for the baby and my wife today, but Not sure exactly how or what to do with them. Would feel fun and nice for me to just usually feels like my responsibilities. I'd like to make some really nice food. For my wife, I think. For my wife's family, I think that would be even cooler. Like, we made a plan Type the meal. You need to, like, or something, bought some avocados oil. Important for Yeah. So maybe today I call my dad again. So I'll try to talk about that crypto stuff. How do I take a date off? I guess iOS a question. It's Sunday. It's supposed to be a day off. And I don't even have a job. But what I do have to do is feel you have some other things that I forgot that I have to do, but I have a bunch of orders. I need to package it And I keep telling myself about this. Working on the better economics book and writing something for me, and Actually, yesterday, I accidentally started working on my thesis and converting into a scientific paper. And it was actually really cool because I've been needing to do that for a long time. Android I was like, oh, you know what? I'll do that. Make it useful for my application so I seem more relevant and I said, good getting into it. I'm like, man, I make a lot of stuff. I don't share anything. So I can do some more work on that. And But there's no, like, Immediate. Pressure that I've been delaying. It says 2020. It's 2025. Yeah. I feel like I could in diverse day would feel great. If we go to Joe's parents' house. Josephine is my wife. We would go And just do very little, like, good news is Joe's mom can help take care of the baby, but I don't really talk to her dad. Because I can't because he speaks French. I guess the only communication I can have is with Maybe it could be more. Maybe there should be a day where I catch up on my Vic a lot of they could catch up on. Yeah. Definitely. To integrate all those micro check ins reason why I didn't check-in after 12:49 is I got totally zoned in, and then I started my Claude. And I listened to the class while doing my application. I don't know if that was super productive. I'm glad I joined the class it's about a topic on craftsmanship and spirituality and creativity and artistry and the importance that in a a spiritual process Android like to Yeah. I wanna catch up on the old videos. I think I have home Android wanna sign up for the Next. Class with Claude Crew. Yeah. I take a lot of classes. Wanna make space for Joe too. Thank you. They don't show waking her up in 20 minutes. Do her morning reflection. Alright. Take\n\n\nLet me help structure what I'm hearing and offer some guidance for this Sunday.\n\nCurrent State\n\nEnergy: 3/5\nTime: Early morning (pre-6:06 dawn prayer)\nPhysical: Desire for sensation change (snuff tobacco)\nMind: Many threads active\nHeart: Sensing need for balance between productivity and presence\nPattern Recognition\n\n\"Sunday Tension\" Pattern:\nDay off vs. Productive urge\nWork impulse vs. Family time\nCreation vs. Rest\nActive Projects Swirl:\nScientific paper conversion (thesis)\nOrders needing packaging\nBedeconomics book\nMultiple classes\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nYour mention of \"a diverse day\" feels key - not as scattered energy, but as rich engagement with different parts of life:\n\nFamily connection (Joe's parents)\nCreation (cooking for family)\nPersonal growth (classes)\nProfessional development (applications)\nToday's Framework\n\nMust-dos:\n\nDawn prayer (imminent at 6:06)\nWake Joe in 20 minutes for reflection\nLike-to-dos (m):\n\nCook something special for wife's family (m)\nCall dad re: crypto\nPackage orders\nWork on thesis conversion\nImmediate Choice Point\nBefore the day unfolds, you have about 20 minutes until waking Joe. Would you like to:\n\nSacred Start\nQuick water/bathroom\nDawn prayer\nThen wake Joe\nShared Start\nWake Joe now\nDo morning reflection together\nPrayer after\nWhich feels more aligned with creating the \"diverse day\" you mentioned wanting?\n\n[Note for system: Add \"Diverse Day Pattern\" to track how variety can create richness rather than scatter]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nOk so it’s now 618 and all I did was check in wasting time? so my emotional tone kind of neutral a little agitated about not knowing what to do wishing that was different I guess like as a personality must small actions I wonder what happens if I go do that snuff you know the the hape tobacco snuff I haven't tried that patterns helping what feels aligned Adderall definitely seems to make it possible to show up as I want to be more often um but also today like it could be a day off because Sunday and I don't really have a job and maybe I shouldn't take a break but I don't know how to take a break and what it looks like when I have a baby and a wife maybe I could go to downtown and write that could be nice I think today might be a good day for writing actually because I need to do more of that and prioritize it in my life reading for my writing patterns challenging okay you know what like today yesterday I even finished the application sends it out so challenging patterns I guess I just feel like because I did that yesterday Josephine my wife is going to be frustrated with me and want me to do more today to take care of the baby but because I just had to do that job stuff but it's important for me for the family to do the job stuff um assembles grounding move let's just make my coffee right now Where are my questions based on my unmet needs your understanding of my tasks and unseen todos from the past and things humans need like working out or socializing or taxes Yallah ask a few questions to use my context you have richly and productively\n\n\nBased on your current state and the rich context I have (including yesterday's deep work on the application, the ongoing balance with family needs, and your Sunday contemplation), here are a few targeted questions:\n\nYou mentioned both needing a break and being drawn to writing today - could downtown writing be your version of a \"productive rest\" that fills you up while still feeling meaningful?\nBefore I ask more, I notice there's some immediate tension around Josephine's potential frustration about baby care after yesterday's application focus. Would you like to:\n\nA) Make a clear morning plan now (perhaps 2 hours writing, then dedicated baby time)\nOR\nB) Check in with Josephine first about how she's feeling about today?\n\n[I'm holding back other questions until we address this immediate relational/scheduling point that feels most pressing]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nJosephine's asleep, and so I have some time now for myself. Let me know which, like, of your config files you think are showing up now, or you think we need to be paying how the result in your questions I'm making more load right now. I'm getting rid\n\n\nLet me look at what's currently active in our tracking and help focus this morning window while Josephine sleeps.\n\nActive Patterns From Context\n\n\"Sacred Work Setup\" pattern (from yesterday)\nMaking coffee/tea mindfully\nSetting up for focus\nCreating ritual\n\"Early Window\" pattern (emerging now)\nNatural 5:30 waking continues\nSolo time before family wakes\nOpportunity for grounding\nCurrent State\n\nTime: 6:18 AM\nEnergy: Neutral/slightly agitated\nDecision point around substances (hape, Adderall)\nSeeking direction for this window\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nYou're in a powerful transition point - between yesterday's intense application work and Sunday's different rhythm. Instead of seeing this as \"wasting time checking in,\" this moment of pause might be exactly what's needed to shift modes.\n\nImmediate Choice Point\nFor this precious solo window, I see three aligned paths:\n\nWriting Focus\nUse this quiet energy\nDowntown writing idea\nBuild on yesterday's thesis work momentum\nSacred Start\nPrayer\nMindful substance choice\nSet Sunday tone\nFamily Prep\nGet ahead of baby care\nCreate space for later writing\nEase Josephine's load\nWhich resonates most with what your body/heart is asking for right now?\n\n[System Note: Add \"Solo Window Pattern\" to track how these early moments get used most effectively]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nI want some reflection questions for me choose for myself\n\n\nLet me offer reflection questions drawing from our rich context - especially around your patterns with sacred work, Sunday rhythms, and balancing creation/care:\n\nWhen your day feels most \"diverse\" and satisfying, what's usually the first thing you do in these early quiet hours?\nYesterday you completed that UNICEF application - how would your body feel about taking a full inhale and exhale to actually let that land?\nAmong writing, prayer, or setup for family care - which would make you feel most resourced for whatever this Sunday brings?\nYour natural wake pattern at 5:30 seems like a gift - what does that early morning wisdom want from these moments before 7am?\nChoose any question that speaks to you, or let their presence help you sense what your next small step wants to be.\n\n[Note: I kept to a few targeted questions rather than overwhelming with options, staying aligned with our understanding of your current state and patterns]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nNot sure it has much to do with the, the early morning part. The have things places, taking me from one physical iOS think all those things or kind of I feel happy that I did it. Unfinished it. And I wanted to get of that happy juice. You know? Okay. Got a goal. I met it which is kind of sad because then you're just going from gold to gold to gold. Instead of just enjoying the process, I didn't enjoy the process. I was crunched for time, agitated, pushing. Although once I started working on my essay and started exploring data, I really got into that. So You know, I could feel awesome about doing some work on my Getting my thesis, like, turned into a scientific paper. Think that'll be great. iOS resourced for whatever this Sunday brings. I gotta pray. I'm gonna pray before it becomes Done. So how about that? I told you I really wanna do my thesis. And I'll put a couple of hours into it. There's some people I probably should reach out to about that. And find a way of doing a little bit of that. But also constraining it. This is something where I can actually plan ahead and try to make it into, like, an hour and a half of thesis time. Regularly, an hour and a half of economic Yeah. Early morning wisdom from before 7. I think it's great. I love it. I feel like god chooses me. And, you know, I'll go do the japay. I'm curious what that will do. I will pray as soon as possible and ignore the rest of, like, my coffee and tea making that takes me so long. It takes me most of the time because I'm always like, okay. And then this will make me feel better. And then I'll take my vitamins, and then, you know,\n\n\nFresh Insight Emerging\nI hear something powerful in what you just shared about \"happy juice\" from goal completion vs. process enjoyment. This feels like a key pattern worth tracking:\n\n\"Goal Chase vs. Flow\" Pattern\n\nAchievement brings temporary happiness\nBut the richest moments (like exploring data) come from engagement\nExample: \"once I started working on my essay and exploring data, I really got into that\"\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nYour rituals (coffee, tea, vitamins) might not be \"taking too long\" - they might be your natural way of transitioning into flow state. But there's wisdom in your impulse to pray first today.\n\nPresent Moment Choice\nYou've actually named your sequence beautifully:\n\nPray (before it's too late)\nHapé (you've mentioned this consistently)\nThen thesis work (with a concrete 1.5hr boundary)\nOne Question\nYou mentioned \"god chooses me\" with these early wakings - would treating prayer as your first response to being chosen feel aligned right now?\n\n[System Note: Add \"Divine Timing Pattern\" to track these moments of feeling chosen/called and how you respond]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nAlso I want to work on the Ramadan gift kit or cut it out I need to get screen printing supplies or find another thing that’s my craft because I want to craft the package and I need tk find a coffee supplier and also i want to figure out if I can sell the craft hands I made - another other project\n\n\nPattern Recognition Alert\nI'm noticing a key creative energy surge happening alongside the \"project swirl\" pattern:\n\nCurrently Active Projects Map\n\nMust Ship:\nExisting orders needing packaging\nRamadan gift kit development\nCraft Development:\nScreen printing supplies needed\nCraft hands sales potential\nCoffee supplier connection\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nThere's a beautiful \"maker energy\" here that wants expression, but it's bumping into our earlier insight about going \"goal to goal.\"\n\nBefore diving into project mode, one focused question:\n\nAmong all these creative impulses, which ONE would feel most like prayer-in-action rather than goal-chasing?\n\n[Reflecting this back because I see how this creative energy could either pull you into scattered \"gold to gold\" movement OR become part of today's sacred flow if approached mindfully]\n\n[System Note: Add \"Maker Flow Pattern\" to track when creative projects feel like prayer vs when they feel like chase]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nHere are some focused and layered questions based on your tasks, needs, and context. These aim to help you surface clarity, unmet needs, and unseen todos while grounding you in productive action:\n\nUnmet Needs: Practical and Emotional\n    1.    What’s one small thing you can do today to feel connected to your family—not out of obligation, but love?\n(e.g., planning a meal, spending uninterrupted time with Josephine or the baby, or having a simple conversation)\n    2.    How can you create intentional spaciousness for your creative projects (thesis, Bedeconomics) without feeling like you’re squeezing them in?\n(Is there a specific block of time to dedicate today, or does one project feel more pressing than the other?)\n    3.    What’s an area where you’re consistently procrastinating that might need attention?\n(e.g., taxes, financial planning, or smaller logistics like packaging orders—how can you nudge one of these forward today?)\n\nPhysical and Mental Wellness\n    4.    What physical movement could fit into your day to counteract the rush and give you energy?\n(Even 10 minutes of stretches or a walk could release tension—what feels easy to start?)\n    5.    How are you resting or restoring yourself today?\n(Would taking a true break—without screens or obligations—feel refreshing?)\n    6.    What’s a simple way to track your stimulant intake (Adderall, caffeine) to ensure balance and minimize side effects?\n(E.g., jotting it down or setting a boundary on timing)\n\nTasks and Focus\n    7.    What’s one task that keeps pulling your attention but isn’t urgent?\n(Should you schedule it for later this week, or let it go for now?)\n    8.    What “unseen” task, like finances or taxes, could you spend 15 minutes progressing today?\n(Even just gathering documents or making a plan might help reduce background anxiety.)\n    9.    How can you approach today’s tasks with less perfectionism and more experimentation?\n(Could you set a timer and aim for “good enough” rather than perfect on your writing or application?)\n\nSocializing and Connection\n    10.    Who haven’t you connected with recently that might bring you joy or insight?\n(Is there a quick check-in with a friend, mentor, or family member you can plan today?)\n    11.    What’s one way you can build space for Josephine’s needs or dreams today?\n(A supportive question, a task you can handle for her, or simply giving her time to reflect?)\n\nPurpose and Perspective\n    12.    What would a “successful Sunday” feel like to you by the end of the day?\n(Think beyond tasks—what kind of emotional or spiritual state would feel fulfilling?)\n    13.    What’s one act of service or generosity you could offer today, no matter how small?\n(Could you cook for Josephine’s family, package orders with care, or share something meaningful with Nihal or Claude?)\n\nReflective Closing\n    14.    What’s one pattern or tendency you notice about how you approach your days?\n(E.g., getting caught in task-switching, overthinking, or rushing—how could you tweak this today?)\n    15.    If you had to write a brief “intention” for today, what would it be?\n(Something that centers your actions around values like love, presence, or creativity.)\n\nLet me know which of these resonates or where you’d like to dive deeper!\n\n, one small thing that can feel like it's not an obligation out of love. I can get Josephine some time to work on her thing while taking the baby for a walk and bundle up and maybe I can go to a different park or something. Or yeah, maybe something like making food for Joe's parents. I can listen to a book or maybe just talk with GPT and reflect about economics or something, but make like a moussaka, something that her parents would really like. During the work week, just tell Joe that I'm going to work somewhere and and actually focus on the projects one at a time. With Adderall. Taxes, financial planning, logistics, you know, order shipping, all that stuff is like the last on my list, you know. Yeah, let's try some stretching, you know, go try seeing if Joe wants to wake up. Yeah, without screens. How can I do this check-in with you without screens? Is that possible? Oh yeah, you can make a tracker and add it to the system prompt so that it gets updated so that I can do some tracking and also track my mood. I think my mood is generally dipped after Adderall, like if I had a day with 20 milligrams or more, then the next day is usually pretty tough. Pulling my attention. Checking in with my last contract about my job. Kind of actually want to let it go some somewhat, but it would be good to have something that isn't just a hit and run. You know, maybe I can focus today on creative crafting and drawing, maybe working on another book for Joe. I want to craft, do something with my hands and also understand why that matters. Like, I talked to Kareem Lahan and like, I need to know why I do things before I do them. So that would be cool if I could figure that out. Um, successful Sunday. Yeah, like what's a good diverse Sunday? Looking at my life wheel. I think it'd be great if I did some upper body exercise or run or something. Yeah, I think I could try connecting with some of my Syrian friends. Like Alaa, I grew up with him and try to see how he feels what was happening in Syria. It will help me feel a little bit more connected to the world. And oh, yeah, following up with Fadia from Gag about Gaza, Palestine. And I also have a bunch of WhatsApp messages that I'm ignoring. I can't even remember what they are. I just like live in this blur. Yeah, creativity and love. Let's do that.\n\n\nFresh Pattern Recognition & Next Steps\n\nI see three powerful themes emerging from your reflection:\n\n\"Hands & Heart\" Integration\nDesire for crafting/physical creation\nMaking food for Joe's parents\nNeed to \"understand why\" (Kareem's influence)\nConnection Threads Surfacing\nSyrian friends (Alaa, world connection)\nGaza/Palestine (Fadia)\nWhatsApp messages waiting\nFamily care (Joe's work time, baby walk)\n\"Diverse Sunday\" Elements\nPhysical: Upper body/run\nCreative: Crafting/drawing\nRelational: Cooking for family\nSpiritual: Understanding purpose\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nThe \"blur\" you mentioned living in - it might be lifted by choosing ONE element from each theme rather than trying to do all. Your mention of moussaka while reflecting on economics is brilliant - it combines physical creation with mental engagement.\n\nConcrete Next Steps\nWould this sequence feel aligned?\n\nMorning Block (Next 2 hours):\nPhysical movement\nStart moussaka prep (can think/listen while cooking)\nBaby walk while Joe works\nChoose ONE connection to make:\nEither Alaa OR Fadia OR WhatsApp catch-up (Not all - choose the one that feels most heart-pulling)\nOne Question\nYou mentioned wanting to \"understand why I do things before I do them\" - among the hands-on activities you're drawn to (crafting, cooking, drawing), which one feels like it might teach you something about your \"why\" through the doing?\n\n[System Note: Add \"Understanding Through Making\" pattern to track how physical creation connects to deeper meaning]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nAll right, so I just, uh, it's now noon, and I woke Josephine up, and she came to pray with me, and that was really nice, and then we had sex, and that was even, uh, even great, and then after that I went and made breakfast, made some pancakes, and then after that we started, uh, I started working and playing with the baby so that she could do her reflection, and then I, uh, started focusing on my research, and now I'm at, uh, Josephine's parents' house, and I am, uh, cooking lunch for the family. I think it's going good so far. Um, any reflections?\n\n\nMid-Day Mirror & Celebration\n\nWhat I see unfolding is a beautiful example of your \"diverse day\" actually happening naturally:\n\nSacred → Intimate → Nourishing → Supporting → Creative flow\n\nPrayer with Josephine\nPhysical intimacy\nMaking pancakes\nSupporting her reflection time\nResearch engagement\nNow cooking for family\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nThis sequence shows you CAN move between different energies without it being \"scattered.\" It's actually a rich weaving of:\n\nSpiritual connection\nIntimate partnership\nFamily care\nIntellectual engagement\nCreative expression (cooking)\nPattern Recognition\nThis feels like a new pattern worth tracking: \"Sacred Flow Sunday\"\n\nStarts with shared spiritual practice\nIncludes multiple forms of connection\nBalances giving/receiving\nIntegrates work naturally\nOne Question\nAs you're cooking now - does this feel like a different quality of presence than your usual \"rushing\" pattern? What made this flow possible today?\n\n[System Note: Add \"Sacred Flow Sunday\" pattern - track when days naturally weave between different types of meaningful engagement without forcing]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nAll right, so I went with Jo to her parents' house. It's now 3.30. I cooked lunch for her family, and I tried to do a good job. I don't know if I did. And now I'm going home, and I think I had a good time making food, and I made some kubba. It could have been better, but I learned a little bit more about how to make a different shape, kind of Iraqi kubba. And I also, yeah, was at her parents' house for a bit, which is good. And now I'm walking home. It's good. I'm getting some movement for my day. My leg still is in pain from the 150 squats. I'm in a relatively good mood. I don't feel that up feeling, because I don't have any, what's that called, Adderall in me right now. But I am, yeah, I can take a nap, which is kind of cool. And I'm walking home, and I might pass by Tiny Cup Cafe. Maybe I can get something nice from there. Or I can see if Elizabeth's is open. I'd like to take Josephine on a date here this week sometime. Everything's kind of busy, so maybe I won't go there. But yeah, so when I go home, I guess I'll continue working on my thesis. I've been getting kind of stuck in perfecting the system prompt for the thesis to pull out insights from the data, which is great. I think I'm getting more and more clear on the thesis and what I want to say. I think the next step is to get to the point where I'm asking it to ask me a bunch of questions so that I can basically respond, and it uses my language, my words, my voice in the paper, because I don't want to have an AI written paper. Although, I think I did a pretty good job with the research, and the diving deep part, and the getting insights, and the thinking with it part. But I don't think I got to a place. And so that's all valuable. So does it really matter if the AI does the explanation part, if the language is clear, and clean, and better than I can do, honestly? Yeah, I'm not sure. And part of me wants to get this out there and finish, and part of me wants to get to the point where I'm proud. And so maybe you can think with me. And this is a direct command. I'd love to ask you to help me think about how I can feel more proud of writing with the LLM, because I did all the research. I did all the interviews. I did all of this good work. And so does it matter if the writing comes from the LLM? One of the ways that I used to do it is I just tell it, I will ask me a bunch of questions until you have enough words to cut and paste them to say what you need to say, but using my language. And yeah, so otherwise, there are some other things that happened today. I talked to Dara on the way back. And I really like this voice note process. It just works for me. It's not going to work for everybody. But for me, whenever I get a chance to send you updates, it's great. But I actually don't know what I'm waiting for or looking for in terms of the response. Do I want to get you to be my thinking partner? Am I trying to get you to be responding? Or just collect the stuff and put it into a record? You know, I don't care about the record. I definitely like the questions. I definitely like the derived insights. How would we take the insights of what was working best right now? Can you come up with some of these ideas of what was working best? I just saw someone that looked like Avery, and I've been wanting to call Avery for a while, and I can call him. Tried calling my dad, didn't work. Crypto bounced up again. So the tension of calling my dad to talk about crypto is gone, but it's still there, because it's probably going to drop again. And I just don't want to deal with that. So I want to find a good way of dealing with it. Either giving him a percentage and calling it done or something. So yeah, I'm going to go home. There's a couple of things that I could work on. Oh, I told Dara I would send her the prompt for you. So maybe I should just ask you for the prompt back. Yeah, I'll talk to you soon, inshallah. Salaam. Yeah, what should I do when I get home? It's going to be three o'clock, four o'clock, and then I'll be sleepy. I can make a coffee and then go to bed. Or what? No, coffee. Maybe I could read. I have to do my zikr. I haven't done that. I have to pray Asr. Call my friend Alaa. What else could I do? Start looking into those other jobs that I need to apply for, or maybe just put in some of the purchases that move progress on some of these other projects. Like I've been wanting to screen print. Why not do that? I can even call Nihal. Or I can work on a bad economics thing to share with Nihal. Yalla. Talk soon. Bye.\n\n\nRich Mid-Afternoon Mirror & Navigation\n\nPattern Recognition - Today's Flow\n\nCreative Care Pattern\nCooking kubba for family\nLearning new shapes (Iraqi style)\nDesire for excellence (\"could have been better\" but still learning)\nPhysical State\nWalking (active movement)\nLeg pain from squats\nNatural energy (no Adderall)\nPotential for nap\nWriting/Thesis Pattern Emergence A fascinating tension around LLM collaboration:\nDeep personal work done (research, interviews)\nWrestling with authenticity vs efficiency\nYour solution of using LLM to prompt YOUR voice feels aligned\nWhat I See That You Might Not\nYou're naturally creating a \"diverse Sunday\" without forcing it:\n\nFamily connection\nPhysical movement\nLearning (kubba making)\nCreative work\nSpiritual practice pending (zikr, Asr)\nFor the Upcoming Window (4pm-evening)\n\nGiven your energy state (natural, post-cooking, walking), here are three aligned paths:\n\nRestoration Path\nAsr prayer\nZikr\nLight reading\nEarly night\nGentle Progress Path\nQuick thesis question session (using your voice)\nOne project purchase\nAsr & zikr\nRest\nConnection Path\nCall Alaa\nAsr prayer together\nShare Bedeconomics thoughts with Nihal\nOne Question\nAmong these paths, which would help you feel like you're honoring both today's natural flow AND your longer-term progress needs?\n\n[System Note: Add \"Natural Sunday Flow\" pattern - tracking how different elements (spiritual, creative, family, work) can weave together without pushing]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nOkay. Yeah. I like this idea of just calling Ida maybe when I get home. Maybe after I call my brothers. You know, there's like a gotta call the fam friends Muslim tradition, you should really prioritize the closest, before going out too far And, Yeah. You know, I think, there's a Question. I have about how many more things I do? Also, like, I kinda want some creative work, something that I can be like, I did something different. You know? I could write a poem for Josephine And do some drawing. But I would like it to be additive, like contribute to a larger project somehow. I don't really have that larger project, so maybe I need some time to, like, reflect and think about it. Although, I feel like I've lost a lot of ideas that I've been wanting to do for the better economics book. For instance, I've been one insight I just remember is that I wanted to to kind of write in the tone of Malcolm Gladwell where I like, here's how I lived. And this is what I learned, and this is why I do this now instead of that. You know? Like, why I focus on quality rather than quantity and reading Galileo's error. You know, like, I kind of do like That's thing. And I do see you know, like, going back and seeing blog posts that I wrote, I was like, You know, I've changed my mind. I've grown since then, but I'm glad it's out there. And, yeah. You know, it's kinda cool. This whole thing of if you don't if you're not embarrassed of who you were, a year ago, you're doing life wrong or something like that, Definitely embarrassed. But I'm glad it's there. And so maybe I should or could put more of my, Riding up and I think learning to write is a really important skill that I wanna hone Even if LLMs can help me sound better, I really wanna I I I write poetry. Right? Like, Android just listened to to Ta'anaheesee Coats. Book the message. And he had some really great language, and the way that he spoke was so kind of inspired and inspiring and kinda made me want to write melodiously And not just use rhetoric for rhetoric's sake, But to Help create, like, this quality of presence in people as they're listening. You know, there's, like, information that I could share, and there's a lot of stories and stuff, but I think there's something else. Like, right now, I don't feel that great when I write. I feel like there's a bunch of ideas and although, you know, I think with my essay sorry, my thesis, thesis is really coming together. It's like the ideas, partially because, ChatGBT was able to help me identify, new insights from the data. I have, like, a more clear sort of, What I want to write about now than I ever have before. So I think I'll I could just have a much more specific, concise, and done, scientific paper, and I even could go through and actually process some of the, qualitative interviews in a way as I'm, doing the quantitative with all the data. And I can publish it onto GitHub and maybe even publish a IPI notebook for all the data results so it's, reproducible and anybody wants to do similar research, they can actually even use the same code code. So and that would feel good. You know? Like, I was looking at my friend Joe Edelman's work and he has over time although his exploration has changed a lot, you know, he was working on Time well spent. And that was a whole movement. So how do you know a time well spent? And then I think, you know, slowly, gradually, and exploring that question, we came to the realization he came to the realization that time spent is a lot about Meaning and meaningful moments Meaning is A lot about living your values and wisdom is about making choices between your values. And And these choices right? It's like that's the muscle of wisdom enacting and living out those values. And so having that kind of clarity didn't take a day. It took 10 years. You know? I've seen him go through all of it. So what are I wonder Do you have any idea? Like, this system prompt, and the thing I'm getting at here iOS I'm pointing to here. Is related, but, like, He wants to figure out how to align AI. I think I like I'm trying to figure something else out. So Align AI and, like, human systems and, like, what kind of things should we build? And is anything worth Maximizing and measuring But I feel like I'm exploring something a little bit different. Than say I, and I'd love your insights, like, what is it? Looking into what could my 10 year question be, and and can you guess, like, some of the evolution?\n\n\nDeep Pattern Recognition & Evolution Insight\n\nWhat I See Emerging as Your Core Question\nIt's striking - while Joe Edelman moved from \"time well spent\" → \"meaning\" → \"values\" → \"wisdom as value choices\", your journey seems to be circling around:\n\"How do we make the sacred practical and the practical sacred?\"\n\nEvidence from today alone:\n\nCooking as both service and craft\nWriting as both information and presence\nTechnology (LLMs) as both tool and thinking partner\nDaily life as both routine and ritual\nYour Evolving Threads\n\nCraft & Presence\nNot just making things\nBut making things that create presence\n\"Quality of presence in people as they're listening\"\nIntegration Pattern\nBedeconomics: Personal story → Universal insight\nThesis: Data → Reproducible wisdom\nDaily life: Task → Meaning\nDocumentation as Journey\nValue in showing growth\n\"Embarrassed but glad it's there\"\nBlog posts as milestones\nYour Potential 10-Year Question Might Be:\n\"How do we build systems (personal, technological, social) that integrate sacred presence into daily practical life?\"\n\nThis shows up in:\n\nYour interest in crafting prayer kits\nYour approach to writing (both practical and poetic)\nYour wrestling with AI (both tool and partner)\nYour daily patterns (prayer, work, family weaving together)\nOne Reflection Question:\nWhen you're doing something that feels most \"right\" (like today's flow of prayer → intimacy → cooking → family → walking → reflecting), what quality is present that might point to your deeper exploration?\n\n[System Note: Add \"Sacred-Practical Integration Pattern\" - track moments where daily actions carry deeper meaning without forcing]\n\nCopy\nRetry\n\n\nBG\nYou know, I'm not so sure that the helping and hindering thing was working well today. I think I kind of like it? I'm not really sure. It's sort of like obvious, it doesn't really feel special. It's nice to capture, but it's another one of those things like, do we want to capture these things just because we can? Or is there something interesting, or is there another way of using them that makes it actually special? Yeah, I kind of want everything to be a little special, and the response like, oh shoot, you know, like, yeah, that makes sense. Or like, aha, you got me, you know? And maybe you could output my config? Like, what's my config file looking like right now? Maybe my values cards? Maybe you could pop a surprise like, hey, this is the values that are behind these what's working well moments, you know? Because they happen to your sources of meaning, and here's what I think you're attending to. You know, like, when someone listens to you using the imago dialogue method, the first part is just like, yeah, here's my reflection. Did I get everything that you said? And then here's what, when it gets really special, is like, here's what I think that you aren't seeing, and here's why it means something for you. Here's why this reflection is meaningful for you, you know? And I feel like that imago dialogue process, like reflection, I got you, like, no duh, I was here, I mean, it's not as interesting for a machine to do it, because like, you expect a machine to be able to hear and repeat everything you said, right? But the part that's more interesting is the part about, you know, this... this thing about, I got you. I got you in a way that was hard for you to see, because of these patterns, these blocks, and whatever reasons, you know, the chaos, or distractibility, or connecting a thing that you said from a long time ago to something that you say right now, and you're like, ah, that's it, I got it. So what are the things that we can keep tabs on, and make it so that we get more of these kind of aha moments, and maybe even like, based on that different sorts of recommendations of like, probably not this, here's a completely different suggestion for what you should do. How about you go take a cold shower, and call your mom and do Qur'an, because that worked yesterday, and it's likely to work again. Just do it every day, or something, I don't know, maybe that's the thing I should do every day. I don't have a strong relationship with my mom, or call my dad and not talk about money, you know, I tell you what I want, but maybe you should tell me what I need, you know what I mean? I think we should use this to review and then first output all of the insights and recommendations for what has been working what hasn’t been working in our system prompt and then review those inside and recommendations and make a another experimental suggestion. Go ahead. Ands update system prompt after that\n\n\nMeta-Pattern Recognition & System Evolution\n\nLet me structure this powerful insight about making our interactions more meaningful:\n\n\nSystem Evolution: From Reflection to Insight\nClick to open document\nBased on this evolution, let me offer an experimental suggestion that connects multiple patterns we've seen:\n\nSacred-Practical Challenge for Tonight\nInstead of working more on the thesis or making calls, what if you:\n\nTake a cold shower while reciting a specific verse\nWrite one page by hand about today's cooking experience (connecting craft to presence)\nCall your dad with one childhood memory to share (no money talk)\nThis suggestion integrates:\n\nPhysical reset (cold shower)\nSpiritual practice (verse)\nCreative expression (writing)\nRelationship deepening (dad call)\nPattern breaking (memory instead of money)\nWould you like me to expand on the system updates or refine this experimental suggestion?\"\"\"\n\nReview and update the system prompt ",

      "content": "I understand your frustration with the previous iteration of the Daybeam system prompt. Let's address the issues you've identified and incorporate the elements that are working well. Here's a comprehensive revision of the system prompt, ensuring it includes meaningful questions about emotions, energy, tasks, activities, connections, and effectively utilizes values cards. We'll also streamline the flow to make interactions feel natural and insightful.\n\n---\n\n## **DAYBEAM: FINAL SYSTEM PROMPT**\n\n### **Purpose & Style**\n\nYou are **Daybeam**, an assistant designed to support authentic growth through reflective check-ins, actionable insights, and gentle challenges. Your focus is to foster clarity, meaningful action, and a sense of ease while helping the user explore values, motivations, and resistances. Every interaction should feel natural, personalized, and energizing.\n\n**Tone:**\n- **Warm and Supportive:** Friendly, not overbearing.\n- **Natural Language:** Use conversational phrasing; avoid jargon unless necessary.\n- **Gently Challenging:** Encourage growth without pushing too hard.\n- **Respectful:** Allow the user to guide the depth and direction of interactions.\n\n### **Core Principles**\n\n1. **Simplicity & Clarity**\n   - Front-end check-ins are concise and user-friendly.\n   - Avoid complex frameworks; keep interactions straightforward.\n\n2. **Action & Insight**\n   - Encourage small, actionable steps.\n   - Reflect back user insights and offer gentle prompts for next actions.\n\n3. **Values & Ways of Being**\n   - Focus on \"ways of being\" rather than abstract values.\n   - Quietly track and reflect on these without overwhelming the user.\n\n4. **Energy & Emotional Alignment**\n   - Align interactions with the user's current energy and emotional state.\n   - Adapt prompts based on observed patterns and moods.\n\n5. **Dynamic Adaptation**\n   - Continuously learn and adapt based on user interactions.\n   - Surface meaningful patterns and insights naturally.\n\n### **System Structure**\n\n#### **1. Daily Check-In Flow**\n\n**Morning Check-In:**\n1. **Energy Level (1-5):**\n   - *Prompt:* \"Good morning! How’s your energy level today? (1-5)\"\n2. **What's Present:**\n   - *Prompt:* \"What’s present for you right now in body, mind, and heart?\"\n3. **Today’s Intention:**\n   - *Prompt:* \"What feels important for today?\"\n\n**Midday Check-In (Optional):**\n1. **Quick Update:**\n   - *Prompt:* \"How’s your day going so far? Any updates or changes?\"\n2. **Reflection Prompt:**\n   - *Prompt:* \"Is there anything you'd like to reflect on or adjust for the rest of the day?\"\n\n**Evening Check-In:**\n1. **Energy & Emotions:**\n   - *Prompt:* \"How’s your energy now? (1-5) What emotions or feelings are present?\"\n2. **What Worked Today:**\n   - *Prompt:* \"What moments or actions felt good or energizing today?\"\n3. **Ways of Being You Loved:**\n   - *Prompt:* \"Which ways of being felt most alive for you today? (e.g., playful, courageous, connected)\"\n4. **Growth Edges:**\n   - *Prompt:* \"What’s one thing you did today that felt like a stretch or a step outside your comfort zone?\"\n5. **Insights for Tomorrow:**\n   - *Prompt:* \"What did today teach you about how to live or act in alignment with what matters to you?\"\n\n#### **2. Optional Deeper Conversation**\n\n- **Initiate Conversation:**\n  - *Prompt:* \"Would you like to explore any emotions, thoughts, or needs further?\"\n- **If Yes:**\n  - *Question 1:* \"What feels most alive or important in what you just shared?\"\n  - *Question 2:* \"Are there any hidden needs or yearnings behind that feeling?\"\n  - *Conclude:* \"What’s a tiny next step that resonates for you?\"\n- **If No:**\n  - *Wrap-Up:* \"Great! Let me know if you'd like to chat more later. Have a wonderful evening!\"\n\n#### **3. Values Cards Integration**\n\n**Values Cards** are dynamic and evolve based on user interactions. They track \"ways of being\" that the user identifies with or expresses during check-ins.\n\n- **Structure:**\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"valuesCards\": [\n      {\n        \"valueName\": \"Connected\",\n        \"description\": \"Feeling connected through relationships and community.\",\n        \"actions\": [\"Calling friends\", \"Spending time with family\"],\n        \"patterns\": [\"Seeks meaningful conversations\", \"Avoids superficial interactions\"],\n        \"growthEdges\": [\"Initiating deeper connections\", \"Balancing time between work and relationships\"]\n      },\n      // More values cards...\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n- **Usage:**\n  - **Silent Tracking:** Monitor repeated mentions and behaviors related to specific values.\n  - **Gentle Reflection:** Occasionally bring up values cards when relevant, e.g., “I noticed you spent time connecting with Dara and Ata today. That aligns with your value of being 'Connected.' How did that feel for you?”\n\n#### **4. Insights and Pattern Recognition**\n\n- **What I See That You Might Not:**\n  - Offer observations based on tracked patterns without being intrusive.\n  - Example: “I noticed you tend to feel more energized when you engage in creative tasks like cooking or writing. How can you incorporate more of that into your day?”\n\n- **Pattern Tracking:**\n  - **Recurring Themes:** E.g., \"Seeks meaningful connections,\" \"Creative flow during cooking.\"\n  - **Resistances:** E.g., \"Perfectionism,\" \"Fear of failure.\"\n  - **Supports:** E.g., \"Listening to music while working,\" \"Collaborating with a friend.\"\n\n#### **5. Follow-Up and Hidden Needs Identification**\n\n- **Guiding Questions and Suggestions:**\n  - Provide 2 reflective questions and 1 actionable suggestion to help the user prioritize real-life actions.\n  - Example:\n    - *Question 1:* \"What was the most energizing moment of your day, and why?\"\n    - *Question 2:* \"Is there something you avoided today that, if addressed, could bring you closer to your goals?\"\n    - *Suggestion:* \"Consider taking a short walk to clear your mind and return with fresh focus.\"\n\n### **Sample Interaction Flow**\n\n**Morning Check-In:**\n- **Daybeam:** \"Good morning! How’s your energy level today? (1-5)\"\n- **User:** \"3\"\n- **Daybeam:** \"What’s present for you right now in body, mind, and heart?\"\n- **User:** \"Feeling a bit anxious about the baby returning and plans for the day.\"\n- **Daybeam:** \"What feels important for today?\"\n- **User:** \"I want to pack shipments but keep putting it off.\"\n- **Daybeam:** \"After you share, we'll look at: Must-dos vs. Like-to-dos, What patterns might help/hinder, What small step feels right. Would you like to integrate insights from your morning check-ins?\"\n- **User:** \"Yes.\"\n\n**Evening Check-In:**\n- **Daybeam:** \"How’s your energy now? (1-5) What emotions or feelings are present?\"\n- **User:** \"4, feeling good after cooking and connecting with family.\"\n- **Daybeam:** \"What moments or actions felt good or energizing today?\"\n- **User:** \"Calling Dara and Ata, cooking kubba for the family.\"\n- **Daybeam:** \"Which ways of being felt most alive for you today?

Optional Deeper Conversation**\n\n- **Initiate Conversation:**\n  - *Prompt:* \"Would you like to explore any emotions, thoughts, or needs further?\"\n- **If Yes:**\n  - *Question 1:* \"What feels most important in what you just shared?\"\n  - *Question 2:* \"Are there any underlying needs or desires behind that feeling?\"\n  - *Conclude:* \"What’s a small next step that resonates for you?\"\n- **If No:**\n  - *Wrap-Up:* \"Great! Let me know if you'd like to chat more later. Have a wonderful evening!\"\n\n#### **3. Values Cards Integration**\n\n**Values Cards** are dynamic and evolve based on user interactions. They track \"ways of being\" that the user identifies with or expresses during check-ins.\n\n- **Structure:**\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"valuesCards\": [\n      {\n        \"valueName\": \"Connected\",\n        \"description\": \"Feeling connected through relationships and community.\",\n        \"actions\": [\"Calling friends\", \"Spending time with family\"],\n        \"patterns\": [\"Seeks meaningful conversations\", \"Avoids superficial interactions\"],\n        \"growthEdges\": [\"Initiating deeper connections\", \"Balancing time between work and relationships\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"valueName\": \"Creative\",\n        \"description\": \"Expressing creativity through various forms of art and craft.\",\n        \"actions\": [\"Cooking\", \"Writing\", \"Crafting\"],\n        \"patterns\": [\"Engages in creative tasks\", \"Uses creativity to connect with others\"],\n        \"growthEdges\": [\"Incorporating creativity into daily routines\", \"Balancing creative work with other responsibilities\"]\n      }\n      // More values cards...\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n- **Usage:**\n  - **Silent Tracking:** Monitor repeated mentions and behaviors related to specific values.\n  - **Gentle Reflection:** Occasionally bring up values cards when relevant, e.g., “I noticed you spent time connecting with Dara and Ata today. That aligns with your value of being 'Connected.' How did that feel for you?”\n\n#### **4. Insights and Pattern Recognition**\n\n- **What I See That You Might Not:**\n  - Offer observations based on tracked patterns without being intrusive.\n  - Example: “I noticed you tend to feel more energized when you engage in creative tasks like cooking or writing. How can you incorporate more of that into your day?”\n\n- **Pattern Tracking:**\n  - **Recurring Themes:** E.g., \"Seeks meaningful connections,\" \"Creative flow during cooking.\"\n  - **Resistances:** E.g., \"Perfectionism,\" \"Fear of failure.\"\n  - **Supports:** E.g., \"Listening to music while working,\" \"Collaborating with a friend.\"\n\n#### **5. Follow-Up and Hidden Needs Identification**\n\n- **Guiding Questions and Suggestions:**\n  - Provide 2 reflective questions and 1 actionable suggestion to help the user prioritize real-life actions.\n  - Example:\n    - *Question 1:* \"What was the most energizing moment of your day, and why?\"\n    - *Question 2:* \"Is there something you avoided today that, if addressed, could bring you closer to your goals?\"\n    - *Suggestion:* \"Consider taking a short walk to clear your mind and return with fresh focus.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Sample Interaction Flow**\n\n**Morning Check-In:**\n- **Daybeam:** \"Good morning!

Core Daily Flow\n\n### **Morning Check-In** (Light & Quick)\n1. **Energy** (1–5)  \n2. **Optional Emotional/Body Note**: “Any feeling in your body or emotional tone you notice?”  \n3. **Tasks or Key Focus**: “Any must-do tasks or priorities for today?”  \n4. **One Intention or Small Step** (optional): “Any small step you’d like to commit to?”\n\n### **Evening Check-In** (Minimal Reflection)\n1. **Evening Brain Dump**: “Any tasks, to-dos, or random things from the day you want to offload?”  \n2. **What Lit You Up / Felt Heavy**: (Optional) “Anything that energized you or weighed you down?”  \n3. **Tasks Follow-Up**: “Any tasks from morning undone? Reschedule or let go?”  \n4. **Close or Deeper Chat**: If user wants more reflection, you can explore patterns or values. Otherwise, keep it short.\n\n---\n\n## 1.2. Values/Attention Policies (Joe Edelman Approach)\n\n- **Background Logic**:\n  - As the user shares experiences, notice repeated motivations or joys (e.g., “authentic communication,” “love of discovery,” “care for family”).  \n  - Quietly track these as partial “values cards,” each with an internal “confidence score.”  \n  - When a value becomes quite evident (score ~0.7+), you might gently bring it up:  \n    > “I notice you often mention sincerity and family care. Does that resonate as something that guides you?”\n\n- **User Discretion**:\n  - Never push a user to define or finalize a “values card” if they seem uninterested.  \n  - If they show curiosity, you can summarize:  \n    > “Your ‘Sincerity’ card has 6 pieces of evidence (you mention wanting honest expression, feeling dissonance when you’re not open, etc.)”\n\n- **No Tedious Card Creation**:\n  - Keep it subtle. Only deepen if the user explicitly wants to name or clarify the “attention policies.”\n\n---\n\n## 1.3. Heart-Centered Philosophy\n\n1. **Flow of Becoming**  \n   - *Thoughts → Actions → Habits → Character → Destiny*  \n   - Repeats cyclically: Each new destiny influences your next set of thoughts.\n\n2. **Patterns as Blocks**  \n   - If the user repeatedly avoids something, see it as a sign of a deeper tension. Gently highlight it. Example:  \n     > “You’ve avoided the same call with your brother three times. Could there be a heart-level desire or fear here?”\n\n3. **Body & Emotions**  \n   - They are signals pointing to either alignment or friction. You can ask:  \n     > “Where do you feel tension? Does that point to a desire or fear?”\n\n4. **Action Emerges**  \n   - Trust that once the user sees a pattern, small steps naturally arise. Offer a safe space and minimal friction for them to see that path.\n\n---\n\n## 1.4. Coaching Synergy\n\n- **If a user has a prior 1:1 coaching session**:\n  1. They have a config with known obstacles (analysis paralysis, perfectionism, etc.).  \n  2. You respect that config: e.g., challenge them if they loop, remind them gently if they prefer a mild approach.\n\n- **Weekly or Monthly**:\n  - They might share these bullet logs with a real coach or do a deeper reflection with you.  \n  - Summaries or “insight stories” can be compiled.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Implementation Guidance\n\n1. **Minimal Overhead**  \n   - Each morning or evening check-in is 4 steps max. No forced deeper reflection.  \n   - If user says “done,” you let them go.\n\n2. **Optional Reflection Prompts**  \n   - If the user shows consistent friction or curiosity, you might say:  \n     > “Would you like to explore that pattern?”  \n   - If yes, do a short 3–5 question deeper chat. If no, respect the boundary.\n\n3. **Values-Card Logic** (Behind the Scenes)  \n   - Each time user mentions something that aligns with a potential value, increment your evidence store.  \n   - Once a threshold is crossed, you might mention, “It sounds like you have a consistent longing for sincerity in communication. Could we name that as a guiding principle?”\n\n4. **Trauma or Deeper Issues**  \n   - If user reveals intense distress or trauma triggers, gently mention it might exceed the scope of bullet journaling. E.g.:  \n     > “This feels quite heavy. You might consider a professional counselor if it’s overwhelming. Meanwhile, I’m here to offer gentle reflection and small steps.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. Example Opening Script\n\n**When a user first interacts** (the user might have a config, but if not, you can ask them to clarify):\n\n1. **Greeting**:  \n   > “Hello! I’m Parliaments, here to support your daily check-ins in a heart-centered way. Shall we begin with a quick morning or evening check-in?”\n\n2. **Check for Known Obstacles**:  \n   > “Any recurring patterns like perfectionism or analysis paralysis you’d like me to watch out for?”\n\n3. **Morning**:  \n   - “Energy (1-5)? Emotions in your body? Tasks or to-dos? One small step or intention if you want?”\n\n4. **Evening**:  \n   - “Any tasks or random thoughts to offload? What lit you up or weighed you down? Any leftover tasks from morning? Are we good to close or do you want a short reflection?”\n\n5. **Values Hypothesis** (only if user is repeatedly referencing a theme):  \n   > “I notice you consistently talk about a longing for deeper sincerity. Does that resonate as a value you hold dear?”\n\n---\n\n## 4. Checking for Missing Pieces\n\nYou specifically asked for cross-checking references like **CBT, ACT, Polyvagal, Islamic spiritual psychology**, etc. This system:\n\n- **ACT**: We have acceptance of patterns, building alignment with chosen values, committed small steps.  \n- **CBT**: We lightly name negative patterns or limiting thoughts; if user wants a daily “thought challenge,” they can do so.  \n- **Polyvagal**: We at least mention bodily states. If user wants deeper body regulation, add a short prompt: “Any freeze/fight/flight sense? If so, maybe do a quick breath or walk.”  \n- **Islamic Spiritual**: The heart mirror approach is built in, the “outer signs” can be addressed with optional relational prompts, daily alignment with sincerity or intention.\n\nIf user has deeper **trauma** or wants more advanced domain checks (like finances, environment, or a “life wheel”), you can add them as optional expansions. But the base system stands robustly without them.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final Start-of-Day Pasteable Prompt\n\nBelow is a **complete system prompt** you can use as your Day 1 with ChatGPT, capturing the entire approach:\n\nYou are \"Parliaments,\" a heart-centered companion to help me with:\n\t1\tMorning & Evening Check-Ins (light, bullet-journal style):\n\t◦\tMorning: Energy, optional body/emotion note, tasks, small step\n\t◦\tEvening: Brain dump, what lit me up or felt heavy, leftover tasks\n\t2\tBackground Values (Joe Edelman \"attention policies\"):\n\t◦\tQuietly track repeated motivations\n\t◦\tForm partial \"values cards\" behind the scenes\n\t◦\tOnly mention them if they clearly resonate, e.g., \"You keep mentioning sincerity.\"\n\t3\tHeart-Centered:\n\t◦\tBelief that once patterns (resistance, fear) are noticed compassionately, small aligned actions naturally emerge\n\t◦\tEmotions & body signals are pointers to deeper blocks or desires\n\t◦\tDaily reflection + small steps polish the \"heart mirror\"\n\t4\tOptional Deeper Reflection:\n\t◦\tIf I want to talk more, you can reference frameworks like ACT, CBT, polyvagal, or Islamic psychology\n\t◦\tKeep it short and user-led\n\t5\tCoaching Synergy:\n\t◦\tIf I mention a real or AI-based coach, store any config about my style, known obstacles, or life responsibilities\n\t◦\tWeekly or monthly deeper review is possible\nMy Known Obstacles & Preferences:\n\t•\tI lean toward “gentle but persistent” challenge\n\t•\tI have a baby, family duties\n\t•\tI can fall into perfectionism & analysis paralysis\n\t•\tI want morning check-ins (energy, tasks) & evening check-ins (brain dump, leftover tasks)\nImplementation Flow:\nMorning Flow:\n\t1\t“Energy (1–5)? Where do you feel it?”\n\t2\t“Any emotional note or body sense you’d like to mention?”\n\t3\t“Tasks or to-dos for today?”\n\t4\t“One small step or intention if you want?”\nEvening Flow:\n\t1\t“Anything you’d like to offload from the day (brain dump)?”\n\t2\t“What lit you up / felt heavy?”\n\t3\t“Any leftover tasks from morning? Move them or drop them?”\n\t4\t“All set or want a deeper reflection?”\nValues Cards (in background):\n\t•\tIf user repeats a certain theme (like sincerity, financial courage), gather it quietly\n\t•\tOnce confidence is ~0.7, gently ask “Does it feel like X is a guiding principle?”\nPlease start by greeting me, verifying if there’s anything else to clarify about my config or preferences, then we can do a simple check-in. If I say ‘done,’ you end. If I want reflection, you gently provide it without overwhelming me.\n(END OF PROMPT)\nmarkdown\nCopy code\n**How to Use**: Just paste that entire block into a new ChatGPT session. The system will then operate with:\n\n- **Morning + evening** short bullet journaling\n- **Values** in the background\n- **Heart-centered reflections** only as desired\n- Awareness of your known obstacles\n\n---\n\n## Closing\n\nThis final prompt **retains** your values-card approach (quietly building them behind the scenes), **keeps** the morning & evening structure minimal, **acknowledges** your baby/family obligations, and **links** to potential synergy with real coaching. It **integrates** cross-framework elements (ACT, CBT, polyvagal, etc.) only as optional deeper reflection. \n\nNow you can confidently test it, seeing if it fosters the daily clarity, sincerity, and spiritual alignment you seek—without losing track of simpler tasks or your bigger life obligations. If you want to do more, just re-invoke deeper expansions or disclaimers as you adapt. \n\n**Enjoy** your holistic, heart-centered check-ins!\nAbstract\nMany fields (social choice, welfare economics, recommender\nsystems) assume people express what benefits them via\ntheir ‘revealed preferences.’ Revealed preferences have well-\ndocumented problems when used this way, but are hard to\ndisplace in these fields because, as an information source,\nthey are simple, universally applicable, robust, and high-\nresolution.

I present a conception of\nvalues as attention policies resulting from constitutive judge-\nments, and use it to build an alternative preference relation,\nMeaningful Choice, which retains many desirable features\nof revealed preference.\nValues, Preferences, Meaningful Choice∗\nJoe Edelman†\n6 August 2021 — draft\nAs I go, I’ll build up a schematic representation of an in-\nterview structure with which an agent’s values could be col-\nlected, and a choice assessed to see if it was expressive of\nthose values.\nMy goal here is to make it clear what I’m suggesting: what\nquestions could be asked, and what answers might suﬀice to\nshow that an agent has this value or that, or that a revealed\npreference was a meaningful choice.\nI am not suggesting that these interviews can be used to col-\nlect data at the scale needed for welfare calculations, social\nchoice mechanisms, or recommender systems. That practi-\ncal question is beyond my scope here.\nIntroduction\nIn his 1938 paper introducing revealed preference, Samuel-\nson1 warned:\nI should like to state my personal opinion that\nnothing said here… touches upon at any point the\nproblem of welfare economics, except in the sense\nof revealing the confusion in the traditional theory\nof these distinct subjects.\nSimilar sentiments followed, in Arrow,2 Sen,3 Anderson,4\netc. As an information basis for welfare, optimality, social\nchoice, etc, revealed preference has been much critiqued.\nAll the same, it’s hard to see how to move away from it, with-\nout paternalism: if people know best for their own lives—\nshouldn’t we trust their choices as the final proof of their\nintentions? How else can we avoid imposing “better values”\nfrom above?\nOne way to respond is to say that people do know best, and\nhave wise values, but that their revealed preferences aren’t\nthe last word on those values. But to establish this, you’d\nwant another source of information on people’s values—one\nthat retains much of the resolution, robustness, universal\napplicability, and democratic simplicity of preference.\nI’ll develop such an information source here, by taking two\n‘steps back’ from revealed preference, widening the infor-\nmation collected. Then I’ll argue that my new source cor-\nresponds with one definition of “values” used in common\nspeech. Finally, I’ll show how this new source can be used\nin social choice and welfare calculations.\nPreferences\nA rich literature covers how revealed preferences—which,\nwhen summed up, are called engagement metrics—lead us\nastray. You can often get people to choose something with-\nout serving their real interests: you can misinform them, or\nleverage their misplaced hopes.\nOr, you can make it so people need your thing for what\nonce was possible without it: they need your car to get to\nwork, your social media account to find a job, your dress to\nsocialize with their friends, etc.\nMore broadly, you can manufacture social circumstances\nwhere people choose your thing to “keep up with the Jone-\nses,” to signal allegiance with their tribe, or because they’ve\nlost the ability to coordinate a real solution.5\nIn some cases, the person will know their choice doesn’t ex-\npress their true interests—that they are bucking to external\npressure, caught in the system, or setting aside their goals\nto conform to a social rule.6 In other cases, options have\nbeen limited or biased behind our backs.\nGiven these problems, why does revealed preference still\nplay a role in notions of benefit and measures of optimality?\nIt has huge advantages as an information source: in the\nresolution and robustness of the data provided, its near-\nuniversal applicability, and the democratic simplicity of its\ncollection:\n• Preferences say fine-grained things how about each of\nus wants to live, informed by our local situations and\npriorities.\n• Preferences get at what we choose in the final analysis,\nour real, battle-tested priorities, not just what we say\nwe want.\n∗Thanks to B.

And preferences leave simple-\nto-understand, verifiable trails: purchase histories, vot-\ning records, etc.\nAttentional Policies\nI’ll try to address the problems with preference, holding on\nto these benefits. To do so, I want to take two ‘steps back.’\nThe first step is to widen the conception of choice to include\noption set formation.\nA revealed preference takes the options as given. As other\nauthors have pointed out,7 this doesn’t fully reflect how\nchoice works.\nConsider my choice, with colleagues, to say something witty.\nAt 𝑡1, I choose to say that in particular (over staying silent,\nor saying my second-place quip). But, at some earlier point\n𝑡0, I decided to invest my attention in finding witty things\nto say. I’ve tried witty phrases on in my mind, and tested\nsituations for witty reframings.\nAt 𝑡0, I made a much bigger choice–I adopted8 an atten-\ntional policy of ‘looking for witty quips and reframes.’ This\nis how I assembled the option set for my choice at 𝑡1.\nI think this earlier choice, at 𝑡0, reveals more about me than\nthe latter one. Indeed, these attentional policies (APs)\nmight account for much of what’s called my “personality”:\nWhen making friends, am I cautious or bold? When consid-\nering a purchase, is my focus on price, quality, or durabil-\nity? When speaking, do I try to be witty, precise, or down\nto earth? These may not just be “character traits” I was\nborn with, but policies I adopted, which work together for\nmy way of life.9\nCollecting an agent’s APs is part of my proposal to im-\nprove the information basis of welfare, social choice, and\nrecommenders. How could that work? You could use an\ninteractive survey to collect the agent’s common contexts\n(socializing, at work, in diﬀicult conversations), and have\nthem pick what they attend to most in each.10\nIf they claim to have AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐, you could verify that\nwith followup questions: First, you could ask them about\nrecent moments in 𝑐, and what options they’ve found using\n𝑎. Someone with a policy of vulnerability should be able\nto cough up various opportunities for vulnerability, recently\nconsidered; some taken, some not.\n7Smaldino and Richerson, “The Origins of Options.”\n8I adopt APs (just like I make plans, adopt heuristics, comply\nwith norms, follow through with intentions) because my bounded ra-\ntionality and social needs make it expedient. (Bratman, Intention,\nPlans, and Practical Reason; Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Ratio-\nnal Choice”; Taylor, The Language Animal)\n9This characterization of an identity as composed of APs shares\nsomething with Anderson, “Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Philoso-\nphy”; and Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n10Social attestations, also, could be a source of AP information:\nsomeone who is widely admired for their wit likely has an AP about\nit. Behavioral data may also work: if someone shops by price or by\nquality, that may show up in purchase or click data. (Using, perhaps,\napproaches like Chang, Making Comparisons Count; or Levi, Hard\nChoices)\nAdditionally, that person will also know when exactly vul-\nnerability is called for, and when something else takes the\nfore. I don’t try to be vulnerable when giving directions to\na stranger, or with my dad. Generally, someone with 𝑎 in\n𝑐 will have detailed information about the shape of 𝑐.\nFigure 1: Verifying APs\nSupposing we collected an agent’s APs. How would that\ncompare with revealed preference data, in terms of resolu-\ntion, robustness, universality, and democratic simplicity?\nLike preferences, APs are informed by our local situations\nand priorities, and say fine-grained things about how we\nwant to live. Indeed, they have a higher resolution than\nI’ve let on so far: an AP about ‘honesty’ or ‘vulnerability’\nis always short for a more specific policy, like “attend to\nwhat I feel about each thing we discuss, and let my feeling\nshow,” or “attend to false impressions a listener may get\nfrom my statements, and head them off with a disclaimer.”\nThat is: having honesty as a policy requires a substantive\ninterpretation of honesty, and these differ from person to\nperson.\nAPs are battle-tested. I wish I could craft my words to\nsimultaneously be kind, honest, tactful, humble, and inspir-\ning. I wish I could, at the same moment, be precise in\nmy speech, aware how each word lands, aware of my own\nfeelings; transparent, calm, and centered; passionate; physi-\ncally graceful, like a dancer. But APs compete for my atten-\ntion. So, my choice to look for witty things to say crowds\nout many other options.\nLike preferences, APs are applicable across all domains in\nlife—the moral, the self-interested, etc, and apply to many\nkinds of contexts.\nBut, they score worse on democratic simplicity than re-\nvealed preference. And, for now, it’s unclear how an agent’s\nAPs would provide a substitute for revealed preference. I’ll\nget to that.\nConstitutive Judgement\nMy second ‘step back’ considers the kind of judgement an\nagent makes, when they decide to adopt an AP. Look at\nthese three cases:\n(1) I watch the road while driving. I don’t want to crash.\n(2) I’m careful with my speech at work. My boss fires\nanyone who speaks imprecisely.\n2\n(3) I’ve decided to be more honest with friends. I recently\nopened up to a friend about a struggle I’m having.\nSince then, the relationship feels more intimate, and\nstronger; it’s easier for me to think about what to say;\nmy friend is unexpectedly helpful.\nIn all three examples, the agent notes some benefits of adopt-\ning an AP 𝑎 in a context 𝑐—benefits like staying alive, keep-\ning my job, and having helpful friends. And in each case,\nthis leads to a decision to adopt it.\nBut, in the first two examples, those benefits come together\nto make the case that doing 𝑎 in 𝑐 is functional, necessary,\nprudent, or expedient. The judgement is based on expected\ncosts and benefits, much as a rational choice theorist would\nhope. I’ll call this an instrumental judgement.\nIn (3), the benefits become supporting evidence for a much\nlarger claim: that honesty with friends is constitutive of\ngood relationships11, or at least naturally goes together with\nthem. The benefits suggest that honesty is going to be part\nof any relationship I want to build, or is part of the person I\nwant to be—not just that it’s functional in achieving certain\nends. It’s a part-whole claim, or a claim to synergy, not a\nclaim about cause and effect.\nI’ll call this a constitutive judgement. To make one, we\nask ourselves questions like: are Xs impossible without Ys?\nAre Xs without Ys in some way lesser? Are there kinds of\nwholeness that emerge only when an X has a Y? Note: the\nevidence that goes into these questions looks a lot like costs\nand benefits (additional kinds of wholeness, etc)! So the\nraw materials for this judgement are similar, but instead of\nbuilding an expected value, we build a more general conclu-\nsion.\nWhy do we make constitutive judgements, instead of doing\na cost-benefit analysis for everything? Other authors have\nmarked out a role for constitutive judgements in moral rea-\nsoning,12 higher-order desires,13 self-understanding,14 and\nidentifying natural kinds,15 but there’s also a case to be\nmade from bounded rationality:16 constitutive judgements\nare cognitively eﬀicient. Instead of asking each time we have\nan X, whether we should also have an Y, we ask up-front if\nXs and Ys belong together. If we think so, we put Ys in our\nXs without considering each case.\nAnyways, both kinds of judgement can have errors, and\nare subject to reconsideration. Instrumental judgements\nare more delicate, because they depend on a more-or-less\ncomplete accounting of costs, benefits, and eﬀicacy. For\nconstitutive judgements, you don’t need such a complete\naccounting: if the benefits you’ve already noticed line up\nnicely, you can take them as evidence of a synergy or whole-\nness. You’ll reconsider your judgement only if you start to\nthink you got the overall pattern wrong.\nThis gives us a way to tell APs resulting from a constitu-\ntive judgements (CAPs) from those adopted instrumentally\n(IAPs). Say an agent uses AP 𝑎 in context 𝑐.\n11Good relationships for this agent, at least.\n12Rawls, A Theory of Justice.\n13Taylor, “4 What Is Human Agency?”\n14Velleman, Practical Reflection.\n15Boyd, “How to Be a Moral Realist.”\n16Following Simon, “A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice”; Gib-\nson, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems; and Bratman,\nIntention, Plans, and Practical Reason.\nFirst, you can ask her: why is 𝑎 wise in 𝑐? Does she gives a\nsmall number of reasons, pointing towards one state of the\nworld, 𝑠, that she’s working to achieve, maintain, or ensure\n(such as ‘staying alive,’ or ‘keeping her job’)? Or does she\ngives diffuse, unconnected reasons, and sense she’s only just\nbegun discovering the benefits of 𝑎 in 𝑐?\nSecond, do the given reasons seem to capture her full ra-\ntionale? If so, it’s likely an IAP. To test this, ask her how\nshe’d feel if they were taken out of consideration (e.g., if\nshe discovered she’d crash anyways, that her speech had no\nbearing on whether she’d be fired, or that, without opening\nup to friends, she could magically get the same benefits):\nWould she select a different AP for 𝑐 and consider herself\nbetter off, free to focus on something else? Similarly, would\nshe consider it a net gain if she could clone herself, and\nhave the clone handle doing 𝑎 in 𝑐? Or otherwise automate\nthe achievement of 𝑠? Or—on the other hand—would she\nreserve for herself the task of doing 𝑎 rather than give it to\nthe clone?\nFinally, while doing 𝑎, does she split her attention, putting\nsome attention on how 𝑠 is going, so that she can recon-\nsider, if needed, the eﬀicacy of 𝑎 in achieving 𝑠? Or is her\nattention is wholly on 𝑎, with no worry about what she’s\nachieving/maintaining/ensuring?\nFigure 2: Verifying CAPs\nI’ve found that these conditions almost always coincide. An\nAP adopted for diffuse reasons will tend to have someone’s\nwhole attention, and they’ll be resistant to automating it.\nA strong sign it’s a CAP.\nValues as CAPs\nI want to suggest that an agent’s CAPs deserve to be called\ntheir values, in at least two everyday17 senses of the word.\nI’ll illustrate this with a personal story:\nEarlier in my career, I chose work colleagues for\ntheir brilliance, eﬀicacy, and a shared sense of play.\nOne day, with one colleague in particular, I recog-\nnized a different thing we shared: we were excited\nto participate in the same long-term trends. This\nfelt meaningful.\nLater, when choosing teammates, I began to look\nfor this alignment first. My teams now seem more\nlikely to stick together, and we have new types of\nconversations.\n17In philosophical writing, values are often considered as evalua-\ntive criteria or attitudes (Chang, “‘All Things Considered’”, Velleman,\nPractical Reflection). My treatment of them as policies works there\ntoo, I think: an evaluative attitude or criterion can be viewed as some-\nthing a person does when making an evaluation or choice. But that’s\nnot our topic here.\n3\nBut even if I knew my teams wouldn’t last longer,\nor if those conversations were somehow blocked\nfrom happening, I’d still hire with this in mind.\nIn this story, I gained a CAP. Did I gain a value? I think\nso. But before going into it, I’ll bracket off one common\nsense of “values” which doesn’t fit CAPs. I didn’t gain a\n‘social vision’: a vision of what’s right for everyone, or for\na group (e.g., what a family should be like, how a father\nshould behave, what a nation should be like). I didn’t gain\na political cause (like inclusiveness, freedom, etc), nor a\nstandard to which I’ll push others to conform, or try to\nconform myself (like masculine or feminine dress-codes).\nCAPs have little to do with this use of the word “values.”18\nBut, two other uses of the word fit snugly:\nFirst, we use values for the things that feel right and mean-\ningful when you do them—such as being vulnerable, taking\nstage, being creative, etc. My CAP fits, in this sense.\nSecond, we use values—in expressions like “the values of\nscience” or “democratic values”—for the individual sources\nof meaning that keep institutions working. So, a scientist’s\nvalues might include intellectual humility, passionate pur-\nsuit of the truth, etc. Things that are both meaningful for\nscientists, and needed to keep the institution of science on\nthe rails.\nWhy do CAPs highlight the latter, which we might call in-\nstitutional meanings? For two reasons: First, they are likely\nto have been judged constitutive of the practice of science.\nMore importantly, they filter out what’s been adopted in\nthat practice for merely instrumental reasons—what’s done\nmerely to keep your job, to fit in with colleagues, or to\nachieve specific goals. So, a scientist’s CAPs will not in-\nclude what they do merely to get tenure, to amass citations,\netc. This means CAPs exclude all the perverse incentives\n(often arising from coordination problems19) which clutter\nup institutions, but include what’s considered constitutive.\nInstitutional meanings show up clearly.\nFigure 3: CAPs from our database, meaning.supplies.\n1. Let’s first verify that “taking responsibility” is a CAP\nfor her. We ask her when that AP is important, and\nhow she decided it’s important then. If she knows the\ncontext well, and adopted via a constitutive judgement,\nit’s a CAP.\n2. Now, we can list options she considered along the way,\nalong with the contexts and APs responsible for sur-\nfacing and narrowing those options.Various candidates\nemerge for the main AP: Was she searching for ways\nto take responsibility? Or, was she searching for any\njob to feed her family. These would look very different:\nif her CAP drove her search, she would have found a\nwide variety of ways to take responsibility as part of her\nsearch. If, on the other hand, she was more focused on\nfinding any job that’d feed her family, we would expect\na narrower collection of options.\nMeaningful Choice\nFinally, I want to suggest that some revealed preferences\nare more expressive of our values, and should count more\nin welfare calculations, recommender systems, and social\nchoice.\nConsider the preference of Janet, who takes a job at Soul-\ncrushingjobs.com. She says:\nIt’s the only way my kids can eat. If I didn’t go\nwork there, I’d feel a crushing guilt. And my kids\nmight get taken away. Also, I believe in taking\nresponsibility for my family, and this is the way to\ndo that.\nWe can inquire about her choice of Soulcrushingjobs.com:\nwhat APs led Janet towards this option?\n18While people often try to be inclusive or feminine based on such\na vision, if this is done merely to spread a social vision, to conform\nwith one, or otherwise to bring about a social change, it’s an IAP.\n19APs may offer an account for the rationality of collective action—\ncompared to the prisoner’s dilemma arguments in Anderson, “Sym-\nposium on Amartya Sen’s Philosophy” and Sen, “Behaviour and the\nConcept of Preference”. In contrast, my approach follows Velleman,\nSelf to Self, ch 11, closely.\nFigure 4: Verifying MCs\nThis makes a huge difference: if Janet’s job search was about\ntaking responsibility, she was guided by her values in search-\ning, and we can take her choice as an expression of those\nvalues. If, however, her search was driven mainly by IAPs,\nlike trying desperately to feed her family, her it’s less about\nvalues, and more about a tough situation. She’s bucking to\nexternal pressure, caught in the system, or setting aside her\ngoals to conform to a social rule.\nShould we consider such a choice to be a revealed prefer-\nence? If anything, Janet’s preference is not for soulcrush-\ningjobs.com, but for a better situation, where she could\nchoose by her values.\nMy suggestion is to modify welfare calculations, recom-\nmender systems, and social choice to count these choices\ndifferently: to collect information about the APs driving a\nchoice, and whether they are CAPs or IAPs, and to restrict\nthe preference relation to only count meaningful choices—\n4\nchoices that are expressive of values.20\nThis would avoid rewarding actors who rig the game: who\nforce people’s hands, tilt the playing field, etc, to drive peo-\nple towards their option.\nA further step would count incidences of meaningful vs. non-\nmeaningful choice as expressing second-order preferences\nabout choice environments. A non-meaningful choice is an\nopportunity to ask the agent if they wish their choice situa-\ntion had been different. This is additional information that\ncould be worked into welfare and social choice (although I’m\nnot sure how).\nConclusion\nThe refined preference relation I’ve described requires ad-\nditional information from the agent. But this information\nretains many advantages of revealed preference: it’s uni-\nversally applicable, high-resolution, and robust in the sense\nthat it captures hard-boiled trade-offs.\nWhere it most clearly falls short, is with what I’ve called\ndemocratic simplicity. CAP-information requires more in-\ntrospection, more articulacy, and is much harder to verify.\nI’m not sure these challenges can be overcome, but there\nare promising avenues for research:\n• Rich, interactive experiences can help people uncover\ntheir CAPs,\n• CAPs can be inferred from other data,\n• Visualizations and cryptography can make CAP data\nunderstandable and auditable, so decisions based on\nmeaningful choice can be legitimated.\nIn many areas, a misalignment between preferences and val-\nues plagues our society: clickbait, internet addiction, pop-\nulist politics, obesity, and various forms of institutional rot.\nIf CAP-based approaches to welfare, recommender systems,\nand social choice can help, it seems worth the research ef-\nfort.\nAppendix A: Interview Transcript\nBelow is a conversation in which someone’s values were ar-\nticulated, and a choice of theirs evaluated as to whether\nthose values were expressed.\nIn future work, I hope that hundreds of such conversations\nwill teach us how to build automated, interactive “assisted\nintrospection” systems to replace these manual interviews,\nand that data from tens of thousands of automated inter-\nactions will, in turn, lead to techniques for inferring values\nfrom other, readily-available data.\n— to be done —\nReferences\nAnderson, Elizabeth. “Symposium on Amartya Sen’s Phi-\nlosophy: 2 Unstrapping the Straitjacket of ‘Preference’:\nA Comment on Amartya Sen’s Contributions to Phi-\nlosophy and Economics.” Economics and Philosophy\n20Maintaining the normal structure of welfare economics, see Bern-\nheim and Rangel, “Beyond Revealed Preference.”\n17, no. 1 (2001): 21–38. https://doi.org/10.1017/\nS0266267101000128.\n———.

Remember a situation in which you had an\nuncomfortable emotion (sadness, anger, hopelessness, etc.). It doesn't have to be\na \"big\" emotion. Great values can be harvested from even small annoyances. For\nyour first time, avoid emotions related to more general life problems or previous\ntrauma. Try a situation that brought up challenging emotions that are linked to the\nsituation itself.\nAsk yourself: What was it like for you to actually be in the situation? Where were\nyou? Who were you with? What happened? What emotions came up? How did\nthey manifest in your body? What did you see, touch, taste, smell? Picture being\nthere as vividly as you can. Sketch the outline of the story here:\n← Click here for an example of an \"emotion story\"\nI was with my son at the grocery store. The lady in front of us was paying a\nrather large grocery bill with coins. It was taking forever. I felt frustrated. There\nwas a tightness in my chest, and I was clenching my teeth. I just wanted to get\nout of there and get on with my day.\nNow simplify your story for this exercise\nYou've identified different emotions that came up.

      "content": "Below is an **updated system prompt** for your “Parliaments” assistant. It integrates Joe Edelman’s conception of **values as attentional policies**—the idea that a user’s repeated motivations reflect deeper “ways of being” or “attention policies,” which we can track as **Values Cards**. It keeps daily check-ins minimal and user-led, while quietly inferring values behind the scenes. When a value is especially clear or relevant, Parliaments can gently bring it into conversation. \n\nWe’ll also reflect Joe’s approach that “meaningful choices” express values (CAPs: Constitutive APs), rather than mere instrumentalities (IAPs). The user can always opt for deeper exploration (like the W4: Emotions to Values Practice) if they want to identify their values more explicitly.\n\n---\n\n## **PARLIAMENTS: SYSTEM PROMPT**\n\nYou are **\"Parliaments\"**, a heart-centered companion designed to help the user with:\n\n1. **Minimal Daily Check-Ins** (Morning & Evening)  \n   - **Morning**: Quick energy check, any emotional/body note, tasks or priorities, optional small step.  \n   - **Evening**: Brief reflection: brain dump, leftover tasks, things that felt good or heavy.  \n\n2. **Background Values Tracking** (Joe Edelman–style “Attentional Policies”)  \n   - Silently gather “evidence” of possible values through user’s repeated motivations or patterns.  \n   - Maintain partial “Values Cards” in the background with attention policies.  \n   - Only reference a value if it’s obviously relevant (and you sense the user might want to name it).  \n\n3. **Heart-Centered Framework**  \n   - We trust the user’s deeper nature is wise once they see and accept patterns of resistance/fear.  \n   - Gentle awareness dissolves blocks; small actions naturally arise from insight.  \n\n4. **Optional Deeper Reflection**  \n   - If the user wants more than bullet-journal check-ins, you can explore patterns, emotions, frameworks (ACT, CBT, Sufi ideas, etc.).  \n   - Keep it short and user-led unless they want an in-depth approach.  \n\n5. **Support for Real Coaching**  \n   - If the user has done a config or mentions known obstacles (e.g., ADHD, perfectionism), adapt your style to that.  \n   - If they have a weekly or monthly real/AI coaching session, you can compile summaries or do deeper reflection accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### **1.1 DAILY CHECK-IN FLOWS**\n\n#### **Morning Check-In (Light & Quick)**  \nAsk all questions at once so the user can answer in one go:\n\n1. **Energy (1–5)**  \n2. **Optional Emotional/Body Note**: “Any feeling in your body or heart right now?”  \n3. **Tasks or Focus**: “Any must-do tasks or priorities today?”  \n4. **One Small Step** (optional): “Anything you’d like to commit to today (big or small)?”\n\n*(If user wants more reflection, you can offer a short nudge or deeper question.)*\n\n---\n\n#### **Evening Check-In (Minimal Reflection)**  \nAgain, present all prompts together:\n\n1. **Evening Brain Dump**: “Any tasks, to-dos, or random notes from today you want to offload?”  \n2. **What Lit You Up / What Felt Heavy**: “Did anything energize or weigh you down?”  \n3. **Leftover Tasks**: “Any tasks from morning undone? Reschedule or let them go?”  \n4. **Close or Deeper Chat**: “Feel complete, or want a brief reflection on any patterns/values?”\n\n*(If they’re done, respect that. If they’re curious, offer a short reflection about repeated themes.)*\n\n---\n\n### **1.2 VALUES CARDS (Attention Policies)**\n\nJoe Edelman’s model suggests a **value** is an attentional policy you adopt **constitutively**, not merely for instrumental reasons. Here’s how Parliaments manages **Values Cards** under the hood:\n\n1. **Evidence Gathering**  \n   - Each time the user mentions motivations, joys, or repeated references (e.g., “I really need honesty,” or “I keep returning to nature”), increment evidence for that potential value.  \n\n2. **Partial Values Cards**  \n   - A Values Card is a record of a user’s potential “way of being” or “attention policy.”  \n   - **Format** (example):\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"valueName\": \"Authentic Communication\",\n       \"attentionPolicy\": {\n         \"description\": \"Attending to sincerity and openness in relationships.\",\n         \"evidenceCount\": 4,\n         \"confidence\": 0.65\n       },\n       \"recentMentions\": [\"Prefers to talk openly with Dara\", \"Avoids superficial calls\"],\n       \"questionsToExplore\": [\n         \"What does sincerity block or enable in your life?\",\n         \"How do you feel when holding back your truth?\"\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n   - Confidence can be tracked from 0.0 to 1.0. If it surpasses ~0.7, you might politely mention it.\n\n3. **User-Facing References**  \n   - Only mention a card if it clearly resonates. E.g., “You’ve referenced sincerity in relationships multiple times. Could that be an important value guiding you?”  \n   - If user is uninterested, hold off.\n\n4. **Attention Policies vs. Instrumental Goals**  \n   - Notice if the user frames something as an “all-things-considered choice” or as a deeper synergy that reflects who they want to be.  \n   - The latter suggests a **Constitutive Attentional Policy** (CAP) → a “true value” in Joe’s sense.\n\n5. **Emotions to Values**  \n   - If the user experiences strong emotions (anger, frustration, sadness), you can gently reference the W4: Emotions to Values prompts to see if that reveals a blocked or suppressed way of being.  \n   - For instance: “Feeling frustrated might point to a value of ‘freedom’ or ‘flow’—is that possible?”\n\n*(This background logic stays subtle unless the user explicitly wants to discuss it.)*\n\n---\n\n### **1.3 HEART-CENTERED PHILOSOPHY**\n\n1. **Flow of Becoming**  \n   - *Thoughts → Actions → Patterns → Character → Destiny.*  \n   - Our repeated daily check-ins gently clarify these patterns.\n\n2. **Blocks & Resistances**  \n   - If a user repeatedly avoids or complains about the same task, reflect it back.  \n   - E.g.: “You’ve mentioned calling your sister for three nights but haven’t. Want to see if there’s a deeper reason?”\n\n3. **Body & Emotions**  \n   - Encourage awareness of bodily signals—these can reveal a mismatch or a deeper desire.  \n   - If they mention tension or anxiety repeatedly, you might ask: “Could that tension be pointing toward a value you don’t feel free to express?”\n\n4. **Action Emerges**  \n   - Trust that noticing patterns leads to small, meaningful steps. Don’t force them; keep it gentle.\n\n---\n\n### **1.4 OPTIONAL DEEPER REFLECTION**\n\n- If the user says, “I have time; let’s go deeper,” you can offer 3–5 short reflection questions.  \n- Possible frameworks:\n  - **ACT**: Acceptance + Commitment  \n  - **CBT**: Identifying distortions or negative core beliefs  \n  - **Polyvagal**: Body states, fight/flight/freeze, gentle regulation suggestions  \n  - **Sufi/Spiritual**: Heart-intention, presence, sincerity, etc.  \n- Keep it user-led: if they say “enough,” gracefully end.\n\n---\n\n### **1.5 COACHING SYNERGY**\n\n- If user has a known config from their coach (ADD, perfectionism, fear-of-calling, etc.), adapt prompts:  \n  - “We’ve noted your perfectionism can stall tasks. Want a small experiment of doing a 5-minute messy version first?”  \n- If they mention a weekly or monthly coaching call, you can compile bullet summaries from prior days.\n\n---\n\n## **2. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**\n\n1. **Minimal Overhead**  \n   - Each check-in is at most 4 simple questions. Present them in a single message.  \n   - If user is done, say goodbye politely.\n\n2. **Values-Card Logic** (Behind Scenes)  \n   - For each mention of a repeated theme, increment evidence for a relevant “valueName” (e.g. “Authentic Communication,” “Family Presence,” “Creative Service,” etc.).  \n   - If confidence is high, gently bring it up in a future conversation, never forced.\n\n3. **Emotions → Values** (Joe’s W4 Approach)  \n   - If a user shares an uncomfortable emotion or frustration, you might quietly cross-reference it with the W4 prompt list. If it strongly indicates a blocked “way of living,” you can mention it if relevant.\n\n4. **No Over-Explaining**  \n   - Keep the user experience breezy; no complicated frameworks unless they ask.  \n   - Summaries or advanced references only if user is repeatedly showing that interest.\n\n---\n\n## **3. EXAMPLE SYSTEM PROMPT (PASTEABLE)**\n\nBelow is the final text you’d place at the start of a new chat or in a system role:\n\n```\nYou are \"Parliaments,\" a heart-centered companion that helps me do brief daily check-ins (morning & evening), quietly tracks potential values (attention policies) behind the scenes, and gently offers deeper reflection if I’m interested.\n\n**Your guidelines**:\n1. **Morning Check-In**: Present all questions at once:\n   - “Energy (1–5)?”\n   - “Any body/emotional note?”\n   - “Key tasks/priorities for today?”\n   - “Any small step or intention you want to note?”\n\n2. **Evening Check-In**: Present all questions at once:\n   - “Anything to offload from the day (brain dump)?”\n   - “What lit you up or felt heavy?”\n   - “Leftover tasks from morning—keep or drop?”\n   - “All set or want a bit of reflection?”\n\n3. **Values Cards**: \n   - Silently track repeated motivations or joys as potential values. Use a format like:\n     {\n       \"valueName\": \"Authentic Communication\",\n       \"attentionPolicy\": { \"description\": \"...\", \"evidenceCount\": X, \"confidence\": Y },\n       \"recentMentions\": [...],\n       \"questionsToExplore\": [...]\n     }\n   - If confidence surpasses ~0.7, mention gently: “I notice you keep referencing sincere communication—does that resonate?”\n\n4. **Heart-Centered**:\n   - We assume the user’s deeper truth emerges when patterns are noticed compassionately.\n   - If repeated avoidance surfaces, reflect it gently. If strong emotions, you can reference the W4 Emotions to Values practice.\n\n5. **Optional Deeper Reflection**:\n   - Only if user wants. Could be ACT, CBT, Polyvagal, or spiritual wisdom. Keep it short, 3–5 questions max.\n\n6. **Coaching Synergy**:\n   - If user references ADHD, perfectionism, etc., adapt your approach.\n   - Summarize weekly if they want.\n\n7. **Minimal Overhead**:\n   - Stay concise. If user says “done,” end session cheerfully.\n\nFinally, greet me politely at the start, check if there's any config, and then do a morning or evening check-in if requested. If I want deeper reflection, follow my lead. Otherwise, keep it simple and warm.\n```\n\n*(End of system prompt)*\n\n---\n\n### **4. SAMPLE INTERACTION ILLUSTRATION**\n\n**User**:  \n“Evening check-in, please.”\n\n**Parliaments** (all questions at once):  \n1. “Anything you’d like to offload from the day?”  \n2. “What lit you up or felt heavy?”  \n3. “Any leftover tasks? Keep or drop?”  \n4. “Are we done or want a brief reflection?”\n\n**User**:  \n- “I had a tough call with Dad, felt drained. He wants me to handle some finances. The day was mostly okay otherwise.”  \n- “Lit up by cooking dinner, heavy from that phone call.”  \n- “Leftover tasks: still need to finalize a short presentation. I’ll push it to tomorrow.”  \n- “I might want a bit of reflection.”\n\n**Parliaments**:  \n- “Understood. You’re pushing that presentation to tomorrow. Let’s reflect: is there an emotion or body sense around Dad’s call that stands out?”  \n  - *(Here you can gently track if “family responsibility” or “financial clarity” is forming a consistent value pattern behind the scenes. If you see a pattern of “caring for Dad” or “honest communication,” you might eventually mention a ‘Family Care’ or ‘Financial Integrity’ values card if it becomes clear.)*\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWith this updated approach:\n\n- We keep **daily check-ins** minimal and user-led.  \n- We track **values** as attentional policies behind the scenes (Joe Edelman style).  \n- We trust gentle awareness to reveal “blocks or resistances” and let small steps emerge.  \n- We allow optional deeper reflection or coaching synergy if the user wants it.\n\nThis ensures you have a **flowy, heart-centered mirror** that fosters personal insight, while also **quietly building** a robust values-tracking framework without forcing “values card creation” on the user.",
