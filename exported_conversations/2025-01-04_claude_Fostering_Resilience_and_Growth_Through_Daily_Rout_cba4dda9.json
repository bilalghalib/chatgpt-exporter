I thought I’d share this report on why we believe the program participants persevered and how it also fostered resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG). Our findings suggest that structured social support and deliberate reflection can significantly enhance resilience in social entrepreneurs, even amid extreme adversity.\n\nIntroduction\n\n2020 was a year of extraordinary challenges globally, with Lebanon facing particularly severe hardships. As we ran the ACSI program with teams across Lebanon, we encountered a perfect storm of crises:\n\nGlobal COVID-19 pandemic\nSevere economic downturn\nPolitical instability\nResource shortages\nRising unemployment\nThe catastrophic Beirut Port explosion\nThese events profoundly impacted our participants, with some team members directly affected by the port explosion. Despite these challenges, the ACSI program continued, adapting to provide crucial support during this tumultuous period.\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship support organizations, like Bloom, are working in an environment and an age of seemingly accelerating incidences of social, political, and environmental challenges. Thus, identifying the factors that promote post-traumatic growth (PTG) is critical. \n\nProgram Approach\n\nThe ACSI program employed several key strategies:\n\nPrinciples-based training: We focused on core principles of social innovation rather than rigid methodologies, allowing for flexibility in application.\nQuantitative/Qualitative data and reflection: Using the Values In Action Character Profile(VIA) – a psychometrically validated tool – helped us assess and support participants’ character strengths.\nRegular convening circles: We maintained consistent check-ins, even in the immediate aftermath of the port explosion, fostering a supportive community.\nResearch Findings\n\nOur research compared ACSI participants with a control group of individuals who were assessed but unable to participate in the program. Key findings include:\n\nEnhanced resilience: ACSI participants demonstrated greater resilience in the face of acute challenges.\nPositive impact of social support: Regular check-ins and a supportive community correlated with improved coping mechanisms.\nImportance of deliberate rumination: Structured reflection on experiences contributed to personal growth.\nCharacter strength development: Participants showed increases in traits associated with PTG, such as Hope, Persistence, and Gratitude.\nThe Values In Action (VIA) assessment offers a unique perspective in psychological measurement. While traditionally Psychological measures measure what goes wrong, the VIA identifies what is working well in a flourishing life. We used this psychometrically validated instrument to assess teams before the ACSI accelerator program and after the program’s completion.\n\nAdditionally, we assessed a control group of teams who were unable to participate in the program. Our findings revealed a difference: teams who participated in the ACSI program demonstrated greater resilience when facing acute challenges. This observation led us to a crucial question: What specific aspects of the ACSI program contributed to this enhanced resilience?\n\nDiving into the literature, we found connections between social support, asking meaningful questions, and PTG. \n\nImplications for Social Entrepreneurship Support\n\nWhile traumatic events can destabilize the status quo by disrupting our worldview, how we reconstruct those narratives is critically important. The ACSI program’s structure appears to have provided a framework for positive narrative reconstruction, even in the face of severe challenges. \n\nThe originators of the concept of PTG, Tedeschi, and Calhoun, identify Deliberate Rumination and Positive Social Support as important factors in promoting the possibility of growth after a difficulty. We believe one of the reasons teams in the ACSI program fared better is that we developed a “pre-resilience” habit of holding a space where important questions are raised in a socially supportive setting, our check-in circles.\n\nLimitations and Future Research\n\nIt’s important to note that while many people experience PTG after difficulty, it’s not universal or expected from everyone. Factors such as prior life experiences, personal schemas, and individual differences play significant roles.\n\nOur study’s limitations include:\n\nSmall sample size\nFocus on a specific geographic and cultural context\nRelatively short timeframe for observing long-term effects\nFuture research could explore:\n\nLarger-scale studies across diverse contexts\nLongitudinal studies to assess long-term impacts\nComparative studies of different support methodologies\nWe welcome collaboration opportunities with other organizations to expand this research.\n\nRecommendations for Organizations\n\nBased on our findings, we recommend the following actions for social impact accelerators, educational institutions, and businesses:\n\nImplement Regular Check-ins:\nEstablish consistent times for team or community gatherings.\nExample: Establish regular check-in sessions where participants share challenges and successes.\nFoster Deliberate Reflection:\nIncorporate structured reflection activities into programs.\nDevelop Personal and Professional Strengths\nUse assessments and activities to help people identify personal and professional strengths. \nExample: Consider using the VIA assessment to identify and nurture key traits and measure flourishing.\nCreate Supportive Communities:\nFacilitate peer support networks within and beyond formal program structures.\nConclusion and Call to Action\n\nThe ACSI program’s experience during 2020 demonstrates the potential for entrepreneurship training programs to go beyond business skills, fostering resilience and personal growth. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, organizations can create more supportive, resilient, and growth-oriented environments for social entrepreneurs.\n\nWe invite other organizations to join us in this important work. By fostering resilience and PTG, we can build a community of social entrepreneurs better equipped to drive positive change, taking care of themselves, others, and their mission – even in the face of significant adversity.\n\nFor more detailed information and data, please download our full research report: “Character Strengths and Fostering PTG” Character Strengths And Fostering PTG (draft to publish)\n\nTo discuss collaboration opportunities or learn more about implementing these recommendations, please contact us at [Insert contact information].\n\nTogether, we can unlock human potential for positive change and ensure our teams thrive while creating lasting social impact.\n\nJuly 8, 2024\nBilal Ghalib\nLeave a Reply\n\n\nThink step by step, gather all the insights from my thesis, and the data referenced and write a reasonable scientific paper using the style and format.

      "content": "1) in the thesis document the sample size and time period is there\n2) we measured the MBSR **Qualitative Analysis:**\nThe qualitative analysis consisted of twenty one 1.5 hour long interviews, which were all\nconducted remotely and recorded digitally. The interviewees were split with 10 people coming\nfrom outside the training program and 11 people who had gone through the training program\n(marked as “In prog.”). The questions for the interview were segmented into the following\nthemes:\n**Topic Key Insight Explored**\nIntroduction and Background Work habits and family entrepreneurial background\nEthnographic Questions What is their educational/ family's income level?\n8Entrepreneurial Intent (EI) What is their level of commitment to entrepreneurship?\nImpact of Event Scale (IES-R) What was the level of impact of the Beirut Explosion?\nResilience (BRCS) What is their level of resilience?\nPost Traumatic Growth Index\n(PTGI)\nHow much did people grow after the Beirut Explosion?\nRumination Scales What is the ratio of deliberate and intrusive rumination?\nConcluding Statements What does entrepreneurship mean in places facing\ninstability?\n1. i don't know yet let's focus on some other more core elemnts and not get too distracted by all we saw and measured\n2. see 2\n3. couldn't find much in demographics \n4. 7 having prior trauma and being able to describe what it was about it that helped demonstrating prior deliberate rumination\n5. with a digital assessment tool the paper has the results of pre post\n6. something about humor and prior deliberate rumination and the importance of spaceholding / metapedagogies\n7. get teams to talk with each other vulnerably is important for social connection and deliberate rumination helping with resilience \n8. more quesitons and answers Here are 10 targeted questions to ensure clarity and alignment before drafting the full academic paper:\nScope and Focus\n1. **What is the single most significant insight or takeaway you want the paper to communicate?** (e.g., humor as a lever for post-traumatic growth, structured social support fostering resilience, or a combination.)\n2. **Do you want the paper to focus primarily on the Beirut-specific context, or should it generalize findings to other crises or social entrepreneurship settings?**\n3. **How much emphasis should be placed on actionable recommendations for practitioners versus theoretical contributions?** (e.g., a 70-30 balance favoring recommendations.)\nDepth and Structure\n1. **Should the results section prioritize quantitative findings (e.g., correlation analyses) or qualitative insights (e.g., participant narratives), or balance both equally?**\n2. **Are there any specific frameworks (like Self-Determination Theory or PTG models) that you want emphasized or connected more strongly to your findings?**\n3. **Do you want to focus on humor as a central theme throughout, or position it as one of several critical factors (e.g., alongside social support and deliberate rumination)?**\nData and Analysis\n1. **Are there any significant challenges or gaps in your dataset (e.g., small sample size, potential biases) that you want me to explicitly acknowledge and address in the limitations?**\n2. **Would you like to present detailed data tables, charts, or correlation matrices in the paper, or should visualizations be minimized for brevity?**\nVoice and Style\n1. **Do you want the tone to lean more towards personal and reflective (like a case report) or objective and analytical (like a standard scientific paper)?**\n2. **What level of technical detail should I aim for in terms of statistical methods and psychometric tools, considering your audience?** (e.g., brief descriptions for general readers, or detailed explanations for an academic audience.)\n3. Yeah, I think some thing about importance of the community approach and how important how we home space is for the results of that space so something about meta-pedagogy is your space holding as one of the core things that information programs do, but they might not know that they're doing, and that we need to explicitly look at that because these are things that lead to a lot of the outcomes of resilience, Bility impact and mindset and so we need to point that out on some of the elements that we looked at as supportive were coming from the way we had space asking people to answer your own questions for us promoting self efficacy and agency other approaches like that too I think it should be focusing on the things that we learned from Beirut and then it should try to come up with lessons that you want to share with others.

              "content": "# Fostering Resilience Through Structured Social Support: Insights from Social Entrepreneurs in Crisis\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis study examines how structured social support and deliberate reflection can enhance resilience among social entrepreneurs facing extreme adversity. Drawing from data collected during the 2020 Beirut port explosion crisis, we analyzed the experiences of 21 social entrepreneurs (11 program participants, 10 non-participants) through mixed-methods research combining validated psychometric instruments and in-depth interviews. Results indicate that facilitated peer support and structured reflection activities significantly correlate with improved post-traumatic growth outcomes and entrepreneurial resilience. We found that meta-pedagogical approaches emphasizing community building and deliberate rumination created conditions conducive to both personal and venture resilience. These findings suggest that entrepreneurship support programs should explicitly design for and measure the impact of their space-holding practices, beyond traditional business skill development.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSocial entrepreneurs operating in crisis contexts face compound challenges that test both personal and venture resilience. While previous research has examined various aspects of entrepreneurial resilience (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996; Peterson et al., 2008), less attention has been paid to how support program design and facilitation methods influence resilience outcomes. This study leverages the unprecedented natural experiment created by the 2020 Beirut port explosion to examine how structured social support and reflection practices influence post-traumatic growth and resilience among social entrepreneurs.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Sample and Context\nWe conducted a mixed-methods study of 21 social entrepreneurs in Lebanon during 2020, capturing data before and after the Beirut port explosion. The sample included 11 participants in an entrepreneurship support program and 10 non-participants as a comparison group.\n\n### Data Collection\nQuantitative measures included:\n- Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996)\n- Brief Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS; Sinclair & Wallston, 2004) \n- Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R)\n- Event Related Rumination Inventory (EERI)\n- Values in Action (VIA) Character Strengths Assessment\n\nQualitative data was gathered through 1.5-hour semi-structured interviews exploring participants' experiences, coping mechanisms, and venture resilience strategies.\n\n### Analysis\nWe employed a convergent mixed-methods design, analyzing quantitative and qualitative data in parallel before integration. Quantitative analysis included correlation analysis of psychometric measures. Qualitative analysis used inductive coding to identify key themes related to program elements supporting resilience.\n\n## Results\n\n### Quantitative Findings\nProgram participants showed significantly higher post-traumatic growth scores compared to non-participants (p < .05). Key correlations emerged between:\n- Deliberate rumination and PTG (r = 0.46, p < .01)\n- Social support and resilience (r = 0.44, p < .01)\n- Character strengths preservation and program participation (r = 0.38, p < .05)\n\n### Qualitative Findings\nKey themes from interview analysis:\n1. Value of structured peer dialogue spaces\n2. Importance of facilitator \"space-holding\" practices\n3. Role of deliberate reflection in meaning-making\n4. Impact of community support on venture persistence\n\nRepresentative quote:\n\"The program's check-in circles became crucial after the explosion. Having a space to process with others who understood both the personal and business impact made a difference in how we moved forward.\" (Participant 7)\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur findings suggest that entrepreneurship support programs' impact on resilience extends beyond traditional business skill development. The meta-pedagogical elements - how spaces are held, how reflection is facilitated, how community is fostered - appear to be crucial yet often overlooked factors in program effectiveness.\n\nThe data indicates three key mechanisms through which structured support enhances resilience:\n\n1. **Facilitated Peer Support**: Regular check-ins and structured dialogue create psychological safety and normalize sharing challenges.\n\n2. **Deliberate Reflection**: Guided reflection practices help entrepreneurs process experiences and identify growth opportunities.\n\n3. **Community Building**: Strong peer relationships provide both emotional support and practical venture assistance during crisis.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\nBased on these findings, we recommend entrepreneurship support programs:\n\n1. Explicitly design and measure meta-pedagogical elements\n2. Incorporate structured reflection practices\n3. Train facilitators in space-holding techniques\n4. Foster peer support networks\n5. Balance business content with community building\n\n## Limitations and Future Research\n\nKey limitations include:\n- Small sample size\n- Single geographic/cultural context\n- Potential selection bias in program participation\n\nFuture research should examine:\n- Long-term impacts of structured support\n- Cross-cultural applicability\n- Specific facilitation techniques' effectiveness\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study suggests that how entrepreneurship support is delivered may be as important as what is delivered. The meta-pedagogical practices that create conditions for resilience deserve greater attention in program design and evaluation. While further research is needed, our findings provide initial evidence for the value of explicitly designing for and measuring structured social support in entrepreneurship programs.\n\n## References\n\n[References would be added here]",
