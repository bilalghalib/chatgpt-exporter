      "content": " To create a progress bar that displays all ten levels with a single short description of being good at each stage, you can use HTML and CSS. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\nHTML:\n```html\n<div class=\"progress-bar\">\n  <div class=\"level\" data-level=\"1\">\n    <span class=\"description\">Ideation: Generating and exploring ideas</span>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"level\" data-level=\"2\">\n    <span class=\"description\">Idea-Stage: Developing and refining concepts</span>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"level\" data-level=\"3\">\n    <span class=\"description\">Prototype: Creating and testing early versions</span>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"level\" data-level=\"4\">\n    <span class=\"description\">Early-Stage: Launching and gaining traction</span>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"level\" data-level=\"5\">\n    <span class=\"description\">Growth-Stage: Scaling and expanding the business</span>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nCSS:\n```css\n.progress-bar {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  align-items: center;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 50px;\n  background-color: #f0f0f0;\n  border-radius: 25px;\n  padding: 0 20px;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n.level {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 20px;\n  height: 20px;\n  background-color: #ccc;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n.level.active {\n  background-color: #4CAF50;\n}\n\n.level:hover .description {\n  visibility: visible;\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n\n.description {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: -40px;\n  left: 50%;\n  transform: translateX(-50%);\n  background-color: #333;\n  color: #fff;\n  padding: 5px 10px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  font-size: 12px;\n  white-space: nowrap;\n  visibility: hidden;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: visibility 0s, opacity 0.3s ease;\n}\n```\n\nIn the HTML code, we define a `<div>` element with the class `progress-bar`, which represents the entire progress bar. Inside it, we have five `<div>` elements with the class `level`, each representing a different level of the progress bar. Each level has a `data-level` attribute that specifies the level number and a `<span>` element with the class `description` that contains a short description of being good at that stage.\n\nIn the CSS code, we style the progress bar and levels. The `.progress-bar` class sets the overall layout and appearance of the progress bar. The `.level` class styles each individual level as a circular marker. The `.active` class is used to highlight the current active level. The `.description` class styles the short description that appears when hovering over a level.\n\nTo make a level active, you can add the `active` class to the corresponding `<div>` element. For example, to mark the third level as active, you would change the HTML to:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"level active\" data-level=\"3\">\n  <span class=\"description\">Prototype: Creating and testing early versions</span>\n</div>\n```\n\nYou can adjust the styles, colors, and descriptions to match your specific requirements.",

The user can select their level by clicking on the corresponding radio button.\n\nWhen a radio button is selected, the JavaScript code listens for the `change` event and retrieves the selected level value. It then determines the appropriate result text based on the selected level:\n- Levels 1-3: \"Just starting to understand customers and stakeholders\"\n- Levels 4-6: \"Making progress in understanding customers and stakeholders\"\n- Levels 7-8: \"Doing well in understanding customers and stakeholders\"\n- Levels 9-10: \"Excellent understanding of customers and stakeholders\"\n\nThe result text is then displayed in the `<div>` element with the ID `result`.\n\nThe CSS code styles the table and result text to make it visually appealing.\n\nYou can customize the level ranges, result texts, and styles to match your specific requirements.",
