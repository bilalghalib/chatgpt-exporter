      "content": "It seems like there was a partial outage on EAS Build for iOS builds, but the current error message is related to the configuration of your EAS project. \n\nThe message indicates that EAS Build requires a git repository for your project and it looks like you haven't initialized one yet. The prompt is asking if you would like to run 'git init' in your project directory to initialize the repository.\n\nOnce you have initialized the git repository, the prompt will create an initial commit and generate an eas.json file for your project. After that, it will ask if you would like to create an EAS project automatically. If you choose yes, it will create an EAS project for your app on Expo and link it to your local project.\n\nHowever, it looks like there was an error when linking your local project to the EAS project, and it seems like the error is related to a missing config file. Without more information, it's difficult to say what the specific issue is. \n\nI recommend checking the error message again and seeing if there are any more details about what went wrong. You may also want to check the documentation or reach out to the EAS Build support team for assistance.",

The error message indicates that the command failed with exit code 128 and there was an issue with running the \"git ls-remote\" command to fetch a package.\n\nThe error message specifically mentions that the host key verification failed when trying to fetch a package from a remote Git repository located at ssh://git@github.com/samsaffron/react-native-safari-view.git. This suggests that there may be an issue with the SSH connection to the Git repository.\n\nOne possible cause of this error could be that the SSH key used to authenticate the connection to the Git repository is invalid or not authorized to access the repository. You may want to check if the SSH key is set up correctly and authorized to access the repository. \n\nAnother possibility is that there may be an issue with the Git repository itself or with the network connection. You may want to check if the Git repository is available and accessible from the machine running the \"yarn install\" command. \n\nFinally, the warning message regarding package-lock.json suggests that there may be inconsistencies in the lock files generated by different package managers. You may want to try removing the \"package-lock.json\" file as suggested in the warning message and then re-run \"yarn install\" to see if that resolves the issue.",
