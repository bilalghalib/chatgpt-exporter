I'm available at your convenience if you'd like to discuss anything further.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any way I can provide more information or be helpful as you evaluate next steps. I look forward to hearing from you about whether you'd like to move forward with scheduling the pilot program.\n\nRegards,\n[Your name]\n\nSome notes:\n\n• The subject line clearly states this is a follow up to remind them of your last conversation.\n\n• The opening sentence is friendly and warm but gets straight to the point of why you're emailing.\n\n• You express continued interest and excitement but with a collaborative and helpful tone. \n\n• You offer your availability and assistance without being pushy. \n\n• You close by restating your interest in moving forward but leave the ball in their court.\n\n• The overall tone is positive, helpful and balanced without being too aggressive or impatient.
