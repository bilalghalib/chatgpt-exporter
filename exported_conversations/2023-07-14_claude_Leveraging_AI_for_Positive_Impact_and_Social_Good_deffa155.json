Below is a breakdown of interactive activities and exercises for each session:\n\nSession 1: Friday (2 hours) Objective: Introduce participants to the concept of AI and its potential for positive impact on NGO work.\n\n1.  Icebreaker: Begin the session with an icebreaker activity to foster engagement and connection among participants. For example, ask each participant to briefly introduce themselves and share one challenge they face in their NGO work.\n    \n2.  Presentation: Deliver a presentation on the basics of AI, including definitions, types of AI, and examples of AI applications in the NGO sector. Use visual aids and include opportunities for participants to ask questions and engage in discussions.\n    \n3.  Case Study Analysis: Divide participants into small breakout rooms and provide them with a case study related to an NGO in the Middle East that successfully implemented AI for positive impact. In their groups, they should analyze the case study, discuss the challenges faced, and identify the potential benefits and lessons learned.\n    \n4.  Group Discussion: Bring participants back to the main session and facilitate a group discussion based on the case study analysis. Encourage participants to share their insights, ask questions, and exchange ideas on how AI can be applied to their own organizations.\n    \n5.  Interactive Activity: Use virtual liberating structures principles by conducting a \"1-2-4-All\" activity. Pose a question related to AI and ask participants to reflect individually for one minute. Then, pair them up to discuss their thoughts for two minutes. Afterward, group pairs together in fours to share their collective ideas for four minutes. Finally, ask each group to share the key takeaways from their discussions with the whole workshop.\n    \n\nSession 2: Saturday (2 hours) Objective: Explore the use of large language AI models and their potential impact on NGO work.\n\n1.  Recap and Reflection: Begin the session by briefly summarizing the key points from the previous session and inviting participants to share any insights or questions that arose after further reflection.\n    \n2.

Here are some suggested icebreaker activities for each session:\n\nSession 1 (Friday):\n\n1.  Two Truths and a Lie: Each participant shares two true statements and one false statement about themselves. The others then guess which statement is the lie.\n    \n2.  This or That: Present a series of choices (e.g., coffee or tea, mountains or beach) and ask participants to quickly choose their preference. They can briefly explain why they made their choice.\n    \n3.  Virtual Scavenger Hunt: Provide a list of items or concepts related to AI or NGOs. Participants search their surroundings and show the item or concept on their webcam. They can briefly explain the connection.\n    \n\nSession 2 (Saturday):\n\n1.  Share Your Superpower: Each participant shares a unique skill or talent they possess and explain how it can be applied to AI or NGOs.\n    \n2.  Emoji Introductions: Ask participants to introduce themselves using only emojis. They can choose emojis that represent their name, profession, or interests.\n    \n3.  Picture Perfect: Share a thought-provoking image related to AI or NGO work. Participants take turns describing what they see, how it relates to the workshop, or how it inspires them.\n    \n\nSession 3 (Sunday):\n\n1.  Memory Chain: Start with one participant sharing a word related to AI or NGOs. The next participant adds another word that starts with the last letter of the previous word. Continue the chain until everyone has contributed.\n    \n2.  Quiz Time: Prepare a short quiz with multiple-choice questions about AI and its impact on NGOs. Participants can use the chat function to submit their answers, and discuss the correct answers together afterwards.\n    \n3.  Personal Impact Stories: Each participant shares a personal anecdote or experience where AI has made a positive impact on their work or organization. This encourages reflection and inspires others.\n    \n\nBy incorporating these icebreaker activities, participants will have the opportunity to connect, engage, and contribute their own ideas and experiences. These activities promote a collaborative and interactive workshop atmosphere, setting the stage for\n\n**Task Added:**Create a list of interactive activities for each day of the workshop that promote engagement and learning about large language AI models and their impact on NGO work.\n\n✨ Starting task: Create a list of discussion questions for the group activity in Session 2 of the workshop.\n\n**Executing: Summarizing Design a workshop on using ai for positive impact for ngos in the middle east.

Below is a breakdown of interactive activities and exercises for each session:\n\nSession 1: Friday (2 hours) Objective: Introduce participants to the concept of AI and its potential for positive impact on NGO work.\n\n1.  Icebreaker: Begin the session with an icebreaker activity to foster engagement and connection among participants. For example, ask each participant to briefly introduce themselves and share one challenge they face in their NGO work.\n    \n2.  Presentation: Deliver a presentation on the basics of AI, including definitions, types of AI, and examples of AI applications in the NGO sector. Use visual aids and include opportunities for participants to ask questions and engage in discussions.\n    \n3.  Case Study Analysis: Divide participants into small breakout rooms and provide them with a case study related to an NGO in the Middle East that successfully implemented AI for positive impact. In their groups, they should analyze the case study, discuss the challenges faced, and identify the potential benefits and lessons learned.\n    \n4.  Group Discussion: Bring participants back to the main session and facilitate a group discussion based on the case study analysis. Encourage participants to share their insights, ask questions, and exchange ideas on how AI can be applied to their own organizations.\n    \n5.  Interactive Activity: Use virtual liberating structures principles by conducting a \"1-2-4-All\" activity. Pose a question related to AI and ask participants to reflect individually for one minute. Then, pair them up to discuss their thoughts for two minutes. Afterward, group pairs together in fours to share their collective ideas for four minutes. Finally, ask each group to share the key takeaways from their discussions with the whole workshop.\n    \n\nSession 2: Saturday (2 hours) Objective: Explore the use of large language AI models and their potential impact on NGO work.\n\n1.  Recap and Reflection: Begin the session by briefly summarizing the key points from the previous session and inviting participants to share any insights or questions that arose after further reflection.\n    \n2.

Here are some suggested icebreaker activities for each session:\n\nSession 1 (Friday):\n\n1.  Two Truths and a Lie: Each participant shares two true statements and one false statement about themselves. The others then guess which statement is the lie.\n    \n2.  This or That: Present a series of choices (e.g., coffee or tea, mountains or beach) and ask participants to quickly choose their preference. They can briefly explain why they made their choice.\n    \n3.  Virtual Scavenger Hunt: Provide a list of items or concepts related to AI or NGOs. Participants search their surroundings and show the item or concept on their webcam. They can briefly explain the connection.\n    \n\nSession 2 (Saturday):\n\n1.  Share Your Superpower: Each participant shares a unique skill or talent they possess and explain how it can be applied to AI or NGOs.\n    \n2.  Emoji Introductions: Ask participants to introduce themselves using only emojis. They can choose emojis that represent their name, profession, or interests.\n    \n3.  Picture Perfect: Share a thought-provoking image related to AI or NGO work. Participants take turns describing what they see, how it relates to the workshop, or how it inspires them.\n    \n\nSession 3 (Sunday):\n\n1.  Memory Chain: Start with one participant sharing a word related to AI or NGOs. The next participant adds another word that starts with the last letter of the previous word. Continue the chain until everyone has contributed.\n    \n2.  Quiz Time: Prepare a short quiz with multiple-choice questions about AI and its impact on NGOs. Participants can use the chat function to submit their answers, and discuss the correct answers together afterwards.\n    \n3.  Personal Impact Stories: Each participant shares a personal anecdote or experience where AI has made a positive impact on their work or organization. This encourages reflection and inspires others.\n    \n\nBy incorporating these icebreaker activities, participants will have the opportunity to connect, engage, and contribute their own ideas and experiences.
