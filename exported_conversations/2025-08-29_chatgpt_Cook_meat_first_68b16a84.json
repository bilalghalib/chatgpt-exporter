      "content": "For stuffed tomatoes with ground beef, you’ve got two main options:  \n\n**1. Cook the meat first (recommended if you want a quicker, saucier dish):**  \n- Sauté the ground beef with onion, garlic, and spices until browned.  \n- Mix in rice (parboiled or cooked), herbs (parsley, mint, dill, or basil), maybe a little tomato paste.  \n- Stuff the tomatoes with the mixture and bake until the tomatoes are tender (about 25–35 min at 180–190 °C / 350–375 °F).  \n✅ Pros: safer (no risk of undercooked meat), juicier filling, shorter bake time.  \n\n**2. Use raw meat (traditional in some Mediterranean recipes):**  \n- Mix the raw ground beef with uncooked or parboiled rice, onion, herbs, and spices.  \n- Stuff into the tomatoes and bake longer (45–60 min at 180–190 °C / 350–375 °F). The tomato juices slowly cook and flavor the meat.  \n✅ Pros: flavors meld together beautifully.  \n⚠️ Make sure you bake long enough so the meat cooks through.  \n\n👉 Since you’ve already cored the tomatoes, I’d suggest option 1 if you want something more forgiving and flavorful. If you want the more traditional texture (like Lebanese/Greek stuffed veggies), go with option 2 but give it time.  \n\nDo you want me to give you a quick **spice + herb combo** (Lebanese, Italian, or French-style) to flavor the filling?",

      "content": "Perfect 👌 if you want to **cook the ground beef first**, here’s a simple step-by-step recipe for stuffed tomatoes:  \n\n---\n\n### 🥘 Ingredients (for ~6 medium tomatoes)  \n- 6 large firm tomatoes  \n- 250–300 g ground beef (about ½–⅔ lb)  \n- 1 medium onion, finely chopped  \n- 2 cloves garlic, minced  \n- ½ cup cooked rice (or parboiled, not mushy)  \n- 2 tbsp tomato paste (or the scooped pulp from the tomatoes)  \n- Fresh parsley (or basil/mint/dill), chopped  \n- Olive oil  \n- Salt, black pepper  \n- Optional: a pinch of cinnamon + allspice (Lebanese style) or oregano + thyme (Italian style)  \n\n---\n\n### 🔪 Preparation  \n1. **Prepare tomatoes**:  \n   - Slice off the tops and keep as lids.  \n   - Scoop out pulp with a spoon. Chop it finely and set aside.  \n\n2. **Cook the filling**:  \n   - In a pan, heat 1–2 tbsp olive oil.  \n   - Sauté onion until soft, add garlic.  \n   - Add ground beef, season with salt, pepper, and spices. Cook until browned.  \n   - Stir in tomato pulp (or paste) and let it reduce a little.  \n   - Mix in rice and herbs. Taste and adjust seasoning.  \n\n3. **Stuff tomatoes**:  \n   - Fill each tomato with the mixture, not packed too tightly (it expands a bit).  \n   - Place the tops back on.  \n\n4. **Bake**:  \n   - Arrange in a baking dish, drizzle with olive oil, and add a splash of water or stock at the bottom.  \n   - Bake at **180–190 °C (350–375 °F) for 25–35 minutes**, until the tomatoes are tender but still holding shape.  \n\n5. **Serve**:  \n   - Let them cool for a few minutes before serving so the filling sets.  \n\n---\n\n👉 Do you want me to tailor this more **Lebanese style (warm spices + pine nuts)** or more **French/Italian style (herbs + olive oil)**?",
