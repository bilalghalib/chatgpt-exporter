Ability to adapt materials and training approaches to different cultural contexts, particularly in regions like Ninewa, with sensitivity to local needs and practices. Please explain how you meet this criterion using examples. I do not meet this criterion 1000 characters remaining (Max 1000 Characters) \n\n\nusing this content:\n\nThroughout my work in the SWANA region and beyond, I have developed a strong ability to adapt materials and training approaches to different cultural contexts. This has been particularly important in my work with Bloom, where I have designed and delivered curricula for social entrepreneurs across a wide range of countries and communities.\nOne of the key principles that guides my approach to cultural adaptation is a commitment to centering the needs and perspectives of learners themselves. Rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all curriculum or set of practices, I work closely with learners to understand their unique contexts, challenges, and goals, and to co-create learning experiences that are relevant and meaningful to them.\nThis often involves a significant degree of flexibility and adaptation on my part as a facilitator and curriculum designer. For example, in my work with social entrepreneurs in Lebanon, I have had to navigate complex political and social dynamics, adapting my language, examples, and activities to ensure that they are sensitive to local realities and concerns.\nAt the same time, I have also worked to build a culture of openness, dialogue, and mutual learning in my engagements with learners from different cultural contexts. By creating spaces for honest conversation and exchange, I have been able to foster a sense of trust and collaboration that allows for genuine learning and growth on all sides.\nUltimately, my ability to adapt materials and training approaches to different cultural contexts is grounded in a deep respect for the diversity of human experiences and a commitment to meeting learners where they are. By working collaboratively with learners to design and deliver curricula that are culturally relevant and responsive, I have been able to drive meaningful impact and change in a wide range of contexts. This experience has equipped me with the skills and mindset needed to navigate complex cultural dynamics in service of the UN's objectives.\nCultural Sensitivity in Training\n\nHow can we change materials and training to fit different cultures? First, we need to speak the language and let the learners lead. This helps us be careful with their culture. We don't tell them what to do. We answer their questions. We listen before we give advice.\n\nThe main idea is that the learner should feel in control. They need to believe they can do things on their own. This will help us be more careful with their culture because we will talk less and learn more.\n\nWe shouldn't just try to be careful around other cultures. We should learn from each other. We want to help people find jobs and learn new skills after hard times. To do this, we need to ask questions and listen.\n\nOur training guides show how we put learners in control. We ask them questions and help them think for themselves. This way, we can understand different cultures better and help people learn more.\nA good question helps them find answers. However, mentors should help students to think deeply about different cultures. They should guide them to learn and see that they know the answers.\n\n\nTo score high on this rubric:\nHere's the scoring rubric and plan to help you answer the questions and score 5 on them:\nScoring Rubric:\n\nRelevance and specificity of examples\nDepth of experience and expertise demonstrated\nAlignment with the job requirements and context\nClarity and coherence of the response\nOverall impact and persuasiveness\n\n\nRemember it should only be 100 characters long so pick the highest relevance for scoring high and simple language. It’s for the UN so write professionally too"

Well, first and foremost, we speak the language and we have the program fundamentally be driven by the entrepreneurs. I think this is the most important thing for creating cultural sensitivity. We are not bringing in external trainers to tell them what to do. We are bringing in external trainers to answer their questions. We don't offer our advice until we ask them for their advice. And this is a foundational element in my pedagogical framing and understanding, is that the learner is in the driver's seat. The concept is entrepreneurial self-efficacy. And without entrepreneurial self-efficacy, there is very little that is valuable in an entrepreneur following the guide coming from external places. And this is going to be able to support us in making it culturally sensitive because We will talk less, first of all. That's just the simplest structural difference, but also it is where we will start to learn. It's not about being culturally sensitive. That implies even that we know better and that we are big and that we can accidentally damage something small. And rather than think of things as sensitivity, I think we need to think about it in the framing of exchange, that we are here just as much as they are here to learn. Because the question that we're trying to ask about how do we connect sustainability with creating jobs and learning and skills development for people in a place that are emerging from devastation and violence and the infrastructural destruction is a big question. And I don't think that we need to come in to be sensitive necessarily. I think, yes, we need to speak in Arabic for sure. Yes, there is some element of learning some of the cultural nuances to be able to show that you are connecting and care. But fundamentally, the more deeper care comes from inverting it and asking them questions. And this is foundational in our approach. And to create the structural frameworks within our organization, I have included this in our training manuals for our trainers, which you can see here, and for our mentors. And rather than describe cultural sensitivity, I'm working on creating an approach that puts the learner in the driver's seat, reduces the amount of contribution coming from the mentors and the trainers, and increasing the amount of self-reflection and knowledge, and creating an induced sort of Socratic method where, for sure, if the mentor or trainer is asked a specific question, they can answer. But the more important thing for cultural sensitivity is for the mentors and trainers to be asking them to look within, to ask them to respond, and to ask them the next question that guides them to the next insight that lets them learn that they already knew the answer to their questions all along.",
