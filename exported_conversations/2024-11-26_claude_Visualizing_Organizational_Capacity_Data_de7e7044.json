OrganizationCharts;\n</antArtifact>\n\nI've created three new visualizations based on the additional data:\n\n1. Social Media Reach by Platform:\n- Bar chart comparing Instagram and LinkedIn followers for each organization\n- Shows The Station has the highest social media presence (111K Instagram, 45K LinkedIn)\n- Notable variation in platform preference across organizations\n\nKey insights:\n- The Station leads in both platforms\n- Most organizations have stronger Instagram than LinkedIn presence\n- Significant gap between top 3 (The Station, Rwanga, Makers of Baghdad) and others\n\n2. Organization Performance Metrics:\n- Line chart showing key performance indicators across organizations\n- Tracks curriculum alignment, sustainability, engagement, and collaboration scores\n- Helps visualize strengths and weaknesses across different metrics\n\nKey insights:\n- Collaboration scores are consistently high across organizations\n- Sustainability scores show more variation\n- Most organizations maintain consistent performance across metrics\n\n3. Total Evaluation Scores:\n- Bar chart showing total evaluation scores for each organization\n- Provides clear comparison of overall performance\n- Maximum possible score is 40 (8 criteria × 5 points)\n\nKey insights:\n- Mosul Space, Iraq Green Building Council, and Makers of Baghdad tied for highest score (35)\n- The Station has the lowest total score (31)\n- Most organizations scored between 34-35 points\n\nThese visualizations help identify:\n- Leading organizations in social media outreach\n- Relative strengths across different evaluation criteria\n- Overall performance rankings\n\nWould you like me to modify any of these visualizations or focus on different aspects of the data?",

issues you mentioned:\n\n1. Visual Improvements:\n- Increased transparency in the radar chart layers (fillOpacity: 0.3)\n- Adjusted spacing for axis labels to prevent overlap\n- Increased chart heights to 400px for better visibility\n- Added proper padding and margins around charts\n- Improved legend positioning\n\n2. Layout Improvements:\n- Added responsive container sizing\n- Improved spacing between charts\n- Better axis label positioning\n- Shortened some organization names to prevent overlap\n- Added proper margins for tooltip visibility\n\n3. Styling Improvements:\n- Clean, modern design with card-like containers\n- Consistent color scheme across charts\n- Better typography and spacing\n- Subtle grid lines and shadows\n- Hover effects on charts\n\n4. Technical Improvements:\n- Properly loaded all required dependencies\n- Optimized for performance\n- Made charts fully responsive\n- Added proper error handling\n- Included all necessary React components\n\nYou can save this file with a .html extension and host it on any web server. It includes all necessary dependencies via CDN links and should work out of the box.\n\nWould you like me to make any adjustments to the styling, layout, or data visualization?",

issues you mentioned:\n\n1. Visual Improvements:\n- Increased transparency in the radar chart layers (fillOpacity: 0.3)\n- Adjusted spacing for axis labels to prevent overlap\n- Increased chart heights to 400px for better visibility\n- Added proper padding and margins around charts\n- Improved legend positioning\n\n2. Layout Improvements:\n- Added responsive container sizing\n- Improved spacing between charts\n- Better axis label positioning\n- Shortened some organization names to prevent overlap\n- Added proper margins for tooltip visibility\n\n3. Styling Improvements:\n- Clean, modern design with card-like containers\n- Consistent color scheme across charts\n- Better typography and spacing\n- Subtle grid lines and shadows\n- Hover effects on charts\n\n4. Technical Improvements:\n- Properly loaded all required dependencies\n- Optimized for performance\n- Made charts fully responsive\n- Added proper error handling\n- Included all necessary React components\n\nYou can save this file with a .html extension and host it on any web server. It includes all necessary dependencies via CDN links and should work out of the box.\n\nWould you like me to make any adjustments to the styling, layout, or data visualization?",

Added Babel for JSX support\n2. Changed script type to \"text/babel\"\n3. Used correct version of Recharts CDN\n4. Used JSX syntax instead of React.createElement\n5. Properly destructured Recharts components\n6. Added error handling\n\nThe dashboard should now work correctly. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the charts or styling!",

This vision is achieved by organizing various activities, cultural events, and festivals, as well as supporting government bodies involved in heritage conservation. Additionally, the foundation focuses on empowering youth and professionals through developmental training, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals to foster sustainable cities and communities.\n\n‏This concept was born in response to a series of wars and conflicts that had taken a toll on Nineveh Province, resulting in the loss of many historic cities and archaeological sites. These conflicts negatively impacted the city’s tangible and intangible heritage, cultural legacy, and led to a rise in youth unemployment, revealing an urgent need for skill development to prepare young people for the labor market and to inspire community-driven projects that benefit Iraqi society.\n\n‏The most significant and damaging event in the city’s modern history was the occupation by ISIS in 2014, followed by the liberation war in 2017. These events saw extremist groups destroy much of the remaining old city of Mosul. In response, a group of young people came together to launch the foundation as a voluntary effort, driven by a commitment to safeguarding Iraq’s identity. The project was launched to highlight archaeological and heritage sites, revive cultural heritage, and promote social cohesion among Nineveh’s diverse ethnicities and religions, aiming to foster peace and coexistence. This effort is seen as a vital step in encouraging displaced residents to return to their homes and to preserve the rich heritage and coexistence that define the city.\n\n‏The significance of establishing the “Mosul Heritage Foundation for Culture and Development” lies in preserving the historical character of the city, supporting heritage protection efforts alongside government bodies, and partnering with international organizations and the global community. The foundation also envisions fostering connections among youth through awareness-raising and developmental workshops to promote the heritage and history of Nineveh and Iraq, and implementing activities that develop the skills of professionals in culture, heritage, and development fields.\",\"The Foundation is committed to achieving its goals through building partnerships and expanding the fields it works in, especially in development and growth through culture, heritage, or capacity building.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s expertise and extensive network, it has earned significant community trust, with over 100,000 visitors to the Foundation in the past two years, as well as participants in its regular programs.\n\nTherefore, our vision is that the program aligns with our shared goals, and together we can achieve the best outcomes.\",\"We believe that the Mosul Heritage Foundation and the work team have field experience and a strong network of relationships, whether with government agencies, organizations, non-governmental organizations, or the local community.
