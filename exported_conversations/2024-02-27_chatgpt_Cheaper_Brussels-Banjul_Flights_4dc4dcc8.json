      "content": "The phenomenon you're describing is known as \"hidden city ticketing.\" It's a situation where a flight from Point A to Point C, with a layover at Point B, is cheaper than a flight from Point B to Point C. This pricing anomaly can occur due to various factors in airline pricing strategies. Here's a breakdown of why this happens and what you should consider:\n\n1. **Airline Pricing Strategies**: Airlines use complex pricing algorithms that consider demand, competition, and other factors. A flight from Brussels to Banjul via Casablanca might be priced competitively to attract more customers, while the direct flight from Casablanca to Banjul may have less competition or higher demand, leading to higher prices.\n\n2. **Market Competition**: In some cases, the route from Point A to Point C might have more competition, prompting airlines to offer lower prices to attract customers. The route from Point B to Point C might have less competition, allowing airlines to charge more.\n\n3. **Demand and Supply**: The demand for flights from Brussels to Banjul might be different from the demand for flights from Casablanca to Banjul. Airlines adjust their prices based on how many people want to fly a particular route.\n\nRegarding getting the cheaper ticket through hidden city ticketing (i.e., booking a flight from Brussels to Banjul and getting off at Casablanca), there are several things to consider:\n\n- **Risks and Airline Policies**: Hidden city ticketing is generally frowned upon by airlines. It can lead to consequences such as voiding the rest of your ticket, losing frequent flyer points, or even facing action from the airline. It's important to read the airline's terms and conditions.\n\n- **Luggage**: If you check in luggage, it will usually be sent to the final destination (Banjul in your case). This strategy only works if you're traveling with carry-on luggage.\n\n- **Return Flights**: If your itinerary includes a return flight, not completing one leg of your journey (like getting off at Casablanca) could result in the cancellation of your remaining flights.\n\nTo find the best price for your intended route (Brussels to Banjul via Casablanca), you can try the following:\n\n- **Use Flight Comparison Websites**: Websites like Skyscanner, Google Flights, or Kayak can help you find the best deals. They allow you to compare prices across different airlines and dates.\n\n- **Flexible Dates**: If you're flexible with your travel dates, you might find cheaper options.\n\n- **Airline Promotions**: Keep an eye on promotions or deals offered by airlines.\n\n- **Travel Agents**: Sometimes, travel agents have access to deals or pricing not available publicly.\n\nRemember, while hidden city ticketing can sometimes offer cheaper fares, it's important to be aware of the potential risks and airline policies.",
