I wanted to follow up on our recent conversation and outline the next steps we discussed. Below are the key points:\n\n1.⁠ ⁠Solar System ROI and Cost Calculations: We agreed on the importance of communicating the ROI (18 months for standard systems, 2-3 years for hybrid, and 4-4.5 years for off-grid). It would be helpful if you could share specific cost data and any available tools from Kesk that highlight these calculations.\n\n2.⁠ ⁠Battery Misconceptions: As we discussed, the challenge of overcoming outdated beliefs about battery replacement frequency (lead-acid vs. lithium) is crucial. Perhaps we could create a short communication piece to address this misconception and educate potential customers.\n\n3.⁠ ⁠Solar Water Heating: You mentioned that while this technology is valuable, it requires more awareness and consumer interest. Would it make sense to include this topic in our future outreach and marketing materials?\n\n4.⁠ ⁠Training and Education: I’m moving forward with developing a short introductory module on solar energy, as we discussed. Once ready, I’ll share the draft for your feedback. Additionally, I’d love your input on how we can collaborate on more in-depth technical training (e.g., system design and sizing) for professionals. Let me know if Kesk would be interested in co-hosting or leading a session.\n\n5.⁠ ⁠Partnership with Banks: It’s exciting to hear about Kesk’s pilot initiative with the Iraqi bank. When you're ready to make this public, I’d be happy to help amplify this news through my network and possibly integrate this into future trainings or presentations.\n\n6.⁠ ⁠Validation and Feedback: Once I finalize the solar training module, I will create a simple feedback form to gather input. I'd appreciate if you could review it and provide any recommendations on the solar component.\n\n7.⁠ ⁠Content for Curriculum: I’m also working on including real images and case studies from Kesk’s installations for the curriculum. Let’s coordinate a time during my visit to Iraq to capture some photos at your office or at a site.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any additional points you’d like to discuss or if you need any further clarification on these items. I’m excited about the next steps and look forward to our continued collaboration.\n\nBest regards",

Just a quick follow-up on our chat. A few key things:\n\n1. Could you share any cost data and tools from Kesk that show ROI for solar systems? It’ll be helpful for our messaging.\n2. About battery misconceptions—we talked about creating a short piece to address this. Would love to get your thoughts on that.\n3. For the solar training module I’m developing, I’ll send a draft soon. Would Kesk be interested in co-hosting a deeper technical session with me?\n\nLooking forward to the next steps!\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name] \n\n---\n\nThis version keeps it light while highlighting the main points without overwhelming.",
