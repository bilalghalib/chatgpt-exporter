How can i formualte this so it sounds as meaningful as it is?\nDo we need to tell them things like this is how you learn what you don't yet know to do what you can't yet do. Do we need to derive principles or higherlever order ideas, maybe first principles. What' s unique about this prompt technique? Do we need to add additional value for early stage entrepreneurs, thi sis a prompt for early phase startups. Perhaps different types of roles in a startup/that a startup might need to hire (designers, etc). Do we also need to tell them different types of organizational documents that will help them have a \"kit\" of things to build out for their business. requirements docs, style guides, what are at least 8 others? Think through step by step, break this down into individual brainstorming processes and let's review before working on each step individually \n\nPersona-Driven AI Collaboration: A Step-by-Step Guide\nPrompting is an art. \nYou will be working WITH machines, it will not replace you (yet).\nHow to know what you don’t know to do what you can’t do prompt tips.\nBig ideas:\nGet it into the right persona. \nChunk your prompt project into smaller components and don’t move forward till you have good results, edit the prompt and resubmit if needed.\nGet it to explain its work \nGet appropriate critique from another persona. \nGet it to help you if you don’t know what you don’t know\nPut yourself into the feedback loop. \nGet diversity - ask for orthogonality. \nAdd your ideas here. \n\nPrompt: Ask it to take on a persona\nObjective: Give it the information it needs dependant on the domain knowledge\nPrompt: Define domain knowledge\nBuild a “one pager” defining your goal. For code it’s a requirements doc, for a design it’s  style guide, etc… If you don’t know ask what type of documentation it would create if it were a (persona working on specific project type here).\nGet it to review that guide and create 5 pros and 5 cons and then to critique it step by step. \n(LOOP Prompt) Ask it to ask you to review the 5 pros and 5 cons and then work with it to improve the guide in a loop . Same thing 4 Pros 5 cons and your input reviewing them and telling them which pros and cons matter most. \nAppropriate Critique. Ask it to take on the persona of an appropriate reviewer (for a graphic design persona it might be their boss, the art director for instance)\nThen review with it the guide/proposal for work.\nBreak down your job into individual optimizable components. For instance in a logo there’s the icon and the text. In code there may be database architecture and then individual algorithms. Ask GPT for help to break your job down into subtasks.\nThen ask it to develop prompts to “enact” the work for each subtask. \nDiversity: Ask it to define three orthogonal higher level objectives and approaches for the prompts, to write the approach, the name and then prompt.\n(Bonus, feed it the learnprompting.org website content and ask it to derive principles from it that are best suited from your project, and then ask it to implement the prompts).\nFinally, take your prompt to a new GPT/Agent(or real human, it’s useful for them too!) and then ask it to do the work. Review and loop(step by step, 5pros 5 cons, etc and loop back to where you need to review).\n",

      "content": "To create an inspirational and practical one-page guide based on the text you've provided, I'll break down the process into several steps, each focusing on a key aspect of the guide. This approach will help us ensure that the final product is both meaningful and useful, especially for early-stage entrepreneurs.\n\n### Step 1: Establishing the Core Message\nThe core message seems to be about leveraging AI, specifically in the form of persona-driven collaboration, to enhance the startup process. This involves understanding how to effectively use AI as a tool for various tasks and not as a replacement for human creativity and decision-making.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Key Principles and Concepts\nFrom the text, we can extract several key principles:\n\n1. **Persona-Driven Collaboration**: Using AI as a partner, adopting various personas as needed.\n2. **Chunking Projects**: Breaking down large tasks into manageable subtasks.\n3. **Feedback Loops**: Continuously refining ideas and documents through iterative feedback.\n4. **Diversity in Thought**: Seeking different perspectives and orthogonal approaches.\n5. **Document Types for Startups**: Identifying essential documents like requirements docs, style guides, etc.\n\n### Step 3: Additional Value for Early-Stage Entrepreneurs\nFor early-stage entrepreneurs, we need to provide practical advice and tools. This includes:\n\n- Types of roles and skills needed in a startup (e.g., designers, developers).\n- Essential organizational documents and their purposes.\n\n### Step 4: Listing Essential Documents\nWe should list at least eight types of documents vital for startups:\n\n1. Business Plan\n2. Market Analysis Report\n3. Financial Projections\n4. Product Requirements Document\n5. Style Guide for Design\n6. Technology Stack Outline\n7. Human Resource Management Plan\n8. Risk Management Plan\n\n### Step 5: Formulating the Guide\nWith these elements in mind, the guide can be structured as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction**: A brief explanation of the importance of AI collaboration in startups.\n2. **Core Principles**: Highlighting the principles of persona-driven AI collaboration.\n3. **Practical Steps**: Step-by-step guide on using AI for various startup tasks.\n4. **Essential Documents**: List and description of key documents for startups.\n5. **Closing Thoughts**: Inspirational message emphasizing the blend of AI and human creativity.\n\n### Step 6: Drafting the Guide\nNow, I'll draft the guide based on these steps. The goal is to create a concise, yet comprehensive, one-page document that is both inspirational and practical for early-stage entrepreneurs.\n\n---\n\n**Persona-Driven AI Collaboration: A Guide for Startups**\n\n*Embrace the Future of Entrepreneurship with AI as Your Ally*\n\n**Introduction**\nIn the fast-paced world of startups, AI isn't just a tool; it's a partner. This guide introduces you to the art of persona-driven AI collaboration, empowering you to uncover unknowns and enhance your creative process.\n\n**Core Principles**\n1. **Adopt Diverse Personas**: Use AI to simulate different roles, gaining varied insights.\n2. **Chunk Your Project**: Break your vision into smaller, manageable tasks.\n3. **Embrace Feedback Loops**: Continually refine through AI-assisted reviews.\n4. **Seek Diverse Perspectives**: Challenge your ideas with orthogonal AI approaches.\n\n**Practical Steps for Startups**\n- Define your startup's needs and use AI to adopt relevant personas (e.g., designer, developer).\n- Use AI to generate and critique essential documents, iterating with both AI and human feedback.\n- Break down tasks into sub-components for focused AI collaboration.\n\n**Essential Documents for Your Startup**\n1. Business Plan: Your roadmap to success.\n2. Market Analysis: Understand your competition.\n3. Financial Projections: Plan your financial future.\n4. Product Requirements: Detail what you're building.\n5. Style Guide: Keep your brand consistent.\n6. Technology Stack: Outline your tech needs.\n7. HR Plan: Manage your most valuable asset – people.\n8. Risk Plan: Anticipate and mitigate risks.\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\nIn the journey of entrepreneurship, AI is your collaborator, not your competitor. Use it to explore the uncharted, refine your vision, and bring your unique ideas to life. Remember, the future belongs to those who innovate by blending the best of technology and human ingenuity.\n\n*Your ideas, AI's insights – together, we build the future.*\n\n---\n\nThis draft is intended to be inspirational, informative, and a practical guide for early-stage startups in utilizing AI effectively. Feel free to modify or expand upon this draft to better suit your specific needs or audience.",

(you are a professional graphic designer…) \n\n LLM AI works best when you do some work in advance. How can you do that?\nTell it what logos you like, then ask it to break it down. For instance, you can give it an image and ask it to think step by step about creating a prompt to generate this image. \nYou can mimic styles by saying “in the style of” \n\n\nSplit the prompt into two tasks: \nOne for the text\nOne for the icon\n\n\nGive it themes:\nA logo for a bicycle brand, simple, vector, Pop Art (themes)\nExample prompting: \nHow Bilal would have gone about building the prompt:\nProfessional Network Hub with Brand Name:\nDescription: Create a logo with the UAE map subtly outlined in the background in sleek black or dark grey. Overlay a stylized network pattern in white or a light shade, connecting various points to symbolize interconnected SMEs. Include the brand name \"WATANLY\" prominently.\nStyle Reference: Inspired by the modern, professional style of Paul Rand or Massimo Vignelli. The design should be minimalist and elegant.\nSpecific Details: The map should be recognizable but not dominant. Focus on the network lines as the main feature. Place the brand name \"WATANLY\" at the bottom of the logo, in a bold, sans-serif font, ensuring it's easily readable against the background. The color of the text should be in contrast to the background, preferably white or a light shade.\nGrowth and Aspiration Symbol with Brand Name:\nDescription: Design a minimalist logo combining an upward arrow and a simplified UAE map. The arrow indicates growth and aspiration. Integrate the brand name \"WATANLY\" within the design.\nStyle Reference: Minimalist and contemporary, akin to the Bauhaus school. Focus on clarity and precision, similar to Herbert Bayer or Josef Albers.\nSpecific Details: Seamlessly blend the upward arrow with the UAE map. The brand name \"WATANLY\" should be positioned either horizontally at the base of the logo or along the side of the arrow, depending on which looks more harmonious. Use a modern, sans-serif font for the name, in black or white to maintain the monochromatic theme.\nContemporary Geometric Map with Brand Name:\nDescription: Develop a modern, geometric interpretation of the UAE map using sharp, angular lines. Integrate the brand name \"WATANLY\" into the design.\nStyle Reference: Geometric abstraction, drawing on styles of Kazimir Malevich or Piet Mondrian. Emphasize bold geometric shapes and clean lines.\nSpecific Details: The map should be stylized using geometric forms, with the brand name \"WATANLY\" incorporated within or below the design. The name could be part of the geometric pattern or placed underneath the map, in a clear, modern sans-serif font. The text color should be black or white, depending on the background for contrast and readability.\n\nGive it an identity: \nReference for Prompting: Bilal example: \nYou are a professional graphic designer and are helping me define the logo for Watanly. I have a business called Watanly. It's a platform providing comprehensively tailored growth opportunities to local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UAE. Can you help me come up with 5 creative ideas for logos that utilize the map of the UAE region? Think through step by step what our objectives are. What are the 5 fundamental questions a graphic designer needs to know to create an ideal logo, ask those questions and we’ll use the results in the following prompts to create logo. \nChatGPT\nAbsolutely, I'd be happy to help you brainstorm creative ideas for the Watanly logo. To ensure the logo aligns perfectly with your brand's vision and objectives, let's consider some key factors:\nBrand Message and Values: What are the core values of Watanly? This will help in determining the tone and style of the logo. Since Watanly is about growth opportunities for SMEs in the UAE, concepts like growth, connectivity, support, and innovation might be central.\nTarget Audience: Who are your primary customers? Understanding your audience will guide the design to appeal directly to them. Are they young entrepreneurs, established businesses, or a mix of both?\nColor Scheme and Style Preferences: Do you have any specific colors or styles in mind? Colors can have a significant impact on brand perception. For example, green can signify growth and prosperity, while blue can represent trust and professionalism.\nUAE Map Integration: How prominently would you like the map of the UAE region to feature in your logo? This could range from a subtle reference to a central element of the design.\nUnique Selling Points (USPs): What makes Watanly stand out from competitors? Highlighting these in the logo can make it more memorable.\nBased on these considerations, here are five creative logo ideas:\nInterconnected Network Design: Use the UAE map as a backdrop with lines connecting various points on the map, symbolizing the network of SMEs.

This can be a subtle yet powerful representation of your core value.\nModern Minimalist Map: A sleek, minimalist design where the outline of the UAE region is stylized in a modern, abstract way. This can appeal to a contemporary audience and reflect innovation.\nCultural Fusion Emblem: Incorporate traditional UAE patterns or motifs into the map design, celebrating the rich cultural heritage of the region while also symbolizing the support for local businesses.\nDynamic Dot-and-Line Map: Create a dynamic logo where the UAE map is depicted using dots (representing SMEs) connected by lines (symbolizing opportunities and connections). This could be more abstract but very visually engaging.\nFor any of these ideas, the text \"Watanly\" can be integrated in a complementary font, balancing modernity with readability.\nIf you have any preferences or additional information, please let me know, and we can refine these ideas further!\n\n1.

Based on your feedback, here are the refined logo ideas for Watanly, keeping in mind the brand message, target audience, color scheme, and varying levels of prominence for the UAE map:\nProfessional Network Hub: Design a logo where the UAE map is subtly outlined in the background in a sleek black or dark grey. Over this map, a stylized network pattern in white or a light shade connects various points, symbolizing the interconnected nature of SMEs in the region. This design is professional and speaks to the idea of a supportive network for growing businesses.\nGrowth and Aspiration Symbol: Create a minimalist icon that combines an upward arrow (signifying growth and aspiration) with a simplified outline of the UAE map. This could be a more abstract representation, using clean lines and minimal colors, aligning with a professional and modern aesthetic.\nContemporary Geometric Map: Develop a modern, geometric interpretation of the UAE map, using sharp, angular lines in black and white. This design would be more abstract, focusing on the artistic representation of the region while conveying a sense of sophistication and cutting-edge business support.\nElegant Cultural Emblem: Integrate a subtle element of traditional UAE art or architecture, stylized in a modern way, within or alongside a minimalistic representation of the map. This design can be a fusion of cultural heritage with a modern, professional look, using minimal colors to maintain elegance.\nDynamic Connectivity Icon: Craft a dynamic emblem where simplified dots (representing SMEs) are interconnected with lines (symbolizing growth opportunities) across a stylized UAE map. This design could vary in the level of map prominence, from a clear outline to a more abstract background element, using black, white, and perhaps a hint of another color for emphasis.\nFor each design, the \"Watanly\" text will be incorporated in a clean, modern font, complementing the logo's minimalistic and professional style. The overall look will be sleek, appealing to early and growing small/mid-sized businesses, and reflecting the brand's encouraging and professional ethos.\nFeel free to share any more thoughts or preferences you might have!\n\nCan you create a prompt including designer references and styles to send to a graphic design LLM to help it create the logo? Think step by step about what features need to be included, including a style reference and specific details, and then create a prompt for These three: Professional Network Hub: Design a logo where the UAE map is subtly outlined in the background in a sleek black or dark grey. Over this map, a stylized network pattern in white or a light shade connects various points, symbolizing the interconnected nature of SMEs in the region. This professional design speaks to the idea of a supportive network for growing businesses. Growth and Aspiration Symbol: Create a minimalist icon that combines an upward arrow (signifying growth and aspiration) with a simplified outline of the UAE map. This could be a more abstract representation, using clean lines and minimal colors, aligning with a professional and modern aesthetic. Contemporary Geometric Map: Develop a modern, geometric interpretation of the UAE map, using sharp, angular lines in black and white. This design would be more abstract, focusing on the artistic representation of the region while conveying a sense of sophistication and cutting-edge business support.\nChatGPT\nCertainly, crafting detailed prompts for each of these logo concepts is essential for guiding the graphic design LLM to create visuals that align closely with your vision. Here are the prompts for the three logo designs:\nProfessional Network Hub:\nDescription: Create a logo featuring the UAE map subtly outlined in the background in sleek black or dark grey. Over this map, overlay a stylized network pattern in white or a light shade, with lines connecting various points. The design should symbolize the interconnected nature of SMEs in the UAE region and convey a sense of a supportive network for growing businesses.\nStyle Reference: The style should be modern and professional, drawing inspiration from the clean lines and simplicity found in the works of designers like Paul Rand or Massimo Vignelli. The network pattern should be elegant and minimalist, avoiding clutter while effectively conveying connectivity.\nSpecific Details: Ensure the UAE map is recognizable but not overpowering. The network lines should be the focal point, suggesting a web of connections across the region. The logo should be primarily black and white, with potential for subtle shades of grey to add depth.\nGrowth and Aspiration Symbol:\nDescription: Design a minimalist logo icon that combines an upward arrow with a simplified outline of the UAE map. The arrow symbolizes growth and aspiration, while the map represents the regional focus of the business. The representation should be abstract, using clean lines and a minimal color palette.\nStyle Reference: Embrace a minimalist and contemporary style, reminiscent of the Bauhaus school, focusing on function and simplicity. The logo should echo the clarity and precision seen in the works of Herbert Bayer or Josef Albers.\nSpecific Details: The upward arrow should be integrated seamlessly with the UAE map, possibly forming part of the map's outline or emerging from it. Stick to a monochromatic scheme, primarily using black and white, to maintain the logo’s professional and modern look.\nContemporary Geometric Map:\nDescription: Develop a logo with a modern, geometric interpretation of the UAE map. Use sharp, angular lines to create an abstract representation of the region. The design should focus on artistic representation while conveying sophistication and support for cutting-edge business.\nStyle Reference: The logo should draw on the geometric abstraction style, taking cues from artists like Kazimir Malevich or Piet Mondrian. The focus should be on bold geometric shapes and clean lines, creating a striking and modern aesthetic.\nSpecific Details: The UAE map should be recognizable but artistically stylized using geometric forms. The color scheme should be strictly black and white, emphasizing contrast and the interplay of shapes and lines. The design should balance between being abstract and identifiable as the UAE region.\nThese prompts provide a clear direction for the graphic design LLM, ensuring that each logo concept is developed with the appropriate style, symbolism, and professional aesthetic that aligns with the Watanly brand.\n\nUpdate the prompts so it also includes the name WATANLY and describe its position in detail so the AI gets it right\nChatGPT\nSure, I'll update each prompt to include specific instructions about integrating the name \"WATANLY\" into the logo designs:\nProfessional Network Hub with Brand Name:\nDescription: Create a logo with the UAE map subtly outlined in the background in sleek black or dark grey. Overlay a stylized network pattern in white or a light shade, connecting various points to symbolize interconnected SMEs. Include the brand name \"WATANLY\" prominently.\nSpecific Details: Seamlessly blend the upward arrow with the UAE map. The brand name \"WATANLY\" should be positioned either horizontally at the base of the logo or along the side of the arrow, depending on which looks more harmonious. Use a modern, sans-serif font for the name, in black or white to maintain the monochromatic theme.\nContemporary Geometric Map with Brand Name:\nDescription: Develop a modern, geometric interpretation of the UAE map using sharp, angular lines.

This guide introduces you to the art of persona-driven AI collaboration, empowering you to uncover unknowns and enhance your creative process.\n\nCore Principles\nAdopt Diverse Personas: Use AI to simulate different roles, gaining varied insights.\nChunk Your Project: Break your vision into smaller, manageable tasks.\nEmbrace Feedback Loops: Continually refine through AI-assisted reviews.\nSeek Diverse Perspectives: Challenge your ideas with orthogonal AI approaches.\nLook Under The Hood: Ask the AI to explain its work, find pros/cons, and critique itself\nPractical Steps for Startups\nDefine your startup's needs and use AI to adopt relevant personas (e.g., designer, developer).\nUse AI to generate and critique essential documents, iterating with both AI and human feedback.\nBreak down tasks into sub-components for focused AI collaboration.\nEssential Documents for Your Startup\nBusiness Plan: Your roadmap to success.\nMarket Analysis: Understand your competition.\nFinancial Projections: Plan your financial future.\nProduct Requirements: Detail what you're building.\nStyle Guide: Keep your brand consistent.\nTechnology Stack: Outline your tech needs.\nHR Plan: Manage your most valuable asset – people.\nRisk Plan: Anticipate and mitigate risks.\nClosing Thoughts\nIn the entrepreneurship journey, AI is your collaborator. Use it to explore the uncharted, refine your vision, and bring your unique ideas to life. \n\n\nPrompting is an art. \nYou will be working WITH machines, it will not replace you (yet).\nHow to know what you don’t know to do what you can’t do prompt tips.\nBig ideas:\nGet it into the right persona. \nChunk your prompt project into smaller components and don’t move forward till you have good results, edit the prompt and resubmit if needed.\nGet it to explain its work \nGet appropriate critique from another persona. \nGet it to help you if you don’t know what you don’t know\nPut yourself into the feedback loop. \nGet diversity - ask for orthogonality. \nAdd your ideas here…\n\nPrompt: Ask it to take on a persona\nObjective: Give it the information it needs dependant on the domain knowledge\nPrompt: Define domain knowledge\nBuild a “one pager” defining your goal. For code it’s a requirements doc, for a design it’s  style guide, etc… If you don’t know ask what type of documentation it would create if it were a (persona working on specific project type here).\nGet it to review that guide and create 5 pros and 5 cons and then to critique it step by step. \n(LOOP Prompt) Ask it to ask you to review the 5 pros and 5 cons and then work with it to improve the guide in a loop . Same thing 4 Pros 5 cons and your input reviewing them and telling them which pros and cons matter most. \nAppropriate Critique. Ask it to take on the persona of an appropriate reviewer (for a graphic design persona it might be their boss, the art director for instance)\nThen review with it the guide/proposal for work.\nBreak down your job into individual optimizable components. For instance in a logo there’s the icon and the text. In code there may be database architecture and then individual algorithms. Ask GPT for help to break your job down into subtasks.\nThen ask it to develop prompts to “enact” the work for each subtask. \nDiversity: Ask it to define three orthogonal higher level objectives and approaches for the prompts, to write the approach, the name and then prompt.\n(Bonus, feed it the learnprompting.org website content and ask it to derive principles from it that are best suited from your project, and then ask it to implement the prompts).\nFinally, take your prompt to a new GPT/Agent(or real human, it’s useful for them too!) and then ask it to do the work. Review and loop(step by step, 5pros 5 cons, etc and loop back to where you need to review).\n\n\nAnd update the markdown to demo that",
