How did this realization change the way you think about your values?\n2. Have you ever noticed that your behavior changes when you're around certain people? What does this say about the values that you prioritize?\n3. Think about a time when you felt truly happy and fulfilled. What values were being met during that experience, and how can you incorporate those values into your daily life?\n4. What are some things that you are willing to sacrifice for, even if they're difficult or uncomfortable? What does this say about the values that you hold dear?\n5. Have you ever found yourself acting in a way that contradicts your beliefs? What does this say about the values that you prioritize?\n6. Think about a time when you made a mistake. How did your values play a role in your decision-making process, and what did you learn about yourself as a result?\n7. Have you ever made a decision that you later regretted? What does this say about the values that you were prioritizing at the time?\n8. What are some things that you are willing to stand up for, even if it means going against the crowd? What does this say about the values that you hold dear?\n9. Have you ever felt torn between two values? How did you ultimately decide which value was more important to you?\n10. Think about a time when you had to make a compromise. What does this say about the values that you were willing to sacrifice, and which values were non-negotiable for you?",
