Develop AR/VR sustainability experiences and 3D models/designs for sustainable heritage architecture and home construction.\n\n8. Recommendations\n8.1 Preferred Implementation Partners\nMosul Space: Recommended as the Lead Implementing Partner for training delivery, focusing on practical applications, technology integration, and community engagement. They should incorporate traditional building techniques and sustainability philosophy into training modules, collaborating with organizations like the Mosul Heritage Foundation and participants from the Sustainability Meetup.\nQaf Lab: Recommended as an alternative Lead Implementing Partner or as a Co-Implementing Partner, bringing expertise in sustainability, green technologies, and business incubation. They could emphasize innovative solutions, such as developing AR/VR experiences and 3D models to visualize sustainable heritage architecture and home construction.\n8.2 Partnership Strategy\nBuild Ecosystems of Sustainability\nLeverage different organizations for their skills and capacity to strengthen the ecosystem for sustainable construction and development.\nIntegration of Traditional and Modern Practices:\nCollaborate with the Mosul Heritage Foundation, and other local heritage buildings with training sites, to utilize their venue and expertise.\nPromotion of Innovation and Technology:\nUtilize Qaf Lab's expertise in AR/VR to create immersive educational experiences.\nCommunity Ownership\nFoster ownership and sustainability for involved partner organizations.\nAllow partners to adapt and iterate on training content and develop their own advocacy and outreach strategies.\nIncorporation of Sustainability Philosophy:\nEmbed a sustainability mindset in all training programs (no plastic plates, recycled printed material, and other subtle queues to demonstrate sustainability at the core of the project).\n8.3 Risk Assessment and Mitigation\nCultural Resistance to Modern Designs\nRisk: Preference for traditional aesthetics may hinder the adoption of modern sustainable practices.\nMitigation:\nIntegrate traditional designs with modern sustainability techniques.\nUse successful local examples to demonstrate benefits.\nEconomic Barriers\nRisk: High initial costs of sustainable materials and technologies may limit adoption.\nMitigation:\nInclude cost-benefit analyses in training.\nExplore affordable local materials and solutions.\n\n\n9. Conclusion\nThe expanded mission, including the Sustainability Meetup on October 26th and the follow-up Meeting with Stakeholders on November 2-3rd, helped successfully identify and assess potential implementing partners in Ninewa with the capacity, expertise, and commitment to support the BEIT project's objectives. Integrating insights from diverse stakeholders underscores the importance of deepening ecosystemic ties by leveraging the dynamic ecosystem in Mosul and Iraq for each identified stakeholder’s strengths.  \nThe recommended implementation partners are Mosul Space and Qaf Lab while Makers of Baghdad, and the Mosul Heritage Foundation are recommended for business research and training site location respectively. Together they are well-positioned to implement relevant training programs, practically applicable, and aligned with local needs and global sustainability standards.\nBy formalizing these partnerships with ITC the BEIT project has great partners in advocating, training, and nurturing businesses that can promote sustainable home reconstruction post-conflict and take significant strides in fostering sustainable reconstruction, economic growth, and a philosophical shift toward sustainability in Ninewa and beyond.\n\n10.
