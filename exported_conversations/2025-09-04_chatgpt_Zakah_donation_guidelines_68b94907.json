      "content": "Great question, Bilal. Let’s unpack this carefully so you can be sure:  \n\n---\n\n### **1. What counts as Zakah?**\nZakah is a **specific form of worship and obligation**. It is not just any charity (ṣadaqah). For a payment to qualify as Zakah:  \n\n- **It must be given with the intention of Zakah (niyyah).**  \n- **It must go to eligible recipients** mentioned in the Qur’an (9:60).  \n\nThose categories are:  \n\n1. **The poor (fuqarāʾ)** – those who have nothing.  \n2. **The needy (masākīn)** – those who have some, but not enough.  \n3. **Zakah administrators** – those employed to collect/distribute it.  \n4. **Those whose hearts are to be reconciled** – new Muslims or people who may incline toward Islam if supported.  \n5. **Captives/slaves** – historically, for freeing people from bondage; today, some scholars extend this to those in oppressive constraints.  \n6. **Debtors** – people in legitimate debt with no means to repay.  \n7. **In the path of Allah (fī sabīlillāh)** – classically military defense, but modern scholars extend to daʿwah, education, humanitarian aid, refugees, etc.  \n8. **The stranded traveler** – even if normally wealthy, but stranded without resources.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Donating to someone in conflict areas for shelter/moving**\n- If the person **cannot afford to move or shelter themselves**, and they **fall below their basic needs**, then yes—they qualify under **fuqarāʾ or masākīn**.  \n- If they are **in debt from trying to survive or relocate**, they could qualify under **gharimīn (debtors)**.  \n- If you support them to **escape oppression or captivity**, it could also fall under **riqāb (freeing captives)** in a modern interpretation.  \n- If you give to an **aid organization that is trustworthy and explicitly collects/distributes Zakah**, then your donation through them counts too.  \n\nSo yes—helping someone relocate to safety and secure shelter *can* count as Zakah **if the recipient is genuinely needy and you intend it as Zakah**.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. How to be sure your payment counts as Zakah**\n- **Check your niyyah (intention):** Before giving, say to yourself (or in duʿāʾ), *“This is from my Zakah.”*  \n- **Ensure the recipient is eligible:** Poor, needy, in debt, stranded, etc.  \n- **Give directly or through a trusted channel:** If directly, you need to be reasonably sure of their situation. If through an NGO, confirm they distribute Zakah according to Islamic guidelines.  \n- **Amount calculation:** Make sure you’ve properly calculated your Zakah (2.5% of qualifying wealth after one lunar year).  \n\n---\n\n✅ **So in your case**:  \nDonating to someone in a conflict zone to help them relocate and find shelter *can absolutely count as Zakah* if they don’t have enough means to cover that need themselves, and if you intend it as such.  \n\n---\n\nWould you like me to also share a **step-by-step checklist** (like a quick “Zakah eligibility flowchart”) that you can use before giving, so you always feel sure about your Zakah payments?",
