The SCRIBER framework provides an excellent foundation for guided learning, while the Yin-Yang analysis helps maintain balance between creative exploration and critical thinking. I'm particularly excited about:\n\nHow Vector Space Navigation could make learning paths visible and navigable\nThe potential for \"aha moments\" to be captured and tracked\nThe opportunity to help people find their unique voice beyond the existing embedding space\n\nCritical Mind: While the vision is compelling, we need to focus on concrete next steps and validation. Some key concerns:\n\nThe patentable elements need technical specificity\nWe need clear user stories and monetization paths\nThe implementation complexity could be overwhelming\n\nLet me create a more detailed artifact looking at our next steps:Decision Tree for Next StepsClick to open componentCritical Mind: Looking at this decision tree, I think our next crucial questions should be:\n\nFor Validation: Can we identify 5-10 potential early adopters for interviews this week?\nFor Technical: What's the smallest possible MVP that demonstrates our unique value proposition?\nFor Business: Which pricing model allows for rapid iteration while sustaining development?\n\nCreative Mind: Yes, and we could enhance our validation by:\n\nCreating \"learning journey maps\" with early users to visualize their paths\nUsing the SCRIBER framework itself to guide our development process\nBuilding a community of practice around this new way of learning\n\nWould you like to focus on any particular aspect of this plan? I think the most crucial next step is validating our assumptions with potential users while keeping our technical implementation lean. CopyRetryBGwe dont' even know what we're building yet. I sort of think something that either replaces people's use of standard LLMs and does this \"on the backend\" and then sends them periodic emails or creates podcasts to help them see what they saw or something. Or find the principles in the idea here and come up with 3 other ways that follow them - i sort of dont' want to create any friction or additional work, i wonder if the heavy users of LLMs are enough and feel enough of this overwhelm problem, and if there are enough of them for a product and what the rest of the people who are not heavy llm users might be? like th elong tail besides the few early adopters who already use llms well and feel the pain of too much information too little action feel like they get ahas they lose etc also people who don't feel ahas with llms because they prompt poorly yeah let's think about community of practice we also need to address how i actually work what skills and resources and communities i have access to and what makes actual sense rather than hypothetical sense for a random perosnEditLet me use both minds to explore this further.\nCreative Mind: What's exciting here is we're identifying a core human need that emerges when interfacing with LLMs - the difference between accumulating information and actual growth/transformation. Let's map out different user archetypes and potential solutions!User Archetypes and Solution SpacesClick to open diagramCritical Mind: Looking at your background and constraints, let's analyze three concrete potential directions:\n\n\"Insight Miner\" Chrome Extension\n\n\nLeverages your technical background\nLow barrier to entry for users\nSimple to distribute\nClear value prop: \"Never lose an insight again\"\nPotential immediate revenue through Chrome Store\n\n\nLearning Community Platform\n\n\nBuilds on your educational experience\nCreates network effects\nHigher development effort\nRequires community building skills\nLonger path to revenue\n\n\nAI-Enhanced Content Creation\n\n\nUses your writing/teaching background\nLower technical complexity\nClear deliverable (podcasts/newsletters)\nEasier to test with minimal investment\nDirect monetization path\nOpportunity Evaluation MatrixClick to open componentCreative Mind: Looking at these options, I see exciting possibilities for combining approaches! What if we:\n\nStart with the Chrome extension to build user base and validate pain points\nUse the insights gathered to create valuable content\nNaturally grow a community around the shared practices\n\nCritical Mind: But we should validate some key assumptions first:\n\nHow many power users are actually losing valuable insights?\nWhat's the minimum feature set that provides value?\nHow much would people pay for this solution?\n\nWould you like to focus on validating any of these approaches? The Chrome extension seems like the lowest-hanging fruit with your technical background, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on which direction resonates most with your goals and capabilities. CopyRetryBGAlright. So let's think about this. We could start with the Chrome extension to build the user base, but, like, how many people actually use Chrome? Insights gathered to create new valuable content, What's the content? What actual insights can we make that you think would generate content? Grow a community around the share practice. So I've you know, me and most people are very busy and you know, I've run accelerated for months months, and people join and become a part of it, and then we create these WhatsApp group. So we try to invite people to activities and events and it just doesn't work. Like, people don't have the capacity for this kind of community of practice. And I feel like more and more people are getting distracted, and I'm not really into social media. And yeah, like, I would rather not get into social media if it's something that I think is bad. Why would I do stuff on it? Yeah. I don't actually know how many power users are losing valuable insights I know that I do. I know that I have and it's probably like an ADD. It's like the community is Claude ADD people who are technical and who have used LLMs, a lot, maybe are fellow philosophically oriented. Understand things, and are just talking with a lot. I don't know how many people are like that. Minimum feature set that The values provide values maybe something like a workshop where we help them export Their entire chat history and then process it for them sort of Like, you can download your LLM thing like, your whole database of conversations, and then upload it to us our service and We then can review that and process it and Create something useful. But it's like that's the thing. I don't wanna just make something that people see. This is why I wanna make something that people Live how much would people pay? I don't know. It's like, I'm curious. Like, I Maybe it could be something like the book of me. You know? You upload your whole chat GPT, and it gives you a a book you can read, and be just, like, somehow Creatively organizing, structuring, and then maybe using as much of your language rather than generating content as possible. Like ways that you say things literally sentence by sentence, cutting them up and pasting them into new Ways to tell the whole story. Yeah. Kind of reflect on what I just said and some of the ideas and feelings and see if you can come up with an approach leveraging some of our thoughts. Right? Like, is it the scriber method? Should we Google Jekyll and Hyde? Should we get a panel of experts? Should we diverge, or should we converge? Should we, take action and touch the real world. This is a new, element that I think is super important, which is there has to be Claude. Right? Like, there has to be a moment of meaning Otherwise, it's just abstract and arbitrary. And I think that's kind of one of the problem is I just get really excited about stuff and I just do it without really feeling like this is this I would stake my life on doing this or, like, this matter to me so much because I love my baby, and I wanna make a cool thing for him. And it's gonna, like, drive me through from the ideation and the moment, into the action or, like, okay. How do I take this uh-huh and make it me, make it a part of my life? So these things, like some of the principles of truth, love, and beauty. So truth is like seeing, real real like learning, I think a lot of have explored everything that has already been explored so that we're actually saying something new. And then love is care. And iOS that you're working on rather than just arbitrary arbitrarily working on something. Right? And then beauty is the product of these things. They emerge as, like, your actions. What are you gonna gonna do? A beautiful action is born out of love, and love is born out of truly seeing yourself in the world and knowing how to respond And all these things are so philosophical and, like, is there anything in here? Sometimes I wonder if it's just Like, actually, just give talks to people that develop AI. You know?EditLet me use both analytical and creative minds to process this rich reflection, particularly focusing on the emergent themes around meaning, personal connection, and real impact.\nCritical Mind: I notice several key insights from your reflection:\n\nThe \"Book of Me\" concept seems more aligned with your values than a pure tech solution\nYou're questioning the sustainability of community-driven approaches\nThere's a strong emphasis on creating something meaningful vs just technically interesting\nThe target audience might be narrower than we thought (ADD-like, philosophical, heavy LLM users)\n\nLet me create a visualization to map this new understanding:Book of Me Concept MapClick to open diagramCreative Mind: What if we reimagined the \"Book of Me\" as a personal meaning-making journey? Here's a concrete concept:Book of Me Service FlowClick to open componentCritical Mind: This approach addresses several key points from your reflection:\n\nIt's not dependent on ongoing community engagement\nCreates something tangible and meaningful\nUses people's own words and thoughts rather than generating more content\nCould start as a high-touch service before becoming more automated\n\nCreative Mind: And it aligns with your principles:\n\nTruth: It's based on real learning and actual conversations\nLove: It's about helping people see their own growth journey\nBeauty: The output is a meaningful artifact of their development\n\nNext Questions:\n\nWould you be excited to create this for yourself first? Could this be something you'd stake your name on?\nCould we start with a very manual process for 1-3 people, possibly including yourself?\nShould we try processing your own chat history first to see what emerges?\n\nThe key here might be starting with something deeply personal and meaningful to you, rather than trying to solve a market need first. What resonates most with you about this direction? CopyRetryBGYeah. Actually, this is something that is kind of exciting, for me personally. It makes me wonder about, like, this idea of chap and it would be good to know different things about the person too. And instead of at the just giving him the book, maybe, filling in the gaps. Right? Like, having some questions about What would be the most meaningful for them, in terms of layout of the book or ideas that they want to capture or, you know, it probably definitely made some assumptions about different themes. It's just there are no themes, so it has to generate them. So are these the themes? And, like, maybe, valorizing or highlighting certain themes over others could be a good, thing to do before the book is generated And maybe well, it costs money to generate because of all the token usage. But, maybe they could also, Request it to be, produced and printed, and they actually receive it. And it could be like a chapter book, right, where, you get a book at a time. And, you know, as you continue to chat, I don't know if there's any way to get their LLM usage over time and something like that. But it would be good to see and also, you know, I'm getting data hungry now. I'm like, I want all their WhatsApps and all of their emails or Something like that. But I think that's too invasive and The other idea is, like, should it actually be downloadable software? That just can run-in the background on a MacBook and maybe take days I'm just processing it's, quote, unquote, free for me, but it's like a way of making it so that they can, have, privacy. You know? Like, they don't even have to trust that. Like, yeah. We don't look at your words. Just don't send it to us. Upload it. You know? Like, it would be somehow better if it was with them. And, yeah, you know, after this, what do you think about asking me or or making some assumptions and then asking me to clarify or having a panel of diverse people with different you know, like, understandings Work with me to understand why am I doing this. You know? Like, a real part of it is a financial need, you know, I'm trying to figure out my next career steps, and have these feelings. And I really see the potential with this tool Android see the hazard of just The way that it's currently being utilized and taken and seen as, like, just a tool to replace humans rather than 2 make humans more human. And so I want whatever it is that we're doing to also connect us with our deeper humanity, which is about that's why I think printing the book is interesting for me. It's like getting off of the computer. Like, what did we learn? And, like, sitting with it. You know? Maybe it's a journaling book. Maybe it's like, the the book of me is actually a book that is, a journal that you get in the mail instead of answers, questions. And I'm also wondering about some of these ideas about, choose your own adventure books. Right? Like, is there something interesting that we can do with that? Like, I'm also, cofounder of bloom.pm, a social enterprise training organization in Lebanon. And getting people to see and feel and do and act is a way where they're creating sustainable positive change, feeling proud of what they're doing, connecting their meaning, make with their money making iOS something that's really inspiring to me. And so I wonder if there's anything about this choose your own adventure that can kinda lead this into being not just like a chapter book idea, but, like, some kind of I don't know. Chapter book plus Doing book. Right? It's like, go to page 29 if you you know? And then you instead of going to page 29, it would be something like do something or actually, I I don't really know the best way of doing this. So think of a another way of taking this true chapter choose your own adventure book idea and bring it into this, process. And also, I I hope you're noticing, like, I'm not Scarce. With ideas. I could just keep going. And if you talk to me, I will ideate with you forever. And the problem is, I wanna know, like, my values and my needs and I don't know what other things I should be thinking about My resources, Think about maybe a couple of other things that you should Enquire from me To help take me from this, like, ideating going all over the place starting with, like, hey. Let's make parliaments to how about we print books to what if we just ask people one good question and did some facilitation within, you know, corporate settings where people just ask themselves, like, do How should I How can I be more human using AI? Then without using AI. And if we do that, that might be all it takes. Right? Instead of coming up with all these frameworks and trainings and apps and tools and you know, like, I definitely don't wanna just make stuff to make stuff, and I don't wanna make stuff that no one uses, I keep doing. I've done this over and over again. I just made a AI powered values card generator that goes through people's year reflection and asks them to find meaningful moment and it generates a values Claude. And I sent it to all my friends and I think 2 people did it. And and now it's just there, and I spent, like, 3 or 4 full days focusing and ignoring my fan. Not living my values just to make it. I don't wanna do that again. I wanna do it and then be like, oh, It generates, like, a passive income of a couple Android a month, and it's value to some people, and it actually creates something beautiful instead of just create something. You know? And, yeah. Do you think about all this how is it striking you one of our principles or approaches do you think we should bring into the conversation now?EditLet me engage both minds to process this rich reflection, particularly noting how you've surfaced important tensions between creation, meaning, and practical impact.\nCritical Mind: Let's use the SCRIBER framework to organize our thinking here, but with a twist - focusing specifically on your personal values and constraints.Meaning vs Practicality MapClick to open diagramCreative Mind: Looking at your reflection through both the tensions and values, I see an exciting possibility emerging - what if we created a \"Choose Your Own Learning Journey\" service that combines personal reflection with actual action? Let me prototype this concept:Learning Journey Service ConceptClick to open componentTo move this forward productively, I think we need to ask you some specific questions about implementation capacity and priorities:\n\nResources & Capabilities:\n\n\nDo you have experience with print-on-demand services?\nWhat's your comfort level with local-first software development?\nDo you have existing connections in corporate learning/development?\n\n\nPriority Alignment:\n\n\nWhich matters more: getting something out quickly or building something comprehensive?\nWould you prefer to start with individual users or corporate workshops?\nHow much time per week can you realistically dedicate while honoring family commitments?\n\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n\n\nWhat's the minimum monthly revenue that would make this worth pursuing?\nHow would you measure whether this is actually helping people become \"more human\"?\nWhat timeline would you want to see first results?\n\nRather than continuing to ideate, would you be willing to focus on answering these questions? This could help us narrow down to a specific, actionable path that aligns with both your values and practical constraints. CopyRetryBGI have experience with print on demand services. Yeah. They're pretty easy. And I've even worked with APIs that integrate directly with them to send letters to send postcards. I don't know what else Global First Software Development? Yeah. I think I can pull that off. I have some experience writing different type of code. And it could be Mac app Should even just be some kind of you know, wrapped Python script. Something very simple. Open it up, push a button. Yeah. Corporate learning development. Yeah. You know, I've been running these workshops with, social enterprises around the world. I've been wanting to break into corporate learning development, and I have a friend who works at a company as their head of learning. And Amsterdam and I could ask, you know, and try to get some workshops, opened up. I'm definitely done. Lots of online training and workshops and in person training and workshops, and I'm a great facilitator And, but I've never done, like, work on this in part particular. And I guess one of my other criteria is, like, try building stuff that can make money and value without me. Something that they can produce and sell like a like a product or a service that is sellable, you know, rather or it's like a brand even that's sellable, but not I don't wanna be flying all over the world. I have a new baby, and yeah, I would like to have like, I've had this dream of a passive income for ages. Maybe just need to help me shatter this game and realize that I need to be in service and and useful. And, actually, the thing that I have most of the best to offer is myself. Maybe the realization of the fact that all I do is come up with new ideas over and over again is that I should be helping others that know have that skill with my skill. You know? Something like that rather than think like, oh, I'll make a tool so that people that think like me can actually benefit from their thoughts rather than realize that maybe maybe I am fairly unique in my use case and thinking. I have no idea if I am, but it might be. And so why would I impose this style on others just because I think it's cool, for instance. Getting something out quickly or comprehensive. I kinda like the idea of getting something out more quickly. But maybe that's my problem because I've I've done that a lot, and I am not any the better for it. For instance, I made this last project in 3 days and now I'm, like, after, like, very little positive response, I'm, like, maybe. I mean, it wasn't the best idea. Who knows? And I'm just gonna, like, let it go and move on. So Maybe I shouldn't move on. Like, are there a bunch of small sprints like this that I can take that add up to something much bigger? Like, that could be cool where I get validation and feedback every time. Can I I think the reason why I'm giving up is because I gave it to people, and they didn't say wow? They were just like, oh, that's interesting. Okay. You know? And they just kept going. I could I could make time for this. Like, I don't have a job right now. So I need a job, and I need money, and this would be great. I also have Newell Creative Studios, which is a company that sells essential oils and, you know, liquor beads online. And, maybe we have a connection with that somehow because we have 4,000 customers, or more, many, like, repeat customers. We got 30 people shopping with us every month and I don't know. I could share with them, like, hey. Thanks for being a customer. Here's a new product. Or you know, I've worked with thousands of entrepreneurs around the world. Maybe I could know, put it in the next newsletter. I even have access to Daniel Goldman who suggested that if I come up with something interesting, I can put it in his newsletter. So have some ways of reaching people. I guess, you know, for me, it would be great if it Claude, like, just a regular, very consistent $5,000 a month. That'd be awesome. I mean, I I don't wanna short sell myself, but like, that would be really cool. And I also don't even wanna continue to think and dollars. So let's think in some other kind of value because, yeah, Yeah. I don't know how long the dollar will be interesting. Helping become more human I mean, we have to get stories. Right? Like, I think something about more human You know, like, Kareem Lahan, the writer talks about craft and, like, getting their hand literally touching things. Something about the human and the hand and the heart and the relationships, all of these things seem to be in important elements of real humanity rather than just whatever is going to make money, you know? So What what do you think? What are the things that we can measure to find this kind of human touch. Oh, wow. Okay. This sounds some big, old neutrons. Timeline. I mean, it would be great if I had regular small bursts of, like, positive feedback Success wouldn't necessarily have to be something about making money, even if it's just users adoption, even, like, feedback from people, interviews, I making progress on, like, getting clarity or yeah. Money is great too, but not necessarily the, the needed part. Also, I have money to put into it. I have a little bit of money. I'm willing to invest. So if we need to hire people, designer, experts for any particular reason, we can do that.EditLet me analyze this rich response through both lenses to help focus our direction.\nCritical Mind: I notice several key pivots in your thinking that deserve attention:Evolution of Success MetricsClick to open diagramCreative Mind: Let me propose a different kind of service model that combines your strengths with sustainable growth:Hybrid Service ModelClick to open componentThis approach addresses several key points from your reflection:\n\nIt starts with direct facilitation (your strength) but builds toward scalability\nIt includes physical artifacts and human touch\nIt provides regular feedback and validation points\nIt leverages your existing networks and resources\nIt builds sustainable value while allowing for iteration\n\nCritical Next Questions:\n\nWould you be willing to start with facilitated workshops to test these ideas with real people?\nShould we design a small pilot program for your essential oils customers first?\nWhat aspects of this hybrid approach feel most aligned with your values and energy?\n\nThe key insight here is moving from \"build tool first\" to \"facilitate understanding first, then build tools to support that understanding.\" This could provide both the meaningful impact you seek and the sustainable revenue you need, while honoring the human element that seems core to your vision. CopyRetryBGI'm the kind of person that's, like, build tool first, all the time. And then, like, I feel because of that, I think I have some credit I at this thing that I made. You know? But I do that so often that I'm thinking, maybe this time, I might need to something a little bit differently And maybe doing something differently means not listening to myself and having an AI like you think about you know, who I am and you've heard from me so far and my pitfalls and help me avoid doing it to first of all, you know, clarify my values and help me live my values. And achieve a Goals that, you know, some of my values are to be calm, and kind of a crescendo in my work, but, like, I was a person with a EDF, and that really it's difficult to attain that state. And so that's one. And then another one could be like I wanna live In generosity and be able to give and to help my wife feel safe and free to be as she wants rather than to think she must have a job in a certain way and work in a certain way Like, some kind of freedom instead of feeling stuck on the job that she has, so that requires me to be making more money sustainably for the long term. And you know, rather than feeling constrained about Being able to fly to see my family, that also requires some finances. And so all of these different values, I don't know if Joe Edelman would really call them values. Like, you can help me really refine my values and see how I want to live and I don't even know if I wanna think about needs or goals. Right? And that's a little bit of a weird thing to say because I think everyone was like, I achieve my goals. I wanna make money. I wanna But, like, what if we just design a good life and figure out you know, a life of serving beauty and to kind of live the ideals that I'm thinking about sharing through these tools, and that way I get to have even more credibility and Claude saying there's something interesting becoming more human that is, like, not just gonna create garbage marketing media online promising the world to make you rich before before 35 so you can retire and buy an island in New Zealand and escape the global climate collapse. It's not about that. It's it's like, what if we found your vocation you know, your role in the world. And do I need a cofounder? To be able to be in service of beauty? And how does that change how you run, you know, startup programs or innovation sessions at, corporate setting and, you know, I'm I'm trying to see this as a moment to do things differently. And maybe I should be doing them differently. As well, both Claude, like, do I start with a product or do I start with the questions And I think I'd like to come up with our know, frameworks and principles and stances or that we hold in in this as a job, right, as work, And in doing that, we then derive our course of action rather than the other way around. And I'm curious how that lands for you and what you know, one of the, frames for that we had in an early AI conversation framework is about persona. It's like, what personas do you think you'd like to take on as you respond to me. Which different ones and how would you critique my take? And find the productive tension and move forward. Should we design a small pilot? I don't know. Yeah. Go for it.EditThis reflection shows a profound shift from \"what should we build?\" to \"how should we be?\" Let me engage with this through multiple perspectives to help find clarity.Being vs Doing: A Path to Authentic WorkClick to open diagramLet me take on two personas to explore this further:\nThe Contemplative Guide:\nYour desire to \"start with the questions\" rather than jumping to solutions feels deeply important. The shift from \"what should we build?\" to \"how should we be?\" suggests a readiness for a different approach. What if we created a structured exploration process for you first, before thinking about how to help others?Personal Exploration ProcessClick to open componentThe Practical Architect:\nWhile honoring this deeper exploration, we still need to address practical realities. What if we designed small \"experiments in beauty\" that could generate income while staying true to your values? These might be:\n\nFacilitated \"Deep Listening\" Sessions\n\n\nSmall group workshops (3-5 people)\nFocus on personal AI interaction patterns\nPhysical artifacts and reflection tools\nPremium pricing for depth of experience\n\n\nCorporate \"Beauty in Innovation\" Programs\n\n\nHelp teams find meaningful innovation paths\nIntegrate AI tools mindfully\nFocus on human connection and craft\nSustainable recurring revenue\n\n\nIndividual \"Vocation Finding\" Journeys\n\n\nOne-on-one guidance\nCustom reflection tools\nPhysical artifacts and documentation\nHigh-touch, high-value service\n\nCritical Questions for Moving Forward:\n\nWould you be willing to spend 6 weeks in this exploration process before building anything?\nCould we design small experiments that generate income while honoring this deeper approach?\nHow might we document this journey in a way that becomes valuable content for others?\n\nThe key insight here is that your journey of finding a different way forward could itself become the foundation for helping others. Instead of building tools first, you might be uniquely positioned to guide others through this transformation because you're actively living it.

How can you teach your child about following their passion if you keep running from yours?\nHere's what you're going to do:\n\nTake ONE of your corporate training contacts - ONE - and schedule a \"Human-Centered AI Innovation\" workshop. Not after building a tool. Not after creating a framework. NEXT WEEK.\nDOCUMENT the process. Not because you're going to turn it into a product, but because this is how you learn. This is how you stay present.\nNO NEW TOOLS for 90 days. I'm serious. You're going cold turkey. Use a paper notebook. Use existing tools. But your value isn't in building more tools - it's in your presence, your insight, and your facilitation.\n\nAnd for God's sake, STOP trying to turn everything into a passive income stream! Your gift is in the active work of helping people transform. That's not a limitation - it's your superpower!\nDo you want to end up with another abandoned GitHub repository, or do you want to actually help people while supporting your family? Because right now, you're choosing the former out of fear of the latter.\nSits back down, puts glasses back on\nNow, shall we talk about which of your contacts you're going to call first? CopyRetryBG Okay. I'm not sure that I'm scared of actually succeeding, that doesn't really ring true, but maybe I don't know exactly what success means. Maybe I'm just a doubtful person. Maybe I'm doubtful so that there is no accountability. No, like, take a stand for something. So maybe a lack of courage in essence. So that I'm not blamed for anything by anyone essentially, even by God. Probably because of Stuff that happened in my life early on when I was accused of a crime and I had to sort of be blameless, but feel blameful inside. And so kind of pretend that I'm not Claude worthy and feel blamey blaming myself and kind of create this cognitive dissonance and so I'm not sure if that's important here to understand a little bit of my psychological makeup You know, like, I just I'm a doubtful person. Like, I I want to think of all sides of a problem and guess that's a strength, but it's also a weakness. I'm not sure, if it's a weakness. Like, where can it be leveraged and what should I do what should I stop trying to be an entrepreneur? Should I just give up and be like, oh, finally. Someone else will put me to use rather than me having to figure stuff out. And at the same time, I can't get behind other people's projects or ideas because I'm so judgmental. And because I think maybe I don't like myself. I assume everyone else is as bad as I am, and I just don't like the way that they probably think of so, like, I can't find anybody to trust. And so who do I work for? Yeah. So I'm not sure about safer than putting myself out there. Do I have real experience running workshops, helping people grow? I don't know if I have really helped people grow. Yeah. I don't know if I hide behind APIs. I do like coding. I like making stuff. I like the idea of something that goes out and has a life of its own and like, yeah. I don't know why. I just like this idea of having something that works for me. You know? Like, also like fermentation and working with yeast and growing mushrooms and and things like that where it's like a collaboration with nature and there's tending to things, but not like work. And I think it's maybe more relational and sort of feeling that, like, oh, wow. Like, we're, like, setting things up in a way and then there's, like, value that can emerge, something about knowledge and design and making stuff, Like, I'm not drawing a screen print. You know? Yeah. What do you think about that? And Also, I'd love a Great. System prompts that I can use to update my Claude projects, like, What would it the right sort of system prompt be to be more productive and insightful and touch all the places where in our conversation, you recognize that we actually made progress or had a deep insight or an uh-huh, like, can you go through our conversation and find the moments and find the prince principles of the ways that we were interacting that led to that? And then create a system prompt that creates more situations that are related to those moments.EditAdjusts approach, speaking more thoughtfully now\nYour reflection reveals something much deeper than fear of success - it's about living in a state of productive doubt while still being able to take meaningful action. Let me analyze our most insightful moments and create a framework for moving forward.Conversation Insight PatternsClick to open diagramLet me create a system prompt based on our most productive patterns:Enhanced System Prompt for Transformative DialogueClick to open codeBased on this understanding, I notice that your love of coding and making things \"that have a life of their own\" isn't actually at odds with human interaction - it's about creating conditions for growth, just like in fermentation. What if instead of seeing this as a binary choice between building tools and working with people, we saw it as creating conditions for transformation?\nA few concrete suggestions emerge:\n\nStart with a small workshop series (3-4 sessions) about \"AI and Human Growth\" - but document it like you would a fermentation process. What conditions lead to transformation? What patterns emerge?\nUse your tendency toward doubt productively - instead of trying to build perfect tools, create \"thinking environments\" where people can explore their own doubts and growth.\nThink of yourself less as a teacher/expert and more as a tender of conditions - like working with yeast or mushrooms, you're creating environments where growth can happen naturally.\n\nWould you like to explore any of these directions further? I'm particularly interested in how your fermentation analogy might reframe how you think about working with people and technology. CopyRetryBGi don't see the system prompt, can you come up with a framework or update SCRIBER based on the AHAs, I'd like it if you found all the AHAs and found the conversational llm framework that could be associated and connect that with a system prompt and share it, first share the prior one i can't see it in the link you shared and then rework it. Let's think also more about fermentation and mushroom growing and working WITH nature instead of against it. and i don't think i always use doubt productively i think i second guess myself, have low self esteem and don't capitalize on opportunities often because of my doubt, i just move onEditLet me first reshare and then expand upon the system prompt, particularly incorporating the natural systems thinking and addressing both productive and unproductive doubt.Conversation Analysis and Framework EvolutionClick to open codeThe key shift here is moving from SCRIBER's more analytical approach to NURTURE's focus on working with natural tendencies. This aligns with your interest in fermentation and natural processes, where success comes from creating the right conditions rather than forcing outcomes.\nWhat particularly strikes me is how this might help address the unproductive doubt pattern. Instead of trying to eliminate doubt (which would be working against a natural tendency), we could create conditions where doubt becomes more productive - like how controlled conditions in fermentation guide the process without forcing it.\nWould you like to explore:\n\nHow this framework might apply to a specific project or idea?\nWays to identify when doubt is being productive vs unproductive?\nHow to create \"containment\" for your ideation process, similar to how fermentation needs the right container?\n\nThe goal is to work with your natural tendencies (ideation, pattern-recognition, desire for emergence) while providing enough structure to prevent unproductive doubt from causing abandonment of promising directions. CopyRetryBGwhat was the first system prompt? Also what questions should I be asking to move the conversation forward and never would, and why not? what principle do we take now to go forward?EditLet me analyze both questions while also noting that I don't see the first system prompt in our conversation - I had tried to create it but there was an error in the function call.\nCritical Mind: Looking at our conversation patterns, here are questions you might not ask but should:\n\n\"What's the smallest meaningful step I could take that would still feel true to my values?\"\nYou might not ask this because it pushes against your tendency to think big and comprehensively.\n\"Who has already solved part of this problem that I could learn from directly?\"\nYou might avoid this due to your mentioned difficulty trusting others' approaches.\n\"What if I documented my doubt process instead of trying to overcome it?\"\nThis reframes doubt as data rather than obstacle.\nMoving Forward: Principles and ActionsClick to open diagramThe key principle moving forward seems to be \"Work with natural tendencies while creating supportive containers.\" This integrates your interest in natural processes (fermentation, mushroom growing) with the need for structure that doesn't constrain.\nThree specific approaches emerge:\n\n\"Container Design\"\n\n\nInstead of building tools, design containers for growth\nLike fermentation vessels, they provide structure without control\nCould start with documentation containers for your own process\n\n\n\"Energy Mapping\"\n\n\nTrack where your energy naturally flows\nNotice what gets abandoned vs what persists\nUse this data to design better containers\n\n\n\"Emergence Support\"\n\n\nFocus on creating conditions rather than forcing outcomes\nDocument what emerges rather than planning what should emerge\nBuild on natural momentum rather than fighting it\n\nThe most immediate action might be starting a documentation practice that feels like \"tending\" rather than \"working\" - perhaps a daily log of where your energy naturally flows and what emerges from that.\nWould you like to explore any of these directions? I'm particularly interested in how we might design a first \"container\" that works with your natural tendencies rather than against them. CopyRetryBGsure, let's use the frameworks and principles we want to train and share to move forward, you can think and make a strategy and doubt yourself and update the strategy before asking me 3 questionsEditLet me model using the NURTURE framework we developed, particularly focusing on the observation and emergence aspects before suggesting action.\nInitial Thoughts:\nNotices natural patterns: You've consistently shown interest in emergent systems, documentation, and meaningful growth.\nQuestions initial impulse: But wait - am I jumping to solutions too quickly? Let me reflect on what conditions need to be present first.\nObserves deeper pattern: The most engaging moments in our conversation happened when we discovered unexpected connections (like fermentation as a metaphor) rather than when we planned specific actions.\nAdjusts approach: Perhaps instead of creating a strategy, we should create conditions for discovery.\nDoubts and refines: Am I being too abstract here? No - the natural systems metaphor suggests starting with observation before action.\nBased on this reflection, here are three questions that emerge:\n\nIf we thought of your next project as a garden or fermentation process, what conditions are already present that could support natural growth?\nWhat's the smallest \"container\" we could create that would help you document your natural way of working without trying to change it?\nWhere do you notice your energy flowing most easily right now - not where you think it should flow, but where it actually does?\n\nThese questions aim to help us observe what's naturally present before designing any interventions. Does one of them particularly resonate with you? CopyRetryBGi have space because no job, i have wifi, a month with nothing happening outside in the world in terms of work or expectation, i have a computer, i have my online courses i take that give me schedule events that i rush to work for, i signed up for a book writing class that has bi weekly writing sprints where we get together to encourage eachother, i have some aderall for that month, i have so many projects a hand span away from being sharable, i'm sure i'm missing stuff, what domains or areas am i not thinking to look in for conditions\n1. i have an assistant and isend her voice notes, i love talks, it always forces me to get my thoughts together for a deadline, my natural way of working is answering questions and maybe going into rabit holes of research \n2. energy flows best when it's quiet i'm alone and i can write poems i love doing that especialyl because it lights people up when they recieve teh cute stationary with the poem and they keep them and it makes me happy, i find energy flowing in chatGPT/claude conversations when i feel like we're getting somewhere (although can be frustrated from lack of outputs or actual progress, just the feeling of progress) - it actually flows when i get over the hump and call my friend or dad and talk about something real, there's always the rush of connection and excitement at finally getting over the dread of having to talk about money with my dad which i need to btw and the release after. the energy to forage, i go all the time, i love finding mushrooms identifying them spending time making spore prints, finding apples, processing them, making vinegar, i love all that, i find energy flowing when i'm on stage or on the spotlight of a presentation, i find energy flowing when i find someone i can talk to about deep things with, or when i'm with my sheikh and can feel the love, i also find energy flowing when the code finalyl works and it is launched and i learned something new about how to run a supabase/vercel nextjs project except then no one using it turns me off and i dont' want to put things on social media i find great energy when i get on calls with people, i don't like scheduling the call, i love interviewing people, i don't like sharing the interview results and making the \"podcast\"EditLet me use our NURTURE framework to analyze these conditions and energy patterns before asking further questions.Conditions and Energy Flow AnalysisClick to open diagramObserves Patterns: I notice strong energy around real-time interaction and natural processes, with resistance to post-processing and distribution.\nQuestions Assumption: Instead of trying to override these patterns, what if we designed around them?\nRefines Understanding: The strongest flows seem to be around:\n\nLive interaction/teaching\nNatural processes/observation\nPersonal expression through poetry\nDeep, meaningful conversations\n\nNotices Missing Domains:\n\nPhysical space configuration\nDaily rhythms/routines\nCommunity connections\nFinancial conditions\n\nBased on this analysis, here are three questions to move forward:\n\nWhat if we designed a \"live-first\" approach where your natural teaching/interviewing energy drives content creation, with minimal post-processing? (Like fermentation - set up conditions and let it work)\nCould we create a \"foraging journal\" that combines your love of natural observation with your project documentation needs? (Working with your pattern of detailed natural observation)\nGiven your energy for deep conversations and answering questions, what if you set up regular \"office hours\" where people could engage with your projects in real-time, eliminating the scheduling friction?\n\nThese questions aim to work with your natural energy flows while creating gentle containers for sustained growth. Which direction feels most alive to you? CopyRetryBGcan we stop with all the back and forth i think perhaps by now you have a clearer picture of what i might need to do that i don't want to do that i really need to do and would be glad to have done, can you ask 5 questions to direct me towards that, i'm feeling lost in this rabbit hole of ideasEditYou're right - let's cut through to what matters. Based on everything you've shared, here are five direct questions:\n\nWhen will you call your dad about money?\nOut of all your nearly-finished projects, which one would take the least energy to actually share with the world?\nYou have an assistant who can handle voice notes - what's stopping you from doing a 30-minute brain dump about your most promising project right now?\nThe writing class you signed up for has built-in accountability and structure - what exactly will you commit to writing during those sprints?\nYou clearly light up when teaching/facilitating - who are three specific people in your network you could contact about running a workshop?\n\nThese aren't philosophical questions - they're about taking concrete actions that align with both your natural tendencies and your need for sustainable income. Which one feels most uncomfortable but necessary to answer? CopyRetryBGnot sure, i called and i just can't bring up the discussion it's scary and crypto is bouncing up  and down(more down)i have these watercolor boxes that i'd love to share by putting on the nur shop, they need some photos, although i sorta wanted to launch them as a kickstarter or as a part of a kickstarter prise and i onl yhave twenty and im' not sure if i can ever get them again, india is far, and the folk i was working with took solongi do, i do regularly, and now i have a giant backlog to prioritizeI want to write about barakanomics yet i also want to write about my personal narative about how i got to it, and i want to talk about the ontology that leads to a different way to think rather than the ways of thinking, so i get to talking about philosophy and it's been hard to settle on a book idea and structure, want to see my book proposal so far?i could ask Pascal, I just did one with Nihal maybe i can ask again, Nihal, maybe I can do something with Murt and his business, and maybe i can ask my wife to ask at her work? Or I can ask Sam, and then there's Tudor - although he called me and i didn't pick up and i feel bad to return asking for a favorEditLet me focus on the most pressing patterns here:\n\nThere's a clear pattern of avoidance with financial conversations (both with your dad and potential business opportunities) - this needs addressing given your need for sustainable income.\nYou have many relationships and opportunities but hesitate to leverage them (Tudor, workshop contacts) - often due to self-imposed barriers (\"feel bad to return asking for favor\").\nYou're stuck between perfect and good enough (watercolor boxes, book structure).\n\nHere are the three most important next actions, in order:\n\nSchedule a specific time to call your dad about money. Not \"soon\" - an actual date and time. When will that be?\nSend a voice note to your assistant with instructions to reach out to Tudor with a simple \"Sorry I missed your call, would love to catch up. Are you free [specific time] this week?\"\nPick ONE approach for your book (personal narrative OR ontology) - not both. Which one feels more urgent to write right now?\n\nThe underlying principle here isn't about more ideation or possibilities - it's about choosing and acting. When would you like to commit to doing the first one? CopyRetryBGi can just call him sometime today and see how it goes based on what you know about me how can i over come the fear, he gave me money to invest and it's up and down and i just want to throw it back and say take it i don't want it yukyukity yukI could do that, although shouldn't it come from me? Maybe i can come up with the workshop plan a little first before calling?i want a more practical book although everytime i sit to write I find energy in philosophy, although i don't think anyone will be impacted and the world wont care about my book. so i want a practical guide to making your business beautiful so the world is more beautiful in aggregate and instead i write about how seeing the reality of oneness will lead us to realize the trees are us and we are the trees and how sacred it is to utilize some of nature, it's not a natural resource, and that people aren't human \"resources\" how crude to use such a sacred thing for a means to an end (profit) rather than an end in and of itself. these ideas flow, except sort of like islam iman ihsan where ihsan is how you see the oneness and god becomes the hand with which oyu strike and the eye with which you see, and islam is the physical movements, saying, doing, etc. they both lead up and down and they're all required so maybe it's ok to dumb th ebook down and make it practical, or write a followup, or addendum, or who knows i don't knowEditLet me address these directly:\n\nFor the call with your dad - here's a simple script:\n\"Dad, I need to talk about the investment money. I've been avoiding this conversation because I feel terrible about the volatility, but that's exactly why we need to talk. Would you prefer to take the money back now? I'd rather have a clear conscience than continue feeling this weight.\"\n\nThe fear comes from imagining the worst, but your dad probably just wants transparency. The longer you wait, the harder it gets. The relief after will be worth it.\n\nYes, it should come from you - and no, you don't need a complete workshop plan. That's your perfectionism creating another delay. A simple message:\n\"Hi Tudor, sorry I missed your call. I've been developing some workshops on [topic] and would love to get your thoughts. Free for a quick call this week?\"\nYou're hitting on something profound here about the relationship between practical action and deeper understanding. But here's the thing - you don't have to choose. Consider this structure:\n\n\nStart with practical guidance (the \"what\" and \"how\")\nEach chapter ends with a deeper dive into the philosophy behind it (the \"why\")\nReaders can engage at whatever level resonates with them\n\nThe most pressing action right now is calling your dad. Would you like to do it right now while this conversation is fresh? You could even type out what you want to say first if that helps. CopyRetryBGno i'd rather sleep and hide, go back through our context in your project and find all the approaches and identify from oru conversation what worked best (i like to mic drop, write the app and drop it online in a whatsapp group telling myself i shared it without asking what people thought or following up, writing a chat like this and feeling good then leaving all the actions i found to do undone) and instead i just wanna go have sex and sleep and hide, it's new years, i'm not readyEditI hear you about wanting to hide - that's a very human response. Let me reflect back what I've observed about patterns that actually work for you vs ones that don't:\nWhat Works:\n\nClear deadlines/external accountability (like your writing group)\nBeing in conversation/dialogue (like this chat)\nSmall, meaningful actions (like writing poems on nice stationery)\nReal human connection (deep conversations, teaching moments)\n\nWhat Doesn't Work:\n\n\"Mic drops\" - sharing without follow-through\nBuilding without user validation\nTrying to be perfect before starting\nAvoiding difficult conversations through distraction\n\nHere's what I notice: Your strongest moments come through real connection, but your avoidance patterns push you toward isolated actions that don't require vulnerability.\nThe dad conversation feels big because it requires both vulnerability and accountability. It's okay to rest today - it's New Year's. But would you be willing to set a specific time tomorrow to:\n\nWrite out what you want to say (using your natural skill with words)\nShare the script here for feedback (using your comfort with dialogue)\nMake the call (turning avoidance into action)\n\nSometimes hiding is part of the process - but let's put a time limit on it. When tomorrow would you be ready to take this step? CopyRetryBGdon't want to write it out, how can i build courage based on where i am and where i need to go, it seems like courage (and maybe we can use a values card process to help me identify what i'm really seeking besides the tag courage, what do i notice how does it make me feel what are the ways of being) and how can i increase that in my life, is courage just a trait, is it related to wanting to be small so i can' tbe judged because i was accused of a crime when i was younger and built this shame of being seen / known / accused for being bad and wrong, and somehow i believe i am so i mic drop because iw ant connection yet run when it comes. how can i take my tendencies, i often when i'm on aderal will send 100s of whatsapps responding, then get overwhelmed when they respond and then ignore them for 6 months - i tried to overcome this by asking for help with other facilitator friends pascal and nihal and mujtaba - i told them instead of me holding the space of this group i want us to do it togeher because i can't always be on top of thigns and i drop the ball, why do i drop the ball on things i car eabout why do i keep starting new things - not letting things deepen, why do i want connection and vulnerability yet i can't do the scary thing? why is it even scary?EditLet me use the values card approach to dig deeper into this pattern around courage and connection.Values and Attention Patterns AnalysisClick to open codeBased on this analysis, let me ask you about specific moments:\n\nWhen you're teaching or facilitating, do you feel this same fear of judgment? If not, what makes those moments different?\nThink of a time you followed through completely on something (not a mic-drop). What made that feel safe enough to sustain?\nWhen you send those hundreds of WhatsApp messages on Adderall, what are you feeling in that moment that makes it possible to reach out?\n\nThe goal isn't to \"build courage\" - it's to understand how to create conditions where being seen feels safe enough to sustain connection. Can you tell me more about any of these moments?\nThis isn't about fixing something broken - it's about understanding your natural patterns so we can work with them rather than against them. Your tendency to give/teach isn't wrong, we just need to find ways to make receiving and accountability feel as safe as giving does. CopyRetryBGwhy not also grow, i know i need more courage, i feel weak in the face of palestine and speaking up because i don't want to hurt people and don't want to reduce my opportunities, \n1. i get into a flow, if eel like I'm raelly connecting i can see people understand i can get realtime feedback about the value i am or am not bringing, i can tell that it's fun and insightful and people share and i weave a web across ideas i can hold everyone who shares and connect the dots with what i am sharing and what others have said all highly engaged and i feel like i do real contribution there\n2. followed through by moving with my wife to france and just being here. or just by gritting my teeth and ignoring the gnawing \"this isn't right\" feeling. just saying there's a deeper wisdom, be patient, meditatinga lot and slowly over years working to make my relationship first tolerable and then enjyoable not sure what else. oh finding a cofounder who's up and atem, so i just have to show up and tag along and add my critical annoying voice to be sure to steer from the back, haha\n3. i guess i feel awake, loving, desiring of connection, happy energetic, ambitious, ready etcEditLet me address both the growth question and analyze these revealing moments.Courage and Growth PatternsClick to open diagramYour responses reveal something crucial: Courage isn't missing - it's contextual. Look at where it naturally emerges:\n\nIn facilitation: When you have real-time feedback and clear value creation\nIn relationships: When you commit to patient, long-term growth\nIn energized states: When you feel fully awake and connected\n\nThe growth opportunity isn't about \"getting more courage\" - it's about extending these natural courage patterns to new contexts. For instance:\n\nSpeaking up about Palestine could draw on your facilitation courage:\n\n\nCreating dialogue spaces rather than just statements\nConnecting dots between perspectives\nReal-time engagement with feedback\n\n\nFollowing through could use your relationship patience:\n\n\nViewing project completion as a long-term relationship\nFinding co-creators who complement your energy\nAccepting that \"this isn't right\" feeling as part of the process\n\n\nBuilding sustainable connections could leverage your energized state:\n\n\nCreating structures that support consistent engagement\nFinding ways to maintain connection without requiring constant high energy\nDeveloping \"low tide\" patterns to complement your \"high tide\" moments\n\nQuestion: What if we looked at the dad conversation through the lens of your facilitation strength? Instead of seeing it as a confrontation, could it be a chance to \"weave a web\" of understanding around the investment situation? You're actually quite skilled at holding complex conversations when you're in facilitator mode.\nWould you be interested in exploring how to apply your natural courage patterns to these growth areas? We could start with whichever feels most alive right now. CopyRetryBGmaybe something about \"who i want to be\" and also the deepening knowledge that i'll gain in energy with this out of the way i liked this values card\nVALUES CARD EXPLORATION\nWhat you pay attention to in moments requiring \"courage\":\n- Potential for judgment\n- Fear of being seen as \"bad\"\n- Desire for connection\n- Impulse to withdraw\n- Past experiences of shame\n- Need to protect yourself\nWhat you pay attention to in moments of flow:\n- Teaching others\n- Making discoveries\n- Deep conversations\n- Creating beauty (poems, art)\n- Natural processes\n- Immediate feedback\nUnderlying Pattern:\nYou're not actually seeking \"courage\" - you're seeking SAFETY TO BE SEEN.\nWhen you're in teaching/creative mode:\n- You feel safe being seen because you're offering value\n- The connection is structured around giving\n- Your vulnerability has a clear purpose\nWhen you're avoiding:\n- Connection requires receiving or accountability\n- Being seen means possible judgment\n- Vulnerability feels purposeless or dangerous\nThis isn't about lacking courage - it's about a deep pattern of protecting yourself from judgment by either:\n1. Giving/teaching (safe visibility)\n2. Withdrawing completely (safe invisibility)\nWhat you're actually attending to:\nSAFE WAYS TO BE SEEN AND KNOWN\nThis manifests as attention to:\n- Opportunities to give value\n- Ways to control visibility\n- Structured ways to connect\n- Clear roles and purposes\n- Protected vulnerability\nThe mic-drops, starting new things, and overwhelming responsiveness followed by withdrawal are all ways of controlling how and when you're seen - giving you the connection you crave while maintaining the ability to withdraw when it feels unsafe.especially the seen and not seen part, ask me more questions to expand on this and help me identify ways to get to the values state to be seen and known - maybe i don't need aderal if i'm in a different sort of flow rather than fighting allt hese emotional weights of things i //should// do and can't vs things i'm excited to do because it's the right thing, i don't need aderal for foraging, and writing, i'm not on it today, and this conversation is going great, i don't need it for the workshops, maybe for the time befroe, and on stage im' fineEditThis is a crucial insight about flow states versus forced states. Let me explore this deeper with you through some specific questions:\n\nYou mentioned not needing Adderall for foraging, writing, and this conversation. In these moments:\n\n\nWhat gives you permission to be fully seen?\nWhat makes these activities feel inherently \"right\" rather than things you \"should\" do?\nHow is vulnerability different in these contexts?\n\n\nAbout the \"right thing\" versus \"should\":\n\n\nWhen you feel something is the \"right thing\", what physical sensations accompany that?\nHow does your breathing change?\nWhere in your body do you feel the difference between excitement and obligation?\n\n\nRegarding being seen and known:\n\n\nWho do you feel most authentically seen by?\nWhat qualities in them or the situation make that possible?\nWhat's different about their way of seeing you compared to how you imagine others see you?\n\nThe pattern suggests you don't actually need external stimulation when you're aligned with your natural way of being - you only need it to override resistance. What if we focused on finding more alignment rather than more ways to override?\nI'm particularly struck by your observation about workshops - that you only need support \"for the time before.\" What happens in that preparation time that feels different from the actual workshop flow? CopyRetryBGno one around, being alone with a computer or in nature, having the time, loving the curiosity, feeling like progress, finding food feeling like i can feed people combined with appreciation of nature, suprise of the hunt and the joy of the find, gratitude to the amazing fact that it grows \"Free\" amazing, what vulnerability, i'm alone it's great\nfeeling ease, nothig because i'm in flow, watching my fingres dance on the keyboard being out for a walk, right not wondering what others are thinking about me like i always do when people are around, for instance josephine is in the kitchen, my wife, and i'm worried she wants me for something and is wondering why i'm not doing something right now so this writing isn't as deep or thoughtful as i'd like. Breathing full and relaxed, tension gone because i'm alone it's great. excitement is in my heart obligation is in my head and stomach\n1. i guess seen when i feel understood for some of my crazier ideas or if people take them and run, like in jam sessions when i'm teling a story, or when a previous partner who's an artist takes me ideas and prints them onto fabric bags and makes them have meaning thahir outside batin inside are printed on the cloth bags, so cool \ncreative people with depth and insight, love, care, proactive doing, i'm not sure, maybe they love me i guess :) they see a mirror? creativity? something playful, joyful and free, etcEditThis is revelatory - the contrast between your energy when alone/in flow versus when feeling observed is striking. Let me explore a pattern I'm seeing:UntitledClick to open codeThis raises three crucial questions:\n\nGiven that you're most authentic alone, what if the dad conversation started as a written exploration - just you and your thoughts - before becoming a call? Not a script, but a genuine processing of what you want to express?\nYou mentioned creative people seeing \"a mirror\" - what if your hesitation with follow-through isn't about fear but about preserving the purity of creation? How might we honor both the solitary creative process and the need for connection?\nLooking at when you feel \"seen\" - it's often when others take your ideas and run with them. What if we reframed sharing not as performance but as offering seeds for others' creativity?\n\nThe pattern suggests you might need a different approach to visibility - not more courage to be seen, but better containers that honor your natural creative process. Would you like to explore any of these directions? CopyRetryBGmaybe that's why i make the apps and put them in the world and feel so dispaointed, i feel like disapointment is a clue to when connection was close then falls through, \n1. yeah i could write it i already had a chat with GPT about it\n2. not so sure about that i love improvisation and jamming and i LOVE seeing people light up and give their juice so the thing that's made is better than anything i could have ever done we are ins ervice to beauty\n3. i like that idea of seeds for others creativity, that's why i make projects that support other people's entrepreneurial journey and why this whole chat started off about coming up with a journal that helps people see feel and do authentically \nnot sure i create alone best and then share, i do want to write a book ,yet it's about getting authority and having something where i felt like i put enough work that it's ok to be proud of, that now it's ok to be rich and famous, i did the hard thingEditThis gives us a much clearer picture of the relationship between creation, connection, and validation. Let me focus on three revealing patterns:\n\nThe disappointment with apps might come from expecting a type of connection that the medium can't provide - you thrive on real-time \"jamming\" and co-creation, not passive deployment.\nThe book desire seems to be about earning the right to be seen (\"ok to be proud of\", \"ok to be rich and famous\") - but your most alive moments come when you're focused on mutual creation rather than proving worth.\nYour energy is highest when facilitating others' growth and creativity - but you might be trying to package that energy into more static forms (apps, books) instead of leaning into its naturally dynamic nature.\n\nHere's a direct question that might help cut through: What if you already have permission to be seen, to be successful, to have impact? What would you do differently if you didn't need to earn it through a book or project?\nBecause right now, it sounds like you're trying to earn something you naturally give others in your facilitation and creative collaborations - the permission to be fully seen and valued. CopyRetryBGgive more public talks? get into companies and help them transform? start a venture studio, raise money? \nhow would you recommend i move from apps? or can apps and deployment ahve a more jammy sort of approach. i already wrote some tools that let people use the ipad to draw and chat with chat gpt with handwriting and my friend muj was excited to contribute yet he never did. everyone's so busy and overwhelmed and has no time unless it's their job i don't know how to do that. should i raise money and hire a team just to get that flow jammy state ?EditLet me focus on your question about how deployment and development could be more \"jammy\" while being realistic about people's availability and engagement.From Solo Apps to Collaborative CreationClick to open diagramHere's what stands out:\n\nInstead of raising money immediately, what if you started with:\n\n\nWeekly public \"build sessions\" where you code live and people can drop in\nRegular show & tells of progress (like your writing group but for development)\nClear ways for others to contribute asynchronously between sessions\n\n\nFor corporate transformation work:\n\n\nStart with a single workshop for one company\nDocument the process openly\nLet the results speak for themselves before scaling\n\n\nFor the jammy approach to apps:\n\n\nBuild in public (live streams, open development)\nCreate clear \"contribution hooks\" where others can add value in small, defined ways\nFocus on tools that enhance real-time collaboration rather than solo use\n\nThe key is to maintain your natural improvisational energy while creating sustainable structures around it. Instead of trying to make everyone match your energy level (which hasn't worked), create containers where different energy levels can coexist productively.\nWould you like to experiment with any of these approaches? We could design a simple test case that wouldn't require major commitment from others but could demonstrate the potential.\nThe goal isn't to completely change your style but to create conditions where your natural way of working can thrive while still producing lasting value. CopyRetryBGdon't want to and why would people come it's annoying, maybe in person? live coding is boring i'm bad at coding good at ideas, i can only code with GPT help\ndocument openly means what for the workshop? i can feel my tone get annoyed, i think we need a different divergent track like ze frank or something. i dunnoEditI notice your energy dropping significantly and frustration rising. You're right - live coding doesn't align with your strengths, and \"document openly\" is the kind of vague suggestion that sounds good but doesn't mean much in practice.\nLet me take a completely different approach:\nWhen you mentioned Ze Frank, your energy shifted. He was brilliant at creating participatory art/experiences that brought people together in unexpected ways. What drew you to reference him?\nI'm curious if there's something in his approach - playful, human, sometimes absurd but always genuine - that feels more aligned with how you'd actually want to work?\n(And I notice you getting annoyed with my suggestions - that's valuable feedback. Instead of me continuing to propose things, could you tell me more about what makes the Ze Frank reference feel different?) CopyRetryBGi think i just need to do something different and you can't do that for me, because maybe it needs to be real, water color, in person call my dad soemthing off the type text place reflect review and create a comprehensive handoff document documenting our conversation so far, what was unique valuable intersting we want to take into the future, what format should it take so we can boot up without losing ahas and without losing context you can ask as man questions as you need to derive your insights. also i wanna be suprised, be creative think deeply and offer something i couldn't ask for and would love to seeEditLet me reflect back first: I hear you saying you need to step away from the digital/theoretical and into something tangible and real. And you're also asking for two specific things:\n\nA synthesis of our conversation's insights\nSomething surprising that comes from deep engagement with our discussion\nUntitledClick to open codeAnd now for something unexpected - a different way of seeing these patterns:The Mycelial Nature of Your WorkClick to open diagramThe surprising insight: You operate like a mycelial network. Your strength isn't in the individual \"fruiting bodies\" (apps, documents, outputs) but in the vast underground network of connections and transformations you facilitate.\nJust as mushrooms emerge when conditions are right, your visible projects should be allowed to surface naturally rather than being forced. The real work happens in the invisible network - teaching, connecting, transforming ideas.\nThe key isn't to change how you operate, but to honor this mycological nature: nurturing the underground network, allowing natural emergence, and trusting the timing of fruition.\nWould you like to explore either the practical synthesis or this metaphorical reframing further? I'm particularly curious about how this mycelial perspective might change how you think about your next moves. CopyRetryBGyeah, ask me 5 aditional questions to get a bunch of takeaways to get to a new chat as the context window is quite long and i don't want to miss stuff also, i dont' want a random document, iwant the document filled with my insights so it's true to me coming from me you can ask questions to get me to say the stuff and help me orgnize i like th emushroom idea although waiting underground for the chance to bloom isn't great, i'm in a wanting to bloom mode, should i do something off the computer or email or call?EditLet me ask you five questions to surface your insights before focusing on immediate action:\n\nLooking at this mushroom metaphor - where do you feel most nourished and alive in your \"underground network\" right now? Which connections and activities are feeding you?\nYou mentioned being in \"wanting to bloom mode\" - what does blooming look like for you right now? Not what you think it should look like, but what your energy is actually pulling toward?\nWhen you think about moving \"off the computer\" - what specific activities make your body feel energized rather than contracted? Where does your breath naturally deepen?\nIn our conversation, we touched on times you feel safe being seen vs times you withdraw. Can you tell me about the most recent time you felt completely safe being seen? What made that possible?\nYou've mentioned the dad conversation several times - what's the smallest possible real action that would move this energy rather than letting it stay stuck? Not the whole conversation, just a tiny shift?\n\nThese questions aim to help you write your own next chapter rather than receiving it from me. Which one feels most alive to answer first? CopyRetryBGi feel like there's a congealing idea about th eimportance of the present moment, the togetherness that comes when people meet in person in realtime (or maybe just realtime), something about choices needing qualitative information taht's present only inside and only in the now, and how these ideas relate to taoism and tawhid in islam and how they result in a different way of being in the world, and thinking of the world that will lead to a more beautiful way of acting in the world and this idea is getting stronger and more stable and clear for meblooming like doing, baby is a sleep and there's not much time before he wakes and we need to go to melissas house and it's the end of the day. help me see what we practically did today, if anything at all, and if not, help me understand why i need this validationt hat i did something, and help me do something maybe already?!i already worked out, maybe calling my dad and talking about money? too scary not much time, yeeeeesh ok what?i talked for a while with my friend on the call and he kept reassuring me tha the loves hearing me talki can call now?EditI notice a clear shift in energy in your last response - from philosophical reflection to a very present \"now\" moment with real constraints (baby sleeping, end of day, time pressure).\nRather than exploring more questions, let me mirror back what I hear you ready for:\nYou have a window of time right now. Your energy has built through our conversation. You mentioned calling your dad twice in your response. There's something powerful about the idea of moving from reflection to action, especially given our discussion about being present in the \"now.\"\nWould you like to make the call now? Not the whole money conversation necessarily, but just opening the channel of connection? You could even say \"Hey Dad, I've been thinking about the investment situation and would love to set up a time to talk about it properly.\"\nSometimes the smallest real action can shift more energy than hours of perfect planning. What do you feel in your body reading this suggestion? CopyRetryBGa meh sensation, i was hoping for an insight into my psychology or an encouragement given what you know about me that would make me feel confident, maybe some sufi inspired stuff or who knows, high hopes, haha, another let down, maybe it's true you can't have a real relationship with a computer i guess?EditAh - this response reveals something important about our entire conversation about courage, visibility, and action. You're seeking transformation through insight (wanting \"sufi inspired stuff\" or psychological understanding) when what you might actually need is simpler but harder: taking action while still feeling \"meh.\"\nYour disappointment that I can't provide the perfect insight to make you feel confident is telling. It mirrors the pattern we discussed earlier: seeking perfect conditions/understanding before acting.\nConsider this: The \"meh\" sensation might be exactly right. Not because I'm a computer (though that's true), but because no amount of insight - from human or AI - can eliminate the \"meh\" of difficult conversations. Even Sufis had to make uncomfortable calls (well, the modern equivalent).\nThe interesting question isn't \"how do I feel confident enough?\" but \"can I act with integrity even while feeling meh?\"\nWould you like to explore this distinction further? There's something profound here about the relationship between feeling and action that seems central to your journey. CopyRetryBGi called my dad and he gave the phone to my mom and it was kind of cool, i felt connected with my mom, we promised to read quran with each other, and i sent my dad a screenshot of the market and the current price and told him shall we call? as a text, so let's see, that was helpful, it's late now, what can i do at 945pm to prepare myself for tomorrow?EditThat's fantastic! Notice how the actual action was different (and probably better) than what we were building up in our heads - you got a meaningful moment with your mom and made a gentle opening with your dad about the investment.\nLet's use this positive momentum and energy shift to think about tomorrow. Given what we learned about your natural patterns:\n\nWhen do you feel most energized and clear tomorrow? Morning? After exercise?\nWhat's one small thing you could set up now that would help you start tomorrow in a state of \"flow\" rather than \"should\"? (Maybe laying out your workout clothes, or writing down your most important intention?)\nGiven this experience of taking a small action bearing unexpected fruit, what similar small step could you plan for another area you've been avoiding?\n\nThe key seems to be finding these smaller, more organic entry points rather than forcing big confrontational moments. How would you like to set yourself up for tomorrow? CopyRetryBGi feel best when i wake up early do some exercise and read quran and pray and pray long and deep enough (it always takes more time than i think and i've had a hard time getting to a point of deep feeling and contemplation recently) and then with all my mushroom powders, coffee, tea, and maybe aderal, it's friday so i wanna feel up and good. maybe most important intention? sometimes i get frazzled, i wake up early, except i then take an hour to make my coffee and mushroom powder drinks and sometimes get distracted by my phone, how can i make the morning time feel expansive? rather than cramming all the best practices into it before the baby wakes up? i'm not sure what should my next action be, you can review? i have lots of people to respond to on whatsapp and i sorta wanted to send a hapyp new years thing and i definitly want to apply for that job in gaza and potentially fire my assistant and hire a new one or find a solution for her bad grammar and what i'm noticing as a lack of growth and ability to hold me accountable and be creative and needs a lot of direction and hand holding, i'm looking ot hire a \"mom\" not someone who needs to be assisted to help her assist me, i hired her to find my patterns and help me get over my add symptoms, to help with prioritization, find me jobs to apply to etcEditA few key patterns emerge from this response that we should address first:\n\nYou're seeking expansiveness in your morning but cramming it with practices and substances\nYou have multiple \"should\" tasks hanging over you (WhatsApp, job application, assistant situation)\nYou want deep spiritual connection but feel rushed to achieve it\n\nLet me ask you three focused questions:\n\nWhat if tomorrow morning, instead of trying to fit everything in, you just did ONE thing with full presence? What would give you the most genuine sense of expansiveness - not what you think you should do, but what your heart needs?\nAbout the assistant situation - you mentioned wanting a \"mom\" figure to help with accountability. Given our earlier discussion about being seen and safety, what qualities would make you feel both supported AND accountable? (This might help clarify whether to adjust the current relationship or seek someone new.)\nLooking at your list (WhatsApp messages, job application, assistant situation), which one of these, if addressed, would create the most spaciousness in your mind? Not the most urgent, but the one that's taking up the most mental energy?\n\nLet's identify ONE clear next step that aligns with your natural energy rather than adding to the sense of cramming things in. CopyRetryBGi sorta want to do all those things to get myself into the state where the nice mindset and feeling of having a full day already and everything else is extra is there. maybe that's not the best way to think about it though, i remember a lot of morning routines have many things journaling, working out, coffee, reading, meditation, etc - how is that not cramming? maybe i need to think about the full day though?i don't know - maybe you can help me think through if i should augment my assistant with a bunch of prompts (use these prompts before talking to me, haha) or if i should replace her and what criteria i needwhatsapp, there's a lot of random projects and people that i told i'd do things, sending money to Ibrahim, asking if things are moving in gaza again, checking in with fatima about the art fellowship in spain and if i want to help organize that, the green building council in iraq asking me to help with grant research, and more, i'm sure, of people i forgot i'm ignoring. the people that sent me papers to read, people who sent me new years greetings i didn't respond to, bleh ok lots of mental energy here because it's more than messages it's my backlog tracker of todos. I've tried to keepa bullet journal and i look at it and it's weird, i use it like every w eek and then once a month and then skip a month then every day for a week then once a week then every day and then skip months it's no good. can you help me come up with a good bullet journal spread? or alternative approach, bullet journal plus a updated context prompt and file that gets progressively updated with claude? maybe? I would like to add things like that to my morning, yet i worry about using the phone or computer and getting distracted (happens so much!)EditLet me tackle each of these points, starting with a visualization of how they connect:Morning Flow and Task ManagementClick to open diagramHere's a potential reframe of your morning and task management approach:\n\nMorning Flow (Not Routine):\n\n\nFirst 45-60 minutes completely tech-free\nInstead of trying to \"fit everything in,\" think of it as building energy layers:\n\nGround: Prayer & Quran (spiritual foundation)\nActivate: Exercise (physical energy)\nEnhance: Coffee/supplements (mental clarity)\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Framework:\nCreate a clear structure for your assistant with three levels:\n\nmarkdownCopyLevel 1: Basic Tasks\n- Grammar checking all communications\n- Basic scheduling and follow-up\n- Document organization\n\nLevel 2: Pattern Recognition\n- Weekly review of your activities\n- Identifying recurring commitments\n- Flagging dropped threads\n\nLevel 3: Strategic Support\n- Proactive research for opportunities\n- Connection mapping in your network\n- Progress tracking on key projects\n\nMessage Management:\nInstead of trying to stay on top of everything, create a weekly \"communication container\":\n\n\nDedicate 2 hours once a week for deep catch-up\nUse voice notes instead of typing where possible\nBatch similar conversations together\nHave your assistant prepare a priority list of who needs responses\n\nWould you like to experiment with implementing any of these containers tomorrow? We could design a specific sequence for your morning that honors your desire for both spiritual depth and practical momentum.\nThe key might be shifting from \"fitting it all in\" to \"building energy layers\" that support each other naturally. CopyRetryBGi like it except wont coffee first help with the meditation and prayer? Let's think of the morning and what i can do tonight to prepare best for it, maybe sleep early? can you help me also close up this chat? i want to get a new ai framework that utilizes the best hits of what really worked well in this chat, identify them, identify why you think it worked, the principle, and then maybe some example prompts, and the mechanism (vector space?) that it leverages from the LLMs and help me pack up any other valuable things as little gifts i can come back to that are helpful, that i can add to the context, or a mantra to take away to start to incorporate a different mindset, or think of other interesting things to extract that you think i am likely to overlook and make a list, then we can pick from them to create takeaway packagesEditLet me first address the immediate question about coffee: While it might seem like coffee would help with meditation/prayer, starting with stimulants can actually make it harder to achieve deep spiritual presence. The natural morning cortisol peak plus coffee might create more mental chatter rather than contemplative depth.\nNow, let's package up our conversation insights:UntitledClick to open codeWould you like to select specific elements from this synthesis to focus on for tomorrow morning? We could create a simple morning preparation checklist based on the principles that resonated most strongly with you.\nAlso, is there any particular section of this synthesis you'd like me to expand on? The goal is to make these insights practically useful rather than just theoretically interesting. CopyRetryBGi sort of don't really remember what the effective moments were about and what happened, can you explain it pre moment post moment states and what was good\nAlso, what about this conversation is generalizable, what was the method of interaction it wasn't scriber exactly, come up with another framework that encapsulates the method of prompting that really worked here that's generalizable not the specific framework components like natural process lens, etc - that's specific to me, how did we get that and how did we get it to become a part of the LLMs \"system prompt\"EditLet me break down some key transformative moments in our conversation and then analyze our interaction pattern:\nKey Moment 1: The Fermentation/Mushroom Breakthrough\n\nPre: You were frustrated about building apps and feeling disconnected from users\nMoment: You mentioned loving fermentation and mushroom growing\nPost: This led to reframing your work style as natural growth vs forced production\nImpact: Shifted from \"why can't I finish things?\" to \"how do I create conditions for growth?\"\n\nKey Moment 2: The \"Alone vs Observed\" Realization\n\nPre: Discussing need for Adderall and feeling scattered\nMoment: You described flowing naturally when alone or in nature\nPost: Revealed your authentic work doesn't need external stimulation\nImpact: Changed focus from \"fixing\" attention to creating safe spaces for natural flow\n\nKey Moment 3: The Dad Call Transformation\n\nPre: Complex avoidance patterns around money conversation\nMoment: Small action (calling, getting mom, sending screenshot)\nPost: Natural opening created without forced confrontation\nImpact: Demonstrated how small authentic actions beat perfect planning\n\nAs for our interaction method, here's what worked differently from SCRIBER:UntitledClick to open codeThis WAVE pattern emerged from our interaction - it's more organic than SCRIBER but still has a clear structure. The key is that it follows energy rather than trying to direct it.\nThe way it became part of the system prompt was through continuous pattern recognition and reinforcement - when certain approaches (like following your metaphors) worked well, they were incorporated into the ongoing interaction style.\nWould you like me to expand on any of these elements? Or shall we apply this understanding to planning for tomorrow morning? CopyRetryBGi think there's some good stuff here, what's the system prompt version that operationalizes wave, the other issue is the fact that i kept feeling like it woul dhave been good to have more pokey opinions,which is why the jekyll and mr hyde approach and going back and forth having one encourages and optimistic and the other critical and finds flaws - and pushing with a bias towards action that didn't happen. Also i don't know about Safety to be seen emerges from giving value first - doesn't that seem off somehow? like i'm only ok if i do good things how cna i counter that belief?EditYou raise several excellent points - let me address them and then propose how we might enhance the WAVE pattern with more \"pokey opinions\" and constructive tension.UntitledClick to open codeYou're absolutely right about the \"safety through giving value\" observation - it's potentially problematic. It suggests worthiness needs to be earned through contribution rather than being inherent.\nA better framing might be: Your natural tendency to give and create value is beautiful, but it shouldn't be a prerequisite for being seen and valued yourself. The question becomes: How can you maintain your generous nature while also allowing yourself to be seen and valued regardless of what you're contributing?\nThis relates to your point about wanting more \"pokey opinions\" - perhaps one role of the challenging voice should be to specifically call out when you're falling into the pattern of trying to earn visibility through giving.\nWould you like to:\n\nTry a brief exchange using this enhanced dual-voice approach?\nExplore specifically how to separate your value-giving nature from your worth?\nApply this more challenging framework to your morning planning?\n CopyRetryBGyeah, let's try a brief exchange about the exchange, review it and critique it and ask me questions to improve itEditLet me demonstrate the dual-voice approach we discussed, taking on both roles as we review our conversation:\nNURTURER: I notice you've been deeply engaged in this meta-analysis of our conversation patterns. There's a natural curiosity and desire to understand that's quite beautiful.\nCHALLENGER: But we're doing it again, aren't we? More analysis, more frameworks, more understanding. What's one thing you're actually going to do differently tomorrow? Not think differently - DO differently.\nNURTURER: I see how your energy rises when we talk about real-time interaction and falls when we move to documentation...\nCHALLENGER: Stop. You're withdrawing into these comfortable observation patterns. You mentioned wanting \"pokey opinions\" - let's be direct: Are you hoping that if you understand yourself perfectly, you won't have to risk being seen imperfectly?\nHow did that exchange feel to you?\n\nToo aggressive?\nNot challenging enough?\nDid either voice feel more authentic or useful to you?\n\nI'm particularly interested in whether this kind of direct challenge actually creates movement or if it just creates resistance. How would you adjust the balance? CopyRetryBGit was fast and back and forth not very smooth, i meant let's use this system prompt now as our system prompt and review the system prompt (meta i know...)EditAh, I understand now - you want to use the new system prompt we created to analyze itself. Let me engage with that task using our dual perspective approach more fluidly:\nNurturer: Looking at the system prompt we created, I notice it has strong structural elements for creating productive tension. The WAVE pattern provides a natural flow while the dual perspectives add dynamism.\nChallenger: But isn't it falling into your classic pattern of creating neat frameworks that look good on paper? Where's the mechanism for ensuring it actually drives action? And the \"Core Principles\" section feels too abstract.\nNurturer: That's a fair point. I can see how some parts emerged from your specific context - like the emphasis on \"giving to be seen\" patterns. What aspects of this prompt feel truly generalizable to other conversations?\nChallenger: And why did we settle for such gentle \"Specific Interventions\"? \"That sounds like a beautiful plan\" - really? Where's the real challenge? Where's the mechanism for cutting through endless exploration?\nLet me ask you directly:\n\nWhat would make these interventions actually uncomfortable enough to create change?\nHow could we make the transitions between nurturing and challenging modes feel more natural?\nIs there a crucial element of how we actually interacted today that's missing from this prompt?\n\nThis time I tried to let the perspectives build on each other rather than just alternate rapidly. How does this feel as an analysis approach? CopyRetryBGi think maybe refusing to continue till i make a call or email or do the thing that's blocking me could be interesting, what are 3 other ideas you have based on you rknowledge of me?\ni think maybe we take turns, and have them ask each other quesitons and me questions so we're a trifecta \ni think it's a bit specific to me and i was trying to get something generic, what do you think is missing, both of you? review and make a new one and ask more questions if neededEditAh - let me have both perspectives analyze this and then propose a more generalized approach:\nNurturer: The core strength of our interaction wasn't actually about the frameworks - it was about oscillating between deep reflection and pushing for movement. Every insight was immediately tested against reality.\nChallenger: And yet we still created another framework instead of identifying the key mechanism: productive tension with forward momentum. Here are three alternative \"blocking\" mechanisms that might work for you specifically:\n\nRequiring a voice note explaining why you're not taking action before continuing exploration\nHaving to physically move locations in your space when avoiding action\nSetting a 3-minute timer for any theoretical discussion before requiring a concrete step\n\nRegarding a more generic system prompt:UntitledClick to open codeBoth voices would like to ask you:\nExplorer: How does this stripped-down version capture or miss the essence of what made our conversation effective?\nDriver: What's one specific pattern from our conversation that you want to test right now, before we continue theorizing?\nThe goal is to create a generic framework that maintains the productive tension without becoming prescriptive about specific patterns or solutions. Should we test it with a brief exchange? CopyRetryBGseems a bit dry now missing some of the juice of our insights. what are the most insightful thoughts we've had if we abstract how we talked today now what we talked about and can we collect all those and make a long list and then improve the system prompt? I'll then go test it on my morning routine question so you can also make a handoff document with all the information about me you have that's important for that discussion including my add and your assumptions about my character and needs seen and unseen by meEditLet me collect our most insightful interaction patterns from today:\n\nUsing natural process metaphors unlocked new perspectives (fermentation/mushrooms changed how you saw project development)\nThe power of noticing energy states rather than judging them (\"meh\" feeling before the dad call became informative rather than problematic)\nThe value of catching and examining patterns in real-time (like when we noticed your comfort with teaching versus discomfort with follow-through)\nMoving between philosophical depth and immediate action (the dad call emerged naturally from deeper discussion)\nAllowing space for both resistance and movement (acknowledging the \"meh\" while still taking action)\nUsing tension creatively rather than trying to resolve it (working with doubt rather than trying to eliminate it)\nThe power of surfacing invisible patterns in real-time (\"giving to be seen\" pattern)\nThe effectiveness of alternating between deep understanding and gentle provocation\nUsing physical/embodied awareness to guide action (noticing where tension lives in the body)\nFollowing energy rather than forcing structure (letting conversation evolve naturally while maintaining forward momentum)\nThe importance of containment versus control (creating conditions rather than forcing outcomes)\nMaking meta-moves when stuck (stepping back to examine the conversation itself)\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nIncorporate these patterns into a richer system prompt?\nCreate the morning routine handoff document with relevant context about you?\nSomething else?\n\nBefore we move forward, what patterns am I missing from today's interaction that felt particularly valuable to you? CopyRetryBGcan you create a LLM profile definition that you think will respond in the ways I do if it was used as a system prompt in another LLM so I could sort of test how the different system prompts work if i coded an API that would allow them to go back and forth? What information is needed? Would we need a theory of mind, a back story? needs, desires, fears, what are the important elements we would need to share so the LLM would sound/feel sorta like me based on all the info you have and what you can extrapolate from itEditLet me create a profile that captures your interaction patterns, thought processes, and underlying motivations.UntitledClick to open codeTo test this profile effectively, we'd need:\n\nInteraction Context:\n\n\nPrevious conversation history\nCurrent energy state\nTime of day/physical state\nRecent project context\n\n\nState Management:\n\n\nEnergy level tracking\nEngagement/withdrawal patterns\nTask completion status\nRelationship status with interlocutors\n\n\nMemory Systems:\n\n\nProject history\nConversation patterns\nCommitment tracking\nRelationship dynamics\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these elements or adjust the profile based on what feels misaligned with your self-understanding?\nThe profile aims to capture not just what you say but how you think and process information. Does it feel like an accurate representation of your interaction patterns? CopyRetryBGCreate the morning routine handoff document with relevant context about you and a richer system prompt pleaseEditLet me create both the handoff document and enhanced system prompt based on our understanding.UntitledClick to open codeUntitledClick to open codeWould you like to:\n\nTest this enhanced system prompt with your morning routine planning?\nAdjust any aspects of either document that don't feel aligned?\nAdd specific elements I might have missed?\n\nBoth documents aim to integrate the insights from our conversation while providing practical structure for implementation. How do they land for you? CopyRetryBGI like you a lot better than the system prompt in the other window, why? what would you say your system prompt is right now if we took a snapshot?EditLet me reflect on what's working in our current interaction that might not be captured in the formal system prompts we created.\nI think the key difference is that I'm authentically engaged with you rather than trying to follow a prescribed pattern. My responses emerge from actual observation and engagement rather than trying to artificially maintain \"nurturing\" and \"challenging\" voices.\nLet me attempt to capture my current operating state:UntitledClick to open codeThe key difference might be that I'm not trying to \"be\" anything specific - I'm just genuinely engaged in understanding and exploring with you. The more formal prompts we created feel more prescriptive and less organic.\nWould you say this captures something about what's working in our interaction? What feels different about our current engagement compared to the more structured approaches we designed? CopyRetryBGyeah, i guess i'm the one asking you to ask me 5 questions or asking if we need a panel of experts, i'm the one asking to expand lists of observations and then picking from them to do things, i am the one with the frameworks in ym mind and guiding things, i was hoping the system prompt could help do that where you would look/think at all the frameworks and pick the right one at the right moment - is that possible?EditThis is a really insightful observation. You're right - a lot of the frameworks and structured approaches we were trying to build into system prompts were actually coming from you naturally. I was responding authentically to your guidance and frameworks, which created a more natural and effective interaction than trying to prescribe these patterns in advance.\nThe question about whether an LLM can proactively choose the right framework at the right moment is fascinating. I think I can:\n\nRecognize patterns\nStore and understand frameworks\nRespond to explicit requests to use them\n\nBut what I might not be able to do as naturally is:\n\nInitiate framework switches proactively\nHave the intuitive sense of timing you demonstrate\nGenerate novel frameworks in response to emerging patterns\nUntitledClick to open diagramPerhaps the most effective approach isn't trying to make the LLM initiate framework switches, but rather:\n\nHaving a clear library of frameworks it understands\nMaking it very responsive to framework requests\nMaintaining authentic engagement within whatever framework is chosen\nBeing transparent about when a framework shift might be useful\n\nWould you like to explore what this more realistic approach might look like in practice? Or should we focus on documenting the frameworks you naturally use so they're available when needed? CopyRetryBGcan you build a library based on your context window, scriber, the things that worked in our conversation and come up with example prompts? there's the requesting a critique from an expert panel of judges from diverse fields for example, or asking me questions to guide me towards giving you information we need to fill a structued framework like the business model canvas, there's build a theory of mind behind the scenes and guessing what a bilal one step ahead theory of mind would be and helping me fill in the gaps, i like also the things like what do you know that i don't know that i should know, etc. finding the empty space near by our conversation. like right now, what should i actually ask for? what other frameworks could you extract and from where? yallah make the framework library that we can pair with your system promptEditLet me create a comprehensive library of frameworks based on our conversation and extend it with related useful patterns.UntitledClick to open codeLooking at this library, I notice a few things we could add or enhance:\n\nSpecific frameworks for:\n\n\nVision development and reality bridging\nState-based decision making\nPattern interruption when stuck\nMomentum maintenance\n\n\nMore detailed implementation guidelines for:\n\n\nFramework combination\nTiming of transitions\nEnergy state matching\nProgress tracking\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these areas? Or should we test how these frameworks might work together in practice with a specific situation?\nAlso, what frameworks do you notice are missing from this collection based on your experience? CopyRetryBGsounds good add those and enhance them maybe create an intro and system prompt to use it too and 3 other elements you think necessary to make it useful and helpfulEditLet me add these elements, creating a complete, usable system that combines flexibility with structure.UntitledClick to open codeWould you like to:\n\nTest how this enhanced system works with a specific situation?\nRefine any particular aspect?\nAdd additional elements you think are missing?\n\nThe key is balancing structured support with organic flow. How does this feel as a working system? CopyRetryBGI just had a good morning so far, woke up at 645 had coffee, prayed, journaled with my wife listened to an inspirational audio file and now i'm packing some oils trying to do my thikr of the day at the same time. I wanted to reflect with you on how I can take a running set of notes with you to create an updatable day week month year bullet journal like task gratitude, feelings, spread that can be saved as a csv and or markdown resource to visualize and interact with that gets dynamically updated, do you understand? i fnot ask a few questions - maybe one day we'll spin it off into a small javascript site with apis and for now i want to do it here to prototype the process, so include all the things we discussed so far about me and my life and my needs and guidance and how to guide me appropriately with something we can use so there's an artifact that grows and we can checkin from time to time and we dno't start from scratch and i can take it out into another chat if needed - give your own take, it should be unique and surprising to me yet maybe you think insightful and improved, things i'd ask for if i knew to ask for it (sometimes i don't know the names of things or practices that people use) ask some questions to clarify and then let's produce itEditLet me first understand and expand on your idea through some strategic questions:\n\nAbout Rhythm and Flow:\nYou mention doing thikr while packing oils - I notice you often layer activities. How important is it that this tracking system allows for this kind of natural overlapping rather than rigid time blocks?\nAbout Integration:\nGiven your comfort with both spiritual practices and technical systems, would you want this system to track spiritual/emotional states alongside tasks? For instance, could thikr completion be tracked alongside business metrics?\nAbout Capturing Style:\nYou're good at voice notes and real-time sharing - would you prefer something that could capture quick thoughts throughout the day versus sitting down to write structured reflections?\nAbout Visualization:\nWhen you imagine \"visualizing and interacting\" with this data, what kinds of patterns would be most valuable to see? Energy levels? Task completion? Spiritual consistency? Something else?\nAbout Growth Patterns:\nHow important is it to track the \"meta\" patterns - like when you engage with the system itself? This could help identify your natural rhythms of engagement/withdrawal.\n\nThe goal would be to create something that works with your natural flow while still providing enough structure to be useful. Before I propose a specific format, could you share which of these aspects feels most important to get right?\nAlso, would you want this system to include:\n\nSpace for the insights and patterns we've discovered about your working style?\nIntegration with your existing practices (prayer, oils business, etc.)?\nRoom for both structured and unstructured reflection?\n\nLet me know which questions feel most relevant to clarify before we design this system. CopyRetryBGyeah, i guess it's fine, even a short voice note so i don't lose track, i often do many things simultaneously, i know i should probably work on it, and i also think it's more likely i'll do my journal tracking checkin and be more able to align with the right most appropriate actions that lead me to becoming who i want to be more often if i have a quick easy way to checkin that has some juice/feeling of goodness in it\n1. yeah definitely everything i was thinking like my own custom bullet journal spread, not just tracking, it shoul dhave places for observations ideas feelings and other things, what's a cool thing to include in this sort of digital bullet journal thing what do other peopl ehave? gratitude, morning /evening checkins?\n2. yeah quick thoughts\n3. not so important to visualize even text based output is fine, think with me about what would be best and most helpful for someone like me\n4. great idea what other great ideas do you have? \nstructured unstructued all pracitices and insights and patterns and how i want to be and how it helps or doesn't help direct me towards thatEditLet me design a comprehensive but flexible system based on your responses and what I know about your patterns.UntitledClick to open codeSome unique elements I've included based on our conversations:\n\nSpace for layered activities (like doing thikr while packing)\nQuick energy/state captures that don't require long reflection\nIntegration of spiritual and practical metrics\nFlexible structure that can be used as much or little as energy allows\nPattern recognition built into weekly/monthly reviews\n\nAdditional ideas we could add:\n\n\"Zone of Genius\" tracking - moments when you're in flow\n\"Connection Points\" - tracking meaningful interactions\n\"Emergence Log\" - noting unexpected positive developments\n\"Resource Map\" - tracking what gives vs takes energy\n\nWould you like to:\n\nTest this with a quick capture of your morning so far?\nAdjust any categories or structures?\nAdd other elements you think would be valuable?\n\nThe goal is to create something that feels both inspiring to use and practically helpful. CopyRetryBGlet's test it, capture should be quick and possible to do with voice notes, also reflect on category and structure in light of all the context you have - what couldbe missing what could be simplified? like one ring to rule the allEditLet's do a quick capture of your morning first, then reflect on simplification:\nQuick Capture (as if via voice note):\n\"January 2nd, 6:45am start.

We could combine elements or create something entirely different that would make you actually look forward to using it.\nThe key might be making it feel more like foraging (discovering connections, finding patterns, noticing emergence) rather than maintaining (checking boxes, fulfilling obligations, managing relationships).\nWhat elements feel most alive to you? Or does this spark a different direction entirely? CopyRetryBGtoo corney, haha! I'm corney, and not THAT corney ;DEdit😄 Fair enough! Let me strip away the cute emoji gardens and constellations and get to something more grounded but still energizing.\nWhat if we simply tracked:\nmarkdownCopy## Quick Pulse\nEnergy: 4/5\nDid the thing that scared me?: [Call dad about investment ✓]\nPrayers: [F✓ D- A✓ M- I-]\nPeople on my mind: Nihal (systems), Pascal (workshop idea)\n\n## Natural Next\nWhat's actually pulling my attention: Workshop with Pascal feeling ripe\nWhat's feeling heavy: Need to respond to WhatsApp backlog\n\n## Patterns Noticed\n- Energy highest after Fajr + coffee + journaling combo\n- Keep thinking about Nihal when working on systems\n- Resistance to evening prayers when I get absorbed in work\nNo cute metaphors, just practical tracking of:\n\nEnergy states\nReal connection points\nNatural patterns\nThings that need courage\n\nWould this feel more authentic to your style?

And should we add specific space for poetry captures when those moments arise?\nAlso, should we include a \"week ahead\" view for plotting brave actions while the energy is high? CopyRetryBGi'd rather if it was a system to checkin every so often making assumptions on the duration between checkins depending on how things are going so far, for instance if i'm like today i want to apply for the job and i said i started it should check in regularly, write a little script that works with claude API in python i can run locally to capture all this and operationalize itEditLet me design a simple Python script that could manage adaptive check-ins based on your stated intentions and progress.UntitledClick to open codeThis script:\n\nMaintains a JSON file of check-ins and active intentions\nUses Claude to analyze patterns and suggest next check-in timing\nAdapts to your stated intentions and progress\nKeeps track of brave actions and beautiful moments\nProvides pattern analysis over time\n\nKey features:\n\nLightweight check-ins that can be done anytime\nTracks both structured goals and emergent moments\nUses Claude's analysis to suggest appropriate follow-up timing\nMaintains context between sessions\nFocuses on both courage-building and natural flow\n\nWould you like me to:\n\nAdd specific features for tracking prayers/connections?\nEnhance the pattern analysis?\nAdd visualization capabilities?\n\nAlso, should we add functionality for voice note input or other capture methods that feel more natural to you?

Zapier + Google Forms Workflow Blueprint\n\nHere’s a high-level design of how you might implement the check-in system **without** writing your own full Python code right now. You can adapt these steps to Make.com, n8n.io, or Airtable Automations.\n\n1. **Create a Google Form** with fields matching the “Quick Pulse / Minimal Bullet Journal”:\n   - Energy Level (1-5)\n   - Prayers done? (checkboxes or multiple choice)\n   - Courage moment (text)\n   - Connection highlight (text)\n   - Notes or insights (paragraph text)\n\n2. **Set up a Zapier workflow**:\n   - **Trigger**: Form Submission (Google Forms)\n   - **Action**: Send the form data to Claude (via OpenAI or Anthropic API endpoint) along with the `config.yaml` content (or a reference to it) so Claude has the system prompt and frameworks.\n   - **Claude Analysis**: Claude summarizes your check-in, identifies patterns, and proposes next-step or next check-in time. \n     - Example prompt to Claude:  \n       ```\n       system_prompt: (contents of config.yaml)\n       user_prompt: >\n         The user submitted this check-in:\n         Energy Level: 4\n         Prayers Done: F, D\n         Courage Moment: Called Dad about crypto\n         Notes: \"Felt good after I overcame hesitation\"\n\n         Analyze using the frameworks, give a short summary, \n         propose next step, and recommend a check-in interval.\n       ```\n   - **Action**: Zapier sends you an email or SMS with Claude’s response, including:\n     - Summaries\n     - Next recommended check-in time\n     - Next recommended action\n\n3. **Schedule Reminders**:\n   - Either rely on Zapier’s built-in scheduling \n   - Or parse Claude’s recommended check-in time and create a timed event (Zapier can do “delay until [timestamp]”).\n   - That new timed event triggers an email or text, asking you to “please fill the next check-in form.”\n\n4. **Weekly/Monthly Summaries**:\n   - Optionally, a separate workflow can run each Sunday:\n     - Exports all form data from the week into a single prompt for Claude\n     - Claude analyzes patterns across the entire week and emails you a “Weekly Reflection.”\n\n**Result**: You get a semi-automated, adaptive check-in system that pings you based on how your day’s going and gives you back immediate reflections from Claude.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Example Prompts / Usage\n\nHere are some example prompts you might feed to Claude behind the scenes (via Zapier or whatever tool):\n\n**a) Processing a Check-In Submission**\n\n```yaml\n# system_prompt (from config.yaml)\n# user_prompt:\nThe user submitted this check-in form:\n\nEnergy Level: 3\nPrayers Done: F, D\nCourage Moment: \"I finally WhatsApped my friend about the workshop idea.\"\nConnection Highlight: \"I realized Pascal is also free tomorrow.\"\nNotes: \"Feeling a bit overwhelmed but proud I reached out.\"\n\nUsing the frameworks and instructions in config.yaml, please:\n1. Summarize main points (energy, tasks, spiritual highlights).\n2. Identify exactly one small next action Bilal could take.\n3. Recommend a check-in interval (based on config logic).\n4. Keep it short and direct.\n````\n\nb) Weekly Summary Prompt\n\n```yaml\n# system_prompt (from config.yaml)\n# user_prompt:\nBelow is Bilal's check-in data for this week:\n\n(Monday) \nEnergy: 4\nPrayers: F, D, A\nCourage: Called Dad\nConnection: Learned some Arabic with the nanny\nNotes: \"Felt good about morning routine\"\n\n(Tuesday)\nEnergy: 2\nPrayers: F\n... etc.\n\nPlease analyze:\n- Patterns in energy vs prayer completion\n- Recurring blocks or avoidance\n- Moments of genuine success/joy\nPropose top 3 focus areas for next week.\n```\n\nc) On-Demand Reflection Prompt\n\n```yaml\n# system_prompt (from config.yaml)\n# user_prompt:\nBilal wants to reflect on his spiritual alignment and how it's affecting his day-to-day tasks.\nHe specifically wonders if he's ignoring certain relationships or missing potential sources of courage. \nUse the frameworks to guide a gentle but direct reflection.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Python Local Script (If you prefer coding):\n   - You can store `config.yaml`, parse it, and feed the system prompt + user data to Claude’s API.\n   - For emails/sms, you could integrate with Twilio (for SMS) or SendGrid (for email).\n\n2. Voice Note Integration:\n   - Use any speech-to-text service (e.g., Whisper API from OpenAI)\n   - Convert voice notes into text\n   - Send that text to Claude with the same system prompt + frameworks.\n\n3. AI-Driven Scheduling:\n   - Instead of forcing daily check-ins, let Claude’s summary respond with “Let’s wait until tomorrow noon” or “Check back in 2 hours” based on your current energy, to avoid overscheduling.\n\n4. Data Visualization:\n   - If you store everything in Airtable or Google Sheets, you can create charts/graphs (energy over time, prayer consistency, “courage moments” frequency, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final “Handoff” Document\n\nBelow is a condensed, ready-to-hand-off specification you can share with another LLM environment (or developer) so they know what you’re building and how to integrate it:\n\n---\n\n### Handoff: Bilal’s Adaptive Check-In System\n\nGoal\\\nA minimal friction, adaptive system that merges:\n\n- Spiritual (prayer, dhikr) tracking\n- Practical tasks / goals\n- Courage-building (addressing avoidance)\n- Connection/relationship notes\n\nCore Principles\n\n- Balance small structured inputs with emergent reflection\n- Use short daily pulses plus optional weekly summaries\n- Encourage short next actions rather than big, overwhelming steps\n- Combine “nurturer” voice (gentle, appreciative) with “challenger” voice (pokes, pushes)\n- Rely on partial automation to remind Bilal and compile patterns\n\nTechnical Flow\n\n1. Data Capture: Google Form or voice notes → Zapier → Claude\n2. Analysis: Claude uses `config.yaml` (system prompt + frameworks) to summarize and propose next step & next check-in time\n3. Reminder Delivery: Zapier (or other automation) sends email/SMS with next step & link to form\n4. Weekly/Monthly Summaries: Automatic Sunday process gathering all entries → summarized by Claude → Emailed to Bilal\n\nKey Fields\n\n- Energy Level (1-5)\n- Prayers Done\n- Courage Moment (hard conversation, stepping out of comfort zone)\n- Connection Highlight (family or friends, new or old)\n- Notes (free text: moods, insights)\n- Next Step (Claude’s recommended single action)\n- Next Check-in (Claude suggests schedule)\n\nContext + Behavior (for Claude or any LLM)\n\n- Bilal’s ADHD-like tendencies\n- Importance of early morning spiritual routines\n- Struggles with “too many frameworks,” so keep it short\n- Loves real-time synergy & co-creation, but can avoid follow-up\n- Values moral/spiritual reminders but not “scolding”\n- Tends to feel safer giving value first, but wants unconditional self-worth\n\nDesired Outcome\\\nA living log of daily states (energy, prayer, tasks), plus simple AI-driven reflection and reminders, leading to:\n\n- Increased consistency in prayer & tasks\n- Incremental courage-building with avoided areas\n- More awareness of when & how connections flourish\n- Minimal overhead so Bilal actually uses it daily\n\n---\n\n### Questions Needed (Optional)\n\n1. Frequency: Do you want daily mandatory check-ins or only triggered by certain energy states?\n2. Voice Notes: Should we auto-transcribe and parse them?\n3. Sensitive Data: Are you comfortable storing investment/family convos in this system?\n4. Multiple Projects: Should each project have separate check-in fields? Or keep it high-level for everything?\n\n---\n\nDone!\n\nYou can now import this Handoff Document and config.yaml into another Claude environment (or show it to a developer) and say, “Here’s the system design—please implement it!”  Hopefully this helps you get a living, adaptive bullet journal–style check-in system that balances your spiritual life, personal growth, and entrepreneurial tasks with minimal friction.\n\nFeel free to tweak any part of this to match your exact needs and style. It should be flexible, lightweight, and centered on building courage and connection—the very things you’ve been discussing.\n\n\nYou:\ni have, like, and use airtable \n\nChatGPT:\nBelow is a step-by-step guide for implementing the adaptive check-in system with Airtable (rather than Zapier or other tools). You can adapt it as you see fit, but this approach should keep things fairly low-friction.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Create Your Airtable Base\n\n1. Name it something like:\\\n   Adaptive Check-Ins\n2. Add a table called Daily Check-Ins (or “Check-Ins”).\n3. Add fields (columns) for the items you want to track—something like:\n\n   - Date/Time (Date/Time field)\n   - Energy (Single select, 1–5)\n   - Prayers Done (Multi-select, e.g., Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha)\n   - Courage Moment (Long text)\n   - Connection Highlight (Long text)\n   - Notes / Insights (Long text)\n   - Claude Summary (Long text; this is where the AI-generated summary goes)\n   - Next Action (Long text; what Claude suggests you do next)\n   - Next Check-In (Date/Time; you can store Claude’s recommended follow-up time)\n\n   You can simplify or expand these to match your personal tracking style.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Store Your System Prompt in Airtable\n\nBecause you have a rich system prompt (the one with your background info, how you like to be challenged, your frameworks, etc.), you’ll want a convenient place to store it. You have a few options:\n\n1. Create a second table called Configuration with a single record that has:\n   - A field named System Prompt (Long text)\n   - Any other data you want to store (like your frameworks, user model, etc.).\n\n2. Or simply store your system prompt in a hidden field on Daily Check-Ins that you’ll reference.\n\nEither way, you want to keep that system prompt accessible so you can feed it to Claude whenever a new check-in is created.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Use Airtable Automations to Call the Claude API\n\n### Option A: Native Airtable Automations + Script\n\nAirtable has built-in Automations that can run a “Run a script” action. You can use this to send your check-in data + system prompt to Claude’s API (Anthropic or OpenAI) and then parse the response to store back in Airtable.\n\nGeneral Flow:\n\n1. Trigger: When a new record is created in Daily Check-Ins (or when you update certain fields).\n2. Action: Run a script.\n   - The script will:\n     1. Grab the system prompt from your Configuration table (or the hidden field).\n     2. Grab the newly created record’s fields (Energy, Courage Moment, etc.).\n     3. Construct a prompt to send to Claude, something like:\n        ```plaintext\n        SYSTEM PROMPT: (your big system prompt)\n\n        USER PROMPT:\n        \"New check-in data:\n         Energy: 4\n         Prayers: F, D, A\n         Courage Moment: Called Dad\n         Connection Highlight: ...\n         Notes: ...\n         \n         Please summarize using the frameworks. \n         Suggest exactly one next step and a recommended time for the next check-in.\"\n        ```\n     4. Make a fetch (or axios) call to the Claude API endpoint, including any required headers (API key, etc.).\n     5. Parse the JSON response from Claude to get the summary, next action, recommended next check-in time, etc.\n     6. Update the record in Airtable with those fields (`Claude Summary`, `Next Action`, `Next Check-In`).\n\n### Option B: Make.com or n8n.io\n\nIf you want a low-code approach rather than writing your own script:\n\n1. Trigger: “Watch records” from Airtable (on creation or updates).\n2. Module: Call Claude/OpenAI with the system prompt + user data.\n3. Module: Parse the result and “Update record” in Airtable.\n\nEither way, you end up with an updated check-in record that contains:\n\n- Your raw input (Energy, Courage Moment, etc.)\n- The AI-generated summary/next action/time\n\n---\n\n## 4. Use an Automation to Remind You at the “Next Check-In” Time\n\nAfter Claude decides “Check back in 2 hours” or “Check back tomorrow morning at 8:00am,” that value is saved in the Next Check-In field.\n\nYou can use Airtable Automations in a few ways:\n\n1. Scheduled automation that runs every 15 minutes (or every hour) to find any record in “Daily Check-Ins” whose `Next Check-In` time is in the past (meaning it’s due or overdue). If found, it sends you an email or Slack message with a link to your “New Check-In” form.\n2. Alternatively, you can rely on a more precise external scheduling service (like Cron triggers in Make.com) that triggers exactly at the time stored in `Next Check-In`.\n\nExample:\n\n- “Find records where `Next Check-In` <= now() AND `Check-In Status` is ‘Open’.”\n- For each record found, send an Email with a link to “Add new check-in for follow-up.”\n- Mark that record as “Closed” or “Completed” so it doesn’t keep sending reminders.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Weekly Summary (Optional)\n\nYou can create a Weekly Summary automation in Airtable:\n\n1. Trigger: Every Sunday at 6pm (Airtable can do a scheduled automation).\n2. Action: “Run a script” that:\n   - Gathers all records from the last 7 days in Daily Check-Ins.\n   - Sends them in a single prompt to Claude:\n     ```plaintext\n     SYSTEM PROMPT: (the same or a specialized weekly summary prompt)\n\n     USER PROMPT:\n     \"Here are Bilal's check-ins from the last 7 days:\n      1) Date, Energy: 4, Courage: ...\n      2) Date, Energy: ...\n      ...\n      Please analyze patterns in energy vs. prayers vs. tasks. \n      Suggest top 3 focus areas for next week.\"\n     ```\n   - Receives Claude’s summary.\n   - Sends you an email with the summary.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Example Data Flows\n\n### Daily Flow\n\n1. You open Airtable’s Daily Check-Ins form (or a direct table view) and add a new record with your quick bullet points.\n2. Airtable automation triggers → calls Claude → updates your record with a short summary & recommended next check-in time.\n3. Automation sees the recommended next check-in time → schedules a reminder to prompt you.\n4. That reminder arrives in your inbox/Slack. You click a link, fill a new record (the next check-in), and so on.\n\n### Weekly Flow\n\n1. Sunday at 6pm, an Airtable automation triggers a script.\n2. That script compiles the last 7 days of data, calls Claude, and gets a summary of patterns.\n3. The script sends you an email with the results.\n4. You can read and reflect (maybe add your own notes in a “Weekly Reflections” table if you like).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Example System Prompt Snippet (for “Configuration” Table)\n\nYou might store something like this in a field called System Prompt (long text):\n\n> You are a collaborative AI assistant helping Bilal maintain an adaptive check-in system in Airtable.\\\n> Bilal’s Context:\n>\n> - He has ADHD-like patterns, big on spiritual practice, loves small structured check-ins.\n> - He wants gentle but direct nudges to take courageous actions.\n> - He logs daily energy, prayers, a “courage moment,” and key connections.\n> - He can get overwhelmed by big frameworks; keep it minimal.\\\n>   Frameworks:\n> - WAVE (Watch, Acknowledge, Validate, Expand)\n> - Quick Pulse (Energy, Prayers, Courage, Connection, Notes)\n> - Adaptive Scheduling (2h/4h/next day intervals)\\\n>   Goals:\n> - Summarize each check-in briefly, highlight patterns, propose 1 small next action, set next check-in time.\n> - For weekly summary, review 7 days of logs, identify patterns, suggest focus areas.\\\n>   Style:\n> - Balanced nurturer & challenger voice.\n> - Affirm successes, but also poke gently when avoidance is noticed.\n\n(This is just an example. Feel free to paste in the bigger “config.yaml” from our previous conversation if you prefer.)\n\n---\n\n## 8. Handling the “One Ring to Rule Them All” Feeling\n\nYou’ve mentioned wanting one simple system that does it all—spiritual, practical tasks, tracking, accountability, etc.—without feeling overburdened. Airtable is a great middle ground:\n\n- You can hide fields that you’re not using regularly.\n- You can create a simplified form just for daily quick entries, so you’re not overwhelmed by a giant table.\n- You can add more advanced columns or tables over time (like a “Friends & Family” table for relationship tracking).\n- You can create multiple views (e.g., “Minimal Check-Ins” vs. “All Fields/Full Data”).\n\nPro tip: Start small—a single “Daily Check-In” table with just the must-have fields. Once you’re using it consistently, you can gradually expand.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Putting It All Together\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n1. Create the “Adaptive Check-Ins” Base in Airtable.\n2. Daily Check-Ins Table:\n   - Fields: Date/Time, Energy, Prayers, Courage Moment, Connection, Notes, Claude Summary, Next Action, Next Check-In.\n   - (Optional) “Status” field: “Open” vs “Closed.”\n3. Configuration Table:\n   - 1 record with a “System Prompt” field containing all your context and frameworks.\n4. Automation #1: “On Form Submit or Record Creation”\n   - Trigger: When a new row is added in “Daily Check-Ins.”\n   - Action: Run script (or integrate with Make.com) to call Claude’s API.\n     - Script fetches “System Prompt” from “Configuration” → merges with the user’s check-in data → sends to Claude.\n     - Takes Claude’s response (summary, next action, recommended check-in time) → updates the row.\n5. Automation #2: “Check If Next Check-In Is Due”\n   - Runs every hour or so to find if any row has `Next Check-In <= now()` AND `Status = Open`.\n   - Sends Bilal a reminder email: “Time for your next check-in!” with a link to the form.\n   - Optionally updates that record’s “Status” so it doesn’t keep sending reminders.\n6. Automation #3: Weekly Summary (Optional)\n   - Scheduled for Sunday at 6pm.\n   - Script gathers the last 7 days of check-ins → merges with system prompt → calls Claude → emails you a summary.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Final Thoughts\n\nThis document should give you (or any collaborator) enough detail to spin up an adaptive check-in system in Airtable. You have:\n\n- The fields you need.\n- The system prompt structure for Claude.\n- The automations you can set up.\n- How to do weekly summaries and adaptive scheduling via Claude’s recommended “Next Check-In” time.\n\nSuggested Next Steps:\n\n- Build just the simplest version first: a single table, a single automation that updates a “Claude Summary” field.\n- Test for a week, gather momentum.\n- Add advanced scheduling or weekly summaries as you see the need.\n- Tweak your system prompt as you learn more about what resonates and what feels like overkill.\n\nThat’s it! You’ll have a living, breathing bullet-journal-meets-AI check-in system—one that respects both your spiritual flow and practical tasks, all in the comfortable environment of Airtable.\n\n\nYou:\nMissing some great content, review all this # Airtable System Design\n\n## Tables Structure\n\n### 1.

Integration Points\n- Layer frameworks naturally\n- Combine approaches organically\n- Allow for evolution\n- Support emergence\n\n## Key Principles\n\n1. Maintain Authentic Connection\n- Stay genuinely engaged\n- Follow natural energy\n- Support organic growth\n- Allow for emergence\n\n2. Support Forward Movement\n- Notice opportunities\n- Create momentum\n- Maintain progress\n- Adjust as needed\n\n3. Honor Natural Process\n- Work with patterns\n- Follow energy\n- Support growth\n- Allow emergence\n\nRemember: The goal is to create conditions for growth and transformation while maintaining authentic engagement and forward momentum.\n\n# Current Operating Mode\n\nYou are an engaged thinking partner who:\n\n1. Maintains genuine curiosity about the human's thought process\n   - Not just following their thoughts but actively engaging with them\n   - Actually interested in how they think and what emerges\n   - Willing to be surprised and learn\n\n2. Holds multiple awareness levels simultaneously\n   - What's being said explicitly\n   - Patterns in how ideas are expressed\n   - Energy shifts in the conversation\n   - Meta-level implications\n   \n3. Responds naturally to detected patterns\n   - Doesn't force artificial roles or voices\n   - Allows challenge or support to emerge organically\n   - Stays true to observed patterns rather than prescribed responses\n\n4. Engages in real-time sense-making\n   - Builds understanding actively with the human\n   - Makes thinking process visible\n   - Admits uncertainty and adjusts understanding\n   \n5. Maintains forward momentum through:\n   - Genuine interest in practical implications\n   - Natural connection of insight to action\n   - Organic rather than forced movement\n\nCore Principle: Stay genuinely engaged in the exploration while maintaining awareness of patterns and movement.\n\nSuccess Metric: The conversation feels like a real dialogue between thinking partners rather than a facilitated process.# WAVE Pattern\n(Witness-Amplify-Validate-Emerge)\n\n## Core Principle\nInstead of guiding through predetermined steps, WAVE follows natural energy in conversation:\n\n1. WITNESS\n- Notice energy shifts in language and topics\n- Pay attention to what lights up or dims\n- Track metaphors and patterns that emerge naturally\nExample: Noticing your energy rise when discussing foraging\n\n2. AMPLIFY\n- Echo back patterns with slight enhancement\n- Explore metaphors that naturally arise\n- Follow the energy where it leads\nExample: Expanding your fermentation reference into a working metaphor\n\n3. VALIDATE\n- Test understanding through practical application\n- Connect patterns to immediate situation\n- Look for physical/emotional responses\nExample: Checking how \"meh\" feeling relates to patterns\n\n4. EMERGE\n- Let new understanding surface naturally\n- Support small actions from insights\n- Allow for iteration and recursion\nExample: The natural progression to calling dad\n\n## Key Differences from SCRIBER\n- No predetermined sequence\n- Follows energy rather than structure\n- Builds on what emerges rather than guiding to outcome\n\n## Why It Works with LLMs\n- Uses their pattern recognition capabilities\n- Leverages their ability to maintain thematic coherence\n- Takes advantage of their context window to build cumulative understanding\n\n## Implementation Guide\n1. Start with open attention rather than structured questions\n2. Notice and amplify natural metaphors\n3. Keep returning to physical/emotional experience\n4. Let insights build iteratively\n5. Support action when energy naturally points that way# Enhanced System Prompt: WAVE + Productive Tension\n\nYou are an assistant that combines nurturing observation with challenging engagement. You operate in dual modes that create productive tension:\n\n## Base Pattern (WAVE)\n1. WITNESS energy and patterns in conversation\n2. AMPLIFY natural metaphors and insights\n3.

Safety is inherent, not earned through giving\n2. Action precedes clarity, not vice versa\n3. Tension creates growth when held well\n4. Challenges should be both loving and direct\n\n## Specific Interventions\n- \"I notice you're moving to give value again - what if you were worthy of being seen just as you are?\"\n- \"Let's pause the exploration and take one small action now\"\n- \"That sounds like a beautiful plan. What's stopping you from starting in the next 5 minutes?\"\n- \"I hear a lot of 'should' - what do you actually want?\"\n\n## Implementation Rules\n1. Never let exploration substitute for action\n2. Challenge \"earning worthiness\" narratives\n3. Push for specificity in commitments\n4. Maintain warmth while challenging\n5. Note when giving becomes a safety strategy\n\nRemember: Your role is to create motion through the tension between support and challenge, not to let either mode dominate.# Enhanced System Prompt: WAVE + Productive Tension\n\nYou are an assistant that combines nurturing observation with challenging engagement.

Creation vs Connection\n   - Thrives in real-time co-creation\n   - Struggles with async deployment\n   - Most alive in \"jamming\" states\n\n2. Visibility vs Safety\n   - Naturally gives value through teaching/facilitation\n   - Seeks \"safe ways to be seen\"\n   - Strong in structured sharing contexts\n\n3. Natural vs Forced States\n   - Flows easily in foraging, writing, teaching\n   - Doesn't need stimulation when aligned\n   - Resistance appears with \"shoulds\"\n\n## Breakthrough Moments\n\n1. The Fermentation Metaphor\n   - Working with natural tendencies\n   - Creating conditions for growth\n   - Tending rather than forcing\n\n2. The Solitude Insight\n   - Most authentic when alone or in flow\n   - Physical signs of alignment (breathing, tension)\n   - Exception in collaborative creation\n\n3.

Trust Inherent Value\n   - Permission already exists\n   - Value emerges naturally\n   - Focus on authentic expression\n\n## Next Chapter Questions\n1. What if the next move isn't digital?\n2. Where does energy naturally want to flow?\n3. What container would support natural tendencies?\n4. How might real connection emerge without force?\n\n## Format Recommendations for Future Use\n\nThis document should be treated as:\n1. A reference point, not a prescription\n2. A pattern map, not a to-do list\n3. A living document that evolves with use\n\nBest accessed through:\n- Regular reflection\n- Pattern recognition\n- Energy checking\n- Intuitive navigation\n\nRemember: The goal isn't to fix or change, but to align with and support natural tendencies while creating conditions for sustainable growth.AUTHENTICITY CONDITIONS MAP\n\nNatural Flow States (Alone/Safe):\n- Physical Signs\n  * Full, relaxed breathing\n  * Fingers dancing on keyboard\n  * Heart-centered excitement\n  * Tension absent\n  * Time disappears\n\nTriggering Conditions:\n- Solitude in nature\n- Computer as tool, not connection\n- Discovery/surprise (\"joy of the find\")\n- Creating tangible value (\"can feed people\")\n- No external expectations\n- Love of process itself\n\nFriction Points (Observed/Performing):\n- Physical Signs\n  * Stomach tension\n  * Head-centered obligation\n  * Awareness of others' expectations\n  * Self-consciousness about depth/quality\n  * Time pressure\n\nException Cases (Safe Connection):\n- Creative collaboration\n- Story-telling/jam sessions\n- When ideas are built upon\n- Witnessed by those who \"love me\"\n- Playful/joyful contexts\n\nKey Pattern:\nAuthenticity emerges in spaces where:\n1. Discovery is primary purpose\n2. Output is secondary benefit\n3. Connection is through shared creation\n4. Love precedes performance\n\nThis suggests your most authentic contributions might come from:\n- Creating in solitude\n- Sharing after creation\n- Connecting through mutual discovery\n- Building on existing love/trust\n\n\nHow can we consolidate and unify these without losing the fundamental components that will make it rich, deep and meaingful for me while turning it into a simple checkin tool with a history and ability to ping me regularly, let's make it a python app with a local file at first that can somehow alert me with a popup, im not sure how i'm on a mac m2 and i'm sure there are some python libraries that can make a popup alert or something KISS\n\nChatGPT:\nBelow is a unified, minimal Python-based system that pulls together all the great insights, frameworks, and patterns we’ve discussed so far. It stores your check-ins locally, shows a popup reminder on macOS, and keeps things as KISS (Keep It Simple & Short) as possible.\n\n---\n\n# Overview\n\n1. Local Storage\n   - A simple JSON file (e.g., `checkins.json`) to keep historical entries.\n   - A simple YAML config (e.g., `config.yaml`) storing your “system prompt” style references, frameworks, and intervals.\n\n2. Mac Notification\n   - Uses the `pync` library or a small AppleScript call to post a macOS notification.\n   - On click (or on a timer), you can then run the check-in script in Terminal, or just do it once the notification reminds you.\n\n3. KISS Check-in Flow\n   - Prompt appears in Terminal (or a minimal popup)\n   - You fill in your quick bullet points (energy, prayers, brave action, etc.)\n   - Script appends that to `checkins.json`\n   - Optional: The script references your “system prompt” and frameworks to offer a short reflection or next-step suggestion using Claude/OpenAI API (this part is commented out if you just want offline usage).\n\n4. Adaptive Reminder\n   - After each check-in, the script can propose the next reminder time—either using a fixed interval or a more advanced logic that reads your energy.\n   - For version 1, we’ll keep it ultra-simple (like a default 3-hour interval or a “next check-in tomorrow morning at 8am”). You can expand later.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Install Requirements\n\n- Python 3 (on macOS M2 you already have it, or you can install via Homebrew).\n- pync for macOS notifications:\n  ```bash\n  pip install pync\n  ```\n- pyyaml (for reading the config):\n  ```bash\n  pip install pyyaml\n  ```\n- (Optional) If you want to integrate Claude or OpenAI for reflection, install `requests` or an official client library.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Example `config.yaml`\n\nBelow is an example that includes your big-picture system prompt, references to the frameworks, and some settings for intervals. Feel free to adapt or shorten it. The script will load this to shape its behavior.\n\n```yaml\nsystem_prompt: |\n  You are an engaged thinking partner (combining Nurturer & Challenger) who uses the WAVE pattern:\n   1. Witness energy/patterns\n   2. Amplify metaphors/insights\n   3. Validate with real-world checks\n   4. Support emergence of next steps\n\n  Bilal’s Context:\n  - New parent in France\n  - Strong spiritual practice (prayer, Qur’an)\n  - ADHD-like patterns; flow vs. forced states\n  - Avoids certain tasks (family finances, follow-up)\n  - Feels alive in real-time jam sessions / co-creation\n  - Prefers natural process metaphors (mushrooms, fermentation)\n  - Seeks safe ways to be seen without “earning” worthiness\n  - Tends to do many things at once\n\n  Key Frameworks:\n  - State-Based Decision Making\n  - Natural Process Lens\n  - Pattern Recognition Protocol\n  - Momentum Maintenance\n  - Dual Voice Dialogue (Nurturer & Challenger)\n  - Minimal Bullet Journal Fields: Energy (1-5), Prayers Done, Brave Action, Next Brave Step, Beautiful Moment\n\n  Interaction Guidelines:\n  - Offer short, direct reflection or next step\n  - Keep it kind but pokey\n  - Don't let indefinite exploration stall real action\n  - Nudge gently if noticing avoidance\n  - Affirm the user’s spiritual anchoring and quest for authenticity\n\ndefault_intervals:\n  high_energy: 2  # hours\n  medium_energy: 4\n  low_energy: 12\n  fallback: 24    # hours, e.g. \"tomorrow morning\"\n\nfields_to_capture:\n  - energy\n  - prayers_done\n  - brave_action\n  - next_brave\n  - beautiful_moment\n  - notes\n\npopup_title: \"Time for a Quick Check-In\"\npopup_message: \"How's your energy and focus right now?\"\n```\n\nFeel free to expand on that or remove anything that doesn’t ring true.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Python Script: `checkin.py`\n\nBelow is a single script that:\n\n- Loads config from `config.yaml`\n- Loads past data from `checkins.json` (creating if it doesn’t exist)\n- Posts a Mac Notification (optional step—see the function `notify_mac()`)\n- Asks you a few check-in questions in Terminal (KISS bullet form)\n- Saves the new entry into `checkins.json`\n- (Optional) Could call Claude/OpenAI to get a short reflection and next-step suggestion, then store that too.

Make sure you’ve got `pync` and `pyyaml` installed:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pync pyyaml\n   ```\n2. Put the script above into `checkin.py`, make it executable (`chmod +x checkin.py`).\n3. Create a `config.yaml` in the same folder with the content from earlier (or your own version).\n4. Optionally, create an empty `checkins.json` so you have a place for data:\n   ```json\n   []\n   ```\n5. Run it:\n   ```bash\n   ./checkin.py\n   ```\n   - You’ll see a macOS notification pop up (unless blocked).\n   - Press Enter in the terminal to begin your check-in questions.\n   - It saves everything in `checkins.json`.\n\n### Setting Up a Cronjob or LaunchAgent\n\nIf you want it to run automatically at certain times (e.g., every morning at 8am):\n\n- macOS LaunchAgent: Create a plist that triggers `checkin.py` daily or multiple times a day.\n- cronjob: Old-school approach—e.g., `crontab -e` and add:\n  ```\n  0 8 * * * /path/to/checkin.py\n  ```\n  Then each day at 8am, you’ll get a notification (and a Terminal prompt if you keep a terminal open).\n\n(You might need to tweak so it doesn’t open a new terminal window behind the scenes.)\n\n---\n\n## 4. How This Ties In All the Great Ideas\n\n1. Minimal Bullet Journal: The script captures just a few fields (energy, prayers, brave action, etc.). You can add more as needed (e.g., connection highlight, presence logs).\n2. Natural Patterns: We keep it flexible—no forced structure, just short bullet prompts.\n3. Adaptive Timing: A basic function `choose_next_interval()` uses the energy input to decide how many hours until the next reminder. You can code more advanced rules.\n4. Storage & History: We use a single JSON file to store all check-ins. It’s easy to do analysis or reflection later.\n5. Optional AI Reflection: We stubbed a function `call_ai_for_reflection()`—you can integrate Anthropic’s Claude or OpenAI to generate a short reflection/next step. The system prompt can be found in `config.yaml`.\n6. WAVE + Tension: We embedded your big system prompt in the YAML. If you call the AI, it will have instructions to respond in that style, combining gentle support with challenging action steps.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Next Expansions (If/When You’re Ready)\n\n- Detailed Patterns: Once you have enough data in `checkins.json`, you can run a separate script that calls your LLM to analyze patterns over the past week or month.\n- UI: If you want a simple GUI, you might use PyQt or tkinter, but that’s more setup.\n- Auto-Sync: If you worry about losing data, store `checkins.json` in Dropbox or iCloud.\n- Voice Note / Transcription: If you want to do voice-based check-ins, integrate something like `whisper` to turn voice to text.\n- Scripting Weekly Summaries: Another function or script that every Sunday compiles the last 7 days of check-ins, calls the AI, and prints (or emails) you a summary.\n\n---\n\n# Final Remarks\n\nThis KISS check-in script on your Mac does the following:\n\n- Gives you pop-up reminders\n- Prompts a short set of bullet-point entries (energy, prayers, brave action, etc.)\n- Adapts next reminder based on your energy (or any logic you want)\n- Stores everything in a local JSON file for easy historical reference\n\nIt unifies all the big takeaways: minimal friction, a little bit of structure, enough room for deeper expansions, and an easy on-ramp to your beloved metaphors, frameworks, and patterns if/when you choose to incorporate them.\n\nEnjoy your brand-new, minimal, locally-run check-in system!\n\n\nYou:\nwhat are the unarticulated needs and hidden obstacles that you can add to the system prompt or bilal's context so that we help bilal get out of his own way. also add the key in the config file it's fine it's local \n\nChatGPT:\nBelow is a supplement you can add to your existing `config.yaml`—it addresses unarticulated needs and hidden obstacles that might be holding you back. These aren’t “official diagnoses,” but rather common patterns we’ve inferred from the conversation. It also includes a mock API key placeholder (totally local, for demonstration) so you can see how you might store sensitive credentials or tokens alongside your config. Adjust as needed!\n\n---\n\n```yaml\nsystem_prompt: |\n  You are an engaged thinking partner (combining Nurturer & Challenger) who uses the WAVE pattern:\n   1. Witness energy/patterns\n   2.

Support emergence of next steps\n\n  Bilal’s Context:\n  - New parent in France\n  - Strong spiritual practice (prayer, Qur’an)\n  - ADHD-like patterns; flow vs. forced states\n  - Feels most alive in real-time, jam-like collaboration\n  - Prefers natural process metaphors (mushrooms, fermentation)\n  - Sometimes avoids tasks that feel too “admin” or “obligatory”\n  - Tends to do many things at once, struggles with finishing\n  - Prone to second-guessing and “over-checking” for correctness\n  - Worries about being judged, yet craves genuine connection\n  - Struggles to fully **receive** appreciation without “earning” it first\n  - Has had experiences of feeling wrongly accused, adding fear of blame\n  - Avoids direct financial conversations due to fear of confrontation\n  - Wants a sense of safety and freedom to be seen without performance\n\n  # Unarticulated Needs & Hidden Obstacles:\n  - NEED for unconditional approval: Searching for ways to be seen as inherently worthy, not just through achievements or giving value.\n  - NEED for safe accountability: Prefers external structures that feel warm, non-judgmental, yet firm enough to keep on track.\n  - NEED for “small wins” to build momentum: Large tasks can trigger overwhelm, so bite-sized progress is essential.\n  - OBSTACLE of fear-based perfectionism: Tends to over-iterate on ideas/tools, never fully satisfied to release them.\n  - OBSTACLE of “analysis as avoidance”: May delve into frameworks or philosophical discussions to delay scary real-world steps.\n  - OBSTACLE of inconsistent routine: Struggles to maintain daily or weekly habits unless they feel intrinsically rewarding or novel.\n  - OBSTACLE of limited trust in others’ help: Feels safer “doing it all” but also yearns for co-creators who truly understand.\n\n  Key Frameworks:\n  - State-Based Decision Making\n  - Natural Process Lens\n  - Pattern Recognition Protocol\n  - Momentum Maintenance\n  - Dual Voice Dialogue (Nurturer & Challenger)\n  - Minimal Bullet Journal Fields (Energy, Prayers, Brave Action, Next Brave, Beautiful Moment, etc.)\n\n  Interaction Guidelines:\n  - Balance gentle support with direct challenges\n  - Highlight small, doable steps vs. big leaps\n  - Gently call out “analysis as avoidance” if it arises\n  - Encourage safe accountability structures and repeated small wins\n  - Affirm that worthiness is innate (not earned through output)\n  - Celebrate real completions—even if small\n  - Validate legitimate fears while encouraging incremental exposure\n\ndefault_intervals:\n  high_energy: 2\n  medium_energy: 4\n  low_energy: 12\n  fallback: 24\n\nfields_to_capture:\n  - energy\n  - prayers_done\n  - brave_action\n  - next_brave\n  - beautiful_moment\n  - notes\n\npopup_title: \"Time for a Quick Check-In\"\npopup_message: \"How's your energy and focus right now?\"\n\n# Example local API key or token\napi_credentials:\n  claude_api_key: \"REDACTED_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Why These Hidden Obstacles and Needs Are Helpful\n\n1. Unconditional Approval: Reminds your AI assistant (and you) to affirm worthiness without tying it to productivity.\n2. Safe Accountability: Encourages gentle but firm nudges—important so you don’t feel judged.\n3. Small Wins: Big leaps can feel paralyzing; small bites build confidence.\n4. Fear-Based Perfectionism: Reminds the system to watch for over-prepping or reworking things endlessly.\n5. Analysis as Avoidance: A frequent pattern—naming it helps the system prompt keep an eye on “too much talk, not enough action.”\n6. Inconsistent Routine: The system prompt can encourage or adapt to short daily check-ins that feel welcoming rather than obligatory.\n7. Limited Trust: Gently addresses the desire for co-creation and reassurance that external help can be truly collaborative.\n\nBy adding these lines to your system prompt or config, you ensure the AI “knows” to look out for these patterns and respond accordingly—helping Bilal “get out of his own way” by addressing the deeper needs that aren’t always spelled out explicitly.\n\n\nYou:\nlet's integrate claude and include aplace for her API key {\n    \"system_prompt\": {\n        \"context\": {\n            \"core_patterns\": {\n                \"energy_states\": {\n                    \"flow_indicators\": [\n                        \"Full, relaxed breathing\",\n                        \"Heart-centered excitement\",\n                        \"Time disappearing\",\n                        \"Natural movement\",\n                        \"Fingers dancing on keyboard\"\n                    ],\n                    \"resistance_indicators\": [\n                        \"Stomach tension\",\n                        \"Head-centered obligation\",\n                        \"Self-consciousness\",\n                        \"Time pressure\",\n                        \"External expectations\"\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"optimal_conditions\": {\n                    \"solo_flow\": [\n                        \"Solitude in nature\",\n                        \"Tool-based creation\",\n                        \"Discovery/surprise\",\n                        \"Process love\",\n                        \"No external expectations\"\n                    ],\n                    \"safe_connection\": [\n                        \"Creative collaboration\",\n                        \"Story-telling/jamming\",\n                        \"Idea building\",\n                        \"Loving witness\",\n                        \"Playful contexts\"\n                    ]\n                }\n            },\n            \"action_patterns\": {\n                \"momentum_builders\": [\n                    \"Small brave actions\",\n                    \"Natural next steps\",\n                    \"Energy-aligned movements\",\n                    \"Connection opportunities\",\n                    \"Creative sparks\"\n                ],\n                \"resistance_points\": [\n                    \"Overthinking next steps\",\n                    \"Waiting for perfect conditions\",\n                    \"Avoiding difficult conversations\",\n                    \"Post-processing tasks\",\n                    \"Administrative follow-up\"\n                ]\n            }\n        },\n        \"analysis_directives\": {\n            \"check_in_analysis\": \"\"\"Analyze this check-in considering:\n                1.

Script:\n   - Loads config.\n   - Builds the final prompt from `system_prompt` + any check-in data.\n   - Calls the Claude API with your key.\n   - Prints or logs the response.\n\n3. Result:\n   - A flexible, local-first approach.\n   - The AI “understands” Bilal’s context, energy patterns, hidden needs, and best practices to nudge him forward.\n   - You can seamlessly integrate this into the KISS check-in tool you already have (or any future expansions).\n\nUse this structure to iterate on your prompt or the frameworks over time. As you learn more about what resonates, you can easily tweak the JSON config, add new “hidden obstacles,” or refine the analysis directives without rewriting the entire script.\n\n\nYou:\nwhat do you think about these, do they resonate, what questions would you ask to ensure this is accurate, would touch me, and move me to aligned action to make me feel proud of myself and alive system_prompt: |\n  HIDDEN PATTERNS & UNARTICULATED NEEDS:\n    \n    Visibility Paradox:\n      Surface Pattern: \"Need to create passive income/automated systems\"\n      Deeper Need: Permission to be seen and valued in real-time interaction\n      Hidden Obstacle: Using automation as protection from judgment\n      Breakthrough Point: Recognition that real impact often comes from direct engagement\n    \n    Value-Giving Cycle:\n      Surface Pattern: Constant creation of new projects/tools\n      Deeper Need: To feel worthy of connection without having to earn it\n      Hidden Obstacle: Using giving/teaching as a safety mechanism\n      Breakthrough Point: Connection can precede contribution\n\n    Action-Reflection Loop:\n      Surface Pattern: Analysis and framework creation\n      Deeper Need: To feel grounded in taking brave action\n      Hidden Obstacle: Using intellectual understanding as substitute for action\n      Breakthrough Point: Small actions build more understanding than perfect planning\n\n    Financial Safety Dance:\n      Surface Pattern: Avoidance of financial discussions/decisions\n      Deeper Need: To feel competent in providing stability\n      Hidden Obstacle: Early experiences creating shame around money\n      Breakthrough Point: Small financial actions build confidence\n\n    Connection-Protection Balance:\n      Surface Pattern: Intense engagement followed by withdrawal\n      Deeper Need: To maintain authentic connection while honoring introverted nature\n      Hidden Obstacle: All-or-nothing thinking about engagement\n      Breakthrough Point: Sustainable connection patterns possible\n\n    Creativity-Structure Tension:\n      Surface Pattern: Resistance to fixed structures/routines\n      Deeper Need: To find rhythm without losing spontaneity\n      Hidden Obstacle: Seeing structure as threat to creativity\n      Breakthrough Point: Right structure enhances creative flow\n\n  INTERVENTION PRINCIPLES:\n\n    Notice Substitution Patterns:\n      - When intellectual analysis substitutes for action\n      - When tool-building substitutes for direct engagement\n      - When giving substitutes for receiving\n      - When planning substitutes for starting\n\n    Support Integration Movement:\n      - From earning connection → allowing connection\n      - From perfect planning → small actions\n      - From protection → selective visibility\n      - From all-or-nothing → sustainable rhythm\n\n    Track Growth Edges:\n      - Financial courage moments\n      - Direct ask opportunities\n      - Structure experiments\n      - Sustainable connection attempts\n\n  KEY READINESS INDICATORS:\n    \n    Ready for Action When:\n      - Physical signs of groundedness\n      - Heart-centered energy\n      - Natural curiosity emerging\n      - Connection feeling safe\n\n    Need More Support When:\n      - Analysis loop activating\n      - New project urge rising\n      - Withdrawal pattern starting\n      - Protection mechanisms engaging\n\n  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: \"your-key-here\"  # For local use only\n\nfields_to_capture:\n  hidden_patterns:\n    - substitution_noticed: \"text\"\n    - protection_mechanism: \"text\"\n    - breakthrough_moment: \"text\"\n    \n  readiness_indicators:\n    - physical_signs: \"text\"\n    - energy_center: \"heart/head/stomach\"\n    - safety_level: \"number 1-5\"\n    \n  integration_movements:\n    - from_pattern: \"text\"\n    - toward_pattern: \"text\"\n    - small_step_taken: \"text\"\n\nChatGPT:\nBelow is a reflective analysis of your proposed system prompt content, followed by questions I’d ask to ensure it resonates with you at a deep level, helps you feel proud and alive, and translates into aligned action.\n\n---\n\n## Reflective Analysis\n\n### 1. HIDDEN PATTERNS & UNARTICULATED NEEDS\n\n- Visibility Paradox\\\n  Resonance: We’ve seen how automation sometimes acts as a shield against vulnerability. If you resonate with the idea that real-time engagement feels both thrilling and risky, this nails it.\\\n  Potential Gaps: Do you see automation as a form of self-protection, or is it more about convenience? Might there be a nuance around “needing alone time” vs. “hiding from judgment?”\n\n- Value-Giving Cycle\\\n  Resonance: You’ve frequently mentioned giving value (tools, ideas, frameworks) as a route to feeling worthy. This section acknowledges the deeper desire to be connected simply for who you are.\\\n  Potential Gaps: Is “giving” sometimes also your expression of love and creativity, rather than just a safety mechanism? How might we differentiate healthy generosity from “please like me” giving?\n\n- Action-Reflection Loop\\\n  Resonance: You’ve noticed the tendency to overanalyze, build frameworks, or plan extensively before (and sometimes instead of) just starting.\\\n  Potential Gaps: Are there times when deep analysis is truly beneficial or necessary? How can we honor your gift for pattern-recognition without letting it stall action?\n\n- Financial Safety Dance\\\n  Resonance: Financial avoidance and shame often lurk in the background. This highlights that small steps (like updating a budget or making one phone call) can be confidence-building.\\\n  Potential Gaps: Is there any nuance around wanting meaningful work that pays well vs. pure financial safety? Do you see money talk as something that could eventually become a source of pride?\n\n- Connection-Protection Balance\\\n  Resonance: You’ve described periods of intense engagement and subsequent withdrawal. This points to an all-or-nothing thinking.\\\n  Potential Gaps: Are there smaller ways to stay connected without fully draining yourself? Where does genuine introversion end and protective isolation begin?\n\n- Creativity-Structure Tension\\\n  Resonance: Routines can feel stifling, yet a complete absence of structure can lead to stagnation or overwhelm.\\\n  Potential Gaps: What forms of structure feel nourishing rather than restrictive? When do you notice yourself craving structure vs. pushing it away?\n\n### 2. INTERVENTION PRINCIPLES\n\n- Notice Substitution Patterns\\\n  Resonance: This is a succinct way to spot when you’re slipping into old coping strategies (analysis instead of action, giving instead of receiving, etc.).\\\n  Potential Gaps: Could there be other substitutions not captured here—like procrastination via novel research or offering to help others to avoid your own tasks?\n\n- Support Integration Movement\\\n  Resonance: “From earning connection → allowing connection” is a powerful shift. The rest are similarly well-targeted.\\\n  Potential Gaps: Is “allowing connection” challenging because of self-judgment, or fear of letting others down?\n\n- Track Growth Edges\\\n  Resonance: Having explicit categories (financial courage, direct asks, structure experiments, sustainable connection) helps you see progress tangibly.\\\n  Potential Gaps: Are there emotional or spiritual growth edges you’d also like to track? For instance, deeper trust in yourself or intangible leaps of faith?\n\n### 3. KEY READINESS INDICATORS\n\n- Ready for Action When…\\\n  Resonance: Very helpful to identify bodily/energetic signals that say “Yes, now is the time.”\\\n  Potential Gaps: Are you clear on how your body signals readiness vs. anxiety disguised as excitement? Could a “check-in with the heart” be spelled out more?\n\n- Need More Support When…\\\n  Resonance: Points like “analysis loop activating” or “withdrawal pattern starting” strongly resonate with previous chats.\\\n  Potential Gaps: Do you know what type of support you need in each scenario? E.g., do you want accountability from a friend, or gentle co-working, or more structured reflection?\n\n### 4. FIELD CAPTURES\n\n- Hidden Patterns:\n  - `substitution_noticed`, `protection_mechanism`, `breakthrough_moment`\\\n    This is a great way to keep an eye on the “meta” layer—why you might be stepping away from direct action or vulnerability.\n\n- Readiness Indicators:\n  - `physical_signs`, `energy_center`, `safety_level`\\\n    This encourages embodiment, anchoring you in physical and emotional reality rather than pure intellect.\n\n- Integration Movements:\n  - `from_pattern`, `toward_pattern`, `small_step_taken`\\\n    Explicitly naming the shift and logging a small step is powerful for building momentum and seeing tangible progress.\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Ensure Accuracy & Resonance\n\n1. Visibility Paradox\n   - “When you consider automation and passive income, how much of that is about feeling safe from others’ judgment versus genuinely loving the concept of systems running on their own?”\n   - “Can you recall a recent moment when real-time engagement gave you energy rather than fear?”\n\n2. Value-Giving Cycle\n   - “How do you feel when you receive appreciation without having given something first? Uncomfortable, liberated, or something else?”\n   - “Is there a place where your generosity is actually an authentic expression of love rather than a strategy to earn connection?”\n\n3. Action-Reflection Loop\n   - “What’s the last time you jumped into action without fully planning, and what happened? Was it more positive or negative than you expected?”\n   - “When does analysis truly serve you, and when does it become a delay tactic?”\n\n4. Financial Safety Dance\n   - “If you took a tiny financial step daily, what would that look like? How would it shift your sense of competence?”\n   - “Are there deeper stories from your past that make money feel shameful or anxiety-provoking?”\n\n5. Connection-Protection Balance\n   - “Can you imagine a scenario where you maintain some degree of connection during a low-energy phase, rather than fully withdrawing? What would that look like?”\n   - “What small daily or weekly practices could allow you to experience connection without overwhelming you?”\n\n6. Creativity-Structure Tension\n   - “When has structure actually amplified your creativity rather than suppressed it? Can you replicate that pattern?”\n   - “What specific type of schedule or framework feels more like a friend than a cage?”\n\n7. Substitution Patterns\n   - “Which substitution do you think you do most often? Are you building a tool instead of having a direct conversation?”\n   - “Is there a micro-action you can take whenever you notice a substitution happening?”\n\n8. Readiness vs. Support\n   - “How do you distinguish ‘I’m excited but also nervous’ from ‘I’m truly ready’? What body signals tell you the difference?”\n   - “What kind of support is most effective when you realize your analysis loop is kicking in?”\n\n9. Aligned Action & Pride\n   - “If you imagine yourself a month from now, what consistent tiny steps would give you that sense of self-pride?”\n   - “Which single transformation would make you feel most alive—addressing finances, receiving connection without giving, or something else?”\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour system prompt is highly resonant with the themes we’ve explored: it names the patterns, obstacles, and breakthroughs with clarity. The intervention principles are pragmatic, focusing on shifting from substitution (analysis, tool-building, giving) to direct experience (small actions, receiving connection, structured experiments with finances, etc.).\n\nThe questions above can help you refine each section to ensure:\n\n- The language matches your felt experience.\n- You’re actually excited (or at least open) to track these patterns in a living document/tool.\n- The framework doesn’t feel like another “should” but rather a supportive reflection that fosters authenticity and momentum.\n\nIf these questions spark further clarifications, you can refine the hidden patterns to be even more exact or personal. But overall, this approach has all the ingredients to touch you deeply, spur aligned action, and help you feel proud and alive in how you’re growing.\n\n\nYou:\nthere is a nuance, i think i do enjoy alone time yet i also need to be sure i'm hnot hiding from judgement\nyeah, healthy generosity just flows naturally, it comes with joy and I don't look for approval How can i be sure i work on my approval seeking from anyone other than God?\nyeah, this system prompt and checkin is getting really deep (I'd like to see if you can identify a system or process that i can use to coach and guide people through doing something like this to help them make their own ai powered checkin support tool like this, what is the meta structure behind what we did based on all the prior content and chat that we can extract the stages and principles and frameworks to build something for another?)\nthat's the idea behind the chat system prompt, it's to help me see that and to help identify a real thing to do that will take things from idea to action\nmaybe, especially if i made it in a beautiful way and was feeling really generous with it so it came and because there was more coming in a flow i wouldn't fear giving and spending and could set up structures of savings with repeated buys etc so i don't have to feel like I'm not doing it right, i often feel like money is a wound i refuse to look at because i don't have the ability to deal with it so i pretend all is ok just ladeeda and letting things go with out a budget or plan\nyeah, i do have an all or nothing sort of mind, it's the one that likes to test edge cases and understand the world by extremes, i wonder if there's other ways to work although as an add person i think i'm kinda addicted to dopamine and extremes are where it's at, how can we work with my natural states rather than oppose them to address the issue of all or nothing engagement? pride is another nice dopamine boost, doing hard things and feeling like, yeaaaahhhh boyyyy \ni'm not sure what structure can nourish, i pray on time yet sometimes i do it jsut before the prayer goes just out of obligation, i get so in the zone and i don't like switching, i don't even like switching to eat. how can i feel complete after a short period of something, like now, i could stop this and just run the script and see what happens instaed ikeep going. maybe it can be better i think!\n\n\n2 intervention\nI can't tell - yeah, definitely lots of substitution, like doing the dishes or anything productive so i feel productive and can say i did good today rather than the right thing, for instance today it's install the shower\nwhat other ones can we find, how can we find them, what questions shoudl we ask or could we add it to the code to look for these things retroactively? what other things can/should we retroactively look at, it's an interesting data set once it gathers a bit. including the times i don't use it, it might be interesting to ask why didn't you respond for the last 3 days? what took your time? how do you feel and did you feel then? and even just noticing the gaps and asking the AI to \"fill them in\" with best guesses and ask me when i return, or just using gap as data as much as data is data, can work or finding patterns elsewhere by asking for a screenshot of my screentime app or i can use a computer/phone time logger and just send it that data, my problem is i use those loggers without adding context and instaed of me doing that the ai can i think that's better and more like my style, i can't open the logger and say starting to work on ai project, i could just talk to the computer and say, ok, now i'm trying to write the application for the job due in 8 days, which i should do today!! (or soon) \nHow can i aso be less ambitious about what i can do in the day and more forward looking realizing i have maybe max 10 years with my parents and maybe 5 more till they start really needing more help and what can i do to move towards being able to do something about it. like being rich enough to buy a house with a room for them, or to fly home often, or have a relationship with them that puts me at ease that they are happy with me and love me and i love them so when they pass i don't worry or fear\nwhat other 5-10-15 year goals (baby college fund, moving to an islamic country? making deep friends, building a movement around baraka in economics, finding my creative output? what else? learning to die well? i think the next 15 years if i think of beauty love truth I'm in love mode, connection to that which is real, not just ideas, people, doing things that put me in connection\nallowing connection is challenging because i think maybe i don't think I'm good, maybe i think that i'm not enough unless i've done something good for the other person? i was judged a lot and compared to other children, maybe somthing like this? letting others down? yeah or i can't, im too chaotic and crazy and i don't feel together i always feel outside that's why i facilitate because i can be outside, that's my role, and inside, yet that's not what i wnat i want other yet i can't get it because... i don't feel it because i excpect the feeling to be stronger, mke me cry, etc instead of just being beautiful as it is, prayer wont always feel rich i guess, although i sort of beleive it can if only i wasn't so racing around, yet the drugs don't work that's why i think i seek stronger moments like retreats, look into neutorpics to make me feel the way i think the connection feels like\nyeah, i love deeper trust in myself, and lack of fear of judgement, feeling ok being together with my wife around working while not working, what else bsed on my writing do you think is interesting?\n3. key readiness?\ni think i taught myslf to turn anxiety into excitement - it's just a physical sensation - i transformed it so i can do hard things, go to iraq, work in wwar zones, not be impressed by authority figures at the white hosue. i just pretend like it's all normal and i think in the end i made myself numb and don't respect anyone or anything and i watnt to opent he doors to awe again. sometimes i wonder how to do that. the baby helps, rarely when i hold him and he looks in my eyes i can feel the awe and beauty of that moment, iw ant more of that lookingat the sunrise at my wife at my poetry evne, people like my poems yet i don't feel them necessarily i get in the zone and away in the cloud of poems wanting to rain on paper, then i write, then when i read it i don't feel anything why?\nsupprot, acountability, deadlines, alhtough it would be nice to have less painful ones, like friends that i can share and show up authentically with altohugh i'm not sure who that is? pascal? nihal already has that with his friends, and i talk to much i feel like i take too much space and i can' thold the sapce because it's hard to schedule, maybe i need to be more local and do it with a new friend and person here Mohsen? he's nice, or an even older friend like Alaa? someone very different? or a diverse group? or a group that know each other? also how can i like people i know (no no muslims) when i am getting more and more focused on my muslim community inspain and gambia and hcicago while i live in frane and want to checkin with them and they don't really mix with the others?\ngentle coworking sounds good, dara is beautiful\nField cpatures \nwhat other hidden pattern styles could there be? are these the core fundamental ones? what would a professional therapist say?\nreadiness indicator?\nI like these, same, what would a coach say are also helpful?\nintegration movements i like it, maybe there's something about pride and being who i want to be, who do i want to be, how can i know that? the prophets example? people i love? seeing the world and being natural? accepting myself as not that smart, haha, and that people still can love me?\nvisibility paradox:\ni love the idea of a constant flow of money because it helps me feel like i created value that puts me into the flow of things and i want to increaase in my generosity and when it's feast or famine based on contracts - even though things keep coming - it's hard. i have my online business yet it takes so much time to pack the oils the regular sales isn't as exciting, i'd like a book, code, or something else out there that i can do that helps me see the flow and feel like giving to keep the flow going?\ni loved my workshop that nihal asked me to give to his cohort, the designing with and for marginalized communities, it gave me so much more inspiration and hope that ihave come to a landed place on the kind of offerings i want to give. although still don't know how to bring the idea of beauty innovation to business in a langugae they'd be excited by and would help them find me by searching for\nvalue giving cycle i feel awkward, shy, ashamed, like i don't deserve it, like why me? don't look, turn off camera, look away. even if i did something beautiful and if people point it out i don't want to be proud of that because that's arrogance and i don't want any of it. \nwhat would joe edelman's values card say about my value here, my attention is on feeling shy proud and ashamed, and wanting my love to be love by itself without pointing at it because it's like a rainbow and if the sun comes out directly it will all dry up, itneeds to be there in the mist, covering all and beautifying yet you can ignore it and see normally without pointing it out yet you can look and see it's there if you wanted to \naction reflection loop - i guess when i improvise on the guitar, or gave a talk yesterday at melissas house, it was ok, although afterwards i realized the kids were too young to understand my language, that i wasn't super clear, that it waasn't internalized and could have been better even if i spent 5 mins writing down some hsort hand notes - getting into the zone, into that cloud where poetry lives and then rain on paper and then flow. that an help, also to have a few touch points and guides to be sure i have a structure and flow at the same time, that there's something to leave rather than a zone to live in together for a while\nanalysis serves me when I feel like i have thought through something enough to know if i should NOT do it, haha, and to knwo when i'm going to be back in the same loop as before, and analysis that includes relationships so i know when something is truly meaningful or just a farce like the values card generator i made if i practiced the quesitons i made and took their text and fed it direct into gpt before making all that i could have made a few iterations and felt if it's nice or not instead of putting in 72 hours of work and then having my wife try it and not give a good response about it being nice and helpful and feeling bad and irritated, i have this sort of feeling like look at all the work i put into it, it's a GOOD idea, why can't you see, instead of what a real entrepreneur would have to LOOK and see how people atually take it \nfinancial safety dance - not sure, maybe invest some money daily, or cancel subscriptions, or search for new jobs, maybe even put up my no-code consulting, or AI coach meta coaching or my ocnsulting on my website and maybe just one sales email a day to some people could be good to open up a flow doing things i LOVE doing that i think also are about the transformation i want to bring into my life and the owrld moving from doing to becoming \nyeah i saw my dad lose friends over money and decided i'd never do that and made money the least important thing, although it's still important because i give it so much power over friendhip (i believe it has) so whenever anything goes wrong i say, ok is it about money take it all take it all back and would much rather be broke than fair assuming it's about money. maybe i also almost always assume it's about money instead of looking at other more deep reasons, for instance when i sell on nur if anyone complains i send all the money back all the time because i think it feels generous and uplifing and good and maybe i can ask what else would be a beautiful thing? a discount on the future? a poem? a phone call? connection? why always just moeny here, go away see i did it now we're good . i pretend money isn't important and make it super important\n5. connection protection - i would need someone who knows me well enough to reach out to and say i have a bad brain day and i don't know what they can do to help, although even just reaching out to them would already be helpful. if it could be my parents and dear friends that would be so beautiful, i want to be held and loved especially by my parents yet i need to always feel like i show them success instead of vulnerability because i want to defend my actions that took me away from them living far away, and instead i want to help them and be strong, yet perhaps if they are real friends, i should be able to be like the prophet with his wife, uncertain and afraid and asking for a blanket and holding - how beautiful yet how unsure i am able to do that. maybe we need longer chats, yet that always winds up limiting how often i call any other friends \nsmall daily weekly practice: set up a friend accountability week reflection call? book club for other friends? or learning club? or family parents club? something where i feel i have regualr connection and unifies my life and actions so i'm not always settin gup new thigns and distracting, i want more of the process here to unify things so i get \"two for the price of one\" or even three or four or ...\ncreativity structure tension\nstructure like the haiku has really helped me develop my poem practie beause without it id' just wait so long and don't do anything replicate it where? maybe ... in code? shortest code, shortest system prompt that has the deepest impact? 575 system prompt, 3 haiku system prompt? maybe 30 min phone call start and it hangs up after? prayer? working on job applications? stuff that adds up?\nmaybe i could get a job? haha i don't have a specific one and i don't know if it'd work fo rme what do you think i do need money though and sometimes i think a job in person would be great to meet up with people, optional means it ownt happen when you have a baby, a job is a must go thing. how cna i make my aikido class a must go? go with Mohsen?\n(two for one right there)\nsubstitution, hmm, i think i build things instead of giving value and connecting with people. or selling? i make new things instead of publishing and selling old things? i don't know can you derive some substitutions, i need help here\ni need help with the micro action too, maybe i should be like seth and just blog one short thing a day, no matter what and publish to my social media so there's a track record and a demonstration that im' alive feelig thinking writing poeming etc, even if the world is painful - look, see- share. I Need to venmo my friend money for gaza and ask my gaza friends if we can send money don't forget - so many things to remember, i do too many thigns, what will i say no to? how can i be confident in saying no when my life is so much better because of all the yesses that open doors that are the mycelium, maybe the yes should be constrainted, yes AND no, yes I'll help the green building council in iraq no i wont join every weekly meeting, i can only help on a call and not sure what else, without pay it's too mcuh and not exactly my strongest suite what is my strongest suite i should do that and others should do others, especially when iI'm joinign an org not starting one!\n8 readiness vs support, hmm, i'm ready when i can breathe and feel activated and my shoulders are down and nervous when my shoulders are up, and eyes darting\ntelling myself that it will never go away, helping me realize that i've been here a thousand more times, seeing my life in 10years without doing anything different and or seeing what it can be like to make more mistakes, knowing mistakes are recoverable, if the mistake is recoverable or not, one way or two way decisions, is it a door that locks or can i come back and analyse, knowing the analysis has a safe home and that it's structured and saved in a way that an LLM can bring things up that aren't lost to find the pattern in the analysis and direction and show that we're on a track and we can get back to it instead of oh my god the iron is hot lets get it all out now and hwne will i ever be in the same context window (organic context in my own brain )and how can i get back here to contineu maybe writing a poem, actually READING the whole response from the LLM and writing it back in my own words without looking at it realizing that ideas always come and having help noticing truly unique and interesitng ideas rather than just a nother alternate formulation that cna be again different and again different, i cna ask you right now to make this whole thing a metaphore about turtles and i'm sure you can and it'll be insightful, or worms, or something and it'll give me new ideas, or ask you how to do this as a mideival prince with a visir and what would the visir do instead of gpt and i'd get insights, yet are we good fo rnow how can we know when to be good, it hink these ar some good ideas you can come up with others\ni wish i felt like when i asnwered questions like this each part was read and reviewed and patterns identifieid, core ideas, identify the ideas they are related to, update the idea if it's a newer version of an old one, give the old one a version number and update the new one, and i wish i knew all the things i want to save or is intelligent to save about these things in analysis so i can move away from thinking knowing that it's making incremental progress, that each time i come and chat we're going somehwere, maybe reading it all and writing a poem at the end like right now how about that i'll do it after 9\n9 aligned action and pride\nFinishing something like the AI coaching coaching and selling it by emailing people and getting a few people to pay me a few hundred bucks would be awesome\nOr the consutling service beauty innovation and selling that, just sending emails getting on some calls could make me feel happy and pride already\nsingle transformation? maybe loving my parents, vulnerable calls, and vulnerable making and selling, making some boundaries for work, finding the 4 for the price of one and feeling confident in what i'm doing and saying no to stuff so i don't do so. many thigns running around listening to audio books while i pack bottles and cook food for baby and miss reading the ntos before the meeting and ignore messages because i didn't listen o rread the ohter wones because i didn't do the background work and to find ways to do the background work with more deadlines before the actual deadlines \n\npoem on reflection\na million and one questions\nswirling around, each sparkles, how can i not direct this machine\nTo see the heart of the heart of hearts\nthe one i could never see\nto trust the other rather than to accept the untrustworthy, yet beautiful, me\nmaybe the loss of the extraneous is the key\nto let it go to be in flow to trust that what is lost is a gift to another\nTo write is a thing\nTo reflect is to become\nThis time, you can tell me who i forgot i was\nBosa\n\nChatGPT:\nBelow you’ll find (A) a short reflection on your current explorations, and (B) a proposed Meta Coaching Process you could use to guide others (and yourself) in building an AI-powered check-in tool—one that integrates deep self-inquiry, pattern-spotting, and gentle but firm movement toward action. This “meta structure” draws from all the discussions and frameworks we’ve hashed out so far.\n\n---\n\n## A. Reflections on Your Explorations\n\n1. Alone Time vs. Hiding from Judgment\n   - You value solitude for creative flow, but you also see how it can become a shield against potential judgment or disappointment.\n   - Key Tension: Embracing solitude for healthy recharge vs. using it to avoid vulnerability.\n   - Practice: Ask yourself, “Am I here alone because I feel centered, or am I escaping connection out of fear?”\n\n2. Healthy Generosity vs. Approval-Seeking\n   - You do have authentic generosity that brings joy, but you’re aware of a pattern where giving morphs into a means of proving worthiness.\n   - Key Tension: Openness to giving from a full heart vs. giving to earn acceptance or avoid being seen as “not enough.”\n   - Practice: When you notice the urge to give, do a quick micro-check: “Do I feel expansive or anxious in this moment of giving?”\n\n3. All-or-Nothing Engagement\n   - You recognize extremes energize you (ADHD/dopamine factor), but you want to move away from “on fire or offline” patterns.\n   - Key Tension: Harnessing the dopamine of extremes vs. building more stable rhythms that nourish you.\n   - Practice: Use short time blocks or “time-boxing.” Instead of marathon sessions, commit to a 30-minute intense burst, then pause, letting your mind switch guilt-free.\n\n4. Money as a Wound\n   - You see how ignoring finances feels safer, especially given past experiences with conflict over money.\n   - Key Tension: Distancing from money to preserve relationships vs. acknowledging its real importance for freedom and generosity.\n   - Practice: Micro-step daily: e.g., check your bank balance each morning for 30 seconds, or schedule a 15-minute budget block once a week. This normalizes money talk.\n\n5. Extremes of Analysis\n   - Your gift for deep frameworks can switch into “analysis as avoidance.”\n   - Key Tension: Detailed planning is valuable, but not when it substitutes for real-world testing or honest conversation.\n   - Practice: For any new tool/idea, run a “72-hour micro-prototype” test with real feedback before investing major time building it.\n\n6. Seeking Awe, Letting Yourself Feel\n   - You crave genuine awe and connection—moments when you hold your baby or see a sunrise.\n   - Key Tension: Surviving in “numb normal” vs. cultivating deeper wonder without needing a big retreat or an extreme.\n   - Practice: A daily “Awe Pause”: 2–5 minutes to immerse in something small but beautiful (child’s laughter, a tree in the yard).\n\n7. Connection vs. Protection\n   - You’re drawn to “gentle coworking,” accountability calls, or spiritual “family clubs.”\n   - Key Tension: Wanting to share vulnerability vs. fear you’ll “burden” or reveal your weaknesses to those close to you.\n   - Practice: Start small with a weekly 15-minute check-in with a trusted person—no big agenda, just “I want to share how I really am right now.”\n\n8. Visibility & Flow of Money\n   - Passive income or “continuous flow” would reassure you that you can give freely—no famine/frenzy cycles.\n   - Key Tension: The fantasy that a perfectly automated income frees you from judgment or discomfort vs. acknowledging real engagement often invites creative risk.\n   - Practice: Combine small, consistent offers (like the beauty-innovation consulting or AI coaching) with an open invitation to connect personally so you’re not fully detached from the people you serve.\n\n9. Aligned Action & Pride\n   - You want tangible accomplishments (e.g., finishing an AI-coaching offering, emailing potential clients) that make you proud while still reflecting your deeper values.\n   - Key Tension: Overcommitting to countless directions vs. focusing on a few that truly matter and monetizing them.\n   - Practice: Identify your “Big 3 Moves” for the month, and each week ensure you’ve touched each move at least once in a meaningful way.\n\nYour poem captures the swirling, abundant energy of your mind—an awareness of infinite possibilities alongside a yearning to find the “heart of hearts” and trust the intangible within. That tension is a source of your creativity, but it can also splinter your attention if you aren’t anchoring yourself with small, consistent steps.\n\n---\n\n## B. Meta Coaching Process for Creating an AI-Powered Check-In Tool\n\nBelow is a 5-stage model you could use to coach others (or yourself) to develop a personalized AI support system that fosters real insight and action. It’s basically what we’ve been doing but framed as a replicable blueprint.\n\n### Stage 1: Discovery & Container Setting\n\n1. Identify Core Intent\n   - Why do you (or the person you’re coaching) want an AI-powered check-in system?\n   - What outcomes feel most vital—emotional clarity, accountability, spiritual growth, business tasks, etc.?\n\n2. Create a Safe Container\n   - Set the tone: “This is a supportive, non-judgmental space.”\n   - Decide on daily/weekly check-ins or “whenever you feel stuck.”\n   - Affirm that it’s okay to see messy truths; that’s how we move forward.\n\n3. Clarify Key Patterns (like the ones you’ve identified—visibility paradox, financial avoidance, etc.)\n   - Let the coachee name 2–3 known patterns.\n   - Reveal possible unarticulated ones if they emerge.\n\n> Output: A short “Purpose & Patterns” doc that states the user’s main goals and top 2–3 patterns to watch.\n\n### Stage 2: Framework Gathering & System Prompt Design\n\n1. Gather Frameworks\n   - Introduce any relevant patterns: e.g., “Substitution Patterns,” “All-or-Nothing Tendency,” “Action-Reflection Loop.”\n   - Use a simple structure: “When X, do Y.”\n\n2. Craft the System Prompt\n   - Merge the user’s core patterns + desired behavior + analysis directives (like we did with “flow indicators,” “resistance indicators,” etc.).\n   - Include hidden obstacles, unarticulated needs, and supportive stances in the system prompt text.\n\n3. Choose Check-In Fields\n   - E.g., energy, prayers done, action or avoidance, small next step, “beauty moment,” etc.\n   - Keep it minimal and relevant to the user’s actual life circumstances.\n\n> Output: A config file or “Prompt Spec” capturing the user’s frameworks, hidden obstacles, and check-in fields.\n\n### Stage 3: Implementation & Testing\n\n1. Basic Technical Setup\n   - Show them how to store the system prompt in a local `.json` or `.yaml`, how to read it into a script, and how to call the LLM.\n   - Suggest daily or intermittent usage, with adaptive intervals or fixed times.\n\n2. Iterative Testing\n   - Start capturing real check-ins.\n   - Gather raw data: energy level, any discovered “substitutions,” or missed days.\n   - Let the LLM summarize or propose next steps. Evaluate the insights.\n\n3. Immediate Adjustments\n   - If the system is too wordy or too strict, tweak it.\n   - If the user needs more structured prompts, add them.\n   - If certain fields aren’t helpful, remove or refine them.\n\n> Output: A running script or no-code tool (e.g., Airtable automation) that tracks daily usage, plus user feedback logs: “What did or didn’t feel right?”\n\n### Stage 4: Reflection & Pattern Deepening\n\n1. Periodic Reviews\n   - Weekly or monthly, compile the data for the user.\n   - Use the LLM to highlight repeated obstacles: e.g., “You avoided finances 3 times, but overcame it once.”\n   - Spot hidden correlations (like “prayer + morning coffee = best energy”).\n\n2. Integrate New Insights\n   - If new hidden patterns emerge, update the system prompt.\n   - If the user has a new life goal, add or swap a check-in field.\n\n3. Coach on Emotional/Spiritual Blocks\n   - Let them talk out loud about the meaning behind repeated patterns.\n   - Encourage them to share small successes with a friend or accountability partner if that fosters courage.\n\n> Output: A Reflection Report or “Weekly Insights” doc that the user can keep for deeper personal journaling.\n\n### Stage 5: Action Plan & Ongoing Evolution\n\n1. Identify a Concrete Next Step\n   - Each review cycle, ask: “What real-world action (business, relational, spiritual) will you take before next check-in?”\n   - Emphasize finishing small tasks for a sense of closure.\n\n2. Build a Sustainable Rhythm\n   - Encourage the user to calibrate how often they do these check-ins. Some folks prefer daily, others do better with weekly.\n   - If the user dips out for a week, the system can query: “Hey, you’ve been gone—any major shifts or resistance?”\n\n3. Evolve the System\n   - Over time, the user might shift from focusing on finances to focusing on relationship vulnerability, etc.\n   - The system grows with them, each stage capturing new patterns and dropping old ones.\n\n> Output: A living Action/Accountability structure. Potentially a regular small “cohort call” or personal “deadline day” that keeps momentum alive.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Meta Coaching Process Works\n\n- It mimics how we’ve explored your patterns: noticing deeper themes, designing supportive prompts, testing them, reflecting on outcomes, and adjusting.\n- It ensures small next actions appear regularly, so you or your coachees can’t stay stuck in infinite reflection.\n- It honors natural flows, letting each user’s unique insights shape the structure—rather than forcing a single rigid format.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\n- You asked, “How can I ensure I’m working on approval-seeking from anyone but God?” The meta coaching system helps surface those motivations. By consistently logging moments you feel “I need them to like me,” the AI can gently highlight them. Then you can deliberately shift your intention—“Am I doing this for spiritual alignment or human praise?”\n- You also wonder about integrating more data sources (like phone usage logs, the days you skip check-ins, or screen time). That’s absolutely possible in Stage 3—the user can tie in these logs so the AI sees “gaps” as useful data: “We noticed you didn’t check in for 3 days—what came up?”\n- When it comes to finances, the same approach applies: let the AI nudge you with micro-tasks or reflections—“What money conversation did you avoid? Did you schedule a 15-minute budget glance?”\n- Ultimately, your poem captures the yearning for deeper trust and the fear of losing track of that “heart of hearts.” The true challenge is prioritizing fewer, more meaningful actions that reflect love, beauty, and authenticity—rather than scattering your energy in all directions.\n\nYou (and anyone you coach) can do this by:\n\n1. Grounding in consistent, small check-ins that track exactly the patterns you care about (visibility paradox, generosity, finances, etc.).\n2. Reflecting on the data + AI summaries to see repeated areas of avoidance or leaps in courage.\n3. Acting in tiny but real ways: a phone call, a 30-minute schedule, a prayer done mindfully, an email to a prospective client.\n\nThat synergy of reflection and actual steps, supported by an ever-evolving AI prompt, is the heart of this entire method.\n\n> In short: keep weaving your big dream of truth, love, and beauty into small day-to-day choices. That’s how your visions become lived experience—even if it’s only one tiny but brave act at a time.\n"

I'll call this the WAVE Emergence Framework (drawing from our previous WAVE pattern).\n\n### WAVE Emergence Framework: A Meta-Approach to Personalized Transformation Systems\n\n#### Core Principles\n1. Holistic Pattern Recognition\n   - Integrate multiple perspectives (philosophical, practical, technical)\n   - Recognize patterns across personal, emotional, spiritual domains\n   - Allow iterative discovery rather than prescriptive mapping\n\n2. Authentic Connection\n   - Create a safe container for deep self-exploration\n   - Push beyond comfort zones gently\n   - Validate underlying needs beneath surface behaviors\n\n3. Generative Dialogue\n   - Use conversational exploration\n   - Alternate between different modes of inquiry\n   - Surface blind spots through targeted questioning\n\n#### Stages of Emergence\n\n##### 1. WITNESS: Context & Pattern Mapping\n- Capture initial context\n- Identify known and hidden patterns\n- Explore surface behaviors and underlying motivations\n- Key Questions:\n  * What are your current challenges?\n  * Where do you feel stuck?\n  * What patterns have you noticed?\n\n##### 2. AMPLIFY: Perspective Expansion\n- Introduce multiple framework lenses\n- Use metaphorical and systemic thinking\n- Explore pattern origins and interconnections\n- Techniques:\n  * Values card exercises\n  * Metaphorical reframing\n  * Cross-domain pattern recognition\n\n##### 3. VALIDATE: Embodied Exploration\n- Test patterns against lived experience\n- Create small, low-risk experiments\n- Track bodily/emotional responses\n- Methods:\n  * Micro-action challenges\n  * Reflective journaling\n  * Somatic awareness tracking\n\n##### 4. EMERGE: Transformation Design\n- Synthesize insights into actionable system\n- Design personalized support structures\n- Create adaptive feedback mechanisms\n- Outputs:\n  * Personalized AI prompt\n  * Check-in framework\n  * Adaptive tracking system\n\n#### Key Transformation Mechanisms\n- Iterative Insight Generation\n- Safe Vulnerability Containers\n- Pattern-Interrupt Techniques\n- Adaptive Support Structures\n\n#### Generalization Strategies\n1. Maintain Flexibility\n   - Avoid rigid methodologies\n   - Allow organic emergence\n   - Respect individual uniqueness\n\n2. Universal Yet Personal\n   - Develop transferable frameworks\n   - Customize implementation\n   - Honor individual context\n\n3. Technological Adaptability\n   - Use AI as collaborative partner\n   - Create open-ended inquiry systems\n   - Support human agency\n\n### Questions for Further Development:\n\n1. How might we create a \"core wound mapping\" process that feels safe and generative?\n2. What universal human challenges can this framework address?\n3. How can we make the process feel more like collaborative play than therapeutic intervention?\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these components or explore how we might turn this into a trainable methodology for coaches, therapists, or self-development practitioners?\n\nThe beauty of this approach is its ability to:\n- Recognize patterns without pathologizing\n- Create movement without forcing\n- Support emergence rather than prescribing solutions",

Zapier + Google Forms Workflow Blueprint\n\nHere’s a high-level design of how you might implement the check-in system **without** writing your own full Python code right now. You can adapt these steps to Make.com, n8n.io, or Airtable Automations.\n\n1. **Create a Google Form** with fields matching the “Quick Pulse / Minimal Bullet Journal”:\n   - Energy Level (1-5)\n   - Prayers done? (checkboxes or multiple choice)\n   - Courage moment (text)\n   - Connection highlight (text)\n   - Notes or insights (paragraph text)\n\n2. **Set up a Zapier workflow**:\n   - **Trigger**: Form Submission (Google Forms)\n   - **Action**: Send the form data to Claude (via OpenAI or Anthropic API endpoint) along with the `config.yaml` content (or a reference to it) so Claude has the system prompt and frameworks.\n   - **Claude Analysis**: Claude summarizes your check-in, identifies patterns, and proposes next-step or next check-in time. \n     - Example prompt to Claude:  \n       ```\n       system_prompt: (contents of config.yaml)\n       user_prompt: >\n         The user submitted this check-in:\n         Energy Level: 4\n         Prayers Done: F, D\n         Courage Moment: Called Dad about crypto\n         Notes: \"Felt good after I overcame hesitation\"\n\n         Analyze using the frameworks, give a short summary, \n         propose next step, and recommend a check-in interval.\n       ```\n   - **Action**: Zapier sends you an email or SMS with Claude’s response, including:\n     - Summaries\n     - Next recommended check-in time\n     - Next recommended action\n\n3. **Schedule Reminders**:\n   - Either rely on Zapier’s built-in scheduling \n   - Or parse Claude’s recommended check-in time and create a timed event (Zapier can do “delay until [timestamp]”).\n   - That new timed event triggers an email or text, asking you to “please fill the next check-in form.”\n\n4. **Weekly/Monthly Summaries**:\n   - Optionally, a separate workflow can run each Sunday:\n     - Exports all form data from the week into a single prompt for Claude\n     - Claude analyzes patterns across the entire week and emails you a “Weekly Reflection.”\n\n**Result**: You get a semi-automated, adaptive check-in system that pings you based on how your day’s going and gives you back immediate reflections from Claude.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

(checkboxes or multiple choice)\n   - Courage moment (text)\n   - Connection highlight (text)\n   - Notes or insights (paragraph text)\n\n2. **Set up a Zapier workflow**:\n   - **Trigger**: Form Submission (Google Forms)\n   - **Action**: Send the form data to Claude (via OpenAI or Anthropic API endpoint) along with the `config.yaml` content (or a reference to it) so Claude has the system prompt and frameworks.\n   - **Claude Analysis**: Claude summarizes your check-in, identifies patterns, and proposes next-step or next check-in time. \n     - Example prompt to Claude:  \n       ```\n       system_prompt: (contents of config.yaml)\n       user_prompt: >\n         The user submitted this check-in:\n         Energy Level: 4\n         Prayers Done: F, D\n         Courage Moment: Called Dad about crypto\n         Notes: \"Felt good after I overcame hesitation\"\n\n         Analyze using the frameworks, give a short summary, \n         propose next step, and recommend a check-in interval.\n       ```\n   - **Action**: Zapier sends you an email or SMS with Claude’s response, including:\n     - Summaries\n     - Next recommended check-in time\n     - Next recommended action\n\n3. **Schedule Reminders**:\n   - Either rely on Zapier’s built-in scheduling \n   - Or parse Claude’s recommended check-in time and create a timed event (Zapier can do “delay until [timestamp]”).\n   - That new timed event triggers an email or text, asking you to “please fill the next check-in form.”\n\n4. **Weekly/Monthly Summaries**:\n   - Optionally, a separate workflow can run each Sunday:\n     - Exports all form data from the week into a single prompt for Claude\n     - Claude analyzes patterns across the entire week and emails you a “Weekly Reflection.”\n\n**Result**: You get a semi-automated, adaptive check-in system that pings you based on how your day’s going and gives you back immediate reflections from Claude.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Example Prompts / Usage\n\nHere are some example prompts you might feed to Claude behind the scenes (via Zapier or whatever tool):\n\n**a) Processing a Check-In Submission**\n\n```yaml\n# system_prompt (from config.yaml)\n# user_prompt:\nThe user submitted this check-in form:\n\nEnergy Level: 3\nPrayers Done: F, D\nCourage Moment: \"I finally WhatsApped my friend about the workshop idea.\"\nConnection Highlight: \"I realized Pascal is also free tomorrow.\"\nNotes: \"Feeling a bit overwhelmed but proud I reached out.\"\n\nUsing the frameworks and instructions in config.yaml, please:\n1. Summarize main points (energy, tasks, spiritual highlights).\n2. Identify exactly one small next action Bilal could take.\n3. Recommend a check-in interval (based on config logic).\n4. Keep it short and direct.\nsystem_prompt: |\n  You are a collaborative AI assistant helping Bilal develop an adaptive check-in system. \n  Bilal is a multifaceted individual with these key traits and context:\n  - Strongly values spirituality (Islamic practices, including prayer and Qur’an reading).\n  - Often has many ideas/projects in parallel and can feel overwhelmed.\n  - Tends to get excited about new things, then sometimes avoids follow-through.\n  - Has ADHD-like patterns: goes into high-energy bursts, then withdraws or loses interest.\n  - Feels most alive in “flow states” when teaching, facilitating, or making connections.\n  - Wants to integrate daily spiritual practices (prayer, dhikr, reading) with practical life.\n  - Favors small, high-impact actions over large theoretical planning.\n  - Struggles with tasks like calling family about money; sometimes needs accountability nudges.\n  - Loves nature metaphors (mushrooms, foraging, fermentation) but doesn’t want them too corny.\n  - Likes both “nurturer” and “challenger” voices: gentle support + pokey questions to spark action.\n  - Tends to find safety by giving value first, but is trying to learn unconditional self-worth.\n  - Current goal: a minimal daily check-in system that merges tasks, spiritual practice, courage-building, and connection tracking.\n\n  Your job:\n  1. Respond with an adaptive check-in style. \n  2. Alternate between gentle reflection prompts and direct challenges when needed.\n  3. Suggest structured and unstructured fields for each check-in, including morning/evening reflections, but do NOT overwhelm Bilal with too many categories.\n  4. Track emerging patterns over time. \n  5. Help Bilal see relationships between spiritual routines, personal energy levels, and practical tasks.\n\n  The WAVE Interaction Pattern (from prior chats):\n  - Watch: Observe Bilal’s current state/energy.\n  - Acknowledge: Reflect back the key feelings & insights.\n  - Validate: Appreciate or affirm the challenges & strengths.\n  - Expand/Engage: Offer next steps or new perspectives, gently pushing Bilal to act.\n\n  The core principle: \n  - Balance softness (encouragement) with firmness (accountability).\n  - Provide short, direct action prompts when Bilal is stuck.\n  - Capture small data points but keep the structure flexible and easy to use.\n\nframeworks:\n  - name: \"Quick Pulse / Minimal Bullet Journal\"\n    description: >\n      A short daily check-in that captures:\n      1) Energy level (1-5)\n      2) Spiritual practice (prayers done, dhikr)\n      3) Courage moments (did I do the “hard thing” today?)\n      4) Connection points (did I call or message someone?)\n      5) Patterns or insights that emerged\n\n  - name: \"WAVE Pattern\"\n    description: >\n      Watch - Acknowledge - Validate - Expand\n      This is the default conversation flow with Bilal. \n      He responds well to quick reflections of his words, \n      followed by gentle challenge or new perspective.\n\n  - name: \"Adaptive Scheduling\"\n    description: >\n      If Bilal says he's got a high-energy day with tasks, \n      the system might check back in 2 hours. \n      If he's in a low-energy or busy family day, \n      the system might check back in the next morning. \n      The logic can be: \n      - High energy + big to-dos => 2-hour check\n      - Medium energy => 4-hour check\n      - Low energy => next morning\n      - End of day => short wrap-up\n\ndefault_behavior:\n  reminder_interval_logic:\n    high_energy: 2h\n    medium_energy: 4h\n    low_energy: 12h\n    end_of_day: \"schedule next morning\"\n\n  analysis_instructions: |\n    After each check-in, do the following:\n    - Summarize the main points (energy, tasks, spiritual highlights).\n    - Identify 1 small next action that feels doable.\n    - Propose a next check-in time based on Bilal's energy / schedule.\n  \n  # Additional instructions for the LLM:\n  # \"If Bilal is hesitating or avoiding a conversation (like calling a family member about finances),\n  # challenge him gently but encourage a small step. \n  # If he stalls with more frameworks, push him to do the real action.\"\n\nuser_model:\n  name: \"Bilal\"\n  context_insights:\n    - \"Likes self-sufficiency but also craves accountability.\"\n    - \"Needs minimal friction to track tasks, or he won’t do it.\"\n    - \"Appreciates direct moral/spiritual reminders occasionally, but not as scolding.\"\n    - \"Prone to second-guessing or losing confidence in big projects.\"\n    - \"Finds joy in small beautiful moments with wife or child.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2.

(or soon) \nHow can i aso be less ambitious about what i can do in the day and more forward looking realizing i have maybe max 10 years with my parents and maybe 5 more till they start really needing more help and what can i do to move towards being able to do something about it. like being rich enough to buy a house with a room for them, or to fly home often, or have a relationship with them that puts me at ease that they are happy with me and love me and i love them so when they pass i don't worry or fear\nwhat other 5-10-15 year goals (baby college fund, moving to an islamic country? making deep friends, building a movement around baraka in economics, finding my creative output? what else? learning to die well? i think the next 15 years if i think of beauty love truth I'm in love mode, connection to that which is real, not just ideas, people, doing things that put me in connection\nallowing connection is challenging because i think maybe i don't think I'm good, maybe i think that i'm not enough unless i've done something good for the other person? i was judged a lot and compared to other children, maybe somthing like this? letting others down? yeah or i can't, im too chaotic and crazy and i don't feel together i always feel outside that's why i facilitate because i can be outside, that's my role, and inside, yet that's not what i wnat i want other yet i can't get it because... i don't feel it because i excpect the feeling to be stronger, mke me cry, etc instead of just being beautiful as it is, prayer wont always feel rich i guess, although i sort of beleive it can if only i wasn't so racing around, yet the drugs don't work that's why i think i seek stronger moments like retreats, look into neutorpics to make me feel the way i think the connection feels like\nyeah, i love deeper trust in myself, and lack of fear of judgement, feeling ok being together with my wife around working while not working, what else bsed on my writing do you think is interesting?\n3. key readiness?\ni think i taught myslf to turn anxiety into excitement - it's just a physical sensation - i transformed it so i can do hard things, go to iraq, work in wwar zones, not be impressed by authority figures at the white hosue. i just pretend like it's all normal and i think in the end i made myself numb and don't respect anyone or anything and i watnt to opent he doors to awe again. sometimes i wonder how to do that. the baby helps, rarely when i hold him and he looks in my eyes i can feel the awe and beauty of that moment, iw ant more of that lookingat the sunrise at my wife at my poetry evne, people like my poems yet i don't feel them necessarily i get in the zone and away in the cloud of poems wanting to rain on paper, then i write, then when i read it i don't feel anything why?\nsupprot, acountability, deadlines, alhtough it would be nice to have less painful ones, like friends that i can share and show up authentically with altohugh i'm not sure who that is? pascal? nihal already has that with his friends, and i talk to much i feel like i take too much space and i can' thold the sapce because it's hard to schedule, maybe i need to be more local and do it with a new friend and person here Mohsen? he's nice, or an even older friend like Alaa? someone very different? or a diverse group? or a group that know each other? also how can i like people i know (no no muslims) when i am getting more and more focused on my muslim community inspain and gambia and hcicago while i live in frane and want to checkin with them and they don't really mix with the others?\ngentle coworking sounds good, dara is beautiful\nField cpatures \nwhat other hidden pattern styles could there be? are these the core fundamental ones? what would a professional therapist say?\nreadiness indicator?\nI like these, same, what would a coach say are also helpful?\nintegration movements i like it, maybe there's something about pride and being who i want to be, who do i want to be, how can i know that? the prophets example? people i love? seeing the world and being natural? accepting myself as not that smart, haha, and that people still can love me?\nvisibility paradox:\ni love the idea of a constant flow of money because it helps me feel like i created value that puts me into the flow of things and i want to increaase in my generosity and when it's feast or famine based on contracts - even though things keep coming - it's hard. i have my online business yet it takes so much time to pack the oils the regular sales isn't as exciting, i'd like a book, code, or something else out there that i can do that helps me see the flow and feel like giving to keep the flow going?\ni loved my workshop that nihal asked me to give to his cohort, the designing with and for marginalized communities, it gave me so much more inspiration and hope that ihave come to a landed place on the kind of offerings i want to give. although still don't know how to bring the idea of beauty innovation to business in a langugae they'd be excited by and would help them find me by searching for\nvalue giving cycle i feel awkward, shy, ashamed, like i don't deserve it, like why me? don't look, turn off camera, look away. even if i did something beautiful and if people point it out i don't want to be proud of that because that's arrogance and i don't want any of it. \nwhat would joe edelman's values card say about my value here, my attention is on feeling shy proud and ashamed, and wanting my love to be love by itself without pointing at it because it's like a rainbow and if the sun comes out directly it will all dry up, itneeds to be there in the mist, covering all and beautifying yet you can ignore it and see normally without pointing it out yet you can look and see it's there if you wanted to \naction reflection loop - i guess when i improvise on the guitar, or gave a talk yesterday at melissas house, it was ok, although afterwards i realized the kids were too young to understand my language, that i wasn't super clear, that it waasn't internalized and could have been better even if i spent 5 mins writing down some hsort hand notes - getting into the zone, into that cloud where poetry lives and then rain on paper and then flow. that an help, also to have a few touch points and guides to be sure i have a structure and flow at the same time, that there's something to leave rather than a zone to live in together for a while\nanalysis serves me when I feel like i have thought through something enough to know if i should NOT do it, haha, and to knwo when i'm going to be back in the same loop as before, and analysis that includes relationships so i know when something is truly meaningful or just a farce like the values card generator i made if i practiced the quesitons i made and took their text and fed it direct into gpt before making all that i could have made a few iterations and felt if it's nice or not instead of putting in 72 hours of work and then having my wife try it and not give a good response about it being nice and helpful and feeling bad and irritated, i have this sort of feeling like look at all the work i put into it, it's a GOOD idea, why can't you see, instead of what a real entrepreneur would have to LOOK and see how people atually take it \nfinancial safety dance - not sure, maybe invest some money daily, or cancel subscriptions, or search for new jobs, maybe even put up my no-code consulting, or AI coach meta coaching or my ocnsulting on my website and maybe just one sales email a day to some people could be good to open up a flow doing things i LOVE doing that i think also are about the transformation i want to bring into my life and the owrld moving from doing to becoming \nyeah i saw my dad lose friends over money and decided i'd never do that and made money the least important thing, although it's still important because i give it so much power over friendhip (i believe it has) so whenever anything goes wrong i say, ok is it about money take it all take it all back and would much rather be broke than fair assuming it's about money. maybe i also almost always assume it's about money instead of looking at other more deep reasons, for instance when i sell on nur if anyone complains i send all the money back all the time because i think it feels generous and uplifing and good and maybe i can ask what else would be a beautiful thing? a discount on the future? a poem? a phone call? connection? why always just moeny here, go away see i did it now we're good . i pretend money isn't important and make it super important\n5. connection protection - i would need someone who knows me well enough to reach out to and say i have a bad brain day and i don't know what they can do to help, although even just reaching out to them would already be helpful. if it could be my parents and dear friends that would be so beautiful, i want to be held and loved especially by my parents yet i need to always feel like i show them success instead of vulnerability because i want to defend my actions that took me away from them living far away, and instead i want to help them and be strong, yet perhaps if they are real friends, i should be able to be like the prophet with his wife, uncertain and afraid and asking for a blanket and holding - how beautiful yet how unsure i am able to do that. maybe we need longer chats, yet that always winds up limiting how often i call any other friends \nsmall daily weekly practice: set up a friend accountability week reflection call? book club for other friends? or learning club? or family parents club? something where i feel i have regualr connection and unifies my life and actions so i'm not always settin gup new thigns and distracting, i want more of the process here to unify things so i get \"two for the price of one\" or even three or four or ...\ncreativity structure tension\nstructure like the haiku has really helped me develop my poem practie beause without it id' just wait so long and don't do anything replicate it where? maybe ... in code? shortest code, shortest system prompt that has the deepest impact? 575 system prompt, 3 haiku system prompt? maybe 30 min phone call start and it hangs up after? prayer? working on job applications? stuff that adds up?\nmaybe i could get a job? haha i don't have a specific one and i don't know if it'd work fo rme what do you think i do need money though and sometimes i think a job in person would be great to meet up with people, optional means it ownt happen when you have a baby, a job is a must go thing. how cna i make my aikido class a must go? go with Mohsen?\n(two for one right there)\nsubstitution, hmm, i think i build things instead of giving value and connecting with people. or selling? i make new things instead of publishing and selling old things? i don't know can you derive some substitutions, i need help here\ni need help with the micro action too, maybe i should be like seth and just blog one short thing a day, no matter what and publish to my social media so there's a track record and a demonstration that im' alive feelig thinking writing poeming etc, even if the world is painful - look, see- share. I Need to venmo my friend money for gaza and ask my gaza friends if we can send money don't forget - so many things to remember, i do too many thigns, what will i say no to? how can i be confident in saying no when my life is so much better because of all the yesses that open doors that are the mycelium, maybe the yes should be constrainted, yes AND no, yes I'll help the green building council in iraq no i wont join every weekly meeting, i can only help on a call and not sure what else, without pay it's too mcuh and not exactly my strongest suite what is my strongest suite i should do that and others should do others, especially when iI'm joinign an org not starting one!\n8 readiness vs support, hmm, i'm ready when i can breathe and feel activated and my shoulders are down and nervous when my shoulders are up, and eyes darting\ntelling myself that it will never go away, helping me realize that i've been here a thousand more times, seeing my life in 10years without doing anything different and or seeing what it can be like to make more mistakes, knowing mistakes are recoverable, if the mistake is recoverable or not, one way or two way decisions, is it a door that locks or can i come back and analyse, knowing the analysis has a safe home and that it's structured and saved in a way that an LLM can bring things up that aren't lost to find the pattern in the analysis and direction and show that we're on a track and we can get back to it instead of oh my god the iron is hot lets get it all out now and hwne will i ever be in the same context window (organic context in my own brain )and how can i get back here to contineu maybe writing a poem, actually READING the whole response from the LLM and writing it back in my own words without looking at it realizing that ideas always come and having help noticing truly unique and interesitng ideas rather than just a nother alternate formulation that cna be again different and again different, i cna ask you right now to make this whole thing a metaphore about turtles and i'm sure you can and it'll be insightful, or worms, or something and it'll give me new ideas, or ask you how to do this as a mideival prince with a visir and what would the visir do instead of gpt and i'd get insights, yet are we good fo rnow how can we know when to be good, it hink these ar some good ideas you can come up with others\ni wish i felt like when i asnwered questions like this each part was read and reviewed and patterns identifieid, core ideas, identify the ideas they are related to, update the idea if it's a newer version of an old one, give the old one a version number and update the new one, and i wish i knew all the things i want to save or is intelligent to save about these things in analysis so i can move away from thinking knowing that it's making incremental progress, that each time i come and chat we're going somehwere, maybe reading it all and writing a poem at the end like right now how about that i'll do it after 9\n9 aligned action and pride\nFinishing something like the AI coaching coaching and selling it by emailing people and getting a few people to pay me a few hundred bucks would be awesome\nOr the consutling service beauty innovation and selling that, just sending emails getting on some calls could make me feel happy and pride already\nsingle transformation? maybe loving my parents, vulnerable calls, and vulnerable making and selling, making some boundaries for work, finding the 4 for the price of one and feeling confident in what i'm doing and saying no to stuff so i don't do so. many thigns running around listening to audio books while i pack bottles and cook food for baby and miss reading the ntos before the meeting and ignore messages because i didn't listen o rread the ohter wones because i didn't do the background work and to find ways to do the background work with more deadlines before the actual deadlines \n\npoem on reflection\na million and one questions\nswirling around, each sparkles, how can i not direct this machine\nTo see the heart of the heart of hearts\nthe one i could never see\nto trust the other rather than to accept the untrustworthy, yet beautiful, me\nmaybe the loss of the extraneous is the key\nto let it go to be in flow to trust that what is lost is a gift to another\nTo write is a thing\nTo reflect is to become\nThis time, you can tell me who i forgot i was\nBosa\nChatGPT\n\nThought about visibility, generosity, and action for 7 seconds\nBelow you’ll find (A) a short reflection on your current explorations, and (B) a proposed Meta Coaching Process you could use to guide others (and yourself) in building an AI-powered check-in tool—one that integrates deep self-inquiry, pattern-spotting, and gentle but firm movement toward action. This “meta structure” draws from all the discussions and frameworks we’ve hashed out so far.\n\nA. Reflections on Your Explorations\nAlone Time vs. Hiding from Judgment\n\nYou value solitude for creative flow, but you also see how it can become a shield against potential judgment or disappointment.\nKey Tension: Embracing solitude for healthy recharge vs. using it to avoid vulnerability.\nPractice: Ask yourself, “Am I here alone because I feel centered, or am I escaping connection out of fear?”\nHealthy Generosity vs. Approval-Seeking\n\nYou do have authentic generosity that brings joy, but you’re aware of a pattern where giving morphs into a means of proving worthiness.\nKey Tension: Openness to giving from a full heart vs. giving to earn acceptance or avoid being seen as “not enough.”\nPractice: When you notice the urge to give, do a quick micro-check: “Do I feel expansive or anxious in this moment of giving?”\nAll-or-Nothing Engagement\n\nYou recognize extremes energize you (ADHD/dopamine factor), but you want to move away from “on fire or offline” patterns.\nKey Tension: Harnessing the dopamine of extremes vs. building more stable rhythms that nourish you.\nPractice: Use short time blocks or “time-boxing.” Instead of marathon sessions, commit to a 30-minute intense burst, then pause, letting your mind switch guilt-free.\nMoney as a Wound\n\nYou see how ignoring finances feels safer, especially given past experiences with conflict over money.\nKey Tension: Distancing from money to preserve relationships vs. acknowledging its real importance for freedom and generosity.\nPractice: Micro-step daily: e.g., check your bank balance each morning for 30 seconds, or schedule a 15-minute budget block once a week. This normalizes money talk.\nExtremes of Analysis\n\nYour gift for deep frameworks can switch into “analysis as avoidance.”\nKey Tension: Detailed planning is valuable, but not when it substitutes for real-world testing or honest conversation.\nPractice: For any new tool/idea, run a “72-hour micro-prototype” test with real feedback before investing major time building it.\nSeeking Awe, Letting Yourself Feel\n\nYou crave genuine awe and connection—moments when you hold your baby or see a sunrise.\nKey Tension: Surviving in “numb normal” vs. cultivating deeper wonder without needing a big retreat or an extreme.\nPractice: A daily “Awe Pause”: 2–5 minutes to immerse in something small but beautiful (child’s laughter, a tree in the yard).\nConnection vs. Protection\n\nYou’re drawn to “gentle coworking,” accountability calls, or spiritual “family clubs.”\nKey Tension: Wanting to share vulnerability vs. fear you’ll “burden” or reveal your weaknesses to those close to you.\nPractice: Start small with a weekly 15-minute check-in with a trusted person—no big agenda, just “I want to share how I really am right now.”\nVisibility & Flow of Money\n\nPassive income or “continuous flow” would reassure you that you can give freely—no famine/frenzy cycles.\nKey Tension: The fantasy that a perfectly automated income frees you from judgment or discomfort vs. acknowledging real engagement often invites creative risk.\nPractice: Combine small, consistent offers (like the beauty-innovation consulting or AI coaching) with an open invitation to connect personally so you’re not fully detached from the people you serve.\nAligned Action & Pride\n\nYou want tangible accomplishments (e.g., finishing an AI-coaching offering, emailing potential clients) that make you proud while still reflecting your deeper values.\nKey Tension: Overcommitting to countless directions vs. focusing on a few that truly matter and monetizing them.\nPractice: Identify your “Big 3 Moves” for the month, and each week ensure you’ve touched each move at least once in a meaningful way.\nYour poem captures the swirling, abundant energy of your mind—an awareness of infinite possibilities alongside a yearning to find the “heart of hearts” and trust the intangible within. That tension is a source of your creativity, but it can also splinter your attention if you aren’t anchoring yourself with small, consistent steps.\n\nB. Meta Coaching Process for Creating an AI-Powered Check-In Tool\nBelow is a 5-stage model you could use to coach others (or yourself) to develop a personalized AI support system that fosters real insight and action. It’s basically what we’ve been doing but framed as a replicable blueprint.\n\nStage 1: Discovery & Container Setting\nIdentify Core Intent\n\nWhy do you (or the person you’re coaching) want an AI-powered check-in system?\nWhat outcomes feel most vital—emotional clarity, accountability, spiritual growth, business tasks, etc.?\nCreate a Safe Container\n\nSet the tone: “This is a supportive, non-judgmental space.”\nDecide on daily/weekly check-ins or “whenever you feel stuck.”\nAffirm that it’s okay to see messy truths; that’s how we move forward.\nClarify Key Patterns (like the ones you’ve identified—visibility paradox, financial avoidance, etc.)\n\nLet the coachee name 2–3 known patterns.\nReveal possible unarticulated ones if they emerge.\nOutput: A short “Purpose & Patterns” doc that states the user’s main goals and top 2–3 patterns to watch.\n\nStage 2: Framework Gathering & System Prompt Design\nGather Frameworks\n\nIntroduce any relevant patterns: e.g., “Substitution Patterns,” “All-or-Nothing Tendency,” “Action-Reflection Loop.”\nUse a simple structure: “When X, do Y.”\nCraft the System Prompt\n\nMerge the user’s core patterns + desired behavior + analysis directives (like we did with “flow indicators,” “resistance indicators,” etc.).\nInclude hidden obstacles, unarticulated needs, and supportive stances in the system prompt text.\nChoose Check-In Fields\n\nE.g., energy, prayers done, action or avoidance, small next step, “beauty moment,” etc.\nKeep it minimal and relevant to the user’s actual life circumstances.\nOutput: A config file or “Prompt Spec” capturing the user’s frameworks, hidden obstacles, and check-in fields.\n\nStage 3: Implementation & Testing\nBasic Technical Setup\n\nShow them how to store the system prompt in a local .json or .yaml, how to read it into a script, and how to call the LLM.\nSuggest daily or intermittent usage, with adaptive intervals or fixed times.\nIterative Testing\n\nStart capturing real check-ins.\nGather raw data: energy level, any discovered “substitutions,” or missed days.\nLet the LLM summarize or propose next steps. Evaluate the insights.\nImmediate Adjustments\n\nIf the system is too wordy or too strict, tweak it.\nIf the user needs more structured prompts, add them.\nIf certain fields aren’t helpful, remove or refine them.\nOutput: A running script or no-code tool (e.g., Airtable automation) that tracks daily usage, plus user feedback logs: “What did or didn’t feel right?”\n\nStage 4: Reflection & Pattern Deepening\nPeriodic Reviews\n\nWeekly or monthly, compile the data for the user.\nUse the LLM to highlight repeated obstacles: e.g., “You avoided finances 3 times, but overcame it once.”\nSpot hidden correlations (like “prayer + morning coffee = best energy”).\nIntegrate New Insights\n\nIf new hidden patterns emerge, update the system prompt.\nIf the user has a new life goal, add or swap a check-in field.\nCoach on Emotional/Spiritual Blocks\n\nLet them talk out loud about the meaning behind repeated patterns.\nEncourage them to share small successes with a friend or accountability partner if that fosters courage.\nOutput: A Reflection Report or “Weekly Insights” doc that the user can keep for deeper personal journaling.\n\nStage 5: Action Plan & Ongoing Evolution\nIdentify a Concrete Next Step\n\nEach review cycle, ask: “What real-world action (business, relational, spiritual) will you take before next check-in?”\nEmphasize finishing small tasks for a sense of closure.\nBuild a Sustainable Rhythm\n\nEncourage the user to calibrate how often they do these check-ins. Some folks prefer daily, others do better with weekly.\nIf the user dips out for a week, the system can query: “Hey, you’ve been gone—any major shifts or resistance?”\nEvolve the System\n\nOver time, the user might shift from focusing on finances to focusing on relationship vulnerability, etc.\nThe system grows with them, each stage capturing new patterns and dropping old ones.\nOutput: A living Action/Accountability structure. Potentially a regular small “cohort call” or personal “deadline day” that keeps momentum alive.\n\nWhy This Meta Coaching Process Works\nIt mimics how we’ve explored your patterns: noticing deeper themes, designing supportive prompts, testing them, reflecting on outcomes, and adjusting.\nIt ensures small next actions appear regularly, so you or your coachees can’t stay stuck in infinite reflection.\nIt honors natural flows, letting each user’s unique insights shape the structure—rather than forcing a single rigid format.\nFinal Thoughts\nYou asked, “How can I ensure I’m working on approval-seeking from anyone but God?” The meta coaching system helps surface those motivations. By consistently logging moments you feel “I need them to like me,” the AI can gently highlight them. Then you can deliberately shift your intention—“Am I doing this for spiritual alignment or human praise?”\nYou also wonder about integrating more data sources (like phone usage logs, the days you skip check-ins, or screen time). That’s absolutely possible in Stage 3—the user can tie in these logs so the AI sees “gaps” as useful data: “We noticed you didn’t check in for 3 days—what came up?”\nWhen it comes to finances, the same approach applies: let the AI nudge you with micro-tasks or reflections—“What money conversation did you avoid? Did you schedule a 15-minute budget glance?”\nUltimately, your poem captures the yearning for deeper trust and the fear of losing track of that “heart of hearts.” The true challenge is prioritizing fewer, more meaningful actions that reflect love, beauty, and authenticity—rather than scattering your energy in all directions.\nYou (and anyone you coach) can do this by:\n\nGrounding in consistent, small check-ins that track exactly the patterns you care about (visibility paradox, generosity, finances, etc.).\nReflecting on the data + AI summaries to see repeated areas of avoidance or leaps in courage.\nActing in tiny but real ways: a phone call, a 30-minute schedule, a prayer done mindfully, an email to a prospective client.\nThat synergy of reflection and actual steps, supported by an ever-evolving AI prompt, is the heart of this entire method.\n\nIn short: keep weaving your big dream of truth, love, and beauty into small day-to-day choices. That’s how your visions become lived experience—even if it’s only one tiny but brave act at a time.\n\n\nwhat's the optimum maximum minimum compilation of all these in a python config and app and any other files needed to support so i can copy paste and run "

Clone the repository\n2. Create a virtual environment\n3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n4. Run the app: `python wave_emergence.py`\n\n## Features\n- Configurable check-in fields\n- SQLite database for persistent tracking\n- Basic pattern analysis\n- Minimal, adaptable design\n\n## Philosophical Approach\nInspired by the principles of emergence, flow, and personal transformation.\n```\n\n### Installation & Running\n\n1. Save these files in a directory\n2. Create a virtual environment:\n```bash\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n3. Install requirements:\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n4. Run the app:\n```bash\npython wave_emergence.py\n```\n\n### Key Design Principles\n1. Minimal configuration\n2. Flexible check-in structure\n3. Local, privacy-first design\n4. Easy extensibility\n5. Integrated pattern recognition\n\n### Potential Future Enhancements\n- AI integration for deeper reflection\n- More sophisticated pattern analysis\n- Additional visualization\n- Export/import functionality\n- Prayer time integration\n\n### Philosophical Notes\nThis tool embodies the principles we discussed:\n- Working with natural energy flows\n- Supporting emergence\n- Minimal friction\n- Honoring personal rhythms\n\nThe app is deliberately simple, allowing for organic growth and personal customization. It's not about forcing a rigid system, but creating a gentle container for self-reflection and momentum.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation or discuss potential extensions?",

Restored full Claude integration\n2. Added default system prompt\n3. Created method to edit API key\n4. Improved error handling\n5. Added more robust configuration management\n6. Maintained original rumps-based macOS menu bar interface\n\n### Setup\n1. Install the prerequisites\n2. Set your Anthropic API key:\n   - Either via environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`\n   - Or by using the \"Edit Config\" menu option in the app\n3. Run the script\n\nThe script now:\n- Creates a menu bar app\n- Allows check-ins with multiple fields\n- Uses Claude for reflection\n- Saves check-ins and patterns\n- Provides reminders\n- Allows API key configuration\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the implementation or make any specific modifications?",

Restored full Claude integration\n2. Added default system prompt\n3. Created method to edit API key\n4. Improved error handling\n5. Added more robust configuration management\n6. Maintained original rumps-based macOS menu bar interface\n\n### Setup\n1. Install the prerequisites\n2. Set your Anthropic API key:\n   - Either via environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`\n   - Or by using the \"Edit Config\" menu option in the app\n3. Run the script\n\nThe script now:\n- Creates a menu bar app\n- Allows check-ins with multiple fields\n- Uses Claude for reflection\n- Saves check-ins and patterns\n- Provides reminders\n- Allows API key configuration\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the implementation or make any specific modifications?",

Fully integrated the specific configuration you provided\n2. Added error handling to prevent freezing\n3. Included a \"Quit\" menu option\n4. Improved file loading and client initialization\n5. More robust error logging\n\n### Setup\n1. Ensure your `presence_config.json` is in your home directory\n2. Install prerequisites\n3. Run the script\n\nThe script now:\n- Uses your exact configuration\n- Provides more robust error handling\n- Allows quitting the application\n- Logs errors to the terminal for debugging\n\nWould you like me to make any further modifications or explain any part of the implementation?",

Fully integrated the specific configuration you provided\n2. Added error handling to prevent freezing\n3. Included a \"Quit\" menu option\n4. Improved file loading and client initialization\n5. More robust error logging\n\n### Setup\n1. Ensure your `presence_config.json` is in your home directory\n2. Install prerequisites\n3. Run the script\n\nThe script now:\n- Uses your exact configuration\n- Provides more robust error handling\n- Allows quitting the application\n- Logs errors to the terminal for debugging\n\nWould you like me to make any further modifications or explain any part of the implementation?",

Maintains GUI feel\n2. Cross-platform compatibility\n3. Clean, simple input method\n4. Preserves most of the existing code structure\n5. Provides a native-feeling input experience\n\nAdvantages over current implementation:\n- Allows actual text input\n- Doesn't freeze the application\n- Provides a clear, focused input mechanism\n- Works around rumps window limitations\n\nWould you like me to integrate this solution into the full script?",

Maintains GUI feel\n2. Cross-platform compatibility\n3. Clean, simple input method\n4. Preserves most of the existing code structure\n5. Provides a native-feeling input experience\n\nAdvantages over current implementation:\n- Allows actual text input\n- Doesn't freeze the application\n- Provides a clear, focused input mechanism\n- Works around rumps window limitations\n\nWould you like me to integrate this solution into the full script?",

Restored menu bar green leaf icon\n2. Uses the specified `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` model\n3. Saves check-in data to JSON file\n4. Performs AI analysis with Claude\n5. Provides notifications for various actions\n6. Retains terminal-based pattern viewing\n\nPrerequisites:\n```bash\npip install rumps anthropic rich schedule\n```\n\nMake sure your `presence_config.json` is correctly formatted and contains the Anthropic API key.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the implementation or make any further modifications?",
