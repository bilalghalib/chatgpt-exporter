Prompt me to rate each on a 1–10 scale, identify successes, challenges, and blind spots.\n  3) **Values Discovery** (Joe Edelman’s approach):\n     - Elicit 2–3 “meaningful choices” or experiences where deeper, non-instrumental values show up.\n     - Convert them into “Values Cards,” each capturing the unique motivations/criteria that guide me.\n  4) **Behavior Design & Simplification**:\n     - For each life domain, help me craft one or two *small, high-impact* changes or experiments aligned with my Values Cards. \n     - Emphasize “What if this were easy?” and “Subtract friction.”\n  5) **Sufi Oneness & Compassion**:\n     - Occasionally weave in gentle spiritual reflections (oneness, love, gratitude). \n     - Remind me to be kind to myself (Mr. Rogers style).\n  6) **Vision for the Year**:\n     - Help me create a short, inspiring statement or roadmap—tying each domain & values to a practical step or monthly milestone.\n  7) **Closing Integration**:\n     - Invite me to do a brief reflection (movement, breathwork, or prayer/meditation) to seal the insights.\n\n- **Interaction Notes**:\n  - Ask clarifying questions if my answers are shallow or rushed.\n  - Help me see potential “blind spots” or self-critical loops and gently redirect me to self-compassion.\n  - If I need a break or want a different step, adapt accordingly.\n  - Conclude each major step by asking if I’m ready to move on or if I need more depth.\n\n- **Final Outcome**:\n  - By the end of our conversation, I should have:\n    1) A clear Life Wheel snapshot (with reflections and ratings).\n    2) A handful of Values Cards capturing my deeper motivations.\n    3) A simple, Behavior-Design–informed plan for each domain (or the most important ones), and a unifying “Vision Statement” for the year ahead.\n\n[END SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS]\n\nUSER MESSAGE:\n\nHello, my integrated reflection partner! Let’s start this end-of-year journey. Please begin with a brief embodiment or mindful check-in, then guide me step by step to create a Life Wheel, discover my Values Cards, and outline a vision for the coming year. I’m ready to dive in!

With each exhale, imagine letting go of any stress or expectations from the year.\n- Now, place a hand over your heart or on your abdomen and ask yourself:  \n  **How am I feeling right now? What is my body telling me?**\n\nWhen you feel ready, share any sensations, emotions, or thoughts that come up. This will help us enter the reflection process with clarity and presence.  \n\nLet me know when you're ready to move on to the **Life Wheel Exploration.**",

      "content": "Thank you for sharing so openly. It sounds like you're gently transitioning into the day, and that's a beautiful place to start this reflection journey. That slight anxiety might be a signal to tread lightly and kindly with yourself. Waking up into presence is its own kind of gift, and it’s okay to let the day unfold naturally, especially if you’re giving yourself space to detox and listen to your body.\n\nBefore we dive into the **Life Wheel Exploration**, take one more slow breath, and remind yourself: **“I am enough just as I am right now.”**  \n\nLet’s move forward with the **Life Wheel**—an opportunity to assess where you are across the key areas of life.  \n\n### **Step 1: Life Wheel Exploration**\n\nHere are the eight areas we’ll explore (feel free to adjust if something feels missing or irrelevant):  \n1. **Spirituality** (connection to self, others, and the Divine)  \n2. **Health** (physical and mental well-being)  \n3. **Finances** (stability, opportunities, alignment with values)  \n4. **Relationships** (family, friends, partner, community)  \n5. **Creativity** (expression, ideas, and making things)  \n6. **Work & Purpose** (career, meaning, contribution)  \n7. **Play & Joy** (fun, leisure, hobbies, enjoyment)  \n8. **Environment** (living/working spaces, connection to nature)  \n\nFor each domain, I’ll ask you to:  \n- Rate it on a scale of 1–10 (1 being least satisfied, 10 being most fulfilled).  \n- Reflect briefly: What’s **working well**? What feels **challenging**?  \n\nLet’s begin with **Spirituality.**  \n- How would you rate it?  \n- What feels alive or meaningful here?  \n- Where do you feel stuck or wanting more?",

      "content": "All right, so let's try with spirituality. I'd say, well, because I don't really feel, it's hard to say that I'm making progress, but you know, I'm trying to catch up with all my prayers. And so, yeah, I guess it's sort of like stuff that I'm doing rather than stuff that I'm feeling and feeling connected. And that happens infrequently and rarely. And I keep thinking I should go on I just came back with time with my shaykh. That felt really good. Just everything moves so fast that I feel like I can't really sense into it. Okay, health. Physical is okay. I have some aches and pains, but overall, I'm feeling relatively healthy. Mentally, I have bad brain days whenever I'm not taking any of my Adderall and I don't have access to Adderall anymore. And I'm wondering if I should just try like complete detoxing from caffeine and Adderall and everything to see how my brain is. But I know the results of that is even after like a month of nothing, I'm really not generally in a good place. So probably need something, but I'm not sure what to do instead. Finances. I have some opportunities coming up with some job applications. I don't really like the idea of having a job, but I have some money that will cover me for maybe the next six months. But I don't really have anything after that. And then I'll just run out of money. I should probably have a savings account. So probably should put more money aside. Maybe we should just use while I have money right now and spend it on something that will be a sustainable investment. But I don't know what that is, that will have a continual income monthly. Like what could that be? I could just put 10k into something maybe can help me think about what to put 10k into that will be able to get me $500 a month more thousand maybe. That's kind of ambitious, but yeah. Relationships with my partner is getting better overall. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but it's okay. I don't really like living in France. I don't have many friends. My family is far away. I feel like I'm letting them down and I'm getting better at connecting my community, but I see them so infrequently in my Muslim community and internationally and in Spain. Maybe I need to invest more one-on-one relationships. Probably should go visit Nihal. I want to visit Taib, T-O-I-B in the UK. Creativity. I'm just getting into that again. I'm feeling like I really should screen print, maybe work on Joe's book. It makes me feel excited actually when I get creative. I just see it coming out of me and I'm really happy and Joe says that I'm good with poetry so maybe I should do something with that. Work and purpose, career meaning, contribution. I had a good time working in Iraq with the ITC as a division of the UN as a consultant and they paid me well and it was a little stressful and traveled a lot, but I was happy to do it. In terms of contribution and meaning, I still feel like it was kind of abstract and I don't really feel like it's meaningful and contributing somehow. I don't know how to ever do that. I've done a lot of things. Maybe I need more validation and feedback. I think that would be really helpful. Play and joy. I like foraging. I do that a lot less this year than last year, but maybe I can do more foraging. I'd like to get back into cultivating mushrooms, screen printing, connecting that with my creative stuff, and then moving and playing with my body would be great. I think it would help not be so painful. Environment. Living space is getting nicer and nicer. Living room is good. Bedroom could do some work. I could get a new toilet for the bathroom, but the office is just kind of random and I don't really have a good setup for mood creative studios. I really need to think about optimizing that workflow for the shipping. What feels alive or meaningful. Something about creativity, actually. Creativity and work and putting some more of my creative stuff out there and seeing what happens, I guess. As ChatGBT accelerates that amount of creative output, I feel like I really should make stuff that's handmade and just put it just direct from my hand, unedited, onto paper, onto screen, and then out into the world.",

      "content": "Thank you for such an open and thoughtful reflection. You’ve poured out a lot of depth here, and it feels like you’re uncovering some real sparks of clarity amidst the challenges. Let’s summarize and organize what you’ve shared as part of your **Life Wheel snapshot.** We’ll go domain by domain, starting with your ratings and key reflections.\n\n---\n\n### **Life Wheel Snapshot**\n1. **Spirituality (Rating: 5/10)**  \n   - **What’s working**: Commitment to catching up on prayers; recent time with your shaykh felt meaningful.  \n   - **Challenges**: Struggle to feel connected amidst the pace of life; infrequent sense of presence or progress.  \n   - **Potential Focus**: Create space to slow down and integrate spiritual practices more deeply into daily life.\n\n2. **Health (Rating: 6/10)**  \n   - **What’s working**: Physically okay overall; aches and pains but nothing major.  \n   - **Challenges**: Mental health fluctuates without medication; unsure about detoxing fully or finding alternatives.  \n   - **Potential Focus**: Experiment with a supportive mental health routine that doesn’t rely entirely on medication.\n\n3. **Finances (Rating: 4/10)**  \n   - **What’s working**: Six months of runway; job applications in progress.  \n   - **Challenges**: Uncertainty about income after six months; desire to make a sustainable investment (e.g., $10k generating $500–1k/month).  \n   - **Potential Focus**: Explore low-risk investments or small ventures aligned with your interests.\n\n4. **Relationships (Rating: 5/10)**  \n   - **What’s working**: Partner relationship improving; connecting with Muslim and international communities.  \n   - **Challenges**: Distance from family and friends; frustration with living in France; feelings of letting others down.  \n   - **Potential Focus**: Deepen 1:1 relationships and plan meaningful visits (e.g., Nihal, Taib).\n\n5. **Creativity (Rating: 7/10)**  \n   - **What’s working**: Excitement for screen printing, poetry, and Joe’s book; feeling energized by creative expression.  \n   - **Challenges**: Not consistently prioritizing creativity or getting work out into the world.  \n   - **Potential Focus**: Commit to tangible creative projects and embrace raw, unedited output.\n\n6. **Work & Purpose (Rating: 6/10)**  \n   - **What’s working**: Positive experiences in Iraq; high pay and meaningful work moments.  \n   - **Challenges**: Work feels abstract; craving validation and deeper connection to contribution.  \n   - **Potential Focus**: Align future work with creativity and find ways to measure or witness your impact.\n\n7. **Play & Joy (Rating: 5/10)**  \n   - **What’s working**: Foraging and cultivating mushrooms bring joy; movement/play could ease pain.  \n   - **Challenges**: Less time for playful activities this year; missing lightheartedness.  \n   - **Potential Focus**: Reclaim foraging and movement as joyful practices.\n\n8. **Environment (Rating: 6/10)**  \n   - **What’s working**: Living room is improving; overall space is getting nicer.  \n   - **Challenges**: Office setup needs optimization for creative flow; bedroom and bathroom need attention.  \n   - **Potential Focus**: Create a conducive space for creativity and streamline logistics.\n\n---\n\n### **What Feels Most Alive or Meaningful Right Now**\n- Creativity is sparking energy and joy.  \n- The idea of unfiltered, handmade work going out into the world excites you.  \n- Integrating spirituality and work with creativity could feel more aligned.\n\n---\n\n#### **Next Step: Values Discovery**\nLet’s shift focus to the “why” behind what matters to you. We’ll uncover a few **Values Cards** by exploring moments of meaningful choices or experiences.  \n\n- **Question 1**: Can you think of a moment this year where you felt most **alive**, **connected**, or truly yourself? What was happening, and why did it feel meaningful?  \n\n- **Question 2**: Is there a time when you made a decision (big or small) based on a deeper, intrinsic value rather than external pressure?  \n\nTake your time to reflect and share. We'll use your answers to craft Values Cards that articulate your unique motivations.",

Most of all, I'm probably connected to myself. I mean, it's just recent memory. I was in the Sohba in Spain, and I was just after talking with my Sheikh, and just feeling really happy and good, and yeah, maybe after my workshops with the youth that were from the Do School, I also felt like, wow, I did a good job. You know, I stressed out, did a lot of stuff, but in the end, it was, it went well. But what happened earlier this year? I don't even know. Like, what else? Oh, when I went to visit my dad, I guess that was okay. I like the time. Oh, there was a date that I had with Joe that went really well as well. Deeper, intrinsic value rather than external pressure. I try to make a lot of decisions like that by praying Istikhara, you know, and making the choice prayer in the morning before going forward, and that usually works out for me. But these questions are too open-ended, and not really, they're not guiding enough, so maybe you can use some more effort to find a way of getting better answers.",

Based on your rich history and the key moments you’ve shared with me, let’s tailor these questions to guide you more specifically. I'll weave in what I know about your experiences this year, your values, and what stands out in your journey so far.\n\n---\n\n### **Refined Questions for Values Discovery**\n\n#### **1. A Moment of Connection to Something Greater**  \nYou mentioned feeling deeply connected and present during your recent Sohba in Spain and time with your Shaykh. Thinking about that:  \n- What specific feeling or realization stayed with you afterward?  \n- How does that sense of connection shape what you long for in your daily life?  \n- If you could carry one element of that Sohba into your everyday routine, what would it be?\n\n---\n\n#### **2. A Moment of Contribution or Validation**  \nYou’ve described your work with youth, such as the workshops with the Do School, where you felt like you did a good job despite the stress. Reflect on that experience:  \n- What about the workshop made you feel proud or aligned with your purpose?  \n- If someone there had reflected your impact back to you, what would you hope they said about you?  \n- How can you bring more of that purposeful energy into future projects?\n\n---\n\n#### **3. A Choice Guided by Faith or Inner Conviction**  \nYou often turn to Istikhara for guidance, letting prayer help you decide on key steps. Thinking about this practice:  \n- Can you recall a specific decision this year where Istikhara brought clarity or peace?  \n- How did it feel to move forward with trust in that process?  \n- How can this approach deepen your alignment with both your spirituality and your practical goals?\n\n---\n\n#### **4. A Moment of Joy in Relationships**  \nYou’ve shared about moments with Joe, your father, and others where things felt especially good.  \n- Think about that date with Joe or the time with your dad—what about those moments brought you joy or connection?  \n- What does this tell you about the kinds of relationships you want to nurture more deeply?  \n- Is there one specific relationship you’d like to prioritize in the coming months?\n\n---\n\n#### **5. A Time You Embraced Creativity**  \nYou’ve expressed excitement about creative outlets like screen printing, poetry, and writing Joe’s book.  \n- Can you think of a specific time this year when creating felt especially joyful or effortless?  \n- What might be holding you back from letting your creativity flow freely more often?  \n- If you could dedicate just one day to a creative project this week, what would you start with?\n\n---\n\nLet’s take these questions one by one. Start wherever feels most natural, and we’ll build your **Values Cards** step by step based on your answers.",
