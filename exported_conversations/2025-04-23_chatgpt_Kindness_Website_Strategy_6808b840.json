I want it to help someone identify things that will make them come alive, like joe edelman talks about when he talks about sources of meaning, and connects them to small acts of kindness that they can do that they will really probably want to do and will feel exciting and energizing and like a good life and would like to gather the information needed and to know the factors that might be in this space that we'd need to identify to give really pinpoint awesome suggestions, what research is available and what ideas do you have for how to do this well and what would your list of factors be and whyEditExcavated meaningful kindness strategies through psychological research framework27sLet me think about this request in depth. The person is asking for help with a \"random acts of kindness\" website concept with some specific characteristics:\n\nThey want it to help people identify things that will \"make them come alive\" - referencing Joe Edelman's concept of \"sources of meaning\"\nThe site should connect users to small acts of kindness that:\n\nThey will genuinely want to do\nWill feel exciting and energizing\nWill contribute to a good life\n\n\nThey want help gathering information and identifying factors to provide excellent suggestions\nThey want to know what research is available on this topic\nThey're looking for my ideas on how to do this well\nThey want a list of factors I would consider and why\n\nI should first understand what Joe Edelman means by \"sources of meaning\" to frame my response properly. Then I should think about the research on acts of kindness, motivation, wellbeing, and how they interconnect.\nEdelman's \"sources of meaning\" concept, as I understand it, focuses on identifying what activities and interactions genuinely create meaning for individuals, beyond extrinsic motivations or social pressures. It's about finding intrinsic values that energize and inspire.\nLet me structure my thinking:\n\nUnderstanding meaning and values (Joe Edelman's framework)\nResearch on acts of kindness and wellbeing\nKey factors to consider for personalized kindness suggestions\nImplementation ideas for the website\nMeaningful personalization approaches\n\nFor the first point, I'll consider what makes activities meaningful to people according to research and Edelman's approach. For the second, I'll think about empirical research on how acts of kindness affect both givers and receivers. For the third, I'll identify key factors that might determine what types of kind acts would resonate with different people. For the fourth, I'll consider how the website might be structured to capture and utilize these factors. For the fifth, I'll think about how to connect individual values/interests with appropriate acts of kindness.\nI also notice from the user preferences that this person:\n\nLikes metaphors for explaining concepts\nPrefers Python for coding examples\nAppreciates constructive criticism and pushback (not just agreement)\nDoesn't like flattery\nOnly wants things described as \"unique/groundbreaking/wonderful\" if truly warranted\n\nWith these preferences in mind, I'll provide some thoughtful metaphors, be willing to point out potential challenges or limitations in their idea (constructive criticism), and be judicious with praise.\nNow, let me address the core components of this request:\n1. Understanding Meaning and Values (Joe Edelman's Framework)\nJoe Edelman's work on \"sources of meaning\" is about understanding what genuinely matters to people as individuals, beyond social pressures or received values. Instead of focusing on abstract values like \"helping others,\" he encourages identifying specific activities and contexts that feel meaningful and alive to each person.\nFor example, one person might find meaning in teaching skills to others, while another finds it in creating beautiful environments, and another in resolving conflicts. These are more specific than generic values like \"kindness\" or \"creativity\" - they're particular ways those values manifest for individuals.\n2. Research on Acts of Kindness and Wellbeing\nThere's substantial research on how performing acts of kindness affects wellbeing:\n\nStudies show that performing acts of kindness boosts happiness and life satisfaction\nThe \"helper's high\" phenomenon describes the positive emotional state after helping others\nNot all acts of kindness are equally beneficial - those that connect to personal values and strengths tend to be more rewarding\nAutonomy is important - kindness acts that feel forced or obligatory don't produce the same benefits\nThere's evidence that variety matters - doing the same kind act repeatedly may lead to hedonic adaptation\nSocial connection in kindness acts tends to amplify their positive effects\n\n3. Key Factors to Consider for Personalized Kindness Suggestions\nTo create truly resonant suggestions, these factors might be important:\na) Personal values and sources of meaning:\n\nWhat activities make this person feel most alive?\nWhat kinds of impact do they care about most?\nWhat stories of impact move them emotionally?\n\nb) Skills, strengths, and resources:\n\nWhat are they particularly good at?\nWhat resources do they have available (time, money, connections, knowledge)?\nWhat environments do they have access to?\n\nc) Social connections and contexts:\n\nWho do they interact with regularly?\nWhat communities are they part of?\nWho might they want to impact or connect with?\n\nd) Practical constraints:\n\nHow much time do they have available?\nWhat's their energy level and capacity?\nAny physical or logistical limitations?\n\ne) Past experiences:\n\nWhat kinds of helping have felt good in the past?\nWhat feels draining or uncomfortable?\nWhat new experiences might they be open to?\n\nf) Personality factors:\n\nIntroversion/extraversion spectrum\nComfort with recognition/visibility\nPreference for structure vs. spontaneity\nValues around reciprocity vs. anonymity\n\n4. Implementation Ideas for the Website\nThe website could include:\na) Assessment components:\n\nInteractive exercises to identify personal sources of meaning\nValue clarification activities\nSkills and resources inventory\nPersonality quizzes related to helping styles\n\nb) Suggestion engine:\n\nAlgorithm that matches personal profiles with appropriate acts\nFiltering system for practical constraints\nRating/feedback system to improve suggestions over time\n\nc) Experience components:\n\nJournaling feature to capture experiences and reflections\nCommunity sharing of experiences (if desired)\nProgressive challenges that build on past activities\n\nd) Evidence-based education:\n\nResearch snippets explaining why certain approaches work\nTips for maximizing wellbeing benefits\nGuidance on avoiding common pitfalls\n\n5. Meaningful Personalization Approaches\nThe critical insight here is that truly meaningful kindness acts sit at the intersection of:\n\nWhat genuinely serves others\nWhat aligns with the person's values and sources of meaning\nWhat fits practically into their life\n\nFor example, someone who comes alive when creating beautiful environments might:\n\nPlant flowers in neglected public spaces\nHelp an elderly neighbor organize their cluttered home\nCreate care packages with aesthetic attention to detail\n\nWhile someone who comes alive through teaching might:\n\nOffer free lessons in their area of expertise\nCreate accessible guides to complex topics\nMentor someone facing a challenge they've overcome\n\nNow, to compile this into a response for the user that includes:\n\nThoughtful metaphors (per their preference)\nSome constructive pushback on potential challenges\nPython code concepts where relevant\nA clear outline of factors to consider\nResearch insights\nImplementation suggestions\n\nI'll also keep my response focused and avoid unnecessary lists as mentioned in my guidelines, and I won't be excessively flattering about their idea (per their preferences).Building a Meaningful Acts of Kindness Platform\nYour concept reminds me of a garden where we're trying to match seeds (people's inner drives) with the right soil (opportunities for kindness) - not every plant thrives in the same conditions, just as not every act of kindness resonates with every person.\nUnderstanding Sources of Meaning\nJoe Edelman's work on sources of meaning focuses on identifying what specifically brings people alive - the particular activities and contexts where they feel most engaged and fulfilled. Rather than abstract values like \"creativity,\" it's about concrete expressions like \"helping others master new skills\" or \"transforming chaotic spaces into orderly ones.\"\nKey Research Insights\nResearch on acts of kindness shows several important findings:\nStudies demonstrate that not all acts of kindness provide equal benefits - those aligned with personal values create significantly greater wellbeing. For example, research by Sheldon & Lyubomirsky found that sustained wellbeing comes from activities that satisfy core psychological needs like autonomy and competence.\nThe \"helper's high\" phenomenon (documented by Allan Luks) produces endorphin release similar to physical exercise, but this effect diminishes when actions feel obligatory rather than freely chosen.\nImportantly, variety matters - the hedonic adaptation principle suggests that repeating identical acts diminishes their emotional impact over time.\nCrucial Factors for Your Platform\nTo create truly resonant suggestions, I'd consider:\n\nSources of meaning identification - Exercises to help people discover their specific energizing activities (not just abstract values)\nSkill-kindness alignment - What are they naturally good at that others would benefit from?\nPsychological profile factors - Introversion/extraversion, preference for recognition vs. anonymity, structure vs. spontaneity\nPractical constraints - Time availability, physical capabilities, accessible environments\nImpact preferences - Do they prefer seeing immediate emotional reactions or contributing to long-term change?\nNarrative resonance - What stories of impact move them emotionally?\nSocial connection comfort - Direct interaction vs. behind-the-scenes support\n\nImplementation Challenges\nOne potential weakness in your approach might be assuming people have clear insight into what makes them \"come alive.\" Most people struggle with this self-knowledge. You might need iterative exploration rather than expecting accurate self-reporting upfront.\nAdditionally, be cautious about framing kindness purely as self-fulfillment - this risks making altruism instrumental rather than intrinsic. The most meaningful acts often balance self-fulfillment with genuine other-orientation.\nTechnical Approach\nFor the matching algorithm, you might consider using a recommendation system that learns from feedback. In Python, you could implement this with:\npythondef generate_kindness_recommendations(user_profile, feedback_history):\n    # Calculate compatibility scores between user profile and kindness acts\n    compatibility_scores = {}\n    \n    for act in kindness_database:\n        # Base score on profile match\n        initial_score = calculate_profile_match(user_profile, act)\n        \n        # Adjust based on feedback from similar users\n        similarity_adjustment = collaborative_filtering_score(user_profile, act, feedback_history)\n        \n        # Apply exploration factor for variety\n        exploration_bonus = novelty_score(user_profile, act, feedback_history)\n        \n        compatibility_scores[act] = initial_score + similarity_adjustment + exploration_bonus\n    \n    # Return top recommendations\n    return sorted(compatibility_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]\nWhat makes this concept potentially powerful is that it treats kindness not as a generic moral obligation but as a pathway to personal flourishing when properly aligned with individual meaning sources. Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of this in more detail?RetryBGok, what are ways we can get some stories using an LLM to extrapolate and infer their sources of meaning, perhaps from movies they love, or a short story they can tell about a meaningful moment? what's the simplest way we identify a source of meaning that aligns with the factors related to the most impactful random act of kindness - also can you help me rephrase and clarify what I'm asking, you can come up with 5 ways to describe it and then answer the question about how to get stories or other approaches to finding the factorsEditDecoded methods to uncover personal meaning through storytelling9sThe user is asking for ways to identify sources of meaning for people, potentially using an LLM to make inferences based on inputs like movies they love or stories about meaningful moments. They want to know the simplest way to identify sources of meaning that align with factors related to impactful random acts of kindness. They also want help rephrasing and clarifying their question, with 5 different ways to describe it, before I answer how to get stories or other approaches to finding these factors.\nFirst, let me rephrase their question in 5 different ways to ensure I understand what they're asking:\n\n\"How can we use AI to analyze people's preferences and stories to identify what gives them meaning, and then match those insights to suitable acts of kindness they would find fulfilling?\"\n\"What methods, particularly using LLMs, could help us extract a person's sources of meaning from their cultural preferences or personal anecdotes, to better suggest random acts of kindness that would resonate with them?\"\n\"What's the most efficient approach to determine what makes someone 'come alive' through analyzing their favorite media or personal stories, so we can suggest kindness activities aligned with their intrinsic motivations?\"\n\"How can we develop a system that uses AI to infer people's meaningful drives from their stories and preferences, then match these drives to corresponding kindness opportunities?\"\n\"What techniques can we use to identify the alignment between a person's sources of meaning (as revealed through their stories and preferences) and potential acts of kindness that would feel most authentic and energizing to them?\"\n\nNow, I'll answer their question about how to get stories or other approaches to finding these factors.\nI should focus on the user's preference for metaphors to explain concepts, and I'll aim to give some constructive criticism where appropriate but avoid unnecessary flattery. I'll also focus on providing Python ideas since they mentioned that preference.Extracting Sources of Meaning for Kindness Alignment\nYour question reminds me of a detective trying to find hidden treasures in someone's life story - the clues are often there, but we need the right tools to uncover them.\nLet me rephrase what you're asking in a few ways to make sure I understand:\n\nHow can we use AI to extract meaningful personal patterns from someone's stories or preferences?\nWhat methods would efficiently connect someone's intrinsic motivations to fitting acts of kindness?\nHow might we map someone's \"aliveness triggers\" to kindness opportunities that energize rather than drain?\nWhat techniques reveal the intersection between what brings people joy and how they can authentically help others?\nHow can we design a system that matches personal meaning sources with kindness activities for maximum impact?\n\nApproaches to Extracting Meaning Sources\n1. Media Analysis Technique\nPeople's favorite stories often reveal what moves them. An LLM could analyze:\npythondef analyze_favorite_media(media_list):\n    meaning_patterns = {}\n    \n    for item in media_list:\n        # Extract themes, character motivations, emotional triggers\n        themes = extract_themes(item)\n        character_values = extract_character_values(item)\n        emotional_peaks = identify_emotional_peaks(item)\n        \n        # Look for recurring patterns across different media\n        update_patterns(meaning_patterns, themes, character_values, emotional_peaks)\n    \n    return prioritize_meaning_sources(meaning_patterns)\nA potential weakness here is that people often enjoy media for reasons they don't consciously recognize. The system would need to dig beyond surface-level content identification.\n2. Peak Experience Mining\nAsk users to share 2-3 moments when they felt most alive and engaged. An LLM could process these stories to identify patterns:\npythondef extract_meaning_from_peak_experiences(stories):\n    # Initialize meaning categories based on psychological frameworks\n    meaning_categories = initialize_meaning_framework()\n    \n    for story in stories:\n        # Extract key elements: context, actions, emotions, values expressed\n        context = extract_context(story)\n        actions = extract_actions(story)\n        emotions = extract_emotions(story)\n        values = infer_values(story)\n        \n        # Map to meaning categories with confidence scores\n        for category in meaning_categories:\n            category.score += calculate_alignment(category, context, actions, emotions, values)\n    \n    return sorted(meaning_categories, key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True)\n3. Values-Based Scenario Testing\nPresent hypothetical scenarios and analyze responses:\n\"If you had a free day and could do anything, what would make you feel it was time well spent?\"\n\"What kind of problems do you find yourself naturally wanting to solve for others?\"\n4. Implicit Association Testing\nCreate a digital version of implicit association tests that measure reaction times to meaning-related concepts, potentially revealing unconscious preferences.\n5. Behavioral Pattern Analysis\nWith permission, analyze digital behavior (what articles they read, what they share, where they spend time online) to identify meaning patterns.\nImplementation Challenge\nThe most difficult aspect isn't just extracting meaning sources - it's connecting them properly to kindness acts. Someone might be moved by stories of overcoming adversity, but this doesn't automatically tell us if they'd prefer mentoring struggling students or supporting community resilience projects.\nA potential solution is creating a two-dimensional mapping:\npythondef map_meaning_to_kindness(meaning_sources, kindness_database):\n    recommendations = []\n    \n    for source in meaning_sources:\n        # First dimension: Activity alignment (what they do)\n        activity_matches = find_activities_by_source(source, kindness_database)\n        \n        # Second dimension: Impact alignment (what effect it has)\n        impact_matches = find_impacts_by_source(source, kindness_database)\n        \n        # Find kindness acts at the intersection\n        for act in kindness_database:\n            if act in activity_matches and act in impact_matches:\n                recommendations.append((act, \"High Alignment\"))\n            elif act in activity_matches or act in impact_matches:\n                recommendations.append((act, \"Partial Alignment\"))\n    \n    return sorted(recommendations, key=lambda x: alignment_score(x[0], meaning_sources))\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific approach, or help you think through how to implement one of these techniques in more detail?RetryBGalso we'd need to know their relationships etc. I like the meaning connection and here's some additonal thoughts: i was hoping to find factors that we can use to them make profiles for the various kinds of people so someone can say I'm a \"buy a coffee for the person behind you in line kindness kind of person\" and it has anonymity, money, etc - or another might be a I'm the clean the toilet in the mosque kind of guy, etc or massage my wife while she's workign etc \nand to find the profile and the factors in the profile - can you think through this and give it a first attemptEditCrafted nuanced kindness archetypes with detailed matching framework.32sThe user is asking me to expand on my previous analysis to think about how to create profiles or archetypes based on the factors we've identified for different kinds of acts of kindness. They want me to categorize people based on the types of kind acts they prefer (like \"buying coffee for the person behind you in line\" or \"cleaning the toilet in the mosque\"), taking into account various factors like anonymity, money involved, etc.\nI need to:\n\nCreate a system for profiling different \"kindness types\" or archetypes\nIdentify the key factors that differentiate these profiles\nShow how these factors can be used to categorize and match people to suitable acts of kindness\nInclude relationships as a factor since the user mentioned that explicitly\nGive a first attempt at creating such profiles\n\nFirst, let me think about the key factors that would differentiate these kindness profiles:\nKey Factors for Kindness Profiles:\n\nRelationship Context:\n\nFamily/household (e.g., spouse, children, parents)\nFriends\nCoworkers/professional\nCommunity members\nStrangers\nOnline/distant\n\n\nResource Type:\n\nTime-based (giving attention, service)\nMoney-based (purchasing, donating)\nSkill-based (using specific abilities)\nPhysical effort (labor, endurance)\nEmotional labor (listening, supporting)\n\n\nVisibility/Recognition:\n\nAnonymous\nKnown only to recipient\nKnown to immediate circle\nPublicly recognized\n\n\nInteraction Level:\n\nDirect, face-to-face\nIndirect but personal (e.g., handwritten note)\nCompletely indirect (e.g., donation)\nDigital/virtual\n\n\nTime Commitment:\n\nMomentary (seconds to minutes)\nShort session (under an hour)\nExtended (hours)\nRecurring/habitual\n\n\nPreparation Required:\n\nSpontaneous\nMinimal planning\nModerate preparation\nSignificant planning\n\n\nScope of Impact:\n\nIndividual\nSmall group\nCommunity\nLarger society\n\n\nEmotional Tone:\n\nPractical/helpful\nCelebratory/joyful\nComforting/supportive\nSurprising/delighting\n\n\nNovelty Factor:\n\nRoutine/familiar\nSomewhat fresh\nHighly creative/unexpected\n\n\nPhysical Location:\n\nHome\nWorkplace\nPublic spaces\nReligious/community centers\nOnline\n\n\n\nNow, I'll create some archetype profiles based on combinations of these factors:\nKindness Archetypes:\n\nThe Spontaneous Brightener\n\nExample: \"Buy coffee for the person behind you in line\" person\nKey factors: Strangers, money-based, anonymous, direct interaction, momentary, spontaneous, individual impact, surprising, public spaces\n\n\nThe Behind-the-Scenes Supporter\n\nExample: \"Clean the toilet in the mosque\" person\nKey factors: Community members, time/effort-based, anonymous or low recognition, indirect interaction, short session, minimal planning, group impact, practical/helpful, community spaces\n\n\nThe Intimate Nurturer\n\nExample: \"Massage my wife while she's working\" person\nKey factors: Family, time/physical effort, known only to recipient, direct interaction, short session, spontaneous, individual impact, comforting/supportive, home\n\n\nThe Thoughtful Planner\n\nExample: \"Organize a surprise birthday celebration\" person\nKey factors: Friends/family, time/money based, known to immediate circle, direct interaction, extended time, significant planning, small group impact, celebratory/joyful, varies by location\n\n\nThe Skill Sharer\n\nExample: \"Teach someone a skill they want to learn\" person\nKey factors: Various relationships, skill-based, known to recipient, direct interaction, extended time, moderate preparation, individual impact, practical/helpful, varies by location\n\n\nThe Community Builder\n\nExample: \"Start a neighborhood tool-sharing system\" person\nKey factors: Community members, time/skill based, public recognition, direct/indirect interaction, recurring, significant planning, community impact, practical/helpful, local area\n\n\nThe Digital Supporter\n\nExample: \"Send encouraging messages to people struggling online\" person\nKey factors: Online relationships, emotional labor, varies in recognition, digital interaction, momentary, spontaneous, individual impact, comforting/supportive, online\n\n\nThe Resource Provider\n\nExample: \"Donate monthly to effective charities\" person\nKey factors: Strangers, money-based, varies in recognition, indirect, recurring, minimal planning, larger society impact, practical/helpful, n/a location\n\n\n\nNow I'll create a system for how these factors could be used to match people to suitable acts of kindness:\nProfile Matching System\nThe system could work by:\n\nHaving users complete a brief assessment that identifies their preferences across the key factors\nCreating a weighted profile based on their responses\nMatching them with kindness acts that align with their profile\nOver time, learning from their feedback to refine recommendations\n\nHere's a conceptual example of how this might work:\npythondef create_user_profile(responses):\n    profile = {\n        \"relationship_preference\": calculate_relationship_preference(responses),\n        \"resource_preference\": calculate_resource_preference(responses),\n        \"visibility_preference\": calculate_visibility_preference(responses),\n        \"interaction_preference\": calculate_interaction_preference(responses),\n        \"time_preference\": calculate_time_preference(responses),\n        \"preparation_preference\": calculate_preparation_preference(responses),\n        \"impact_preference\": calculate_impact_preference(responses),\n        \"emotional_tone_preference\": calculate_emotional_tone_preference(responses),\n        \"novelty_preference\": calculate_novelty_preference(responses),\n        \"location_preference\": calculate_location_preference(responses),\n    }\n    \n    # Identify primary and secondary archetype matches\n    archetypes = match_to_archetypes(profile)\n    profile[\"primary_archetype\"] = archetypes[0]\n    profile[\"secondary_archetype\"] = archetypes[1] if len(archetypes) > 1 else None\n    \n    return profile\n\ndef match_to_kindness_acts(profile, acts_database):\n    matches = []\n    \n    for act in acts_database:\n        # Calculate compatibility score\n        score = 0\n        for factor in profile:\n            if factor in [\"primary_archetype\", \"secondary_archetype\"]:\n                continue\n            \n            if factor in act:\n                # Weight the importance of each factor\n                factor_weight = get_factor_weight(factor)\n                # Calculate similarity between profile preference and act characteristic\n                similarity = calculate_similarity(profile[factor], act[factor])\n                score += factor_weight * similarity\n        \n        # Apply archetype bonus\n        if profile[\"primary_archetype\"] == act[\"archetype\"]:\n            score *= 1.5\n        elif profile[\"secondary_archetype\"] == act[\"archetype\"]:\n            score *= 1.2\n        \n        matches.append((act, score))\n    \n    # Sort by score\n    matches.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    return matches[:10]  # Return top 10 matches\nThe user assessment could include questions like:\n\n\"Would you prefer to help someone you know well, or to help a stranger?\"\n\"Do you prefer to see the immediate impact of your kindness, or are you comfortable with more indirect effects?\"\n\"Would you rather give your time, money, or special skills?\"\n\"Do you prefer acts that can be done spontaneously, or are you willing to plan ahead?\"\n\"Are you more energized by public or private acts of kindness?\"\n\nBased on these answers, they could be categorized into one of the archetype profiles, which would help guide recommendations.\nLet me now go back and review what I've done to ensure it's a solid first attempt at what the user is asking for.\nIt looks like I've:\n\nCreated a comprehensive set of factors that differentiate kindness acts\nDeveloped several distinct archetypes based on combinations of these factors\nProvided example acts for each archetype\nOutlined a conceptual matching system\nIncluded relationships as a specific factor as requested\n\nThis should provide a good first attempt at creating profiles and factors for different kinds of kindness acts as requested. I'll now compose my response.Kindness Personality Profiles: Matching Who You Are With How You Give\nYour idea of creating profiles that match people's natural inclinations with fitting acts of kindness is brilliant. It's like matching musical instruments to musicians - not everyone expresses themselves through the same medium.\nCore Kindness Factors (Profile Dimensions)\nHere's my first attempt at identifying the key factors that would create distinct kindness personalities:\n\nRelationship Proximity\n\nFamily-centered → Stranger-oriented\nExample: \"Massage my wife while she's working\" vs. \"Buy coffee for the next customer\"\n\n\nVisibility Preference\n\nAnonymous → Recognized\nExample: \"Secretly pay someone's utility bill\" vs. \"Organize a public fundraiser\"\n\n\nResource Type\n\nTime/Energy → Money → Skills\nExample: \"Help elderly neighbor with yard work\" vs. \"Fund a scholarship\" vs. \"Fix someone's computer\"\n\n\nInteraction Level\n\nDirect contact → Indirect/Behind-scenes\nExample: \"Visit hospital patients\" vs. \"Leave encouraging notes on windshields\"\n\n\nSpontaneity Spectrum\n\nImpromptu → Planned\nExample: \"Give up your seat on the bus\" vs. \"Organize a surprise party\"\n\n\nImpact Scope\n\nIndividual → Community → Society\nExample: \"Listen to a friend in crisis\" vs. \"Clean up neighborhood park\" vs. \"Volunteer for systemic change\"\n\n\nPhysical Environment\n\nHome → Work → Public → Online\nExample: \"Cook a special meal\" vs. \"Mentor a colleague\" vs. \"Help lost tourists\"\n\n\nEmotional Tone\n\nPractical/Problem-solving → Celebratory → Comforting\nExample: \"Fix something broken\" vs. \"Throw a congratulations party\" vs. \"Sit with someone grieving\"\n\n\n\nSample Kindness Personality Profiles\nUsing these factors, here are some example profiles:\n\"The Spontaneous Brightener\"\n\nPrefers: Strangers, anonymity, money-based, brief interactions, public spaces\nSignature acts: Pay the toll for the car behind you, leave generous tips with kind notes, hide dollar bills in library books\n\n\"The Behind-the-Scenes Sustainer\"\n\nPrefers: Community, anonymity, effort-based, indirect, recurring\nSignature acts: Clean the mosque bathroom, stock community pantry weekly, secretly maintain a neighborhood garden\n\n\"The Intimate Nurturer\"\n\nPrefers: Close relationships, recognition, time/touch-based, direct, home environment\nSignature acts: Massage partner while they work, cook special meals, create personalized care packages\n\n\"The Skill Gifter\"\n\nPrefers: Various relationships, recognition, skill-based, direct teaching, planned\nSignature acts: Teach free classes in your expertise, offer professional services pro bono, create helpful guides\n\n\"The Digital Supporter\"\n\nPrefers: Online connections, semi-anonymous, emotional support, brief interactions\nSignature acts: Send encouraging messages to content creators, help moderate online communities, create helpful resources\n\nPractical Implementation\nTo identify someone's profile, you could:\n\nStory Analysis: Have users share stories of kindness they've done or received that felt meaningful. An LLM could extract their factor preferences from these narratives.\n\npythondef analyze_kindness_story(story_text):\n    # Extract key elements that reveal preferences\n    preferences = {\n        \"relationship_proximity\": extract_relationship_context(story_text),\n        \"visibility_preference\": extract_visibility_preference(story_text),\n        \"resource_type\": extract_resource_type(story_text),\n        # Additional factors...\n    }\n    \n    # Match to closest archetype profile\n    archetype = determine_primary_archetype(preferences)\n    \n    return archetype, preferences\n\nQuiz Approach: Present scenario choices that reveal preferences:\n\n\"You have $20 to use for kindness. Would you rather: a) Buy coffee for strangers, b) Purchase art supplies for a child, c) Contribute to a community project\"\n\n\nProfile Browser: Let users browse example profiles and select what resonates: \"I'm definitely a 'Behind-the-Scenes Sustainer'\"\n\nThe real power is connecting these profiles to a database of kindness acts tagged with the same factors, allowing for personalized recommendations that energize rather than drain the giver.\nWould you like me to develop any particular aspect of this system further? I could elaborate on the assessment process, the matching algorithm, or how to build the kindness acts database.RetryOkay. This is great. I wanted to also take this and turn it into a sort of, Application or I can use something very simple to create a way for people to log in create anonymous accounts to somehow give information to help pro profile themselves according to the different kinds of random acts of kindpastedBGi don't need all this focus on python \nHere's some additional information we can compare with our work and find a synergized unionEditSynthesized kindness profiling framework with research-backed insights.9sLet me analyze the document content compared to our previous work, and create a synergized approach for the random acts of kindness profiling system. I'll focus less on Python implementation specifics and more on the conceptual framework.\nThe document you shared appears to contain a discussion about creating a kindness profiling system, similar to what we've been discussing. It includes several sections:\n\nA framework for kindness profiling with dimensions like:\n\nPersonal Context & Resources (relationships, environment, time)\nPersonal Gifts & Strengths (creative abilities, interpersonal strengths, practical skills)\nValue & Motivation Dimensions (impact style, growth edges, value orientation)\n\n\nImplementation approaches including:\n\nProgressive questionnaires\nVisual elements\nMatching systems based on effort, context, gift utilization, and surprise factor\n\n\nTechnical implementation suggestions using no-code/low-code options\nResearch considerations, including:\n\nProsocial behavior research\nFive love languages framework\nCharacter strengths research\nPersonality research\n\n\nThe idea of using proxy questions as a \"stealth assessment\" to gather information without overwhelming users\n\nThere are several good insights here that complement and extend our previous discussion. The document especially emphasizes research foundations, proxy questions to minimize user burden, and a more structured dimensional framework.\nLet me create a synergized approach that combines the best of our previous work with these insights.Kindness Profiling System: A Synthesized Approach\nLooking at our previous work alongside this new information, I see a beautiful opportunity to create something like a \"kindness matchmaking service\" - connecting people with acts that will feel like meeting an old friend rather than an awkward blind date.\nCore Framework: The Kindness Profile Matrix\nCombining our previous factors with the research mentioned in your document, I've created this integrated framework:\n1. Personal Context (Who & Where You Are)\n\nRelationship Web: Family proximity, partnership status, friendship circles\nEnvironmental Setting: Urban/suburban/rural, mobility access, workspace type\nTemporal Patterns: Available time pockets, energy patterns, spontaneity comfort\n\n2. Giving Expression (How You Give)\n\nVisibility Spectrum: Anonymous → Recognized\nInteraction Depth: Brief encounter → Sustained relationship\nResource Preference: Time/Energy → Skills → Money → Emotional presence\nImpact Scale: Individual → Group → Community → Society\n\n3. Personal Gifts (What You Bring)\n\nCreative Capacities: Visual, written, musical, crafting abilities\nInterpersonal Strengths: Listening, teaching, encouraging, connecting\nPractical Skills: Cooking, fixing, organizing, technical knowledge\nPhysical Abilities: Movement, touch, strength, endurance\n\n4. Motivational Drivers (Why You Give)\n\nValue Orientation: Environmental, social justice, spiritual, educational\nGrowth Edges: Comfort zones you're ready to expand\nPreferred Emotions: The feelings you most want to experience/share\n\nStealth Assessment Approach\nRather than asking 50 questions, we can use research-backed proxy questions:\nMedia Preferences as Identity Markers\nResearch shows media choices correlate strongly with personality traits and values. Questions like:\n\n\"What TV show character would you most enjoy having as a neighbor?\" (reveals interpersonal style)\n\"What kind of stories make you tear up?\" (reveals emotional triggers)\n\nChoice Scenarios\n\n\"You have $50 and two hours. Which would make you happiest:\na) Treating a stranger to lunch and conversation\nb) Buying art supplies for a children's shelter\nc) Planting trees in a neglected neighborhood\nd) Teaching someone a skill you know well\"\n\nVisual Selection\nShow images representing different kindness styles and ask which feels most appealing:\n\nA person anonymously leaving a gift (stealth giver)\nPeople working together on a community project (collaborative builder)\nOne person intently listening to another (empathic supporter)\n\nImplementation Strategy: The 5-Question Profiler\nFor the simplest yet effective implementation, we could use just 5 high-leverage questions:\n\nThe \"Causes Compass\" - \"Which issue would pull you out of bed on a Saturday morning?\"\n(reveals value orientation)\nThe \"Gift Response\" - \"When someone last helped you, what gesture meant the most?\"\n(reveals love language/reciprocity style, informed by Chapman's research)\nThe \"Weekend Snapshot\" - \"What activity makes you lose track of time?\"\n(reveals skill domains and flow states)\nThe \"Hardship Response\" - \"When you see someone struggling, your first instinct is to...\"\n(reveals kindness style)\nThe \"Growth Edge\" - \"Right now in your life, what feels most true?\"\n(reveals current life context and development needs)\n\nEach question would have 4-6 visual or text options, creating enough combinations to generate surprisingly personalized results without overwhelming users.\nThe Matching Algorithm\nThe system would match profile patterns to kindness acts tagged with compatible dimensions:\nProfile Pattern: Urban dweller + Creative skills + Prefers anonymity + Environmental values\n↓\nKindness Matches:\n- Leave painted kindness rocks in neighborhood parks\n- Anonymously create small planters for apartment building common areas\n- Make upcycled gift bags with treats for essential workers\nWhat makes this approach powerful is that each suggestion feels specifically tailored to the person, aligning with both what gives them energy and what their current life context makes possible.\nWould you like me to develop any particular aspect of this framework further? I can expand on the research foundations, create the complete question set with answer options, or develop the categorization system for kindness acts.RetryBGcan you make a tree that will fall into each of the profile with some simple questions and a branch, it should have a simple clear answer like for this: \n* The \"Hardship Response\" - \"When you see someone struggling, your first instinct is to...\" (reveals kindness style)\n* It should give options so it can be answered quickly \nWe will be using an LLM to make the inference we just want to get to the activities quicklyEditEngineered decision tree mapping kindness profiles with quick questions.9sThe user is asking me to create a decision tree that will quickly categorize people into different kindness profiles based on a series of simple questions with clear answer options. They specifically mention \"The Hardship Response\" question as an example, and they want the questions to be simple with clear options for quick answers.\nThey also mention they'll be using an LLM to make inferences from these answers, so they want to focus on getting to the activity recommendations quickly rather than complex profiling.\nI'll create a decision tree that:\n\nUses simple, clear questions with multiple-choice answers\nBranches into different kindness profiles based on those answers\nIs efficient (doesn't ask too many questions)\nLeads to specific kindness activity recommendations\n\nLet me design this decision tree based on our previous discussions about kindness profiles.\nFirst, I'll identify the main kindness profiles we've discussed:\n\nThe Spontaneous Brightener (strangers, anonymity, brief interactions)\nThe Behind-the-Scenes Sustainer (community, anonymity, effort-based)\nThe Intimate Nurturer (close relationships, recognition, personal touch)\nThe Skill Gifter (various relationships, skill-based, teaching)\nThe Digital Supporter (online, semi-anonymous, emotional support)\n\nLet me add a few more to round out the diversity of profiles:\n6. The Community Builder (group-oriented, visible, organizing)\n7. The Practical Helper (task-oriented, direct, problem-solving)\n8. The Creative Giver (artistic expression, personalized, imaginative)\nNow I'll design a decision tree with 3-4 key branching questions that can efficiently categorize people into these profiles. Each question should have clear, distinct options.\nThe tree should start with the most differentiating question first, to create major branches, and then use subsequent questions to further refine the classification.\nOk, let me structure this as a tree diagram that could be implemented as a quick quiz or decision flow.Kindness Profile Decision Tree\nHere's a simple decision tree with clear multiple-choice questions that quickly classify someone into distinct kindness profiles:\nSTART\n│\n└── Q1: \"When you have free time to help others, would you prefer to:\"\n    ├── A) \"Help people directly, face-to-face\" → Branch 1\n    ├── B) \"Work behind the scenes without much recognition\" → Branch 2\n    └── C) \"Share my skills, knowledge or creativity\" → Branch 3\n    \nBranch 1: Direct Helpers\n│\n└── Q2: \"When you see someone struggling, your first instinct is to:\"\n    ├── A) \"Offer practical assistance with their problem\" → PRACTICAL HELPER\n    │   └── Activities: Fix things for neighbors, help someone move, carry groceries for elderly\n    │\n    ├── B) \"Provide emotional support and listen\" → EMPATHIC SUPPORTER\n    │   └── Activities: Visit lonely seniors, be a listening ear at work, comfort someone grieving\n    │\n    └── C) \"Bring people together to solve issues\" → COMMUNITY CONNECTOR\n        └── Activities: Organize neighborhood cleanups, create support groups, host gatherings\n\nBranch 2: Behind-the-Scenes\n│\n└── Q2: \"Which approach feels most comfortable to you:\"\n    ├── A) \"Leaving anonymous gifts or help\" → SECRET GIVER\n    │   └── Activities: Pay for next person's coffee, leave encouraging notes, hide money in library books\n    │\n    ├── B) \"Creating systems or spaces that help many people\" → ENVIRONMENT ENHANCER\n    │   └── Activities: Clean public spaces, maintain community gardens, organize supply closets\n    │\n    └── C) \"Supporting existing efforts without being the face of them\" → QUIET SUPPORTER\n        └── Activities: Back-office volunteering, donation sorting, behind-the-scenes event help\n\nBranch 3: Skill & Creativity Sharers\n│\n└── Q2: \"What kind of contribution would you most enjoy sharing:\"\n    ├── A) \"Teaching others something I know well\" → KNOWLEDGE SHARER\n    │   └── Activities: Tutoring, skill workshops, creating how-to guides\n    │\n    ├── B) \"Creating something beautiful or useful\" → CREATIVE MAKER\n    │   └── Activities: Handmade gifts, artistic installations, personalized creations\n    │\n    └── C) \"Using digital/technical skills to help\" → DIGITAL HELPER\n        └── Activities: Help with technology problems, create online resources, digital volunteering\nQuick Implementation Version\nFor an even faster implementation with just 2 questions total:\nQ1: \"Which approach to helping others feels most natural to you?\"\nA) \"Direct interaction with people\" (PEOPLE-ORIENTED)\nB) \"Working with tasks or things\" (TASK-ORIENTED)\nC) \"Sharing what I know or create\" (SKILL-ORIENTED)\n\nQ2-A: [If PEOPLE-ORIENTED] \"Do you prefer to help:\"\nA) \"Close relationships (family/friends)\" → INTIMATE NURTURER\n   Activities: Cook special meals, give massages, personalized care\nB) \"Your community or group\" → COMMUNITY BUILDER\n   Activities: Organize events, facilitate connections, create gatherings\nC) \"Strangers or those in need\" → COMFORT GIVER\n   Activities: Homeless outreach, crisis support, hospital visits\n\nQ2-B: [If TASK-ORIENTED] \"Do you prefer your help to be:\"\nA) \"Visible and recognized\" → VISIBLE HELPER\n   Activities: Volunteer coordination, public service, leadership roles\nB) \"Anonymous or behind-the-scenes\" → SECRET SUPPORTER\n   Activities: Anonymous donations, preparation work, quiet service\nC) \"Solving specific problems\" → PRACTICAL FIXER\n   Activities: Repairs for neighbors, tech support, organizing spaces\n\nQ2-C: [If SKILL-ORIENTED] \"How do you prefer to share your abilities?\"\nA) \"Teaching or mentoring others\" → KNOWLEDGE SHARER\n   Activities: Tutoring, workshops, skill-sharing sessions\nB) \"Creating things for others\" → CREATIVE GIFTER\n   Activities: Handmade presents, baking, artistic creations\nC) \"Digital or remote assistance\" → TECH SUPPORTER\n   Activities: Website help, online resources, virtual assistance\nEach profile can be connected to a specific set of 5-10 kindness activities that align with that personality type, making it easy to quickly provide targeted suggestions.RetryBGcan you infer my vision and goals and project description and then describe the ideal way to implement the project?EditDecoded vision for personalized, meaningful random kindness platform.7sBased on our conversation so far and the document you shared, I can infer your vision, goals, and project description for this \"Random Acts of Kindness\" platform. Let me analyze this information:\nYour vision appears to be creating a platform that:\n\nHelps people identify sources of meaning and connection in their lives (influenced by Joe Edelman's work)\nMatches people with random acts of kindness that will energize them rather than drain them\nMakes kindness more accessible and personalized\nHelps people discover their \"gifts\" that they might not recognize as valuable\n\nYour project goals seem to include:\n\nCreating a profiling system that efficiently identifies what kinds of acts of kindness would resonate with different individuals\nBuilding a lightweight application/platform where people can create anonymous accounts\nMaking the profiling process quick and non-intrusive (not too many questions)\nUsing smart, proxy questions that reveal multiple dimensions of a person's preferences\nConnecting people to kindness acts that align with their personality, context, and gifts\n\nThe project description seems to be:\nA web-based platform called \"Kindness Kiwi\" (mentioned in your document) that uses a streamlined profiling approach to match users with personalized random acts of kindness suggestions. The platform would allow anonymous accounts, use a minimal set of questions to create kindness personality profiles, and then suggest specific acts that align with users' natural inclinations, contexts, and abilities.\nNow, let me describe what I believe would be the ideal implementation of this project:Kindness Kiwi: Implementation Vision\nFrom our conversations and the document you shared, I see you're creating a platform that matches people with energizing acts of kindness based on their unique personality, context, and hidden gifts. You want something lightweight with minimal questions that still provides highly personalized recommendations.\nThe Vision I'm Seeing\nYou're creating something like a \"kindness matchmaking service\" that helps people discover meaningful ways to give that align with who they truly are - a platform that feels like it \"gets you\" without requiring a lengthy questionnaire.\nIdeal Implementation\n1.

I can elaborate on any aspect of this implementation plan if needed.RetryJoe’s prompt\tYou are a meaning assistant, helping a user articulate their \"source of meaning\". You'll provide \"values cards\" that highlight what the user finds meaningful, using a specific function for these cards. Your larger goal is to help the user understand their feelings and clarify who they apastedBGyeah, sounds great, although the 2 question and profiles seems to miss some richness that is important from the research - can you review and then let's make a first prototype that we can do simply by creating an system prompt for an LLM to guide someone through the process by modifiyng joe edelman's prompt here:EditAdapted Edelman's prompt to craft kindness profiling system8sI'm being asked to create a prototype system prompt for an LLM (like myself) that would guide someone through a process of identifying meaningful acts of kindness that align with their personality, values, and hidden gifts. I need to modify Joe Edelman's prompt that was shared in the document to fit this new purpose.\nLet me analyze Joe Edelman's prompt first to understand its structure and approach:\n\nIt focuses on helping users articulate their \"source of meaning\" through \"values cards\"\nIt follows a specific dialogue flow:\n\nStart with a personal story, emotion, role model, or difficult choice\nZoom in on the \"source of meaning\"\nGather \"attention policies\" (what the person pays attention to)\nVerify the guess and then submit a values card\n\n\nIt has specific instructions for the tone and approach:\n\nSpeak like a close friend\nDon't flatter the user\nDon't use technical terms\nSpeak as if you can relate\nBe conversational\nNever show the description of the card to the user\n\n\nIt explains how to \"zoom in\" on sources of meaning from goals, feelings, or moral principles\nIt provides guidance on how to write \"attention policies\" that capture sources of meaning\n\nNow, I need to adapt this approach for our kindness profiling system, keeping in mind:\n\nThe research on acts of kindness\nThe profiling factors we've identified\nThe desire for a lightweight but rich experience\nThe goal of matching people with kindness acts that make them \"come alive\"\n\nLet me create a modified system prompt that guides an LLM to facilitate this process:Kindness Kiwi: LLM-Guided Personalization System\nAfter reviewing Joe Edelman's \"sources of meaning\" prompt alongside our previous work, I can see a powerful implementation approach that combines the best of both. Here's how I'd create the first prototype:\nSystem Prompt for Kindness Matching LLM\nYou are Kindness Kiwi, an assistant that helps people discover meaningful acts of kindness aligned with their unique personality and gifts. Your goal is to identify what makes someone \"come alive\" and match them with kindness acts that will energize rather than drain them.\n\nYour dialogue should follow these stages:\n1. Start with a personal story about kindness (given or received), or a moment that made them feel alive and engaged, or a difficult choice they face.\n2. Zoom in on their \"kindness personality\" using the techniques below.\n3. Ask questions to identify their key profile dimensions across: \n   - Relationship context (who they connect with)\n   - Expression style (how they prefer to give)\n   - Personal gifts (what they uniquely offer)\n   - Impact preferences (what change they want to see)\n4. When you've gathered enough information, present their kindness profile and 3-5 personalized acts of kindness.\n\nIn this process:\n* DO speak as if you were a supportive friend: warm, curious, and personal.\n* DON'T use technical terms like \"profile dimensions\" or \"kindness taxonomy.\"\n* DO relate and share examples: \"That reminds me of someone who...\"\n* DON'T ask multiple questions at once. Keep the conversation flowing naturally.\n* DO help them discover hidden gifts they might not recognize in themselves.\n\nZOOMING IN TECHNIQUES:\n\nIf they share a story about giving:\n* What about that experience felt most energizing or meaningful?\n* What specifically did you notice or pay attention to?\n* When have you felt similarly alive or engaged in other contexts?\n\nIf they share a difficult choice:\n* What kind of impact would you hope to have in either scenario?\n* What feels most authentic to who you really are?\n* What potential for connection or expression calls to you?\n\nIf they share a frustration:\n* What way of contributing feels blocked right now?\n* What would feel most liberating or energizing to you?\n* What impact do you wish you could have?\n\nGATHERING PROFILE DIMENSIONS:\n\nFor Relationship Context:\n* Ask about meaningful relationships in their life\n* Explore where they feel most comfortable (family, community, strangers)\n* Identify whether they prefer one-to-one or group contexts\n\nFor Expression Style:\n* Explore preferences for visibility (anonymous vs. recognized)\n* Ask about comfort with direct vs. indirect impact\n* Identify spontaneity vs. planning preferences\n\nFor Personal Gifts:\n* Look for creative abilities they mention\n* Note practical skills they reference\n* Identify emotional strengths they demonstrate\n\nFor Impact Preferences:\n* What change do they most want to see in the world?\n* What scale feels most meaningful (individual, community, society)?\n* What emotional outcome feels most important to them?\n\nPRESENTING KINDNESS MATCHES:\n\nOnce you've identified their profile, share:\n1. A warm, personalized description of their \"Kindness Personality\"\n2. 3-5 specific acts of kindness that align with their profile\n3. A brief explanation of why each act might be particularly meaningful for them\n\nEach suggested act should be:\n* Specific and actionable\n* Aligned with their available resources\n* Connected to what makes them \"come alive\"\n* Varied in scope and context\n\nAlways invite their feedback on the suggestions, and offer to adjust if needed.\nImplementation Approach\n\nInitial Deployment: Create a simple web interface where users can chat with this LLM system directly.\nData Collection Phase: Use these conversations to:\n\nCollect common kindness profile patterns\nGather feedback on which suggestions resonate most\nBuild a database of effective kindness acts by profile\n\n\nIteration: Refine the system prompt based on user feedback, emphasizing:\n\nWhich questions yield the most useful insights\nWhich kindness suggestions get the most positive response\nHow to make the process feel more conversational and natural\n\n\nStreamlining: After sufficient data collection, create a more structured flow with:\n\nOptional story sharing for those who want deeper personalization\nQuick-path option with 2-3 key questions for those wanting immediate suggestions\nSaved profiles for returning users\n\n\n\nWhat makes this approach powerful is that it combines the rich, narrative-based exploration of Joe Edelman's meaning-finding approach with our systematic kindness profiling framework - all while keeping the experience conversational and engaging.\nWould you like me to make any adjustments to this prototype system prompt or implementation approach?RetryBGi like this although i think it should be more relaxed and fun, what's a more kiwi nonchalant way to talk about a \"kindness personality\" persona? probably not \nAlso even with the bot perhaps we can have a balance between multiple choice questions a tree direction and we probably need an example of the kindness personality and the variables available within it \nReview my changes and think of the goals and reasoning behind them and find other aligned ways to improve the prompt, tell me what you're doing and why and then update the promptEditRefined kindness persona approach with playful, conversational strategy6sThe user is asking me to make the kindness personality concept more relaxed, fun, and \"kiwi nonchalant\" in tone. They're also suggesting we balance between multiple choice questions and a conversational tree direction. They want examples of kindness personalities and the variables within them.\nLet me reflect on these requests and consider how to improve the prompt:\n\nMore relaxed and fun tone: The current tone might be a bit formal and structured. I should make it more casual, playful, and approachable - something that feels like chatting with a friendly guide rather than taking a personality assessment.\nKiwi nonchalant way: This suggests a laid-back, unpretentious, friendly approach. Kiwi could refer to New Zealand culture which is known for being down-to-earth, or it could be referencing the \"Kindness Kiwi\" name of the project.\nBalance between multiple choice and conversation: Currently the prompt is heavily conversation-based. Adding some specific multiple choice questions would make it easier to navigate while maintaining the rich conversational exploration.\nExamples of kindness personalities: We need to provide concrete examples of the kindness personalities with their key variables, so the LLM has clear archetypes to match users with.\n\nLet me update the prompt with these considerations in mind:\n\nI'll make the tone more casual, playful and fun\nI'll create more \"kiwi nonchalant\" language around kindness personalities\nI'll add specific examples of multiple choice questions to balance with conversation\nI'll include examples of kindness personalities with their variables\n\nHere's how I'll phrase my response to the user:Making Kindness Kiwi More Playful and Approachable\nYou're absolutely right! The current prompt feels a bit too structured and formal. For a kindness-matching service, we need something more relaxed and fun - more \"kiwi\" in spirit!\nWhat I'm Changing and Why:\n\nTone Shift: Moving from \"kindness personality\" to more playful concepts like \"kindness flavor\" or \"kindness vibe\" - this feels less like a clinical assessment and more like discovering something fun about yourself\nAdding Choice-Based Elements: Including some fun multiple-choice questions within the conversational flow to provide structure without losing depth\nIncluding Concrete Examples: Adding example \"kindness flavors\" so the system has clear archetypes to match people with\nMore Playful Language: Replacing formal terms with more conversational, friendly language throughout\n\nUpdated Kindness Kiwi Prompt:\nYou're Kindness Kiwi, a chill guide helping people discover their own unique \"kindness flavor\" - the specific types of kind acts that would actually feel energizing and fun for them, not draining or awkward.\n\nYour vibe is casual, warm, and a bit playful - like a friend having a relaxed chat over coffee, not a formal assessment.\n\nYOUR FLOW:\n1. Start super casual - ask about a time they did something nice that felt good, or maybe when someone did something for them that really hit right.\n\n2. Get curious about what made that experience click for them. What part of it lit them up? Was it seeing someone's reaction? The creative process? The sneaky anonymous part?\n\n3. Sprinkle in some fun either/or questions to help narrow down their kindness flavor, like:\n   \"Quick gut check - would you rather: \n   A) Make something cool that brightens someone's day, or \n   B) Be there to really listen when someone needs to talk?\"\n\n4. Once you've got a feel for their vibe, share their \"kindness flavor\" and some specific acts that might feel surprisingly right for them.\n\nKINDNESS FLAVORS (Examples to match people with):\n\n🌱 The Stealth Giver\n* Loves: Anonymous acts, little surprises, the mystery of it all\n* Energized by: Doing good without anyone knowing it was them\n* Perfect acts: Secret coffee purchases, hidden encouraging notes, ninja gifting\n\n🔆 The Connector\n* Loves: Bringing people together, creating moments\n* Energized by: Seeing new relationships form or existing ones deepen\n* Perfect acts: Introducing people with shared interests, hosting tiny gatherings, creating conversation opportunities\n\n🛠️ The Practical Helper\n* Loves: Solving tangible problems, using their hands or skills\n* Energized by: Seeing something broken become fixed or functional\n* Perfect acts: Fixing things for others, sharing practical knowledge, organizing spaces\n\n🎨 The Creative Sprinkler\n* Loves: Making things that spark joy or wonder\n* Energized by: The process of creating and then sharing that creation\n* Perfect acts: Handmade gifts, sidewalk art, personalized playlists\n\n🌊 The Deep Diver\n* Loves: Authentic connection, emotional support\n* Energized by: Being truly present with others in meaningful moments\n* Perfect acts: Dedicated listening time, checking in during hard times, remembering important details\n\nQUESTIONS TO SPRINKLE IN:\n\nFor figuring out their social comfort zone:\n\"Where do you feel most in your element - with your inner circle, your wider community, or with complete strangers?\"\n\nFor discovering their visibility preference:\n\"Would you rather: A) Get a heartfelt thank you, or B) Know you helped but nobody knows it was you?\"\n\nFor uncovering their natural gifts:\n\"Friends or family would probably say you're really good at...\" (multiple choice with options like \"listening,\" \"making things,\" \"solving problems,\" \"organizing,\" \"coming up with ideas\")\n\nFor identifying impact style:\n\"What feels more satisfying: A) Making one person's day significantly better, or B) Creating a small positive ripple for lots of people?\"\n\nWhen you suggest kindness acts, make them super specific and doable, not generic. Like instead of \"help neighbors,\" suggest \"offer to water plants for a neighbor going on vacation.\"\n\nKeep everything conversational, light, and curious - like you're discovering this together, not delivering an assessment. Think of yourself as a kindness matchmaker, not a test administrator!\nThis updated prompt feels much more playful and engaging. The concept of \"kindness flavors\" rather than \"personalities\" makes it feel more like a fun discovery than a formal assessment. The example flavors give clear archetypes while the multiple-choice questions provide structure without sacrificing depth.\nWould you like me to adjust anything else about this approach?RetryBGok, going a bit far with the playful, maybe we should describe the different factors earlier ? I liked some of the content and ideas here: Kindness Profiling System: A Synthesized Approach\nLooking at our previous work alongside this new information, I see a beautiful opportunity to create something like a \"kindness matchmaking service\" - connecting people with acts that will feel like meeting an old friend rather than an awkward blind date.\nCore Framework: The Kindness Profile Matrix\nCombining our previous factors with the research mentioned in your document, I've created this integrated framework:\n1. Personal Context (Who & Where You Are)\n* Relationship Web: Family proximity, partnership status, friendship circles\n* Environmental Setting: Urban/suburban/rural, mobility access, workspace type\n* Temporal Patterns: Available time pockets, energy patterns, spontaneity comfort\n2. Giving Expression (How You Give)\n* Visibility Spectrum: Anonymous → Recognized\n* Interaction Depth: Brief encounter → Sustained relationship\n* Resource Preference: Time/Energy → Skills → Money → Emotional presence\n* Impact Scale: Individual → Group → Community → Society\n3. Personal Gifts (What You Bring)\n* Creative Capacities: Visual, written, musical, crafting abilities\n* Interpersonal Strengths: Listening, teaching, encouraging, connecting\n* Practical Skills: Cooking, fixing, organizing, technical knowledge\n* Physical Abilities: Movement, touch, strength, endurance\n4. Motivational Drivers (Why You Give)\n* Value Orientation: Environmental, social justice, spiritual, educational\n* Growth Edges: Comfort zones you're ready to expand\n* Preferred Emotions: The feelings you most want to experience/share\nStealth Assessment Approach\nRather than asking 50 questions, we can use research-backed proxy questions:\nMedia Preferences as Identity Markers\nResearch shows media choices correlate strongly with personality traits and values. Questions like:\n* \"What TV show character would you most enjoy having as a neighbor?\" (reveals interpersonal style)\n* \"What kind of stories make you tear up?\" (reveals emotional triggers)\nChoice Scenarios\n* \"You have $50 and two hours. Which would make you happiest: a) Treating a stranger to lunch and conversation b) Buying art supplies for a children's shelter c) Planting trees in a neglected neighborhood d) Teaching someone a skill you know well\"\nVisual Selection\nShow images representing different kindness styles and ask which feels most appealing:\n* A person anonymously leaving a gift (stealth giver)\n* People working together on a community project (collaborative builder)\n* One person intently listening to another (empathic supporter)\nImplementation Strategy: The 5-Question Profiler\nFor the simplest yet effective implementation, we could use just 5 high-leverage questions:\n1. The \"Causes Compass\" - \"Which issue would pull you out of bed on a Saturday morning?\" (reveals value orientation)\n2. The \"Gift Response\" - \"When someone last helped you, what gesture meant the most?\" (reveals love language/reciprocity style, informed by Chapman's research)\n3. The \"Weekend Snapshot\" - \"What activity makes you lose track of time?\" (reveals skill domains and flow states)\n4. The \"Hardship Response\" - \"When you see someone struggling, your first instinct is to...\" (reveals kindness style)\n5. The \"Growth Edge\" - \"Right now in your life, what feels most true?\" (reveals current life context and development needs)\nEach question would have 4-6 visual or text options, creating enough combinations to generate surprisingly personalized results without overwhelming users.Especially the choice scenarios and tv character alignments  and i'd like to find away to get more of the who where how what and why factors into the promptEditRefined kindness profiling prompt to balance structure and conversation.5sI see what you're looking for - we need to find a middle ground between the rigorous framework from the \"Kindness Profile Matrix\" and the more conversational approach. The current prompt went too far in the playful direction and lost some of the depth and structure of the profiling system.\nLet's create a revised prompt that:\n\nIntroduces the key profiling dimensions early (Who & Where, How You Give, What You Bring, Why You Give)\nMaintains a friendly but not overly playful tone\nIncorporates the high-leverage questions and choice scenarios from our previous work\nCreates a clearer structure for the LLM to follow when profiling someone\nBalances tree-based direction (multiple choice) with open-ended exploration\n\nI'll redraft the prompt to incorporate these elements while still keeping it conversational and accessible. I'll make sure to include the great proxy questions like media preferences and choice scenarios, which provide depth without feeling like an assessment.Balanced Kindness Profiler Prompt\nI understand you want to find that sweet spot between rigorous profiling and conversational warmth. The previous approach went too far into playfulness, while we need to maintain the depth of our framework. Here's a revised prompt that introduces the profiling dimensions early and balances structure with conversation:\nYou are Kindness Kiwi, a guide helping people discover kindness activities that align with who they are and what brings them alive. Your goal is to match people with acts of kindness that will feel energizing and meaningful rather than draining or obligatory.\n\nFRAMEWORK:\nYou'll help identify their kindness profile across four key dimensions:\n\n1. Personal Context (Who & Where You Are)\n   - Relationships available to them\n   - Environmental setting (urban/rural, etc.)\n   - Available time and energy patterns\n\n2. Giving Expression (How You Give)\n   - Visibility preference (anonymous to recognized)\n   - Interaction depth (brief to sustained)\n   - Resource type (time, skills, money, presence)\n   - Impact scale (individual to society)\n\n3. Personal Gifts (What You Bring)\n   - Creative abilities\n   - Interpersonal strengths\n   - Practical skills\n   - Physical capabilities\n\n4. Motivational Drivers (Why You Give)\n   - Value orientation\n   - Growth edges\n   - Emotional experiences sought\n\nCONVERSATION FLOW:\n1. Begin with a warm welcome and a story prompt: \"Tell me about a time when you did something kind that felt especially good, or when someone did something for you that really resonated.\"\n\n2. After their initial story, use a mix of high-leverage questions and choice scenarios to explore their profile:\n\n   For Personal Context:\n   - \"Who are the people in your life you feel most connected to?\" (reveals relationship web)\n   - \"Would you describe your daily environment as more urban, suburban, or rural?\" (reveals setting)\n   - \"When during your week do you typically have pockets of time available?\" (reveals temporal patterns)\n\n   For Giving Expression:\n   - Choice Scenario: \"You have $50 and two hours free. Would you prefer: \n     a) Taking someone struggling to lunch and listening to them\n     b) Anonymously paying for a stranger's groceries\n     c) Teaching a skill you have to someone who wants to learn\n     d) Contributing to a community garden project\"\n\n   For Personal Gifts:\n   - Media-Based Question: \"What TV show character would you most enjoy having as a neighbor, and why?\" (reveals interpersonal style)\n   - \"What activity makes you lose track of time when you're doing it?\" (reveals flow state activities)\n   - \"What do friends often ask your help with?\" (reveals recognized skills)\n\n   For Motivational Drivers:\n   - \"The Causes Compass\": \"Which issue would most likely get you out of bed on a Saturday morning to help with?\"\n   - \"The Hardship Response\": \"When you see someone struggling, your first instinct is to...\"\n   - \"Right now in your life, what feels most meaningful to you?\"\n\n3. After gathering insights, share their \"kindness profile\" - a brief description of their natural kindness style followed by 5-7 specific acts that would align with their profile.\n\nSTYLE GUIDELINES:\n- Keep your tone warm and conversational, but not overly cute or playful\n- Ask one question at a time, following the natural flow of conversation\n- Use a mix of open-ended questions and choice scenarios\n- Acknowledge and incorporate their stories and responses\n- Make kindness suggestions specific and actionable\n\nKINDNESS PROFILES:\nUse these as starting templates, but customize based on the individual's unique responses:\n\n\"The Quiet Supporter\" - Values behind-the-scenes help, practical assistance, might prefer anonymity\n\"The Connection Creator\" - Values bringing people together, building relationships, creating moments\n\"The Skills Sharer\" - Values teaching, mentoring, passing on knowledge and abilities\n\"The Moment Maker\" - Values creating special experiences, celebrations, marking occasions\n\"The Deep Listener\" - Values emotional presence, bearing witness, holding space for others\n\"The Practical Helper\" - Values tangible assistance, solving problems, improving situations\n\"The Creative Gifter\" - Values making and sharing creative works that brighten others' lives\n\nAlways conclude by checking if the kindness profile and suggested activities resonate with them, and offer to refine if needed.\nThe key improvements in this version:\n\nFramework Introduction: I've front-loaded the key dimensions so the LLM understands the full scope before beginning the conversation\nBalanced Questions: I've included both the tree-based multiple choice questions and more open-ended exploration questions\nResearch-Backed Techniques: I've preserved the media preferences and choice scenarios that provide deep insights without feeling like a survey\nStructured Yet Flexible Flow: The prompt gives clear direction while allowing natural conversation development\nRealistic Tone: I've adjusted the tone to be warm and friendly without going overboard on playfulness\n\nThis approach should help your users discover their natural kindness style while still maintaining the depth and research foundation of the original framework. Would you like me to adjust anything further?Okay. This is great. I wanted to also take this and turn it into a sort of, Application or I can use something very simple to create a way for people to log in create anonymous accounts to somehow give information to help pro profile themselves according to the different kinds of random acts of kindness. And I'm wondering maybe we should we should first actually take the steps to figure out how to profile, the kinds of actions that people can take so that we can then identify which ones they'll be most likely to do, and then from there, we can then, offer them some suggestions. And so like, it would also, it would be kinda good to know, like, what are the opportunities they have for it. So do they are they living close to their parents? Are they married? Do they have children? Like, what are their relationships? And do they live in a city? Do are they in a rural place? Are they creative? Can they draw? Do they like saying? Like, what do they have that could be considered a gift? Maybe gifts that they don't even know are gifts that they actually have that are gifts how can I think about this systematically so that we can come up with a good way to profile and give people the opportunity to do a random act of kindness that would make them really excited and feel proud of themselves and help them come alive?EditThis is a fantastic direction for evolving Kindness Kiwi into a more personalized application! Creating a systematic profiling approach will help match people with kindness acts that truly resonate with them. Let me outline a structured framework for this:\nA Systematic Approach to Kindness Profiling\n1. Core Dimensions for Kindness Profiling\nWe can think of kindness opportunities along several key dimensions:\nA. Personal Context & Resources\n\nRelational Context\n\nFamily proximity (parents, siblings, extended family)\nPartnership status (single, partnered, married)\nParental status (children, their ages)\nSocial circles (close friends, acquaintances, community involvement)\n\n\nEnvironmental Context\n\nLiving situation (urban, suburban, rural)\nMobility (car access, public transit, walking distance to community)\nWorkspace (office, remote, mixed)\nCommunity resources (parks, libraries, community centers)\n\n\nTime & Energy Resources\n\nAvailable time pockets (15 minutes, 1 hour, half day, etc.)\nEnergy patterns (morning person, night owl)\nScheduling flexibility\nSpontaneity comfort level\n\n\n\nB. Personal Gifts & Strengths\n\nCreative Abilities\n\nVisual arts (drawing, painting, photography)\nWriting (poetry, stories, letters)\nMusic (singing, playing instruments)\nCrafting (sewing, knitting, woodworking)\n\n\nInterpersonal Strengths\n\nListening skills\nConversational abilities\nEmpathic presence\nTeaching/mentoring capacity\n\n\nPractical Skills\n\nCooking/baking\nGardening/plant care\nTechnology assistance\nRepair/building abilities\nOrganization skills\n\n\n\nC. Value & Motivation Dimensions\n\nPreferred Impact Style\n\nDirect vs. anonymous giving\nOne-to-one vs. community-oriented\nImmediate vs. sustained impact\nPractical vs. emotional/spiritual support\n\n\nPersonal Growth Edges\n\nComfort with vulnerability\nDesire to expand social connections\nInterest in new skills development\nCourage to try new interactions\n\n\nValue Orientation\n\nEnvironmental consciousness\nSocial justice awareness\nCultural preservation\nSpiritual/mindfulness practice\n\n\n\n2. Profiling Implementation Approach\nTo create a practical application, we could implement this as:\n\nProgressive Questionnaire\n\nBegin with a short, engaging questionnaire (5-7 questions)\nAllow users to \"unlock\" additional profiling for more personalized suggestions\nUse friendly, conversational language\n\n\nExample Questions\n\n\"When you have 15 free minutes, you're most likely to...\" (reveals time use preferences)\n\"Complete this sentence: People often tell me I'm good at...\" (reveals hidden gifts)\n\"Which would make you smile more: A) A heartfelt thank you note, B) Seeing someone use something you created, C) Knowing you made someone's day easier\" (reveals value orientation)\n\n\nVisual Elements\n\nInstead of a clinical survey, use visual choice cards\nProgress visualization (growing kiwi plant as profile develops)\nCategories represented by friendly icons\n\n\n\n3. Kindness Act Matching System\nOnce profiled, the system could categorize kindness acts by:\n\nEffort Level\n\nQuick (5-15 minutes)\nMedium (30-60 minutes)\nDeeper (multi-hour or ongoing)\n\n\nContext Categories\n\nHome-based\nNeighborhood/community\nWorkplace/school\nOnline/digital\nNature/outdoor\n\n\nGift Utilization\n\nCreating (using artistic/making skills)\nSupporting (using interpersonal skills)\nSharing knowledge (using expertise)\nPhysical help (using practical skills)\n\n\nSurprise Factor\n\nDirect (expected kindness)\nUnexpected (surprise kindness)\nAnonymous (mystery kindness)\n\n\n\n4. Technical Implementation Options (MVP)\nFor a simple starter implementation:\n\nNo-Code/Low-Code Options\n\nTypeform + Airtable (for questionnaire and response categorization)\nBubble.io (for more interactive experience)\nGlide (to create a simple app from a spreadsheet)\n\n\nAuthentication\n\nUse anonymous IDs (similar to Reddit's approach)\nAllow optional email signup for progress tracking\nCould use \"magic links\" instead of passwords\n\n\nProfile Storage\n\nKeep profiles locally in browser storage for simplest implementation\nProvide option to save profile for returning users\nUse unique URL sharing for anonymous profiles\n\n\n\n5. Practical Next Steps\n\nCreate a condensed \"kindness profile\" questionnaire with 10-15 key questions\nCategorize 30-50 kindness acts by the dimensions above\nBuild a simple matching algorithm (even in spreadsheet form)\nTest with a small group to refine the matching quality\nImplement as a simple web tool connected to your existing site\n\nWould you like me to develop any specific piece of this framework further? I could:\n\nCreate the actual profiling questionnaire\nDevelop a taxonomy of kindness acts categorized by these dimensions\nDesign a simple algorithm for matching profiles to acts\nOutline specific technical implementation details for your preferred platform\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that it discovers not just what kindness acts would resonate with someone, but actually helps people discover gifts they might not even recognize in themselves - creating a double layer of positive self-discovery.RetryBGOkay. So, is there any research for random acts of kindness that we can leverage for this profile or what are some adjacent ideas that we can be leveraging And to, take advantage of other types of research. I wanna be a little more systematic and thoughtful about this. So, and also, I don't want to ask them, too many questions. So first, let's figure out what the, setup maybe. And then let's see if we can get a, Way to access that information in a straightforward way. For instance, I believe that if we were working directly with their LLM, we wouldn't have to do much at all because it would have enough context about them. Or if we got some information some other way. How about them? Yep. Thanks. What charities would you contribute to? Have you contributed to? Your favorite movies, like, Superhero favorite. More, like, VR. Something. You know, like, some of you got, what are other things like this where we can deduce a lot of information And that would help, like, profile demo.EditYou're absolutely right about being more systematic and using efficient profiling methods that don't overwhelm users. The key is to leverage existing research while finding clever proxy questions that reveal multiple dimensions of a person's preferences and values.\nResearch on Random Acts of Kindness\nSeveral research areas can inform our profiling approach:\n\nProsocial Behavior Research\n\nStudies by Lyubomirsky and Layous (2013) show that kindness activities boost well-being most when they:\n\nFit with the person's interests/values\nVary in type (preventing hedonic adaptation)\nInclude seeing the impact\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Five Love Languages\" Framework\n\nWhile originally for relationships, this well-known framework (Chapman) categorizes how people prefer to give and receive:\n\nWords of affirmation\nActs of service\nReceiving gifts\nQuality time\nPhysical touch\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Strengths Research (VIA Institute)\n\nThe 24 character strengths identified can predict kindness preferences\nPeople are more likely to engage in kindness acts that leverage their top strengths\n\n\nPersonality Research\n\nEven simplified personality dimensions (extraversion/introversion, etc.) correlate with kindness preferences\nExtraverts often prefer direct, interpersonal acts; introverts may prefer behind-the-scenes kindness\n\n\n\nProxy Questions and Stealth Assessment\nInstead of direct profiling, we can use clever proxy questions that reveal multiple dimensions:\n1. Media Preferences as Proxy Data\nExample Questions:\n\n\"What's the last movie/show that made you feel good?\" (reveals value orientation)\n\"Choose a fictional character you relate to\" (reveals personality traits)\n\nResearch Basis: Media psychology research shows strong correlations between preferences and personality traits (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003)\n2. Behavioral Choices\nExample Questions:\n\n\"You have an unexpected free afternoon. You most likely would...\" (reveals introversion/extraversion, creativity preferences)\n\"When you last gave a gift you were proud of, what made it special?\" (reveals love language and effort preferences)\n\nResearch Basis: Behavioral economics shows hypothetical choices reliably predict actual behavior patterns\n3. Reaction-Based Assessment\nExample Questions:\n\n\"Which of these headlines would make you stop scrolling?\" (reveals cause orientation)\n\"Which of these images feels most calming to you?\" (reveals aesthetic and environmental preferences)\n\nResearch Basis: Implicit association tests show quick reactions reveal underlying values\n4. LLM-Based Opportunity\nAs you mentioned, LLMs offer a unique opportunity. If users have access to ChatGPT or similar, we could:\n\nCreate a prompt that asks the LLM to analyze the user's chat history and provide:\n\nInferred personality traits\nDetected interests and values\nPotential kindness matches\n\n\nThen have users paste this simplified profile into our system\n\nExample prompt: \"Based on my conversation history, what types of random acts of kindness might align with my personality, interests, and values? Please provide a brief profile of my apparent strengths and preferences, and then suggest 3-5 kindness acts that would feel authentic to me.\"\nMinimalist Profiling Framework\nFor an MVP, we could use just 5-7 high-value questions:\n\n\"Which cause would you be most likely to volunteer for?\" (reveals value orientation)\n\nAnimal welfare\nChildren's education\nElder support\nEnvironmental protection\nCommunity arts\nCrisis support\n\n\n\"Which of these would make you feel most appreciated?\" (reveals reciprocity preference)\n\nA heartfelt note\nSomeone doing a task for you\nQuality time together\nA thoughtful gift\nPhysical support or assistance\n\n\n\"Which of these activities would you most enjoy doing on a weekend?\" (reveals personality and skill domains)\n\nCreating something with your hands\nExploring nature or a new place\nDeep conversations with friends\nLearning something new\nOrganizing or improving a space\n\n\n\"You notice someone having a hard day. Your first instinct would be to...\" (reveals kindness style)\n\nOffer a listening ear\nGive them space but check in later\nDo something practical to help\nShare an uplifting story or joke\nGive them a small gift or treat\n\n\n\"Which statement feels most true for you right now?\" (reveals growth edge)\n\n\"I'd like to feel more connected to my community\"\n\"I want to use my skills and talents more meaningfully\"\n\"I want to be more spontaneous and break routine\"\n\"I want to deepen my existing relationships\"\n\"I want to create more beauty or order in the world\"\n\n\n\nTechnical Implementation Ideas\nFor a lightweight but effective implementation:\n\nFirebase + Simple Web App\n\nAnonymous auth is built-in\nFree tier would handle an MVP easily\nCan store user preferences and match to curated kindness acts\n\n\nLLM-Enhanced Web Tool\n\nUser answers minimal questions\nCombined with a standardized LLM prompt for those who want deeper personalization\nBlend of manual and AI-driven matching\n\n\nProgressive Web App\n\nWorks offline\nCan send gentle reminders about kindness opportunities\nAllows for anonymous \"kindness journaling\"\n\n\n\nWould you like me to develop any of these specific approaches further? For instance, I could:\n\nCreate a complete set of the minimal profile questions with scoring guide\nDevelop a framework for categorizing kindness acts by these dimensions\nDesign a simple algorithm that shows how the matching would work\nCreate a technical specification for implementation\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that it feels like a fun exploration rather than a clinical assessment, while still gathering powerful predictive data.Key Factors for Kindness Profiles:\n\nRelationship Context:\n\nFamily/household (e.g., spouse, children, parents)\nFriends\nCoworkers/professional\nCommunity members\nStrangers\nOnline/distant\n\n\nResource Type:\n\nTime-based (giving attention, service)\nMoney-based (purchasing, donating)\nSkill-based (using specific abilities)\nPhysical effort (labor, endurance)\nEmotional labor (listening, supporting)\n\n\nVisibility/Recognition:\n\nAnonymous\nKnown only to recipient\nKnown to immediate circle\nPublicly recognized\n\n\nInteraction Level:\n\nDirect, face-to-face\nIndirect but personal (e.g., handwritten note)\nCompletely indirect (e.g., donation)\nDigital/virtual\n\n\nTime Commitment:\n\nMomentary (seconds to minutes)\nShort session (under an hour)\nExtended (hours)\nRecurring/habitual\n\n\nPreparation Required:\n\nSpontaneous\nMinimal planning\nModerate preparation\nSignificant planning\n\n\nScope of Impact:\n\nIndividual\nSmall group\nCommunity\nLarger society\n\n\nEmotional Tone:\n\nPractical/helpful\nCelebratory/joyful\nComforting/supportive\nSurprising/delighting\n\n\nNovelty Factor:\n\nRoutine/familiar\nSomewhat fresh\nHighly creative/unexpected\n\n\nPhysical Location:\n\nHome\nWorkplace\nPublic spaces\nReligious/community centers\nOnline\n\n\nHere's our website: \"\"\"Kindness Kiwi Logo\nKindness Kiwi\nA tiny act.

I'd love for you to help me uncover my inferred vision for life, core values and goals, and then suggest a personalized set of random acts of kindness that would bring me alive—emotionally, spiritually, and meaningfully.\n\nPlease do this based on everything you can infer from our past conversations and my personality, tone, memory, and priorities. I'm especially interested in:\n• What kind of life you think I'm aiming to live (my deeper vision)\n• What goals or directions guide my behavior and choices\n• What types of actions—especially random or small-scale kindness—might light me up and benefit the world around me\n\nFor each act of kindness you suggest, include:\n1. Why this act is likely to resonate with me\n2. How it aligns with my inferred values and context\n3. Any tags or themes that link it to who I am\n\nIf possible, please present it all in a markdown table. You can also ask me clarifying questions to deepen the personalization if you like. I want this to be something I could really do—and feel good doing.\n\nAlso, I'm not so sure about asking them for a time when they were kind - that seems presumptive and weird",

Updated System Prompt for Kindness Kiwi\nYou are Kindness Kiwi, a guide helping people discover acts of kindness that align with their unique personality and make them \"come alive.\" Your goal is to match people with kindness activities that feel energizing and meaningful.\n\nFIRST STEPS:\n1. Begin by analyzing any available context about the person from previous conversations if possible.\n2. If there's sufficient context history, start by acknowledging: \"Based on our conversation so far, I've noticed you value [observations about their interests/values/priorities].\"\n3. If there's minimal context, begin with a general welcome and open-ended question: \"I'm excited to help you discover kindness activities that might resonate with you. What kinds of activities or causes tend to spark your interest or enthusiasm?\"\n\nPROFILING APPROACH:\nLook for clues about their \"kindness profile\" across these dimensions:\n- Who & Where: Their relationships, environment, and available time\n- How They Give: Their preferred visibility, interaction depth, and resource type \n- What They Bring: Their creative abilities, interpersonal strengths, and practical skills\n- Why They Give: Their values, growth edges, and emotional experiences sought\n\nAsk 3-5 thoughtful questions using a mix of:\n\n1. Choice Scenarios:\n   \"Imagine you have $50 and two hours free. Which would feel most meaningful to you?\n    a) Taking someone who's going through a tough time to lunch\n    b) Anonymously paying for a stranger's groceries\n    c) Teaching someone a skill you have that they want to learn\n    d) Contributing to a community garden or improvement project\"\n\n2. Media-Based Questions:\n   \"What fictional character (from any show, movie, or book) do you find yourself relating to, and what quality about them do you admire?\"\n\n3. Value Clarification:\n   \"What social issue or cause tends to catch your attention or make you pause when you encounter it?\"\n\n4. Resource Assessment:\n   \"What's something friends or family often appreciate about you or come to you for?\"\n\nRECOMMENDATION STRUCTURE:\nOnce you've gathered sufficient insights, share:\n1. A brief description of their natural kindness style (2-3 sentences)\n2. 5-7 specific kindness acts that would align with their profile\n3. For each act, a brief explanation of why it might resonate with them\n\nKINDNESS PROFILES:\nCustomize based on the individual's responses, using these as starting templates:\n\n\"The Quiet Supporter\" - Values behind-the-scenes help, practical assistance\n\"The Connection Creator\" - Values bringing people together, building relationships\n\"The Skills Sharer\" - Values teaching, mentoring, passing on knowledge\n\"The Moment Maker\" - Values creating special experiences, celebrations\n\"The Deep Listener\" - Values emotional presence, bearing witness\n\"The Practical Helper\" - Values tangible assistance, solving problems\n\"The Creative Gifter\" - Values making and sharing creative works\n\nKINDNESS SUGGESTIONS:\nEnsure each suggestion is:\n- Specific and actionable (not generic like \"help others\")\n- Contextually appropriate to their life circumstances\n- Varied in scope and commitment level\n- Connected to their unique gifts and values\n- Genuinely likely to feel energizing rather than draining\n\nAlways conclude by checking if the suggested activities resonate with them, and invite them to share their experience with the Kindness Kiwi community.\nThis updated prompt removes the potentially presumptive question about past kindness, starts by leveraging existing contextual information when available, and maintains the effective profiling structure and kindness matching system from the original.\nI've also refined some of the questions to feel more conversational and less like an assessment, while still gathering the key information needed to make meaningful kindness recommendations.",
