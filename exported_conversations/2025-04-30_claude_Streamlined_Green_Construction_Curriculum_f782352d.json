Currently, modules 1 and 4 seem too connected; it's strange to have a module simply on sustainable construction materials. Does it make sense? Would it be something that could make jobs happen? We're working with Mosul Space, so there's a makerspace where things can be built and experimented with\nEdit\nReimagined module 4 to empower architects with climate-responsive design.\n7s\nI need to reconsider Module 4's focus and how it fits into the overall structure, particularly with architects in mind and avoiding overlap with Module 1. Let me think through this:\nCurrent issues:\nModules 1 and 4 seem too connected\nModule 4 on \"sustainable construction materials\" might not be distinctive enough\nNeed to ensure architects have a clear role/pathway\nNeed to leverage Mosul Space's makerspace capabilities\nNeed to ensure the module creates job opportunities\nLooking at the Iraqi Green Building Code and Salih's notes, I see potential for a more specialized focus for Module 4 that would:\nCreate clear differentiation from Module 1\nProvide specialized skills for architects\nUtilize makerspace capabilities\nCreate job opportunities\nPotential directions for Module 4:\nAdaptive Reuse & Heritage Building Renovation - Focus on applying green building principles to renovating existing structures, especially heritage buildings\nIntegrated Building System Design - Focus on the integration of all systems (thermal, solar, water) into cohesive architectural solutions\nDigital Design & Fabrication for Green Construction - Leverage the makerspace for digital design and fabrication of sustainable building components\nClimate-Responsive Architectural Design - Focus on advanced architectural design that responds to Iraq's climate\nOption 4 seems most aligned with architects' skills and interests while creating distinct value from Module 1. It would focus on design rather than assessment and would utilize the makerspace for creating architectural models and prototypes.\nModule 4 redefinition: Title: Climate-Responsive Architectural Design & Digital Fabrication Target Job Role: Sustainable Design Architect/Digital Fabrication Specialist\nThis would focus on the design process, computational design tools, and digital fabrication techniques for creating climate-responsive architectural solutions. It would leverage the makerspace capabilities while creating a clear career path for architects that's distinct from the other modules.\nRedefining Module 4 for Architects and Makerspace Integration\nYou've identified a key issue - the current Module 4 concept overlaps with Module 1 and may not create distinct job opportunities. With architects in mind and access to Mosul Space's makerspace, I recommend a complete redefinition of Module 4:\nRecommended Module 4 Redefinition\nNew Title: Climate-Responsive Architectural Design

market needs.\nRetry\nOutcome3: Description Improved business environment and participation of local MSMEs and investors in the construction sector. Output 3.1: Strengthened partnership between Iraqi public and private stakeholders to design and implement a green sustainable construction sector development strategy.\npasted\nBG\nwe can reduce the number of modules if needed, or increase them, critique what we have based on outcome 3 and my TOR I'm missing the sustainable heritage element, I think its important - what's an adaptation that accomplishes our goals and leverages what we have.\nEdit\nReimagined curriculum modules to integrate sustainable heritage design.\n9s\nLet me analyze the request and the context provided to formulate a response.\nThe user is asking me to review and potentially revise the module structure we've been designing based on:\nThe new information in Output 3 description (from paste.txt)\nThe missing sustainable heritage element, which the user considers important\nThe user's TOR (Terms of Reference) and the goals of the project\nLet me first analyze the Output 3 description to see how it aligns with our current module structure:\nOutput 3.3 seems most relevant to our curriculum development as it explicitly mentions:\nEmpowering local businesses, especially young entrepreneurs\nTraining in climate-smart solutions and innovative construction technologies\nAligning TVET programs with business needs\nBuilding capacity through coaching and mentoring\nOur current module structure:\nGreen Building Assessment & Site Planning\nSolar Energy Systems & Implementation\nThermal Performance & Indoor Environmental Quality\nClimate-Responsive Architectural Design & Digital Fabrication\nThe heritage element was mentioned as important but is currently not prominent in our structure. Looking at the original Module 4 in the curriculum overview, it was titled \"Heritage-Inspired Innovation—Study the Past, Build the Future\" and focused on leveraging Iraq's architectural heritage for sustainable innovation.\nI'm going to need to incorporate this heritage aspect more prominently while still maintaining the practical, job-focused orientation the user wants. Additionally, since Mosul Space has a makerspace component, we should leverage that for hands-on, practical activities.\nA few options to consider:\nRevise Module 4 to more strongly incorporate heritage elements while maintaining the digital fabrication component\nCreate a new module specifically for heritage architecture and sustainable renovation\nIncorporate heritage elements across all modules, with a stronger emphasis in Module 4\nI also need to consider whether our current number of modules is appropriate or if we should reduce or increase them based on the project goals in Output 3.\nLet me propose a revised structure that addresses these concerns.\nCritical Review of Module Structure and Heritage Integration\nAfter analyzing the provided information about Output 3.3 and considering your concerns about the sustainable heritage element, I'd like to propose some adjustments to our module framework.\nStrengths of Current Module Structure\nOur current modules align well with Output 3.3's focus on \"strengthened capacities of local businesses, particularly young entrepreneurs, for the integration of green and innovative practices.\" Each module creates distinct employment pathways while building specific technical competencies.\nKey Limitations to Address\nHeritage Integration: The sustainable heritage element is currently underrepresented despite its importance in Iraq's architectural context\nPractical Application: Need stronger connections to the makerspace capabilities at Mosul Space\nEntrepreneurship: Could strengthen the business creation aspects to align with young entrepreneurs focus\nProposed Revised Structure\nI recommend maintaining four modules but restructuring them to better incorporate heritage elements and entrepreneurial opportunities:\nModule 1: Green Building Assessment & Site Planning\nTarget: Sustainability Consultants/Auditors\nKeep as currently designed\nAdd section on evaluating heritage structures using the Green Building Code\nModule 2: Solar Energy Systems & Implementation\nTarget: Solar System Designers/Installers\nKeep as currently designed\nAdd component on integrating solar with traditional building forms\nModule 3: Heritage Renovation & Thermal Performance\nTarget: Heritage Restoration Specialists\nREVISED FOCUS: Combine thermal performance with heritage renovation\nEmphasize adapting traditional cooling/ventilation techniques (malqafs, courtyards)\nInclude documentation of heritage structures and retrofit methodologies\nDevelop restoration techniques that preserve character while improving performance\nModule 4: Sustainable Construction Entrepreneurship & Digital Fabrication\nTarget: Construction Entrepreneurs/Innovative Builders\nREVISED FOCUS: Entrepreneurship-focused with makerspace integration\nDevelop business models for sustainable construction services\nUse digital fabrication to create modular components inspired by heritage elements\nCreate prototypes and market-ready solutions using makerspace facilities\nInclude pitching skills and business plan development\nRationale for This Structure\nThis revised structure:\nPreserves Job Pathways: Each module still creates distinct employment opportunities\nElevates Heritage: Module 3 now specifically focuses on heritage renovation\nLeverages Makerspace: Module 4 directly connects to Mosul Space's fabrication capabilities\nEnhances Entrepreneurship: Stronger focus on business creation in Module 4\nMaintains Technical Depth: Each module still provides in-depth technical training\nImplementation Considerations\nFor Module 3 (Heritage Renovation & Thermal Performance), consider:\nDocumenting local heritage buildings as case studies\nCreating a material library of traditional and compatible modern materials\nDeveloping assessment methods specific to heritage structures\nDesigning hands-on activities for appropriate renovation techniques\nFor Module 4 (Sustainable Construction Entrepreneurship), consider:\nPartnering with local construction businesses for mentorship\nCreating a product development process using the makerspace\nDeveloping templates for sustainable construction business models\nBuilding prototypes that solve specific local challenges\nThis approach would create a more comprehensive program that addresses the heritage aspect you're concerned about while maintaining focus on creating employment opportunities aligned with Output 3.3's objectives.\nDoes this proposed restructuring address your concerns about the heritage element while maintaining practical job-focused training?\nRetry\nBG\nI don't think we need to over emphasize the makerspace element and I sort of like the insulation component connecting to heritage, although the solar panel element is clear, you go and you learn how to install solar panels and design systems, i thought maybe the insulation one can be like that too, - although much of what makes the heritage designs so good is about the materiality - it's not all of it, it's layout, orientation, green space, shade, trees, mesh, wind, review and come up with 3 module approaches. Design a selection critieria for the module approahces based on my TOR, the content you have from Salih, the outcome 3 content and critique them and select one.\nEdit\nCritiquing module approaches to select most effective design\n1m, 3s\nI'll develop three module approaches based on the requirements and critique them to select the most appropriate one. Let me organize my thinking around this task:\nFirst, I'll establish evaluation criteria based on the TOR, Salih's notes, and Outcome 3 content\nThen I'll develop three different module approaches\nFinally, I'll evaluate and select the most appropriate approach\nEvaluation Criteria\nFrom the TOR (Terms of Reference):\nModules should enhance skills of young people and women in sustainable construction\nFocus on green and innovative practices\nBalance theoretical knowledge with practical learning\nEnable participants to apply learning in real-world contexts\nInclude monitoring and evaluation framework\nSupport job creation and employability\nIntegrate financial literacy elements\nFrom Salih's notes:\nMake modules more technical and practical\nExtend modules to make them deeper and more employable\nEach module should be standalone with potential for internship/job placement\nMerge financial literacy into the modules rather than having it separate\nInclude practical components (simplified sustainable home design, electrical system mapping, thermal insulation calculations, heritage element integration)\nFrom Outcome 3 content:\nStrengthen capacities of local businesses, particularly young entrepreneurs\nIntegration of green and innovative practices in operations\nAlign with business needs to ensure practical and relevant training\nEmphasis on climate-smart solutions and innovative construction technologies\nBuild a resilient local economy\nAdditional concern about heritage:\nEnsure sustainable heritage elements are incorporated\nConsider traditional materials, layouts, orientation, green space, shade, trees, mesh, and wind elements\nThree Module Approaches\nApproach 1: Technical-Specialization Focus\nFour specialized technical modules focused on direct employment pathways:\nGreen Building Assessment & Code Compliance\nFocus on Iraqi Green Building Code application\nBuilding performance evaluation techniques\nSite planning and environmental analysis\nFinancial analysis of green building investments\nSolar Energy Systems Implementation\nComprehensive solar PV design and installation\nSystem sizing, component selection and integration\nPerformance monitoring and optimization\nBusiness models for solar installation services\nThermal Insulation & Climate Control\nBuilding envelope assessment and improvement\nInsulation materials, techniques and installation\nTraditional and modern ventilation strategies\nCost-benefit analysis of thermal improvements\nHeritage-Informed Sustainable Design\nTraditional architectural principles and application\nClimate-responsive design integrating heritage elements\nMaterials selection balancing tradition and performance\nBusiness development for heritage renovation services\nApproach 2: Integrated Skills Progression\nThree more integrated modules that build on each other but still function independently:\nBuilding Assessment & Performance Fundamentals\nGreen building code fundamentals and site assessment\nBasic thermal principles and envelope evaluation\nIntroduction to renewable energy systems\nFinancial literacy foundations for construction projects\nTechnical Systems Implementation\nSolar energy system design and installation\nAdvanced insulation and ventilation techniques\nIntegration of traditional cooling strategies with modern systems\nProject management and cost estimation\nSustainable Construction Entrepreneurship\nHeritage preservation and adaptive reuse\nClimate-responsive architectural design\nDigital fabrication and innovative construction methods\nBusiness planning and market development\nApproach 3: Thematic Environmental Response\nThree modules organized around environmental challenges rather than technical specialties:\nEnergy Independence & Generation\nSolar resource assessment and system design\nBuilding orientation and passive solar strategies\nTraditional energy conservation approaches\nFinancial models for energy independence\nThermal Comfort & Environmental Quality\nBuilding envelope assessment and improvement\nHeritage-inspired ventilation and cooling strategies\nIndoor air quality and comfort solutions\nCost-effective thermal retrofits\nSustainable Materials & Construction Methods\nTraditional and modern sustainable materials\nHeritage construction techniques with modern applications\nWaste reduction and circular building practices\nBusiness models for sustainable construction services\nEvaluation of Approaches\nLet me evaluate each approach against our key criteria:\nApproach 1: Technical-Specialization Focus\nStrengths:\nClear employment pathways in specific technical areas\nComprehensive technical depth in each subject\nDistinct skill sets that match market needs\nHeritage considerations have dedicated module\nWeaknesses:\nMay create siloed knowledge rather than integrated understanding\nFour modules might be more resource-intensive to develop and deliver\nSome overlap in fundamental knowledge across modules\nApproach 2: Integrated Skills Progression\nStrengths:\nFewer modules (three instead of four) with integrated knowledge\nProgressive skill building can accommodate different entry levels\nEach module still functions independently\nEntrepreneurship focus in final module supports business creation\nWeaknesses:\nLess specialized depth in specific technical areas\nMay be challenging to keep modules truly independent\nHeritage elements more distributed across modules\nApproach 3: Thematic Environmental Response\nStrengths:\nDirectly addresses environmental challenges rather than technical divisions\nThree focused modules align well with primary building concerns in Iraq\nHeritage elements integrated throughout based on environmental solutions\nClear connection to traditional wisdom for each environmental challenge\nWeaknesses:\nEmployment pathways may be less clearly defined\nPossibly less alignment with conventional industry divisions\nMay require more customization for Iraqi market\nSelection and Recommendation\nAfter weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach against our criteria, I believe Approach 3: Thematic Environmental Response best meets our needs because:\nIt organizes knowledge around the environmental challenges that actually need to be solved, rather than arbitrary technical divisions\nIt naturally integrates heritage elements as solutions to environmental challenges\nIt reduces the number of modules to three while maintaining comprehensive coverage\nEach module creates multiple potential employment pathways while building integrated skills\nThe thematic organization encourages innovative thinking and problem-solving\nIt aligns well with the \"climate-smart solutions\" emphasis in Outcome 3.3\nThe focus on environmental responses rather than technical specializations allows for more natural integration of heritage elements as solutions that have been refined over centuries to address Iraq's climate challenges.\nThis approach also better supports entrepreneurial thinking by organizing around problems to be solved rather than pre-defined technical specialties, which aligns with the emphasis on young entrepreneurs in Outcome 3.3.\nI'll now present this analysis and recommendation.\n"

                "text": "The Ministry of Electricity (MoE) is one of Iraq’s most significant sectoral ministries. Despite massive amount invested in power generation, the country is plagued by power outages for more than three decades. One of the most common sources of the problem and significant impact on the waste of public funds in contractual processes. The Ministry of Planning issued regulations and procedures to facilitate the implementation of power plants by applying the sectorial standard bidding documents (SSBD) of design, supply, and installation of the electromechanical project to support MoE by developing economic projects that lead to raising Iraqi electricity generation field. The research evaluates the government evaluation procedures applied in SSBD and their impact on Iraqi power plant contracts. The study’s principal data gathering approaches via interviews with consultants resulted in a structured questionnaire that includes 25 criteria delivered to MoE’s senior staff.\n\nSSBD of design, supply, and installation of electromechanical works is a new document; there is a limited level of experience with it, developed and issued by MoP to support MoE’s general companies in implementing power plant construction projects. The research is limited only to investigating and assessing the impact of evaluation and qualification criteria that influence MoE’s decision for SSBD for the procurement of power plants in Iraq. The public procurement procedures are a key government instrument for boosting and focusing investment and development possibilities, improving the national economy, and enhancing local and federal government planning, budgeting, and monitoring capacities [22,23]. The SSBD has been certified for use in the construction of a plant related to the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of specially engineered plants and equipment, as well as the construction of civil works under a single responsibility contract when the value of the plant and \n\nThe author believed that the criteria mentioned in this research were appropriate in the environment of Iraq, and according to the results in Table 6, the essential factors were “Bid Compliance with Employer’s Technical Requirement,” “Annual Revenues Average,” “compulsory spare parts and maintenance services,” “Financial Resources,” “Specialized Experience,” and “The Bid Price”; while other main critical factors have the least importance like the operation and maintenance cost in financial and economic evaluation, which is an essential factor for power plant’s life cycle cost and the subcontractor’s qualification is also an essential factor in bids’ evaluation. Due to the lack of experience with SSBD of plants, it is recommended that MoP develop a user guide for the SSBD design, supply, and installation of electromechanical work applications to ensure sustainable procurement.\n\nNoori H, Rasheed S.

Her Master’s Degree in 2005 focused on “Social Sustainability”, namely” The Impact of Local Communities on Eco-lodge Design Criteria”. Whereas, her PHD in 2010 focused on a newly emerging discipline in Egypt at that time, which is “Facility Management”. Since then, the research work of Dr. Laila has focused generally on Facility Management, Construction Project Management and the application of Management as a broad term in teaching Architecture. Up to date, She has published more that 45 papers either in peer reviewed journals, or in international conferences. In addition\n\nFields of Interest: Sustainable Design, Facility Management, Maintenance Management, Building Performance Evaluation, Construction Project Management, Risk Management, Quality Management and Control, Change Management Practices, Marketing Management for Construction Projects, Capacity Management, Value Engineering. Dr. Nessim obtained his B.Sc. in Architectural Engineering from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt in 2000. He was ranked among the top 5 out of 240 students in his class; thus, he was appointed as a teaching assistant at the same Architectural Department. Dr. Nessim is no stranger to the higher education field, having spent ten years as a Demonstrator and a Lecturer Assistant at the Department of Architecture (FEDA), Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University, which taught him the importance of being up-to-date regarding the scientific material and various course contents.\n\nArchitectural Education methods are facing challenges named “21st Century Competencies” which affect the employability of the fresh graduates. Accordingly, several higher educational institutions are changing their teaching methods to equip students with skills that support them with lifelong learning capabilities. This research aims at assessing the current skills that are transferred through AE versus the Architecture Engineering and Construction industry job market in Egypt and to propose an approach to fill the gap between both. A literature review was performed. Afterwards, a questionnaire targeting a sample of 100 fresh-graduates’ and senior students was carried out and aimed at identifying the current challenges facing the integration of the required skills. A 360 degrees’ evaluation was performed to assess the students’ views. In addition, fifteen one-to-one interviews were done with professionals and academics to identify the AEC market needs.\n\nDr. Nessim’s Master of Science was related mainly to the environmental studies with special focus on Daylighting. He was granted his M.Sc. degree in 2006 fom Ain Shams University. On the other hand, his Philosophical Doctorate main theme was the exterior lighting of heritage buildings and the surrounding environment. He was granted his Ph.D. degree in 2011. Currently, Dr. Nessim is a Lecturer in the Architecture Field and holds his Ph.D. degree from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. As for his professional practice, Dr. Nessim worked, since he graduated, as a part-time expert with two national architectural firms for several projects located in Egypt, U.A.E., and Sultanate of Oman. Dr. Nessim has several published scientific researches, participated in organizing several international conferences and workshops, and attended a number of architectural related conferences.",
